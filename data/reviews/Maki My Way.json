{"text":"Went with friends for lunch and enjoyed an excellent meal!  Nice, bright, clean atmosphere is very welcoming. Also, was greeted on this occasion by the friendly owner Rob as well as Bianca who both ensured all received great service.

The main part of my lunch was a great chicken teriyaki bento box.  Yummy!  Also had the chance to try some different rolls and pork katsu that others in my group tried - it was all very, very good and well-priced too.

I look forward to coming back to Maki My Way and also it's second location opening downtown (also) in 2016!"}
{"text":"My favorite take out Japanese restaurant in downtown Toronto. Always fresh and very friendly service. If you need something quick and fresh, try Maki my way!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm the first to review this place!  Stopped in on my way home from work and will definitely be back.  Really friendly service, and sushi & miso were both delicious.  The options for customizing your own roll are a little overwhelming at first,  because they have a huge variety of ingredients - but it means you could definitely get creative."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to have a late night dinner after a show and we stumbled upon maki my way. We walked down King St. and one of the servers had just come outside with a tray of sample sushi. I tried the spicy salmon crunch, which was average compared to authentic japanese sushi I have tried before. However, it did lure the both of us to see what they had inside. 

When we entered, we were greeted by the friendly workers who introduced us to the menu and explained to us how their restaurant worked. The customer service is excellent and very welcoming. 

Both my friend and I were fairly tired so we decided to get bento boxes as we didn't have the energy to make our own sushi. 

I tried the Pork Belly Bento while my friend got the Pork Katsu. The price of one after tax is $14.15. The prices are a bit on the expensive side, hindering me from giving it a 5 star rating. 

We sat at the table as they told us they would serve us the food. First came a miso soup, which was a surprise. But be warned as it is very salty. I was not able to finish the soup because of the sodium levels but I did eat the tofu and the seaweed in it as they were delicious. 

Our bentos came shortly after in a cute plastic tray. 
It came with a side of seaweed salad, two fried dumplings, and some california rolls. 

The pork belly was thick and juicy and went well with the sweet sauce. I do have to say that the sauce did not possess much flavour but sweetness, but I am a sugar person so I loved it. I did also try some of my friends pork katsu which is on par with other pork katsus that I have tried elsewhere. The vegetables tasted okay but they were soft and perhaps overcooked? However the main dish was delicious! The dumplings were also very good and I believe contained some hidden ingredients that made them tastier. (; 

After we finished eating a server came and took our trays away. We sat for a while after to digest our food when, I believe the manager, came in and asked if we wanted to try the frozen yogurt. We agreed and each got a pretty big sample size of a green tea/tart flavour mix. The first bite I took left me speechless. It was sweet and alluring. The tart flavour was delicious and tasted like a fruit tart. I could not taste a strong green tea taste perhaps masked by the tart but it was a perfect dessert. 

The price of the frozen yogurt is a bit on the expensive side as well but it is definitely worth a try. 

If you are looking for a quick meal or some dessert after dinner then this is a good place to eat. The service is amazing and the bentos are tasty. 
I will definitely come here again in the future."}
{"text":"I placed an order via just eat and made sure I put a note in the additional instruction section that I have an Avacado allergy, and to please exclude it from all my rolls. I inspected the 4 rolls we had ordered and it looked like cucumber had substituted the avacado as usual. I was unfortunately surprised by my last bites with huge chunks of avacado. It looks like they started to make the Roll and realized it was not supposed to have any in it, but rather then start from scratch they attempted to remove it, but did not take out a few of the chunks.  Lucky me!!! Now my throat is tightning, my face and tounge are swelling. Thank you chef for following instructions."}
{"text":"After walking along king along King street and tried to find something \"new\" or at least a new place, we saw this fellow standing there with a tray of sample sushi. My partner was hungry and after tasting the sample, we went in this new place Maki My Way. 

It is a take out place with a few tables but we figured that we will try it out. 
The server is also a cashier. She is an Asian young lady who was quite  pushy in trying to get us to order. She did not explain anything (we found out afterwards because the owner/food sampler explained in detail to another table who happened to be beside us) and kept coming back and asked \"are you ready\" ?  She did tell us to order the Love Boat, the most expensive food in their take out menu. 

After she came back 3 times in 5 minutes, we ordered the Love Boat and what a mistake it was!  It is a $39.99 entree for 2 and I figured that it would be okay. 

What you get is this: (price is calculated based on their al la carte menu)

1. \"Japanese\" salad - garden salad with wilted lettuce, tomato. My partner did not notice that there were red edges around the lettuce - an in indication of old lettuce.  It came with ginger salad dressing in the take out ketchup containers. I did not eat the salad because I do not enjoy red edged salad leaves. 

Two Tiny bowls of miso soup (4 oz soup) in a disposable bowl $2.50 per bowl so total of $5.00 
2. One piece of tempura shrimp, one piece of broccoli and carrot deep fried ($1.75 for the shrimp - calculated from $3.50 for 2 shrimps and $1.75 for 2 pieces of tempura vegetables) , total of ($7.00)
3. 4 pieces of salmon sashimi which was not assorted . I saw the other two tables got different fish with their sashmi appetizer or came with their small platter. ($4.00) 
4. One edamame ($2.50)
5. One California roll ($7.50) which was small in size and poorly wrapped 
6. One spicy salmon roll ($7.50) which was not spicy and had tiny Chunks of salmon. 
7. Four sushi (they gave us salmon only and really why? The other tables who orders the  small platter all got assorted fish) ($4.00) 

All in all, it almost added up to $40.00 but why bother giving people an impression that the Love Boat is a combo deal especially the food quality and quantity does not come up to par. 

We got all salmon sushi, sashimi and not spicy salmon roll . I could have ordered all al la carte and get better choices. 

There was 4 pieces of pickled ginger on our \"platter\" 
When we asked for more, the server came back with a tiny take out container of ginger (the type you put ketchup in) and it was two slices of ginger.  This is a poor service and cheap delivery. 

Maybe being Asian, she might think that we are tourists so why bother with good service. The other tables had good service, their platter had ginger and wasabi and yes, the Italian (just guessing ) owner explained the food choice in detail. 

After dinner, we were told that the TIPS must be paid in cash and the food can be paid with credit card. What kind of rule is that ? 
They did not post it on the outside .


Mediocre food gets mediocre tips...so we gave her 10% tip and left..

Do not go to this place unless your time is limited and you just want to eat something. Go line up at O and B canteen. You will get much better service and food! 

Or walk up to Queen street and go to sushi time !  

Did I mention that everything came in disposable containers and you have to clean up your own table."}
{"text":"I've walked by this sushi place on a regular basis since it opened last year but have always failed to give it a try as it never seemed to distinguish itself in the din of restaurants along King Street's Restaurant Row. I had my first sampling a couple of weeks ago with a group of friends and found the sushi and appetizers fairly good. More notable was the owner's efforts to accommodate and make the customers comfortable. The stand out characteristic of this sushi bar is that they offer customization for your rolls: choose from beef, chicken, kani (crab), salmon, tilapia, cooked shrimp, tempura shrimp, masago, tofu, tamago (egg). They also have a set menu of course and I was hungry so I  shared the Pork Belly and Chicken bento boxes with a friend. I found that the chicken was more to my liking as it had a fresh flavour to it while the pork belly seemed too much like thick bacon. Of their appetizers I found their gyoza and particularly, the pork karage particularly tasty.

It says on their website that the owners wanted to open a \"fast, casual, Japanese-themed establishment that understands & is deeply passionate about its customers.\" In this they have succeeded."}
{"text":"I had a very satisfying lunch at Maki My Way. I did not try the custom rolls, but I ordered one of their rolls off the menu, and it was rolled fresh for me. 
There are to-go pre-made roll containers, but that is if you are in a hurry. 

The roll I had was very, very good quality. The rice was right, and all the ingredients were really fresh and plentiful. The portion looks small, but I was really full after that I even delayed eating my dinner (I eat a lot. Like, I never order salads when I go out). 

I thought the price was very reasonable (rolls start from $7.50 and up), and this is actually the best quick-service sushi joint experience I had in the downtown core. By quick-service,  I mean don't bring your girlfriend for a special treat (don't do it, bro) or a visiting aunt from out of town. The feel and set up is very much like a bubble tea cafe. It is more of a lunch place, especially compared to the dinner options on the street.

The cashiers are also semi-servers and they were very professional and well-trained; they will bring the roll to you when it is done in a disposable plastic container, with chopstick and soy sauce (you get to choose low-sodium or regular).

They also had tons of hot food options, which I didn't get to try. I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer of Maki My Way and I would like to congratulate them on providing consistently delicious, quality sushi. I have ordered soup, salad, sashimi, rolls and most recently a sushi burrito. Everything has been fresh and very well prepared. All of it surpassing other delivery sushi restaurants in the city. Where else can you get quality sushi prepared exactly as you want it for a reasonable price in Toronto? Maki My Way exceeds all expectations."}
{"text":"First of all, great staff. The lady was Japanese and (of course) had that deep respect that's so unique to the Japanese culture. 

The thing is, the product isn't bad, not by any means. For the style of restaurant (take-out/fast food), the maki is good. The reason I can't give out a four or five star rating here is because of the price. At a mid-teir sushi place, a salmon roll is the same price as it is here, but, understandably comes fresher and with better presentation and higher quality ingredients. 

So again, the maki isn't bad. Its what you would expect from this type of place, but for the same price as dine-in, higher quality rolls."}
{"text":"A bit scary to design your own sushi rolls... but go do it... Wow. I really enjoyed the combination I designed.
If you are not up for adventure you can order some of the basics and it seems there is fresh sushi pre-made if you need to dash in and out... but honestly I didn't look there.
Staff was helpful with a suggestion or two and the owner (I think), was also helpful and focused on clients enjoying the experience and food. 
Serving sizes were reasonable, the fish / veggies were fresh and the presentation was thoughtful.
I happened upon this Maki My Way by accident, I'll be back and I've already recommended this place to friends to enjoy the adventure and sushi."}
{"text":"If you like fresh great sushi, this is the place. It is like a chipotle of sushi...you can build your own sushi roll. The owner Rob was so helpful and nice. The sushi platter was awesome. It is a bright friendly place to eat in the theater district"}
{"text":"It is a small sushi restaurant but it has a nice feel to it. The place is clean and funky!
The waitress that served us tonight was nice and attentive. She brought cups of water and even offered us two types of soy sauce.
We ordered the small sushi order for 1-2 people (we were 3). You could choose 3 different rolls (8 sushis each) and you would also get 4 different nigiris.
The food was fresh and good. The Dynamite sushi was our favourite one!

We will be going back to this place in my next visit to Toronto"}
{"text":"Great variety of choices and the prices are pretty nice. An appetizer and a roll filled me up. Got the veggie tempura and the veggie roll #2."}
{"text":"Cons
- The atmosphere looks like a cheap fast food joint. The decor is really lacking
- They skimp out on the salmon in their rolls. They are tiny compared to other Japanese restaurants

Pros
- Despite the lack of fish in their sushi, their sushi actually taste really good. I eat out at a lot of Japanese restaurants and this restaurant has one of the freshest and highest quality ingredients. I dont think you'll have to worry about getting tape worms by eating their sushi.

- Customer service is friendly and they speak fluent English. I have ordered my sushi over the phone and the take out is experience was painless."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery the other night based on decent Yelp reviews but was really disappointed with the quality.  We ordered the small maki/nigiri platter and the rolls were falling apart as we picked them up.  They were not rolled tightly enough and did not have enough rice at the ends to keep them together.  I will say that they were generous with the amount of wasabi and ginger that was provided which was really nice but overall unfortunately the food just wasn't good enough to make me want to eat there/order again."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the food is what you would expect from a mid range sushi place.  You can make your own rolls though often times I've gotten one of the premade rolls..  Great for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The only reason why I give it a star is because the service is indeed good. The owner is very welcoming and eager to explain the menu. However, food-wise it was a very bad experience. Had I not had take-out, I would have definitely requested a refund. 

I didn't feel like rice so I asked about seafood salad - the photos on the menu looked good. I was told it comes with various selections of veggies and some seafood incld salmon sashimi, shrimp and one other item which I can't recall what it was. No tuna. I requested to have more salmon sashimi and no other items. In addition, I requested to add tuna sashimi. The bill came to just over $14!! Which I thought was a tid bit expensive given the size of the plastic container that I was presented with. I did take out so I grabbed my plastic bag and headed out

I was beyond disappointed when I opened the bag at home: my \"seafood salad\" consisted of a handful of chopped lettuce, three thinly sliced pieces of salmon sashimi and three equally thinly sliced pieces of tuna sashimi. Nothing else! I was staring at it for probably 5 minutes, then still hopeful tried digging around the plastic box in hopes of finding more sashimi or at least a slice of cucumber - NADA!

This was beyond disappointing and had it not been -20 degrees outside I would have definitely gone back to request a refund. Just save your money and go elsewhere where $14 can buy you more than 2 leaves of lettuce and 6 paper-thin slices of fish."}
{"text":"Okay this place is awesome. I'm an avid TIFF volunteer and finding a decent place to get a quick bite that wont cost an arm and a leg and taste GREAT is so hard to find in this area. When I first went to Maki My Way, I was so happy to finally get my fave food item in this neighbourhood. It's actually really great food and I don't mind the throw away containers they come in either. Plus bonus that they sell beer! I like to call it a hybrid of a restaurant and a take away place. Gotta support business's like this so they don't go away!!"}
{"text":"I am really glad to have found this cute location which happens to be closer to my work place. My coworkers and I tried their sushi burrito (dynamite supreme)...Wow so good it made my taste buds so happy. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I recently ordered catering for a small office get together.  For the 5 of us, we ordered a large platter, 5 Chicken Karages, and a Veggie Bento box (for my vegetarian co-worker). The food came fast and fresh!  We absolutely devoured the food and will be ordering more for sure!  A little diamond in the heart of downtown."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a noodle soup and I was at MEC on a rainy evening. The chicken udon did the trick but I would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Just came by with the hubs to try out their sushi burrito. Tried the Dynamite supreme...was so delicious. We also ordered the chicken karage and had it with mayo and the garlic sauce on the side.  It was perfect combination of crunchy, flavourful and savoury - totally crave-worthy!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wanted a quick bite after the aquarium. Checked in for a free appie....nice bonus. Food was very fresh. Miso soup was tasty....could have been a touch warmer. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices.  The Dynamite and Rainbow roll were excellent. My Son has the Bento Box and wife had the 2 Vegan rolls. All had excellent reviews."}
{"text":"The place is bright and clean. Love the concept of being able to create your own maki, cool idea! The service is great the people are nice. I had a few of their signature rolls and made a maki of my own and loved them all. My Fav signature roll is the veggie lover! I tried the bao sandwiches, you get 3 in a box, they make a great meal for the non sushi lover. With lots of variety in their menu you won't be disappointed, and they serve beer and wine!!!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think this bright little place would serve alcohol, but you can purchase beer, wine and sake! The sushi is consistently good, the fish is fresh and the rice has a nice texture. Some of the rolls are pretty creative, and my favorite is the cajun albacore. As for the create your own roll, there are loads of options! I recently tried their vegetarian rolls even though I'm not vegetarian, and they were pretty good. Also, their pork belly yakisoba is delicious. Overall a convenient and casual place to stop by for lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi, so fresh and tasty! Service is exceptional. The manager is so friendly and helpful. Great for kids who love sushi and very close to local attractions."}
{"text":"Maki My Way has been opened since December 2014, but it was their Grand Opening today? 
 
I was walking along King this afternoon and the storefront caught my attention with the bright green sign, Grand Opening  and \"custom sushi experience\", so I ventured in for an afternoon snack.

It was late afternoon and the place was completely empty,  except for the four staff members behind the counter,  plus perhaps the manager who went to the back room.

The place was nice, very clean and colourful with exposed brick walls, track lighting and LCD screens to display the menu.  At first the menu looked overwhelming,  but it was actually quite simple to read and their \"Maki My Way\" was a great concept.   

Staff were overly friendly and greeted me upon entering, plus explained the menu concept while I was looking over the menu since they asked if it was my first time.

Custom sushi experience - you choose and they roll: I was able to select upon many options my choice of protein, choice of two fruits/vegetables, choice of a sauce, one topping and wrap (soya or seaweed).  For $7.99, I received 8 pieces and added a miso soup and green tea for an extra $2.99.  Turns out to be an expensive snack for me, but for a meal it's reasonably priced.  

I ordered to dine in: I placed my order at the counter,  took a seat, and one staff member brought me my food. Simple food ordering, prompt and friendly service with a smile. My kind of place!

I was expecting real dinnerware since I dined in, but was disappointed when I received disposables, almost  like I ordered takeout minus the lids. Guess it's fast food sushi!

My maki rolls were firmly wrapped and neatly presented along with some tempura sweet potato pieces. The salmon was fresh, plus the maki rolls were tasty to my liking since I chose all the ingredients my way.   The kimchee mayo was quite mild, but very flavourful.  It was definitely a custom sushi experience.

I recommend you try Maki My Way for a custom sushi experience your way."}
{"text":"My kids and I found this place last week. Met the manager, Rob who was very friendly and the service was great. I tried their Spicy salmon crunch sushi burrito and it was so good. I appreciated how all ingredients were so fresh. Tried some of their signature sauces which were delicious. Like how I could customize my maki rolls. I will come back to try that."}
{"text":"Im impressed how fast this sushi place is. Waiting is out of question. If your hungry  this is the place you need. The service was good and the owner was really friendly. I would definitely gonna come back and try to create my own sushi."}
{"text":"This place serves low quality food on disposable plates, bowls, etc. The food is below average and atmosphere more like a cafe than a dining experience. 
I cannot imagine how this restaurant gets 4 stars legitimately. Location in the tourist theatre district raised alarm bells for me, should have avoided it but trusted the 4 star rating on yelp. There are countless average and above average sushi restaurants in T.O, this is not one to bother with. 
Price was reasonable but not a good value relative to the quality. 
We had Miso soup in paper bowls( pretty good), veggie platter and dynamite rolls (below average quality and presentation) , tempura ( super greasy, lacking that light fried quality you want) and dynamite (meh). 
Staff are friendly but messed up the order. Water glass was dirty.
To sum it up my wife said we should have gone to A&W instead. Ha!"}
{"text":"I work  a block away from here and decided to try it for the first time today.  I ordered the spicy salmon crunch, and spring rolls. They were really great! The salmon rolls tasted fresh, and had the perfect crunch. I'm sooooooooo happy because I used to work in the Annex, so I was missing affordable sushi shops, and walking to queen street is just too much effort on my lunch hour. The sushi god's obviously listened to my prayers and Maki My Way appeared. 

I'm assuming the man who I ordered from was the owner. He was awesome, genuine and took the time to explain the menu to me. 

I usually brown-bag it to work, but I think I'm going to pay this place a visit once or twice a week as my regular lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing new concept and it's so nice to be able to grab something quick in this area instead of a full sit-down meal. 
Cool decor, sweet staff and yummy food :)"}
{"text":"DEADLY salty & sweet teriyaki sauce in the bento box! Nice California rolls add a star to this review."}
{"text":"The service is stellar. The manager explained everything clearly to us the first time we went there and remembered us when we returned. Though the \"build your own\" sushi is a tad expensive, you're paying for what I would say is pretty good quality.
Great for lunch, especially if you're looking to take out."}
{"text":"This place is an insult to asian cuisine. They have to give out free samples to drive traffic since no-one cares to eat there. Not one employee is smiling and everything is a day old!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced. They served the green tea in a take out cup. Which was good for keeping it warm. The owner gave us samples of one of appetizer which was really nice. I ordered a beef teriyaki bento box and upgraded my California role to a spicy salmon role for 50cents extra, which was a very nice option. The meat and rice were good but it's had that pre-package taste and feel to it. Very good price range and a great healthy option."}
{"text":"Delicious! 

Ordered a super salmon crunch burrito and was pleasantly surprised, especially given that I've never tried sushi in burrito form until today. 

There was a promotional price on the Ritual ordering app to get a full size for $11 (I believe regular price is $16).

Ingredients were very fresh, particularly the salmon sashimi and avocado which is key! The portion of salmon was generous and appropriate for the burrito's size and there was also the perfect amount of sushi rice (which is very little rice, yay). 

All in all a very satisfying meal served by friendly staff. My only concern is portion size - full is hefty in price and weight and I can't finish the whole thing. The smaller portion, however, is expensive given it may not be quite substantial enough as a full meal."}
{"text":"All plastic! Could not believe that they have no re-usable plates or cups for eating-in. Everything is served in plastic containers! Had burnt udon soup in a melting plastic bowl, ok dumplings, and so so veggie roll. Very average food overall, not at all authentic or Japanese. Nice people working there but a disappointing experience food wise."}
{"text":"Great service, really attentive to your needs and was there to explain their new concept to Toronto.

Their sushi maki rolls were good, we got salmon, avocado and cucumber. It was nice to get it freshly made - really shines through in the taste.

The udon with beef and pork Katsu was mediocre at best. Probably wouldn't order it again. 

Delivery and having their liquor license is a plus! May come back for their Sapporo specials."}
{"text":"Great place ! Food is fast and simple Service is awesome would always come back to it when visiting Toronto ."}
{"text":"Are you like me where there's always that 1 ingredient in a roll that you wish wasn't there?  Well now you're in luck since this restaurant allows you to customize your perfect roll.  You get 8 pieces with your choice of a protein (seafood and tofu are available), 2 veggies or fruit, and 1 topping (masago, sesame or tempura crunch) wrapped in either soya or seaweed then topped with your choice of sauce.  

If that is just too much thinking involved for you there's signature rolls, main dishes and snacks for you to choose from as well. Think your typical sushi menu items - nothing fancy.

You don't like sushi? Not a problem - they have udon, bao, fried noodles and bento boxes to name a few.

I have eaten in the restaurant and ordered delivery and was very happy with the customer service on both occasions.  The staff is super friendly and helpful in explaining the menu.

I would eat here again if I wanted quick, no frills, cheap sushi.

Bonus: they have Sapporo on tap, sake and Ramune!"}
{"text":"It is what it is, a DIY food court style sushi takeout.
The mains are nothing special but they do the trick and are priced reasonably.

I've only had DIY veggie sushi so I can't speak to the quality of the fish, but what I had was fresh and yummy. 

The owner is also active on twitter and answered my menu question which was appreciated."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. 100% recommendable. Sushi burrito is delicious!! A must spot in the city"}
{"text":"pricey and mediocre... there's better options in this neighborhood... Such as Tsushi, CJ's lunch box or Saku"}
{"text":"Love this little lunch/dinner spot! Great place to grab some food if you're looking for a quick snack before the movies or the baseball game. The people who run this place are also super friendly and helpful. Every time I go in everyone has huge smiles on their faces, how can you not love that? 

I love their concept of make your own sushi. Especially because I have some crazy dietary restrictions and sometimes going out for AYCE with friends can be a huge pain for me.  

Also two tips* The check-in offer is a great one; One free app with purchase! And if you go near the end of the day they have a 30% off any grab and go sushi. Woo!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chirachi bowl to go and it's horrible. The fish is old, some of it don't even look the right  color. Don't go there, you'll get food poisoning!"}
{"text":"Maki my way doesn't even make maki! Worst sushi ever. The waiter / cashier messed up our order twice! Even when one was an allergy! On top of all that our tummys were not agreeing with us all night."}
{"text":"Customizable sushi? Yes please!!! While the menu might seem overwhelming, I love that such an option in Toronto exists. I wish I had the time to really customize my sushi order but being pressed for time I ordered the spicy salmon and shrimp tempura. 

The presentation is very fast food i.e. take out containers and cutlery. The Spicy Salmon was average to good which I expect from every sushi restaurant but nothing to write home about. The shrimp tempura left me wanting a bit more. The batter was really soft and mushy. I like mine crunchy and crispy but if you like yours limp and soft - this is the place to go. They the Japanese cream soda available here (please don't try at your own risk because you will be hooked and will regret that you ever lived without this beverage for so many years!!!)

The decor and layout is cool and funky with no stereotypical Japanese/Asian elements which I do appreciate. 

The service and staff were SUPER SUPER friendly which is why I gave it 4 stars despite the food being average. 

Would I go back? Yes if the prices were lowered just a wee bit as I can't justify eating there for the cost when there is no shortage of sushi restaurants in Toronto. Secondly, If they got the tempura right but that's just my preference I suppose - although I'm sure most people would want their deep fried tempura to be crispy, no?

I think the place is still new and leaves customers wanting more. I will go back in a few months and try the customizable sushi and update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner date after a long day at work, we were looking for some sushi at an affordable price, downtown core area. Yelp helped us identify the spot, and had it not been for the decently high rating I would've overlooked the place as a fast food spot. The location is right across from the TIFF Lightbox, and is set up very much like a grab and go fast food place. There were only a few tables and some bar stools, a very simple layout with open space probably meant for lineups or crowds waiting for their orders. We weren't sure if we had to order and then sit, but staff greeted us and directed us to a table for dine-in service. We were handed some menus - their takeout brochure really, and brought some chopsticks and napkins. Overall the place is cute and great for customization - a quick fix for food any meal of the day but not somewhere I'd rave about.

The menu is pretty simple and clearly designed for takeout. There's a variety of simple appetizers from miso soup to chicken karaage, a selection of bento boxes, specialty rolls, sashimi platters, set meals and combos, and the signature make your own maki roll. We went with a bento box each, chicken karaage to start, and a custom maki roll to share.

The bento box comes with miso soup, 4 pieces of California roll, choice of two gyoza or spring rolls, seaweed salad, and rice with choice of salmon, beef, pork, or veggie. It's quite a portion and definitely sufficient for a dinner meal, and quite affordable at $12.95. We noticed that everything is served in takeout-ready containers, and all the cutlery was disposable. I guess if you have leftovers of change your mind about staying, it's a quick ordeal having to only ask for some lids and bags. All the food comes at once, so chicken karaage showed up shortly after the bento boxes, and our custom roll followed. Our two-person small table barely fit all the items and the takeout trays made it feel a bit like a live Tetris game. 

The bento box items were generic but not disappointing, the salmon on my rice was tasty and not too salty or too flavoured. My gyoza were crunchy but still biteable and chewable, and were still hot inside. The miso soup was a bit bland, and the takeout container made it appear even more plain. Everything else was acceptable, no surprises good or bad.

The chicken karaage was not to our taste because there was a lot of fat and soft bones, and the pieces were rather irregularly sized. The batter/breading was crunchy but not flavourful. The chicken inside was quite dry as well. I won't be ordering this again!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. 

Had the small platter with dynamite, Korean and spicy crab rolls. dynamite was delicious. The Korean roll's sauce (kimchi sauce) was actually really good (for someone here who doesn't like kimchi) but it was hard to taste the beef in the roll (easily masked).  Edaname appetizer was really good too (just a bit uneven temperature between each one)."}
{"text":"I live just across the street and decided tonight I would try this little sushi place I walk by daily. I ordered Yakisoba beef noodles and spicy salmon roll half order. Both were DELICIOUS and very reasonably priced. The order took minutes and the manager and front cashier lady were very pleasant and friendly. Definitely a new go to for quick and tasty take out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. The food was just as expected with simple but flavorful ingredients. Will definitely visit again. The bento box is great with a good amount of food."}
{"text":"My new go-to sushi in the downtown core! 

The food is simply delicious, the staff are so friendly, and best of all - you get to customize your Maki rolls! It's a truly unique concept - one that I haven't seen at any other sushi or Japanese food restaurant, and it's honestly what keeps us coming back. I'm fairly picky (I absolutely hate cucumber in my sushi) so I get to customize a roll that is perfect for me - you pick the meat, sauce, what goes inside, etc. Literally the whole is can be customized so you can get creative with your sushi. Best of all - it tastes great and is some of the best sushi I've eaten. At the end of our meal, they gave us a free sample of the frozen yogurt as well to try out. I also used the Yelp redemption to get the free spring roll appetizer. 

Overall, simple an amazing experience. I've been there a bunch of times since discovering it, and now that they are on ritual, it makes it even easier to grab some sushi on my way home from the gym."}
{"text":"These place is sooo good and the service is really great. Great option for eat in or high quality quick togo sushi. You can choose one of their special rolls or make your own, which is pretty cool. The manager is also so lovely, he offers you tea sometimes while you wait for your togo order. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I needed a quick snack to ride me over until dinner with friends. A cold day meant miso soup and my standby spicy tuna. This was a very good roll, nice size, great flavor, and the fish seemed very fresh. Friendly staff and I had my food in less than 5 minutes. A great choice."}
{"text":"It's a nice shop on King. Convenient for people working in the area.
Employees (two girls working near the front) were friendly and greeted you upon entering (it was after lunch hours so it was pretty quiet at the time)

Ordered yakisoba noodles with chicken karaage and a green tea on the side through Ritual. Granted, this place has the word \"maki\" in it so presumably their specialties are on maki rolls, so maybe I should've picked something different.

Yakisoba noodles are fried, so naturally they would be a bit on the oily side. But this was probably the oiliest and saltiest bowl of fried noodles I've had so far. There wasn't much in terms of flavor, just lots of salty and lots of greasy. The chicken wasn't tender and juicy either and didn't have much flavor.

The green tea was just a lipton green tea bag filled with hot water. I'm surprised they would charge $1.50 for this, given that you can buy 100 of them for under $10.

I mean, I suppose it would be unfair to review a place based on one item and one drink, but definitely get a different item."}
{"text":"The sushi here was serviceable but reminded me of fancier grocery store sushi. I had a bento box with rolls, karage and veggies. Overpriced for sure, treated like something I could make at home. I guess it's to be expected if it's more of a take out place. They have lots of variety though."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at Maki My Way. I was in the area for a quick bite and did not want to have to wait long for my meal (but still have a decent one of course!) and this was one of the few restaurants in the area where I could do just that! 

I ordered a bento box with pork belly and rice, maki, seaweed salad and gyoza. I could taste the freshness of everything in my plate and enjoyed the favour of the pork belly.

Very laid back vibe. I appreciated that I could just grab any seat, and a server would bring me my tray of food with the option of low sodium soy sauce and carefully place it in front of me. I'm accustomed to this service which is also at Panera Bread and I think it's such a lovely touch of customer service and a most welcoming interaction.

Thank you Maki My Way! Hopefully next time I'll remember to check Yelp first so that I can unlock the offer of a free appetizer and create a customized maki roll for fun!"}
{"text":"Last weekend my friends and I came across this restaurant as we were in the area. It is definitely a place for take out or to have a quick meal. We ordered a large platter (72 pcs) which was ample for the 6 of us.
The sushi did fall apart easily. However, it was good (spicy salmon crunch was really good). 
The staff were very friendly and helpful as well. They were very familiar with the menu and were able to answer all our questions. They also helped us customize the menu to meet our desires.
We spent approximately $108 for 6 people and it included 72 pcs of sushi and 22 tempura shrimps. We also got one free appetizer as it was a check in offer via Yelp. So we chose the miso soup."}
{"text":"I ordered this once as delivery. Looking at their menu, I thought they were not competing on price, they must be competing on quality. I realize what they are really doing is offering unusual sushi. I ordered spring rolls, sushi pizza, green dragon roll, sushi sliders and a kimchi/beef roll. (two very adventurous choices and two sushi choices, while non-traditional but more common sushi choices) 

I had no idea what to expect with sushi sliders - they are blocks of rice with a wedge of salmon inside. Unusual but not bad. The Kimchi roll was a disaster, really does not taste good. While I knew this roll would have been hard to pull off, I gotta say as someone who makes his own bulgogi and homemade kimchi, both were worse than I make myself. I had to throw some of this out, which is a big minus for me. The Sushi pizza was actually very cheap at 4.50, but it wasn't covered in topping. It was cut in fours making it impossible to manipulate with chopsticks. The Green Dragon Roll and Spring Rolls were perfectly fine, and gave me hope that many of their other items might be adequate. Having to throw away sushi because I didn't like it, would be enough for this to merit one star, but I have to concede its a highly experimental roll so I knew I might not like it. I would choose someone else for either price or quality.

I would not recommend it and would not order from this place again."}
{"text":"I really liked the different unique selections of maki rolls though. Adding jalapeño and torched fish created interesting new flavours.

Ordered about 5 different maki sets. None of them really stood out to me in terms of quality. I enjoyed the experience but probably wouldn't go back again. I'd recommend others to visit at least once so they can experiment with new sushi styles as well !"}
{"text":"Service was excellent! My sister and I stopped here for a quick bite, and ended up staying for 3 hours on the patio! $10 pitchers from 3-6PM and 30% off sushi after 3PM. And if you're seeing a show in the area, you get a free appetizer! Great customizable sushi and appetizers. They also just recently got a frozen yogurt machine and their frozen yogurt is incredible!! 

Rob was our server (possibly manager), and he was really fantastic! If you're in the area, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"The manager was obnoxious. I just wanted to place my take out order and go and he kept trying to educate me about the menu AFTER I ordered... The cash girl messed up my order twice.. Obviously, this place was empty for a reason at 7 p.m. The food was not good."}
{"text":"Great food- 5 Stars!!!! We held an 'Under the Sea' themed lunch at our office and it was catered by Maki My Way. We ordered a couple platters and they were gone instantly ! We loved the customization that they offered. The platters were beautifully prepared and absolutely delicious. I have now become a sushi fan. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after the owner was giving out 10% off coupons and samples nearby. I'm so glad we did! 

Vegetarian sushi can be hit and miss, I had the veggie lover #1 and with the tofu it was delicious and filling! 

My sister had the dragon rolls and totally devoured them as well, we absolutely coming back! There are a couple of other tofu items I would love to try."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tasty.  They are on Ritual as well for quick lunch pick ups, so I haven't spent too much time chatting with anyone inside.  However, I was compelled to see what the service was like the other day for a late lunch.  I walked in and the gentleman (and I use this term appropriately, he is one) asked me if I'd been there before and what had I ordered.  He recommended the Dynamite Explosion Burrito to me.  

If you've never heard of a Sushi Burrito before, we're in the same boat! I'd never heard of this thing - so I took the plunge.  It was delicious.  Thin burrito style wrap with all the fixins.  I will be going back.

Hint - ONLY get the HALF Burrito.  I made the mistake of going full and wasn't hungry for the remainder of the day, it's a massive treat and you won't regret it.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best take out sushi I've had in the city so far. It's not expensive but it's extremely well made and very fresh even on a Sunday night of a long weekend. That's impressive. The sushi pizza, spicy ofc, was huge and so pretty! Which is what you want in sushi pizza, attractiveness. 
But really, this is my new go to! :')"}
{"text":"Finally checked out Maki My Way. What a wonderful place. The food is good and it's nice because you can either eat in or take out. I was boring and totally did not have maki my way (just got a box) but next time I will!

What makes this place truly special is the team. Rob, the owner is such a lovely guy and his  crew is all about customer service. They are happy maki-ying it. Ha. Ok, I laughed at my own joke.

But in all seriousness, here are the deets:

1) Very well priced
2) Chicken Karaage is awesome
3) Spicy Edamame, not sure is my thing but it's got some dry heat
4) Sushi is great
5) Make sure to nab a free sample of their original sushi rolls!
6) Frozen yogurt, my fav is the \"tart\" flavour. It tastes like pear... The green tea was underwhelming
7) Kimchi was great, but only if you like it on the more sour side
8) They do offer low sodium soy sauce
9) ... Ok... That's all I got.

Happy rolling! The sushi kind..."}
{"text":"We ordered a $16 sushi burrito here, after the nice manager (?) who always offers you to try a sample outside daily with a kind smile on his face, can't help but try this restaurant out.

It was a giant sushi burrito, bigger than the ones you see at supermarkets. Still a bit pricy for lunch.

Taste was good, although it turned sloppy really quickly."}
{"text":"The food was quite good. We had spicy salmon rolls and vegetarian roll#2. The service was polite and prompt. The owner even came to talk to us to see how we were doing. Our questions about the menu and requests were answered with a smile on the face of the server. Would recommend for a quick meal with pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Visited Maki My Way from being near the area. Once we entered, we were greeted by a really nice staff member who asked us if we were dining in or just ordering. The layout of the place is a little different, you would assume that you would be ordering up front and then having optional seats for you to sit in the front, so the layout of the place IS a little different, but the staff member made it pretty clear to us.

I've never had service as good as this place, but then again, we were the only ones in the store on a Sunday for lunch, other people who came in either got a foodora order or wanted take out. 

Their sushi burrito's range from $8-$12 for half and $14-$18 for a full size - which is normal priced, I'd say for a sushi burrito in Toronto. Coming from uptown, these are actually quite expensive prices in my opinion.

We decided to order a small platter $28.95. It had 28 pcs total, 24 pcs of maki and 4 pcs of nigiri. We got the chef's recommendation which included Crunch, 8 pcs Dynamite, 8 pcs California, 4 pcs Assorted Nigiri. The staff asked if she could get us anything to drink, like an appetizer or a drink, and we were pretty silly to think that these were included cause it was a dine in, and the prices were actually decently expensive, so we got two teas, thinking they were complementary. But, they were actually an additional $1.75 on top. The plating of the portions came in reusable containers, so it wasn't anything too special, and the staff apologized for the \"weirdness\" of the containers.

Weird plates, extra charges, okay. My fault, I didn't read properly. But I have to say, the sushi that came in really wasn't that great. It was a very Westernized style of sushi. The rice was a little soggy in my opinion, the tempura was soft and soggy, no crunch, the rolls were decently sized, but it wasn't anything more than something you can get at t&t or foodymart supermarkets uptown for $10 on sale price. For $40, this was completely not worth it in my opinion, of course other people may say otherwise and I would actually rate this a 1 star restaurant at first, but the staff really made it a little better.

From her great service, I decided to tip her as well, but I really hope this place would consider just having the seats there with no dine in option if their containers and everything used are sort of take-out styled."}
{"text":"Okay place, we just went in, because we wanted something quick before going to the theatre. Otherwise, we would've went to a pub or restaurant. Sushi about $7, and snacks $3-5.

I got the sushi pizza ($4.50 after tax) and it was a fried rice cake with salmon and avocado with some drizzle sauce on top. Nice presentation and was crispy, though the salmon doesn't look very fresh....

Friendly owner, and I can tell that the place is new- the staff wasn't sure of what they were doing.

Don't think i'm coming again, many more restaurants out there to try"}
{"text":"Maki My Way replaced the old Jugo Juice place. I ordered the Spicy Salmon Crunch Burrito and the chicken karage. 

The chicken karage was horrible. Way overcooked (tasted like it was microwaved) and not fresh at all. Pretty hard to screw up deep fried chicken, so I would recommend staying away from ordering that. 

The Spicy salmon crunch burrito was quite good though. Pretty thick, so even with that one roll was quite filling. And if you use Ritual to place your order through the phone app, you get around a $5 discount (full roll was only $11.20). Too bad this is only a one-time special offer with Ritual, as for that price, I would consider coming here more often to order that (not the chicken karage though)!"}
{"text":"This place creates very delicious and fast sushi. They are very sweet and attentive. They will even make certain substitutions if you ask! Definitely recommend for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"I had such a pleasant experience here. I had visited last year for sushi and seaweed salad a couple of times, so today wasn't my first time visiting. It tasted just as good as I remember it being, so I'd consider this place extremely consistent and delicious. I hadn't gone back because I started working in a different area downtown and have a long commute back home everyday. Today I was able to go back and got half a sushi burrito - somewhat customized it my way (got it with brown rice and nori instead of soya wrap) It was loaded with so many ingredients and tasted extremely fresh. Definitely better than any other sushi burrito I've had in Toronto -  as they are generous with how much they stuff it, and allow you to substitute ingredients. I sat outside on their small (very cute) patio and got free edemame too. Overall the customer service was phenomenal, really friendly staff - it honestly changed my mood after a long day. Next time I really want to try their steamed bao sandwich :)"}
{"text":"This place has the freshest salmon sashimi! It's buttery and melt in your mouth in texture with all the healthy fish oils. The maki rolls are good as well (although I find them a little pricy, but I suppose they are similarly priced and good quality compared to the ones you get in the supermarket). I particularly like the spicy salmon. The chicken karage is also good. They have great sauces such as the spicy mayonnaise. 

I have tried their salad and also their miso soup and wasn't enormously impressed, however I'm not a miso soup person in general.

The service here is pretty polite and professional which is one of the reasons I come back again. You can have takeout here or dine in."}
{"text":"Came here during a weekend afternoon. I used the Ritual app as part of Food is King promotion and ordered the dynamite roll and spicy salmon crunch. I got it for takeout and it was prepared fresh and very quickly that I was able to pick it up right away after I arrived at the restaurant. They have a nice restaurant located right across from the Bell TIFF Lightbox. It's not a very huge restaurant with somewhat limited seating. I got this Ritual order as a takeout. For the two dishes, they were about $15 or so and with the discount, it was basically a free meal for me. I have to say, I thoroughly enjoy the sushi. Very delicious and nicely prepared and seasoned. I like how they include these small plastic cups to put your soy sauce in- prettycool. Although, it is a la carte restaurant, the prices are pretty reasonable and fair especially for a restaurant located on King West. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience and would be more than happy to come back and try of their sushi and other menu items."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great friendly service, super clean, and its so nice to be able to make your own rolls. I also had a great time here for a Yelp event a couple of months ago. It was fun putting together what some may consider wacky combinations.

The BF and I frequently get take out from here for those nights where we can't decide what to cook. Our faves are the dynamite, green dragon, and our own concoction with avocado, lettuce, and salmon. It's also licensed, so when you dine in, you can enjoy sake and other beverages of the like.

A solid choice for sushi in the King West area. Yay Maki My Way!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Rosemont several months for work and ate here a bunch. Great option for a grab and go situation. LOVE their sushi burritos! Great prices for good quantity of food too. Super friendly staff. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This place is really underrated. The prices are very fair and the sushi is great. Also there is no wait during lunch hour which is great."}
{"text":"This place is gonna keep me coming several times for sure!!! Staff and manager are super friendly, you can see the managers passion when he gives out samples outside the restaurant, all super yummy. I like to get my meals from happy people who enjoy cooking for customets and this place is sure one of them. I have been passing by it several times and finally got my lunch from them, boy that was a delight!!! I had chicken karage and dynamite roll for lunch, they were extremely delicious!!! The sauce for chicken karage is very yummy. Dynamite roll is fresh and crunchy with shrimp. Both are highly recommended, looking forward to my next time there :))"}
{"text":"If you couldn't gather by the name of the restaurant, you may choose the ingredients you will receive in your sushi rolls at Maki My Way, which includes the meat, toppings, sauce, and veggies. This sounds interesting in theory, but the ingredients tend to stay pretty safe (crab, chicken, masago, celery, shoyu, and so on and so on). There are random options, like mango, for example. What exactly would mango pair with?

But to each their own. When my girlfriend and I eat sushi, we usually order quite a high volume. That being said, we went with a medium platter where you get five rolls and eight pieces of nigiri. When we asked if the platter included the create-your-own option (since they also have pre-made rolls you can choose from), the kid taking our order become befoozled and had to check with the manager. Are we the first ones to have ever asked that...? The manager complied with our wish, and on we proceeded. I don't even remember what I ordered now because it just tasted like a pretty generic California roll.

Many other Yelpers seem to be raving about the fantastic service here, including those with recent reviews. We must have been dining in when someone called in sick or something and pissed everyone off, because it was slow and most of the staff seemed agitated. We sat at a dirty table (since there were no vacant clean options) and waited. The food seemed to be brought out relatively quick, although I had to go up and ask for waters more than once. The actual construction of the sushi was sloppy, and kept falling apart when I attempted to pick up the pieces. The rainbow roll was particularly cumbersome, as the fish topping the rolls kept slithering off. Quality was average.

The sushi was originally brought out on this enormous tray. When we couldn't quite finish the food, I went up to ask for a little container. She literally wouldn't give me one, only offering a big, plastic lid to snap over our platter. There were little containers all over the counter, so what the hell? What was she expecting us to do, carry that giant ass platter on the subway  and bus for the 45-minute ride back to the hotel?

The concept is interesting, but it's totally not that fun. If you're considering here for a date, try making your own sushi at home. It'll be more fun that way, and you can have fun destroying your own sushi rolls together, laughing it off. Plus making out is more acceptable at home than in public and you can't really even go to first base in public without at least getting stared at."}
{"text":"I'm pretty impressed with this concept - sushi done YOUR way!  Awesome!  You can customize it with the many many choices they have - if it seems overwhelming ask the staff for help with what goes well with other ingredients.  They are there to help!  

Everything I had was fresh.  Was it the best ever - no.  But it was pretty good. I always find it hard to rate these types of places because if something doesn't taste good..well since you created it..whose fault is it??

The servers were all friendly and made recommendations to me when I couldn't decide on what to put in my sushi.  

They have sake, beer and wine here as well.  The place is small, but bright.  I would probably do a sushi drive by and take out instead of stay.  If I am ever in the area and need a quick bite I will definitely stop by.  Love the concept - so unique - why shouldn't you get what you want in your sushi?!"}
{"text":"Dont get the eel supreme. It is just cheese wrapped inside rice and seaweed, there is just a bit of eel skin."}
{"text":"I love customizing my rolls! It's certainly a novel experience and I was pleased with how good the food is. 

The staff are SUPER FRIENDLY. ALL of them. Easily the best service I've received at a sushi restaurant. I'll come back just for the service!"}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of friends on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is very clean and has a nice ambiance. The ordering process is very easy. So you can either get swift takeout or just dine in. 

What is unique about this sushi joint is that you can customize your maki. I opted to try that and it was quite fun to choose ingredients and build my own roll. They make it pretty straightforward by giving you a piece of paper which states all the options very clearly. I also ordered their Chicken Karaage appetizer. It came with a garnish of green onions and garlic mayo sauce which had a sweet hint to it. I really liked this! The chicken was juicy and crispy and the sauce complemented it very well. 

The service was amazing. The owner, Rob, is very friendly and really appreciates his customers. He even gave everyone in the restaurant a few samples of other rolls to taste so we know what else they have to offer. One thing I noticed is that they serve all food in takeout containers even if you are dining in. I would love to get the food in real plates as it is more eco friendly. It is however really convenient if you can't finish your meal and want to take the leftovers home.

Overall we had a great experience. This place offers affordable sushi and I will definitely be back to try some more!"}
{"text":"Great food 
Great Service, everbody was nice and food delivered
Prices are good 
It si a good option of you want something fast"}
{"text":"Just picked up lunch. Only one other customer in the place. Three employees plus the owner in attendance and still, my order was incorrect. The ingredients used weren't delicious at all so I'm thinking these are not people who enjoy, you know, food. Or life. I dunno, something's off here. Do yourselves a favor and walk on by. Even grocery store sushi tastes better. I mean really, do you want a free sample of raw fish from a guy holding a tray on a sidewalk? 

On the plus side, I came here when it first opened and chatted with the owner. He was full of enthusiasm and hope then... Presentation was fine. Service was fast and courteous, if not the sharpest. Other than my incorrect order and missing items. Plus the fish portions weren't microscopic. So they have that going for them."}
{"text":"This is a great place on the Restaurant Row, you know that stretch of King St. where every 2 steps someone is shoving a menu in your face.  I know, I know, competition is tough, but so is in Rue De Boulangerie in Bruxelles and over there they have the good sense to offer some freebie drinks to lure you in. 

Maki my way's claim to fame is 'make your own maki roll' - somewhat like pizza, choosing your own ingredients from a list of 'toppings.'  I didn't have the patience for that though, so just ordered their Shrimp Bento Box which was excellent, even though the teriyaki sauce over the shrimp was the regular average variety that you find all over the place in Toronto (why can't I find the pungent teriyaki sauce I had in Tokyo?).

Ingredients were fresh, sushi was good, and there were more than 3 shrimp, unlike in some other places.  Overall a good, fast lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"In the area and had a craving for sushi.  Signs out front promised so many choices which what looked like very good pricing.  This restaurant seems to do quite a bit of take - out but there are several tables inside as well as a small patio. Ordered at the counter and told my food would be brought out to me.  I ordered Dynamite rolls (8)for $8.50, Spring rolls (2) for $2.50 and Gyoza beef dumplings (4) for $4.50.
Quick service and everything was brought out at once. 
Should have realized by the pricing but actually thought the food would be regular size. Rather surprised to see all the items were all somewhat miniature.  
The dumplings were flavorful and so were the spring rolls but unfortunately the Dynamite rolls were not well made and each one completely fell apart when I picked up to eat!  Also, they did not have the Dynamite flavor I'm use to so rather dissapointing. 
They do serve beer so not too bad in the beverage department.  Most likely will not return unless I am out with a very, very small appetite!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff with delicious samples convinced me to forgo a street hotdog and pop in for lunch. Fast, good prices and yummy. And you can customize your own rooms."}
{"text":"Lunch at Maki my Way was a great experience.  It was perfect for Saturday lunch with Friends.  I had the Chicken Teriyaki Bento box and a selection of sushi which was so good:-).  Another plus was the great atmosphere created by the Owner and the staff.

Fabulous time!!  I'll be back:-)"}
{"text":"Hmm.. I never write reviews on here, but I felt I had to with this place.

First of all, it was expensive for the quantity that they give you. If the food was actually good and they had the atmosphere to match it would've made more sense to me. That was not the case - the restaurant was basic and to be honest, pretty run down for a restaurant on King West I'd expected better. The staff was rude with answering any questions and when the food came the ingredients were old and tasted like MOLD. I didn't even finish it before the waitress took it away and didn't think twice to ask why I left it (most staff will ask if you enjoyed the food at a good quality place - not here!) 

I would never go back here or recommend it to anyone in the area AND I agree with the post about food poisoning I was sick for two days after eating here!!! YUCK, disgusting. :("}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner with a friend. We were greeted and seated instantly, our server was patient with us, as our friend was still walking from where he had park. The location itself is pretty small, super busy, it gets hectic very quick. Our food came out fast, our water refilled instantly without having to ask. We ordered apps and a platter. The sushi was delicious, I loved it. The apps on the other hand, not so much. But overall, I would come back for more. It is an unfortunate, the unit is so tiny. The place is popping."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try Maki My Way, the owner was very nice in delivering sushi to our workplace. You can customize your own maki! It's a great little spot on King street. Make sure you try out the steam baos!"}
{"text":"Got some food through uber eats :). The price is not bad at all, it would be more affordable when walking in definitely. But the value is good and the quality is good as well."}
{"text":"Friendly face and free samples got our attention road-side. The food is fresh, and delicious! We jumped in, and started eating so quickly before we realized we'd better take pictures of this deliciousness! 6 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer- Vegetarian

That veggie lover #2 though. Despite the lack of creativity in the name, it was really yummy and quite filling. Lettuce is an interesting choice to put in a sushi, gives it a slight fast-food burger kind of flavour, which is hit and miss. Personally I really liked it. I also had the veggie dumpings, but for four bucks they should give you more than just 4. Stick to China Town for your dumplings. 

According to my partner - avoid the Chick'n Lick'n. It was gross and actually tasted like a bland Tim Horton's sandwich. He really enjoyed the Dragon Explosion on the other hand. 

Atmosphere- a lot more low key than expected considering the area. 

Service- Really sweet and friendly staff. 

Also we went on a Thursday and had the $12 pitcher of Sapporo! Great deal, and only very slightly watered down."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick lunch after the show.  When we first walked in, the waiter was very friendly and greet us and explain their menu and what they have to offer.  They also provide some free finger food to us which is on the house.  I ordered chrisihi bowl from their menu instead of their sushi burrito.  The chrisihi is in a small bowl of rice with sashimi on top.  The sashimi was decent but the portion is small.  Consider the location and low price, I guess it make sense.  Overall we had good experience there."}
{"text":"Small portion of bento box
Price is average but the food quality is too low. Not very fresh samon"}
{"text":"Amazing service! First time in the shop, manager explained everything about their wonderful concept. Took grab-n-go and they were 30% for end of the day special! 

Definitely going back!  #sushis"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick and healthy lunch. That is the place. They have very good quality food and service was very pleasant."}
{"text":"It's an ok place if you're in the mood for sushi and work close by or something. The prices are fine, but their food can be a little meh. I tried the tempura and the batter was spongey, not crispy at all. I had the pork belly bao, and it was really, really disappointing. I was expecting soft, thick pork belly covered in hoisin sauce, and instead got dry, room-temperature pork with some sort of ranch-like sauce and lettuce and tomato. Their actual rolls are good, not much to complain about there, but the bao was a major let down."}
{"text":"Price is ok. The sushi were average. 
Feels like a take out place but they do have some dine in area for seating. Good for a quick bite place. Not good for date or if you're trying to impress someone.
Bottom line, Average price for average food and fast"}
{"text":"Went in after spending the day at Ripleys aquarium of all places. Staff was sweet and the entire place filled up after they handed out samples outside. Good sushi, fast service."}
{"text":"Very poor food quality. I could not finish my maki rolls. The food was served in plastic containers. The only good thing about this place was that the beer was perfectly cold. I'm definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Maki My Way is #1 choice out of all other establishments along restaurant row. I live across the street and despite the amazing selection in my vicinity, I've consistently chosen to go here over the course of this year.

To get the full experience, I strongly suggest customizing your sushi (or your order). On any given day I usually order the Pork Belly Yakisoba (customized with tofu and sometimes with just green onions) or get a somewhat customized Philadelphia roll on Soya wrap. The ingredients are top notch and the meals always end up satisfying.

You'll see that they take their motto seriously and they go to great lengths to reach customer satisfaction. To reinforce this great concept, they hire extremely helpful and courteous staff. Miyuki and Amanda come to mind but all of them definitely go the extra mile. Even the kitchen staff are very friendly!

I've been to this place so much that they've gotten used to my custom orders. It's quite awesome!"}
{"text":"Maki my way is a true gem for controlling, picky eaters like myself. You are able to choose what is in your roll, how it is wrapped and what to put on top.  

I ordered 2 custom rolls. One had crab, pineapple and avocado wrapped in soya paper and tipped with spicy mayo. The other had tempura shrimp,  cucumber and avocado wrapped in soya paper and topper with Japanese mayo. I also ordered the chicken bao trio and the chicken soba noodle bowl.

All were amazing! The ingredients were fresh and delicious and it was so fun having a hand in creating my own Maki!"}
{"text":"Came here on a hot day. I found this place through Instagram. Was really into trying sushi burritos and saw that they have it! I bought a full super salmon crunch burrito to share with the boyfriend. We sat down and I checked in on Yelp and it said free bottled water or appetizer. The service was incredible. The server gave us TWO free bottles of water and an appetizer (edamame). The sushi burrito was super good as well. I was very, very satisfied. When we were done, the server came with two sample sizes frozen yogurts for us to try because it was hot. They also ask you if you want low sodium soy sauce or regular. I could not be happier with this place. They even gave me free easy to use children's chopsticks in case I had any children in the household!! WOULD COME AGAIN WITHOUT A DOUBT!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I had in a long time. very friendly and fast stuff. patio outside! you can customize your sushi but you don't have to ;) summed up 5 stars"}
{"text":"I want to start off with the cons of this place because just thinking about my experience here still baffles me. To give you some background, we ordered the medium platter to share, as the small didn't seem like it would be enough for two starvin' marvins. The platter is the equivalent of 5 rolls, which is about 40 pieces of sushi, along with 8 pieces of nigiri. 

We finished most of the sushi, but had some stragglers left and wanted to take them home. They give you the platter on a pretty large take-away container. Well, since there were only about 5 pieces left at the end, my boyfriend went up to the counter to ask for a smaller container. The chick had the nerve to say that they didn't have anymore smaller containers (which was obviously false because they were still preparing food on the smaller ones), but she could give us the top of the platter. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? This is a giant platter with a few measly pieces of sushi left, and you want me to take this gigantic container home on public transit? SCREW THAT. 

So I asked a different chick and she happily got the smaller container for me. I have no idea what the other chick's deal was, but she must have been pissed at us for no reason. She was the one who took our order, and she didn't seem very friendly to begin with, so that was probably the problem. 

Regardless, the sushi took a long time to prepare and then when we received it, we didn't have any utensils. We had to yet again ask another employee for chopsticks and napkins. We also ordered water, but my boyfriend had to go up and get it from them. It was just a customer service nightmare. 

The sushi wasn't even good enough to warrant such terrible service. The employees were obviously extremely lazy and could have cared less about our patronage. But don't worry, we will never step foot in here again. 

I saw someone drop sushi onto the floor, and they actually considered picking it up and putting it back into the pile. But they eventually walked away and threw it away. Though it actually had me unnerved for a second since there was even a second thought about not throwing it away. It shouldn't have taken 30 seconds to decide. I encourage you to count to 30 Mississippis and see if that's too long.  

Another container had also fallen on the floor with it, but did not break open. He just jostled it and then put it back into the pile. SO BEWARE, if you get any deliveries from this place. Your sushi may have been on the floor at some point. I can only assume that he thought that no one was paying attention for the reason why he thought it was okay to pick up food off the floor.

Not to mention, the cleanliness of this place was zilch. The tables were dirty. The restrooms were ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. There was toilet paper all over the floors and literal piss and shit all over the actual toilets. I wanted to hurl. I ended up using the employees' only restroom because it was the only one that was somewhat touchable. OF COURSE their own bathroom is the only usable one.

If their restrooms are in this much disrepair, can you imagine them actually washing their hands? EW! I would give this place ZERO stars, if I could. I highly suggest avoiding this place at all costs.

Overall: 1/5
Food: 1/5
Service: 1/5
Atmosphere: 1/5"}
{"text":"Free portable chopsticks if you went in during opening season!

Environment feels like a fast food chain where you can customize your sushi. Prices are quite average, not cheap but definitely not expensive. They also have a selection of premade sushi to grab and go.

Would I go again? Most likely not. I feel like if the prices dropped an average of 10-20% or so, it would be more in line with its offerings."}
{"text":"3.5* A primarily takeout sushi place with a small element where you can build your own roll(s), hence the name, \"Maki My Way\"!  

Located right across the street from the TIFF Lightbox, MMW is ideal for the theatre-goer crowd + takeout for people living in the area.

Highlights:  Salmon/Avo roll (built) with masago.  I believe it was $7.50-8.00, but it was nice and fresh.  It was also nice that you can make anything a combo (either salad OR soup + a drink, including green tea) for an additional $2.99.  

I met one of the owners who looked like George Lopez and he was really nice.

Skip:  Soy sauce-based dressing for salad was waaay too salty, so don't pour the whole thing on.  

And is yakisoba Japanese for instant noodles?  Skip this offering as well as that's what it tasted like with the msg-flavouring to boot.  I wasn't too fond of the seasoning that was used.  

Dine-in also came in takeout containers.  :(  I wished that it was something more environmental.

Don't get confused like I did, just order your rolls and if you don't find anything on the menu you like, THEN build your own roll."}
{"text":"I liked that you can customize your rolls, and it's quite affordable considering the area. The roll was good too, but the soy wrapper keep falling off. My friend got a bento box but I don't think it was worth it. He mentioned the beef + rice were undercooked. 

One thing I have to say is that there were too many flies in the restaurant.... Seriously, we spent more time avoiding the flies than eating our food. The tables were dirty and not clean either."}
{"text":"Fabulous concept, fantastic experience! This  bright, contemporary new spot at King and John gives passers by a fast, but healthy and affordable food option that was really needed on King. It gives the subway treatment to sushi - customize what you want in your roll, and surprisingly, the customization doesn't come at a greater cost. Great for vegetarians, vegans or anyone with dietary restrictions, who (if you're like me), doesn't want to be \"that guy\" bugging the staff about every ingredient. But also great if you're bad at choices - they have a pre-fixed menu as well.

The fish itself is really fresh and my 8 piece roll was just enough to comfortably fill me without that sushi bloat (you know it). Also try the chicken balls with the spicy mayo dip. All this with a drink came to under 20 bucks. Can't wait till this place is on just-eat #dangerous"}
{"text":"I love this place! They are one of a kind since you get to create your own roll. The portions are very generous and delicious. The owners and staff are very friendly and will go out of their way to please you. Great place to stop for dinner before a show, for lunch, or anytime to satisfy your cravings for amazing sushi."}
{"text":"Kind of a weird place. Nice and big but at 1:20 PM on a Thursday, no customers. Nice servers. 

Ordered Bao buns (3) but only gave me a choice of all the same ( chicken, pork, beef) Had Chicken Karage.  3 too thick Bao buns, each with a tomato, lettuce and a deep friend (small) piece of chicken) - 

Price with tea - $13.45 - a bit much considering the small amount of ingredients. 

Suggestion.  - order from your baker, thinner buns, and add more ingredients - not just one chunk of chicken but maybe a couple of pieces.  

I went away hungry and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst sushi i have ever had - and i'm not very picky about sushi. I mean how could you make bad sushi? The rice was bland, the fish had no taste, and all you could really taste was avocado. An average roll cost $10+tax - not worth it for the quality of sushi you're getting. However, the eel tasted good - but $4 for ONE hand roll is overpriced. I would not come back here and would definitely not recommend it - especially since there are plenty of other much tastier sushi places around."}
{"text":"This place is crazy cute and adorable & pretty spacious. The owner is super friendly & the employees will literally bend over backwards to satisfy a customer. For the most part, it's pretty quiet in here 70% of the time. You can grab and go without having to wait forever. So why only 2 stars? 

Because this place is quite pricey. I ordered California roll and 12 pieces of salmon sashimi (without rice might I add) & it almost cost me $30. I realize it's downtown but damn! I might as well purchase the salmon for the price and make it myself. Or go to an all you can eat and pay that amount. Even their pre-set packages are pricey. I'm not too eager to return there anytime soon. Great service or not."}
{"text":"Last Saturday I had the pleasure of going to Maki My Way with friends. It was nice to be greeted by a friendly owner who told us why he had opened this restaurant.  This is a great place for take out or eat in quickly. It was nice to know that I could customize my sushi, my way. Although I did not opt to do this, I liked that I had that option. Another plus was that the restaurant was clean and bright, very inviting. 

I decided to order the beef steamed dumplings and the Spicy Salmon Crunch. I enjoyed both. They were delicious. I liked that I was able to get more spicy mayo, at no cost.  

I also sampled the Korean sushi, which lived up to his name and flavour. Very good! I would get this again. I also saw the Bento Boxes which looked colourful and plentiful. I would definitely try a bento box next time.

One of the best parts of the meal for me was the great customer service from the owner and wait staff. A meal can be delicious but when not accompanied with good service, the meal is just not as good for me. They made me and my guest feel at ease, at home and left me wanting to come back to try out more great items from their menu.

I wish them continued success!"}
{"text":"Cafeteria/casual dining style. I came with a friend  of mine for a quick bite before going to the movies. Great service from Lynn and Bianca on a Sat night. Food came quickly I ordered the 3 mini steamed  bao sandwiches: 2 pork belly which I found dry; & 1 ground beef (more moist). As well as 3 slices of salmon sashimi and a kimchi appetizer (very generous portion size). My appetizer was free for doing a check-in on my Yelp app (value $2.50). 
Salmon Sashimi quality seemed fine. 

Really like how they automatically give the option of regular or low sodium soy sauce. Other places you have to ask for it. Good job. 

I would go back for a quick bite. For the 2 things I ordered my total was $11-12 + tip for excellent and friendly service (my appetizer was free- use your check-in button). I was still a bit hungry though."}
{"text":"Sweet little sushi spot in the Yonge-King area (situated beside the Shoppers Drug Mart). This location is situated with a Thai Express and Villa Madina).
It's a new spot. My friend and I decided to take a short walk to this location to pick up lunch. 
We were greeted by friendly staff who explained the process. There are ready-made sushi trays for one with the option to order from the menu (sushi burritos, rolls, appetizers, etc). 
I decided to order from the menu with a dragon roll and picked up a small salad. 
The woman and gentleman behind the counter were quite nice. I thought it was nice of them to give us complimentary reusable chopsticks. I chose a pair with a cute elephant motif. It made my day! 
The sushi roll - it was fresh and flavorful. I was impressed with a \"fast food\" type outlet that the fish was very good quality. 
I didn't mind the walk to this location. Looks like I've found a new quick grab sushi spot."}
{"text":"Amazing service and really good food. The staff was really attentive and made sure that we all got exactly what we wanted."}
{"text":"First of ALL the staff is super friendly..

Second the moment you check in you get a free appetizer... I picked spring rolls!

Third Bento Box is supper delicious with a choice of salmon,pork,chicken,or shrimp on rice, California rolls, salad, dumplings, and miso soup...omg filling and delicious with miso soup on side!! Oh I already mentioned that :-D super flavourful and yummy!!

All for $14.00 after tax now we're talkin!! Bon-appetite!!!"}
{"text":"The quality is very good and I don't have to worry about the fish not being fresh.  The customer service is superb, and the owner (I assume) was super friendly and you can tell he is very passionate about what he does.   I hope to see more variety for the make-your-own in the future which I'm sure is already on its way."}
{"text":"Oh, Maki My Way, you have maki to my heart!  Custom made sushi roll is a fantastic concept.  I was feeling adventurous and ordered tempura shrimp, kimchi, and snow pea sprouts, with masago and spicy mayo in soya wrap.  The order came in seaweed wrap instead, but the combo was still delicious.   I also tried another custom roll of eel, avocado, and asparagus.  This one was a great combo as well.  
We were a big group so I got to taste a bunch more - Red Dragon Roll, Spicy Salmon Crunch, Philadelphia Roll (the cream cheese overpowered other ingredients), Oh Canada Roll (I didn't notice the maple syrup taste), Veggie Roll, Seared Salmon Roll, Salmon Sushi Sliders (too much rice), Pork Belly Bao Sandwich (there was mustard which I didn't like) , Pork Katsu, Chicken Karage (white meat), and Sake.  Maki My Way made their own sake, it was very smooth and sweet, perfect to my taste.
All the ingredients tasted fresh, the food was great, and the varieties of hot and cold food were amazing options for everybody with different cravings.
Rob, Louis, and the staff were super friendly and helpful.  It was a busy night and they still served everyone attentively with great smiles.  Our group had a fantastic time.  I can't wait to come back and create my own maki again!"}
{"text":"The sushi burrito was one of the better ones I've had.  The size of the burrito was Chipotle-esque.  The price is a little on the higher side, but you get what you pay for.  In a burrito, you get an ample amount of everything (even fish).  Each sushi burrito is made up of rice, raw fish, crabmeat, lettuce, cabbage, and a house sauce (~spicy mayo).  They keep the rice at a minimum too, which I'm sure many of us can appreciate.  Their sushi looked only okay; they are pre-packaged like the ones in the supermarket.  If you're just stopping by, you'll want to just order the sushi burrito; I was pretty full after eating just that.  

The place itself is pretty cool.  The inside is mostly modern with brick walls for an urban touch.  Also, I'm a fan of the clever name.  

Check it out if you're in the city and craving sushi for the day!"}
{"text":"Cheapish AYCE place downtown. Not the most amazing sushi but it is really good for an all you can eat place and it is downtown and not that expensive so if you want to push it to the limit without emptying your pockets, this might just be the right stop for you."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! A nice hole in the wall place next to the hipster places and wow, if you want some great sushi, this is a great place to stop in. Friendly staff. Good selection and everything I had was excellent. A salmon bento box and crunchy salmon rolls. Yum. I will definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in starving for a snack and had the best meal. Amazing service, great sushi and clean."}
{"text":"Average takeout sushi joint in a convenient location. I haven't eaten here during peak business hours but I tend to check out their end of the day sales where it's possible to score an 8 roll set for ~$5. I wouldn't go for the raw fish during this time but the Rockin' California Roll is decent - it has all your typical ingredients plus tempura bits and spicy mayo. The rolls are pretty mediocre in quality but for that price and size, I'm ok with that. An affordable post-work snack."}
{"text":"Five stars for quality and tasty food; for excellent customer service by owner and employees; for environment. For overall experience! Everything!!

I came by here yesterday as I was walking the street and I was impressed! I was just looking at the menu outside and the wonderful owner approached me & asked if we'd like to try a sample. I never see sushi restaurants giving out samples! 

We then decided we were going to dine in there. They have a cute little patio, but kind of got windy. It'll be great for when summer weather comes! There's alcohol on the menu. You can create your own sushi rolls, and it's not overpriced like many other sushi restaurants. The special rolls are different. Not any you've seen at other sushi places. 

** chicken kaarage is a must ! 

This might just be my go-to spot when I'm craving some sushi. Highly highly recommend. 
Will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to get some take-out sushi, basically because there was a sign saying everything was 50% discounted as it had just turned 5pm.

The regular menu has the novelty of allowing you to create your own sushi rolls - you pick the ingredients.

Other than that novelty, this place is your completely average downtown business-district sushi-joint. I ordered a couple of the pre-made trays to go, they were assembled nice but I would have never paid the regular price for them. More of a lunch spot than a good spot to have dinner."}
{"text":"The whole point here is that you can make your own sushi! That means endless possibilities! The rolls start from $7.50, and depending on how balling you want your roll, it can get a bit pricier. I find with sushi, I love salmon, tuna, avocado and shrimp tempura. Not exactly an adventurer here, so I tried the Green Dragon - delicious! They also have a funky little \"Oh Canada' roll that includes cheese, bacon and just general goodness. The rolls were freshly made, and ingredients were fresh too!

The star of this all, though, is the Chicken Karage ($4.50). Now THAT is DELICIOUS! Crispy fried chicken bites that comes with a bit of salad sauce. Let me tell you, each bite is juicy, tender chicken breast, and fried perfectly. SO GOOD! 

They also serve Sake, Sapporo on tap and a variety of wines and beers. Not bad at all for a little sushi place!

The owner also let us know that they are looking at getting a frozen yogurt machine soon, so expect to see green tea froyo in the near future. I would come again and again!"}
{"text":"This place has funky neon decor and upbeat staff. Definitely unusual for a sushi restaurant. Their claim to fame is that you can choose the ingredients that go in your sushi. They have a pretty extensive list... everything from asparagus to lettuce to pineapple, if that's your thing.
The service is what stands out though. They're very friendly here, and even the people at the back making the sushi were all smiles. It's above and beyond for what seems to be a mostly take-out joint.
I ordered the Spicy Salmon Crunch, which is apparently their most popular item. They give you an actual cut of fresh salmon in the roll, rather than the minced up leftover scraps that most sushi places offer. As good as it gets, indeed!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, more than a few actually- and it has been more disappointing than not. I have had more than 5-10 times where ingredients I am allergic to and warned of on the order, were included in my roll. The same ingredient was actually included on the replacement roll once. Some ingredients that are extra in rolls, have been flat out forgotten, along with soy sauce...  I wouldn't recommend this place if you want a good sushi experience. It is a fast-food version, for on the go, or settling for quality. I never post on here, I think it's silly, but this is the 1000th time I've been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Loved the fact that I could customize my roll.  Fish was fresh.  Owner was very friendly."}
{"text":"I had some sushi platter here when I did TIFF volunteer last year. The food was okay but they did it really quick. Good place to grab sth to eat"}
{"text":"Great hospitality! Hosted my group of 12 and made sure everyone had exactly what we needed! Owner is super sweet! Food was amazing AND they have sushi burritos! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"best sushi ever! i usually don't go for the chef's choice/platter because you end up getting the worst sushi pieces but at Maki My Way i keep ordering the chef's choice! amazing taste & good size sushi pieces, i love this place!! i often order delivery :)"}
{"text":"Myself and two colleagues were craving sushi and followed Yelpers and tried this place. From the outside we thought it was going to be disappointing because it looks like a fast food cafe. We were wrong! We had a variety of items: Dynamite, Dynamite Explosion, Red Dragon, Green Dragon, Spicy Salmon and all were yummy. The manager also gave us a few samples of appetizers which was really nice. The sushi was fresh, portions were large, and the flavors were yummy."}
{"text":"Maki My Way is a casual sushi restaurant on King St W. They specialize in offering a customized sushi experience by allowing customers to build their own sushi rolls from a selection of fresh ingredients. It's definitely a unique approach to sushi. I have been a customer of Maki My Way for over a year now since finding them as an option on Just-Eat, and I am impressed by their consistency. 

Sushi: They have a variety of sushi available like maki, hand rolls, and sashimi. However, their signature item is the customized rolls, where the combination possibilities are plenty. 

Bento Box: The bento boxes are generously portioned with the meat of choice, 2 dumpling, veggies, and seaweed salad. I usually get the teriyaki beef, and I liked that it comes with seaweed salad instead of the usual green salad. 

Sushi Pizza (spicy): What a deal for only $4.95. The sushi pizza is topped with a generous amount of salmon, and tastes great! I usually get this as my choice of appetizer, but the chicken karage are pretty good too. 

Maki My Way may not be for everyone, as they don't offer the usual Japanese dining experience. Instead, they use disposable plastic containers to provide a more casual dining experience. However, they do have plates on hand if you request it. Eating here is meant to be fast, and casual!! I also liked that they give you the option to choose from low sodium or regular soy sauce.

Customer service has always been friendly, attentive, and quick. Overall, it's a solid lunch or dinner option on King St, and conveniently across from the TIFF Lightbox."}
{"text":"It's a solid sushi place with a very convenient location on King Street West.  The service is what makes this place what it is and the people who work here are extremely friendly.  Maki My Way is meant for quick and efficient consumption if you are quickly on the go in my opinion and it is solid.  

Used Ritual to order the Spicy Salmon Crunch Roll (8pcs) and the Korean Roll (8pcs).  The spicy salmon crunch roll was alright, nothing special and just the traditional roll you would find anywhere.  The Korean Roll was a bit more unique as it consisted of beef and kim chi to create a different type of taste.  I was expecting more from both rolls I bought, in taste and fulfillment factors.  

All in all, the staff are wonderful and are extremely friendly.  Whilst, the food just makes you seem like you're missing something. Nothing special, small portion sizes with prices that don't match and quality that turns you towards another establishment."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan! The food was great (and filling), the staff and the owner were very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant is unique in that you can create your own rolls, as it was my first time eating at this restaurant I decided to stick with what I know. I ordered the chicken bento box (boring I know) which consisted of miso soup, California rolls, spring rolls, rice, chicken and a small salad. The food was nicely seasoned and the rolls tasted fresh. I look forward to coming back and building my own roll. For the price, and for the quality of food you receive I would recommend anyone to check this place out."}
{"text":"I just finished watching Captain America (civil war) and wanted to grab a bite. I came upon this place as Yelp hosted an event here a few months ago. 

They have their 50% off closing sale towards he end of the day which was a great incentive for me to try out. 

I must say, the service and friendly hospitality is the best part. Rob (manager) is a great guy who really tries to serve his customers. The couple next to me wanted sushi rolls with no rice and Rob instantly worked with the client and kitchen to make this happen. He is really dedicated to his work and the business. 

I had some mixed salmon/tuna/avocado rolls and they tasted great (my benchmark are other take out sushi places). Good assortment and variety- lots of mixing and matching. 

Their menu has different assortments of teriyaki bowls, bentos - I will be back to check that out. 

Best part - check in on Yelp to get miso soup/salad/appetizer/drink. Now that's value."}
{"text":"The stuff was nice and the food tasted average BUT their appetizer salad was not fresh at all! On top of that, there were fruit flies all over the place! Would not recommend..."}
{"text":"I ordered here because of their end-of-day 30% off sales. So I bought a box of 12 pieces sushi for around 9 dollar plus tax. I grab a box for take-out to eat at home.
The sushi is just the OK quality. It is what you expect from fast food sushi place.
The sushi fell apart when I was eating.
The price is good for downtown sushi place. I would probably eat it here when I came home from work and needed something for dinner."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious sushi that I would recommend to have for lunch if you're in the area. My sister and I decided to meet here for lunch as it's in between our work place. 

Everyone was very nice, friendly, and attentive. The gentleman possibly owner provided us a sample to try before we decided to sit down. They provided us free edamame to snack on while we waited for our orders. I ordered the black dragon roll and the spicy salmon crunch roll. My sister got the california roll and a dynamite hand roll. You can also get a free small app or drink if you check in on Yelp.

Overall quick and friendly place to get some sushi."}
{"text":"I have no idea what people see in this place. Ordered it via DoorDash and nothing but disappointment.

Husband and I ordered 
2 veggie rolls (asked for no lettuce or cucumber- easy requests)
Tofu
Gyoza
1 meat roll
Spring rolls
Chicken karaage


On spring rolls, gyoza I specifically wrote please only send if vegetarian.

Food came. Super tiny portions. Wasabi smeared on rolls (eww!l)

Lettuce & cucumber inside (asked for none)

Chicken was super tiny portion for $5. Usually double size at most restaurants. Looked greasy and gross.

Bit into spring roll which had meat (been a vegetarian 10 years. Was unimpressed)

Food was gross.

How does it have such positive reviews on here???"}
{"text":"Maki My Way is a great place to stop and grab sushi. It has reasonable prices and the owner is a fantastic guy. We stopped here to get light sushi while visiting Toronto and thought it was just as good as what we've had in other locations! If you want to stop and grab quick, cheap, good sushi this is the place."}
{"text":"Not the most fresh fish. Serviceable for a quick lunch but I'll never crave anything from this place."}
