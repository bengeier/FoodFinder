{"text":"I ordered a 2x2 (pork ribs and brisket) with Smoakie Beans and Corn Bread. As soon as I got my plate I knew I would be disappointed just based on the portions. 2 small ribs, 4 slices of brisket that was mainly fat, and beans. I told the cashier that they forgot my corn bread and he said it didn't come with my meal but he would give it to me for free. I reminded him that I ordered it as a side and he just stayed quiet. The ribs had a good flavor but did not have a lot of meat on them like all ends of the rack. The brisket was a little dry and was mainly fat. The beans lacked flavor so I poured my bbq sauce over them, after that they were ok. The corn bread had a good flavor but was extremely dry. The atmosphere of the place was not to welcoming no greeting when you walk in the door or a \"have a nice day\" when you walk out. I don't think I'll spend my money here again unless they make some drastic changes."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive about trying this place after reading the mixed reviews, but I am sure glad I did. Staff was great, asking each what there favorites were and ordered them. Ribs were tender, meat came right off the bone; home made BBQ sauce served on the side ; large slab of juicy, tender brisket. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try Smoakie Kitchen yesterday and wanted to share my experience.  They have several options, so I chose the 2X2 offering (2 meats and 2 sides) in order to sample more items and see what I might want in the future.  A family member went with and did the same; we somewhat shared our orders in order to try things that were on 1 plate but not the other.  Although some of the items were not really to my liking, others were fantastic!  I will definitely be back.  Below are the things we tried and my feelings on them.

Fatty Brisket: To die for!  It is very fatty, but that's a big part of what keeps brisket so moist and flavorful.  The fat was easily trimmed off and the meat remaining was a very substantial portion.  It was perfect - no sauce or seasonings needed beyond what it was cooked in.

Ribs: Eh... not my favorite.  They were fairly tender but I make ribs and found them to be a bit rushed.  Parts seemed more dried out and there wasn't much flavor to write home about.  They were ok but I wouldn't personally bother with these again when I can get better ribs at home.

Hotlinks: Tasty!  These were perfectly cooked and spicy but not *too* spicy... you can handle it.  

Smoakie Beans: Phenomenal!  I could eat these by the bucket-full.The beans were prepared in a thin but very flavorful sauce, perfectly cooked.  Along with the beans, chunks of I believe every meat they serve were present, adding both flavor and substance.  These had a little spice to them (green chilies were used) but it wasn't anything crazy, so probably just about everyone would enjoy them.

Mac n' Cheese: Not bad!  Not my favorite, but they were very cheesy.  If anything, these just needed some seasoning and the noodles cooked just a bit less (they were a bit overly soft).

Cole Slaw: Good!  I've had some that were a bit better, but this is still one of the better slaws I've had.  It tasted very fresh and well-balanced.  I was missing a little brine to it that I love in a few others, but that was the only negative.  

Barbecue Sauce: Now this I have to say I really didn't like.  The basics were present in its composition but it was WAY too sweet for my liking.  If you like a very sweet barbecue, this might be for you.  That's just not me though.

So - I have a very strong preference for their brisket and smoakie beans.  I do want to try their other meats at some point, too, and might see how things like their cornbread and baked beans are, too.  However, I will definitely be back - that's not even up for debate.  :)"}
{"text":"I went to Smoakie's shortly after it opened. The Brisket had just come out. I ordered the 2x2 platter and enjoyed the pork, brisket and smoke beans. The pork was full of flavor! Unfortuantely, the greens were too salty for me to eat. I should've said something to the staff, as my latter experience proved to be helful. 

My second visit, I told them about the salty greens and they understood and advised when the sit too long they become salty. They gave me a sample of the fresh pot and they were delish. They replaced the old greens as a result of my feedback. I prefer my greens to be more spicy, but that's just what I'm used to. 

This is a new business to our area and I'm all about supporting what's in my community. I'm sure they would appreciate all feedback. 

I liked their peach cobbler...it was good! 

Service was good, staff was helful with samples."}
{"text":"I don't know where all these good reviews are coming from. I tried it twice, and it's really not good at all. The best thing on the menu are the hot links. The main knock I have on this place is the sauce I guess. Tastes like soy sauce or something. Really salty and watered down. The meat itself isn't too bad. But with that sauce, nope."}
{"text":"While I'm not a vegetarian, I don't usually eat a lot of meat. When I do, it's gotta be good, and this was. We got the 2x2 platter which is two kinds of meats (brisket and pulled pork) and two sides on a shareable platter. Super yummy. The meats are the real stars of this meal. We also got cole slaw and mac and cheese which were both very tasty. I wasn't a big fan of the peach cobbler, because I found it too sugary, but that may be just the ticket for another palate. Overall, I liked it and I'll be back."}
{"text":"We love BBQ and this (no lie) is the worst we have had.  We were so excited to see there was some where to go locally and we are so disappointed.  All the food lacked any flavor, tasted old and burnt.  The ribs were dry, brisket and chicken was moist but it doesn't matter if there is no FLAVOR. Mac and cheese was horrible and the cornbread tasted like grease.  Even the beans were bad.  I hate giving bad reviews but after losing over $30 I had to say something."}
{"text":"Some of the best  fatty-brisket my boyfriend ever had. He comes from the south and he is EXTREMELY hard to impress. The owners were really nice as well. We got there around noon and the food was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Went in about an hour before closing and the meat looked like it was made in the morning, dried out and sitting in grease. The brisket was not pink as it should be and very little smoke flavor on any of the meat. Ribs should be trimmed of the fat, way to much. They will give you free samples like all the other shops, The sauce is not sweet and very tangy but not in a good way. Price as others have said is high for what you get. So needless to say in little words, not to good. I will give it some time and try again in hopes they will see and change to what myself and others have said. We need this in our little ghetto."}
{"text":"Friendly service, guy in the kitchen had excellent hospitality, opened the oven and pulled out a fresh peach cobbler, which to my surprise was actually good! We ordered the brisket sandwiches, delicious! The BBQ was served on the side it was sweet and tangy, mid west style, just the way I like! Price wasn't bad $24 fed both of us. We will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"I came in today, got there right around 1pm.  Ordered a pound of fatty brisket, half a chicken, potato salad and mac and cheese.  

The brisket was absolutely fantastic.  Very juicy.  Chicken was fall off the bone and moist.  Sides are good, not the best mac I've ever had, but it would do if I had a craving. 

Friendly staff too.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love BBQ and was looking forward to a BBQ place closer to me. While there staff was really nice, I was disappointed with my meal. I ordered the brisket sandwich with macaroni and cheese. I liked the macaroni and cheese but did not like the brisket. My brisket sandwich was full of gristle and fat, which lead me to have to pick through my sandwich to pull out the pieces of gristle and fat. I also tried their BBQ sauce and found it very vinegary. If you're looking for great brisket, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"very good bbq. i order a rack of ribs and side of beans and greens. so much flavor in ribs and beans. just disappointed  on the sweet tea. greens are served nices and hot. again very good bbq. smoked ribs. not grilled."}
{"text":"Great BBQ sauce!! The only thing that made me give 3 stars is that every single bite from my pulled chicken sandwich I had to stop chewing to get bones out if my mouth. Literally every bite had a bone in it."}
{"text":"Oh my!! I just love this place. I had the brisket and chicken with greens and cornbread!!! The head cook john know his stuff. Everything taste just like its thanksgiving. The service was fast and courteous and the sweet tea is also very good. They are open from 9-9 I think most days. The food is super tender!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Smokie Kitchen. Arrived at noon on a Tuesday and only two other customers. Uh oh. 

I ordered the 2x2 platter. I got brisket and pork ribs with collard green plus Mac and Cheese for $16.29. 

Let's start with the service. Although it was efficient, I did not get the 'southern hospitality' that you get from all the other places. Just took my order, without comment, delivered my plate, without comment and then I left the premises, without comment.  Middle Eastern hospitality?

The food. The collard greens were very salty. They had added some pulled pork and bacon but there was no smoke at all. Just salt. Lots of salt. 
The Mac was okay. I agree with another reviewer that it was like velveeta. Decent flavor, just not home cooking. 

The pork ribs were huge. I easily pulled the meat from the bone, to facilitate saucing them. Decent flavor but, again, no smoke. The 'Fatty Brisket' was definitely not fatty. Rather overcooked and rendered to fat-less meat. Shame. 

The BBQ Sauce was interesting. I had trouble fingering what it was. It was okay, not exceptional. 

I may try Smokie Kitchen again, since it's they're open on Sunday's during football!  Probably with different selections and expectations."}
{"text":"Stopped in and got a brisket sandwich and it was very tasty! The smoke was good and the sauce was as well. The staff was friendly too! I know this place is new and getting better every day. Keep an eye out for them as I know they will become a top Laveen food destination."}
{"text":"Great place, the mac and cheese and ribs are to die for! Try the Smoakie beans, amazing! My sister tried the chicken and was in love. Will be here again soon!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money....  Overcooked, dry pulled pork which I don't think experienced a minute over a smoker.  Tough brisket that could not be touched by the cheapest plastic knives I have seen.   $18 for 2 meats and 2 sides (beans and collard greens justified the obligatory star) and a medium drink . They had one of those \"Ice Tea\" machines that produced tea of very, very diluted piss, I commented on it but no one went to replenish the Tea dust.   Whoever has gone to a BBQ place in the Dry South that did not have brewed from scratch Ice tea!!!.

Take your $$ and go to Texas BBQ House, much better and they actually allow you metal utensils and real Ice Tea!!

{"text":"Yikes!! well first let me say \"I love good BBQ\" and I love a well smoked brisket\" nothing better IMHO and this is definitely NOT the place to get either. I ordered a 2x1 with Ribs and Brisket with a side of Smoakie Beans and my wife ordered a 1/2 rack with Mac and Cheese. The brisket was cold, dry and most ended up in the bin, the 1/2 rack of ribs was 2 bones, possible a 3rd of a rack and that would be pushing it, also cold and tasted like they were cooked yesterday and warmed up, their fate was in the bin also. Mac and Cheese so bad, so hard and so dry we each had maybe a bite or two. Smoakie beans nothing more than mashed pintos with some meat tossed in, my best description refried beans with shredded meat added. My ribs were cold, hard, barely warmed up, tasteless missing any indication of a rub or seasoning and I make ribs 1000 times better at home. I thought it was odd as we waited for our order (slow) not a single thing was being cooked, except for some beans. The meat guy had piles of meat wrapped in foil stacked on top of each other grabbing ribs and such from the appropriate pile, laying them on the flat top grill, I'm assuming to rewarm them as I watched him slice COLD brisket and lay it on the grill and then into the go box. Nothing about this place is memorable in any good way and I feel bad for the guys that just got jobs at this new place because serving this kind of food, this place won't last long. Overall our $27 dinner ended up with $20 in the trash can. This place is a mile from my house and I'll never complain about having to drive the 10 miles to Texas BBQ again!!!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly counter service.

Fatty brisket was my favorite part of the meal.  The pork ribs weren't that great.  Daughter liked the cole slaw.  The corn on the cob was very watery. Corn bread was good.

Peach cobbler was super stale bread texture.

Didn't care for the drink options at all."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim. Service was exceptional, the server gave me a few samples, loved the lamb. Yes, lamb. It was tender and flavorful. I tried the beans too, pretty good.

Ended up having the 2x1 with lamb and brisket. Brisket was juicy and tender, had some fat but just the right amount for me. The lamb was the star. I'd have it everything I come in the future. Greens were fresh, didn't notice too much salt like the other reviews.

Drinks are all fountain with coke products. Agree that tea should be fresh brewed, maybe have sweet tea too would be nice. They was only one sauce. It was good. Might I suggest having more types like a good mustard based BBQ sauce.

I will be back when on this side of town."}
{"text":"First time eating here and the experience was great. I was greeted as I walked in by friendly cashier and she happily answered any questions I had. I had the brisket and bbq beans. The brisket was tender and juicy with great flavor. The beans were tasty but still a little underdone but great nonetheless. I am definitely gonna be a regular here."}
{"text":"Here's a suggestion.
Take the twenty-six dollars I just spent in your restaurant and go buy yourself a gd bbq cookbook!

Your food was so dry, salty and overall flavorless, it's hard to imagine you didn't set this place up to launder money or something because you sure-as-fuck can't cook.

In fact, if I'm not in the hospital or dead by this time tomorrow, it'll be a fucking Christmas miracle!

Holy shit, pass the tylenol!"}
{"text":"I'm really saddened to have to post this, but I am really disappointed in Smoakie's. Like, I just threw almost $26 worth of food away.
I went with my friend. When we arrived there were only 2 other customers in line. I ordered first; a 2x2 platter with ribs,  \"hot links\", mac and cheese, and Smoakie beans, and half a chicken.  My friend also ordered a 2x2 with the brisket, ribs, mac and cheese, and collard greens. 
After my friend and I ordered, two more customers came in. I received my order in a timely fashion but I began to question what my friend had ordered because the people who came in after us got their order before she did. After about 20 minutes we left. The staff was very friendly but kind of slow. 
Disclaimer: I tasted everything before adding any sauce. 
I really only got a smoked taste from the chicken. Everything else kind of tasted boiled and bland. The sauce was a sweet sauce,  a very sweet sauce. Maybe honey, but not very tasty  The hot link is pork and is very mushy on the inside with no flavor and no heat, so no bueno. The mac and cheese tasted like a mix between kraft and Velveeta with a hint of nacho cheese sauce.  The Smoakie beans have pork brisket, peppers, and onions. Now I normally don't judge food by its appearance because I've eaten a LOT different foods and some have not looked appealing but have been FANTASTIC. This was not the case with the beans. Again, very bland, the beans had no flavor. I had some of my friend's collard greens and they were salty and looked canned. They were not very good at all. The 2x2 platter is $14.99 and the half chicken was $9.99. I'm so sad because I was really excited when I saw this place open.  My 4 year old nephew wouldn't even eat it and he eats EVERYTHING. 
I gave it 2 stars because the staff was really nice but I'm pretty sure I won't be going back."}
{"text":"They have really improved. I came here when they first opened and was disappointed with everything. 
Decided to give it a second chance tonight and I am glad that I did. 
They were very friendly and offered samples (opposite of last time)

I had the 2x1. Brisket was very good and the hot link was great-perfect amount of heat. 

The Smoakie Beans were great too. 

I encourage everyone to give it a second chance if you had a bad experience when they first opened. 
I will be back"}
{"text":"This is NOT ENOUGH PORTIONS For The PRICE!! For $13.99 ..2 pork rib bones (st Louis, so you KNOW how small those were!)...3 slices of brisket(MORE FAT THAN MEAT). .. a small scoop of beans.....no bread...nope!!! Totally not worth it TO GO! My sister, got rib tips and Marconi & cheese for $9.99... MUST HAVE WAY BETTER PORTIONS.. taste OK..."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING! DISGUSTING BARBEQUE EVER!!!  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!
I ordered the 2x2 platter with hot links,  ribs,  mac and cheese,  Smoakie beans.  The mac and cheese wasn't fresh and lacked any type of flavor.  The Smoakie beans looked good but were horrible in taste - no taste at all.  Not good when you pull a big glump of fat out of the beans.  Disgusting!!  The hot links were less than average.  The ribs,  and I use the term loosely,  because I really don't know what type of meat this was.  The ribs had a red ring that circled the meat.  There was this slimy type of  skin that was on the ribs and when the skin was pulled back it looked like small white hairs on the meat.  The ribs had this odor that was PUTRID!!  It was stomach-churning. The ribs were not fresh and smelled like they were warmed over from another day - smelled like the meat was spoiled.  I honestly cannot confirm what type of meat this was (was it dog meat).  Honestly,  this place should not be in business serving food this disgusting.  I am angry for wasting my money - and I am angry that a business felt like serving crap like this to consumers was okay.  My intention is to call the health department because I feel they put my health at risk.  I paid for food that I could not eat.  If I had eaten the food I would be violently ill right now.  Disgusting!!!  Should not be in business.  Shame on those who gave good reviews to this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I am in love. Been looking for a BBQ place for a long time now and I thank God I've now found a home for my BBQ loving palate, the prices are affordable and I'm saying that as a young man ballin on a budget and the food is more that exceptional. I highly recommend Smoakie Kitchen if your I'm the mood for some delicious comfort food!!!"}
{"text":"If I give a 3 or less it's usually because the whole experience was just.  You Know. At First glance great idea  BBQ in a fast casual setting.   Whoops it doesn't work.  For me and for so many SMOKE is a huge part of BBQ and the fact that everything is done inside and. It outside with a smoker is what really made the food flat.   Had a fatty brisket sandwich.   Good price I might add. 6.99  but with a side of potato salad and drink for around $10.  It just didn't have the taste.  Cook the food outside with this setup would have made a big difference in my opinion."}
{"text":"By far one of the best BBQ restaurants I've ever been to. Great food, variety & amazing customer service! Glad my husband and I discovered this place."}
{"text":"I'm very interested in seeing this place stay in Laveen, so I'm leaving 4 stars, and hopefully giving some helpful feedback.  The food was edible, but would be much better with some love.

1.  Adjust your deals. 
- Create more combo deals. (14 dollars for a sandwich, side, and drink is way too much)
2.  Add signage
-Grab potential customer's attention with simple signage showing the type of food, and advertising your \"Grand opening\" deals.
3. Create some special gimmick food items like: 
-Lil smoakies (Some type of sliders)
-Big Smoakie (Big sandwich with multiple layered meats)
4. Lower/change the music (was super loud top 10 stuff) 
-Try playing an interesting genre of music on a lower volume 
5. Add spicy alternatives:
-A spicy version of your bbq sauce.
-Add green chiles to your mac&cheese

Hope this helps. Love the concept, just needs some special attention to be awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where these guys learned to make BBQ, it definitely wasn't in one of the capitals of BBQ (Memphis, KC, NC or TX). Probably the worst meal I've had in South Phx and that's saying something."}
{"text":"I just ate at Smoakie kitchen. They have a $5.99 lunch special that includes sandwich, side, and drink. I had the brisket sandwich today and it was very good. I also had the macaroni and cheese. You can taste the real cheese in it. This is the best value in Laveen for food."}
{"text":"Yum meat and sides.  We got the ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and tips. Extra large portions which is excellent! Friendly good service big plus! Clean & comfortable dining area. Bring your family yum yum yum......"}
{"text":"I just moved back to this area and was like oh a new spot. And reading the latest reviews I was hoping for a good experience here... nah. 
I got the 2x2 and j wasted my money. Chicken was dry as our desert, the greens salty (call me and I will sell you my recipe) and the beans were more of pinto beans with meat; I was expecting baked beans. And they had just opened for the day so it couldn't have been the food had sat. Total disappointment. Were these leftovers reheated??? Either way, I'm trashing it."}
{"text":"We spent a pretty penny hoping it would be good.  Sadly it wasn't.  Guess we will have to continue to drive for BBQ."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time/money. Food was mediocre and for $12 i got a pulled pork sandwich, mac n cheese, and a piece of corn bread no drink. Overpriced. Will definitely be going to jimmy johns next door instead next time."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst barbecue joints that I have ever been to in my 40+ years on this planet. And I've been to many many dozens across the country. I mean I don't even know if I should call it barbecue, I have no clue what this guy thought was in the pulled pork but it definitely did not taste like pulled pork to me. The brisket, I give a D+. The meat was moist however tasted like it was severely overcooked, I'm not even sure how that can happen."}
