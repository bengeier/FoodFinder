{"text":"Rude employees, expensive, owners are both rude.  Horchata is chalky.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, but slow service! It's take them a long time to serve you the food. We ordered pozole and it took more than 45 min to serve it to us. I been here a few times and the wait is more then 30 min to get the food."}
{"text":"great service. great food. good price. try to Dorados tacos. they are freaking awesome"}
{"text":"That moment when you bite into a burrito and feel/hear an abnormal crunch...Spit out your food and realize yes, that is a huge piece of eggshell that you are eating. One of the most nauseating experiences I've had in recent memory... Foul and Disgusting to say the least!"}
{"text":"Expensive! Lousy food! Ordered 2 carne asada burritos and five rolled tacos and it came to over $23. That would of been OK if the food was good. The burritos had rice and beans in them and a small portion of meat. I've never gotten a carne asada burrito with rice and beans anywhere else. It should be all meat. The rolled tacos were like grocery store tacos with scant cheese and a little sour cream smeared on. $23 for this mess. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"Got the rolled tacos AKA taquitos. They were pretty decent, but kind of dry. Would be WAYYYYY better if they threw some more Guac on them. I will probably eat here again, but deff get some extra guac."}
{"text":"No Bueno. Found this on Uber eats and decided to give it a shot. Very disappointed. 

 Tried the tacos, enchiladas, ceviche tostada and Asada cheese fries. Took a few pictures of the poor quality. The meat was either too greasy or dry. The ceviche tostada was bland and my tostada shell reminded me of an air popped corn chip! Not happy with the quality. Won't be coming back :("}
{"text":"Didn't have time to take pictures the food was to good to stop and take a picture order the tacos DE AL pastor tostada DE cuerito torta DE pierna and a torta augada hands down the best Mexican food I have had in a long time and will be coming back soon oh and they play Vicente Fernandez so that makes it 6"}
{"text":"Just like in Guadalajara! The tortas, tacos, enchiladas! Everything is delishes! Love eating here!!!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and were craving some good tacos. I found them on DoorDash but decided just to stop by instead. Was looking forward to eating my lengua and tripa tacos. Sadly I was disappointed. They were flavorless even with the additional salsa from their salsa bar which was overly watered down. Was not thrilled and will not be going again."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and we live off of Estrella Parkway. Needless to say, a bit of a drive. The food more than held up. I had the cheese enchiladas and a few rolled tacos. All of it was fantastic. I am looking forward to many more late dinner deliveries."}
{"text":"Tortas Ahogadas George is our families favorite. We come here at least once a weekend, sometimes twice. We love their breakfast, chips and salsa, and tacos. Their Caldo de Res is the BEST in the Valley. Hands down!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The service was nice, I ordered a chimichanga combo to go and a large horchata. My order took a while, and the guy after me got his food first. Ok, so I'm expecting a pretty great chimichanga. Meh. For a $12.00 meal I would have expected more chicken inside, and there wasn't much rice with the combo. The horchata was very gritty. I could have just roughed it and gone to Filiberto's drive thru."}
{"text":"Very authentic!! Tastes just like the little diners from Guadalajara !! Price is reasonable and everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious.

The service was a bit quiet and standoffish but this is counter service so totally do-able.  

There is a salsa bar with radishes, spicy carrots, etc.

Shared the 2 shredded burrito plate with my daughter.  The burritos were amazingly delicious.  I didn't taste any of the rice, beans or salad but she enjoyed them.  The picture showed a few chips on the plate and we didn't get any so that was a little disappointing.  

Hope I am in the area again to have that burrito!  Tortilla was good.  Meat was good.  Had beans and other stuff in it also.  Mmmmmmm   Mmmmmmmm Good."}
{"text":"Authentic and Delicious

If you want great Guadalajaran food without the trappings of margaritas, beer and decor, Tortas Ahogadas George is the place for you. To be honest, if it wasn't for the \"Yelp\" reviews we never would have gone into the building, but I'm so glad we stopped in. 

The food at Tortas Ahogadas George is authentic and delicious. The restaurant has a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. The owner went out of his way to explain the menu and even made suggestions on what he thought we might like.

You place your oder at the counter and your entree is delivered to your table. The menu is not too large but covers most everything you would see in a typical Guadalajara restaurant with one catch; everything is made fresh.    

Today, I opted for the Tacos de Barbacoa and my lunch companion had the pork chili verde.  Both entrees were seasoned perfect, moist, and full of flavor and the corn tortillas were made from fresh masa, one of the best tortillas I've had.   We enjoyed every bite of the rich and delicious flavors. 

The portions are generous and the prices are very wallet friendly. A definite stop if you want some great food with a soft drink."}
{"text":"I've eaten in many many Mexican restaurants. This one ranks right up there. Great salsa bar. Great service and the Tacos de Barbacoa were amazing! Very very good! All in all FIVE STARS from me!"}
{"text":"Don't. Save your money. We ordered carne asada burritos and I should've just asked for my money back. The tortilla was so hard, the carne asada looked and tasted like it had been reheated over 3 times easily. We also ordered chicken strips from the kids menu and let me tell you those were not chicken strips. The French fries didn't really even look cooked. If I could give it 0 stars I would. I will not be back and I definitely suggest you go elsewhere. Just don't."}
{"text":"Drove from Gilbert to try the tortas ahogadas since I haven't had a good one since I left guadalajara and wasn't disappointed! It was all so good and we ordered the hard tacos on side, and barbacoa which was so delicious. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"One word Awesome!!!! Great food great staff. Picked up foos to go. It was well packed, the servings are large. Aguas frescas are fresh homemade and delicious!"}
{"text":"From the customer service to the quality of food this please has great food! My husband and I eat every last bite. The balbacoa tacos was a winner and their steak & eggs burrito with potatoes was also a winner! We will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
