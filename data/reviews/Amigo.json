{"text":"Petit restaurant chinois à l'étage. Beaucoup de choses à la carte ; sûrement trop. J'y ai notamment mangé du porc aux légumes chinois : très bon mais un peu simpliste, manquait peut être d'un peu de riz en accompagnement. Accueil peu chaleureux."}
{"text":"Coming from an Asian who's visited a fair share of Chinatowns in North America, there is little doubt that these chops will be the best you've ever had the pleasure of putting your lips on; aside from the ones on my face. You come here for this dish and this dish only. Don't bother with anything else other than a beverage. Guaranteed to satisfy.

On each of my experiences here there has been a lone waiter. Older gentlemen, but you couldn't tell by his swift and deliberate movement between the kitchen, the tables and the register. This man does it all and deserves a firm slap on the ass for his hustle. Good game!

Seriously, is it just me or is the 11pm close time posted here wrong? I'm pretty certain that on at least 2 occasions I've dined-in after 3am on a Friday and Saturday night... Or was that supposed to be on the hush? Oh well, just another reason (as if I need one) to return and test my memory.

{"text":"Simple decor but this place that could easily be looked over is a gem. I was introduced to Amigo by a Co worker. I have been going back regularly since. The food is flavorful. It's the kind if meal that feels like amazing comfort food. It's very affordable. They serve rich portions.  My favorite dishes are the noodles, the salt and pepper pork chops and the chicken and shrimp in mayo sauce."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim,

We wanted Pekin duck and they happen to serve it. We found out (after we ordered) that they also serve rice baked in clay pots, something you see commonly in Hong Kong, that made me curious. Funny thing was that menu was written in chinese and the waiter read it out for us, you can have rice with pork chicken chinese sausage, taro I think one even had pork belly, oh man yaoza!!! but we had already ordered so maybe next time...

The pekin duck was fine, except the wrapper were a bit thin and they seemed a bit dry, they were thin and cool down really fast, and being dry them aren't too soft and bendy, they become flaky quite fast. I suspect they got these from Kim Phat in the frozen section, cuz they taste very similar. They are definitely not fresh made that's for sure.

the rest of our food was good, we had salt and pepper pork chops, and chow mein all very nice and standard. And the best thing was it cost less than 20$ we were four and ate like pigs, hihi score."}
{"text":"The food is cheap and its really good! If you go there, you must try the salty pepper pork chops and the chicken mayo!!! The service is okay, nothing fancy, but the food is served quick."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese restaurant in Montreal. 

First, the Hot Deal costs 13.5 but many told me it is 7.5 before I went there. The price seems random and they charge whatever they want.

Second, the tips is 2 dollars for the Hot Deal and it is compulsory. So the total for a Hot Deal is 15.5, which is more than twice as said by others.

Third, admittedly the portion is big, but the quality is the worst you can imagine. The pork chops ae so greasy and the rice seems like left over from yesterday. It's definitely not the kind of Chinese food you see regularly.

In addition, the staffs are so rude and there is no service."}
{"text":"Salt and pepper pork is great! Thanks Yelp for this discovery! Les cotes de porc sont excellentes !"}
{"text":"I came here before with a group of friends. This time, I came with a close friend.
We ordered the famous pork chop rice and some dimsums. I wasn't really hungry on that day.
Pork chop was amazing. Crispy and juicy. UNEXPECTED egg on the rice. That's a big YES! It also come with bok choy to balance the meal. 
I had lots of pork chop in my life. This one quality is outstanding.
In terms of dimsum, the sui mai (pork) was a disappointment. The ha gao (shrimp) was alright. 
I think it's better to focus on their specialty. Mayonnaise chicken is a must to try.
The meal came with good tea. 
Good service. Good ambiance. Nothing too fancy. 
Good for a quick lunch or night dinner with friends.
Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been mourning the passing of New Dynasty since that legendary gang fight that just left the restaurant in shambles.

One day, my dad brought me here and I was like \"you serious?\", it's called Amigo?
Walk up the dingy entrance to the second floor and enter an unsurprisingly dingy dining room area with the classic round tables and layers of white plastic.

Now, I'm no expert in Chinese food. I do love any form of Yang Chow Fried Rice, Cantonese Chow Mein, Won Ton Soups and Half Chickens. They have all these and do it amazingly well. Their specialty, Salt & Pepper Porc Chop is okay. After a few bites you're nearing a stroke by all that lard and pork fat. But that's okay. You'll share it with some friends.

I heard they replaced the carpet with some wood floors. They definitely deserve 6 stars now."}
{"text":"The sweet and sour pork rice set I had was really good - pork was really tender and crispy on the outside, though the sauce tends to get a little sickening after a while as it's prepared a tad too saccharine. The har gau (shrimp dumplings) were a different story...skin was way too thick and they need to use more shrimp in the fillings."}
{"text":"Great place for quick inexpensive Chinese food"}
{"text":"I came here during lunchtime today for their \"renowned Salt & Pepper Pork Chops.\"

I was extremely disappointed, let me explain.

The portion was very small (at least the one I got) comparing to other places such as Keung Kee or Restaurant Cantonais, and there is no consistency in their dishes. I've got about half a bowl of rice while others got much bigger portions.

The pork chops were extremely overcooked and very tough to eat, my fork was entirely bent when I was trying to cut through those things. The seasoning was alright, and the outer shells were very crispy, but that cannot mask the toughness of the meat. 

Furthermore, there is no \"Chinese green veggies\" or fried eggs as advertised and mentioned by other Yelpers. You can find some bits of eggs here and there in the rice, and that's it, talking about cutting costs.

My girlfriend had the Sichuan Style Tofu, and it was basically fried tofu stir-fried with onions and sweet chili sauce. It was extremely bland and disgusting to eat, not to mention that fried tofu does not even exist in Sichuanese cuisine.

The wonton soup that came with the lunch specials was pretty good, right amount of fillings and the seasoning was alright. Their Spicy & Sour soup was very watery and lacked all sorts of seasoning.

The restaurant is ran by one chef and one waiter, and therefore there is almost no service as the waiter was busy serving 7 tables. We had to write our orders ourselves...

The ambiance is pretty dark and boring, the restaurant is very small but not comfy or cozy at all. It is not well lit and the place is not very clean either.

The difference from the actual dining experience and these Yelp reviews from 2010 would be comparing your Big Mac with the one in an McDonald's ad. I'm not sure if we went on an off-day but I seriously doubt it, if they can screw up their \"signature dish\" this badly then it's pretty pointless to come back and try again."}
{"text":"Five stars for the only dish I've ever ordered in this place!  Every single time I've been here (once or twice a year over six years), it's been just as crispy, tasty, and delicious as I remember.  Pepper and salt fried pork chops, fried rice, fried egg, and some Chinese greens.  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"There's only one thing I really come here for and that's the HOT SALE: salt and pepper pork chops with a fried egg on fried rice with a some bok choy. Greasy delicious chinatown perfection and if I remember correctly, it's less than $10 for a heaping portion! It's a legendary orgasmic dish, high in calories, but packs a real punch in the flavour and satisfaction department. I've never finished one of these plates to myself, and I'm a total glutton. 

This is total guilty pleasure comfort food. It's the kind of meal you want to eat after a break-up, before you break into that pint of cookie dough ice cream you have waiting for you in your freezer."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on Saturday was surprised to even find it was a restaurant . Little fly in the wall place. Ordered general tao, pork chops which comes with fried rice with an egg on top. I love pork chops and these were the best I've tasted in a while! 

Only negative thing would be the bathrooms...they smell and it's dirty! They could really use a deep clean!"}
{"text":"Amigo! The best place in Chinatown since Van Roy closed down. Love their all dressed pork chop or their lunch menu. Their lunch menu is very cheap, nothing cost more than 10$. With that, you get an egg roll + a big plate! I have been there for late night supper which was really good. We were a group of 20, the service is always excellent. You obviously do not go there for the decoration but the food. It's pretty clean. They accept interact, mastercard/visa & cash! Go and try their all dresses pork chop & you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Supposément les meilleures cotelettes de porc sel et poivre de Montréal.  Boff...je n'ai pas été surprise du plat. Par contre le riz avec un oeuf frit  était  super bon. J'ai aimé  les rouleaux impériaux. Sérieusement, en lisant les commentaires de yelp, j'etais persuadé  à quelque chose d'extraordinaire.  Un resto digne du chinatown, là où  les tables  sont recouvertes de plastique et les toilettes servent aussi à entreproser des trucs du resto."}
{"text":"Once upon a time in a mystic land full of joyful delights and food deliciousness their existed a most amazing culinary masterpiece. Some would say a near perfect example of all that is great and good in man. The legend states that this dish was the one dish to rule them all, the one dish to find them and one dish to bring them all together and in most excellent taste bind them. This legend has existed for many centuries passed on through fables and stories in bar rooms and fireside chats. It was said that one day it would return to the realm of man and show itself to those it deemed worthy and possess enough humility to truly enjoy its greatness. I am here today to tell everyone that just like our good friend brother Jesus, this dish has risen and returned to us. And you say \" Chris do tell us please what is this culinary masterpiece you speak of?\" Well brothers and sisters of the world you need no longer wait. All that is left is to simply walk in and say HOT SALE!"}
{"text":"This is just a gem in Chinatown. The chef and entire staff are very nice. The food is excellent! I will be back again."}
{"text":"5 stars for all-dressed!

This legendary post-night dish is best done at this Chinese greasy spoon.

There really is no other choice."}
{"text":"Lemmie guess, you just left Arena or some 737 Asian party... well this just happens to be the best place to hit up. Order a \"Hotsale\" and all your wildest dreams will come true.

Seriously, great food, great prices. Opened pretty late on weekends."}
{"text":"Je vais la faire en français celle-là.

La nourriture est excellente. Les chops de porc salées sont juste assez assaisonnées et épicées. J'aime l'ambiance parce que ça fait rétro dans le style chinois. Pour une première date par contre, on repassera pour le romantisme. Il y a des combos écrits en chinois sur le menu. Pour 20$, on a une grosse soupe au chou, algue et tofu, une grosse portion de chops de porc, une assiette de buf et book Choi et un gros bole de riz, sans oublier les biscuits chinois.

Très bon service, monsieurs souriants et attentionnés.

Un des meilleurs cantonais du quartier."}
{"text":"Famous for their salt and pepper porc chop, Amigo is a great little find in china town. We also had fish cake and Chinese broccoli dish and the beef and lily flower hot pot dish. The later dish has really nice texture and also has other mushrooms and vegetables. 

Lastly, our waiter was very nice and attentive. All in all, a very positive review!"}
{"text":"Who knew! 

This little place would have honestly one of the best Chinese food in Montreal!
It's a big statement coming from me but I've had my fair share and trust me it's good.
What brings me back? Those famous Salt and Pepper pork chops! 
The lunch special comes up to 12$ And it's a bang for your buck. That would be my first recommendation.. my second would be to try the various chicken and seafood options which are great to share and enjoy other people's company.
I can't say much more but I would definitely bring people here for a quick bite!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"#1 pork chops, as per their menu. Really? I mean, there are a lot of places serving salt and pepper pork chops in the city, and proclaiming it #1 is a big task. Let's go and get a taste of it!

Door hidden between 2 stores leading to the restaurant upstairs, it is quite easy to miss this restaurant when strolling around Chinatown. But don't let this run-down appearance deter your experience; the food is indeed quite good, and I would tend to agree that it is indeed one of the better pork chops I have tasted in Montreal. Taste-wise, it was a good mix of salty and lightly spicy, which goes well with white rice. 

The restaurant serves a special menu for lunch time during weekdays which I find it a very good deal: for 8$ after taxes, you get a small bowl of wonton soup and a plate of rice (fried) with any kind of meat you would like. I obviously opted for their sal & pepper pork chop. Needless to say, it was more than filling. However, if you feel even more hungry, you can get their special at 11.50$ that gives you a LARGE plate of fried rice, with huge amounts of pork chops, bok choy and a fried egg.

Truly a place to not miss if you want to discover cantonese food in Montreal, located in the heart of Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Hot sale is pronounced like it looks.... Hot Sale.  Not Hot Sa-Le.  Typical American who thinks everything in Montreal is French or maybe Spanish mistake I suppose.  The name Amigo is also deceiving-- there's nothing Spanish/Mexican on the menu-- it's a Cantonese restaurant to the core!

Now for the Hot Sale-- it's pure genius.  It's what I crave late nights.  It's what I crave when I'm piss drunk, hung over or both.  It's what I crave when I'm in Chinatown.  Salt and Pepper Pork chops, egg fried rice, a fried egg and some fried boy choy!  Flippin fantastic.  If you read the red Chinese scroll on the wall-- he's self proclaimed famous for his fried boneless flounder and salt and pepper pork chops.  Everywhere you look, there are posters of the owner being named one of Canada's Top 100 Chinese Chefs, etc.  Most of it's probably BS anyways but the FOOD is NOT.  5 pork chops on the Hot sale is no joke.  It's fried perfectly and lots of salted hot chilis all over the dish.  If I lived in Montreal, I would be coming here every night.  Booyah."}
{"text":"Took a leap of faith on the verbal recommendation of the Chinese lady selling rubber shoes downstairs.   Ordered the wonton soup. Crispy chicken, seafood bird nest and beef with ginger and green onion. Also I asked for some ground ginger and green onion in salted oil as a delicious dip for the crispy chicken.   Dinner was great. I'd recommend the food at the Amigo.  The men's washroom was gross the women's was better but still dirty.  I wasn't there for a wonderful bathroom experience I was there for the food. And for that review I'd say it was great.  Our server did a great job too. .  We left him a 20% gratuity."}
{"text":"Came here after a recommendation for its famous salt and pepper pork chops, and I'm glad I did. There's a huge yellow sign with Amigo if you can't find it and its located on the second floor. As I walked up the steps, I didn't know what I was in for. The whole place was completely empty, tables were covered in white plastic bags, and covered up windows. Sketch much? 

But anyways, we were starving and ordered four hot sales. When the dish came out, we didn't anticipate the portion to be so huge. There were like 5-6 pork chops, perfectly cooked and crispy. Large bowl portion size of fried rice that seemed to be cooked in a layer of oil and fat. But that's what made it so good. A few bok-choy here and there as well as a large fried egg. I didn't finish it nor did two others so our leftovers combined seemed like two full orders. My bf was the only one that finished everything and boy did he have the itis. 

The waiters speak Chinese and French, but understood our Chinglish. 
 
Get the Hot Sale. That is all. 

Credit card accepted over $10"}
{"text":"I go here occasionally when I'm around the Chinatown area and want to grab a bite to eat.

I will normally order either Cantonese Chow Mein or their Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with rice.

I really like Cantonese Chow Mein and I've never had any issues with Amigo's Cantonese Chow Mein. During my recent visit to this restaurant, I ordered Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with rice.

This restaurant has three Salt & Pepper Pork Chop dishes/plates. You have the plate that is only Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, another plate that they call \"All Dress Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with Rice\" and finally \"Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with Rice\". When I'm in the mood for Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, I will order the \"Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with Rice\". The only difference between this dish and the \"All Dressed\" dish (excluding the price) is that the \"All Dressed\" dish included a fried egg. I'm not crazy about eggs so the regular Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with rice is fine for me.

When I come to Amigo with my family, they will sometimes order one of the dinner meals that comes with salt & pepper pork chops.

The Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with Rice comes with a few pieces of Pork Chops (deep fried) with some spices/peppers, rice, and what I believe are a few pieces of bok choy or Chinese cabbage (but you can see my order from my uploaded picture). I didn't count the pieces of pork chops but I felt that for the price that I paid, it was a good deal. After eating my dish with some Chinese tea, the waiter gave me a fortune cookie with a piece of candy. I was full after my meal. I could have eaten more but I was more than satisfied with the amount of food that I got.

From the posted signs, this place accepts credit cards but only if your order (not including tax & tip) is more than $10."}
{"text":"Coming from Cantonese China where fried pork chops ???? roam the streets as night food, I can say this place has one of the best fried pork chop I've had. The place is quite small and run by only 1 waiter, but their food is truly great and authentic. Would recommend visiting here with a Chinese friend for sure though, and order the pork chop and the daily specials they write on the walls."}
{"text":"Went here thanks to yelp!
Hidden restaurant in China town so you could miss it if you aren't looking for street numbers.
Ordered sweet and sour pork which was delicious and came with green tea. Service wasn't all that great even when I was the only person in the restaurant.
Would probably order take out next time so you don't end up sitting awkwardly there by yourself with the staff!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I see the charm. Yelp, you let me down on this one ..?

Amigo isn't bad, but it's also nothing particularly special. It's like Panda Express or any other typical Chinese joint. The food options are standard, the tastes and flavors are pretty run-of-the-mill, and the presentation is very much average.

On top of that, it's about as hole in the wall as it gets. Kitschy decor, plastic tablecloths and cheap rickety chairs, the whole deal.

Maybe there's something I'm missing .. but if there's a charm or secret to Amigo, I didn't quite catch it. Hard pass on this one."}
{"text":"Amigo restaurant
 
One of the best Chinese food in Montreal. When I used to live there, we would go here after clubbing or just need a place to hangout in the late nights. 
 
Location: Right in the heart of Montreals Chinatown. Not much parking, mainly on street. It's on the second floor, making it hard for people with mobility issues. Small place, lunch and dinner hours are usually busy but worth the wait. This is a hole in the wall people, don't expect a Ritz Carlton. 4/5 stars
 
Atmosphere: Nothing really special atmosphere. It's a typical Chinese restaurant. No loud music and no tv. It can get rowdy and loud depending the kind of crowd is in the restaurant. 3/5 stars
 
Service: For a place that gets busy, the service is great. Friendly waiters, the owner is also very friendly, making sure everything is to your satisfactory. 5/5 stars
 
Food: Best Chinese food in the 514. They are known for their pork chops, but they have a great chow mien and the deep fried squid is also good. Back to the chops. This crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Not too salty, and if when you add the hot sauce, it brings it to another level! 5/5 stars
 
Price: The food is reasonably priced. Last I was there, we had ordered; pork chops, fried squid, chow mien, BBQ duck and some rice. Plenty to bring leftovers back home. 4/5 stars
 
Overall: This place has not change one bit! Delicious back then and still amazing now! 4/5 stars

{"text":"Let's be clear.....you do not come here for ANYTHING but the \"hot sale\". Yes, Hot Sale is basically a great deal or special that they came up with a while back and it became worthy.

Plastic on the tables, windows covered up and maybe the dirtiest menus around. Order the HOT SALE and move forward.

What you get- a TON of fried pork hops in some form of delicious batter, rice, fried egg and rice.

This is a place to go to say you had it, it is good....it is a Hot Sale. My recco is to not eat fried food for 1 week prior, do not plan in having hot wings anytime the next week. 

Glad I went and did it. Now I'm good."}
{"text":"Oh, man. I tried the salt and pepper pork chops (the lunch version, not the full-on Hot Sale), and it was delicious. Juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. I want more. I would have these every day if having battered fried food all the time didn't kill you. 

We also had mixed veggies and wonton soup, and they were pretty good. Even the hot tea they put out for everyone is quite decent. They pale in comparison to the pork chops, though.

The waiter is very friendly and is always hustling. The food comes out quickly and all at once. A few seats for singles and pairs, and a few tables with lazy Susans for larger groups.

I personally love places that don't really prioritize decoration. Amigo has layers of plastic covers on the tables that they can just dispose of and posters that haven't changed in years. I think it allows me to concentrate on my pork chops. 

I will be back for the Hot Sale very soon."}
{"text":"I came here at midnight, and the food was delicious. We tried the cantonese friend noodles and it was made very nicely. The old man serving us was poite and quick. Decor is okay, and this place is great for people to come hangout in the middle of the night over yummy chinese food :)"}
{"text":"They took my order wrong. The signature dish is a Little too oily for a Chinese. The set menu is fairly good."}

{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: The entrance is a bit hidden but it leads you to a second floor. Inside looks a tad bit rundown. You can tell that the restaurant has been there for a while.

FOOD: The food was ok. Mind you I came here at around 11 at night. I ordered the beef rice-noodle stirfry with a Chinese broccoli dish. I've had better elsewhere. The veggies were way too salty to my liking and the noodle dish was just ok. I do hear that they have the best pork chops in town so I will be sure to come back to try that. But if it wasn't for that, I probably wouldn't come here.

PRICE: For the vegetable stirfry, I thought that the portion was not worth the price. Overall, prices weren't too bad but it wasn't worth it for the quality that you're getting.

SERVICE: Service was ok, classic Chinese restaurant servers."}
