{"text":"Every time I have ever tried to go to this place they are either closed or closing. Like just now, it's not even 8:30 pm and the waitress just told me they're closing and sent me away. I do my laundry at a laundromat across the street and always thought wouldn't be nice to have a beer or a bite to eat while waiting for my laundry, but I've never had the chance because there is no logic to the hours."}
{"text":"Great to have a bbq place in the neighbourhood. Kind, helpful staff. We were a table of 2 and got the shared platter for 2. Huge portions and prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Most underrated BBQ place in toronto right now. Still not sure how this flies under the radar. BBQ platters are reasonably priced. U can get one main or a sampler of two items and it comes with two sides. Selection of BBQ sauces at every table. U will not leave hungry. My type of place.   I personally go for the 2 item platter with ribs and corned beef brisket. Then I get Mac n cheese and sweet potato fries on the side. Back ribs are unbelievable too!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice place to watch the game. The pulled pork sandwich is excellent and the portion size feeds me for two full meals."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends here, rather dissappointed.   Service was so slow!!  Took over 45 mins to get food.  Not only that, but so many of the items weren't available!!  No corned beef?!?  Had to settle for regular ribs.  Portions are decent, but I was starving after waiting so long.  For the price and service, I rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great old-fashioned BBQ spot. Went with a group of guys and ordered the family feast which is an amazing deal.   - Beef Brisket - One of the juiciest and flavourful beef briskets I've ever had! The bring it out chopped up in big chucks vs traditional slices. The owner gets the brisket from the US at some special butcher. It's a premium cut of meat and  you can clearly tell. Seasoning was just perfect. Lots of great smoke flavour with a good bit of sugar.  - Ribs - Great dry-rub, heavy on the garlic but seems to work perfectly. The ribs are maybe a bit too tender and don't have that classic BBQ toughness that you look for. I didn't see a smoke ring on either the Back or the Side ribs, unsure why not. Delicious either way though. St. Louis Style ribs are more flavourful so if you are only going to get one type I recommend those.  - Pulled Pork - this was good but it is def not the best out of the ones we had. Would be great for a pulled-pork sandwich but is sauce heavy. Not a great BBQ addition usually anywhere you go unless served with lots of juicy barque and fat..in this case it's just pretty standard.  - Side: We had waffle fries, coleslaw, mac and cheese and potato salad all of which were great but we hardly touched them as were focused on the meat.  You won't be disappointed with this place if you are a BBQ fan. I think many of the people who aren't satisfied don't really know what BBQ is supposed to taste like. If you like dry-rub smoked premium cuts of meat that go here!   Tip: The owner is pretty pride of his corned-beef. Worth trying but not true BBQ."}
{"text":"One of my new favorites. Get the sampler and definitely get the pulled pork and Texas brisket. I'll be there again soon."}
{"text":"I hate it when I finish a meal and feel as though I have wasted my money.  I had high hopes for a restaurant that specializes in BBQ, and had expected a tasty meal, since there is so much BBQ competition in this city.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the food, and was not impressed with the service.  My BF and I went on a Thursday night for dinner at 7pm and it was dead, although it did pick up as we were leaving.  The tables and BBQ sauce bottles were greasy and had dried food on them, and the table we were sat at was next to the drain pipe for the AC, not ideal.  In terms of the food, the price is certainly right for the portion size, and we ended up taking a lot of food home.  Here is a run down of what we ordered...  1/2 chicken - I am positive this came out of the microwave.  I heard the distinctive beep of a microwave, and the chicken was lava hot in the middle as I dug in, with limp and soggy skin and very dry meat, that I needed a swig of beer to help me swallow.  St. Louis ribs - A good size portion for a 1/2 rack but very greasy and fatty.  Seems to be very poor quality meat, and the rub is not very flavourful and tasted mostly like black pepper.    Sauces - their \"go-to\" BBQ sauce, as the server described it, was thick and grainy without much of a punch of flavour to it.  The best of all the sauces is the sesame mayo which I put on all of my sides.  Sides - A very large portion, and the waffle fries and potato salad were yummy, I filled up on these.  The collard greens were not bad but I had expected more flavour from the description in the menu, and the coleslaw was way too vinegary.    CHEAP BEER ON THURSDAYS is the only good thing I can say about this experience.  Coors and Canadian are only $3.50 a bottle!!!  I would say try somewhere else....I hope this  helps."}
{"text":"Me and two bros enjoyed a meat showdown after pumping iron at the gym.  Just what the body needs after you lift.   Food is great here.  I'll be back many times I'm sure.  Texas brisket was unreal."}
{"text":"Outstanding. By far the best bbq joint in the city. The baby back ribs and Texas brisket are two favourites. The ribs have a tasty dry rub, are tender and fall off the bone. The briskets rub is also delicious with a nice crust, succulent meat and the right amount of fat. Huge portions and loads of sides to choose from."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends. They are really good with big group of people.   I ordered the pulled pork. The portions are Massive, but I love it! I got to same me some for later. The taste is really good and the pricing was magnificent ($16 and you get to choose 2 sides). I had some of the Texas style brisket and it was great too. Very tender.   I liked that they don't charge little extra if you want to get the sweet potato fries which I loved. The waffle fries were good too. But the mac and cheese and the corn bread were even better!   The only thing I didn't like was that, yes they do have a selection of sauces (4 types), but as a BBQ house I was expecting more choices of BBQ sauces. I only kinda liked one of them, the Texas rich and bold.   This place is recommended if you like BBQ food for really good price!"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try out this place as I was craving for some good meat in the city. I booked a reservation for 8:00pm, but things came up and I called them to change the reservation to 8:30pm. The lady on the phone told me it was \"NO PROBLEM, TOTALLY FINE\", I arrived at this place at 8:40 (parking took awhile, couldn't find a spot), to my surprise, it was CLOSED! Some waitress saw me looking through the window, she didn't even bother to open the door, she basically told me that they thought we weren't going to show up, so they closed the restaurant. I said, huh? Your website said you are closing at 10pm, it's 8:40? If they decided to close the restaurant early, why didn't she give me a call knowing that I had a reservation? I went all the way downtown, found a parking spot, only for her to tell me that they decided to close early? How unprofessional & ridiculous is that?!? I've never been to a restaurant where they decided to close down early regardless of people's reservations, and if someone is late by 10 minutes they just ASSUME that person isn't showing up, rather than calling them to confirm. She wasn't apologetic at all, and made me feel like it was MY fault for showing up 10 minutes late. This was so disappointing, and I will not be trying out this place. I can't believe a restaurant would have such poor management, and management actually thinks it's okay to screw customers over regardless of their reservations, and to close the restaurant down at any time whenever they feel like it. If your website says your hours are until 10pm on a Sunday, then own up to it! Or else, do not accept my reservation for 8:30 since you were planning on closing at that time anyway.   Terrible, horrible, never go there. Rude staff too on top of everything. What a waste of time finding and going to this place."}
{"text":"I love the food here so much! I've been a few times and it's so much food that with two people, we've got the cheese plate to start, and then shared a 1 person sampler because it was enough ribs, pulled pork, fries, and mac and cheese to be stuffed! The bourbon ceasar is delicious as well! Each time I've been the food has been flawless, but the service leaves something to be desired. I feel like I would have needed an actual flag to get a hold of my waitress, a bit more understandable when busier but even when it's kinda slow it's hard to get good service - torn between an understaffing or just a staffing issue."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and a buddy as it is close to my house and I was recently in Texas so I had a BBQ craving.  The interior is pretty nice...to the point where I felt it was a little out of place for BBQ as I'm used to picnic tables and rolls of paper towels.  I ordered the platter for 1 which is more than enough food for 1 person.  I couldn't believe the portions!  With the platter for 1, you get to choose 2 mains that have an asterisk beside them, and 2 sides.  I picked the Texas Brisket and the St. Louis style ribs.  my sides were baked beans and Cornbread.    The brisket was fantastic while the ribs were okay.  My buddy had the corn beef style brisket and I tried that and it was amazing!  The sides are massive as well.  The bake beans side comes in a bowl that rivals a bowl of soup, that's how big it is!  The cornbread was steaming hot and it felt like i was eating a little personal size cake.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"It's been a while since my last visit to Smoke Bourbon and I was happy to find that not much has changed.  Monday is AYCE smoked wings (with one order of waffle fries).  Each order comes with five meaty wings, smoked to perfection, to start.  The meat is not dry at all, and the flavour is wonderful.  And you can keep ordering more orders of wings until you admit defeat.  We also ordered a platter for one, where you choose 2 meats (note that some meats are considered \"premium\" w an upcharge, but it wasn't really necessary to upgrade) - we had the Texas Style Brisket and the St. Louis Ribs - and comes with two sides - we had the mac & cheese, and forgetting that the wings came with waffle fries, we ordered fries.  Other options could have been:  corn bread, coleslaw, baked beans, collard greens or sweet potato fries among others.  Will definitely have to strategize the sides better next time!  Each table gets a tray full of various sauces to sauce up your meats, but in all honesty, the BBQ here is so flavourful that the sauce is not really necessary.  But the Sweet Fire sauce, and the Zesty are tasty and go well even with the fries.  Portions are very generous, guranteeing the need to take home leff-overs, which work great for lunch the next day (and some even left for dinner too!).  Their bar prices are reasonable as well, so with all of the above, the tab came to ~$62 before tip (but incl. HST & Liquor tax).  The vibe is laid back and friendly;  great sound track and not too smoky in the dining room (particularly with their windows wide open on the night we visited).  In the past, Wednesdays used to be half-priced appies, but it sounds like they're going to change things up a bit, with an updated menu, and likely updated promotions.  But we were  assured that Monday remains AYCE smoked wing night!"}
{"text":"I'm always down for good BBQ foods so I was excited about bourbon.  The restaurant is a nice size that accommodate a lot of seatings and huge parties (we had a party of 20).  The menu had a lot of interesting dishes and there's party combos which I'd recommend but just be sure to come with an empty stomach and a huge appetite.  With a huge party, we pretty much ordered and tried everything on the menu.  Quality and portion was good; a variety of condiments was also available.  Unfortunately the good stuff stops there.  I find the BBQ was overcooked and the text was like soft pulled pork, I think? Lol the ribs and beef were also overcooked and had a weird taste to them.  I came hungry and left stuff but I can't really say I enjoyed the food that much.  Their appetizers were great though.  The fries and Mac cheese hit the spot for my cheat meal.  Another thing worth mentioning is that the waitress was really attentive considering she had to serve a indecisive bunch."}
{"text":"Food is good,  service is unacceptably slow even when it is quite empty. A simple menu shouldn't take 10minutes."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favourite restaurant. Too many times I've left a restaurant hungry. Who cares how good the food is if you have to leave a restaurant poor and hungry? I go past this place every day, and I keep meaning to checking it out. Well it finally happened. I'm just upset that I didn't go in hungry. But I as soon as I started reading the menu, my mouth was salivating, also interesting how a place can find so many different words for bacon. I wasn't too impressed with the service. It was slow, and the place wasn't exactly busy.  It took a while for the server to come get our drink order, but it might have seem like she was just maybe giving us time to get a good look at the drink menu. I got a beer, and my date ordered their smoked ceaser, which had a full pickle and bacon on a stick. I'm convinced maybe this might be worth the wait.  I ordered the BBQ Texas Beef Ribs, last time I ordered beef ribs at a chain restaurant, I was pretty disappointed. Thinking this might be a whole lot fancier place, I ordered the half rack, and thinking that it might be pretty small portions, I corrected it and asked the server to change it up to full rack. This is where I fail. When it came out, it was a full rack with 7 bones that took up almost the full length of the table. It had to placed diagonally just so it would fit the table. For my sides I had the collard greens with bacon and the bbq beans. I would have to say the sides were perhaps some of the best I ever had. I couldn't finish my full rack of ribs, which impressed my gf, since she's used to seeing me finish her meal. But I finished my collard greens, even mom would be proud. I had to wrap up the tasty beef ribs and the beans which were by no means a second place finish. It had a maple flavour to the beans that I could barely stop eating. I'm salivating as I write this review. I will be back and will be telling all my meat eating friends about this place. It's places like this that reminds me why I can't date a vegetarian. Decent size portions, great value for the money, and perhaps some of the best REAL food in the city. Though if you pay extra for boneless/skinless/flavourless breast meat chicken, this probably isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Went on a nice Friday evening and was a little surprised to see the place not very full. The wait staff was very nice and prompt, and the place smells strongly of woodsmoke - an actual smokehouse.   The beer list was a bit weak for this sort of place, but was adequate.  Maybe if the beer list was a little more craft heavy they may see people coming for a beer and bbq more often.   We ordered the sampler for 2 with pulled pork, ribs, and brisket.  Both of us thought the pulled pork and brisket were fantastic. They come dry and honestly don't really need sauce at all. Despite that fact, we had a good time trying the mixture of sauces they bring to the table, which was a good range of bbq sauce flavours (nothing Carolina style though), and they even gave some recommendations on using combinations of sauces that go well together, which got the experimentation going.    The ribs were good but not as great as the other two mains. For sides we went with collards and cornbread - both good decisions.  We brought some of everything home for lunch the next day - prices seem a little high, but you get your money's worth on the portion size.   Good spot in a quiet neighbourhood. Also the one side of the restaurant opens to the street floor to ceiling, which could be real nice in the summer."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great value for money.  The platter is great for sharing. They make all of their own sauces and they are all SOOOO delicious. Its so nice to support a local restaurant and hidden gem.   I think the drinks are a bit over priced and I am not a huge fan of their Ceaser with burbon."}
{"text":"For this I should be able to give them no star! Absolutely horrible! BAD SERVICE! Was my friend's birthday, it was his birthday wish to eat there. We called in to make an reservation. The waitress SHOULD NOT tell us to show anyways if it was not possible to get a seat. Kept us waiting hungry for over an hour, and still no table available for us. When we asked about \"When we will get a table?\", she said really b.s things to keep us hanging. Its fine if you are busy we can eat there another day, but DON'T reserve people aside so they can starve!"}
{"text":"Big old American servings. Great nightly drink and food specials (really!). The caesars are delicious and have large dill pickles and bacon in them. I was a fan of everything I had, the only regret was not splitting an order for 1 between 2 people. So much food!"}
{"text":"Cela fait un bail que nous devions y aller, puis grâce à notre ami nous avons pu découvrir ce lieu pendant un soirée sociale. Les portions sont généreuses, la viande excellente, les saveurs succulentes. Bravo !"}
{"text":"The pulled pork poutine was amazing!  However everything else was absolutely awful - corn bread: dry as a bone and tasted like baking soda  - brisket sandwich was a disgusting giant slab of dry meat with a very strange flavour  - my mom had the sliders and the meat was Overcooked to hell and felt like hockey pucks  - nachos had fake seven eleven-like disgusting cheese and it was served cold  If it wasn't for the incredible pulled pork poutine I would give one star"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night, plenty of room around 730 pm.  The Decor is dark, but friendly due to the massive full size windows facing the street.  As others of mentioned, they give you a lot of food if you order the any of the sampler size plates.   My date and I shared the sampler platter for 2 for $35.  We had the choice of 3 mains and 2 sides.  The selection of mains is a bit misleading thou as you are restricted to about half the menu mains for the sampler.  Nonetheless, I think it's worth going for based on value and the variety.   I also loved the amount of different sauces at the table!  I just love sauces and they had like 8 different kinds for you to experiment with your food.   St. Louis style ribs - I actually found rather dry.  The meat didn't melt off the bones like it should and it lacked seasoning.    Texas style brisket - A MUST TRY.  The thick tender chunks of brisket tasted great.  They were smoked with a hint of sweetness that I'm not sure how they got that taste in there.      Corned beef brisket - There was surprisingly good too.  The slices tasted fresh and were nicely cut thin.  Sides - The waffle fries are great here.  I would have like a bit more though in comparison to the size of the entrees.  We also had the collard greens which was very much needed against the backdrop of all the meat we had that night.    Note - free refills on the sodas, I recommend the root beer!  It pairs well with the meat if you aren't drinking alcohol."}
{"text":"Meh. That's all I can say.   Expected better quality cut of meat for the price.  P.S the brisket was just a smoked chunk of fat."}
{"text":"My two experiences there were both almost inedible - take out ribs a few years ago that were dry and tasteless and then tonight's food being the definitive final attempt, takeout half chicken that must have been a few days old (mushy, grey). Awful."}
{"text":"This place is great! Portions are huge, tones of different sauce options that you can brush on your own.   The coleslaw is vinaigrette based, but still delicious.  The ribs were probably my favourite.... followed by the brisket.... followed by the pulled pork.   Waffle friends are also pretty badass!   This place is definitely under rated and oh so delicious!!  On a side note, the Louisville lemonade drink was SUPER sour on its own, but when paired with all the meat, it went pretty well. If you love sour drinks, this is for you!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for my birthday as the reviews were good and it was close to the venue that we were all going to afterward.  Firstly, we ended up having 4 more people than we originally anticipated and even thought they were busy, they accommodated us without an issue.  The service was quick and attentive. The food was plentiful to say the least. We had read reviews ahead of time so we knew to share platters etc.  The brisket was by far my fave but for those who aren't into cinnamon, you may not enjoy it. The pulled pork was also really tasty. I found the ribs dry but my bf really enjoyed them It's all about preference.   The mac and cheese was dreamy creamy though not as cheesy as one may prefer.  The corn bread is a bit of a disappointment. It was more like corn cake than the corn bread that I am used to. Too sweet.  I'm a huge coleslaw fan but this was also a bit lack lustre. Basically just tasted like vinegar soaked cabbage.  All in all pretty good food with a few minor tweaks. A lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"Went for my 2nd time to Smoke and was thoroughly satisfied! Started with a \"cup\" of the gumbo - a small bowl, really! - which was excellent! And the accompanying cornbread muffin was moist and tasty.   Had the Sampler For 1 - my two meats of choice were the St. Louis dry-rubbed ribs and the beef brisket, with a fresh baked bowl of brown beans (sweet!) and the potato salad. With a taste of the various sauces, I preferred the ribs on their own - the sauces are great, but these ribs were perfect by themselves for me! The brisket melted in my mouth, and combined with bites of the sides, I was in heaven!  The service was superb - friendly and attentive - and I will definitely be bringing others with me next time I come, which will be soon and regularly!"}
{"text":"Made reservations. Their website allowed us to and said we were confirmed. Went all the way there to find out they were closed. We were there at 8:30 pm on a Saturday night (Jan 2nd)...Should probably fix the website so that this won't happen to your customers in the future.. So that when you are closed it does not allow us to make the reservations. This could turn a lot of business away due to this inconvenience. The food looked good but too bad we didn't get the chance to try it and probably won't make  this trek ever again."}
{"text":"Really disappointing.  Had the baby back ribs which the waitress recommended.  Dry and not very flavourful.  This place is about the sauces, but they weren't anything you couldn't make with the stuff already in your fridge (bbq sauce, ketchup, vinegar, sugar and mayo).  Mac and Cheese was pretty good and the fries were great.  Service was a joke.  We asked for water and the waitress came back, put 3 glasses on the table with a pitcher of water, didn't say anything, no eye contact.  I poured for the table.  $150 isn't bad for 3 people, except when you factor in that this was a step below Kelsey's in quality.  The chicken wings were flavourless and dried out."}
{"text":"*Update* I returned here and received superb service this time. Food was excellent so I am now upgrading their rating to 4 stars.  I don't even know where to begin. We came here on the weekend and the service here was a disaster! When we were seated they took our order. It took over 20min for our drinks to arrive plus an additional 30min on top for our food to come. I noticed all the tables of people who left remained uncleaned for a long time.  Once we got our food they brought my friend the wrong item. After a long wait the server returned to the table to ask if we wanted more drinks, I told her to bring me another beer. That beer never arrived and guess what? I was billed for it! On top of that they gave me the wrong beer this whole time! I really enjoy the food here and the portions are nice and big. That's why I gave this place 3 stars and I will return again. I hope that this was just an odd bad night for them. I really want this place to be a regular option for me."}
{"text":"They say on their web site that they accept bitcoin payments... But they currently don't. Big disappointment.  Now for the food... The beers on tap are good. Only I  pints... Not half pints... The sauces are almost all home made, and delicious. And the main courses... Well... This is a meat place and the meet is really fantastic. You can take a sampler menu which will let you enjoy more than one main course and it's worth it.  The waitress was really nice and her advice on dessert was spot on.  All in all a very nice experience!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!  Food:  AMAZING!!! Huge portions, cooked to perfection, and lots of sides to choose from.  The only thing my friend did point out all their side sauces were very sweet and sugary, no real bbq sauces.  Service:  They've always been super friendly and quick."}
{"text":"The place offers huge portions of meat and sides.  Went here with a big group for a friend's celebration and six of us decided to have the $80.00 sampler of five meats and four sides, but I only got to try three sides, not sure if the other half of the table received the last side, who also ordered the family sampler.   Anyways, the brisket and corned beef were ok but not great.   The smoked tilapia was tasty.  The beef ribs was just ok as well.  I think the main entrees were okay, but the sides were a bit better.  The waffle fries was great, along with the potato salad.  This a great option instead of a Brazilian all you can eat steakhouse, at least you can bring your sampler home, because with these portions, you're gonna have to.  They do not offer individualized receipts which is not good, especially if you come in with a group.  This place gets an OK only due to the large portions."}
{"text":"Huge portions and incredible value. Came here with a large group and ordered several family samplers, so we basically got to try everything on the menu.  However, the meats were just okay. You would think a place that specializes in BBQ would have perfected their meats, but they were unfortunately dry and overcooked and lacked seasoning. It's no wonder they have house sauces because the meat really needed help. My favorite thing of the night was probably the waffle fries."}
{"text":"Went to Smoke Bourbon last night with two friends -- they were closed! Despite no notice of being closed on the 27th on their website! Will never go there!"}
{"text":"Huge portions. Great value and a great atmosphere. This is what a barbecue place should be. The food is a bit sweet for me but not so much that I wouldn't come back. Friendly service and totally unpretentious. Great spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I reviewed this place under its original name (Smoke BBQ House) even though I went after the transformation into Smoke Bourbon Bar-B-Q House, and have to say it was very close to a 5 star experience so wanted to spread the hype on this new profile page since the other has been marked as Closed.  We came here on a Friday night in early April without reservations and were able to get a table without challenge. Really dim room with candles on the tables which added a certain coziness. Once we were settled in and set with some pints from the small but enjoyable draught list including Sleemans Lager, Okanagan Pale Ale, and Blanche de Chambly, we began to order entirely too much food for the 2 of us.  The mac and cheese was really cheesy and I'm happy to have started my meal with it. Pork back ribs were really fall of the bone but a bit dry. The good news is that was easily solved with the dipping and smothering of the 3 sauces available at your table, all of which were good, not sure which one I ended up liking the most. Pulled pork was tasty and a large helping, which was especially good when stacked on top of the corn bread or waffle fries, and then drizzled with cheese sauce that was an upgrade option with the waffle fries. Smoked half chicken was easily forgettable but adequate. I also have to commend them for their cornbread, although the portion isn't the best value compared to any of the other sides. Really wasn't a fan of the collard greens.  4 pints and a whole lotta food for $90 post tax / pre tip is a winner in my books.  See you again soon, Smoke!"}
{"text":"sooooo much food. Seriously it's just too much. The waffle fries are insanely good and next time I'll probably just order two sides rather than having an entree because of how much food it is. The servers are friendly and they usually have a really good jack daniels lemonade thing going on. If you're into getting a lot of food you should definitely come here and you get take the leftovers as take out which will probably feed you for most of the rest of the week."}
{"text":"American size portions. Wow. One entree comes with two sides, and that would have more than fed the two of us. But, we didn't know and ordered two entrees which means 4 sides, which means we brought home more food than we ate.  We had brisket and 1/2 rack of beef ribs, mac and cheese, collard greens, waffle fries and cole slaw. The plate of brisket was massive. Call it a platter - that explains it better. The meats were tender and really flavourful. All the sides were good too: collard greens have bacon chunks, and the fries were crispy and addictive.  The prices were good too - $15 for the entree. You get a ton for the money. Should have just ordered one plate for 2 of us.  This would be a good place to go with a group. You could order a few different things and share.  Our waitress was really friendly, attentive and knew her stuff.   I am not sure why this place isn't busier. It's really good and a good deal. Recommend,"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for some time based on the positive reviews from Yelp.   Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed and my advice would be to save your money for another smoke house.    We were a group of 4, so we decided to get one of the family platters.  We got 3 kinds of ribs, the brisket and the chicken.   We wanted to get the steak of the day, but found out that it was $15 extra so opted out.    The brisket and the beef ribs were definitely the highlight.  The 2 kinds of pork ribs, and the chicken were all really dry.  I don't always like a ton of sauce on my meat b/c I like to taste the flavour of the smoked meat, but it was all so dry you could barely swallow without sauce.    I was impressed with the sauces that they had.  There was a variety of homemade sauces both for those who like spice and those who don't (like me!).  The house sauce and the South Carolina sauce were my favourites.    For our sides we had waffle fries, sweet potato fries, coleslaw and corn bread.  The corn bread was really good.  Two thumbs up.  The waffle fries and sweet potato fries were both nice and crispy.  Can't complain about those.  The coleslaw was unimpressive though and very vinegary.    Nice size dining room, definitely good for groups.  They have lots of tvs for sports, so a good place to get your friends together, watch a game and eat a lot (portion sizes were big!  We all had a nice second meal to take home).    The service needs some improvement.  While it was friendly, it was not very attentive.  Our waitress often disappeared.  I will give her credit though, I actually tripped on the steps leaving the restaurant and tumbled onto the sidewalk and the waitress immediately came out to make sure that I was okay and if I needed anything."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff, great atmosphere and the BBQ is delicious. Not overly expensive and I always need a doggie bag to take home leftovers."}
{"text":"The ribs are tender, but they are a bit too greasy and flavourless. Also, probably because that I ordered takeout, so the dry rub was really wet because of the steam, which really wasn't appetizing at all... But the portion was huge tho.   waffle fries were too salty for me."}
{"text":"We came here with low to medium expectations because of the Yelp rating. The service was perfect. The food was good, in fact much better than we expected. The portion sizes were way too big. One appetizer was enough to fill what I consider be my normal appetite (we ultimately ate less than half of what we ordered). Just seems a bit excessive.  A number of Yelp posters before us complained the sauces were too sweet -- we didn't find this to be the case and I'm usually very sensitive to something being too sweet.  Nice music. I love Sixto Rodriguez."}
{"text":"Ordered the Texas Brisket.. Received mostly fat.. Very little quality meat. The coleslaw was cabbage with vinegar over it. The Potato salad was good. Felt nauseous from all the grease for the rest of the night"}
{"text":"Just had food delivered from here. I got the sampler for 1. Pulled Pork, Brisket mac and cheese and coleslaw.  Place is super badass!! And sooo many sauces!!  Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has become the spot for my family to take family members visiting Toronto out for dinner. This was my second time here and I'm disappointed to say it wasn't as good as the first time I came here. On both occasions I have been there, my family and I have ordered the family sampler good for 6 people: 5 mains and 4 sides (the first time around, we also ordered the sampler for 2 people which gets you 3 mains + 2 sides, since we had 8 people altogether). For our main dishes, we decided to get 3 orders of the baby back ribs, an order of the corned beef brisket and an order of the Texas style beef brisket. Our sides included collard greens, Mac and cheese, sweet potato fries and baked beans. Although overall everything was as delicious as the first time we came here, the baby back ribs were dry and definitely not the \"mouth-watering, fall of the bones\" type. It tasted more like a day or two old and was reheated. Not even their house sauces (such as my favourite one the Sweet Fire) made it good to enjoy. However, I did enjoy their drink special which was the Sleeman Honey Brown lager. It tasted like honey! Definitely a good way to end an amazing day! I'd still give it 4 stars because of the overall deliciousness and massive portions you get, plus service was amazing and personal even with one person serving all the tables!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars here, but really would break that down as 2 stars for the chicken wings, 3 or 4 stars for the sides and 5 stars for the Texas smoked brisket. The difference in quality between the wings and brisket was incredible. I would go as far as to say this is some of the best brisket I have eaten anywhere. Good, friendly service and large portions."}
{"text":"Went here with the fam to grab a bite to eat. After reading some of the reviews and getting to the place, I wasn't expecting much (I am a skeptical American after all).  After being seated, we decided to split one of the family platters and ordered baby back ribs, pulled pork, and beef brisket. We had sides of potato salad, sweet potato fries, coleslaw, baked beans, and cornbread.  Baby back ribs (4 stars)--these were pretty tender but lacked a little bit of flavor in my opinion. The sauces were decent enough to help with the overall flavor.  Pulled pork (5 stars)--the best meat of the night, tender and flavorful  Beef brisket (4 stars)--this was pretty tasty as well but was not as tender as I am accustomed to  All of the sides were decent, with my favorites being the cornbread and cole slaw and my least favorite being the baked beans.  Overall, the service here was very friendly and the portions were huge. I was a little bit disappointed by the sauce selections and wish they had a better dipping sauce for the fries, but you definitely get good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"This place is a carnivore's a dream, a hungryman's paradise, and where cholesterols are raised.  The portion to price ratios are crazy.  Our table of two ordered a corned brisket sandwich and baby back ribs; we could only eat one piece of rib each because we were THAT full.  The corned brisket had a great cured flavour;  the balance between lean and fat was good because the sandwich was rich without being too fatty.  The babyback ribs were not \"falling off the bone\" as I had hoped for but definitely was not dry. The rack was not drenched in sauce but had a sweet smokey flavour, so the taste of the meat was not killed by too much sauce.  We were given three different types of sauces to brush onto the ribs.  We got waffle fries and mac n cheese for the two sides that came with the entree.  Mac n cheese was nice and rich ( I hate it when it's too light and watery); the waffle fries were super crispy but slightly on the oily side.  The only thing I didn't like about the whole meal was the cream sodas we got.  They were too sweet and not creamy enough, so tasted like carbonated cough syrup.  So unless if you're into drinking cough syrup, I would advice against them.  However, that really was not a big issue because we were busy attacking the Flintstonesque portions of meat.  This is the place to eat if your starving and want to get full fast!"}
{"text":"Attempted to visit this place last night, but apparently the kitchen closes at 9:20 as we arrived at 9:23 and were turned away. Might be worth putting on their site as we traveled across town instead of checking out a different bbq place."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for quite some time and finally got to try it.  Portion size here are very good for their platters - a platter for 2 can probably feed 4 people! I came here as a group of 4 and ordered the family platter ($80), and paid $20 premium for the Steak of the Day to be included as one of the 5 main choices (also had pulled pork, texas beef brisket, beef ribs and st louis style ribs).  The platter arrived and it was an impressive sight, and there were definitely way more than enough food for the 4 of us.  Pulled pork was delicious, as was the brisket. However I was not a big fan of the dry-rub styled ribs, and I didn't thought the steak was worth the $20 premium.  The corn bread was a bit too dry for my liking. The mac and cheese and collard greens were good, as were the sweet potato fries.  Overall, I gave this place 3 stars for their generous portion size and pulled pork, but stop short of giving it 4 stars because I thought the items were a miss for me."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Brought my family and we tried a lot! Meat was cooked nice and tender, but maybe could use a bit of seasoning on their own. They have sauces that they made there, but I didn't think they were amazing. Just good.  The sides were okay. Waffle fries are best. The mac and cheese wasn't anything special and this comes from someone who is fine with the kind I can buy in a box at the grocery store, but obviously, I expect better when I go to a restaurant. I've only heard about collard greens from TV and I thought I would like them, but I wasn't a huge fan of it here. Sure there's bacon in it, but not really noticeable when I ate it."}
{"text":"A friend that I had not seen in months wanted to meet for dinner on a Sunday evening. He loves meat, so I suggested we do BBQ for dinner. Normally I would go to a restaurant that I know will be good, like Smoque N' Bones on Queen West, but on this particular evening, I was feeling under the weather, so I wanted to go to a restaurant closer to my apartment. After doing some research, I decided to give Smoke Bourbon BBQ House a try. Though the reviews were mixed, there have been times when I have loved a restaurant that got mixed reviews--or so I tried to tell myself.   When I arrived at 6pm for dinner and saw the deserted restaurant, alarm bells went off. I told the gentleman who greeted me at the door that I had a reservation (not that I needed one since at that time I had the whole place to myself), he looked in a book and then went to speak to a second gentleman in the kitchen, and I heard the second gentleman say to the first, \"it's okay, you can sit her.\" Huh? It's okay to sit me? I made a reservation, so why do you think you are going out of your way to accommodate me?  Anyway, I sat at the back (I did not want to go home smelling like BBQ), and browsed through the menu. Several minutes later my friend arrived, followed by a large party. Slowly but surely, the restaurant started to fill-up--not all the way, but almost 50% of it now had patrons. I told my friend that I thought we should share the Sampler for 2 for $36. The sampler came with three meats and 2 sides. It sounded like a great deal. So my friend and I reviewed our options and decided on the items we wanted to order. However, when we told the waitress our choices, she said that we could not choose from all the mains, only from the ones with an asterisk. Mmmm, I did not read that anywhere on the menu. So we settled on the pulled pork, brisket, baby back ribs, waffle fries and macaroni and cheese. I did not bother with a drink because their beer options were pathetic. Can't remember the last time I visited a restaurant with such few, and crappy beer options.   We received our food within 20 minutes, and when the food arrived, our waitress took a moment to explain the differences between their BBQ sauces (they give you a basket/box with an array of sauces). Once she left, we quickly grabbed a rib. We both took a bite and looked at each other in confusion. Did they put sugar on the ribs? As in, raw sugar as a rub? Not even caramelized? Disgusting! All we could taste was sugar -- granules of sugar! So we went on to the brisket. Oh lord, it was worse than the rib--it had absolutely no seasoning -- completely bland. With apprehension we moved on to the pulled pork, and were relieved by the fact that the sauce was not \"all sugar\" and that it had flavor! I tried to salvage the brisket by coating it in sauces, but it was no use. And to make matters worse (can it get any worse?), the sauces--all 4, had a sweet undertone. My guess is that the chef and/or owner (whoever calls the shots) really loves their desserts.   The only saving grace were their waffle fries and macaroni and cheese. So we ordered a second round of waffle fries and munched on those while our meats sat in the corner, completely abandoned. When we finished our sides, our waitress came around and asked if we wanted to take the meat to go. I told her our concerns with the food--aka, we were unhappy with them because if it was not bland, it was swimming in sugar. She apologized and stated that she would talk to the chef. 20 minutes later and we had not heard anything from her. So we asked for the bill. She came back a few minutes later with our bill, and we were charged full price for everything. I don't know what I was expecting, but usually when I receive terrible food, they either a) offer to get us something else, b) give us some type of discount, c) apologize, d) CARE! So here we sat, staring at the bill wondering where the hell our food went. What if I wanted to give the leftovers to my dog (which I would not--I am not that evil!)?  I couldn't believe it! We ate maybe 25% of our food; our waitress then takes it away seemingly to address our concerns, and returns with a bill and no explanation! So I asked her to please return the pulled pork, the only edible meat we received that night. And hell, we paid for it!  What a horrible experience!"}
{"text":"First of all there are several refinements this place needs to make.  The cigarette tray by the front door, the decor, clearly understaffed service and blaring music would all make me pause before considering coming back.  But the food and by that I mean the Texas dry rub BBQ ribs were simply falling off the bone and mouth watering.  Forget the sauces of which they offer plenty--this stuff doesn't need any sauce.  The sweet potato fries and freshly baked corn bread were also excellent. (Hint:  I would prefer real butter).  The have a decent beer selection and the prices were very reasonable.  So for the product alone they get 4/5.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good ribs, good sides.  3 orders of back ribs one order chicken + waffle fries, 2 sweet potato Fries, coleslaw, bake beans and 3 helpings of cornbread = 4 happy full people. The ribs were fall off the bone good and the sides were all great.  But the Waffle fries were the stand out best. This place serve plain tasty ribs with a side of 8 sauces and a brush so you baste you own ribs at your own preference.   My only slight complaint is that the sauces were \"right out of the fridge\" cold\"but I suppose that is better than \"I wonder how  long this has been sitting here\" warm."}
{"text":"Amazing amount of food for a great price.   I had the sampling platter for 2. Half rack of ribs, beef brisket, grilled veggies and sides of Mac n cheese and sweet potato fries.   The variety of sauces was great and allowed my non-spicy partner to enjoy her dinner while I loved the scotch bonnet BBQ sauce. Sauce could have been a little spicier though...  Great place for a big social food sharing fest."}
{"text":"Went to this place on Friday for my friend's birthday dinner.   We ordered the family sampler for $80, 5 main dishes and 4 sides. The waitress was very polite and ensured we understood what was on the menu, specials, and all the different sauces. The only downfall is that the place is super dark so it was difficult to read the menu.   We ordered baby back ribs, corn beef brisket, texas style brisket, pulled pork, and texas-smoked beef ribs (I just remember we had 2 ribs, 2 briskets and 1 pull pork). The sides were macaroni and cheese, collard greens, coleslaw, and waffle fries.   The brisket, pulled pork and waffle fries were the highlight of the night for me.The coleslaw was overwhelmed with vinegar so after a few spoons, it felt it was burning the roof of my mouth a bit. The collard greens was meh, nothing special. The macaroni and cheese was super bland. I didn't taste a hint of cheese. The corn breef brisket, I didn't touch it.   The meat itself didn't really taste like much, except for pulled pork so we had to put a lot of sauce on it. Is that normal?"}
{"text":"went there last night with some pals for some christmas meat treats. ummmm lets just say we must have been on claus' list of \"nice ones\" because the food was delicious to eat!  we split the smoky wet meat plate for 5 and everything was perfectly peppered and our server did a first rate job of explaining the array of sauces and mustards and other tangy gloops and glops that you can roll your sweaty food bits into."}
{"text":"So we've lived beside this place for about 2 years. The first time we went here we were not prepared for the portion size and rolled out of the place #heavybreathing. I feel like this place is underestimated. The food is great, simple Louisiana style done well with a chill atmosphere. Fun place to go and hang with friends and eat good food. The marketer in me wants to give them a few tips to take to from good to great. I would recommend the smoked chicken with beans (not on the menu?) and waffle fries."}
{"text":"I recently visited this establishment last weekend with about 8 other friends for dinner arount 6:00 PM. As soon as you walk into this place you get hit with a mouthwatering aroma of smoked meat so that gets a start all by itself.  Unfortunately, our server was the only person working that shift as she told us that the other server didn't show up or was sick or something. This made wait times longer than usual with is too bad.  However, everyone in our group thought the food was great and the sauces they serve are great compliments. Of particular note was the corned beef brisket which is phenomenal. We also ordered the St. Louis style ribs, pulled pork, mac n cheese and baked beans. All were great.  Lastly, the entire bill for our table was put on to a single tab by the server, but I didn't ask if this had been agreed on when we were seated. If this is a big deal to you, I'd highly recommend bringing it up as you arrive so as to avoid any confusion seeing as how other reviews of this place show similar instances of this.  Overall, it was a good experience and I'd recommend trying this spot to any fan of BBQ fare."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was to-die-for! We ordered the 6-people platter and couldn't finish the 5 mains and 4 sides. Must try the mac and cheese. We also tried 2 different types of ribs (so-so), bbq chicken (yum!), brisket, potato salad, sweet potato fries (yum!) and coleslaw. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Massive portions... Just massive.   And the meats are incredibly tasty and authentically BBQ'd. Home made sauces, sides that are every bit as good as the main attractions and a friendly wait staff make this one a winner!   Insider tip: try a bit of the pulled pork on top of one of their waffle fries and top it with a squirt of whichever of their 100 homemade sauces and you'll be in BBQ heaven!  Ok (not great) selection of pints and they were on the pricier side but if you pick the right day, there are drink specials to compensate.  Don't miss out on this place, it's the real deal!"}
{"text":"I consider myself somewhat of a meat connoisseur. I like meat, i eat meat, and a lot of it. By far the best way to enjoy the delights of the flesh, is on an open fire or smoked slowly. I've been to (arguably) the mecca of the smoked/bbq meat World ( that would be Texas) and have had the absolute pleasure of sampling various joints throughout the state and have tried various spots in the City to see how they compare.  For the last 5-10 years, Torontonians have had the pleasure of experiencing culinary renaissance. The big food chain restaurants who have historically churned out mostly bland pre made dishes have been slowly pushed out by the independent restauranteurs who are producing something far more spectacular. Within 15 minutes of my home, there are now 3 fantastic BBQ options (Barque & Stockyard being the other two) for my fellow meat enthusiasts and I have to say that this place is tied for first in my books. In fact, i would say the \"eating experience\" is better for me here than the other two solely based on level of comfort while eating (Stockyards is annoying for that) and price vs portions (Barque is annoying for that).   I had the sampler which allowed me to try various options. The ribs were decent but not mind blowing. But the brisket and corned beef were out of this world. Having various sauce options is always a nice touch as well. And did i mention the portions? If you dont leave here stuffed, then you my friend are a superior meat eater as i needed to roll myself out of there afterwards.   Now with all this being said, my previous visit was not as good. I generally don't like giving bad reviews to a restaurant if i didn't like the food as i feel its so subjective (however not the case if i didn't like the service). But food was not as warm as i would have liked it, it certainly didnt seem fresh and tasted like it had been reheated. A lot of \"true\" bbq places only have a finite amount of meats available as they do run out. At least the good ones do. And given the 12-16 hour process needed to create such delightful meals means that once they do run out, you're out of luck until the next day. So, a lot of places reheat unsold and already cooked items in order to save money. This in turn changes flavour and texture CONSIDERABLY which i image was what happened on my first visit.   Of course, i cant say for certain that this was the case on my last visit, but i suppose at this point its irrelevant as my second visit offered me a wildly different experience and im glad i decided to give them a second shot.   Lets hope they stick with quality and run the risk of running out of meat as that in turn will create a far better experience for all those visiting. Id rather they say \"we sold out\" than offer up reheated meat."}
{"text":"In the dawn of such places as Electric Mud BBQ, I can see how this place isn't the \"coolest\" place in Toronto, and I couldn't care less. The BBQ here is better. Full stop.  Hay-uge portions! Each side is a meal, and if you're starving you can get mixed platters for only $20. The smoked chicken, baked beans and 'slaw were what I was all about, and I look forward to returning for their ribs and Monday night wing night! Be sure to wash whatever your pleasure is down with a bourbon Caesar.   PEPPER'S PISSED: It isn't just the sauces that'll stick to your clothes. The smokiness of this joint lingers in fabrics, so be prepared to have dogs follow you home."}
