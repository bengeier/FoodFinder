{"text":"On dit que la mémoire est une faculté qui oublie.  Ce fût le cas pour ce restaurant.  J'y suis aller 3 fois et je me suis demandé pourquoi j'y retournais.  Non pas que ce soit mauvais mais tout y est simplement correct.  Le service est correct, ainsi que le décor.  La nourriture est acceptable.  Il manque clairement d'originalité ou un petit quelque chose qui ferait en sorte que ce restaurant pourrait ce démarquer des autres.  À moins d'être mal pris ou encore une fois d'oublier, je risque de ne pas y retourner."}
{"text":"Beau petit resto de quartier, mais de spécialité asiatique. L'idéal pour un p'tit souper du vendredi soir tranquille entre deux. Bouffe: excellente. Service: lent quand j'y ai été (plus de 40 min avant que nous ayons reçu nos entrées). Bon secteur de la rue Sherbrooke et bonne clientèle aussi. Un incontournable si vous habitez dans le coin."}
{"text":"Chez O is way out in the East End near Cadillac metro.  It is a family-run business with the father doing the cooking while the mother and son work at the front taking care of the customers.  It cooks up typical Chinese cuisine that has been adapted to please the North American palate like General Tao's chicken.  They also do takeout if you live nearby.    You can always count on the service to be quick and friendly here.  The co-owner does a good job in talking to her customers and looking after them.  Empty glasses will be filled with water or wine in no time and food arrives pretty quickly.    For me no visit to a Chinese restaurant is complete without a hot and sour soup so that is what I started off with.  This particular one was more on the sour than hot side but I did enjoy it quite a bit.  That was complimented by a spring roll which was well-seasoned and very crispy on the outside.  Unfortunately after our appetizers things kind of went downhill.  We ordered a fried rice, Imperial chicken and ginger and shallot beef for the main dishes.  To be quite honest everything underwhelmed in that all three were very bland and lacked seasoning.  On the menu it said that the chicken and beef were supposed to be spicy dishes but I didn't find them hot at all.  Let's just say all three could have done with a little more flavour.  Prices are in line with that part of Montreal in that they are fairly reasonable which is what you would expect considering we're not in a neighbourhood like the Plateau or Mile End.  As a whole though the experience was very so so.  While the meal started out strong it kind of declined after that.  I have to say that I would probably come here if I'm nearby and in need of a quick meal but it's not something I would go out of my way for."}
