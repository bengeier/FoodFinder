{"text":"I decided to try this ramen place after reading several reviews online, and after trying this place out, I was determined to sign up an account with Yelp so I can post this review...

I've tried many ramen place in the GTA and I don't consider myself being really picky, but my experience with Shogun was nothing but disappointment. The ramens were inline to Matt's (the other person who reviewed this restaurant) review. To make a long story short:

- our orders came just about 2 mins after we placed our orders... Unless the foods were pre-cooked and got reheat, ramen couldn't be prepared this fast (and we ordered 2 ramens!)
- my wife and I ordered a miso ramen and a tonkotsu ramen. The noodle in the miso ramen was way too thick and tasted like spaghetti while the noodle in the tonkotsu ramen was way too thin and tasted like angel's hair pasta
- agree with Matt, the soup base in the tonkotsu has no depth
- soup base in the miso ramen tasted like if it was made with soup powder from instant noodle pack
- eggs had a sour taste
- porks were dried

We couldn't even finished half the bowl... IMHO Shogun ramen can't even be considered as ramen as their taste is nothing close to what ramen really taste like. I would rather drive all the way to downtown to have ramen from Kinton or Santouka."}
{"text":"Finally a nice place to go to close to home. Steam dumplings are very good. Miso ramen is nice as well. Soup based not too salty and ramen not over cooked. Deco is a bit weird since its a new building but they have a window a/c and walls felt like its been painted with 50 coats of paint. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"ordered their party tray last saturday; tasted fresh and very good...i just love the rolls!!!"}
{"text":"Found this ramen place while driving to a friend's. Got really tired of going to Kenzo for ramen, so I was glad to find that this place just opened! 

Definitely recommend the Tonkotsu ramen. Super super delicious! The jambbong, a spicy seafood broth noodle soup, (spelling?) is also great. Service is fast and nice. They serve pickles and ginger to go with the noodles to cut the richness. One thing I would complain about is the limited selection on the menu, but our waitress said they may expand depending on the current menu's success. Will definitely be a dinnertime staple for me when I'm up there!"}
{"text":"Noticed improvements on noodle and soup temperature over last three months."}
{"text":"Sorry Richmond Hill/Markham. This place will not fill the niche that the downtown Toronto ramen joints provide. (Santouka, Sansotei, and Kinton anyone?)

Ordered the Shoyu ramen. (There were only 6 types of basic ramen. They also  serve beer and sake.)

Slightly overcooked noodles, they were chewy but lacked the depth in flavor like some of the other ramen restaurants downtown.   Soup was hearty, not overly seasoned but at the same time, bland and didn't stand out from something you could get elsewhere like from say any other Japanese restaurant.   But, it did not have any aftertaste which means you know it's not laced with MSG, and was custom cooked.

The 4-5 pork pieces tasted like it was boiled in hot water first and then placed into the ramen bowl as it too lacked any distinguishing flavor.   What stood out most was the pork looked and reminded me of the same ones I buy at the Chinese supermarket when having hotpot at home. Meaning, it's not custom prepared like say at Kinton (they do slabs of pork amazingly well in their ramen!) or Sansotei Ramen downtown.

I'm not sure if the chef uses any special noodles for the ramen as they were very thick, and reminded me of the braised noodles you get when eating a 10 course Chinese wedding meal.  The customary egg was not runny at all, in fact it was poached, it wasn't even a whole egg only half an egg. (Kinton/Sansotei gets this right very well). The nori seaweed was the wrinkly kind that's used in home cooking. Also came with 2 pieces of pre-made artificial fish cake. Other toppings in the ramen were small dried bamboo shoots, light sprinkle of half cut scallions, and some beansprouts.  Overall portion was average, but for $10 you get less than what you receive at Kinton ramen for the same price!  Mind you, the presentation was lacking as the ramen didn't look very appetizing when it was served to our table.  My friend also had the same Shoyu ramen fyi. 

I've heard that this place is run by a husband/wife team and it shows. It was a busy lunch with 8 out of 12 tables filled and the wife was the only one doing double duty as hostess and waitress! I felt bad for her and they can clearly use the additional help.  A large table next to mine had 6 patrons and 4 out of 6 got their bowls but the last 2 guests did not.  She apologized in broken English that it was coming and the soup was being cooked. The guests looked slightly annoyed as their 4 friends were finishing their meal already. 

This place definitely needs to hire more staff. And definitely please clean the fish tanks, I feel bad for the one or two clownfish living in them. (There were 3 tanks, 1 per booth next to the wall. They looked like they haven't been taken care of in years. I hope the fish are fed...)

Overall, this place has/had potential. They recently only converted from a sushi joint to a ramen joint 2 months ago.  They've recently taken out ads in the local Asian newspapers as well. But, in the long term, if they want to have long line ups like the other ramen joints downtown do - they need to step it up and improve on the overall flavor and presentation. The owner needs to try out what other popular ramen joints are doing, improve or build upon it to get into the spotlight.  Because once the new novelty wears off, given the peculiar location it's located at, it may not draw regular business to keep going.

Hiring more staff would also help to improve service, increase turn around time, and create a relaxed atmosphere.  And please clean the fish tanks!

FYI, it is very stuffy inside the restaurant, gives off a slightly humid sweaty smell, there is lack of circulation so people with allergies beware!  

Would think twice about going again, for now I'll stick to my ramen trio of Santouka, Kinton and Sansotei downtown Toronto."}

Deja Vu??

The same fish tanks.. The same deco..The same Korean chef/waitress couple from Tokyo Sushi...

This used to be Tokyo Sushi and now it is Shogun Ramen Japanese Noodle House.

The menu is really limited to 6 different kind of Ramen and that's it... So please make sure you know that's what you want if not you will be disappointed.

Tonkotsu, Miso, Shoyu,Shi-o, Karashi or Woolmen, all priced between $9.95 - $10.95.

Tonkotsu ($9.95)
- The broth is really really tasty! Milky broth is full of flavours and not really salty. Sweet and Savoury at the same time
- Noodles cooked a little too soft and lacking the bite, maybe because they are a little too thin?
- The chasu is the weakest link as the pork though tender but a little dry and taste bland
- Portion is adequate but if you are a big eater, you might fill unfulfilled 

Service is always polite and attentive. 

I definitely will be back to try their Karashi Ramen Level 3!! which is a Spicy Mixed Seafood Ramen......

Shogun Ramen is good as a light meal or a snack with the menu they have now, Give them a try if you are in the Neighbourhood and have cravings for some Ramen.."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out since I was craving ramen and couldn't go make my way downtown. 

Choice of ramen, priced around $9, was very limited but it seems to be like that at most ramen restaurants. 

All in all, fast and friendly service, complimentary kimchi and candy with your bill but unfortunately not enough of a hit to get me to come back.."}
