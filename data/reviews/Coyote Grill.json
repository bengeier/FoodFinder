{"text":"Small hotel cafe... low expectations for breakfast, but this was a surprise. The local menu has some nice selections and interesting and tasty food. Good service, friendly and delicious!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately  I didn't have my phone to take pics, but nonetheless the food was amazing!! We are staying at the red roof in next door and didn't want to drive so we were willing to take the chance with minimal reviews  first off it was very quiet only a handful of people but atmosphere seems good bartender as socializing with guest etc. I don't usually drink but hey I'm on vacation! Long island ice tea came quick and STRONG (which I like for 9.50) my husband ordered a Fanta orange  Food: MOZZARELLA STICKS- six standard mozzarella sticks topped with parsley and shredded parm came with marinara I was a total fan they were my style of coating my husband prefers the red Robin style so he thought just mediocre Coyote burger (husbands) veggies were fresh per my husband meat was cooked perfect and came on great bun  California burger 1/2 pound with normal veggies pepper jack cheese guacamole  fried onions and bacon. A little spicy due to cheese but juicy and great flavor!  Fries hand cut seasoned well   Over all we would recommend highly and staff was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I needed a respite from the AZ heat ( I'm from Florida). This was walking distance from my hotel and I'm glad I made this choice! Tracy served me and she was delightful! The chicken chimichanga was fabulous and I had some wine with it. All, so good! Then, I could just walk back to my hotel. Priceless! I'm going for breakfast in the morning:)"}
{"text":"Edit ****   Oh my gosh the server just made it SO AWKWARD. Like awkward enough for us to discuss avoiding her for weeks at a time. All I did was simply ask if the same complimentary coffee for hotel guests is the same coffee that they try to charge us $2 for in the dining room. It is, so why would I not walk three steps outside to get my coffee that's included in my hotel stay?! After I asked that, she took my order all cranky like and didn't even bother asking if I want toast.   Here is the thing. If you don't like working in food service, stop working in food service. Don't treat people who have a common sense question like crap. The fact that you people charge for coffee is absolutely ridiculous.     I have the opportunity to stay in the hotel while I'm on business a couple of times a month. I've had breakfast twice and tonight I ordered dinner.   Tech specs:   1) The western omelet: it was fine. Better than I would expect at say...a Denny's, but not what I would expect for the price. It's $8.95-ish and it was just okay. Nothing great.   2) the corned beef breakfast skillet. Meh. It was pretty good. Just good. Nothing special. My over medium eggs were cooked perfectly.   3) The Ribeye. This is a $20 steak that comes with a potato and veggies. Served with toast. The steak was cooked okay, but no seasoning. The veggies were the highlight, and the baked potato was old and black inside. Surprisingly at this price point a salad isn't included.   My biggest pain point with this place is that the service is hit or miss, with miss being the trend. No hospitality, no recommendations, the breakfast server was rude and made a big deal about drinks not being within the limit of our vouchers. I need to note that the gentleman morning server was pretty nice and efficient. The service tonight wasn't great. I ordered a steak to go, I'm a guest in the hotel. It's a complete pain in the butt to cut the steak with plasticware.   I do have a constant to compare this to. I worked for Interstate Hotels and Resorts part time on the weekend when I was younger. If anything that makes me a little more forgiving when it comes to service and food quality. This place is convenient if you're staying here and don't want to venture out. It has the potential to be amazing."}
{"text":"I got the stuffed french toast and it was good. The waitress was nice and the food was a good price. If I stay at this hotel again I'll be eating here again!"}
