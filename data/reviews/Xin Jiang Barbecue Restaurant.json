{"text":"Came here so many times and like the late night food and drinks. Close late and perfect place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Be carefull , double check if they are open or not before come maybe for nothing. 
They don t respect their open sign and they close when they want. 
They write everywhere door sign, website and else, they close at 2 am but I came yesterday at 1 am, they look at me like l m crazy to come so late and said we are closed.
l will prefer to stay out of this restaurant, if they can not even respect their own open sign, how l can trust what they put on my plate."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, cheap Asian barbecue style food. Their lamb skewers are the best I've had in Toronto and they are worth a special visit just for their skewers. They are flavored with tons of spices and have an awesome grilled flavor. I also love their bread rolls/buns that have a slightly sweet coating and that you dip in a warm sugary sauce. Really any of their dishes are guaranteed to be good. They even offer chicken bones coated with spices and somehow that's really good. Add in some beer and you have a great meal. Service is quick even when the place is busy. Prices are very reasonable and you will definitely leave happy and full."}
{"text":"Open till 3am, best midnight snack or for a quick bite. Never closed for holiday, literally ate here on Christmas Day and New Years. These Chinese restaurants don't believe in stat holidays which is great for us. 

Recommend the follow skewers (~$2-3 per):
- roasted lamb (obviously, probably what they're known for)
- roasted beef 
- beef tendon 
- chicken kidneys
- chicken hearts 
- quail eggs 
- lettuce
- chicken bones (just roasted bones but it's worth trying if you like chewing/nibbling on things) 

Some of which might sounds gross but you will not regret it. They're deliciously roasted and seasoned to perfection. You have to get spicy if you can handle it, their true hotness scale is around 3/5 so it'll sting a little. 

I always get a veggie dish everytime I come here. Usually get either the bai chai or peas. They have plenty of selection, their tofu, eggplant, mushrooms are all pretty good too.

Usually get a soup on a cold day on top. If you're feeling adventurous then the hot& sour soup is great, but if you're already getting a bunch of skewers then the veggie one is better with a more smoother subtle taste. 

Not the best lamb skewer place I've been to, but the way they season their food and use of spices is on point. The cuisine with their selection of food is top notch. Their service can be lacking as most their employees are usually on their phones or watching shows, language barrier as well as they're mostly mandarin. Bit above average food but their most accommodating store hours definitely place them at a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Used to be better if I remember correctly... the beef and chicken was so dry the ends of the chicken was hard when it came to our table. The beef was so chewing I gave up eating it. The only acceptable skewer I ate was the lamb. The chicken wings are still decent.

If i do return, I'd only get the lamb skewers and wings."}
{"text":"5/5 Food
2/5 Decor
5/5 Service
5/5 Price
Overall 5/5

Tame your expectations, you're here for late night skewers and cheap AF beer. Anything else is extra and a bonus.

The beer is amazingly cheap at $10 for a pitcher, every single day. Where else are you gonna find this kind of deal? Yeah, it isn't amazing, but you're at Pharmacy and McNicoll, not Kensington Market. The reason I'm dropping a 5/5 for service is because I found a fruit fly in my cup, and they were gonna give us an entire new pitcher of beer after my friends had all already drank theirs until I told them it was just my cup. They then gave me a much larger cup filled up with beer.

The lamb skewers are delicious. The spice mix on it is some of the best I've had in Toronto and the lamb isn't too dry or too wet. The sausages are a bit of a letdown though, but that's unimportant in the grand scheme of OMG REALLY CHEAP BOOZE AND EATS LATE AT NIGHT.

It says something when you see people from other restaurants getting off late shifts and coming here to enjoy themselves.

Decor is pretty bad even by my low expectations for Chinese restaurants, but costs have to come from somewhere I guess."}
{"text":"Lamb Meat sticks are okay but not as good as before - flavouring could use more cumin; also disappointed that they changed the noodle in the transparent spicy noodle cold dish :( They were way better before.."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 13 with reservations. Restaurant seats around maybe 40.

Orders are written down on small pieces of paper. If you can't write chinese, numbers are enough. Items come one by one as they are prepared, and if you're not sure what it is just ask what it might be, though interestingly enough when I asked what it was in english the server responded in chinese, and when I asked what it was in chinese the server responded in english.

I suppose their main feature is their BBQ skewers, given that on the first two pages it's full of all kinds of meats and veggies being tossed onto a skewer and grilled. Chicken, beef, pork, lamb, tendon, cabbage, pineapples, shrimp, bell peppers, you name it. You're looking at AT LEAST $2 per skewer, and that adds up fast.

Chicken wings were pretty nice. Preferred it over the chicken skewers.

The skewers were hit or miss. The chicken skewers were tough and thin. The lamb and beef skewers were great. The cabbage skewer was interesting, but I can't say that I'd pay $2 for a cabbage skewer when I'm paying the same for the other meat options...

We ordered a soup consisting of egg whites and pieces of lamb, but there wasn't much flavour. We weren't sure whether it was because the skewers had too much flavour and therefore simply over-powered the soup. Perhaps dipping the skewer in the soups would provide balance things out if you ordered spicy skewers and then realized it was too spicy for you.

Overall, there's a lot of different items, and they're pretty hit or miss.
I'm not sure $2 per skewer would be worth it however given how much stuff actually comes on the skewer."}
{"text":"$8 pitchers
$2 Skewers (Lamb, Beef, Chicken)
$10 entree's and combo's 

Literally can feed an army over here and drink like galavant knights here for less then $50. Who cares if there is lots of spices and probably MSG. For this price, you eat till your merry and drink till your joyeous.

Also finding outdoor seating is a bonus.

Does have a more mature and male oriented crowd later on in the night, however in my eyes this has been a gem since I was in college. Even as an adult, the taste doesnt wear off and the price doesnt change!!

you might see me here!! Being loud and eating like a beast....."}
{"text":"Most of the barbecue item is nice to try and I recommence the lamb shashlik?chicken shashlik or everything about lamb. That is the traditional \"xin jiang \" style barbecue, not salty inside the meat but many cumin powder on sulface?if you love spicy, that is the place for you. This type of barbecue may be dry, taste many cumin, if you want that barbecue have a lot of juice, that I do not recommence.

For me, I love that type of barbecue, and not really enjoy the type of \" Korean style barbecue\"."}
{"text":"My new comfort food. Been here and back a couple of times, each time I've been quite happy. This little restaurant is a low-key, come-as-you-are type of place. It is also just the right amount of \"busy\", not crowded, food comes fast and hot, and staff generally leave you alone unless they are needed. I love coming here on cold, dreary days. The only downside is the parking situation on a busy day, they share a very small parking lot with a banquet hall and several other restaurants in the plaza, it can get quite crazy and full.

The foods are quite straight forward, most with picture accompanying the labels. The popular items are the skewers. Reasonably priced and quick to get to your table. We've tried the quail eggs, BBQ lamb Skewers, BBQ chicken bones (a better description would be chicken cartilages), and Eggplant. Each were well executed, meats are seasoned and tender with a nice mix of fat and lean pieces. I especially loved the lamb and Chicken bones skewers. 

The hot foods were great too. The stir-fried intestines were very tender and were seasoned with no off-putting smells or flavor. Though it was relatively fatty (much to be expected). The veggies added a much-needed break from the fatty morsels of intestine. The Tomato and egg noodle soup was a little bland, but nothing a sprinkle from the salt shaker can't fix. I'm not a big fan of the tomatoes soup but the noodles were perfectly al-dente and chewy. 

We tried the northeastern style noodle, and was pleasantly impressed. The noodles were interestingly clear and exuberantly chewy, served cold in a nice sweet and tangy sesame based sauce, and balance out with julienned cucumbers, carrots, wood-ear mushrooms, and shredded bean curd (the name escapes me, 5 min of googling and still blank). It is a cold noodle dish that is light, fresh and lively, perfect for a summery day. 

The lamb soup and the lamb offal soup were my shining stars. The broth is a milky base that is reminiscent of slow and long cooking of the bones. Coriander added a nice floral essence to the broth. The light yet full flavors extracted from this method is unmistakably pleasing. The only difference between the two soups boil down (hehehe, lame pun intended)to your preference of type of meat. The lamb and lamb offals were neither tough or gamey, I would travel here for just this if I ever feel under the weather.

Overall, a place for comfort food that won't put of a dent in your pocket. Some of the main dishes are a bit pricier but still reasonable. There's still much to explore on the menu and I intend to come back quite often. Well worth a try!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and there was no parking because there was a party at the banquet hall. Managed to wait for a parking space because it was 11pm and guests from the banquet hall were starting to leave. 
We went inside and were seated straight away. It wasn't too busy. We ordered a variety of the bbq sticks. We got lamb sticks(spicy and non spicy), chicken wings, sausage, mushrooms, corn, chicken carcass and chicken. We also ordered a portion of deep fried buns (man tau) that came with the condensed milk, for dipping. And a picked veg and fish soup dish. The bbq items we got were not that great. The lamb sticks had not much cumin and spices and the meat was dry and chewy. The other items were ok but all were lacking spices. We had gone to Harbin Bbq a few previous nights before, and their bbq food was way nicer. The wings were the cheap tiny wings too. 
Would not really go out of my way to come here again. Parking lot looks rough and sketchy and I've  had much better lamb sticks at other places."}
{"text":"The worst place ever. Bad food, terrible environment, high price. Will never go back. Can't believe they charge that much for that quality of food, service and environment. By far the worst restaurant ever in GTA!

By the way, the menu is false advertisement, actual price is doubled than what's shown in menu picture!"}
{"text":"okay, all i can say is W-O-W.

Seriously, this is the BEST, i repeat the BEST lamb skewer place I have been to. location is a bit random, the shop decor and parking lot is a bit sketch, but oh the food made it all worth it! 

I heard about this place from a friend on FB about the lamb, and boy am i glad i made my way out here. The lamb skewers are so good, you get this taste of cumin-y salty spicy goodness mixed with sizzling lamb flavors in every bite. it was off the hook! 

I also tried the fried fish, it's like an entire fish with head and tail and bones all fried and put on a platter. it was a bit hard to eat if you don;t like to get your hands dirty and pick around the bones. add some salt, the soft white fish has a nice crispy shell - 100% delishness.

The third dish i had was a chicken with dried chilli. the chicken was fried crispy (yes again fried), and the hot peppers makes the dish quite flavorful. 

In the end I ate a bit too much meat, and way too much fried stuff. The next day I had two trays of salad just to make up for all the meat I ate. the food is five star, the decor is why i'm giving it a four star. Everything's very minimal - please get better tables and maybe paint the walls. But don't let that stop you, go have some Lamb."}
{"text":"Favourite go-to skewer spot in Scarborough. Was recommended here by a friend. Spicy chicken and lamb skewers do not disappoint. Shrimp fried rice is a great side! Chill chicken is on point. No reservation needed. Beer tower is a great option for 4+ people."}
{"text":"I came in after midnight and there were a few people eating.

Lamb skewer: 2/5 dry
beef skewer: 2/5 dry
oyster: 3/5 alright
Garlic pea sprout shoots 5/5 good, but its hard to mess this up

I've had better skewers back home in California. I would only come back here if no other places are open (which was the case that night)

Overall: The sticks are meh. They close late though which is the prime reason they can have meh sticks and survive or maybe the non skewer stuff is way better.
Parking is fine. Cash only."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants for lamb skewers. I would come here mainly for their bbq skewers. But ever since they got more popular and busy, they seem to be giving smaller portions for their BBQ items. Service got worse and I feel very rushed when I am here. 

Service: the service is adequate. You don't come to get great service since it is a casual restaurant. Don't expect servers to check up on you. The servers are pretty quick in clearing dirty plates off your table though. Overall, the service isn't horrible but sometimes I do feel really rushed when I'm here. 

Food: I like the food here. It's a great spot for northern chinese food. They have a wide variety of lamb dishes here and most of their menu items are lamb offerings. I really like the lamb and tendon skewers. I also like their lamb dumplings. If you like lamb, I am sure you will find something here for you!

Xin Jiang is a decent place to eat. I recommend coming if you are nearby and you love spicy foods or Chinese BBQ."}
{"text":"What we had: Lamb liver soup, fried buns with condensed milk, lamb skewers, spicy salt fried chicken wings, chicken bones, Singapore fried noodles, chicken skewers, beef skewers, quail egg skewer, mushroom skewer, grilled corn, sausage skewer, beef tendon skewer, various rice dishes, stir fried lamb with green onion and cumin (they call it ziran sauce on the menu lol), pitchers of beer, various cold dishes/apps
(This was over several dozens of visits over the past few years, we don't eat THAT much.)

Taste: 9/10

All the BBQ meat skewers here taste amazing, especially the lamb.  The mix of spices and texture of meat is just right (even better if you like things spicy).  Most of the other appetizers are also very well done (mushroom skewers, grilled corn and fried buns with condensed milk), but nothing too special.  We really liked the spicy salt fried chicken wings, the sauce/rub they used was exceptional.

Out of the main course dishes, the singapore noodles were the best (it had a bit of curry taste to it), followed by the fried rice with chili chicken, which was very tender and flavorful.  Their other meat and vegetable dishes tasted mediocre at best. (otherwise taste would be rated 10/10).

Value: 9/10

2$ per skewer, 4-7$ for the appetizers, 9-12$ for main course dishes, 8 - 15$ for meat/vegetable dishes, 8$ pitchers.

**Average cost per diner: 17$ After Tax+Tip

Service/Convenience: 8/10

Fairly easy to find with the giant green sign. Parking isn't an issue most times during the day, however at night, there may be parking issues if the banquet hall right beside it is occupied.  Open until the early hours of the morning. Has outdoor seating. Service is quick.

Would go back? Regularly, both for meals and drinks.

Would recommend to friend? Yes, great hangout spot.

Similar places: None that we know of yet


**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza (16\") in one sitting."}
{"text":"Chill and low key late night spot. My friends and I went here for food and some drinks. It was nice and good. Got the beef stays, conch, and frog legs. Disclaimer: the frog legs was not bad but it was minimum. It did not really satisfied me. The food was fairly reasonable but they only accepted debit and cash.

This place did not really take me away. The service was ok. The servers kept sitting down perhaps it was a little slow but they were in their phones quite often. 

Overall, check this place out for some late night munchies and food."}
{"text":"Stopped by late evening (10pm-ish) on a Saturday evening after watching a movie when most places were closed.

Had a bit of difficulty finding a parking spot since there's a Banquet Hall inside the same plaza.

Walked into the restaurant and they were packed. Had to wait 5mins or so before they found us a table and cleaned up the previous patrons' mess.

We ordered 4 skewers each of BBQ Beef & Lamb, and Singapore style noodles.

The Beef Skewers came out within 5 mins, and the noodles came out after another 5 mins. But we had to wait about 15mins for the Lamb Skewers, and it was totally worth it.

The Beef was delicious, the noodles were good, but the lamb was out of the world! Yum!

Also helped that the servers spoke decent English.

We devoured the skewers but couldn't finish the noodles and asked to take it home. The server even offered to pack it for us, unlike most Asian places where they hand you a styrofoam box and a plastic carry-bag.

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"A-OK is pretty much the description that I would give to this restaurant. Decent Chinese BBQ skewers, but I'm still on the look out for better restaurants. 

Environment:
The restaurant is at a plaza at the McNicoll/Pharmacy intersection. The plaza reminds me of those old school Scarborough plaza that haven't been renovated for decades, and the restaurant reflects the same vibe. 
Like any BBQ restaurant, the whole entire space was filled with pungent BBQ smell, so be sure to wear something you don't mind getting dirty in and will immediately throw to the washing machine. I find the surface of the table to be slightly oily too, so it's not a good idea to put your phone on the table. 

Food:
The skewers here are on average $2 each, which isn't too bad. However, for the lamb skewers, the minimum order is 3 skewers. There are some BBQ seafood clams and oysters for $5 a piece, which I don't recommend anyone to get them because it's too overpriced for how little food you're getting. I find it funny how the vegetables are also $2 per skewer, which is basically the same price as the lamb.
In terms of flavour, the default flavour is spicy, so many sure to inform them when you place your order if you prefer mild. I've tried both flavours, and I prefer the mild flavour because I can actually taste the seasoning on the meat. The spicy flavour was too spicy to the point that my eyes were tearing up, my nose was runny, and I had to keep chucking water.
One thing that really stood out was their massive beer tower. For only $10 you can get 2 litres of beer and they would serve it to you in a World Cup trophy shaped container, which looked absolutely amazing. However, the beer wasn't very good as it tasted very diluted......

Service:
Typical Asian restaurant service, which you can call anyone who happens to walk by to place your order. It felt understaffed on the Friday night dinner hour when we were here, and they made a lot of mistakes sorting through our bill. 

My bill came down to $16 after tax and tips, but for my friends who ordered the seafoods their bills were well over $20."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars to 4stars. The service can be lacking, usually due to some language barriers. Some staff speak Mandarin and some speak Canto, and they all speak enough English to take your order. This isn't a place you're going to get good suggestions about what to eat, but half the fun is trying it all out. They have things like chicken heart and chicken kidney skewers for the more adventurous, and the standard lamb and beef skewers that you can order spicy or non-spicy. I haven't found the skewers to be dry but they can be quite salty and spicy - which goes will with the beer. The draft beer is very cheap at $8 a pitcher and $10 for the tower, but it is a VERY light beer. They also do cheap bottled beer. 
Great place for a big group so you can order all kinds of dishes to try. It's loud and busy in here usually. Don't skip the deep fried buns with condensed milk for dessert, they really finish off the meal! 
Also, cash and debit only here."}
{"text":"If you work near this restaurant, go there for lunch! They have a big selection of lunch menu and the portion is HUGE. Me and colleague usually order 1 dish from the lunch menu and 1 lamb skewer each, and that's enough to stuff both of us."}
{"text":"Xin Jiang is located in the plaza at the northwest corner of Pharmacy and McNicoll, in a plaza that looks more ghetto than it really is. The neighbourhood isn't bad at all, but there definitely should be more lighting to make this plaza more pleasing.

I came here with my family on a Sunday night, and it wasn't too busy. The employees speak Mandarin and English, so no canto unfortunately. The menu here is quite extensive, but since it's a barbecue restaurant I focused mainly on the BBQ skewers, and wanted to compare the experience here with Yang's down by Finch and Midland.

We ordered the BBQ lamb skewer, BBQ sausage, BBQ squid feeler, BBQ corn, and BBQ garlic skewer. I was honestly only impressed with the squid feeler (aka squid tentacles) and garlic skewer, but with the prices I didn't really expect much in terms of standards. The lamb skewer was extremely dry, the sausage was the Chinese sausage kind except it was dry as well, and the BBQ corn didn't have a heavy BBQ taste to it. Their squid was very good though, and the garlic skewer was also surprisingly tasty.

Service was hit and miss; it was hard to get the employees to describe what some of the food are, and believe me you may need to for some of the items. Personally I had a better experience with Yang's at Finch/Midland, and despite the higher prices (and busier atmosphere) there, I'll likely return there and not here."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while. And have been craving BBQ all day. So we decided to come for some BBQ skewers. We were really hungry so we put partial orders in first. While deciding what else to get, food started coming. We immediately changed our mind about ordering more! We came for BBQ NOT DEEP FRIED ITEMS THAT's labeled as BBQ! Not coming back"}
{"text":"Unpretentious, delicious, inexpensive and quick service. If you like spicy food, you will like this place. 

The lamb skewers are among the best I had in Toronto. I also had the chicken bones, Singapore fried noodles, barbecued squid tentacles, fish with bean sprouts and peppers. You also should try the cucumbers and eggs dish. 

A place to go with friends and family has it isn't the most glamorous of the settings, but don't get lured by appearances, you'll get a great meal."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to grab lamb skewers. They're juicy, salty, and full of flavour. The other skewers are good too, but the lamb is what you should come for.

They're open till 3am, so that's a plus for you night owls. Check them out if you're in the area or have a hankering for some skewers. 

Note: This is embarrassing... I just realized that the original review I wrote for xin jiang was the wrong one. THIS is the correct location. Pharmacy & mcnicol!"}
{"text":"Such a good spot for fried tasty food and cheap beer. I can't emphasize enough how cheap the beer was. Take a look at my pictures for the beer prices as of 2017. A pitcher for $8 (1.5L) is absurd and the beer tower for $10 (2L) is a steal. 

The food is good - I'm no connoisseur of northern Chinese food/skewers but I've had enough to know how important the spices are. The key is to not focus on the salt and more so on the spices involved - lots of cumin and chili powder. We ordered a pitcher of beer, meatless chicken (MEATLESS so it's just bones and some scraps of meat), lamb skewers, beef tendon skewers, squid, spicy popcorn chicken.

All were excellent choices but the worst out of them was the beef tendon. It just wasn't a traditional choice to get BBQ skewer and it tasted weird with the chewy consistency. Lamb skewers are a must and it seems like the meatless chicken for $4 is a popular choice (all the tables around us ordered it). I would highly recommend the popcorn style chicken; super crispy and tasty.

All the spices, salt, and seasoning will dehydrate you. Thank goodness for the cheap beer. I can see myself returning for cheap beer and a savoury bite."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years now. This restaurant is inexpensive and quick. The food is quite delicious and spicy which is great! The best part is that their beers are VERY CHEAP. 

This place is great for a quick bite accompanied by some cheap beers. Domestic beer cost $3.50 a bottle and imported beer is just a bit more. Their pitchers are even cheaper but the quality of the beer itself is mediocre. I highly recommend the bbq lam ribs because it is very tender and the flavour really hits as you get into the meat. The restaurant also has a variety of skewers which makes for a quick snack.

The only thing that I'm concerned about is the actual sanitation of the restaurant. You're able to catch a glimpse of the kitchen while walking in the restaurant and to the washroom and it does not look too clean. I remember one time I was here, I found a lot of bugs flying around. 

Otherwise, the service was good and food and drinks are great."}
{"text":"Lamb skewers, lamb skewers, lamb skewers. Out of all of Scarborough, nothing compares to the chunky, succulent, juicy, tender lam peices that xin jiang offers! Their BBQ selection is good enough to have just skewers by it self, but they do lack side dishes that will accommodate skewers. 

For the food adventure goers, Xin Jiang has frog legs!  
For the party people, They offer $7 pitchers! Of course it's not the big branded ones like Molson, but it taste pretty good and get you drunk for cheap.

The best part is they open until 2 am! So you don;t have to suck up paying $7 pints at jack astors just because you forgot to run to the beer store~"}

We got lamb skewers (obviously), enoki mushroom and bean curd skewers, spicy squid, tofu with preserved egg (also one of my fav dishes here- it's perfect to balance out the spicy skewers!!!), and a fried rice. 
The bean curd skewers were surprisingly tasty! 
You can choose your spice level for all the skewers, spicy is the way to go for the full flavour and authentic experience!"}
{"text":"Xin Jiang is an unpretentious little restaurant where you go and eat.  It's not a place where you go to admire the physical beauty of the restaurant.   
So, the food.  There are varieties to choose  from.  It's mostly known for the skewers, but you can order entrees as well.  The skewers are cooked for you,  and on average they ranged about $2 to $3 per skewer.  It's easy to order different skewers so the cost adds up fast.  My friends and i tried different ones such as beef, lamb, Shrimps and frog legs to name a few.  My favourite skewer is the mushrooms - so flavourful and juicy.  We also ordered dishes of fish, rice, and soup.  Everything was washed down with beer that was in a container that looked like  World Cup trophy.  I would say that the food was ok.  They were mostly spicy.
The service was ok as well.  We were given little slips of paper to write down what we wanted and the servers brought us our orders and it's that basic. There was a mistake in our bill as they charged us an extra bowl of rice.  So keep tab of what you ordered because it can get confusing."}
{"text":"Bad try for this restaurant,no service still cost me 10 percent tips and food there was not from xin jiang in china,really not good ,but really expensive,i wont go there anymore,plz trust me ,i dont know why this restaurant  still exist,?"}
{"text":"Cold dish was better compared to other staff. We couldn't finish everything cuz they were too dry,hard and not fresh,especially the chicken heart and lamb kidney. Wanna say chicken wings was apparently deep fried instead of BBQ, taste nothing else but savoury. Fish is not fresh, so taste bitter. Food is too pricey, not worth at all."}
