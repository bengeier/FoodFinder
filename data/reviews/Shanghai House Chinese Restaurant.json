{"text":"Yes, the eat-in restaurant is dingy but the food is really good. We had take out General Tao chicken (perfectly light sauce and not goopy--I feel like a traitor saying this but it was better than my fav Chilli Chicken House), beef fried rice (really good with nice sized pieces of beef) and lemon chicken (yum).   Will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu. The owner was super friendly and I like that this restaurant is family-owed. Want to give this 4.5 stars but not sure how."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Chinese food one night and decided to take away from this restaurant at 10pm at night. Food was prepared relatively fast and at pick-up, we were also given a discount for paying cash (credit cards are available though). Place was really quiet but maybe because it was already outside of dinner time and situated with shops that were already closed for the night. I agree with the other reviewers that the interior of the restaurant is a little meh. Food was okay. The portions on the combo 3 were quite generous. The beef fried noodles and the sweet and sour chicken were well received. The spicy beef and the vegetable dish tasted much of the same though except that one was spicy and the other was not. All in all, not great but reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food in missiauga. Order delivery. The beef taste like dog food..fried 5 spice chicken was very oily and had a taste like they never change their oil in years..had to threw everything out...don't waste your money here..its not fresh and taste like process food."}
{"text":"Just get their 5 spice chicken and hot braised chicken! And now I found their amazing Chinese sausage fried rice."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!   This place is an institution! Located in a tiny strip mall at Burnhampthorpe and Tomken you can easily miss the place if you aren't paying attention to it.  Do yourself a favor and take a visit.   The decor is straight up 70's, the washroom is awful, but the food.. oh the food,  Yes the food is heavy, and sticks to the gut but boy is it good for an indulgence.   Order a braised chicken dish and thank me later. Spectacular!"}
{"text":"This place is our Go-To place as they have a good selection of Meat dishes. Yes, meat, as other Chinese restaurants provide far less protein that this place.   However, I've noticed over the years that their portions are starting to get smaller bit by bit (i.e. less meat and more veggies).  We always take out - never eat in.   Paying cash saves you some additional money which is a great deal."}
{"text":"Average food, same as any cheap overgreased chinese restaurant that caters to non-asians. Also horrifically dirty...  Came here with friends since it seems to be a cult favourite even amongst asians (no idea why) and it did not live up to the hype.  Cheap though."}
{"text":"I am traveling and wanted to get something to \"take away\" while I worked in the hotel.  Ordered the Spring Roll which I found was lightly breaded and fried. VERY tasty and there is a nice mixture/balance between crunchy and chewy. There are two larger (10cm/4\") rolls per order  My Red Oil Dumpling with Chinese Noodle was surprisingly spicy (I LOVE spicy and even though it is marked by a chili pepper in the menu, I did not expect that it would be as spicy as it was -- now for me, this is a good thing). The wide noodles around the meat as well as the more vermicelli-like thinner noodles that accompanied the dish were excellent. This is served in a 20 cm round tin with a paper plate top, which did a great job of staying hot (not warm) until long after I returned and started eating.  The last dish that we had was pork fried rice. What I found especially nice is that the fried rice was not greasy, it might even be considered by some to be \"dry\" -- but I like the fried rice with other dishes in place of \"white rice\", so I found it quite delightful. Plentiful cubed pork mixed in with the expected vegetables. Also served in the same size container as the Dumpling dish.  The \"ambiance\" of the restaurant is more of a \"diner\" than a 4-star restaurant. This appears to be a \"family run\" business that caters to its local clientele. The host appeared to take great pains to get orders the way the customer were expecting, not just to match the menu (I sat reading while I waited for my order to be prepared) and appreciated the care demonstrated. Located in a strip mall, there is adequate parking although one may enter only on the west side and exit on the east side of the strip.  I heartily recommend Shanghai House for Chinese Food lovers."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall Chinese food. This place might need a bit of a reno. Tons of options, tasty, and reasonable. We usually go for Lemon chicken or braised chicken. Both are good, they always offer more sauce if we want more. Most of the time they allow us to swap item from the combo meal. Friendly service, family owned."}
{"text":"Price performer, had the 5 spice chicken and fried rice and it was great.   Amazingly heaping plate of food for $4.90, they should really charge more for it."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years, since lunch time in elementary school circa 1995-96. For the money, I have no complaints. The food is of good quality and tastey. The lunch specials for 5-7$ are a great value; I usually get the lemon chicken with house special fries rice (mix of pork, beef, chicken , and shrimp in the rice), the beef with broccoli and house friend rice, or sehchuan noodles. Sinner is more expensive, but the portions are greater. My only complaint is the tacky 1980s typical Chinese resturuant interior, but as long as they prices remain low, I am cool with it."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very authentic. No msg or other filler that makes you feel off. Service pleasant. Dinning area is nothing special so be prepared to enjoy the food not the ambience."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food I've had in Mississauga.  It is a bit greasy, not in a gross way, but in an extremely yummy way.  The food here is simply amazing. While their noodle dishes are a bit different, they are okay.  Some people don't like them but I don't mind them personally.  The fried rice here is the best I've ever had.  It has a delicious smoky flavour which you never get with other places. There isn't one dish here I've been disappointed with.   Must haves:  - Any fried rice - 150 - braised chicken - 25 - sweet and sour pork - if you're a fan of ss pork, then you will love theirs - 156 - stuffed eggplant szechuan - give it a try, even if you don't like eggplant - Moo Shu (pork, chicken, beef, or veg) - really good!  give it a shot   The restaurant itself doesn't seem like the best place to sit in and eat at, but I only get take-out from here anyways.  One last point - if you want your food fast, order from here. Even if you get like 8-10 items, it's always ready within 15-20 minutes.  Nice change compared to many other Chinese restaurants that take much much longer."}
{"text":"Really good shrimp fried rice, not good General Tso Chicken.  Pictures is the Chicken - yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food. This restaurant is in a little strip mall and the restaurant is a little outdated but the food was excellent. The server was pleasant and the food came quick. They have more of a take out business it seems but there were a few tables occupied. The smell of the food was nice when we walked in and the take out customers were coming in often which is a good sign.  It was a little warm inside but I guess it wasn't air conditioning season yet. The guy there said he would turn in on for us, but we didn't ask. Over all. Great food! Good price too. General Tsao chicken was awesome. Couldn't get enough of it! Eat in or take out, I'm sure you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"The food was fresh , tasty and definitely worth it !!! Great spot to hit up, one of my favourite s in missisauga"}
{"text":"Grabbed take out from here on the strength of the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed!  Shanghai reminds me of the old style Chinese restaurants I grew up with.  Low on decor but high on serving tasty food.  The 5 spice chicken as everyone has commented is excellent, very flavorful and the sauce when mixed with steamed rice is delicious I enjoyed the bits of crunchy cabbage sprinkled in the dish.  I didn't need to add seasoning any of the dishes we ordered.  Prices are cheap compared to other restaurants in the area.  I probably would not dine in here although the tables and chairs appeared tidy I would stick with take out."}
{"text":"Buffet super poor ! It comes out being $10.14. But since there super cheap they don't fill out the hot table and don't put food out unless you ask and they see a lot of people. A lot being 3. I've been here 5 times because I'm a student but still not good"}
{"text":"This is the first time we ordered from here. Since moving to Mississauga I have been trying to find a decent Chinese restaurant that delivers. Checked out yelp and found this place . I called and was told due to the weather they are backed up about an hour and said it would be faster to pick up. He asked for my number and he will call me back in 10 minutes. He called me back. I decided  to pick up our order and give them a try. The guy on the phone was super friendly and helped me pick some dishes to try. I'm so happy we did. Best Chinese food I have had in a long time. The honey garlic ribs were moist and actually had meat on them. They were so good. Even my 3 year old ate them. She loved the noodle dish. Everything was fresh and tasty. This is my new go to for Chinese take out. I would have given a 5 star but the veggie spring rolls were to big and greasy. I will try the egg rolls next time. If you have not tried Shanghai you should. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love the sheer drapes for the windows. A full menu is on the outside window, so you won't feel trapped to order when you get to the counter. Once inside, the pictures on the wall, add to the feeling of being in a Chinese restaurant. This has got to be the only place that proudly states; no MSG. I have been to many places, including grocery stores and they all have MSG. and haven't got the courtesy to say/write as such. I have never eaten in but notice that the plates all have matching patterns, not just plain white. Even when it's the hottest day of the year, \"Peter\" the owner will greet everyone with a smile ! I used to call for pick-up on Sundays but since my dog died in 2013, I can't go here without thinking of my dog, jumping in the car for our usual Sunday night supper pick-ups. Don't forget, they have decent lunch specials.--update as of today, Nov.05.2016, I still go here, three years after my doggie died, and am relieved the place is as I described it above and still the only place that has no MSG."}
{"text":"So far so good. Mongolian Beef and Shrimp Fried Rice. Couple of soups. Take out. Was fast preparing. We might be new regulars."}
{"text":"How have I not tried/heard of this place? Thanks to yelp I've finally found a great take out and Chinese delivery joint! This place is clearly dated and I would never dine inside... But!!! They serve hot, fresh, delicious greasy Americanized Chinese food. I've been able to try their hot braised chicken which was very good, lemon chicken, pork and chicken fried rice, beef broccoli, spareribs, chicken wings, spring rolls, 5 spice fried chicken WOW and their chicken balls. All were great, flavourful and fresh! No complaints! They also have very affordable lunch specials! It gets busy at lunch sometimes so arrive early!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. Was craving some good Chinese food that delivers. Ordered the dinner for 2 combo. Fried rice, 2 spring rolls and 2 other dishes. Was plenty of food for 2 adults. The man at restaurant told me it might take longer since they were super busy but it came in about 30-35min. Everyrhu n g was very tasty and filling. Will definitely order again and recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"A giant ripoff. For 14.10 for the Sampler I was expecting a little more food. I'm a skinny guy it doesn't take much to feed me but I was hungry after having left.   So food meh, but price boo."}
{"text":"To put it nicely, the food was a disappointment at best. The chow mein as well as the fried rice both looked and tasted like they were prepared the day before and just heated up in the microwave on order. Some parts of the chow mein and rice were cold, while others were hot and unevenly reheated, and the quality and freshness of the ingredients was very poor. The food from this hole in this wall may be cheap, but save your money - There are far better places to get quality Chinese food prepared properly and with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Had to update my review just 'coz it just keeps getting better.    Great portion for great price!! I go here for lunch, and I swear I get the best deals. Had to order five-spiced chicken ($ 6.49? Or $6.99 I believe) includes already a fried rice!   To top it off, I also order CRAB RAGOON. Which is pretty much a cheese wonton with crab & shrimp in it. 5pcs for $4.99, and they were massive and flavourful!!!"}
{"text":"Been ordering delivery/take out from Shanghai House since 2004.  They are a family run business and deliver consistent, delicious, quality food every single time.  Staff are friendly and attentive.  Definitely try the Hot Braised Chicken if it's your first visit and you like a little bit of spice.  I also enjoy the curry chicken wings and lemon chicken.  Pricing is very reasonable for what you get.  The dining room is nothing special, this place is all about the food."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and needed Anne's go to Chinese spot for those lazy nights. Came on yelp and looked up all the Chinese delivery in the area. This one has one of the best reviews for Chinese food, so we gave it a go.  Calling was easy, no communication barrier so we weren't worried about getting our order or location right. We were warned ahead it may be around an hour wait, because they were very busy (which can be a good sign right?!) We ordered the chicken chop suey, two spring rolls, chicken fried rice and chicken balls. We initially were trying to order a combo but the dinner for 2 didn't include veggies nor substitutions.   The order came at around 1h time (as predicted). It was hot and fresh and came up to just over $26.00 after tax. Upon first appearance it the rice wasn't dry, had lots of chicken in both the rice and chop suey. Food was oily but it's expected. Everything tastes great. I only wish the chicken balls were a little fluffier inside and the convo options were better. Overall great experience, we will be ordering again in the future! Would recommend!   Food 4/5 Value 5/5 Overall experience 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but they were not even close to hitting the mark. I must have visited during an off day, or perhaps the regular chef was away.  Mark1 I was lured by Ted B's mention of \"good smokey\" flavor.. this flavor is hard to achieve without a screaming hot wok seasoned to perfection.  The Fried rice dish I had was missing that elusive smokey flavor.. but it was not terrible just meh.. .   Mark2 The crispy honey ginger beef :  a) Not crispy at all, but rather mushy.   b) No hint of honey to be found, but seemed very salty.   c) Not even a whiff of ginger   Mark3 The 5 spice chicken  a) Could not taste any spices besides salt.. there was no 5 spice flavor  b) rubbery chicken.   All an all I am going to bin the 5 Spice chicken, and Crispy honey ginger beef... Head out to buy something else to go along with the run of the mill Fried rice.   Sorry, Shanghai House. I was hoping for better."}
{"text":"I can't sum it up any better than G.K., Shanghai House really is an institution. Anyone who grew up in the Applewood area knows what I'm talking about; this place is notorious in the local area. For this reason it would've never crossed my mind to write it a Yelp review. BUT, considering I'm on a role today, I just happened to come across the page and it only has a few reviews; I shall tender my experience of many, many years of contact with Shanghai.  -   SUPER cheap, this is a lunch spot for high school kids as a result. (so as a side-note, you may want to avoid 12-2 on weekdays)  -   Food is great; braised chicken, spare ribs are really popular- but anything is good  -   Don't be turned off by the minimal setting, and the fact that the washroom feels like the backdrop in a horror scene.  -   Just go, and be rest assured that you are eating in the best Chinese food place in the area."}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away on the top right side of Burnhamthorpe Rd E & Tomken Rd when you head east on Burnhamthorpe Rd E.   To my surprise it was completely empty when I arrived for some take out at 1:30PM.  I ordered the Five Spice Chicken and it is amazing. Loved it and will definitely come back to try other menu items.  The decore leaves much to be desired but you don't come back for that, you come back for the food."}
