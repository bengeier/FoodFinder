{"text":"I find Charmes Cochinchine is a great place to get lunch. Huge parking lot, lots of seating places in a location that is well decorated, this resto can hit the spot for Vietnamese cuisine lovers.

I went with a huge bowl of Tonkinese Soup and my friend with a Pad Thai. Both were very good with a solid price tag that makes it worth your time. The service wasn't exactly friendly but on-point and quick. So no complains there.

My bowl of soup was full of meat and tasty. The side dish of mint, lemon grass and lime was nice.

All in all, I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Very good authentic Vietnamese food. Nice prices. It's a bring your own wine. Will go again."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant vietnamien apportez votre vin comme on retrouve un peu partout. Sauce aux arachides manque un peu de goût. Service rapide et courtois."}
{"text":"I came here feeling Asian food and remembering from a friend that he mentioned there was another Vietnamese place on le Corbusier (Chez Pham being the other).  I can't tell you how happy I am to find this place.  Looking at their menu I had noticed what I consider \"Quebec-style\" Vietnamese.  I call this stir fry's in different formats.  I had asked if they had Pho or Vermicelli Bun-style dishes.  The server mentioned they had Pho it was labeled \"Tonkinese soup\".  Ordered this up and I would give it a 3.5/5.  Reason being is I have tried better and I have tried worse... but at lease they brought it with the authentic condiments. not a super deep-rich flavour but not too salty and bland also!  With this ordered a Viet-style iced coffee and they delivered on this end!  Super good!  $9.99 for the Pho!  Score!  

It's some awesome to have a more authentic Vietnamese resto near my work office and not too far from my home!  There are so many of these Quebec Style Vietnamese restaurants that just serve up friend noodles (Nid au poulet) with vegetables or different grilled meat with rice etc.  They do offer up this type of fare as well but I try to avoid it and go for more authenticity!  

Now if I could only go find a place to get an avocado shake this would make my day!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and I had their noodle soup (Pho).....OMG!!! It was so good.   
Soupe cochinchine is what I got.....

The broth, the vegetables, the meat, everything was just done right...perfect blend of flavors and large size, enough to fill me up !

Located in Laval, in a strip mall, this is a great find if you are in the area...."}
{"text":"Went there with the in-laws for Mother's Day.

The food seems to be hit or miss depending on what you take. I had the table d'hôte with chicken pad thai. The soup was ok. The imperial rolls were delicious. The pad thai was a big disappointment though. There was no hint of tamarind in the sauce, and to me a pad thai isn't one without the sweet and sour taste of tamarind. It was basically rice noodles, undercooked veggies, chicken, fried egg and soy sauce. We shared a plate of general thai chicken. It was great.

Others in the group seemed to enjoy their plates (pho soup, curry chicken, grilled beef).

Service was ok, somewhat expeditive but that is expected in that kind of restaurant.

I would go back, but I would avoid the pad thai and I would stick with vietnamese fare."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best food I have had in Laval. The atmosphere was warm and friendly with young and old adults enjoying their dinner. Service was excellent and flavours were tasty and authentic. Bring your own wine and they will serve it for your which is very nice touch. I have bookmarked this restaurant under Thai however several Asian dishes are available. Try the sticky rice with shrimp and chicken."}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance from my hotel that I was staying.  Was really excited to see such great reviews, and it's within few blocks.  So after checking in to my hotel, I went there around 6p on a week night.  The place was about half full.  I was quickly seated for 1.  The interior looked nice and had table cloth...upgrade from typical Vietnamese restaurants that I've experienced.

The waiter brought water and menu, but then he left.  There were 2 of them, and one of them appeared to be the owner perhaps.  As the menu is mostly in French with simple English, it took me some time to decide.  The food is more of an Asian fusion than the typical Vietnamese restaurant.  But during this whole time, I was ignored and the waiter never came back to check on me until I waive him over, which was about 10min later.  Again, this place is only about half full, so it wasn't as if he's busy.

When he came over, the order was taken quickly, which I ordered the basic shrimp spring roll and the beef pho (I think they only had 2 or 3 different type of pho, and rest is other stuff that I have no idea).  My food came within 10min, so that was fine.  Overall, I thought the flavor was very basic and had some sort of shrimp or seafood taste (probably more MSG).  Again, this is supposed to be beef pho.  I ended up putting some hoisin sauce and hot sauce as the soup didn't have much depth to it.  To be honest, the food was OK, about a 2-3 stars.  Reason I've decided on 2 star is due to lack of service.  

Now, this part I do have to explain a little.  Again, there were 2 waiters working.  One was quiet, and the other was more flamboyant and talkative as he was laughing and joking with several other customers.  But when he came over to take my order, it was short and quiet.  Now, you could say I was probably the only non-speaking French customer there, or that I was the only Asian customer?  So maybe he doesn't like other Asians or me personally?  Either way, I certainly didn't feel very welcome there and felt discriminated.  When I asked for the bill, the waiter told me to just go to the front desk.  Once again, it was the same cold treatment w/o saying thank you, a smile, or any other gesture.  

So yes, I can see how others may have given this place a high review, but I guess I don't fit the profile of their typical customer."}
