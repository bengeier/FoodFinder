{"text":"We ordered a pizza and wings for pickup to tonight and were told it would be a half hour. My husband drove up to pick it up and they hadn't even started the order. They then told him it would take another half hour to make our order he left and we ordered elsewhere. This was our first time trying them out and I can't say I have any interest in going back."}
{"text":"I have had the spaghetti with mushrooms, baked ziti, fried mushrooms, mozzarella sticks, chicken bacon ranch pizza, hot wings, BBQ wings and pepperoni pizza, cheesecake and ALL have been amazing!! The delivery is fast, the food is always hot, and the driver is always nice and respectful. I love this place."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite pizzerias for a while.  It's as close to u can get to jersey pizza.  There are a few other places that are good too, but luckys rocks!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10 years, and have never been disappointed. The pizza and wings here are great, and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Have been going there for years and always the same, Friendly owners and amazingly consistent quality food. Recently starting asking for my pizza extra crispy OMG !! How have I gone so far in life without this..... Absolutely perfect. Check them out you won't be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"We tried NYPD tonight for the 1st time, I wish I would have been able to give more than 5 stars. From the time we walked in we were served in a courteous and timely fashion. Our waitress, Courteney M., was helpful, cheerful, and attentive. The food was great, all and all the experience was excellent. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I'm from New York and moved out here a few years ago I absolutely love this place the family  who work there are so friendly and make you feel like it's there home very hard workers the food is excellent my family came out to visit from New York and wanted to try a pizza place out since they weren't satisfied with the other pizzarias around here I took them to tailgaters, us pizza etc. they hated it thank god There is Luckys my family loved the place.All those other pizzerias are nasty and cheep cheese you can tell the cheese here is expensive like they say it is everything there is handmade I come here at least 4 times a week or even more it's like I live here at Luckys oh yea  try the wings as well you gonna absolutely love it nice and crispy and big wings not little tiny wings you get at the other places I recommend it to everyone to come here and try there pizza there wings the pasta they have calzones cold frosted pitchers of beer philly steak subs grilled on the grill to perfection cold subs better then their subway store next to them and they also have great lunch specials and very good cheap prices you can bring your family and not waist allot of money and have great excellent food come down and try this place you won't regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Order all the time, the food is great, the price is good. Try the pasta sometime, the lasagna is awesome!"}
{"text":"I looked up delivery pizza on Yelp.  Among the many places, Lucky's Pizza was listed.  It is relatively close to where I was staying and has at least one good review, and so I called.  The phone was curtly answered, and I identified myself. I then asked for an order to be delivered.   The immediate reply was \"we don't delivery, buddy\"!    I was shocked.  I then asked this person what he just said? He repeated it.   I asked if he worked there or was an owner or manager?  He said he worked there.  I then said that \"you never speak to a customer in that way\".   His reply:  \"Do you think I give a shit\"?!  He then hung up. 

Rest assured that if this is the kind of attitude that is tolerated by management, the quality and likely the safety, of their food is highly questionable."}
{"text":"We've been ordering here for about a year.  Lately we said wow, the pizza and wings is better than ever.  Not so last Saturday.  The pizza crust was soft and soggy, the wings were barely cooked and no where near crispy and good.  Sorry to say I wrote a great review in the past.  Not sure we'll order from here again.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"if you want true New York Pizza this is the place to eat. There Pizza is thin like NY and really tastes great and the Gravy & Cheese is very tasty. The staff and owner are very friendly. I have been going there for 5 years and have not had a bad meal at all. If you are a New Yorker you really need to go to Lucky's Pizza"}
{"text":"So I ordered a 2 liter soda, fries, wings, pasta, and a pizza. I got the order in 2 pizza boxes and a bag. I had my boyfriend check the order because I had to catch up on laundry (yay). He told me there was 2 pizzas and a salad. So I let my hangriness take over and called the restaurant. The guy who answered (I believe the owner or manager) asked if I opened the boxes and I said yes because I assumed my boyfriend did. Long story short... My boyfriend didn't open the boxes... The fries, wings, and pizza were in the large pizza box. But no soda to be found :( The person who answered the phone at Lucky's said he would add an extra 2 liter next time. I feel like a complete idiot and felt like I owed a 5 star review to Lucky's pizza for still being patient with me and ending the call on a good note (: 

Oh and I made my boyfriend go to the store and get soda for making me look crazy lol ;)"}
{"text":"Really good, authentic New York style pizza place owned by real New Yorkers. They have that crispy crust and good sauce, which are both very important to me in pizza. Also great specials. I recommend it and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Had Lucky's pizza for the first time today. I got the daily special and the stuffed shells. I honestly didn't think it was going to be a big portion. But to my surprise it was more than enough, they included a side salad and also a garlic bread with it! The cheese slice pizza was really, really good!! Glad my coworker recommended. I will be back for sure!! The staff is also so friendly and welcoming that's a plus too!!"}
{"text":"My sons favorite place. Family ran always friendly and great service. He like the hot wings and out garlic on them. Chicken Parm is outstanding. Hot subs are my daughters favorite. If they would change the channel of CNN! Lol!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and awesome wings! The staff is friendly and funny. The food is always good and very reasonable. Even during the busy days/nights, you never have to wait for very long. They also have good deals on pizza and wings."}
{"text":"The best Pizza in town! Great people! Family owned restaurant. I have come to this place for years and never had bad experience everrrr!!If you want to try the New York style pizza in AZ!, this is the place to test!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. I wouldn't say it is anything too special, but for $4.50 for the two piece lunch special, the value is definitely there. Service was fast and adequate, and the food was hot and fresh. 

As a side note, they do make calzones and sandwiches, so there are options available."}
{"text":"Great wings and the hot sandwich was delish!  Definitely going back again. ."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was pretty good, but nothing mind blowing. Until I had the mushroom, pepperoni, meatball pizza. AMAZING! Plus, we loved their pizza deal: 1 large pizza & 20 wings for $20 (if I remember correctly). I actually really liked their wings & I'm not a big wing person. And their lunch special looked pretty cheap. 

My favorite by far though was the cannoli. It's the only dessert they have, and it's the best cannoli I've had. Super crunchy and fresh & sprinkled with cinnamon, you can't go wrong with the cannoli."}
{"text":"Smelly Feet. After seeing multiple positive reviews we decided to try Lucky's.  From our experience we will not be going back. We ordered two relatively easy pizzas to go: 1 large pepperoni & 1 large sausage/mushroom. Both had an extremely strange smell which we weren't sure if it was from a) the box b) the pizza oven or c) the pizza itself. The closest thing I can describe the smell to is smelly feet.  Maybe Lucky's had an unlucky night but until I have a craving for stinky feet we'll stay away."}
{"text":"Best pizza here in surprise. Lived in NY for 8 years and this is the closest we've found here. This is our go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Ordered an extra large pizza and twenty wings. First of all even with the special you end up spending $35, which is a little over priced. It is even more over priced when you consider that the pizza arrived cold and with burned crust, the wings were cold, and they messed up the order. Even small things like checking boxes on their order screen requesting peppers and parm and ranch, not blue cheese, seem to be to much for them to sort out as I got no peppers or parm and you guessed it, blue cheese. It was very disappointing and I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"for dinner really not that great to be honest.  the pizza at tailgater's was so much better.  

for the most part I would pass on coming here again.  had 2 pieces out of a large took the rest and gave to a homeless panhandlers.  

  pizza was bland, greasy , and doughy.  

I forgot one of the first rules of trying somewhere new check out the bathroom when you first walk in, if it's not clean time to leave.  needless to say the bathroom was like a truck stop."}
{"text":"I like supporting family businesses. This place has great wings. The pizza is good but not a fan of the cheese. The crust can improve too. Overall it's good enough to continue to go back for more. The prices are ok. They have good ongoing specials, but I'd like to see different specials or deals. They don't have as many deals as their competitors.  Definitely worth a try if you are looking to get pizza from a new place."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza wings and sandwiches.Large slices of thin ny style pizza.Im a 3 time a week visitor love to watch games on one of the 4 big screen tvs.A pleasure to see a nice family owned business where everyone is super nice.You won't regret."}
{"text":"They're not skimpy with the toppings. Ordered olives and mushrooms and got a sea of veggies.  The cheese is good quality and the toppings taste fresh. About 16 bucks for a half and half large pizza (and I do mean large!) fed us all four with some left over. Will try the wings next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! I brought my family in there last week and there food is phenomenal. True New York style food pizza, wings, pastas everything luckys has to offer is amazing. Family owned and great service and hospitality. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and wings here. Cozy \"hole in the wall\" pizza joint that has pretty tasty food and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I ordered two pepperoni pizzas, the crust taste like cardboard, the sauce is flavorless, it was very very greasy, and on top of all that it was over priced. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Great pizza. We went there last week and it was really good. Decent prices too!"}
{"text":"Lucky's is the real deal for NY style pizza. If you don't like that style, don't eat it and then trash it in a review.  They are friendly and quick.  The wings are great because they deep fry them instead of baking them.  Makes a huge difference.  Awesome place."}
{"text":"Moving from New England to Surprise was a challenge when it came to pizza and we've tried many different places. Lucky's is the place. The pizza and wings are very good. We continue to try different places from time to time but Lucky's has won out. Looks like a family run business and they are friendly. The cheese pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"A few years a moved from surprise to Maine and spent 2 years dreaming about a pie from Luckys. We eventually moved back and the first place we went to was luckys to get a broccoli pie. Delish. Now I'm that we moved to the east coast again, I'm dreaming about a broccoli pie and one with green peppers and olives because they don't make em like Luckys here on the north shore. I'll be back soon and will be sure to stop by for my favorite pie."}
{"text":"I am a Pizza Snob. I have actually been driving about 10 miles round trip to get quality pizza. ..until now!   Lucky's on Cactus will be my pizza place from now on. The NY Style stuffed pizza was PERFECT!   The toppings were succulent and the crust was amazing. In addition,  they had made a small and understandable mistake when billing my card, so the young man that took my order actually came to my house PERSONALLY to explain what happened and deliver my pizza. How refreshing to deal with a business that chooses to own their mistakes and go out of their way to make it right. BRAVO Lucky's on Cactus!   You have earned my business....and that is saying ALOT!"}
{"text":"I love everything there from pizza to wings. My favorite has to be the pepperoni roll. My whole family loves it!"}
{"text":"If there was a Button for 0 stars that's what I would rate them I made a yelp account just for this that's how bad of an experience I had.

While I was there I noticed a worker in the back picking his nose and eating and serving food

Once I saw that I immediately walked out and notified all the customers inside how unsanitary and disgusting it was

I'm surprised the health department lets them stay in business this is the worst thing I have ever seen and to be in a family owned restaurant it should be a shame

Sorry Lucky's next time I'm craving boogers on my pizza I'll make sure to stop by again other than that you guys are better off going to us Pizza or Ray Pizza down the street"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years(I can remember when it was Roy's).  The pizza and meatball sandwich are fantastic and though I'm not a big wing fan, they've always gone over well with friends and family who are.  Very friendly service and even when I don't order an advertised \"special\" they always apply discounts if they apply.  Very happy to have them as my neighborhood pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza! It's greasy and floppy, the best with only a few toppings or even just cheese."}
{"text":"Best pizza joint in Surprise hands down.  Pizza is a close second to the real deal NYC."}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly atmosphere. Pizza is awesome! Grabbed slices for myself and my girls. Just the right amount of sauce, lots of flavor, not greasy, cooked just right. Will be going back with the entire family!"}
{"text":"Good NYC pizza. Tons of cheese and meat with great flavor. A little pricy, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Their pizza is amazing. Usually I get toppings on my pizza but their cheese pizza taste so good you don't need any toppings. Their wings are so flavorful and crispy, you can't get enough. Their beer they have on tap, they freeze the pitcher and the mugs they give, especially since I love my beer ice cold. The staff is so welcoming and funny. The sitting arrangement is spacey and comfortable. Great place to watch sports. Great place for families. Family owned and they know their food. Once you try their pizza and wings you don't want any other wings or pizza. I have come here with my family on number of events or for date night."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in Surprise. The wings are fried to perfection and their salads are delicious. I have not ordered pizza from anywhere else since I started eating here. I order twice a week.  It is worth the short drive."}
{"text":"Luckys is awesome! Between this place and one other this is all we choose! Forget Pizza Hut etc!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this location. Hands down the best pizza and wings on our side of town. They can be pricey but you get what you pay for. The sauce for the wings is so good we dip our crust in it. The service is great and the delivery times are comparable to the larger pizza chains. I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a great pizza. I recommend trying the white pizza as its phenomenal."}
{"text":"Sometimes you forget to write in support of your favorite places.  I've been to Lucky's probably a dozen times and now it's the only place I'll go for pizza.  Others in Surprise are good but these guys are the best for me. Any Napolitana combo is good and the White pizza and Siciliana special are great."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza joint!! First time trying it since I moved down the street and I will be back! So much better then a bland national chain."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here every couple of weeks. They make a good pizza and we enjoy the lasagna dinner. Nice family run place. A really good value."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great service! We do pick up all the time (I don't think they deliver). It's so worth the few minute drive. They are super fast and fresh and have great daily specials. Lucky' s is our family's favorite go to."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but rave reviews about this place and this was the third time I've been here, third time the sauce tastes like it was scorched and bitter.  Once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, but three times is a standard. There are much better NY/NJ style places in the WV."}
{"text":"Been in Surprise area for 5 years and have just now found the best pizza in the valley. Good prices, good food, nice employees."}
{"text":"We often order from Lucky's and have never had a bad experience. We have lived in this neighborhood for 25+ years and only recently started ordering delivery. It is usually earlier than the estimated 40-45 minutes, and is always still hot, fresh, and delivered my a friendly person. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is great pizza!  I was from the east coast and this is how I remember pizza! The sub sandwiches are fantastic too!  Haven't had a chance to try the lasagna yet, but I bet it's just as good as everything else we've had so far!  Love this place when we visit for the month!"}
{"text":"Love this place! For as many times as we have ordered there they have made one mistake and corrected it pretty quick. I've had their pizza, wings, spaghetti, and calazones. All delicious. The one on Cactus is the better of the two Lucky's."}
{"text":"I just tried Lucky's Pizza for the first time last night and it was awesome!

They serve New York style pizza and it is some of the best I have ever had (granted it's no match for Chicago style), just as good as Ray's Pizza, if not better! The staff working here were very friendly, which made it a pleasant experience all around. I also love that they send out coupons which makes this an affordable place to order from. We even have leftovers and I can tell you after heating them up that their pizza still tastes good the day after.

I think we have found a new favorite pizza place and I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience at Lucky's for the 5 years we have been going there, as a native NY'er we love it there!
But today's pizza was a shocker when I got home and opened the box... Shame on me for not checking it before leaving.  Guess they ran out of medium size pies boxes??

By the time I got home, two kids... Wasn't going to call or go back to get a replacement because simply didn't have the time to drive 25 minutes back and forth!"}
{"text":"Family owned very friendly service, love the fact that you can watch your pizza made right in front of you, ice cold beer with many choices on tap, the wings are awesome!!! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love there pizza and wing deal. The food is really tasty and always quickly delivered. The cannoli's are some of the best I've had. I'll continue to buy food from here. So give it a try and you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Last time I went all the buffalo sauce tasted like franks.  At least add some butter and seasoning. Parmesan sauce tasted like Italian dressing. They do get one star because the crust/bread was good. Crispy on outside soft and spongey inside. Let me know if you want some buffalo/wing sauce recipes."}
{"text":"Today I visited Lucky's Pizza for the first time. Lucky's Pizza is owned by Benny, an old friend of mine. Benny has extensive experience in the pizza business, first having owned a pizza business in New York and then managing Palermo's Pizza in Phoenix, before once again owning his own business now in Glendale. There were no surprises. Lucky's Pizza is a clean, well maintained, family friendly business, serving some of the most authentic New York style Italian cuisine you are likely to experience in Arizona. There are no canned items served here. Benny makes everything on the menu from scratch; from the fresh pizza dough made daily, to the pasta sauce. Benny takes a special pride in the quality of the ingredients he uses. You may have to wait a little longer for your order at Lucky's, because your order is cooked fresh at the time you order it. It doesn't matter if you drop in for a slice of pizza and a cold beer, or you're having a family reunion; the prices are very reasonable and you're always treated like family. Lucky's Pizza is the sort of place that can easily become your favorite eatery."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now with a friend that had insisted we try this place. Haven't been disappointed so far! Pizza here is always delicious and reasonably priced. =D"}
{"text":"We were looking for GOOD NY-style pizza and great wings.  We found both at Lucky's Pizza!  It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.  Their pizza, calzone, and wings are awesome!  We love the delicious and fresh pizza with great quality ingredients.  Service is quick and even \"to go\" orders are just like we like it!  We are \"regulars\" there and are never disappointed!  We are definitely fans and feed our family of 6 (with leftovers)...very filling and tasty.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!    (Delivery would make it PERFECT, but it's WORTH the drive...about 10 minutes each way....we pass by (4) other pizza joints on the way so I hope that's saying ALOT!)"}
{"text":"Paid extra for \"stuffed crust\" pizza which was disgusting, 90% of the pizza was bread/crust with all the toppings in the middle of the pizza. No sauce whatsoever.  If you're a carboholic go for it, if not, stay away from this one."}
{"text":"The best pizza you will ever have. I love the people who work there they are so kind and provide the best customer service. Literally everything on their menu tastes like it was hand crafted from Jesus."}
{"text":"We live in the west valley and there are not many local Mom and pop places for really good pizza around here. We found this place on Yelp and gave it a shot. I love the fact that it is family run and even the children are experiencing the family business. The pizza was very good. Great sauce, cheese and sauce. Some thin crust pizzas are a little too thin for my taste but this one was thick enough to hold all the toppings. My parents are from NY as is the owner and I will be taking them the next time they are in town."}
{"text":"I've had cheese steak, meatball sub, chicken parmesan sub and pizza here so far. All of it has been the best I've had. Eventually ill make my way through the whole menu and i dont doubt ill love it all..ive been coming here for a couple years now and I've never had a bad experience or bad food. All of the staff is super friendly and helpful and it's also very clean. I won't go anywhere else if pizza is what im craving"}
{"text":"Mostly average, but I would give 3.5 stars if I could...

Crust was boring, sauce was bland and minus a point for canned vegetables :(

On the positive side, they are generous with the toppings and the service was pretty good.

Find a new dough recipe, add some spice to your sauce use fresh vegetables for 5 stars."}
{"text":"We've had pizza and wings several times.   Always fantastic!  A few months ago, we ordered pizza, and were given a free calzone because someone had canceled their order last minute. It was good too."}
{"text":"Lucky's Pizza is a really great Pizza and at a reasonable price.  I also really like the fact that they deliver."}
{"text":"Thin crispy pizza I've been looking all over the city!!! Wow it's so good and thin I love it!!!!"}
{"text":"After retiring out here from New Jersey it was a challenge to find pizza that we liked.  We stumbled onto a Lucky's Pizza menu at the post office, went over for a lunch special and fell in love.  The sauce, the cheese, and the crust are all perfect.  The other Italian dishes there are very good also, and the wings are excellent."}
{"text":"We've passed by many times and have wanted to try. Being from the East Coast, I'm really picky with my pizza. 

We ordered a large specialty Sicilian pizza. It was PACKED with a ton of toppings. When I lifted the box off the counter, it felt like it weighed 5 pounds. It was at least 1 1/2\" high... impressive! Taste... the toppings were delicious and so was the crust. The sauce was very good, not perfect, but very good. Overall, the pizza was fantastic."}
{"text":"I used to live right around the corner from Lucky's and it was somewhat of a Friday night tradition to pick up a pizza and some of their amazing wings. The restaurant itself really isn't anything special, they have booths and a tv in there, but it's definitely a take out kind of place. Their food, however, is really good. I am not a huge wing fan, but I absolutely love the wings here. They are almost a bit crunchy and the sauce is unlike any that I have ever had before. The perfect kick, but not too spicy for my sensitive stomach. They have great lunch specials and dinner deals too, so stop in if you are craving some \"real\" pizza and not just the quick production pizza hut stuff."}
{"text":"Blah, blah,blah pizza. Honestly what more can I say. Add some flavor to your sauce, maybe some seasoning. Even my kids didn't like it."}
{"text":"The pizza can use a tune up, however Every other item I have purchased has been Top Notch

Best service in the City of Surprise when it comes to pizza parlors.  Kindest souls around.  I was short a dollar and change a few months ago, and the owner let it slide - 
Customer for Life

By the way, try the Hot Wings \"Crispy\" - You will not regret it"}
{"text":"when i want pizza, this is the one i crave! reminds me of home, new york. yum!!"}
{"text":"A coworker turned me on to this joint, I was missing my east coast (NY) pizza. Damn you got to try it, pretty close to perfect. Had the cheese and it folded just like it should, flavor was there along with the right amount of cheese and sauce!"}
{"text":"Just had the zucchini and chicken bacon ranch pizza and it was DELICIOUS!! The flavor of the pizza and the crispiness is awesome!"}
{"text":"I have loved this place since high school and would go out to lunch with some buddies just about everyday"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Pizza is always super delicious and consistent.  The people are so nice.  It's always clean.  They serve their beer in glass pitchers with frosty mugs.  Pizza crust is perfect and wings are delicious.  Small, family place that everyone should check out."}
{"text":"In town for spring training and found this place. Great service with a friendly smile. Food was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Excellent food! My New Yorker hubby agrees! Love this place! Great pizza, zitti and meatballs! Oh and try the chicken parm calzone! So amazing!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Having moved to Surprise from the NYC area only a year ago, I am a self-proclaimed pizza snob. Having said that, while I have yet to find pizza in the area that comes close to being \"NY Style\", (and we've tried lots of places), Lucky's is our favorite. We order it \"light on the cheese\" and it makes a world of a difference. Compared to Sicilian or Chicago style pizza, yes it's thin, but it's not NY thin."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials especially the sandwiches and subs. I especially love their chicken wings...they do them right every time. I'm not a big fan of thin pizza and the several times I have tired a variety of their pizzas I have been disappointed however one exception is their Lucky's Special Pizza.....this is so mouth watering even though its thin crusted I think I will stick to this from now on LOL. The staff is friendly they have TV's to view and the booths are comfortable."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town and can't go wrong with the $3.95 2-slice + drink lunch special.  Good prices all-around.  Great salads.

Update: Lunch special is now $4.50,but still a great deal.  

This is the place for NY style pizza (Chicago Style pizza lovers need not apply)"}
{"text":"New to the area..Pizza Lovers, had no expectations when ordering because that can be a problem.. Go for the gusto got the besto... to bad I didnt ask for a fridge magnet"}
{"text":"I am sad that Lucky's is so far from where we live.  I worked near Lucky's last year and just happened to walk in for lunch.  My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home, which was so good my husband proposed all over again!

The employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal, but they want to make sure it's right.  I loved everything about my visit there, and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year.  It's about an hour drive from where I live, but the more I think about it, I think we're going to have to go get some more Lucky's pizza.  Great neighborhood pizza place!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we have been here because we got one bad pizza, but I really liked the Lucky special, husband finally gave in and took me there! First off grumpy guy behind the counter was not friendly ! Bad sign! Then the pizza was not what I expected, meat toppings were so thin, you could barely taste them, with an over abundance of onions and green peppers ! Well needless to say we will never be back! So many BETTER places to get pizza!! I really was disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I just tried this place based on the reviews and rating. They were right, this place was delicious had pizza and wings. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Been in surprise for a long time for a reason. Good prices, family owned, and always friendly. Their wings are my favorite but they also have good pizza and steak sandwiches. I love supporting a family owned business that actually cares about their customers."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Top two fav for pizza and best place for a hot sandwich. I enjoy the steak and cheese special. Also props for NO Onions when requested as I have an allergy. We order from here almost weekly. So good.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for pizza in Surprise! I also love that I can order a slice or two as opposed to a whole pie! Wings great ask for them crispy!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this one by saying I only went here because a friend of mine chose it for her celebration.  There are just way too many fantastic pizza places around the valley and nearby to sort of waste your tastebuds on Lucky's.  

The pizza was extremely bland and lackluster.  My friend and I shared a jalapeno and meatball pizza.  Thankfully, the jalapenos and nice seasoning to the meatballs saved it.  But the sauce was seriously lacking.  

You may be wondering why I gave it 3 stars?  Well...that's because their hot wings were delicious!  Their sauce was so tasty that several of us dipped our pizza crust in it.  Boy what a difference it made!  If you're in the area, you may want to just grab up some of these wings of theirs and take them home.  Lucky's is just too plain and boring to order much else there."}
{"text":"We've gotten take out a couple of times and while the wings are very good, my primary complaint is that the pizza crust is soggy. There is nothing worse than soggy crust on a pizza. It doesn't matter what we've gotten for toppings...the crust isn't crisp or even remotely having that bite to it that makes pizza crust so yum. It's not like the pizza is sitting around long. It takes us less than 7 minutes to get home and we eat it immediately.

One day soon I'll come and dine in to really see if it's the crust or if its just the fact that I've gotten it as take-out. 

But all in all, a decent enough place to try out on a Friday night if you are looking for something beyond the typical chains."}
{"text":"This is an authentic local pizza place and it is awesome. People were great and the price was good too.  Most importantly, is the pizza... and it was great. The ingredients were clearly fresh. We had both a Sicilian and a thin crust - both were cooked perfectly. Probably a contender for best pizza I've ever had. Go here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food. The pizza was soggy.wings had no flavor..the ranch was like watwr and the chees sticks were cold. Dud not mean to give 2 stars"}
{"text":"The first time we tried Lucky's was maybe six years ago. I didn't like it then. Hard to remember what we ordered, perhaps a Sicilian style, but either the crust or sauce or something else turned us off and we decided not to go back. Until a couple of weeks ago, when, having exhausted just about every other food place in Surprise two dozens times over, I came up with the jolly idea of getting us some Lucky's again based on all the good reviews. And I hated it just as much this time around as the first. UGH.

The only positive thing I can say about this place is that they give you a ~monstrous~ amount of pizza. Imagine a large pizza box precisely filled with a giant square BRICK of a pizza, easily an inch and a half tall and cut into square slices. That's what we got. I'd say it was over 3 pounds of pizza; flavorless and gross. I found it breathtaking that it had that little taste. This was a supreme pizza that tasted through and through like I was eating play-doh. Olives, sauce, cheese, crust, the works. To top it off, the mushrooms were slimy, canned champignons and not fresh at all, and tasted as though they'd just been pulled out of someone's nose. I've had some pretty bad pizza in my time, most of them I'd liken to eating chewy, dry cardboard. This was the first one that was this big and relatively succulent and STILL tasted gross.

I stomached maybe six slices over two sorry-ass sittings before throwing about 2/3 of the pizza away. Two pounds' worth of \"food\", down the sh1tter. I don't know where the mass delusion about this place comes from, but I'll never return. If I want a gutbuster special, especially now that Bronco Billy's is gone, I'll head to Rays just down the road instead. Plus, Lucky's is overpriced. A large and a smaller pizza cost us $30. Most of the smaller pizza was thrown away too - I didn't try any of that one so I'm not reviewing it, but the wife said she was incredibly unimpressed with it, and it was just a plain cheese. If it all tasted good it would have been worth it - I'd have paid that and more for a Chuck Wagon Special from Billy's - but the lack of flavour and value drops my rating of this joint to a bottom-of-the-barrel single star. And just for proverbials and giggles: http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=inspectionResultsDrillDownAA&permit=FD-05766&business=Lucky's%20Pizza&address=15508%20W%20Bell%20Rd%20Suite%20207&insp_id=3182324"}
{"text":"Pizza is good - meatball sub was great - steak sub very good - roast beef not so much -"}
{"text":"Service was great! Had a calzone, it was good. Not the style of dough I'm used to, meats were good."}
{"text":"The pizza was great! 
In AZ it's either Lucky's or Joe's when it comes to pizza.  (Lucky's on 67th Ave and cactus)"}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 times and each time it has been just great.  Great pizza - I've had the same pizza each time; the Lucky Special, and I tell, it just can't get much better.  Great sauce, great crust and the toppings are thick and tasty.  

I have recommended this place to all my friends and to a lot of people that I meet from out of town.  (I am in the travel business so I see a lot of out of town visitors)."}
{"text":"Back for more... again, this is the real deal! Got a meatball parm sub today. It's not only the best I have had out here in AZ but also all but one place in NY! This was the best meatball parm  sub I have ever had. Sub roll is fresh and delicious, meatballs homemade and outrageously delicious! Great quality cheese and an unbelievable excellent sauce.

This was my second visit and it will not be my last.. this is my new favorite!! I wish I lived next door to this place!!!

Again, I did not take any photos because they look identical to the ones already posted. They are consistent and they take a lot of care with their food!!"}
{"text":"Family owned, been going here for the last 10 plus years. Great staff and food! My wife hates onions so we don't get that! This is great pizza! I love to go up there because they have the coldest beer in Surprise. It turns into an ice beer slushy as you drink it!"}
{"text":"Crust was amazing! Love love their sausage  and mushroom pizza ! Thumbs up! 


Also great cheese only NY style pizza
Great for a pick up"}
{"text":"So like any mom I didn't want to cook Thursday night. We recently moved into the area and thanks to my fellow yelpers, I found this gem.

Ordered directly off the Yelp site to the restaurant. 

1 large cheese pizza 
20 mild wings
6 mozzarella sticks
1 meatball sub 
1 steak, mushroom and peppers
1 large anti pasta salad
Chicken Parmesan dinner plate (which came with a small side salad and a large breadstick) 

This all came to only $67.07. Only deal we used was the 1 large pizza and 20 wings, I believe for $23.00. 

I picked up our order and met the awesome family running the place. The daughter (owner?) gave me the run down on her father owning 4 and now they have 2 and that they fry the wings. She even told me another great place to try if I love wings so much. What business does that?! A non greedy one, that's who! 

We get home and are amazed by all the food. Everything and I mean everything was beyond delicious. It was so much damn food and we filled up quickly. Happy to say we were able to stretch it for dinner that night, lunch the next day and dinner for 2 of us the next night. Score!!!! 

Now my local spot, thank you Lucky's!"}
{"text":"My wife and I first tried Lucky's at the Surprise, AZ location about 13 years ago and then when we moved back to this side of town we been enjoying the Cactus location.

The wings are so delicious, crispy and have just the right amount of sauce on them. The pizza is really good too I love the cheese.

You can score a large cheese pizza and 20 wings I believe for $21.99 or $23.99 something like that but it's a great deal nonetheless."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pepperoni Pizza Roll and was 100% satisfied. I will crave it in the future! It is a cheese lovers delight. The salad was terrific with multiple cheeses, olives. The cheese sticks were run of the mill but good nonetheless. This is a restaurant I would frequent!"}
{"text":"Coldest beer in Surprise! Wings are the bomb!"}
{"text":"I have to say that after rave reviews from my 19yr old Daughter I tried Lucky's pizza tonight. Stated out by long delivery time. I was told 40 minutes not bad. Well 40 minutes became 1hr 10 minutes.. Driver was nice I was really excited about trying this as my daughter said there pizza is so  good. Well the pizza arrived  lukewarm, alright I'll deal with it.  Well I took that first bite and awww....... DISSAPOINTMENT it was okay nothing special. Should make my Daughter pay me back for false reporting of good pizza to her dad. Lol I have say I will not be back.. it not bad but it's not good just okay. Maybe tonight was a bad night idk but the long delay on delivery it not being hot  and it only being okay strikes out for me.. 
Think the biggest disappointment was the report from my daughter lol"}
{"text":"Ordering online for delivery was very easy!  My wife was craving pizza, looking through Yelp, I found this place and decided to order because of the other reviews.  The food was delivered before the time in which it said it would and it was great.  Wouldn't order the bread sticks again because they were a little burnt, but my wife enjoyed the pizza and I the salad.  Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, friendly staff, fair pricing.  I'll be back soon.  I like my pizza a little extra crispy and they are one of the few places that seemed to get it.  A little more cooked without being burned.  You all are great.  Also the sauce and toppings were flavorful!"}
{"text":"I'm from NYC so I know good pizza and I know NYC pizza and Lucky's hits a bullseye! Everything you imagine about NYC pizza Lucky's delivers down to slices available all day! Now let's talk about their dinner plates absolutely delicious I recommend eggplant parmesan and chicken parmesan great too! Bread always extremely fresh on meatball sandwich I'm addicted to lol. Just check this place out, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been getting my pizza fix here for years and just live the place. The oie is great on a super thin crust that cant be beat. The toppings are always first rate and the service is too.

Whether you are stopping in for a lunch special or taking home to the family you will love it too!"}
{"text":"When you walk in it is a little dark, a little beat up, but DO NOT let that turn you away. The service is AMAZING, staff is super friendly and accommodating, prices are right on point, the wings are crispy but still juicy, and the pizza...THE PIZZA...man lite but filling and doesn't leave you feeling bogged down. Seriously have not had a single issue at this spot. Every time I go there...which is often...and this place is a bit of a drive sadly...the experience and food just keep me coming back. I would say this is the number 1 pizza spot in AZ and I have been to A LOT of pizza spots out here..."}
{"text":"I usually love this place but have become very grossed out, with the guy working there has blue medical gloves on never changes them, uses them for everything. even went in to the bathroom and came out using the same gloves, I can no longer go there after that"}
{"text":"just happen to drive by and noticed this pizza joint hidden on Reems! So since i have been trying to try out every pizza joint out in the west valley! I stopped by and had a slice. i usually have my pizza well done, since I like the crust and doe to be crunch! But since I was in a rush and didn't ask for it. Pizza was still great, sauce, cheese, and peperoni had a lot of flavors! Everyone was very friendly, seemed like all the customers were having a good time. I will diffidently come back with the wife and try it again!!"}
{"text":"Moving to surprise and a bit of a pizza snob I found this delightful place. The food is excellent and offers a large selection of New York Italian dishes and great pizza. After coming here a few times they treat you like family and are great folks. Family run and everyone is friendly and eager to assist and chat with customers. Highly recommend the baked ziti and the calzones."}
{"text":"After our first visit this week, I think we've found our newest favorite pizza place! We've lived in our house for about 15 years and eat pizza 2-4 times a month. We had never heard of this place. We were in the mood for some 'za and decided to look online for something different from our usual haunts. A Yahoo search turned up this place just to the edge of the map. The attached Yahoo reviews looked promising and a quick look at Yelp sealed the deal. We decided to give it a shot. 

I'm ecstatic! As long as they're consistent (except for below), this is our new place! Keep up the good work Lucky's. We're lucky to have found you! 

-1 star = Our wings were overcooked (making them tough) but the sauce made them very tolerable! Definitely not a deal breaker!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Not a fan. First time was good. Had the 2 slice pizza and drink combo for $4.00

Tonight we had pizza and wings. Wings are super hot, for medium. Not too happy about that. Although they did offer after awhile of seein my daughters mouth on fire to tame them down. But then they came back cold. $45 plus for so so food. No thanks. 

Good for lunch combos - that's about it. Sucks because I'm all about supporting independent business owners."}
{"text":"OK been ordering here the last 3 mos now and will prob continue. The first time was before moving and they offered to help us move if we needed the muscle. That goes way above normal customer service if you ask me. Last month we ordered for the fights it was a bit late and their driver already went home for the night so dude makes his gf deliver to us. We had been driving around Jerome all day and barely made it back in time for UFC. Anyways they saved the night. They were out of fresh basil so he did tomato and fresh garlic. I dont really like strong garlic tastes or smells but this pizza was awesome!!! They will pretty much make you anything you want too.

The other night we ordered but we had run out of beer  so guess what. They charged us for a six pack and picked one up on the way!! This place rawks harder than any chigiddy chain chain!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Lucky's Pizza for over a decade and the reason is consistency. The have great service, authentic taste and, most importantly a clean environment.  The staff is friendly and always greet you with a smile."}
{"text":"My friend and I go here at least once a week. I was skeptical when he drug me there for the first time (this book doesn't have the prettiest cover). Now I'm hooked. At this point I've had just about everything and it's all five stars. My only tip is if you order the wings, ask them to fry them a little less than usual."}
{"text":"Lucky's is great if you're looking for this style of pizza. Authentic, great toppings (broccoli my favorite!) and the atmosphere is awesome. The family here is so warm, all of them really funny, always making me laugh when I go in there! Thank you for being the first great food experience I had upon moving to Surprise!"}
{"text":"These guys are some real down to earth east coast italian pizza men.

They don't mess around.  They make some of the best pies in town.

Remember now, this is Phoenix, so this is a 5 star Phoenix pizza rating.

Good hand-tossed crust.  Decent pies.  You won't hate on them for sure.

It's no delivery, but then you're not eating trash from Pizza Hut either.  It is worth the trip."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The pizza crust is perfect and the wings are to die for. Oh, and they serve Coke! HaHa!"}
{"text":"So delish! I stumbled on this place and my little man is so happy we did. The flavors in the sauce alone, are out of this world. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, I can appreciate decent NY style pizza. This is close enough though I think the cheese is a little skimpy and the pepperoni is sliced razor thin. The hot dishes are also very good. The meatball parm is my favorite. The folks who own, run, work here are very nice too. A reviewer below this prefers Tailgators pizza. I always enjoy a good laugh. I  play trivia there on Tuesdays and have had the pizza special. No comparison. Lucky's is light years better. With the impending opening of the awful Oreganos, I hope people remember to keep patronizing this place. I'd hate to lose it."}
{"text":"This is our go-to local pizza place. We have been coming here for years and will continue to for the foreseeable future. It seems like the owners may have changed recently but the food is good and service is quick. 

This New York restaurant is decent size inside complete with three tvs and they even have a few old school arcade games. They have beer, bottles and draft, and a really big menu of pizza, pasta, salads, and wings. We looooove their pizza- tasty sauce and crispy crust! Also, we order their spaghetti with meatballs which comes with a small salad (the house dressing is really zingy) and garlic bread. Free refills on sodas and they always have good lunch specials. 

Oh, and did I mention they deliver? Yeah that's an extra bonus for those times when I'm too lazy to drive or too tired after work. 

Stop on by. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance are dull, but who cares.  The pizza is fantastic and not to mention the staff and service were excellent. The best pizza in Surprise."}
{"text":"We like Lucky's. We like Lucky's because the family that owns it is great. They are friendly, customer service oriented and work at producing great food for a good price. We have used Lucky's as our go to pizza shop for the past year. We have tried a lot of different pizzas on the menu, and have had the Chicken Parmi sandwiches. Excellent. Having had pizza all over the U.S., I can say that I am content with having used Lucky's as our only pizza shop for the past year. 

Large pie, large wings, usually about $25 and we're set for the night. 2 pies, one with everything on it, an additional 1 topping pie, and 25 wings will usually run us about $38. We get smoking hot pie that tastes great, and leaves us with a smile on our faces. What more could you want?

When I mentioned customer service, we had an experience that allowed us to drive BACK to Lucky's from Wittmann. We ordered 2 pies. Upon arrival back at the house, SOMMMMMMEONE \"forgot\" there was a pie on the back seat. Upon opening the car door, Someone watched a large pizza tumble from the back seat, out of the box, sliding down and along the back seat, down the door frame, and onto the ground. Dirt pizza anyone? Nope. A quick call had a new pie ready to go in 20 minutes, faster than it took Someone to drive down to atone for their sins. 

Why the review now? Because I've read about Ray's and we've decided to try it tonight. A review WILL be written."}
{"text":"Lucky's is your typical New York style pizza.. thin, chewy crisp crust.. ample toppings, great calzones and prices! They also make this lasagna pizza, ground pork, mozzarella, red sauce and ricotta.. oh yeah!"}
{"text":"We love Luckys pizza!  They have a huge delivery area and the food always comes fresh.  Great specials every day of the week!"}
{"text":"So glad I decided to randomly grab a pizza from Lucky's Pizza for dinner one day. I knew exactly what time I would need to pick up the pizza so I opted to order online for pickup rather than going in and grabbing it myself or having it delivered. 

In terms of food, we got the white pizza (and added mushrooms for an additional $1.75) and some fried mushrooms on the side. As you can tell, we're a fan of mushrooms. I dropped by Lucky's at the pick up time and the pizza was ready to go which was great! Service was super friendly and left a great impression even with my minimal interactions with the staff. 

The pizza itself was deeelicious. Super flavorful and filling without being too greasy or overwhelming. The fried mushrooms were made with some great quality mushrooms and I would definitely get them again. All in all this place has great pizza, welcoming service, and convenient takeout/delivery options that make it amazing!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Luckys for years and I have to say they have the BEST pizza around!!!! Growing up we always are at Rays pizza and once I tried Luckys we immediately found our new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Lucky's last night and I am definitely a fan!  Their prices are great and they have specials too.  We ordered a large pepperoni and a large sausage and olive pizza.  The ingredients are noticeably higher quality than that of the regular chain pizza restaurant.  The sausage was what really made me love it though.  Shaved pieces of Italian sausage blanketed the pizza.  Seriously, you have to try it!  My parents are now fans too."}
{"text":"My wife and I found Lucky's through Eat24 and are so happy we did. 

Normally, we order their medium cheese and 10 wings special delivered. We get medium wings and they are always fresh, crispy with just enough sauce. 

The pizza is a New York style thin crust with a delightfully doughy crust. The dough itself has a lot of good flavor and they never over do it with the cheese or sauce. Perfect proportions. I also really like the tang of the tomato sauce. 

My wife has also ordered their stuffed shells and was pleasantly surprised at the great flavor and portion size. 

When we do eat in, they are always super friendly and attentive. Love it here. 

A+ my friends, A+."}
{"text":"I've lived most of my life on the East coast, and I know what New York style pizza is all about.  THIS is New York style pizza....and it is excellent.  I've had many of the items on their menu, from cheese steak sandwiches to the eggplant parmesean dinner.  It is all great.  Their salad is terrific too.  Eat here.  You won't be sorry.  Oh...and the family that runs this restaurant are nice people too."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials and their menu has so many options. Could definitely spend several days trying a little bit of everything. Had two slices of pepperoni pizza that was very good and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Had chicken parmigiana with spaghetti was very disappointed it's taste was like if it was frozen. The only good thing was the bread and salad. I didn't taste their pizza so I Can't comment on that but don't recommend the pasta"}
{"text":"I may have to try this again - haven't tried them since we moved here about 4 years ago.  HATED it.  Bread was chewey and the cheese tasted like rubber.  Just not good for me.  But then we are both pizza snobs.  My husband thinks it's passable - but if I'm going to eat the calories I want awesome pie.  Since so many seem to love it I may give another chance, but based on several inital tries they are \"Lucky\" to even get 2 stars from me unti proven otherwise...stay tuned."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good! It was thin and the cheese along with the other ingredients were delicious. The slices are quite large and you will definitely have left overs. It was very satisfying"}
{"text":"Lucky's Pizza is great. This is what Independence is all about. The ability to have an idea and to go out and make it happen. The family of Lucky's pizza is great and there are several locations in the west valley and each one is owned and operated by a family member. Cousin, uncle, brother, Etc. :) It's a great thing. 

There pizza has a great thin crust with fresh toppings. They get there sausage locally and cook it up fresh in store and then slice it thin on the slicer. no precooked or packaged crap. Real fresh Italian Sausage. It rocks. I highly recommend trying it. 

The wings have a great sauce and they come out crispy and juicy. They don't disappoint. 

I am a fan of Lucky's pizza and several other independent pizza joints around town. Arizona is Lucky, to have them. :)"}
{"text":"You know when you pick up a slice pf pizza and the dough is breadlike and it  holds all the topping on the pizza slice? Sadly this pizza was not that. 
Picked up a slice, out of a large pizza with three toppings, and all the toppings and cheese slipped off because the \"bread\" was more like play-dough or a wet noodle and was as limp as a noodle. It was impossible to eat this pizza with our hands, except for the very outer edge of the crust which was well cooked and not limp. It had lots of cheese and ample toppings, but no pizza dough to hold it all together.
We had wings too, they were OK, nothing special but were at least edible."}
{"text":"Greasy tasty new York style pizza. Pretty good, will be back for more. The pizza was a little Greasy though so if you don't like Greasy pizza this might not be for you."}
{"text":"I walked into lucky's tonight to find it busier than I've ever seen it. Despite that they were still making sure everyone got acknowledged and got the correct order. The food was awesome as usual, my sister-in-law seemed to especially enjoy the fried zuchinni being that there was none left.  I'm glad to see a local business like this thriving despite an economy where so many family owned establishments are closing their doors."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area for a tourney and decided to try it due to the high reviews. Boy are we glad we did!! For starters the woman who took our order was very friendly and helpful in deciding what to order. We ordered a special with pepperoni pizza and wings. So delicious!! We scarfed it down and finished everything between the 3 of us. If we are in the area, we will definitely make our way out here again. It's just that good."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! I have had their fried mushrooms, mozzarella sticks, subs and pizza. My waistline hates me, but totally worth it! Fast, friendly delivery...arrives hot! Totally recommend."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, we decided to give it a try for dinner.  Pizza was very good.  The staff was extremely friendly.  Not a fancy place, just a great food and cold beer."}
{"text":"If you want NY style pizza save your money and head to NYPD! Quality and cleanliness of NYPD is worth the extra $! 
The smell of the place smelled like a kids play place. Right away I was questioning the cleanliness of this place but ignored my thoughts as we continued on to order and give it a shot anyway.  As we waited for the pizza at a table I continued to question our decision to eat there. The floor looked like it wasn't very clean, the table was sticky and it smelled. Having a kid with a heart condition and needing to make sure things are extra clean I was screaming inside but we had already placed our order and our money had been spent. The tray that the pizza came on smelled like it wasn't clean. Like a dish that sat in milky water and sort of got washed but no special close attention paid to really cleaning it. As a result the pizza also had that taste to it. We managed to eat it anyway, wanting to not feel it was a total loss. Telling my daughter to finish up so we could go for ice cream, SHE FINDS A HAIR IN HER PIZZA SLICE! We all immediately drop our slices cleaned up our table and left. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"The pizza has good flavor, but it was a little undercooked making the center part soggy."}
{"text":"I'll be back to try the pizza. This place looks like it could be a great neighborhood pizza joint. I stopped in Saturday night for some late food on my drive home from the Coyotes game. Sure, I was the only customer there at 9pm, (the place is open till 11, a plus in my book) but I was greeted promptly with a smiling young guy with an east coast accent (another plus for a pizza place. I was alone so ordered a sandwich instead of a pie, to go. I asked for a steak and cheese, and he reminded me it's much better with mushrooms and peppers..good call, suggesting the works. The sandwich, phenomenal, the service, great!"}
{"text":"We had a youth baseball tournament this weekend in Peoria.  We made reservations last minute for the whole team/parents and they accommodated us.  Food came out fairly quick and we received great service."}
{"text":"Place is okay. The only reason for 3 star is the price and the grease on their pizzas is a lil norm but the flavor is awesome....  We havent found breadsticks we like there so we normally get wings, pizza and salad. They r a little higher priced than say peter piper, but they deliver! The wing sauce will eat thru the foil tray they deliver in within a couple days so dont leave it sit in your fridge too long! Delivery guys r always nice and pleasant. Some come prepared with parmesean and napkins.  Just depends who ya get."}
{"text":"Great pizza, wings, and sandwiches! I've been eating here since grade school and the quality has always been consistent."}
{"text":"Solid pizza here. Being from back east I am very particular and pretty critical of the Pizza out here. The place has an old neighborhood feel, they serve on paper plates which is how its done, the pizza looks like NY pizza, it has a nice crisp crust and the cheese and sauce compliment it well. The only think I frown upon is the price, they charge pretty high but its the 2nd best pizza i have found out here. The best is Taste Of Italy in Goodyear."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA AROUND! Its very close to where I live which I love, but they are seriously the best pizza ive found here! I am very picky about pizza so for me to like theirs its a surprie. They always greet me like they know me and I love that they are a family owned business. They also deliver which is GREAT for when I dont want to leave the house! I have gone here MANY times and plan to continue going for a long time!"}
{"text":"Called in a large Lucky's Meat Lover's Pizza and 25 medium wings for pick-up on a Friday night at 6:30pm.  Was ready in 20 minutes, hot and fresh.   Generous amounts of toppings on the pizza as described on the menu and the wings were served with a twangy buffalo sauce and tasty ranch dressing.   Everything was delicious at a very reasonable price.   Lucky's is our new to-go pizza place from now on!"}
{"text":"I heard about Lucky's Pizza through one of my Facebook groups.  It came highly recommended, so I decided to try it.  I ordered two large pizzas (one cheese, one pepperoni) and a large dinner salad with the house Italian dressing.  I was told the dressing was homemade.  The people behind the counter were very nice.  The pizza was very good.  The crust was thin and crispy and the cheese and pepperoni were fresh.  No complaints.  The salad was okay, nothing special, but the dressing was delicious.  I would have given five stars, but the restaurant was a little too dirty for my liking.  The vents and light fixtures over the counters and oven were very dirty.  If they take care of the cleanliness, I will definitely give five stars!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, great wings. A little lacking in the variety of wing flavors (hot, medium, mild, and barbecue). Wish they offered a suicide and another sweet flavor. Cant say I have had an issue with the service here either, been here quite a few times and they are always polite and efficient.

Overall a good place to grab a slice and some wings."}
{"text":"Great New York style pizza and great wings. Good deal and great people with a great sense of humor. You can tell they actually enjoy what they are doing. This has become a quick favoite of ours for takeout and even eat in."}
{"text":"We had takeout from this place last night. It was good, but not amazing.  Less than $20 for a two topping large pizza. The service was VERY friendly and quick. I would order from this place again."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! As my friends and I sit here and eat this delectable pizza a few things come to mind, cheesesteak and ricotta. Believe it or not I called in and asked for a large pizza and a cheesesteak, hold the bun and toss it on the pizza. We are now feasting on a little slice of heaven, a pizza covered in onions, green peppers, mushrooms and cheesesteak. All this sitting on top of cheese under a layer of ricotta cheese sauce......stop drooling, you wish you had smell a vision right now...even better call the and order this you will be hooked for life!!"}
{"text":"Terrific Sicilian pie. Perfect, crispy crust. My wife said the regular pizza was excellent too. We're both from NYC.   We'll return to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Tried this pizza for the 1st time. I'm a NYC pizza snob. The plain cheese pizza was close but not that close. Ordered extra crispy wings over the phone and got wings that were not crispy at all. They didn't have blue cheese dressing,.but that's an AZ thing. Don't know if I'll try this place again. They don't deliver."}
{"text":"The best pizza and wings i love their staff they have the best customer service plus they deliver !!!!"}
{"text":"Lucky's Pizza, Reems & Bell rd., Surprise AZ
I've passed this restaurant many times and wanted to give it a try. I finally decided to try it since the reviews sounded good. I went in and placed a carry out order for a med pizza, large Italian salad, and an order of wings.
The staff, two gentle men who were working there were kind and helpful in answering my questions and placing my order. I don't think I was there more than 20 mins for my order to be ready.
Everything was nicely packaged and delicious. Being of Italian decent from Chicago, I was surprised to find the pizza crust to be thin typical of pizza in the Chicago land area. The sauce and topping was great as well as the crust. The salad was plenty and fed three adults. It was made with fresh crispy lettuce, olives, and plenty of fresh tomatoes and peppers. 
The wings were delicious and complimented the meal nicely.
I have no complaints and list it as a good experience. I would easily recommend it to anyone and will be returning."}
{"text":"This was our first time enjoying Lucky's and it was well worth the price....fast and friendly delivery and great wings and pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered over the phone at nine, the guy said the food would be here in 50 minutes. After an hour it still wasn't here so we called again and they said they were on their way. The food didn't come until 11 and when it did the pizza and the pasta was cold. The calamari was just plain bad and the \"garlic bread\" was three garlic knots as big as my thumb. When the delivery guy came his excuse was that they were busy. We definitely would not be ordering from here again. The ravioli was good. Part of it was our fault for ordering calamari from a pizzeria but the calamari was cold and not fresh at all."}
{"text":"Craving Sicilian and this place hit the spot. 22 years in business and they know what they're doing"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to place as well as their location in Glendale. They have always been friendly and pretty quick, but as of lately it's so greasy and soggy it's not very good to me. I will say however they do have some of the best wings around. They do end up over sauced at times but still good."}
{"text":"These guys never disappoint. I've dined in a few times, and had delivery even more. The food is always fresh and the service is always great."}
{"text":"We're in town for our annual
Spring Training trip & the kids wanted pizza. Reviews for Lucky's looked decent so we headed over. Honestly, we weren't expecting much but wow, were we wrong! Very good pizza & wings, excellent eggplant parm & homemade cannoli. Everything was fresh & delicious. The service was very friendly & the food arrived quickly. We're leaving stuffed & happy that we have a new favorite place to hit next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"My family and I go to Lucky's every week. We love love love their pizza! If you haven't tried it, you must. It's truly the best in Az!!!"}
{"text":"For a east coast transplant. I really enjoyed Lucky's pizza. Finally a good place to go for real pizza that reminds me of my hometown. Loved it and so did the hubby, which is a bug compliment from a pizza buff. Great taste and price! Go here!"}
{"text":"We have tried several pizza places in the 6 + months we have been in the valley. So in our progression we came across Lucky's. Man what a great place, ordered 2 large NYS pizzas and 10 wings, wanted to get a feel for their wares.

WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!! I have 5 people in my family and we had almost a whole pizza left for the upcoming week. There is nothing much better that really good pizza that you can eat on all week.

Give these guys a try, you can feed the whole family and not break the bank!"}
{"text":"Still the best! Always on point. Since my last post I must have enjoyed this amazingly delicious pizza and wings tens of times... no joke. Always good. Always just the way you want it."}
{"text":"We just love to come to Lucky's,  we love the Lucky's Special.  We have been coming to Lucky's since arriving here 7 years ago from Wisconsin.
The Special has oodles of fresh cut veggies, pepperoni, etc.  We are seniors and get the medium, enough for us to have for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Decided to come here since Pullanos was packed on football Sunday. This was my first visit and it was no disappointment. I think they had about 3 or 4 tvs showing the football games. The cashier and cook was polite. The food came out quick and boy was it delicious. Very affordable and clean. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I liked Lucky's. We got delivery. Pizza, wings, and a sandwich. We will order again"}
{"text":"I was starving after a crazy drive to Arizona and waiting another two hours for my friend's aunt, but the pizza was fast, cheesy and delicious, but INCREDIBLE crispy texture, but the sauce was thumbs down not good but I was completely filled and happy."}
{"text":"Love their pizza, NY style.  Good place to stop for a quick slice or bring a whole pie home. Also, the hero's surely looked good, but I haven't tried one yet. Only been there 4-5 times. Yummy."}
{"text":"Ordered the meat pizza and told them we did not want the extra cheese- it came with extra cheese anyway. Too much meat, it just made the crust too soggy. I think it was the ham that tasted spoiled so we pulled it off and didn't eat it. We are hoping we don't get sick. The garlic bread was a small loaf of Italian bread with a bit of butter and garlic brushed across the top of the loaf - almost tasteless as no garlic or butter made it inside the loaf. My son liked his slice of cheese. They had Coke products which was a plus. Everyone was polite but I don't know how this place gets 4 stars.  Maybe it was an off night. It was really warm inside as well.  Sadly we won't be back."}
{"text":"Super nice people - good prices. I wish the pizza had more red sauce. Generous toppings. Good crust! Don't pass on the yummy cannoli."}
{"text":"Not terrible but it didnt meet up with the expectations I have read from some reviews online. Pizza was ok, wings were small. I still prefer Barros but really hoping to find an authentic NY style pizza joint here in town."}
{"text":"Okay back at it tonight.  
And I love this place.  
They have great wings and pizza.  
It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Was recommended to Lucky's. We were anxious to find good pizza since we are from the Northeast.  The pizza was a nice size and plenty of pepperoni but very soggy. I might try to order it again and ask them to cook it well-done. Maybe it won't be soggy. The staff were very nice too."}
{"text":"I had pizza at the Glendale location and absolutely loved it!! I was excited to find out that they had one right around the corner from my house. I ordered for delivery. One pizza costed me 28.00+ which is acceptable for the quality of the food. Well when I received my pizza it def wasn't what I ordered. No problem shit happens right?, well I called over there to let them know I was planning on coming by to get what I had paid for. The man on the phone who said he was the \"owner\" knowing that if he was he would have handled the situation differently decided to tell me I was wrong and called me little girl and just continued to insult me. So of course I was mad, I went down there requested a refund and told him I wanted to speak to a manager. He refused, told me to leave, chased me outside getting in my face and threatening to call the cops and telling me not to come back!first off I'm a woman, and second you just don't do that! Lol all over adding some more toppings to my pizza that he had screwed up in the first place.
I will give them 1 star for my delivery driver Alex being very polite and and helpful letting me know that guy was in fact not the owner or manager. I haven't bothered to go back although id love to, I'm just afraid I will get chased down ha ha"}
{"text":"Tonight I had the stuffed shells. I also ordered a pizza for home. Pizza is NY style and is always great. I've been eating here for over 10 years and this place remains consistently good. Four shells come with the dish. Stuffed full of flavored cheese, super silky. It was covered with mozzarella, melted and bubbling. The sauce is just slightly on the sweet side but you can still taste tomatoes all the way through. The dinner plates come with a loaf of bread and a big side salad. The dressing seems to be a creamy Italian which I really like. I drizzle the garlic bread with the dressing, rip a piece off and get to dunking in the tomato sauce surrounding the shells. Yummy. Staff are beyond helpful and very friendly. The place is very busy this Friday night which I love to see. I support local businesses."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Huge delicious pizza slices. The sausage and cheese sandwich was a monster, and he added peppers for me. The wings were nice and crispy. I wish this was in my back yard I'd eat here everyday. The customer service is great as well."}
{"text":"Place isn't and won't ever have the same taste since they switched owners."}
{"text":"You feelin' lucky, punk?

I have to agree with Ian S. when he says that Lucky's knows their pizza.  But wow is he a Phoenix basher.  Anyone read his list about AZ?  He sure does hate our state.  

But that doesn't change the fact that Sunny's is pretty good pizza for down and dirty cheap.  If you live nearby, you'll also get some great coupons in the mail. I haven't been to the East coast, so I can't say whether or not their pizza tastes like it's from NY, but it's a nice change from the chains out there (I'm talkin' to you Papa).  Give it a whirl next time you're too lazy to cook!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza!!!!! It is delicious!!! And its inexpensive! It's kind of a hole in the wall place.. family owned and operated. Great family. Very friendly, nice people. Again the pizza is just fantastic and it's large portions!!! YUM"}
{"text":"Gave Lucky's a try ... Very skeptical , but had decent reviews ... And to my surprise ... Good Pizza and Wings ... Paid a little more than the chain joints ... But enjoyed the food !!! I recommend Lucky s"}
{"text":"we have been going to lucky pizza for over ten years.   best kept secret in surprise. meals are reasonable priced.  check out the chicken parmesan excellent."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Surprise, so yes that's as good as it it gets!  Great pepperoni pizza, nice crust, great flavors, and they give you a large amount of pizza.  A large is actually a large here.  I mistakenly bought 2 large pizzas and have enough for 2 days.  
I love the pizza here and great specials on wings and pizza if you need to feed a small army.

I only have one wish, offer delivery???  I would get pizza form here more often, but it is a drive for me.  I am accustomed to pizza being brought to me, just seems like a normal business practice for pizza now.  

So if that did not make any sense they do not deliver.  You will have to go get it or sit and eat."}
{"text":"Friendly service and nice environment. Pizza is tasty and not too expensive! You cant purchase by the slice which is convenient."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and it was below average only because the pizza I ordered (by the slice) was definitely sitting for hours. I ordered the 2 slices of the their special edition which contains pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, onions and mushrooms. They added those toppings and fresh cheese to old slices. The pizza was exxxxtttrrraaa crispy when I got it because they reheated an old pizza. It tasted better than I thought so I'm going back and will order a whole pie just to taste a fresh pizza. Store is clean and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Simply put this place is outstanding.  Great food, great guys that run it, decent atmosphere if you eat in and always fast if you're getting take out.  Love it."}
{"text":"When I used to live in Surprise this was my favorite pizza place.  Not too greasy, always cooked perfectly (I like my pizza well done), yummy cheese, crispy crust, and tasty sauce.  The guys who work there are always very friendly.  They don't have wait service, you just order to go or sit in the booths, it's totally casual.  A good family place.  They also have cheap beer if I remember correctly.  I've never tried anything besides the pizza because I enjoyed it so much!  They don't deliver, I wish they did!"}
{"text":"The name should by Lucky's. Leave out the pizza part. Using imitation cheese and canned tomato sauce doesn't qualify it as pizza. The bread, no not dough, sucks out any remaining flavor out of the dish. It's soggy and miserable. The place is sketch and the only reason to visit the place is to have a terrible pizza to compare it by. Bleh."}
{"text":"Tried an X-Large pepperoni last night. The pizza was good. It wasn't anything incredible but I would have no problem ordering from here again. The pizza was also done exactly when it was supposed to be and the people working the counter (family?) were very nice. I would certainly take this place over any of the big chain pizzas which are almost universally awful."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and was glad we did. Good NY style pizza that is made to order. Not greasy and had that familiar taste from the east coast. Similar to Rays pizza and I'd say it's in the same ballpark as Rays when it comes to flavor and price. 

Clean facility, easy to find and plenty of parking out front. The staff was very friendly and helpful with all my questions. 

I would say this is a winner for the Surprise pizza scene and would encourage people to visit this place."}
{"text":"This unassuming neighborhood Italian restaurant provides fresh fantastic standards with delivery. My favorite the Chicken Parmesan is one of the best. My wife swears by their sandwiches and pasta with meatballs. The boys and I plow through  pizza pies on a regular basis. Fun, friendly and great family feel. I highly recommend anything off the menu!!! Thanks Lucky's!!!!

Your friends in 2241!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. Perfect. My veggie Pizza was ehhhhhh... when i took a slice,  everything fell off the pizza. I was bummed.  :/  The baked ziti was magnificent, no joke. Best baked ziti I have ever had!!!!!!!!!!! The side salad was good.  I said no olives on it......... and I got olives on it. 

Great customer service. Very friendly :)

Games on. Kings vs mavericks. What a good night. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. 2 slices and a coke for lunch great deal. It's my style pizza. Have been there many times and will be back. Family operated this place is the real deal. Been coming here a few years now. The year regulars great and the good is consistent. I'm from Chicago. This is New York style and it's so good. I come in at least twice a week. 2 slices and a pop in under 5 bucks."}
{"text":"I admit it.  I'm a pizza snob.  I grew up in New Jersey and know the difference between good pizza and bad pizza.  Good pizza is \"anything you could serve in Lodi, N.J. and not have your body found in the dumpster behind the store the next morning.\"  Bad pizza constitutes about 99.999% of the rest of the pizza in the world.  

Having voluntarily moved out of N.J. at age 18 to attend college (I didn't feel the need to major in herpes, Camaro repair, or ab workouts, so my options were severely limited there), I was taken aback at the culinary wasteland that exists west of the Passaic river.  I found this abomination called \"frozen pizza\" in grocery stores under names like Red Baron and the very appropriately named \"Tombstone.\"  I found racks of pizza-like-substances in truck stops, obviously part of a nefarious plan to punish the bathroom attendants working there.  And worst of all, there were restaurants called \"Pizza Hut,\" which emanated a neon red siren-call to me as I drove down the highway.  In what I attribute mostly to road-hypnosis (staring at the white dotted line for hours at a time), the talking koala bear in my passenger seat finally convinced me to stop at one of these places.  After being slapped back into reality by ingesting over a half-gallon of pure grease, and utterly disgusted with my furry friend's trickery, I snuck out when he went to the little-koala-bear's-room and peeled out of the parking lot, sticking him with the bill.  I hope washing those dishes ruined his fur.  

From that point on, rather than return to New Jersey (as if that were a viable option), I decided to scour the vast majority of this great nation in search of edible pizza.  I spent many of those years living with soul-crushing disappointment.  

Lucky for me, I finally found Lucky's.  The owners have cleverly tucked this gem away in a strip mall 20+ miles out of the burgeoning metropolis that is Phoenix, Arizona, where damn near no one who lives in the entire valley will ever find it.  Hell, most people who live in Phoenix couldn't find Surprise without a GPS, so the chances of someone from Mesa or Chandler wandering in are roughly the same as being given the winning Powerball ticket by a lonely koala covered in pizza grease and dishwashing detergent.  

After one taste, I was hooked.  After living less than a mile away from the place for the past decade, I'm pretty sure I've financed at least one of the cars parked outside of it.  Mercifully, they don't deliver, otherwise I'm not sure I could fit through my front door at this point.  

From reading other yelp reviews, it appears that Lucky's has other items on the menu.  I never noticed."}
{"text":"Absolute pizza lover here!
Came here as a spur of the moment with my boyfriend last week.  We LOVE pizza and are always trying to try new places to become our new \"usuals\".  

Lucky's is now on our list!  The family owned eatery had amazing, kind, and fast service.  The pizza itself was delicious; the sauce AMAZING; the ranch dressing (an important aspect) AMAZING.  

The breadsticks were by far some of my most favorite thus far. 

Amazing New York pizza right here in little ol' Peoria Arizona.   We will definitely be returning, and I cannot wait to try the white pizza.

Thank you for making our dinner so enjoyable. :D"}
{"text":"I had a strong pizza craving and I didn't feel like driving too far.  My buddy Kate M. had written a review about Lucky's Pizza awhile back and I noticed they were close (still not sure if they are owned by the same folks or not) by so I decided to give them a try.  I called up and placed my order for a Large Cheese Pizza.  They don't ask for your name or phone number, instead they give you a number and tell you how long it will be.  I was told I was #7 and that it would be 15 minutes.  I drove on down, walked inside, paid the lady my money and took my pizza to go.  Friendly folks working there.  Now onto the pizza..............

Large Cheese Pizza ($12.95)-  This thing was nice and big.  The first thing I noticed was that it had a ton of cheese on it.  It also had a little \"sheen\" to it.  That can be bad sometimes if the pizza is too greasy.  This was not the case here.  No drips of grease anywhere to be found.  I picked up my first slice and noticed that it was just a tad droopy.  I bit in though and was pleasantly Surprise(d) Arizona.....bwahahaha... The taste was great.  Good cheese, good sauce, decent crust.  Next time I come back, I will ask them to cook it well done.  If the cheese had a little brown on it and the crust had just a tad bit of a \"crisp\", this pizza would have been fantastic!  It was good as is, but could be taken to another level with an extra few minutes in the oven.  This pizza is one of those types that does get better the more you eat though.  First slice I liked, second slice I ate faster, third slice I started to pick up little subtleties that convinced me it was a pretty darn good pizza.  Is it comparable to my favorite, Grimaldis?  Nope.   Is it way better than any chain type place?  Yep!  Will I come back because its a good value, its a local business, it tasted pretty good and its close to my house?  Definitely!  They have multiple specials going on at all times plus they have sandwiches, wings and appetizers.  They make a Sicilian type pizza too that I definitely want to try out.  They have a decent sized eat in area too.  I'm sure Ill be back in due time."}
{"text":"Love Pizzas and wings definitely we will be back to eat. Customer are very friendly. Beer to cold as well"}
{"text":"Lucky's is THE BEST!!! Their slices are pure heaven-crunchy, NY style thin crust, perfect ratio of cheese to sauce and toppings that you really want!
Benny, the owner makes you feel so welcome the moment you arrive and his lovely young family often on premises make dining-in so friendly and \"at home.\" 
Lunch and dinner specials are a great deal and sports are available on 3 large screens daily.

\"LUCKY\" for me-this is my neighborhood, go-to spot for the best pizza around-go there now!!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Thin with plenty of cheese.  We only got a cheese pizza, but it was good and we will be back.  Service was great and all were friendly."}
{"text":"This place is now my favorite pizza joint in the area. It was DELICIOUS!!! We got the extra large one topping with 20 wings for 24.99 deal for delivery. Got pepperoni and the wings sloppy. The delivery driver was super nice. The food came hot. I'm super picky about my wings and LOVED their wings. And the pizza was sooooo good. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Since moving to Surprise from Ohio this has become our go to place for real east coast pizza. The Sicilian pizza is our favorite but the kids really enjoy the thin crust as well. I would highly recommend giving them a try if you are looking for a very good and not to over the top expensive place to get a great pie."}
{"text":"Ordered via Yelp. Was easy to order menu was easy to understand. After placing and paying for the order I called in to verify they received the order. They read the order back to me and everything was correct. I arrived to pick it up after 20 minutes and ended up waiting a few minutes as it wasn't ready  (no big deal, I like fresh pizza) I should've checked the pizza before I left as it was incorrect. My wife is a vegetarian and half the pizza should've been only cheese but we ended up with an extra large meat pizza and my wife ended up skipping dinner. The wings were great, a little small, but taste wise they were excellent. The pizza was soggy which was weird because the crust was very crunchy and good. For being an extra large 20$ pizza it was also a little short on cheese. All in all this place is okay but overpriced. With as many pizza options as there are I, personally, will not be returning.

Pizza gets 2/5 stars
-1 (soggy)
-1 (incorrect)
-1 (not enough cheese)

Wings get 4/5 stars
-1 (small)

For an average of 3 stars"}
{"text":"Lucky's is great. The ingredients are fresh and it's always a good pie. You can't beat their lunch special. It's a nice alternative to the big chain pizza places. Try their lasagna too, it's really good."}
{"text":"Not bad pizza just kinda regular. way Better than dominos or little ceasers. For the price though it gets 3 stars. The crust could have been a little softer, it was delivered quick and hot though."}
{"text":"True NY pizza. So good. We were just visiting AZ, and I have been wanting this pizza again ever since we left. Open a store in orange county, CA! We have nothing that ever comes close to this pizza. Mmm...."}
{"text":"The real deal when it comes to NY style pizza.......I think the owner's are New Yorker's (maybe I'm wrong.....i just get that impression), so that makes it even better.  We've been eating their pizza and wings for 4 years now.  Something I like just as much as their pizza and wings is their consistency.  It's always the exact same food, time after time.  We never get any surprises."}
{"text":"Im obsessed with this place at the moment. Chicken bacon ranch pizza is amazing. The stuffed style meat pizza is amazing. Their wings and salads are amazing. Customer service is amazing. Stellar choice in an area that is heavily populated with independent pizza joints. My go to place from now on."}
