{"text":"I eat here every week for lunch with a lunch group (their choice, not mine).  The lunch menu is changed weekly and always includes Pad Thai and a curry dish (number 4).  All can be made vegetarian.  The lunch comes with a spring roll and soup.  I enjoy both.  My favorite meal is when number 4 is green curry with eggplant and green beans.  It is spicy- beware!  The service can be hit or miss but I can easily order, eat and pay within 50 minutes.  As a parent, I have gotten quite good at scarfing down a meal...  In the summer this restaurant is HOT.  And I don't mean hot as in crowded and covered with paparazzi, I mean they keep the AC at 78 degrees... sit in the main dining room rather than the sunnier side -room to keep from completely melting down- figuratively and literally.  Sadly, the food has declined in quality.  What was once a 4 star establishment is now a 3 star restaurant.    Go get your curry on!"}
{"text":"Until tonight, I have never understood my husband's obsession with Angel Wings. For all the years I've known him, virtually every time we've ordered Thai takeout (which was quite often in San Francisco) he's doggedly opted for these weird deep-fried chicken wings stuffed with all manner of whatnot, They've always seemed greasy, bland despite the long list of ingredients, an affront to the explosion of flavor that I associate with Thai food.  Tonight, however, when he took me to Thai Orchid in his old stomping grounds in Charlotte, I finally got it. These were made with a level of love not ever seen before in the fried Thai chicken department. The secret seems to be steaming your de-boned stuffed wings so they stay wonderfully moist, then bathing them in a buttermilk batter before you deep-fry them. Man, they were good.    For my part, I played it safe but successfully with a chicken pad khing sod, which included ginger, mushroom, snow peas, green onions and napa cabbage. It was also very flavorful, just the right amount of ginger.  My main quibble with our dining experience was that they served us way too fast! It's not always a good thing to be sat, served and delivered your check in 47 minutes. This is not necessarily the place to come for a long, lingering dining experience. That said, the people were nice as could be and we'll back back whenever we're next in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I saw the other reviews and am surprised that my experience was so vastly different. I came in one Thursday night.-a single female They were not busy yet I had to ask for someone to take my order after waiting 15-20 minutes. My menu was closed after a couple of minutes and the wait staff had to keep walking past me since the table I was seated at was near the entrance to the secondary room that seemed more popular with diners so it was not a simple case of oversight.  After serving my food, no one ever checked on me again (not one time) and I had to flag someone down to get my check-even though I waited a while after I had pushed my plate away. (Remember, the staff was passing by my table every few minutes)  I was very disappointed in the service and could not help to  wonder if I would have been given better service if I was not a female diner eating by myself.  By the way, the food was okay nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Amazing food at a great price. One of the most important things to me is the bang for your buck, and for a very affordable price you get great portions that are delicious. The chicken with rice paper wraps were delicious, and the spring rolls are to die for. A great place for a quick bite to ear for an affordable price."}
{"text":"I come here every week just to get my panang curry fix! Best I've ever had. Their lunch special is a great value."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best Thai restaurant at which I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Quality food, well-prepared, and excellent friendly service.  Everything on the menu is consistently excellent!"}
{"text":"I went with my wife last night for a quick dinner.  Prices are better than other thai spots around here, but not as low as this ex-new yorker is used to paying.  We sat out in the covered porch area, which was good because the inner section of the restaurant had a old, stale smell to it.  Otherwise the decor and ambience was fine - it is more of a place for older people, not trendy at all, which is fine by me.  The food was meh.  The spring rolls were plain but fine.  My wife loved both the Thai beer and her coco-milk soup, however my pad thai was cloying sweet, without the acidic notes of tamarind or lemon.  It wasnt bad at all, but nothing special at all.    The service was fine, though the one waitress passed a few times to ask us if we wanted more beer even though our glasses were still over half-full.   It is hard to find in the shopping complex, not right on Providence Road as our GPS was telling us.  If I need a quick Thai fix in the area I might do it again, but otherwise probably not."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite place to go for pad thai!! Their curry dish here is good as well. The only issue I have w/ this place is the slow service. Sometimes its really bad and if you get something spicy, be prepare to not have your water refill quickly enough!"}
{"text":"Two words: MANGO SALAD  OMG BEST EVER!!!! I order this whenever I have close family I want to feel special.   It blows their socks off. Its my secret gem.  Its so good, I 'treat myself' with it."}
{"text":"The BEST Thai food I'd found in Charlotte.  The mango sticky rice is eyes-roll-to-the-back-of-the-head delicious!  And the non-dessert items are good too! Friendly owners and service.  Prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"Thai Orchid is a great dinner option in the SouthPark neighborhood. My husband had the Pad Thai and reported that it was the best in town, but not the best ever. I had the red curry. It had a nice slow heat and a good mix of veggies. Portions were of a good size, and the price was fair for the neighborhood.  When we visited, the restaurant was busy, but we were serviced in a timely manner. The wait staff were friendly and attentive. The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, but also feels private and not like you are sitting on top of the next table. Oh, and I really liked the wallpaper, which I realize is kind of a strange thing to say about a restaurant."}
{"text":"Arrived at restaurant at 840p.  Restaurant owner yelled \"we close at 9\".  I asked what do you want me leave?  Will you kick me out?  He repeated himself.  \"We close at 9\".  I was about to leave when a lady said that she would serve me.  Food was okay not great.  My less than warm welcome left a bad taste.  Felt very unwelcome."}
{"text":"Edit: Avoid the fresh veggie spring rolls. For $5.95 I got two rolls about 6 inches in length and no more than 1.5 inch diameter. They were like toddler-sized. Inside was lettuce, noodles, and tofu. Fresh and tasty but a total rip-off for $6!   Previously: Love this place. Make a foodie call.com delivers their food to my place. While the delivery service is extremely slow- the food is absolutely worth it. I love their pad thai, pad seeewe noodles. I also love their squid salad and fresh spring rolls. Tom yum soup is very sweet salty tasty! I love this place for authentic thai food. Will hopefully get into their actual place. But for now will deal with the slow delivery."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The family has eaten here since back in 1987 when they were off central.  The meekrab (sp?) is the owner's unique dish you can't find anywhere else and it is absolutely fabulous.  I could just eat that appetizer alone and be happy.  They also have some great selections in curries from red, yellow, green and the cocunut curry.  They will also adjust anything to your spice level--from mouth on fire to mild.  All the dishes can also be made vegetarian.  The customer service is great--they remember me each time I place a to go order to when I show up with friends."}
{"text":"Great food, I order take out often from this place and they have nice portion sizes, dinner and lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Overpriced tasteless fake Thai food.  Service wasn't great either.  Shrimp dishes were overcooked and chewy.  Pan fried noodles were rubbery southern style thick wide pastry strips.  Not enough properly cooked vegetables in soup and/or entrees."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Charlotte.  I have been a customer ever since the owners ran a Thai restaurant on Central Ave.  I used to travel to Asia a good deal and one of my Thai customers visited me here in Charlotte.  I tried taking him to several different Charlotte restaurants, but he always pulled out a bottle of tabasco sauce that he carried with him.  Taking the hint I decided to take him to Thai Orchid and he was extremely impressed.  He ordered all the dishes Thai native spicy and we ate outside in the 95 degree heat. (this was back in the day when they had an outdoor patio).  I would have rather eaten inside, but he was as happy as a clam eating spicy food outside in the middle of July.  He loved their food and said it was the best meal he had eaten since he had been in the US.  Some of my favorites are:  mee krob, squid salad, chicken larb, kang dang curry, green curry special, pad thai and the boneless chicken wings.  The service is very friendly as well -- they don't call Thailand the \"land of smiles\" for nothing, and these folks carry on that tradition."}
{"text":"The men at the restaurant were very nice. The decor was nice. The restaurant has a nice ambiance. The bathroom could have been cleaner.   We got the chili chicken lunch special, the luncheon delight lunch special and the pad Thai lunch special.  I cannot stress this enough : the pad Thai was horrible. Save yourself and don't order it. The shrimp tasted like it was just defrosted -no flavour. The chicken was strange. It tasted like ketchup noodles and had egg shells in it. The upside: it was well-presented on the plate, came with a spring roll and a drink.  The luncheon delight had satay sticks and they were all well seasoned. The shrimp were slightly burnt, but I didn't mind. The vegetables were drenched in a mystery brown sauce and were not good. The rice didn't seem to have a place in the meal. It was served with a peanut sauce and that was good.  The chili chicken was in a brown sauce that had tasted like soy sauce mixed with black pepper and chili peppers. It had a nice flavour, better than the chili chicken at tangerine.   Overall, i would not recommend these particular dishes, maybe I would say try the chili chicken if you're in the mood for it.   To be fair - maybe their other dishes are better. It was just these particular dishes that we tried and can rate."}
{"text":"Food: the food was good, my only complaint is that they use the bare minimum when it comes to there ingredients. You really don't get the full effect of the Thai dishes. If it you want better portions & consistency, this is not the place. Service: I waited until my second time eating here to make my review and this is the conclusion that iv come to.   The service is lacking N HERE's WHY! 1. The workers look at you like you're  crazy when u walk in instead of asking how many ppl and where would we like to sit.  2. I also Noticed that they separate the Caucasian ppl from the rest (non-white), by sitting anyone of ethic background outside when there's plenty of room to sit in doors. Not sure how Asians can be racist or bias to any group of ppl. But I seen it with my own eyes. 3. They never check back with us once the food came out. You have to physically track one of the workers down or go the the desk to and ask for a refill or napkins ect.   Like I said I never like to write a bad review and always try to give the facility to make up for their lack or service, quality of food and professionalism. We all have bad days but it shouldn't be consistent, not if you want returning customers."}
{"text":"Thai Orchid is absolutely my favorite Thai restaurant in Charlotte.  I have been going there for 10 years and have never had less than a fantastic experience.  The staff are friendly, service is quick, and the food knocks out all of the competition.  The atmosphere is less sophisticated (but more interesting) than pricier Thai restaurants whose food cannot compare.  They are also really helpful and knowledgeable when customers have dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Great place for Thai   My wife and I along with our friends were delighted with the ambiance   The service   Food and helpful staff. We had the golden sqid which was fantastic.  The green curry chicken was absolutely delicious.  The service from start to end was top notch. Would recommend this restaurant without question.  They will see us back."}
{"text":"Best best Thai I've found in charlotte. The atmosphere is welcoming and friendly. And the food very flavor filled. Order #32 with a fried egg added and you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was very young. The owners are fantastic and the food is always great."}
{"text":"Our DINNER's SERVED group has been here twice and will go back again. Cashew chicken was excellent. Service could be a little better but for a small restaurant we understood the delay in getting our meals"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, best Pad Thai and fried rice we've had at any restaurant. The food came quickly, and the prices were reasonable. Our server was friendly but did not crowd us. No complaints, only thanks."}
{"text":"I use to go Thai Orchid frequently when I was working in Pickering and living in Ajax. Mostly for pickup food. The food was always good. I recently went back and the food was terrible, not tasting as before and poor quality. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai cuisine that's very reasonably priced, they've been around the neighborhood forever and are always delivering awesome quality at great prices."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT here!!! We ordered last night. My boyfriend hadn't eatin since lunch around noon. He got home late and we went to pick up the food around 8pm. He got the number 20 with seafood. About an hour later he spent the entire night throwing up and having diarrhea. I called first thing in the morning to warn them and the manager was EXTREMELY rude. Didn't care and kept saying \"well what can I do about it\" I told him he probably should not sell that batch of soup and at least refund that meal. He would not do anything and said there is no way of knowing it was from his food. So disappointed, what awful service."}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon for this restaurant so I figured I'd give it a go!   The first thing that stood out to me was the phenomenal service at this location! Great, kind staff from the waitress to the manager! We really appreciated their attentiveness and assistance with ordering.  The fried rice dishes were large and tasty! The shrimp still had the tails on it which was a little tough to dig around in the rice.   Great presentation of food and great flavor."}
{"text":"What a great lunch stop, food was spicy and fresh. The service was friendly and the elephant table cloths and orchid attire is fitting for the name  My choice: chicken pad Thai, delicious and hot served for lunch with an spring roll an soup. 4 star experience tasty and prompt"}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch and definitely will be back. Nestled in between the shops and restaurants in the center, it may be hard to find for a first timer.   Warmly welcomed by the guy at the register, invited us to have a seat in the 'indoor' patio area which was quite nice. The selections are typical for Thai food in the America but some I have never seen before or heard of. Straying away from the norm, I opted for a lunch dish chosen pretty much by closing my eyes and picking.  They were pretty fast at getting the food out and the dishes did not disappoint.  I wish I was closer or I'd come here more often. Definitely a must do if you are nearby and hungry for some Thai."}
{"text":"I have the Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai like once a week at least. I always order pick up and the food is ready very quickly. Sometimes the customer service is prompt yet gruff but that's okay with me, the food is always yummy. I've never ate in - just pick up or delivery. Definitely a staple in my household!"}
{"text":"The food is great but owner/ male staff is prejudice and rude - every time I visit he was so rude - I call to order green curry - the male act as if he had no clue what what green curry was - then told me we have red and green curry - I ask for green curry Thai - he act as if he had not clue what green curry Thai was - he is prejudice towards blacks - do not go there- he is lucky to be in US"}
{"text":"The menu has a ton of variety.  It's terribly delicious.  The service is good.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place still has some of the best lunch specials in the Southpark area.  Before I spent two weeks in Thailand, I thought it was great.  Now I just think it is one of the best choices in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Picked up takeout here this past week and was really impressed, not only with the establishment and service, but also how busy the place was on a Tuesday night. This made me more excited for the meal! Located right behind Fresh Market on Providence/Sardis area, the place is small, but cozy. I called in ahead, so I just walked up to the counter and gave them my name. The food came out right away. There is no bar area, so don't plan on getting a drink while you wait for your order.   Ordered Pad Thai, Pad Woon Sen & Fresh Rolls (spring rolls on steroids). All this for $28. Not bad, as I've paid more and less for the same order at other restaurants. Surprisingly, I got a side of white rice too? Not sure if this is typical or a mistake?   Got home and dove right in as I was starving. Food was really good and the portions were huge. Made for great lunch the next day. Ordered both dishes \"medium spicy\" and the Pad Thai came with a little more heat than the Pad Woon Sen, which was fine as the Pad Thai was for the lady.   I'm a fan and will be back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined at every thai restaurant in charlotte. This is by far the very best. The restaurant provides a more upscale feel without the price tag. The food is fantastic and the service OMG it can not be matched. We are very picky about our thai food. Believe me no other thai restaurant in town touches this place."}
{"text":"On a recent snowy Friday night, I went to Thai Orchid for the first time for some take-out. The place was very quiet. I did have to wait a long time before I could place my order, because staff was on the phone taking a long order. Wait time for the food was good. When I got home, the dishes were all pretty good. Not over-the-top great, but good and tasty nevertheless."}
{"text":"Great food in a sleepy setting. Don't come for the atmosphere...come for the consistently good thai food."}
{"text":"Honestly I hate to say this, but this is the worst Thai food I have ever had in my life. The pad Thai was horrible. The noodles tasted like they were pre cooked and then heated up in the microwave. The pad see ew had a bizarre taste and they didn't add any spice to it even though it was ordered extra spicy. The fried dumplings were gross too way too much ginger and not your traditional ones. Over priced especially for the quality. I can't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Pros: Good food, locally-owned & not a chain restaurant, authentic, fresh food, full of flavor.   Cons: Moderately pricey but not too bad, kind of hidden in the strip.   Overall: Tasty and totally worth it, really enjoyed the food. My dining partner has been to Thailand multiple times and agreed the food was \"delightful.\" Worth another trip for sure."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since it opened years ago & i've had everything on their menu. The best items I find are the Thai Coconut Milk Mushroom Soup, Thai Beef Salad (which has a lil kick to it), Siam Eggplant Dish that consists of ground chicken, the eggplant of course & shrimp. It is to die for! Also the Red & Green curries are a must to try. For dessert the Sweet Sticky Rice garnished with mango & colored coconut shavings is a nice way to finish off your meal. It gets crowded on the usual busy days so I recommend getting there at a good time as its a small place & fills up fast"}
{"text":"I ordered Yellow Beef Curry with Coconut Rice and my mom chose Curry Ayam(mild curry chicken, salad and rice). I'd never had coconut rice before, but it was yummy; almost too sweet. The yellow curry was perfect and the beef very tender. My mom loved the chicken curry. Not too spicy and loaded with flavour. We both took doggy bags home which made for a delicious lunch the next day.   It was empty when we arrived, but we just beat the lunch rush. It became busier with customers dining in and picking up take out orders; always a good sign! It's not a large space, but it is intricately decorated in rich colours. I enjoyed that we were not all crammed in like sardines.   If you're in Pickering and have a hankering for Thai, drop by the Thai Orchid. I'd absolutely go back."}
{"text":"This cute little native Thai family-owned restuarant is a Charlotte staple and it has been tucked away in the center of the Strawberry Hill shopping center for at least the past  12 -15 years (if not longer).   Most of the time, the service is good, but there have been a few misses in this department when they are extremely busy. However, overall I am pleased with the food and service and can overlook the occasional off-day.   They offer several lunch specials which come with a spring roll or egg roll. They also start you out with a small soup of the day which varies.    I really like their pad thai here and often get it when I am here for lunch since its usually one of the lunch specials.  For dinner, I like their curries -especially the Penang Curry.  (I have only had one really bad meal here and sadly I cannot remember what I ordered on that visit, but it wasn't one of my \"normal' favs.)   They season their food for the \"American palate\" so if you like it spicier, just let them know and they will bump it up for you.   The portions are definitely generous, so I usually have leftovers... I love getting 2 meals for the price of one!  :-)"}
{"text":"We hit up this quaint little spot last night to celebrate the birthday of Mr. Poprock Photography. :D  Needless to say, it's nestled away in a shopping center that pops up out of nowhere (especially in the dark).  It's really small, but adorable! I felt like I was walking into someone's home.  At 7 PM, they weren't busy; it was a bit awkward for it to be so quiet, even with music playing in the background.  Luckily, Tonya & Billy are foodies like my boyfriend & I, so we sampled quite a few of Thai Orchid's offerings.    Fresh rolls: Heaven on a plate. I am such a big fan of fresh (spring) rolls & these were amazing.  First of all, they were HUGE! Packed tight & full of ingredients. The peanut sauce was spicy & hot & a perfect compliment.  Spring rolls: Just the right amount of crunch & ingredients. The spicy sauce was hot & spicy, too.  Chicken wings: Cooked perfectly & again, the accompanied sauce was yes, hot & spicy!  Tonya & I both agreed it would have been tastier if they tossed the wings in the sauce prior to serving. Maybe next time, we can ask politely. :)  I had the shrimp fried rice, which wow, the medium sized plate was overflowing with rice goodness.  I was a little taken a back due to having tomato chunks in it, as well as the shrimp having their tails still on.  Due to snacking away on appetizers, I was unable to finish my rice, but Shawn will enjoy it for lunch.   Shawn, Tonya & Billy all enjoyed their dishes of flounder, jasmine rice, & Chicken Pad Phed.    Our waitress was nice & checked on us just the right amount.  Our water glasses stayed full.  Like Nicole, I am giving 3.5 stars, but bumping up to 4 for the appetizers & portions."}
{"text":"Great Service, Great Food.  Was in a hurry and they got us in/out of there quick and the food was fantastic.  Will go again when I'm in the area!  Hidden Gem!"}
{"text":"Best mango salad! Love this place, never disappoints ! Will be going here more often!"}
{"text":"The fish and pad Thai here is awesome! I didn't have a good dining experience here for my first visit but I decided to give it another try. It happened to be I didn't order the right dishes. Try pad tai and fish!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and we called ahead for pick up since its close to the office.  I ordered the marinated chicken and spring rolls, my colleague ordered the pad thai with chicken.  We swapped a taste of each just to experience something different.  The spring rolls were nice and crispy, with a nice flavor as expected however the pad thai was very good but i would personally have preferred a thinner noodle but it was still good.  As for the marinated chicken, it was very good.  Nice and tender, with a strong garlic flavor.  I was impressed.  I think i will return some time soon."}
{"text":"This was our second time here. We love the chicken satay with peanut sauce and cucumbers. That's the only appetizer we've had here and we love it. My husband got some fried noodle bowl thingy and it was very hard for him to figure out where to start LOL, literally. He didn't get a lot of sauce with his meal so he was kind of disappointed with that. I got the garlic pepper shrimp and it was actually really tasty. It is something I could definitely have again. The restaurant was clean and the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Only had a couple things at this attractive little restaurant - a soup and spring rolls - but I have definitely had better!  The service could be a little more relaxed.  I think I'll stick with Thai House."}
{"text":"I had ordered yellow curry fried rice..and when I opened the take out box was shocked to see the so called fried rice with just shredded chicken and just \"2\" raw shrimps on top.... Never expected this from Thai orchid and you charge 14 dollar for this!!!!! Will never visit again !!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai Food, Service, and Atmosphere.  The pineapple fried rice with spring roll was delicious.  Number 32 with chicken was very tasty and spicy. The server and owner were very friendly and helpful with recommendations."}
{"text":"Ordered in for mothers day. On a super busy night they told me delivery was going to take 1.5 hours to 2 hours. I anticipated a slow delivery so it was fine by us. Delivery came in 1 hour 10 mins which was pretty awesome considering.   We ordered satay chicken skewers, basil chicken, peanut chicken curry and mee foon goreng. They were all delicious! Peanut chicken curry was my favorite and it had a bit of a kick to it but evened out with the basil chicken. It was way too much food for just the two of us (and one toddler) but a delightful variety."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars, rounded up to 5 because of their sublime Pad Thai!  Let me cut to the chase, the Pad Thai here is the best I've had in Charlotte! PERFECT blend of Sweet Heat, fish sauce, spices and herbs. Very tasty and perfectly cooked noodles made this a delectable dish!  Also got their Beef Basil Stir Fry which was outstanding, and a Thai Omelet with a red tomato based sauce with chicken and veggies.  The little Thai waitress was adorable, friendly and attentive. I actually had my FIRST Thai red wine...and it was pretty good! Had NO idea what I was drinking but it sure was tasty!  This is a small restaurant but I came early before it got crowded. This place has been in business for at least 15 years and apparently it has survived in the very competitive food scene for a reason: Their food is EXCELLENT! And not too hard on the wallet either.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Elegant interior, if you can find this hidden restaurant nestled deep in an alley of the Strawberry Hill Shopping Center.  Decor could be a bit overdone, but there is an air of elegance and there is always take-out.  Look for the sandwich board and then for white pillars...that's the place.  Prices are a bit high, but the food is OK Thai and the menu covers the typical array of Thai dishes.  Portions are reasonable, but on the small size given their prices.  Their spring rolls are excellent and we usually order a dozen.  They are firmly wrapped and fired just right, without oozing oil.  Their curries are excellent and for those that like the Thai standard Pad dishes, which I don't, you will be pleased.  I like how you can order your dish and then amplify it with beef, chicken, shrimp or have it meatless.    Spiciness is very mild.  I ordered spicy, the two pepper logo, and it was not spicy at all.  Live dangerously and insist on spice and they certainly can melt your inlays, but if you like spice, mention it and ask them to jazz it up a bit.  Sooner or later I will come up with the right-for-me level of spice.  You can dress up here and one will see families so attired, also couples on dates wearing more than t-shirts and flip-flops.  Your call."}
{"text":"Their hot & sour soup and lunch specials were very good. Decent cleanliness."}
{"text":"This is another restaurant in my ongoing quest to eat as much Pad Thai as possible!  I didn't know there was a place in Pickering, so I thought I would check it out. This place is in the middle of a strip mall, a little bit past the Pickering Town Center. The decoration is nice, very themes, and the service was good.  The Seafood Soup was decent, I found it odd they called it \"Thai Seafood Soup\" and no Tom Yum soup. It was pretty much the same thing. they didn't have coriander that was the only difference. It tasted good though.  The Pad Thai... it smelled like Ketchup. Yea, I said it. It was bland, they didn't ask for how spicy we wanted it (I should know to leave when this happens). It was sweet, and it tasted like Ketchup. For those of you who don't know, you're supposed to use Tamarind. Some recipes say \"use ketchup if you can't get Tamarind\". I might excuse the substitution in like BFE because they weren't able to get Tamarind. However, this restaurant does not have this excuse. They say it's authentic, but the Ketchup smell and taste told me different.   In summary, the restaurant was a solid three, not great, not bad. Until the Ketchup Pad Thai, which pulled it down. I won't say it's horrible and the worst I have had. I just wouldn't go back, or suggest it to others."}
{"text":"The food at Thai Orchid is mediocre - period- full stop. I've been an occasional customer for years and I have never had a dish I would consider well-prepared with quality ingredients. Why do I return? Because of convenience - I live within walking distance and sometimes we want something quick to bring home to eat. The other evening we picked up cold duck salad, crispy fried rolls, Thum Yum soup, and a #38 ginger and veggies with beef. A new low for us. The soup was flavorless; the duck salad was missing the advertised crispy noodles, and the #38 was filling, but boring with limp flavorless vegetables. Plenty of ginger though. The rolls were crisp, but lacked any depth of flavor."}
{"text":"We just moved to Charlotte and have been looking for a place with great Thai food. This place is not for you. It took over 30 minutes to get our noodle dish and over 15 minutes to get our check once we asked for it. They do a lot of to-go business and the dine in people are the ones that suffer. I am only giving 2 stars because I feel bad giving one star."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch one afternoon because my sister-in-law loves Thai and she said coworkers told her this place was good. They were right. Very good lunch special prices around $7 or $8. I had the pad thai and got it medium spicy and it was one of the best pad thai that I have had. Wife had beef with oyster sauce which I tried and was also very tasty. Lunch special comes with iced green tea or hot tea. Service was friendly. Portions are large. I would definitely visit again and recommend this for Thai food."}
{"text":"Based on last night's meal, and easy Five yelp stars.  This may be unfair because I have been to this restaurant so many times over the last eight years and I know what I like and what to avoid!  This food is extremely consistent!  Every time each dish is as it was on previous visits.    First I ordered Fresh Rolls! These are the largest Fresh Rolls of any place I have been!  Their \"Peanut\" Sauce is the most unique, House-made for sure, super thin, sweet and sour with minced peanuts on top.  The Fresh Rolls earn 4.5 stars and the Peanut Sauce gets 4.1 stars.  One of my Favorite Thai Dishes (when it is done well) is stir fried Thai Basil with Beef (my friends and I call it Basil Beast)!  What I like about Thai Orchids approach to Beef Basil is the beef is very good, it has very few other ingredients, Garlic, Peppers, Soy based sauce and Thai Basil.  This simple recipe yields one of my favorite versions of this dish!  The Rice is Jasmine I think.  This dish gets an easy 5 yelp stars every time I have eaten it here!!!  For Dessert, Custard with Sticky Rice!  Tastes much better than my photo conveys.  I'm glad I got it though would not order it without a couple of people to share it with and last night I ate it all!!!  I have to keep reminding myself I'm on a diet!"}
{"text":"I continue trying to like this place but am disappointed almost every time. Tonight's take out was red curry; the shrimp are rubbery and the sauce is especially watery. I also ordered spring rolls, got home, and they were both ripped apart and had tofu...menu didn't mention that part! They were a mess (literally) so I took them back and tried to get veggie spring rolls. Apparently your options are either the vegetables with the meat or the tofu with lettuce. If you want the veggies(carrots, cucumbers, etc) you have to get the meat and if you don't want meat you don't get the veggies....makes no sense! My options were pay $5 for something I can't eat/don't like or go without so I asked for a refund.  Lesson learned and I'll stick with Thai House. It's further from my house but I'd rather drive and know the food will be good instead of playing food roulette! $15 for mediocre shrimp curry isn't worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place for years.  The mee krob is delicious, as is their squid salad.  Better at dinner than at lunch, although they have good lunch specials.  I agree that it is the best Thai in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This restaurant helped me find my love for thai food.  The fresh rolls with tofu are my absolute favorite.  I could eat them every day.  Love that this is a hidden gem, tucked away in a shopping center not seen from the main road."}
{"text":"Even the Pad Thai which had tasted great on our first visit now it's not so good. Maybe the chef only works dinners because like on our last visit the food tasted reheated. In fact the sprouts and vegetables were totally limp as if they had the life zapped out of them by the microwave and the dish tasted kind of boring.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.    Update : Came here again for dinner and the food was \"very \" oily ...  I feel very sick right now. Hit and Miss not a good sign for consistency."}
{"text":"I work in the plaza for the last 6 years and their food is and has always been amazing! Love the mango salad and their good service. Hand made and fresh always!"}
{"text":"This place has run its course for me.  From the shotty service to the kitchen that can't get ANYTHING right. Pad Thai, your a Thai restaurant and you can't get pad Thai right???  There aren't any people here and the kitchen got me and my wifes food wrong twice.  Just an awful experience, food was disgusting when they finally got it right.  Every time we come here it's been getting worse, stay away!"}
{"text":"It is never busy here.  Probably because the food is just mediocre.  Not good but not terrible.  In Toronto this restaurant would be totally empty because their are so many better Thai restaurants.  Once every five to ten years is plenty to try.  If you don't know good Thai food then this place might appeal to you."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place too many times to count. Always wanted to try it. Finally did.  The dining area is small but it was pretty busy when we got there, which is usually a good sign. We ordered the pad thai and pineapple fried rice, two dishes every thai restaurant should do well in my opinion. We weren't offered dishes to share -- could have asked, but we made do, it honestly wasn't that important to us.  The pad thai was pretty bland... I didn't detect any coriander or lime; instead it was garnished with green onion and lemon, and could have used more tamarind sauce. Also, not spicy. Not even a little bit. I didn't see a spice rating system on the menu, there was no chili sauce on the table, and we weren't asked what we'd like by our waiter, so I'm not sure if you can even request a certain level of spice. We presumed you can't, but who knows, we didn't ask.  My boyfriend had the pineapple fried rice. It was served with shrimp and had more kick than the pad thai. To be fair, he loved it, said he'd have it again. But I found the rice dry and lacking the sweetness that normally balances the spiciness of the dish. And -- a pet peeve of mine -- the vegetables (peas, carrots, corn) seemed like they came from a frozen mix. Why do restaurants do this? I can always tell the difference.  Food was served hot and fresh, service was good, and the restaurant is really clean, so I'm sure we'll try it again sometime, hopefully with a better result with regards to the food.  I gave it 3 stars, but it was more like a 2.5"}
{"text":"I went to this place again last night and as always I am amazed. I love the location of this place it's nestled in the shopping center in the  shopping center where Fresh Market is located. The setting is very intimate and the decor is fantastic! For my appetizer I ordered the Thai Orchid Spring Rolls the rolls were crispy and delicious and came with a phenomenal peanut sauce. As my entree I ordered the vegetarian Pad Prik King with tofu and it was amazing I requested them to make it spicy and they were able to accomplish that! The dish was full of wonderful veggies in a creamy coconut curry sauce the dish came with rice! Normally I get the pad thai but decided to try something different and I was not disappointed! I would definitely recommend this place the staff is also very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly the prices here are also fairly reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to go in Pickering!  The staff is friendly and the service is good... the FOOD is amazing!  It can fill up fast at dinner time so if you're coming with more than two people, I'd make a reservation.  Our typical dinner at Thai Orchid:  House Appetizer Platter Spicy Beef Salad Chicken Pad Thai Green Chicken Curry (although I still think they should call it Green Curry Chicken!) or...  Peanut Chicken Curry (they're both really good)  The house platter provides a nice variety of flavours consisting of: One Spring Roll, Cold Spring Roll (cut in half), Calamari (which surprizingly, is quite good), two Golden Baskets, a skewer each of Chicken & Shrimp Satay, served with special house sauce (which, let's face it, I could just drink on it's own!!) and peanut sauce.  All of the dishes I've tried at this restaurant have been fabulous!  I go here as often as I can and although I usually end up with a $45 bill, there's always plenty to take home for lunch or dinner the next day!  Their lunch menu has a perfect selection and the portion sizes are just right!  I normally order the Green Curry Chicken which comes with a spring roll and a bowl of rice.  Just perfect for lunch!  :)"}
{"text":"I love Thai Orchid! It is such an amazing restaurant. I went for my birthday and I ordered the pineapple dish with chicken and shrimp, it was so beautiful! All the rice and food came in a half cut pineapple, it was an exquisite meal, I felt so special and the waitresses were awesome. Also, I drank the most delectable Thai tea at Thai Orchid. Thank you Thai Orchid for making my birthday dinner awesome and I will always come back when I'm in the mood for excellent Thai food."}
{"text":"Best Thai in south Charlotte. The Chicken Fried rice is awesome. Make sure to add spice. I'm a regular."}
{"text":"I went to this place today with a friend for lunch.  It was a nice experience, nothing mind blowing though.  We had the sampler platter appetizer and the dipping sauces that came with it were really good.  For our entrees we got the curry duck and the pad thai to split.  Both were flavorful but the curry duck was advertised as being spicy and was not spicy at all.  The pad thai was a good dish but was definitely missing something.  I will go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and i wanted to try this restaurant as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. What a huge disappointment. Extremely poor customer service.  The lady behind the counter never once smiled at us. When we walked up to her, she was busy so she pointed at a table and waved her arm to go sit. She then came over to the table and quickly scattered our napkins, forks and threw down our menus before running off.  Again NO smile or greeting. Has she never been trained on how to treat patrons ???? The water she served us wasn't even chilled,  just lukewarm. If you ever get a glimpse at the bottom of the water pitcher that she was carrying, you would be totally disgusted. It was flithy and black with grim and germs. We ordered an appetizer,  2 entrees and rice. The food was mediocre.  At the end, when we paid our bill at the counter she never looked up at us again and just tossed our receipt to us. No \" thank you\" , no smile,  no eye contact !!!  Sorry to have been a disturbance to your day. You certainly have no idea how to make customers feel appreciated and  should change jobs.  If you are comtemplating this restaurant, please do yourself a favour and don't go !!! You will leave regretting ever stepping foot in that restaurant !!"}
{"text":"I ate here one lunch time with a would of coworkers.  The restaurant is somewhat buried inside a small shopping plaza and I would have never had found this place if they hadn't have taken me.  The restaurant itself kind of reminded of someones living room with a side nook posing as a sun room and had an interesting 60's feel --though it did seem clean(ish).  I order their chicken Pad Thai which I thought was great.  It was served very hot and had a good taste to it.  The lunch was quite inexpensive, too.  If I'm ever in the mood this is kind of food, I'd certainly go back here again --if I could find it."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for Thai food and thought I would stop in. It's tucked in to a little shopping mall, so it's a little hard to find. The food was VERY good and the service was excellent. It's nice and quiet and clean. My dining partner and I had fried tofu, Thai tea, and tom kha soup. Delicious!! We did have to ask for spices for our food and for straws, etc. Otherwise, excellent, near perfection."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night and the service was atrocious and the restaurant was only about 50% capacity.  We were about the fourth couple there to complain about the slowness and the lack of attention the wait staff paid to their customers.  The food was below average in terms of other Thai restaurants I have been to. We had the pad Thai, tofu curry and golden tofu. The mocktails and decor were the only things preventing this review from being a 1 star."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to try this place a couple of years now, finally did last night, were not disappointed! Everything we tried was excellent. We had the Mee Krob appetizer (lettuce wraps)"}
{"text":"The service from the start to the finish was fantastic! We were greeted immediately and the waitress got us waters within a minute. When I ordered my beer she came back quickly and poured half into a glass and left the rest for me to pour. That's fine dining etiquette! (I served fine dining for 5 years) would highly recommend if looking for some Thai food!"}
{"text":"I found out about this restaurant through Yelp. It brought me to a new little quaint shopping area I never knew about! It's hidden off of Providence Rd as soon as you pass Fairview Rd on your left. I discovered Phil's Deli and Il Nobe or something like that, an Italian restaurant. I plan to check those out too.   I got the Pad Thai, and it was delicious. Not as big as the Pad Thai from Upstream, but still delicious. Came with an eggroll and some soup. Everything was good, the service was very good and quick. The interior had cute and fancy Thai decor. Very nicely done! Bravo, Thai Orchid."}
{"text":"Not very busy here every time we come.. but give it a try anyway :) it's not bad and the staff are fairly friendly.  The green curry was the first thing we tried. I'd say it's a tad spicy though since I prefer a sweeter and more coconut-y green curry. We found a vegetable sticker in it though :/ the owner apologised and immediately brought out a new dish. :) We really appreciated that! So kind! We also tried yellow curry which I preferred. Nothing special but can help you fill a craving.  My favorite is the mushroom coconut soup here. It's a little spicy with a huge coconut milk flavor that I love! Very sweet and enjoyable. It's quite a large bowl of soup so you can get that to share for sure!  I also enjoyed the pad Thai. It's got that balance of sweet, sour, and savory. You can only have it with chicken and shrimp or seafood, while I usually would prefer beef, but that's okay. The noodles are always cooked to be chewy and flavorful :)  Decent Thai place to visit if you're craving it while in Pickering!"}
{"text":"Decent,  not sure what to think of the place.  We won't be coming back but it was a decent experience.  flavors were lacking and prices were moderate.  Service was ok.  I don't know why i didn't love it, but it was ok.  It's more Chinese fusion than Thai.  Nothing to rave about here."}
{"text":"Best curry in Charlotte! I love that they participate in Foodie Call, so when I can't get out of the office they can come to me! MUST TRY: Mee Krob: Crispy rice noodle topped with chicken, water chestnuts and served with crisp lettuce  MUST TRY: ThumKha: Coconut cream soup with galangal and lemon grass. Your choice of meat (shrimp and chicken are best) MUST TRY: #29. Panang * (spicy!) Panang curry paste in coconut cream, bell peppers, kaffir lime leaves. It comes spicy-getting any hotter than it comes and you will need some icecream afterwards. Just sayin'! Beautiful restaurant located in the shopping center with Fresh Market. They have excellent service and serve wine and beer. Don't know what to order? They'll help you!"}
{"text":"We used to live in Strawberry Hill when we first moved to Charlotte, and haven't been back to Thai Orchid since then (don't know why?). Checked it out again & I'm glad we did.  We started with the fresh rolls - they were really good, especially with the dipping sauce. It had a nice kick!   I had the chicken and shrimp Pad Thai and my husband ventured into something new - the Gai Nei Lung. It looked like a stir fried chicken, vegetable, cashew combo that's served in a really cool fried egg noodle basket. Great presentation! We both thought it was a little bland, but next time we'll ask for it spicier.   They seem to do a lot of takeout orders and I noticed they are part of the Foodie Call service (I've never used it, need to check it out). If you're looking for a new Thai spot, check it out!  P.S. here is the link to their menu: http://www.thaiorchidrestaurantcharlotte.com/exotic-cuisine-services"}
{"text":"I came in last Friday with my wife.  We've been to Thailand before and had everything.  This place is amazing and very authentic.  It's hard to find it but once you find it, it's like finding a pot of gold. We had the traditional pad Thai, which was delicious and flavorful.  The tom yum soup is probably my favorite.  It's full of flavor and spices.  Their currys are very good also.  The staff was very friendly.  We felt like we were in Thailand without the beaches.  Definitely my favorite place for Thai food."}
{"text":"I've been pack twice since my review from 6 years ago now that I live here.  Tonight I treated myself to fresh spring rolls, green Curry, and mango sticky rice.  The online menu didn't seem to list the price of the sticky rice ($6.95).  I made sure on my order by phone that it was available/in season.  The guys said yes but the mango was so bitter.  Pretty much a rip off because it's not meant to taste tart.  The green curry was good and they gave a hearty amount but would have been even better if they filled the tall cup toward the rim for the value.  The fresh spring rolls was about a normal price and was excited to see peanut sauce n' vinegary spice sauce inside.  My review years ago was about pad Thai which was a popular foodie item back then. So I'm more familiar with that dish now."}
{"text":"We got the take out pad see ew tonight. It was not great. The typical pas see ew we've had has a sweet, brown, thick soy sauce. This was a very loose and spicy clear sauce."}
{"text":"Thai Orchid is probably the restaurant closest to home, close enough to walk to. I used to pop in here more often but with new restaurants popping up all over the place and so many choices, it's been a while since I've been here.  On this visit, I dropped in for some takeout and ordered the Thai Spicy Noodles with chicken, one of my favourite dishes from this place. It's rice noodles with onions, peppers (hot and spicy), and chicken. It's also available with beef or tofu.  It tasted as good as in the past but I don't remember it being this spicy. I was sweating! And I like spicy food. I do, however, recall that the portion used to be larger. Or is that my poor memory?"}
{"text":"Great portion size, but the pad Thai and the pad see ew are a bit dry. Still worth the money as two could easily split one dish."}
{"text":"Pad see ew was very bland. I had to make my own sauce and pour it over once I got home. All of the noodles were also stuck together so it was very hard to eat. I probably won't ever go back again."}
{"text":"This place was not great at all. I had the Red curry and it was really thick and tasted nothing like red curry does. I also had the Thai iced tea and it was overly sweet when I requested it not to be sweet when I ordered it."}
{"text":"I bought a Livingsocial deal for Thai Orchid. It was a disappointment going to Thai Orchid. It was toally different than what I expected it would be.  This place have the pan fried noodle and it is very rare for restaurants to make the pan fried noodle right. The pan friend noodle was plain taste and nothing special. The noodle soup was bland taste. The vegetable they used in the noodles were cheap. Bunch of cheap onions and baby corn. There were big slice onions not thin onions.The wait staff was nice but honestly the food wasn't good."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good, and it was crowded which indicates to me that the clientele really like it. The decor was nice."}
{"text":"We were here at Thai Orchid tonight after a friend gave us a Wagjag voucher to try out.  Ordered : A10. House Appetizer Platter N2. Seafood Pad Thai  Food was quite good with lots of flavour.  The meat in the House Platter dish was a bit hard though, would have liked them soft and tender.  The Pad Thai was decent but tasted like sweet ketchup.  I have tried better.  The restaurant was quite busy for a thursday evening.  Must be even more busy on weekends.  Not sure if the staff is Thai as they speak Cantonese and look Chinese.  Overall a nice place if you're looking for Thai food in Pickering.  Great atmosphere and close to Pickering Town Centre."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Thai restaurant in two days so I have a good restaurant to compare with. Its almost like a duel or a UFC fight.  Thai Orchid Restaurant VS Hot Mama Noi's Thai on the Fly  Round 1: FIGHT! In terms of the name of the restaurant, I don't even think I need to point out who the winner is......But I will anyways: Hot Mama Noi's Thai on the Fly.  Alright, now lets get on to the actual review. I got my food to go and I thought the service for take-out orders was amazing. The waitress took my order and asked for my name. About 10-15 minutes later the chef walks out and calls my name. I wasn't just a number. I was a person. A simple thing like asking for my name impressed me. Its the little things that count.   Chicken Satay $5.25 - two skewers, the chicken was dry, the portions pretty large and the peanut dipping sauce I would prefer smaller chunks of peanut. Don't really recommend.  Seafood Pad Thai $10.95 - portion is decent size, great balance of sweet and sour, wasn't much seafood and the shrimps were still in their infant stages of life. In other words they were super tiny. I didn't get around to counting all the shrimps this time around because infant shrimps are not worth counting. (You will understand this part if you read my review for Hot Mama Noi's Thai on the fly).   I enjoyed my meal, the service was great, lots of parking and prices are affordable. You can't go wrong with Thai Orchid Restaurant.  After reviewing the score cards I think we have a unanimous decision. The winner, by one extra star is, Hot Mama Noi's Thai on the Fly."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to. I adore the food here, definitely my favourite thing about the place. Every dish I have had here has been hands down delicious. My two favourites being Pad Thai & the mango salad. They're both must tries. I have had everything from the spring rolls to noodle dishes. Everything taste good. The prices are fair for the quality & quantity of the food. The service has always been well. Polite & friendly. I had come here for everything from family gathering to dates. I use to live about 10 minutes away, now I live about 40 minutes away & it's still worth the drive. Only negative about the place is they are closed on Sunday's. I would 110% recommend this place. It's worth traveling a bit for!"}
{"text":"We we there because we were really closed by and we saw a Groupon, si we took the risk and it was \"Good\" the Dumpling are amazing and the curry (red curry was my favorite and the massaman curry) excellent food, the service is over the top, friendly and they wanted to treat you so well and make you feel so well, I will recommended this 100%"}
{"text":"Gross. We ordered three entrees and had them delivered by Door Dash. The Pad Thai was the best out of the three, but still mediocre. The stir fry veggie with chicken smelled like a horses stable and had my son spitting it back out on to his plate; he eats anything. Mine was the orange chicken and I promise you it was not chicken. I'm praying we don't all get sick."}
{"text":"Being half Thai on my mother side, I would crave for some good Thai food. Unfortunately some other places were good only for some dishes and for this place, it's truly a gem in a hidden area.   The tom yum is exactly how I would've made it at home. Larb chicken is made just like how my mom would've made it with exception of her adding more lime and chopping the chicken up.   We also ordered fried chicken for the girls and satay which are both good. For myself, a yellow curry with chicken. Delicious and simple.   For dessert, mango with sticky rice. Sadly they won't do sticky rice by itself but it's okay.   Overall I enjoyed their little romantic restaurant. Some place where I would like to relax with the mister on date night....away from the girls. :)"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this place has been on my bucket list for a while.  So when my date said this was their favorite Thai place, it was the perfect opportunity to try it.  The restaurant is in the Strawberry Square shopping center and sits behind Red Rocks.  The restaurant is small and decor is simple.    We arrived and it was dead with only one other table occupied but it quickly filled up.  After looking at the menu, I decided on vegetarian Pad Bai-Krapraw which is similar to Thai dishes I order elsewhere and of course I went with Thai spicy.    My date went with a dinner special, Pra Ram Loungsoung which was your choice of meat in a peanut and chili sauce on a bed of spinach.  My order was perfect with a good mix of veggies, tofu, basil and spice!  The spice level was spot an and cleared out my sinuses..just the way I like it!  The flavor was great as well.  My date's dinner came out wrong but was quickly corrected and after trying it, it was quiet delicious also.    Service was good and they were nice enough to take my date's item off of the bill since it came out late.    I definitely think the place is worth returning to."}
{"text":"Three stars. I had high hope coming here because a bunch of my friends have been dining here. I thought, if they keep coming it must be worth a try? Later I found out that they come here often more as a convenience because they live nearby... Anyway, to break it down, this place is on the expensive side, their portion is also rather small. I don't even think their food is that authentic or super flavorful, which is strange because Thai food is supposed to be pretty heavy on flavor. I do have to give them thumbs up for nice and courteous staffs, this does not come by often at Asian restaurants. They also have a patio like dining area that has glass panels, which I personally prefer because their inside lighting is VERY dark."}
{"text":"This is a very nice Thai restaurant and I would go back again.  Prices were decent, food was good and the service was pleasant and homey.  Its a lot better than the high end Thai places in downtown that aren't very authentic. Good eats!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my family last week.  When we walked in around 6:30 p.m. there was only one other table seated and our party of 5 walked right and in and was seated. Everything began just fine. We ordered our drinks (they were out of the wine we wanted) and we ordered our appetizers. In relatively short order our appetizers arrived and we waited and waited and waited for our server to take our order. Five other tables were seated in this time and three of them had their orders taken before ours. At first, we did not think anything of it, but later, we found out what a huge pain in the you know what this would be.  When the meals started to arrive, the real ordeal began. First, the meals arrived one at a time with unacceptable intervals between. The first of us got our meal and, when it became apparent the other meals were lagging, he started eating. Then the second meal arrived and again there was a delay, so she started eating. The situation grew uncomfortable because in my family everyone eats TOGETHER. The third meal finally arrived, but what that? Two other people remained. Well, 20 minutes!!!! later the other two had not received their meals. At NO time did anyone come over and check on the table and getting the wait staff's attention proved impossible. Finally 20 minutes after everyone else had received their meals and pretty much finished them, the last two in the party received their meals. When they arrived, they were not the meals we ordered because we had asked for the spice to be mild which they assured us they could do. Well in the \"rush\" to get our final two meals to us, they simply forgot our order.   The manager/owner of the business finally (late in the game) stepped over to the table and said \"I will make this right.\" Now, we never once complained and we never asked him to comp our meals, but we took \"I will make this right\" to mean that he would do SOMETHING.   Well the bill finally arrived and guess what? It was the FULL bill! The owner did not make ANYTHING right!   What a shock from such horrible service.  As for the food, it was just all right. Nothing special from a Thai restaurant. Not bad, but not stellar.  I would avoid this place simply for the horrible service and because the manager/owner is clearly more interested in his bottom line than improving his service or encouraging people to return to this place."}
{"text":"Love it here! Pad thai is awesome and my wife loves the red curry. I recommend those two items highly. The owner is a great guy and I guarantee you'll enjoy your evening there."}
{"text":"Food is good. Atmosphere is nice. This place is definitely hidden. I would of never heard of it or went if it wasn't for our living social deal. I got the pad kee Mao and it was flavorful. Husband got the curry. Only complaint I have is that my meal came with several vegetables in it and I only requested onions. They charged me a $1 extra for that. I have no idea why since it was just a substitution and wasn't asking for anything extra. Other than that, it was good."}
{"text":"With my second experience here, I was not disappointed at all. I got the Thom Yum soup again, with the seafood medley. Full of shrimp, calamari, scallops, and mussels. Simply the best I have had at a restaurant outside of Asia. The Pad Kraprow was also incredible - one of the tastiest dishes (Thai or otherwise) that I have ever had. I am so happy that we have this place in Charlotte! Highly recommended!   Note: This, too, was a delivery order from Foodie Call, so I can't speak for the interior or actual dining experience inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - bumping it up to 4 for generous portions...  Hubs grabbed takeout from Thai Orchid after a very long holiday weekend..I was itching for something spicy and noodle-y, thus pad thai seemed to fit the ticket. Price wise, our bill for two noodle dishes and an order of their fresh rolls came to $28. Not too shabby and a bit less than my Thai fave Uptown. Since I can't comment on the staff or the ambiance, I'll get right to the eats...  Fresh Rolls: Light, fresh and tasty spring rolls filled with chicken, carrots, cucumbers, and rice noodles, wrapped in rice paper and served with tangy peanut sauce. The menu said shrimp were in here too, but I didn't see any. Maybe it's an option? Nonetheless, they were large, fully stuffed and a perfect healthy start.   Pad Thai: Typical pad thai with shrimp, chicken, green onion and tons o' noodles. I asked for it spicy (not Thai spicy) and it had pleeeenty of kick. Blowing my nose kick. Kick start my metabolism. Flavor wise it's a nice pad thai - not my favorite in Charlotte, but well made and a generous portion.   If I'm in the SouthPark-ish area and jonesin' for some Thai, I'll definitely try Thai Orchid again!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that I'd not discovered this sooner. I've been here twice so far and both times have not been disappointed. I'd recommend that if you like it spicy, to tell them (I ordered a dish with two peppers beside it and it was not that spicy - we fixed that on the second visit). The thai iced tea was delicious, and the tofu cubes nice and crisp withe the vegetable dishes I ordered. Love this place."}
{"text":"My once in a blue moon craving for mango salad hit and off we went. Got there and the place was quite empty with no other patrons in there. Ordered about 4 dishes and waited anxiously. As we were waiting, my husband and I heard someone clipping their nails. (I'm sorry but isn't that something that should be done in the privacy of your home?). He went up to the counter to find the waitress with her foot up on the counter while sitting on a stool clipping her nails and one of our dishes sitting right next to her to bring to our table. With disgust he expressed how unhygienic it was to be working in a restaurant and giving yourself a pedicure while one the job. She didn't see anything wrong with what she was doing. When we asked for a manager we were told that he had stepped out and wouldn't be back until closing. Needless to say my craving went out the window really quickly."}
{"text":"Thai Orchid is located on Highway 2 in Pickering just West of Valley Farm Road in the plaza with the Running Room and the Greek Place. I came here with my mom on a Saturday evening for dinner.  I'm fairly new to Thai food but have enjoyed most of what I've had so far so we arrived and had a fairly thorough look over the menu. My mom suggested we try the cold thai rolls and mango salad and I was game for both to share. I ended up going with a chicken and eggplant dish and my mom went for classic pad thai.  Now, it took the server FOREVER to come over an even take a drink order. This restaurant isn't that big and it most certainly was NOT busy on a Saturday evening. I think there may have been a whopping 4 tables in the entire restaurant, none bigger than a party of 4 so there's no excuse for service this slow.  My mom ordered a glass of wine and she said something seemed kind of off about it but she drank it and didn't send it back. Our cold rolls came quickly followed by the mango salad. The cold rolls were excellent with a nice spicy sweet dipping sauce. They're quite a bit larger than usual so when ordering keep this in mind if its just two of you sharing. The mango salad was excellent, all the components sliced super thin and lots of crushed peanuts all over. I'm usually not a HUGE fan of mango salad but I could eat this one all day.  My main dish, Siam Style Eggplant, was disappointing at best after two excellent appetizers. It was okay but then the more I ate, the more I realized how very very very salty it was. I couldn't finish it and ended up throwing the leftovers out the next day because all I could smell was the salt off of it. My mom was disappointed with her Pad Thai, said it was good, but the pad thai at the Red House in Pickering was much better.   Overall, Thai Orchid was a decent place to eat, not super cheap but not overly pricey. The portions are generous and some of the dishes are quite good. Service was very slow without any plausbile excuse for why (seeing the two front of house employees standing around behind the bar area frequently when we needed things). I'm not sure I'll come back but I might just to try a few other dishes."}
{"text":"I'm done giving this place my business. Last visit in, I had a great experience and my food turned out delicious. Maybe it was because I was a walk in. Tonight I called my order in and the man on the phone literally told me I couldn't have it the way I wanted. Really? I asked why a month ago they made it for me but wouldn't tonight..he asked if I was sure I had been there before and if I knew where they were located. Yes, thanks. I'm tired of places like this acting so crazy and shocked at something. a little bit different. I eat Thai at least TWICE per week...I order the same thing EVERY SINGLE TIME. I know how and what I like.  Thanks Thai Orchid. I will give my business to someone else, who wants my money & respects me as a customer, no matter the way I want my order.   Thai Taste University, Viet-Thai from now on."}
{"text":"Passable, veg friendly Thai place. Nothing out of this world, or even stand out, but a decent choice if you're looking for curry and live in this 'hood.   Surroundings are a little contrived and stuffy (think fake village chic), but the interior is comfy, warm, and casual. Service was great start to finish, and we saw an owner (older Thai lady) wandering around, greeting her regulars. Tres cool.  Interesting features: hotpots (they have a large variety of soups, all of which feature veg friendly versions) are served somewhat traditionally, in an aluminum pot built around a sterno insert to keep things warm. A large part of the menu is \"pick your meat\" and accessible to veggies via the tofu option, cool cool.   But the flavors are toned down (I blame that on the obscene rent I'm sure these guys are paying) and even though my red curry was decently hot (of course, I ordered extra extra extra spicy and this was far from it) it lacked the deep level of flavor I eat curries to experience. Ah well."}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai place in the area. Very similair to the original Satay on the road on Bayview. Everything tastes good and is well priced. Service is friendly and consistent."}
{"text":"It is a pretty pricy Thai restaurant. But there is not too much competition for them in Charlotte, so you got to go with it. I just like their mee krob."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food Ive had in the States. The Tom Kha soup is on point, the perfect balance of savory and sweet. I had amazing curry and they even had the traditional Thai dessert.... mango and sticky rice! This is the best Thai restaurant in Charlotte. Don't go anywhere else for Thai food!!!!"}
{"text":"Needed to change this review. One of your servers put the wrong plate on another table, came back after a few minutes, took it off and put it on the correct one. Very unsanitary. Not okay. I saw that and left. Not coming back here. Don't even know how many times this has happened."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in the world!  The food, service, and wine menu are great.  Ask for the owner Ed if it is not on the menu he will have the chef make it for you.  Additionally, tell them to bring on the spice they love a challenge.  A must eat place while visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"Thai Orchid is an OK Thai restaurant.  The lunch specials are moderately priced and small enough for you to not want to take a nap right after eating.  I mainly get the Pad Thai when I visit because it's usually the 1 out of 4 dishes I recognize on the menu.  I've had better, but it's decent.   Today I was happy to see that they had Pad Prik King (or Pad Prig King depending on the restaurant) on their lunch menu today so that is what I ordered.  Next to the item it indicated it was of medium heat (spice wise) and I was fine with that because I can tolerate some pretty good heat.  When it came in front of me I was happy to dive in!  My first bite started off with a good flavor....until about 3 seconds later when the heat hit.  Holy moly, it was so hot I almost started to cry right in front of my co-workers!  I thought maybe I picked up a Thai Chili by accident in that bite, so I drank some water and had some plain rice to cool down the fire and tried again....MISTAKE!  I couldn't believe how spicy it was!  I couldn't even eat the spring roll that comes with the lunch because the heat (temperature) from the spring roll was only making it worse!  I asked a co-worker to try it just to make sure for some reason that my tolerance for spice today wasn't lowered, but he couldn't eat it as well!  He can sit in front of me and eat a raw jalapeno seeds and all and not even flitch and he couldn't stomach this dish.    I've ordered the Pad Prik King for dinner once and definitely know that it wasn't nearly as spicy as it was today!  It was actually quite tasty and that was why I was excited to see it as a lunch special.  Usually Thai Orchid is ok, especially for a quick lunch and it's proximity from our office, but I really can't see myself coming back here.  Next time I'll stick with what I know and travel a little further to my favorite Thai restaurant in the Dil'!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch takeout and I really enjoy their mushroom thai soup which was super tasty.  The mango wasn't too bad either.  Just make sure you take out the hot chilli peppers before you accidentally eat them.  They also have lunch specials to check out.  They said that you save 10 percent off your bill for takeout but they didn't take it out on my receipt so that's why I give it a 4/5."}
{"text":"Great place. We've been there three times now. Very tasty thai. Great prices. Good service. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the location is bland."}
{"text":"They do have a few interesting tofu dishes, but overall I thought their food was average. If you have never been in this complex before it is tucked behind the Fresh Market and red rocks cafe. The signage can not be seen from the two parking areas and since you can't see any signs you feel like you might be in the wrong place."}
{"text":"My mom and I eat here every time she comes in town. I have never been disappointed. The food is always flavorful and filling. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Delicious food fast! The food was excellent. We didn't have to wait to sit down, and our fresh food arrived within about 5 minutes from the time we ordered it. Service was excellent. No MSG! They use natural sauces! The tamarind candies they give are delightful!!!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to write a review for this place for the longest time now....  It's a great 'hidden gem' since it is not very visible from the corner of Fairview and Providence.  Definitely my \"go to\" Thai place... everything I have had here has been delicious and the service is great.  I've never tried their take out, but it's probably just as good as eating there minus the relaxed and cozy atmosphere.    Tip:  When mangoes are in season, get the mango and sticky rice dessert!"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Thai food and cook a lot of Asian foods (I'm Asian) so I had very high expectations coming here for lunch. We ordered the lunch specials Pad Thai and Yellow Curry, along with a plate of chicken larb. The food came out hot and fresh and the waitresses were very nice but there was more to be desired with the food.   The larb came to the table warm and had mint leaves that was already turning black. Either the larb was old or the mint leaves used were not fresh. I've made and eaten enough larb to know that mint leaves don't turn black until at least the next day.   There was nothing overly special about the pad thai or yellow curry. Nothing in flavor that screamed \"Wow that was REALLY good.\"   Plus: lunch came with a hot soup and hot crispy spring roll and both were really good!"}
{"text":"After constantly driving by this place we decided to finally pop in and give it a try. The waitress greeted us upon entering and told us to pick our seat. We chose a table along a banquet in the front of the restaurant.   The waitress was doing double duty handling dine in guests and those ordering take out but she did a good job checking on all the customers.  To drink I ordered a green tea which came in a large pot which I always adore. The tea was a mild jasmine flavoured green tea which I enjoyed.  We ordered a few dishes to share between the two of us:  Pad Thai (chicken & shrimp) - stir fried rice noodle wih tofu, egg, and tamrind sauce, topped with fresh bean sprouts, roasted peanuts, spring onions and lime I have had soo many bad takes on pad thai however this place puts the rest to shame. They got it right, perfect balance of hot, sour, salt, and sweet without being too saucy or dry and ample chopped peanuts and fresh veg on top to give it some crunch  Crispy Beef - crunchy beef with sweet peppers, carrots, onions, and thai chilli Good amount of heat in this dish, beef was perfectly cooked and crispy. I really liked all the fresh stir fried peppers mixed into the sweet and spicy sauce.  Peanut Chicken Curry - Chicken breast, pineapple, and roasted peanuts simmered in thick red curry sauce My favourite dish of the night! Probably the best thai curry i've ever had! Sooo flavourful, loved the thick spicy red curry sauce with the addition of juicy sweet pineapple tidbits mixed in to balance it out. Also tons of white meat and roasted peanuts in this dish. Just heavenly!  Sooo happy I finally checked this place out! Really great flavourful thai food with fresh ingredients and good amount of heat and spice. Portions are large, you'll definitely have leftovers for lunch!"}
