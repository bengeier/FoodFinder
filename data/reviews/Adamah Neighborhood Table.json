{"text":"Cute interior -- very clean, super friendly service, and one of the better club sandwiches I've had! I was in a rush and the food came out quickly without sacrificing flavor or presentation -- everything was made to order, even the sliced turkey on my club. The guy working couldn't have been nicer! Would definitely recommend as a lunch spot -- there are a good amount of vegetarian and vegan options as well which I always appreciate."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this little gem as I was out exploring. I'm just visiting for a couple days and was desperate for a quick and healthy lunch with a comfortable environment. Wow, did this place hit the spot. I was welcomed enthusiatically and given an overview of the menu. I ordered the sweet potato hash with a side of fruit. It had the perfect level of seasoning and spice. And my egg on top was cooked exactly over medium like I asked. They also do a wonderful job reducing waste and have clearly marked signage as to which items go into which bin. Excellent service and delicious food. If I'm ever back in town I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I hope this can be constructive. Since reopening for the season with new management some things have been weird. Everything seems messier and dirtier, and the food greasier and/or more sugary. 

I've had sandwich bread toasted to crouton level, extra unnecessary sugar sprinkled on stuff, french toast served with copious amounts of syrup already poured on it (usually the individual eating it gets to do this) some kind of non-dairy queso sauce added where there never was any before. Everything on the menu last year felt fresh and was delicious. I really can't say that is true anymore. I keep going back, wanting to like it, but I don't. 

It seems like there are some odd ideas taking over. The customer service seems a bit awkward and disingenuous, and the person or people working seem a bit high strung when it was really pretty chill last year."}
{"text":"** Here are reviews from a group order I placed at work today ** 

The Persian style veggie soup : vegan, dill-icious. Nowhere else in downtown Madison [the land of cheese and cream] have I been able to find flavorful veggie/vegan soups 
(not including Miso soup, of course) 

Sweet Potato Hash: Literally irresistible. The sweet potato was the perfect consistency, and the flavors were notable yet not overpowering. 

The Herbed Tuna Sandwich : \"great value. lots of food, lots of taste, only $8. This is like a $10 sandwich easy.  Even the pickle was good!\" 

Matzo Ball Soup : \"Reminiscent of my grandmother's kitchen\" 

Bagel & Lox : \"I've never seen smoked salmon of this quality at such a reasonable price point before. The bagel seemed freshly baked, and the cream cheese had garden-fresh flavors\"  

**We're all picky eaters, and even so, we collectively give Adamah a 5 Star Rating!!**"}
{"text":"Food is very tasty and seems healthy. Had great Matzah ball soup and sweet potato hash. Casual setting. Order and pick up at counter but this is not fast food. Much better and wholesome but with a tinge of Israeli influence."}
{"text":"This place surely has its fans, and it would be a shame to lose, because it is a lovely space with nice comfort food options, including some healthful ones. The matzoh balls are authentic and huge. All the portions seem overly generous. The soup the dumpling was in was less flavorful than I would like, the pastrami cured lox was interesting but not tip top quality fish. The real complaint was the hot pastrami, which was the toughest I've experienced I my long deli-eating life. Actually inedible. Maybe it was old? Their Jewish BLT was hard to complain about, who can taste the meat (beef fry instead of bacon) amidst all the mayo, lettuce, and thick toasted bread? Their bread is great by the way, though the bagels are not real (they use the fake, bready ones that many people do prefer for sandwiches).  I would go back without question, but may have to search for the right thing to order."}
{"text":"The smoothies were great! That falafel sandwich though...I'll stick to Banzo. It was beyond dry and took way too long to make since we were the only ones there. Will come back for a smoothie but that's probably it."}
{"text":"Who knew a fun little community cafe could have an eclectic menu with delicious food?

If you are able to visit during one of their few open hours, I'd recommend it. It seems great for a lunch stop, but I will warn you that their portions are rather large. 

I stopped for lunch and ordered the sweet potato hash along with an \"original\" knish (just potato). The food took a very long time (about 30 minutes) to prepare, which was strange because the cafe was empty when I walked in and there were also no orders behind mine. When my order was ready, the knish wasn't in the order. I asked about it, and the man behind the counter apologized, started preparing it. 

The bumps in service were made up for in how excellent the food was. The knish was absolutely delicious! I can't believe I had never tried one before. After eating that, I only managed a few bites of the sweet potato hash, but that was also VERY tasty. 

The menu is very inclusive of vegan and gluten-free items, so everyone should be comfortable finding something on the menu. 

I can't wait to try one of their food specials and grab another knish."}
