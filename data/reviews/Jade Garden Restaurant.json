{"text":"We work right down the road and order food from Jade Garden at least 3 times a week. They are the BEST chinese food!!! Their sushi is AMAZING and I'm really picky about the sushi I like. The delivery guy is so nice and quick!!! Love them!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST SUSHI they also gave me this awful appetizer for free. The waiter is awful at English and there is no lighting in this restaurant. The menu is limited with nothing good on it anywhere. Even the water doesn't taste like water. The sushi is warm and has a strong fishy taste."}
{"text":"This is one of our most frequent go-to Chinese restaurant.  Always reliable.  Good for take-out and eat in.  Pleasant atmosphere inside when busy, but can be kind of lonely at off-hours."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to enjoy some sushi or traditional Chinese. The service is great and the food is excellent. Best in Murrysville."}
{"text":"Good food with fast, courteous service.

This is our go-to place for Chinese in Murrysville.

The only thing we've ever gotten that disappointed were there crab Rangoon's... So we just don't order them here.

All other meals and side dishes are very tasty and good.

Cannot comment on the sushi as we don't get sushi he either.

Pad Thai, Gen Tso, Sesame Shrimp, other meals are all good."}
{"text":"30 years and not a single complaint!

Started visiting Jade Garden back in 1987 when I worked in the area.  The owners (Larry and Wendy) and staff are super friendly.  The service is always top notch.  The food is awesome, flavorful, and always very consistent.  I've probably tried everything on the menu, but HOT SPICY CHICKEN is my favorite, with GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN and MOO SHOO PORK close 2nd and 3rd.  Their sushi is also a very good choice.  I tend to judge a Chinese restaurant by their hot and sour soup.  Jade's is always amazing -- best I've had anywhere -- and I have tried many Chinese restaurants.  I've never had a single reason to complain, never felt a meal was less than perfect, and never walked away hungry or unsatisfied in 30 years!  I'm amazed that anyone could rate Jade less than a \"5 Star\" rating.  If you've never been there, give them a try -- you won't regret it.  If you HAVE been there, you know what I'm talking about -- and regulars won't bother reading reviews anyway... they know a good place when they find it."}
{"text":"The sushi= phenomenal!
Dumplings= wonderful 
Pad Thai= amazing
Fortunes= on point!


Thanks Jaden garden"}
{"text":"The food here is yummy. This is the only place I go for Chinese and sushi. I've tried a lot of things here and my favorites are their sesame chicken and crab salad."}
{"text":"We've always loved Jade Garden, it was always our favorite & recommended to everyone.  Recently we ordered takeout & the crab rangoons were not very fresh tasting and I was not feeling well after.  Today we went for lunch,  we sat for at least 10 minutes & no one came to offer drinks or take our order.  Three employees came from kitchen,  made eye contact with me and went on their merry way--twice!  When I saw an employee fix his own sushi lunch and go back in the kitchen that was my final straw. We left and no one noticed us walking out either.  I won't be back,  if you don't want to service folks,  don't open the doors."}
{"text":"This is old school atmosphere but the god is amazing! King crab sushi roll was fresh and made to order and the pad Thai was very good served steaming hot! Great food!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. It seems like they raise the prices every week, I have tried this place three times and it is very disappointing. The portions you get for what you pay are way out of balance. I know Asian places are cheap, but this is extreme. Latest example? Sesame chicken for $14.63 carry out. I almost finished the entire take out in one sitting. While yes I might be over weight and can eat, this is still ridiculous for Chinese food. Also, if you pay $14.63, do you think you would get ONE napkin or pair of chop sticks? Nope, Asian restaurant cheapness again. With the billions of choices for Asian and Chinese food, try anyone else but them. Even Hunan Garden right up the street in the plaza is better....but not by much."}
{"text":"This place was incredible!! Best garlic sauce I have ever had! The pad tai was amazing and the waiter was very nice! I would highly recommend you eat here! They have reasonable prices, great service, and WONDERFUL food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food....EVER! My husband & I used to live just down the street, so we would go every Friday. Every.Single.Friday. And sometimes, if he worked late or was out of town, I'd sneak in an extra nights worth of delicious Jade Garden!

Kevin is \"our guy.\" He always remembers our meals. We moved to Chicago almost 2 years, and I go to Jade Garden each time I come home. Last month, I walked in with my parents - Kevin immediately recognized me, introduced himself to my parents, and then knew exactly what I wanted - drink, appetizer, and entree - he even remembered that I only eat white meat chicken! This simply amazes me. It's such a rarity to find outstanding customer service, and that is exactly what Kevin provides.  Because of this, he earns a fatter tip, and we even gave him a Christmas card. 

Go see Kevin at Jade Garden, and you won't be sorry. 

I have yet to find a comparable Chinese restaurant in Chicago, which is saying something since there are probably 100 times more of them here!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was excellent when your looking for good Chinese food this place is definitely a diamond in the rough.    I will be back often 

I have been back quite often changing it up to try the various foods never disappointed.   Just had the Thai Pad got mine spicy WOW!!! The flavors    A slice of Heaven less then a half a mile from me"}
{"text":"I guess I have stopped into Jade Garden a total of 4 times. I do feel you get a better experience eating in here and getting Chinese. Now, I want to come clean...I have a thing for sushi. Lets call it a weakness and I feel the need to try it everywhere. This time I did do a pickup order of sushi. I went with the 3 sushi roll dish they have. My first experience with sushi here was so-so. I felt the need to try it again.  All I'm saying is the portion was very good for the price but I would honestly recommend some of the other items they have. I'm a true believer that if you eat sushi you need to go ALL the way. Go all in and go with the high quality expensive place. Yes I might give in and try it again but that's because I have issues. ;)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  I have eaten takeout from Jaden's several times in years past but this was my first dine in experience.  A few negatives right off the bat.  The parking lot is big, but really needs paved.  I felt like an earthquake had traveled below it.  Nitpicky, maybe, but still.  The interior of the place is pretty dated, and I thought it was in need of a good scrubbing.  There was dried food on the table cloth.  I let it go, but kind of unappetizing.

They have a few sushi, maki, and sashimi specials on their lunch menu.  I was a bit too hesitant to try, so I opted for shrimp low mien.   I asked for it to be prepared spicy, and it was not at all prepared spicy.  It came with soup and a beef egg roll.  I opted for Hot and Sour soup.  It was pretty standard.  Our lunches came out and they were very big portions for lunch, though the price was about $9.00 so I think the size matched the cost.  You should definitely have leftovers.  My dish, as stated lacked any heat, but I let it go.  It was okay, I fear that they didn't clean their shrimp properly.  I hope it was only the one piece that I found, as I don't need to get sick off the poop.  

I didn't try the beef egg roll.  One it was fried, so not trying to do that anymore, and two a beef egg roll doesn't really sound appealing.  This was seconded by my friend who did eat his and said it wasn't very good.  Overall there are other Chinese/Sushi/Thai places local to work, that I'd prefer to go, so it would be unlikely to keep this in my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place. It was yummy! Family owned business and great service. It was very authentic and fresh food. I really love the general tso shrimp (which is rare to find) and the shrimp dumplings."}
{"text":"Some of the best delivered sushi I have ever had. A little bit on the expensive side, only by a few dollars though. Their spider roll is to die for. I recommend any sushi and any dish overall. Very good service."}
{"text":"As a devotee of Hunan Kitchen when I'm in Murrysville, I hadn't really experienced much of Jade Garden's ways.  So when a Murrysville-local friend decided that we were going there, I was up for something new, but still wondering a bit why we weren't just going to Hunan Kitchen.  They're the best around, after all!

Well, let me say, my allegiance is still with the HK, but if Jade Garden were a Facebook page, I'd click \"like\" for it.

The d√©cor inside is way cooler than most of the Chinese restaurant interiors I've seen... I mean, most places you go, you'd swear they all just mail-order a Chinese restaurant from a catalog and ship the exact same interior to every single place.  Not so with Jade Garden.

Their crab rangoons are shaped differently from what you are used to.  And they taste godly.  Like, really good.  Good enough that I just spaced out for a bit thinking about them instead of continuing this review.

Our waiter was really nice, too! He wasn't your typical \"I'd probably be just fine but we can't really communicate because of the language barrier so let's just do business and be done with it,\" Chinese restaurant waiter, he was engaging and just generally a cool dude.  I don't mind the typical Chinese restaurant experience, but this guy was definitely a bonus.

I'd like to say I'll return here, but I probably won't.  I don't do a lot in Murrysville, and I won't be in the area much longer.  But if I WERE to be around, I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Delivery person was great.  Hot n Sour Soup sucked and had s horrible aftertaste if I don't know what.  The PuPu platter: Rangoons and wings were good but the ribs, egg roll, spring roll were all nasty.  Shrimp Fried Rice was bland.  Never again."}
{"text":"Very cool decor inside the restaurant. I visited looking for a chineese buffet in Murrysville  Lunch menu price does not match actual description as you must choose between soup or egg roll and on the menu it list soup and an Eggroll, so there is a $2.50 up charge to add eggroll, and lunch ended up costing $12.50 instead of $8.50, as was expected best on menu price. Other than this, the food is very good, adequately portioned, authentic, traditional Chinese, and the hospitality was good and posotive - dispite broken eglish - with a definite family owned and operated feel.  I ordered the Happy Family (which is equivalent to the Triple Delite) and it came out very expediently and did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant hands down. The atmosphere is pleasant, I am always met with a warm reception, it is family friendly, and the food is simply amazing! I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is mood for Chinese. I know that I am in the area I always find to stop there for some greats eats!"}
{"text":"Peaceful interior. Reminiscent of the Chinese restaurants of the past. Soothing Chinese music. Kind staff. Good crunchy noodles! Good wonton soup with lots of scallions. Happy Family very tasty. Excellent fried rice. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It was honesty really gross.
1. The Pad Thai had zero flavor. Like, nothing. I get that Thai is not the focus of this place, but I've made better at home, and if you can't do it justice, don't put it on the menu. I couldn't eat it. 
2. The General Tsos, which I figured was super safe, was dried out and overcooked.
3. The sweet and sour chicken wasn't bad, but the veggies were weirdly bitter. Like, inedible. 

Everything was cold. I was appreciative at first that they were reusing Girl Scout boxes (so sturdy! way to cut down on packaging!) but I think that contributed to the heat loss. 

Will not return:("}
{"text":"I stopped by to have some Mitzo Soup No Flavor 
I tried the Tuna Sushi and it was barely chilled plated poorly and looked like gobs laying on my plate.The sauce was good the Ginger was dry.But my iced tea was great!The waitress went back to the kitchen and every time the door opened I could see her on her phone sitting on something.She never came back to refill my drink or to give me a bill.So I went to cashier and they were eating.Maybe I stopped at a bad time of day .It was 2:30 on a Wednesday afternoon."}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant! Spotted it by the road a decided to give it try, so glad we did. We had crab Rangoon that had actual crab in them, delicious.  We had miso and wonton soup both great. I had shrimp and veggies in a white sauce. Both were perfectly cooked, a rarity in Chinese restaurants. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Before you read this, you should know I am honestly not a customer, I am a Middle Eastern server worked there for one month and a half, and my relationship with the owners Larry and his wife Wendy were good, but I quit from my own, once I found out why no servers working there. So I think my review will be useful for you more than anybody else, it's a review that was born inside the deep kitchen of that Resturant 

Why am I writing this? 

I write this not because I do not want you to go there, but to let you know what is going on behind the kitchen door in the process of preparing your food. 

Now let's begin, that Resturant is an old Resturant, some dwellers beside the house I lived in there, told me that Jade Garden was excellent in the past, but now no more, you should know now that your food is prepared by a sick old miserable chef called Jack is almost 72 years old, he is actually sick and he swallows his pride when the owner insult him and yelling at his face in the busiest time, cause he is old and no place to go, the old sick chef is suffering from Asthma, that causes him chronic flue, and in the busy time he sweating too much and the steam of cooking makes him worst, I saw him always spits from his nose by his own bare hands into the trash can, and still cooking . And because he is the only chef there I never eat from his hands, only his assistant can cook fried rice in front of my eyes for me, for me to eat. 

I guarantee and on my own responsibility that the chef is called Jack and he is so sick suffering asthma and I think he has a problem in his memory as well because he forgets many times. 

The old owner Larry has a good family and a beautiful cute grandson, but he is also sick and so stingy, no body work as a sushi chef, he does not want to pay extra so he hired his wife to go so, and when I quit he refuse to pay me my two weeks working basic money, full-time day and night, and he pushes his wife Wendy to force me to work until the end of the month, but I refused, she said it's your choice, if you quit now, then no money, nobody else work instead of you, I told her I can not work anymore here, the chef is not jerked but I pity him, he forgets too much and super nasty by his dirty appearance and spitting on trash can. 

PS : if you get inside, to make sure of that or to report about this scandal, then sit inside, then pretend you have mistaken your way to the bathroom then open the kitchen door to see the old sick chef Jack, you will find the rear kitchen door in the middle walkway between ladies room and men's room. 

If you go there too eat sushi, then it's fine, but the only thing I recommend do not eat any roll has crab inside, the crabmeat there is a super fake Chinese product. Also, you have to expect a good delay, the owner wife is also old and so slow as well, apparently you will not find young servers like every where, if you find your server is an old lady, then that is the owner's wife sister, so please repeat your sushi order twice so she can understand and give you the right order. 

Why did not I file a complaint? 

I am not from Pennsylvania, I work during my academy vacation, so when they refuse to pay me my days JUST BECAUSE I stop the owner Old Larry from yelling for no reason. 

Notes: this review also will be posted in many locations online also the Social media, I am bigger than using a person for $ 300, but now I have time to file a complaint against the business, and to report the health department to check my story about that sick old chef who is being humiliated constantly now I have the time to file a complaint against the business, later, I have made some contacts with a specific newspaper and they are excited to know which Resturant I am talking about, but I have to give that owner last chance to solve every thing, give me my money, solve the chef problem and we are good. 
 Thanks for your understanding."}
{"text":"The best. My boyfriend and I go here all the time. You cant get better sushi anywhere else. I can't find other Chinese food I like more."}
{"text":"Jade Garden does it again! 
Ordered delivery for dinner on Thursday night. This was the first time I was able to order online using the Beyond Menu App. (By the way, I highly recommend getting this App as well). The food was wonderful, as usual. We got plenty to feed our large family and still had enough for lunch on Friday, which is always a bonus!

We ordered General Tso chicken, chicken fried rice, they also gave us white rice, chicken lo mein, and chicken egg rolls. I put in the comment section to please add fried wontons and duck sauce. Which they sent us a lot of.

I also ask them to please not put soy sauce, as we never use it. I should've also put no mustard because they sent a lot of that as well. Sadly, we don't use that either. Next time I will remember to tell them not to send that either. 

The only disappointment we had with this order is that they didn't send any fortune cookies. My kids really enjoy the fun of fortune cookies, so we were sad there wasn't any. Next time I will specify for them to send them. 
However, this time they did send forks, plates, and napkins, which was awesome, a huge plus. No dirty dishes!!!

Once again everything was awesome. We are very satisfied customers. Thank you Jade Garden for another superb meal."}
{"text":"We have driven past Jade Garden many times but decided to stop in last night and give it a try for dinner. We were extremely happy with the entire experience. Nothing fancy inside, just basic, well laid out seating areas that were clean and comfortable. 
The service was excellent, very friendly and attentive enough to make sure we had what we needed without being overbearing. 
They served fried wontons with dipping sauces on the table upon our arrival and we had our drinks and placed our orders without delay. The food was extremely fresh and cooked perfectly with no signs whatsoever of being prepared in advance and sitting as we have experienced with other Chinese restaurants. My wife's Kung Pao beef had great flavor and the beef was tender and not chewy or fatty at all. I had sweet and sour pork which was perfectly cooked with fresh vegetables and pork and the sauce on the side. We both had the fried rice which was excellent and would be a meal by itself with tons of flavor and once again appeared to be freshly prepared for our meal. 
This is our new favorite Chinese food go to restaurant and we will return to try more items and the sushi in the future."}
