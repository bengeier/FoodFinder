{"text":"7 guys to one girl every single night - the fat, short and sweaty kind of guys. Disgusting interior with surprise vomit puddles and sharp nails. Bathroom where somebody inexplicably always takes a dump on the floor. Unskilled bartenders who can't mix basic cocktails, and can't be bothered to try. Bloke charges 30 dollars cover for a close approximation of hell, 4 nights a week. Bravo!  Everleigh, Cake and Uniun are all better options."}
{"text":"This club gets crowded pretty fast and there's no room to dance. Shots are $8, which can be expensive. Most of the staff members are pretty nice except when my friends and I went to take a shot at the bar closer to the washroom, the bartender only gave us one lime for 3 people. I asked why she won't give us 2 more and she told us that if we won't tip her, she's not going to give it to us. The other bartender who served us before had no problem giving us lime, we didn't even have to ask, and I tipped her AFTER I took the shot. The music is okay. Mostly new & old popular hip hop / pop songs. It's hard to enjoy unless you're super drunk."}
{"text":"First visit. Dusty bouncer. One of my male friends was denied entry because the bouncer told him he was wearing sneakers, even though our other female friend was also wearing similar looking sneakers. When we pointed this out to the bouncer, he only shrugged and said, \"Well, she got in.\" The bouncer told my male friend he would have to pay about $20 more to get in. But after returning from the ATM to get said money, the bouncer told my friend the price had raised. Definitely wasn't fair for my friend to pay so much more, so our group of friends left. Very disappointing!! We contacted the manager about this and were given free entries for our next visit."}
{"text":"Bloke has been the go-to spot for my friends and I for a while. Cover is usually $15-20 but depends on the bouncers/attendants who sometimes let you in for cheaper or free.   The music is really good if you're into hip hop and some too 40. The crowd is average .. typical of most clubs. Last time I was here this really drunk guy tried to start a fight with me and actually pushed me. The bouncer saw but didn't do anything. Good thing my friends were there to help me."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Good tunes, gets pretty packed, nice venue. Staff are pretty good, they never stop on a busy night. Cover is $20, coat check is $3. Bathrooms are nice, kept as clean as you can on a busy weekend. Lots of booths for bottle service. It's a really stylin' club.  it's got a pretty good vibe most of the time. Wasn't a fan of people vaping, but that's just me. Will probably be back again!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome fun. I went on a Wednesday and they were playing \"Waybacks\" which means 90's. And I love 90's. Great mix of guys and girls. I came with someone so I wasn't trying to meet anyone, though I'm not a good picker upper of girls or anything. But of course, as it always happens, you start dancing with your date and other people join the fun. Some areas of the dance floor are crowded but it's a huge place so there's empty spots too. The drinks are annoying to try to buy. And I saw a fight, which was broken up by security, but was still exciting to watch, Not sure if that's a plus or a negative for you guys, haha. Anyways, good times at Bloke."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience, friendly staff, music is good&layout is amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this place is going into the death spiral. There is a demolition clause on the building so there is no incentive for the owners to make it any better than it is.     So they will keep running parties for 19yr olds and taking their cash till the business is forced to close."}
{"text":"I'll start this off by saying I'm not much of a nightclub person.   Bloke I found to be a decent club, with friendly staff (by nightclub standards) and good music. I went during their Rich Fridays where they have music live to air on Z 103.5. They were efficient at getting people inside, cover was reasonable ($15) drinks not a complete rip off at about $7 a bottle. Only the big brands are here, Bud, Bud Light, Corona & Stella. A huge plus for me is while it was busy there was still some room to be able to move freely compared to other clubs that would let the venue fill up completely. I'd definitely go to Bloke again if there was an event there I was interested in."}
{"text":"What a weird place... I have been to many clubs but never seen one so empty inside with a long line of guys waiting outside. Music is just OK.  Mostly younger crowd, drink are crazy expensive. If you are over 21 and looking for a classy night out with the girls this is not the place for it."}
{"text":"This club was absolutely awful. It started getting empty around 1:30am because the music was terrible. The club was pretty empty when we first got there which was pretty surprising. We expected a larger crowd by around 12:30am but that didn't happen.  One of my friends requested that the DJ play different music as he was playing trap the whole night. Even after she asked him to change the music 4 or 5 times, he didn't do so.  If you're looking for a fun night out with friends, this is definitely not the club to go to!!"}
