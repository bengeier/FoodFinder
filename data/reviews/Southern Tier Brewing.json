{"text":"I heard they opened up and I was excited I got to check it out while I was in Pittsburgh for work.  Southern tier is one of my favorites and they did not disappoint.  Place was packed on a Thursday night and I got a sampler and was happy with all and the service was great.  My burger was better than expected and prices are fair..Good location as well"}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way out of town. Already decided the next time I am in Pittsburgh I have to stop here again. Overall a great place. Beers were very good. If you stop in while 3 citrus peel is available get it. So delicious. Had the pulled pork sandwich with house made chips, quite tasty. Place is new, clean and modern. Good for families. Super busy on game days. Stopped in before a pirates game the first time and it was standing room only but tasted a beer and knew I had to come back and try more plus their food. Happy I did. A must visit when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The little boy manager at this place is a joke. I gave my phone to a bartender to charge bc it was dead after the Steelers game, went back to get it and they said they didn't have it.  I was chill at first but eventually I got rightfully mad and they kicked me out. I was talking to a girl and stayed behind when my friends left so I had no way of getting home. Ended up walking around asking people to give me a ride home for $20 and eventually some dude was nice enough to do so.  Do the find my iPhone thing this morning and GUESS WHERE IT WAS??! That's right folks, at this shit hole. The little boy manager who grasps on to the minuscule amount of power this world provides his miserable existence berated me for 30 minutes and kicked me out making me go through all this crazy shit for no reason. Do not go to this place, please...for me."}
{"text":"So good! Delicious beer, delicious food, kids menu, delightful service. They even labeled our leftovers so they don't get lost in the fridge. We made a meal of appetizers and my least favorite was the super yummy corn dip. My fav by far was the cauliflower. Everyone loved the food."}
{"text":"Gave only one star because this brewery makes my favorite beers but they only had fruity beers and IPA's, which we hate. There was not one beer we wanted to try. Nothing like waiting in line to sit and then leaving without trying anything. Very disappointed. We came from Columbus Ohio because the online tap list showed beers we would like to drink."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, and service is pretty good as well. My husband and I both loved the spicy shrimp dish (Can't recall the actual name). The loaded fries were nothing special. We both enjoyed our tangier beer just wish they had the 3 citrus peel out available to taste."}
{"text":"Sadly this new location in Pittsburgh doesn't live up to the high standards set by the home location in Lakewood, NY.  While the beer is plentiful and the menu is large enough, once inside, the venue feels the same as all of the other faceless restaurants on the North Shore and the food leaves something to be desired.   While the location is obviously different than the original location -- there is no outdoor picnic area, stage, or open air to enjoy -- the food is not the same as the menu in New York (which is exceptional and never disappoints).  Our meals were all overpriced, lacking in any flavor, and all served room temperature to cold (although we all ordered hot meals).   While this may still be a fine place to grab a quick brew before a game or after work, it's hard to feel compelled to go visit again, especially with such lackluster food."}
{"text":"Finally, Southern Tier opened their doors to the public, and what a delightful experience it was. As expected, Southern Tier is beautifully laid out and aesthetically pleasing to the eyes.   You walk into the building from the side and notice the tall brew kettles. This area is also the gift shop for Southern Tier. They have an awesome assortment of glasses, mugs, shirts, and growlers.   We visited right around lunch on a Saturday and it was certainly crowded. We waited 40 minutes for a table but this wasn't unexpected. When we were seated, they had an awesome selection of beer to choose from and they offer flights as well. The food menu was terrific. We had the pretzel bites, nachos, Southern Tier burger, Turkey club sandwich, and smoked wings. The person who ate the wings said they were the best wings he has ever eaten. The Southern Tier burger was also very delicious.   And, I should mention that our server Phil was really great and made it a pleasant experience.  Overall, we were very pleased and I thought they had great beer, great food, and it was all affordably priced. I highly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"I never really got the opportunity to see how southern teir is. I put my name in after the Pirates home opener which I understand is a crazy day.  I was told my wait would be 1.5 hours. I never got a table....  I would like to tell everyone I had a great experience, but I never got a chance. It's been 6 hours and I still haven't gotten a text that my table is ready."}
{"text":"Wonderful wait staff, a special shout out to Jacqueline who was extremely helpful in providing us information on the beer selection as the list is quite broad.  The Shrimp and the cauliflower appetizers were worthy of a 5 star restaurant.  The smoked wings were outstanding.  While the menu is not extensive the meals were well prepared and it is obvious that the philosophy is to do a little very well.  The venue is well appointed and the rest rooms were very clean, especially in light of the crowd.  Will certainly look to return."}
{"text":"This place is going to be busy for quite some time. We arrived a half hour after they opened on a Saturday and it was already packed, so just expect it. I prefer the original location over this new one. The brewery here is huge and there is a lot of space-it's just really loud! The beer selection at this location is great! Lots to choose from-more so than the original location. I ordered a flight and really enjoyed the coffee pumking. The food menu was kind of lackluster for me. I ordered the pretzel bites and felt they were over priced at $7 for just some frozen pretzel bites that were just heated up. They will do well here, especially considering their location."}
{"text":"Great beer...incompetent hosts. Gave the host my name and number 3 times as well as asked her to repeat it back to me since the method of contact was text...waited an hour, went back up to the front only to find out that the host put in my number wrong and texted the wrong number and told me we had to wait another 45 mins for a table. I would recommend writing down your number or possibly asking the host if you can put your own number in so this does not happen to you. But like I said great beer, you can't blame the establishment for hosts that cannot put a phone number in the system, something my 2 year old niece could do without a problem."}
{"text":"The beer was as fantastic as I expected. But the surprise was the food. A small menu - but all delicious!! The pulled pork alone was worth a revisit!! The smoky wings were out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not ready for large crowds, which would be important considering its location. Upon entering, the bar area and tables were packed. Luckily, we had friends that were already at a table and waiting for us. We were told that the kitchen was closing at 11:30pm and we promptly ordered food which came out quickly considering they were at capacity. At 11:50pm, we were told that it was last call and ordered another round. Because of the crowds, our waitress was not able to return to our table with our beers until 12:00am, which is closing time. The lights were flickering and we were told to get out. After only being able to take a sip of the beer that was just paid for, security was working to push our group out the door. Security also insulted us on the way out as we questioned their policy of serving drinks at the last possible second without giving patrons the chance to enjoy. With this experience, it seems to me that they are more interested in getting your money than customer satisfaction. I would not recommend this place to anyone, Southern Tier beer could be better enjoyed elsewhere."}
{"text":"Convenient location when staying at Downtown Pittsburgh. If you are not a beer lover, they have a wide range of beers from fruity to hoppy. Great beer and friendly staff.  Coffee lovers must try \" cold pressed pumking\" and \" 2x expresso\""}
{"text":"Amazing beers, good food an attentive staff and lots of space. Sounds like a win to me!"}
{"text":"Beer is amazing. Service is good theres a bartender named i think zack who allways remembers the beer i like. The foods good and the place is allways friendly and fun. Great place to pregame before a show or game. Better than any bar around here on the north shore"}
{"text":"Just opened to the public today and yet the service, food, and hospitality was in full swing!  Such an incredible staff who really seem happy to be there.  I had the Open Face Meatloaf and it was incredible.  Service was fast and the place was pretty crowded.  The beer is top-notch and sure to find a style for everyone.  I can only imagine what the outdoor section will do for this place when they get it all set.    A coworker had the shrimp appetizer and the burger and was thrilled also.  Family friendly and nice selection of TV's all over the place.  They did everything right.  Good to have you in the neighborhood STBC!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here before the Kenny Chesney concert. We knew it was going to be busy, and it was, so that didn't bother us. We love craft beer and don't mind paying a little extra for good beer. I was really disappointed in the pours though. I was sitting at the bar and I watched every bartender fill up the cups 3/4 full for the beers and for the mixed drinks it was even worse. If I am paying that much for a good beer I expect the bartender to know how to pour it. Otherwise everything was great."}
{"text":"The food here is above the average bar food and the beer is great! The location is nice for game days and the space is really set up well to go there to watch games or have a nice lunch or dinner with some good beer"}
{"text":"Flights are a great deal to sample their brews! 5 six ounce samples for $12.50. Not  big menu but my Reuben with fresh cut fries was great. Salads and a couple dinner plates available. My friend had their double burger which he said was very good. Their home made potato chips have a sweat flavor do I would pass on those."}
{"text":"I am now convinced that the \"Southern Tier Burger\" is the one of the best burgers I have ever had."}
{"text":"Loved Southern Tier. Had the pretzel nibbles for an appetizer, the dipping sauce that came with it was good, but don't use too much.. it can get spicy! I had the BBQ burger, it was delicious! Our waitress was very attentive  even when it got busy. Oh and the beer was all delicious as well. We had a sampler and a few pints before enjoying a concert down the street. Also they sale 6 packs to go!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a beer after a game. Decent selection and great service. A little on the dark side near the bar but only a problem when trying to read receipt."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Master brewer Justin came over and talked to us about the brewery. Not to noisy, was able to have a conversation without raising voice. Many beers to choose from, may try samples. Would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Try the fun flights...pair with the wings and garlic almonds...attentive bar tenders...great location"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. Took over 10 mins (12 to be exact because I did start timing it) before our waitress came to our table. They were steady but not slammed by any means. We ordered drinks. We were there for 20 mins total and half way through our meals before we even got our first drinks. Pretty sure they just pre-make some of the food, club sandwiches specifically, and put them in the fridge because our food came out in 5 mins and the bread was legit cold, but had been toasted at some point. The outdoor space is nice, so that's what balances out the service for 3 stars."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Pittsburgh this weekend from the NYC area and had been looking forward to going to Southern Tier for weeks now. When my friends and I arrived this afternoon, we were told there was a three and a half hour wait to get into a bar area that was about half full. Next, a waiter came up to us to ask if we wanted to have a beer in the gift store (sounds fun), but we left shortly after. 30 minutes after we had left, we got a text saying that there was suddenly space available in the bar for us. Apparently the 3.5 hour wait had magically disappeared!  Quite disappointed considering how much we had been looking forward to this."}
{"text":"I like Southern Tier beer which was what brought me here. The food was actually really good. We had a fried cauliflower app which was so delicious. Wife had the fish and chips sandwich which she said was good. I had the open faced meatloaf which was delicious as well. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We love ST beers...their 2x Christmas Ale and Pumpkin Ale are stellar.  I had the Coffee Blonde and liked it a lot. The lemon drop didn't have much lemon---very subtle.  Pretty good food.  Nice indoor/outdoor place before and after a game.  The pulled pork sandwich was good and so was the quest fundido.  Service was good even for it being super busy the day we were there!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and really like the atmosphere, beer and food. There are a limited number of tables so if you are eating dinner there is usually a wait. When it is crowded the bar is t always the best place to stand either. You are able to try a variety of beers by ordering a flight. There are usually a couple of additional non-Southern Tier brand beers on tap as well. I personally like the raspberry white Southern Tier beer and usually order that to drink. As of March 2017 the outdoor patio is still yet to be built but I think it will be a great addition once completed. The first time I went our waiter was great but other times have been so-so. There is also beer for sale in refrigerators in the front which is nice for taking something home with you."}
{"text":"We have been waiting and waiting for this place to open and the North Shore is the prefect location.  Our friends gathered a group last Saturday afternoon and at 3pm it was a 3 hour wait! It seemed like the crew waited less than 2 hours and it was a very large party. I was suprised by the size once we got in and thought this place would be much bigger. It was so busy they were even limiting those who could come in and hang out at the bar.  Once the group got settled we order our first round of beers. Many got the samplers which I recommend. I went with the raspberry wheat which was a pinkish color and tasted very watered down.   A bit disappointing but they have so many other beers to choose from including Victory which they now own. The menu has a lot of options including many sandwiches. We were just drinking and decided to get a cheesy corn dip served with chips as an appetizer. It was delicious but a very small portion for $9. Our waiter was amazing and handeled our large group like a champ. We will be sure to visit this place again!"}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because I wasn't there long enough to enjoy the place fully. I know I'll be back, though. I thoroughly enjoy Southern Tier beer, and was elated when I heard ST was coming to the 'burgh. The joint is clean, snazzy and posh. My friend and I got a seat, right at the bar in front of the numerous taps. It was so wonderful to have ST brews that I've only ever had bottled straight from the tap. The flight price was AMAZING! Many places are starting to charge a per beer price for flights, but not ST. $12.50 for 5. Perfect! We didn't get to try any cocktails, but since the spirits are ST produced (no idea they had a distillery), I'll probably have one the next time I go, which will definitely be soon."}
{"text":"Came in at the end of the lunch rush so no problem getting a table. Our server was on point with the recommendations and the beer was amazing! Try the meatloaf sandwich it's on top of grilled cheese!!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere..stunning beer selection...horrible service. There's nothing like sitting at a bar and being ignored and rushed out the door. ...sat down at the bar at 9:05. Got a beer. From 9:15 to 9:25 there wasn't anyone  behind the bar.... 4 customers at the the bar. 9:30..2 employees behind the bar desperately cleaning... not interested in serving more beer nor even looking at the customers. 9.35....finally got up and interrupted the conversing bartenders to ask for another beer ... I guess,,,, drinking beer that is overwhelmed by the putrid smell of soap in a mop and bucket,.,,, almost finished with second beer,,, would like another ....excuse me may I  ,,,, oh here's your check ... but I was going to.... never mind 9:55  No tip.  4 beers 25 dolars"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Southern Tier and it did not disappoint. They have plenty of different beers on draft, the bartenders were friendly and the service was great.  To drink, I ordered my usual fall beer, Pumking, and it was delicious as usual. To eat, I ordered the North Shore Club sandwich which was pretty good. I also ordered a mini beer of the Salted Caramel Stout which was also very tasty. Overall, the service was great and I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoyed Southern Tier Brewing one evening! It was a nice night and we were able to sit outside under their covered patio. We most were looking forward to having a beer, but unfortunately a lot of the beers (I would say 4 or 5) we're out. I enjoy trying blonde ales and I had the 8 Days A Week. I really enjoyed this one! It had the perfect amount of hops and fruitiness for me! Next we shared some appetizers. There was a featured menu, so we had the Queso Fundido, which was chorizo mixed in their beer cheese, and their pretzel bites, which is now just one pretzel. For my meal, I had the Southern Tier burger. It was a well seasoned burger, topped with arugula, bacon, an onion ring and garlic aioli. I had the choice of French fries, chips or the macaroni salad. I chose the macaroni salad - and that was delicious!!! I definitely would love to come back and sit at their outdoor bar during the summer!"}
{"text":"Definitely an awesome place to check out for lunch or dinner. Knowledgeable staff and delicious beer. I purchased a crowler of the Blueberry Tart and took it back to my hotel. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time on a busy Saturday afternoon.  When we first arrived we were greeted by a not so friendly hostess who said she hoped we didn't plan on getting a table because they were at capacity.  We inquired about a wait list and was told it would be 2.5 hours.  We put our names on the list and ended up getting a table in little over an hour.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  She pushed the sidecar of creme brulee with our bread pudding and it was absolutely perfect.  Got a reasonably priced flight and some other beers and will definitely be back.  Had its flaws (systems went down, servers were confused at times) but thats to be expected!  The place looks great!"}
{"text":"came here with my husband for a late lunch, the wait was much quicker than we had anticipated. they take your phone number and text you when the table is ready. they told us 15 minutes but it was really more like 5 minutes.   while milling around the gift shop waiting for our table, a worker came up to us and asked if we'd like to order some beer. thinking that the wait was going to take longer than anticipated, we obliged.   the cold press coffee pumking is game changing. the normal pumking is too much \"spice\" for me, but this cold press coffee version is much tastier.   I got the Reuben and my husband got the fish and chip sandwich. Both of us got the house made chips, which had just enough BBQ seasoning on them for you realize they were BBQ; this was good since BBQ sauce and Reuben doesn't exactly scream appetizing to me - in this case it was pretty tasty.   Downside was that it was pretty busy when we came and we waited at our table for 15 minutes before I decided to get up and tell the hostess that no one had attended or acknowledged us. sounded like our table had been pushed with another table in the previous seating and then no one knew who it was assigned to now. Another thing I would consider a downside is that they jam you up pretty good if you're sitting at a table instead of a booth. The tables are all pretty much on top of each other."}
{"text":"Finally, another good family friendly pregame option besides Burgatory.  Surprisingly good service for game day and great food! The smoked wings were fantastic- a great change from the norm. My husband liked his beer and it was reasonably priced. The kids both had the kids quesadilla with chips instead of fries. Their meals were good as I sampled them. Husband also enjoyed his pulled pork. Server was attentive and frequently checked in with us. Great experience- will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The Pittsburgh location had big shoes to fill but they nailed it! The brewery is open with tons of seating and great views of the fermenters. The vibe is very similar to the brewery in Lakewood, NY. This location has a patio in progress so I can't wait to come back on game day and grab a beer outside. They have all of their beers on tap plus Pittsburgh-specific brews and guest brews. There are pre-determined flights or create-your-own, both are great values. The beer is fantastic, no surprise. I really enjoyed the Pittsburgh Blonde and Golden Ales. I was disappointed they were already out of the Raspberry Wheat so I guess I will have to wait until next summer! The Pittsburgh location has a better menu than the Lakewood brewery, likely because they built a full kitchen at this location. Everyone was pleased with the portion and taste of their meal. I ordered their namesake burger with garlic aioli, maple bacon, and beer cheese in-between the patties - it was incredible. My family enjoyed the BBQ sandwich, club sandwich, and wings. The beer is incredible, prices are reasonable, food is delicious, and the service is fantastic. Welcome to Pittsburgh, Southern Tier!"}
{"text":"We had a great time here! We just went out for drinks with friends and had a wonderful time. They have a great selection of beers. The thick mint tastes just like a thin mint and a few in our party had the cold press pumpking and really enjoyed it! We'll be back soon to try more of their beers."}
{"text":"If you're not a beer lover, wait a few weeks to check this place out. No liquor license yet, no soft drinks served. Choices are beer or water. No indication of this on the website or yelp. This is why I'm giving them 3 stars.   Service was really great - above expectations. Kyle was amazing. Food was great and my beer loving husband was in beer heaven.   Atmosphere is so cool with bottles and merchandise for purchase near entry. We will definitely be back again, but only after calling to ask if they are serving other drinks like the Moscow mule pictured on their website."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend coming here on a Friday night, especially if you'd like a table. The space is deceivingly small; it looks a lot bigger than it actually is. My friends and I came here on a Friday night and we were told the wait was 3 hours and 20 minutes. Yes, over three hours! We waited it out and it probably ended up only being an hour. Goes to show the quoted wait time isn't always accurate! I came here again for a work Christmas lunch and couldn't have been happier with my experience. My team ordered just about every appetizer on the menu and everything was delicious. In addition, the service was great even with our very large group.   If you're coming here, I recommend going during off-hours. I'm not sure if they take call-aheads or reservations, but if they do, that's the way to go for a table. Once you can sit down, the food and beer will be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Fabulous microbrewery!  Our server, John, was super attentive, friendly, and efficient!  The food was good -- the beer selection fantastic!"}
{"text":"I had the privilege of having a later dinner here in early December.  A friend and I met up for a few beers and a sandwich.  We were promptly seated and greeted upon walking in.    I opted for a pint of Old Man Winter which was excellent.  I also had a BBQ burger with chips.  The chips were pretty good.  I enjoyed the burger as well.  It wasn't the best burger ever but was full of flavor.  Waitress was very attentive.  Overall I really enjoyed my visit to Southern Tier and would go back.  Great location, good service, and decent food.  Definitely worth a look!"}
{"text":"When I walked in there were a few workers in the front area.  None even acknowledged me.  There were a ton of kids running around the wait area and no one was paying attention to us coming in.  SO, I just walked in past the area into the restaurant bar.  The bar was full.  There was some stand up tables with space so I stood there, no service.  No one to ask.  Disappointed.  Left without a drop of beer.  Hope they clear up this service issue.  Personal preference, but I feel a brewery type place is not for kids."}
{"text":"Second time eating at southern tier, been in in between for beer only. Started off all wrong it took 15 minutes for someone to approach our table. We got the shrimp appetizer it was delicious. I got the hanger steak again it was ok this time a little undercooked I asked for medium and it was med-rare and cold. My fiancé got a burger it was good and cooked to his liking. They seemed to forget about our sons food and it came out much later in which was comped so that was very nice. I guess they were just having an off night Megan our sever was still awesome and the beer was great as always. Won't give up on you though!!!!"}
{"text":"Best atmosphere, food, and drinks combined at the Norh Shore! Just neat takes on upscale bar food! Highly recommend the parm cauliflower and nachos! Definitely a must do over Rivertowne, Tequila Cowboy, or Tilted kilt."}
{"text":"I've been to Southern Tier Brewing a couple of times before, but last night's experience warranted a review. Our party of four arrived for dinner prior to a concert at nearby Stage AE. We were quickly seated and our server Jon greeted us with unexpected humor and enthusiasm. Our interactions with him elevated our entire experience. He was fun and attentive throughout our visit and no one waited for more than a couple of minutes for anything.  I'm not sure if they were operating under their limited Game Day Menu or if they've just redesigned since my last visit, but the menu still had plenty of options and something for everyone. I had the Smoked Pulled Pork with the side salad. It was well-made and satisfying. Everyone at the table ordered something different off of the menu and our food all arrived quickly.  If you go to Southern Tier you will not be disappointed, and if you happen to be lucky enough to have Jon as your server you are in for an especially enjoyable evening!"}
{"text":"I was here for a business event - it may be better with a smaller group.  The waiter was great and suggested a good beer, of which I had many.  We ordered around the appetizer menu and got a nice variety, but nothing I would come back for specifically.  I recommend this a place to meet a few friends, have a good drink and then head off to the next thing."}
{"text":"I had been anxiously awaiting to check out this place for quite some time and in some ways it didn't disappoint - but my overall experience definitely had some down falls.   I checked them out on a beautiful spring Sunday afternoon and we arrived the Biergarten was packed, as expected! I was with family so we decided to sit inside. I was extremely disappointed when we were greeted with VERY abbreviated \"game day menus\" that paled in comparison to the menu I had checked out online. The kicker is - it wasn't a game day! The waiter told us it was due to a busy weekend and food taking a long time to come out, but our food still took almost 45 minutes. I was mostly disappointed that many of the healthier options had been removed from the menu such as the salads.   I ended up ordering the walnut crusted salmon and it was DELICIOUS. It sorta made up for the lackluster experience thus far. I loved the atmosphere and I want to experience the biergarten portion with awesome north shore views. I'll be back to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Had our rehearsal dinner here and were told we would have semi private table.  That did not happen and is not possible of happening.  Despite my annoyance with that, the manager was absolutely excellent.  He gave us free apps and first round for the misunderstanding and gifts for our whole party as well.  This one incident aside which was ultimately very positive, beer is excellent and so is the food.  For what it is, it's as good as it can be.  Outdoor seating now too."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here yesterday. The atmosphere is very hipster. I've heard it can be very crowded here so I was glad to catch it during a slow time. My sister and I walked right in and sat at the bar. We were served immediately. Neither of us a beer drinkers. Why go, right? We will try anything! Not being beer drinkers we split a flight. They have a large menu and the bartender talked us through some things we might like. It was quiet the experience! Turns out I like darker beers, ha! They have a large variety for all beer drinks.   Great addition to the North Shore. The patio we snow covered, but it looks great. Looking forward to visiting again in the summer."}
{"text":"I came here with a small group during a Pens game. We were seated pretty quickly, especially considering the circumstances. It was also nice at first glance to see how spacious the area seemed; didn't appear to be cramped at all. I started with the Pumpking. It was pretty good, I have to say, but I'm a sucker for all things pumpkin. I also ordered nachos. The portion size and price were pleasantly surprising for a small, and the ingredients were all fresh and tasty, but what disappointed me were the tortilla chips. Usually when you order nachos, you're bound to get a soggy chip here and there from all the toppings, but these ones were all soggy and not crispy at all. I was still able to eat them though; like I said, the toppings were all fresh and tasty. I ordered another beer, this time going with a cherry gose. It was decent. Maybe a bit too sour for my taste, but not bad. Through all of this, the service was pretty good. The waitress was pretty attentive, but tried a bit too hard with up selling. I went to the bar once because I needed change for the T ride home, and even though it was pretty crowded, I was happy with how quickly and pleasantly the bartender waited on me. Overall, I probably wouldn't come here again by choice, especially because the beers are a bit pricy for what I think they're worth, but would be fine with coming here now and again if a friend suggested it."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, good service. This place was the ultimate trifecta. We brought my daughter who is 11 months old. It is super kid friendly. We got seated immediately at 6pm. Our server was great. I ordered the veggie burger. The fried egg on it was incredible. My husband got the open faced meatloaf. He loved it, I tried a bite and it tasted similar to hot sausage. Different but good.  They have a family bathroom that is really nice if you have a baby!  I had the old man winter ale and cinnamon roll beer. Both were delicious. I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Went to STB for the first time on Friday after work. Great location, great addition to the north side. It was a little annoying that they wouldn't seat us until our party was all there but the hostess' were all super nice. Once seated we were waited on rather promptly. We shared some appetizers including the pork nachos, skillet fries, pretzels and corn dip. Everything was delicious. They didn't have any liquor or wine selections but advised it was coming soon. I hope they create some happy hour specials. I'm already looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I travel to Pittsburgh regular and this is one of my favorite restaurants. The beer selection is almost overwhelming but I haven't had a bad one yet. I typically have a Tangiers IPA. The food is great in many ways. The menu selection is limited but the food is great. My favorite item is the maple salmon. Highly recommend if your on the north shore."}
{"text":"Southern Tier- Pittsburgh  This place has been on our list for a very long time because we fell in love with their beers starting with THE Pumking, then the Warlock, and nearly every one of their releases became a treat worth waiting for.  Cold as it was, we headed to the brewery near Heinz Field. As soon as we went inside to the packed house (it was a Saturday around 4pm) and the music was blasting Zeppelin, already a plus one. Classic rock and then a mix of rock/modern tunes blared at loud but not offensive volume.  Wooden high tables, lower tables and a long bar are offered. My better-half got a glass of the dessert- worthy (but not too sweet) Cinnamon Roll while I got a sampler of 5 handpicked IPAs, 5oz each. I went for beers I had not had on tap before or ever: Loud House IPA, 2xTangier, 2xIPA, 2xSMASH, and Unearthly...the Unearthly was our favorite but all rocked!!!! The hops are just what you would expect from Southern Tier, rich flavors, well balanced and West-Coast inspired hops. Then, my better-half then got a Pumking 2017 while I got 5oz. of 2XMAS,  2xOak'd IPA and the guest beer Victory Dirtywolf. Good stuff.  Could have stayed all night but we had dinner plans elsewhere. Southern Tier food looked good-to-\"above average\" bar fare so would have enjoyed eating there but we only were visiting for 1.5 days so had to maximize our time. Love this place. Please build one in near DC!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for some drinks while in the neighborhood and was real pleased that I did so.   This is a relatively new brewhouse that opened up earlier this year. It's a branch operation of Southern Tier, which is a New York brewery. They brew some of their own beer and also have Southern Tier beer from New York. The same company owns Victory Brewing, and this location serves some Victory beers (like the Golden Monkey, which is a real good beer).   I've had some Southern Tier at other bars, but was surprised to see how extensive their beer selection is. This location has a large number of beers on tap in different styles. I had a couple of dark beers that were excellent.   The layout of the restaurant is very nice, with a beer garden outside that's good in warm weather, a long bar inside with a lot of stools, and many benches and tables inside. The inside has a very spacious feel, but at the same time is warm and inviting. There are a lot of very good high definition screens playing sports events. This would be an excellent place to watch a game.   There is a full menu, but I didn't have any food.   This is a great spot for having a nice evening out. I'd definitely come again, even though I'm on the other side of town."}
{"text":"I hadn't been before, but my sister and BIL raved about this place, however this go-round was just okay. The food was delish and the space is great. But our server didn't write down orders (what's with that? I see it all the time...but I digress) and we're pretty sure the guys never got the actual beers they ordered. Both are very knowledgeable about their suds, so i have to trust them on that. I enjoyed my cherry Gose, so at least I left happy...after all, I write these reviews"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here. First time I had food. The open layout with rustic wood decor makes it a great atmosphere.  As always, the beers a fresh and delicious. Artisanal Brewing Ventures did a great job combining 2 great breweries.    The food was tasty. We just had some appetizers but you can tell it's quality food.   My only complaint is the huge outdoor area still isn't done. I don't know what the deal is but today is 80 degrees and sunny and I'm looking at a huge unfinished patio area.  I really hope it gets finished soon as it could be a great space."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this weekend. The beer and food were great! I highly recommend the cold brew pumpkin coffee beer. It's delicious and unique. We had a 45 minute wait which was expected for the weekend / opening week.   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was for the seating arrangement. Almost all of the tables had 6+ seats so there was a high chance that you would be seated with another couple. I'm not sure why the decision was made to do this instead of the use of smaller tables so that you can have a more private dining experience, but it was weird with only about 2ft of space in between you and a stranger."}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon.  Service was super good, but it was a slow time of the day.  Our server was super helpful with the beers and our flight selections.  Menu is solid but somewhat limited.  Highly recommend the Parmesan Cauliflower app.  Interior is cool and looks like it will be a great place in the summer with all of the open air space. All of that said you come here for the beer.  I love Southern Tier, and the beer selection is fantastic and tasty. Tons of stuff you won't find outside of here or the home base in NY.  They even have guest taps from Victory."}
{"text":"Southern tier was incredible. Great service and great food. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I got here before 6p. Wasn't very busy. I got my drink order quickly but than my bar tender never return. I had to ask another bartender to help me with my food order. I ordered Fish and Chips and I guess I had a different expectations for my food. Not good. I didn't like the breading on the fish. The fry's were ok but not my style of fries. When I opened my sandwich the spread was just blobbed on and not spread on the bread. My second bartender was nice. They made it right and didn't charge me for my dinner. I'm not from here so I will not be returning to this place. The locals posted a better food experience so maybe I just didn't order the right thing."}
{"text":"Meh... Southern Tier left a lot to be desired. Overall I dont follow the hype of this New York based brewery as their beer is just middle of the road craft beer and their food is sub par at best. On our visit we had the Southern Tier burger. This burger sounds amazing but had way to much going on.... I know I never thought I'd say that either, but honestly the flavors were just to much. The Beer cheese stuffed in the burger was just nasty. This burger had an army of flavors that in the end killed my every last taste bud. As for the beer... I've had better home brews. Overall I'd hit up Rivertowne or Burgatory if on the north shore again. Sorry Southern Tier... I really wanted to like you."}
{"text":"The Southern Tier burger was amazing. Also had some wings which were delicious. Only weird thing was the wings did not come with any celery.  The prices were very reasonable especially for the Being in the North Shore.  Def going back soon."}
{"text":"Great beer menu, my favorite is the Cherry Gose. Staff is friendly, food is delicious. Haven't tried anything I don't like yet! One of my favorite spots on the north shore. Only thing that could make it better would be to add a place to hang outside."}
{"text":"Don't go for dinner. The kitchen will get too busy. You will see tons of open tables with no one sitting while you wait for hours because they can't handle any sort of crowd. Terrible."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday early evening, waited about an hour for a table for 6, but was definitely worth it. This place had tons of beer to choose from; I enjoyed the beer flight, which was only $12.50.  Food ordered included the rib sandwich, fish sandwich, chicken plate of some sort, pretzel bites, and shrimp dish (5 shrimp in some sort of sticky sauce- which was AMAZING- so good in fact, that I ordered aka 2nd helping- although they were $11 per helpinf). The sandwich bun on the fish was fresh and tasty, although the fish itself lacked flavor and seasoning. It would have been so much better heavily seasoned.   The server was good and knowledgeable. She was attentive and helped with decisions and was more than willing to split the check at the end. The only downside I can say, is the ladies room was a mess. More than one stall was out of paper and I thought it was pretty early for that. Atmosphere is a little on the loud side, but taking into consideration that it was Saturday night, I guess that's to be expected. I can't wait to try more menu items (and beer- never got around to the creme broulee flavor, as planned) during our next visit!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to see a Southern Tier pub during a recent trip to Pittsburgh with my parents but sure enough, there is a location right next to the sports complexes on the north shore of Pittsburgh. The area was extremely dead during a summer weekend afternoon but that didn't stop the crowds of 30-somethings with small children from being inside this pub. I have never seen so many white families with small children drinking so much beer.  The staff were ok and the food and drinks were average at best. We had the quesadilla and the cauliflower as well as some beers and I wasn't too impressed with any of them. The prices were extremely cheap so that made up for the lack of quality.  Overall, this is a place that makes sense in a sports complex. It is a good choice for watching TV and drinking and eating mediocre beers and snacks. I can't say I would ever go back but I am glad I came here once as I enjoy trying new beers with my parents."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to Southern Tier's brewpub opening up here in Pittsburgh for a while now, and it is definitely worth the hype! There is something for everyone with a full food menu, generous draft list, and small retail area in the front. I'm sure I'll be back if only to pick myself up a custom six-pack every now and then.  I came with a group of six on a busy evening and we were seated promptly by the friendly and professional host staff. Our server did a marvelous job explaining the flight system and taking our various food orders (some wanted dinner, one person had dessert, and three people had flights of different sizes) and the entire experience was very smooth. Drafts run $5-$6 I believe, and the 5-oz pours are $2 each. You can build a flight of up to five, but I opted for three. It was nice having the flexibility to order as much or little as I wanted. I tried the Oaked IPA, the Nu School IPA, and the Cold Press Coffee Pumpking. The last one was probably my favorite, due to it being such a surprising mix of flavors that worked well together. I'm already planning to go back this weekend and try more of what they currently have on draft."}
{"text":"Southern tier burger!!! Bacon, cheese Orion rings! Nothing will go wrong on this combination!! Came here on a Thursday night right after work and it got fill up very quickly! I can see this place being packed on a Friday night and the weekends. It can get loud once it's full, but who cares when you have burger and beer in hand. The decorations is very modern and I would say this place is worth to check out!"}
{"text":"Came out with co workers for a fair well party. Food was tasty and had a decent selection of beers in tap. Beers were reasonable and server was attentive without being overbearing. If looking for a casual spot before or after a Pirates game stop over."}
{"text":"I would actually give this 5 stars for the beer and 3.5 stars for the food. Except for the nachos, because cheese sauce made from scratch + fresh jalapenos + lime juice on top resulting in the best nachos I've ever had in a restaurant deserves 5 stars. But just for the nachos. The cob wedge salad was completely forgettable and a disaster when it comes to plating  (plastic dressing cup, oi). But like I said, if you come for the beer this place is top notch. I especially enjoyed the lime sour. I love that they have suggested flights or design your own. The wait was hellishly long  (2 hrs on a Friday night), but rivertown is right across the street for a little pre-game while you wait."}
{"text":"The beers - great. Our waiter (Malik) - excellent. The food - meh.   If you've had Southern Tier's beers before, you know what to expect. The menu is IPA heavy, but there are still a lot of other options. I was happy to see a few sours available since those are harder to come by on the North Shore/in corporate brew pubs. As other reviewers mentioned, the flight of five 5oz beers is a good deal for $12.50.   The staff all seemed to have everything together. Our waiter was friendly, personable, knowable, and somehow managed to find the perfect balance of checking in just enough. That is so rare when a place is packed like it was during our visit.   Now the food... We only had apps but they were hit & miss. The shrimp was well cooked, large, and flavorful. I'd definitely order those again. The pulled pork nachos were pretty much a giant salt lick. The tortillas were coated in huge salt crystals. The sweetness of the BBQ pork was barely able to fight the intense saltiness of those chips.   I'd go back to try main dishes next time. I've heard good things about the sandwiches. Hopefully the nachos were a one time oops."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open. I visited the location in Lakewood NY and when I found out a Southern Tier was coming to the Burgh.. I freaked out. Needless to say this place is typically pretty busy, so expect a wait when you come- especially if it's the day of a game (Pirates or Steelers). I love all of their beer, and recommend that you try a flight, in order to try the most brews! I haven't tried any of their entrees yet, but did try their shrimp appetizer, which tasted so fresh and was really tasty. The shrimp were huge and so juicy. Just be mindful of when you visit and expect a wait- you'll have a great time! Can't wait until the beer garden opens!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was good, management was very nice and accommodating when I had a personal dislike with one item I ordered. Will definitely return and this will become one of my regular places in the Burg!"}
{"text":"I am a native of Jamestown/Lakewood, where Southern Tier is from and just happen to be a fan of their beer in general, so I was excited to try the new Pittsburgh location out. Sort of interesting to see some of the other reviews. Considering the North Shore area seems to be populated around the park by chain/corporate places, I think STBC is a great addition considering their status as a brewery in the whole country. You have more taps than the actual brewery, a really sold food menu, great location, and nice atmosphere.  We got there before 11:30 for a 1:30 Pirates game (wearing the gear of the opposing team) and were seated immediately. Had one waitress who took drink orders, but Bradshaw came over and said there was a little confusion as we were his table. He was very attentive and cordial, even though the original waitress only passed along half our drink order. Bradshaw immediately got my flight and then checked in during the meal at convenient times.  Even though I have had just about every STBC on the menu, I went with the Hop Head flight and my brother tried the Lemon Drop Sun.   I went with the chicken sandwich. On nicely grilled bread, and a combination of cooked peppers/onions and a tomato jam, it was tasty with Gruyere cheese which could have been a smidge more melty. My brother went with the Southern Tier burger which he wolfed down. Fresh toppings and a hot onion ring sealed it for him. We both enjoyed the fresh fried chips, which you get a ton of. I'd love to see these items on the menu at the Lakewood brewery! All in all, it was a good meal and speedily brought out on a busy day so that we were quickly on our way to the ballpark, but didn't feel rushed. It was very pleasant to sit with their garage doors open. It looks like a patio might be in order next?   I can see how some may see this as a restaurant first and then a brewery, but I think they have a really good menu for a brewery, especially since they have a very limited menu at the actual brewery and this is there first go of a place like this. As a STBC supporter/fan, I am happy to see them succeed!"}
{"text":"The beer is top-notch, the food pretty good bar food, but the service seems to be suffering from growing pains. The place is pretty loud: even half-full we had to shout at each other across the table. Personally if I'm going to have to yell I might as well drink a cheap-ass Trump beer like Yunegling."}
{"text":"Always been a big fan of Southern Tier. While in Pittsburgh decided to stop at the brew house and try some new beers, turns out the menu is pretty solid (though short). My wife had the grilled chicken club and loved it, I tried out the pastrami Reuben which I think is one of the better Reuben's I've had out there (nice mix of sweet from the onions, sour from the sauerkraut and sourdough and savory with the thousand island and thin slice pastrami. Tried Mokah for the first time which was so smooth and rich with flavor and Lemon Drop Sun wasn't too bad either. Only regret was I left without taking a Sapsquatch with me from the gift shop up front. Definitely worth a stop for any die hard beer fans!"}
{"text":"Came here last night on a first date. I am not a beer drinker, so I was thrilled to see they also have a full bar and I was able to enjoy a cocktail. I got the ginger cosmo. It was tasty at first but about halfway through was feeling super thick and syrupy. I'm glad i tried it but I wouldn't get it again.  They also have a food menu, so we got some grub. For an app we tried the crispy cauliflower. It was really good, but the sauce they served it with was some super thick, white, garlic flavored mayo. They would do better with a thinner, lighter sauce of a different flavor. Maybe something with a little spicy kick. The sauce absolutely did not enhance the cauliflower and in fact, made it less enjoyable.  I got a salad and it was very plain and unexciting, and had more of the fried cauliflower on it. Had I realized, I would have gotten a different salad, but I will say, the vinegairette they used was fantastic and I stopped caring that my salad consisted of only lettuce and fried cauliflower.  My date get the baked chicken and it looked amazing. He let me sample it and it was, in fact, quite delicious. We couldn't identify the bright yellow sauce on the plate, but it was real good with the chicken.  Our servers were all super great and not up in our space while we were talking and eating.  I think it's a pretty cool spot. I'd def come back and try some other food items."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful summer day, the weather is just right and you're strolling parallel to an inviting park and Heinz field is right behind you (and I mean, literally... RIGHT behind you) where do you eat along the strip of enticing and well-groomed restaurants? Two words - Southern Tier. Not a beer drinker? Try the food! Only want to eat somewhere with friendly service that wants to do right by your experience alone? Come here! But really, and most importantly - try the 3 Citra Peel if it's on draft. Very flavor forward and at 8.6% (?) it's sure to be drink that starts your experience here on the right foot."}
{"text":"Really great brewery near the stadiums in Pittsburgh. Outstanding beer selection, thought that several were tasty. Spacious, great layout, awesome service. Everything a larger brewery should be."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and stopped again last night.   They always have a variety of beers on tap.  And last night did not disappoint.  Had a flight and tasted a few new ones.  My son loved his Mac and cheese.  The Reuben was really good.  Great atmosphere.  Great place."}
{"text":"This is a really cool spot, especially now that the outdoor area is open. Went here after a Pirates game, was surprised to see the large outdoor area open as I had no idea they were building it! Everything inside and outside seems very clean and maintained well. Their beers are excellent, I had the Gose they had on draft. Their food menu is expansive, more than your average pub food for sure. I'll say too, I was with a friend who was \"a bit\" inebriated and broke a glass, two staff members came by and were very kind and understanding, helped clean up and got us bandaids. Overall a great experience, I'm sure this place will be very popular this summer."}
{"text":"It helps to have great wait staff like Dylan.  He was knowledgeable of the beers, menu and local attractions.  We had the wings and they were very good."}
{"text":"Myself and two others sat at the bar for about five minutes, and all bartenders avoided eye contact. I finally had to ask, a bit louder than the first time, for some assistance, and got an eye roll... Justin took two of the three orders and then made the third person in my group wait, rang both drinks under my card that we did receive as well.   I've never paid 10$ for a drink and gotten a glass LESS than half full, or as much foam on my friends beer. (Foam was scooped out before picture)  If my drink wasn't strong and tasted well, you would've gotten one star."}
{"text":"It has a great location, awesome atmosphere and was within walking distance of our hotel and Stage AE. We stopped here for an early dinner and loved it. My wife and I started with the Pretzel Bites and then both opted for some burgers (Southern Tier and BBQ Smokehouse). Everything was delicious and the burgers were pretty huge. Being a craft beer enthusiast and a Southern Tier fan I really enjoyed the beer. There was a wide variety of everything that Southern Tier offers as well as some choices from their brothers at Victory Brewing. I went with a pint of one of the Pittsburgh brewed beers and then followed it up with a flight of the rest of the beers that were brewed right there on-premise. The service was helpful, great and timely. We even stopped back after the concert and got a 6-pack to go. I will definitely coming back whenever I get the chance."}
{"text":"Southern Tier has been one of the crown jewels for craft beer in our area for a number of years. Excellent selection and a few beers only available at this location. Definitely recommend a beer flight to try a number of them. Went for the beer which we already knew was great, and was really impressed with the quality of the food. The menu had fewer choices than typically available but everything was fresh and deliciously prepared. Much better than above average bar grub. With both award winning craft beers and delicious food, this place is among the best I've been to in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Southern Tier is an awesome place to have here in Pittsburgh. It's one of my favorite places to grab a beer in the North Shore. It's best to come on a week night when there isn't an event happening at Stage AE, Heinz Field, or PNC Park.   I arrived earlier than my friend, so I was able to grab a low top table in the back of the restaurant. Some of tables are close together, but we had enough room to be comfortable.   To start, I ordered a flight of 5 different beers. The servers now give you a little slip to fill out of the beers you want and then they pass them to the bartenders. My favorite beer was 'Live' - my least favorite was '8 Days a Week'   Once my friend arrived, we ordered the nachos and homemade pretzel with beer cheese to share. If you are hungry for nachos or in a large group - order the large nachos. You won't be disappointed. These are some of my favorite nachos in Pittsburgh. The homemade pretzel was good, but wasn't soft and chewy enough for me.   I ended the evening by ordering a 2X Smash, but I wasn't the biggest fan, so I'd order a Live next time.   I'll be back soon to Southern Tier! Can't wait until it gets a little warmer and we can hang out in the Bier garden."}
{"text":"We stopped in mid Sunday afternoon on opening weekend. Place was packed! Tough to get near the bar but I managed a couple drafts and we opted to put our names in for a table. Wait was projected at 45 minutes but we were seated in less than half that time.   The space is quite nice with a large bar and there will be plenty of seating once they get through the initial curiosity rush of patrons over the next couple months. I liked that there wasn't loud music blasting all over so you really could enjoy sitting there with food, drink, and friends. Their beer list is on a huge multi page screen above the bar with tons of selections. I've never been a huge fan of Southern Tier brews but if you are, you can get your fill here. I tried 3 IPA's this time and still haven't found one that works for me.  For future reference I noted that they do offer other breweries on tap - including Victory Hop Devil which I do like.   I ordered a Southern Tier burger which I wanted cooked medium. Server said their burgers are all cooked \"smashed\" on a flat top not on a grill and are only available well done. It turned out ok - pretty standard bar food quality. My choice of a side was the \"salad\" which turned out to be a handful of overdressed bagged lettuce. That's not a salad. My wife opted for the chicken sandwich which was acceptable but not memorable.   Servers handled the crowds expertly and are to be commended. All in all I'd give it 3 stars - A OK. Once the crowds thin out I'll be back. I'll order that Hop Devil."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a beer or two. I have tried seven different  beers and they were all delicious, plenty options for everyone to choose their favorite. Service was nice and the place has fun & upbeat atmosphere.   I have been there twice and it seems to be completely different experience if you come around 2 PM or at around 7 PM. It looked like it gets really crowded and busy in the evening even during week days, so I enjoyed it better earlier in the afternoon."}
{"text":"They have really good beer here. Aside from that the food is good but what you would expect out of brewpub, burgers and the such."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised with STB, considering I usually don't love pub-like places. They have a great beer selection and some very unique ones too. If you'd like to explore some beers with a neat, the Imperial Cinnamon Roll Ale, Salted Caramel Stout, Creme and Brulee Stout were my favorites.  For eats, the Roasted Corn Dip is a must have.  There is just the right amount of tortilla chips to dip.  Usually its too much chips and not enough dip -_- I also decided to indulge in the Broccoli Beer Cheddar Crock and it was worth every calorie."}
{"text":"I am home on vacation, came here on a Sunday with some friends. First time here. Maggie was our sever. SHE IS THE BEST!! Great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place from the food to the drinks to the environment even the employees this place is a home run, my only complaint is every time I have gone the place is just so busy!! I would recommend this place to anyone whether you are looking for a quick drink, some good food, or a full out night on the town you cant miss with this brewery."}
{"text":"I love Southern Tier before a Pitt game.  Beer is excellent and food is good.  I can't wait until next year for Pumpking and a sunny fall day.  You can't go wrong with the wings, very good.  Burgers are good also.  Service is prompt and friendly.  The outdoor space recently opened is great in the summer for a gose."}
{"text":"There are so many positives about Southern Tier Brewery. I am so excited to come back, hands down the best beer in Pittsburgh. It doesn't matter what type of beer you're in the mood for, Southern Tier has the perfect brew for you.   I have been here a couple times and I've never had a beer I didn't love. I'm a big fan of strong sour beers, this is one of if not the only places in the area that offers high ABV smooth sours.   I felt the Cherry Gose was a standout beer, possibly my new favorite sour. Coming in at 8.2 percent one may anticipate a slightly \"cough medicine taste\" that is simply not the case with this Gose. The Cherry Gose was an extremely tasty beer but not overly sweet and had a very clean finish. I had a couple of these as well as a sour monkey and a unique hybrid beer.  For the first time ever, I had a waitress recommend mixing the Lime Sour with the Cherry Gose...WOW! Cherry limeade beer, it reminded me of a slushy from Sonic, except it was 8% Alcohol.  Great recommendation and fantastic service!  I think the key to success is having a friendly knowledgeable staff and Southern Tier clearly has some great employees! The manager was also extremely friendly and it's obvious that this is a company that stands behind their products.  I love that you can order food pretty late into the night, and everything was pretty tasty and reasonably priced. There are many great food options on the menu and even a picky eater like myself can find something to eat.   I'm excited to come back and grab drinks here! This is the perfect place to start your night at, after a couple strong beers you can walk 100 feet up the road and stop into Tequila Cowboys for a more energetic atmosphere.   Looking forward to coming back, I highly recommend Souther Tier Brewery!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with my first experience here! I've heard a lot of hype around town and I would say that it lived up to its reputation for me.   It's A LOT smaller than I thought, not nearly as big as some other places on the North Shore, so expect to wait a little bit if you go at a busy time. Go grab a drink at the bar while you wait. We arrived around 5:15 on a Friday and only waited about 20 minutes, even though they told us 40 minutes.  I have always been a big fan of their beer, specifically the 2X IPA. I decided to try the 2X Smash Double IPA and was equally impressed! I had the Grilled Portabella Fettuccini and I loved it. No one at the table was a fan of the dijonaisse that came with the pretzel bites, so we asked for a bit of beer cheese instead. That should definitely be an option to have with the pretzels!"}
{"text":"My 5 stars is for what ST is trying to be. It succeeds. From the best beer and beer menu in Pittsburgh to the excellent apps, sandwiches and plates, ST brings it all the time. Atmosphere is great. My favorite is the steak and meatloaf dishes. Also, their distilled liquors are under appreciated for being the micro brews they are. Love this place."}
{"text":"Great spot to watch the Penguin game. We had a party of six that enjoyed dinner and drinks for the playoff game. Overall, the space was very nice, food and drinks were delicious, and there were plenty of TVs to watch the pens! We split nachos as a table, then I ordered the ginger cosmo and veggie burger with side salad. The veggie burger was very filling and had a fried egg on top! Definitely a fun spot for dinner downtown. The waitress was also very accommodating when a drink order was mixed up."}
{"text":"Our meal was amazing! The only thing that was better was the service,  Emily our server seemed to know what we wanted before we did,  she is the perfect example of what a server should be! Our food was served perfectly hot and fresh our drinks were cold and refreshing and refilled promptly. Emily's suggestions were divine and I truly couldn't have enjoyed my experience anymore! Thank you Smitty for the delicious appetizer!! We will be back after this perfect meal!! Southern Tier is perfection!"}
{"text":"Really excited about Southern Tier coming to Pittsburgh and got the chance to stop by opening week. When we arrived, they told us the restaurant/bar was at capacity and we could wait and have a beer in the lobby/store. Of course we did and put our name on the wait list. When the text arrived and said we had a 4 hrs 30 minute wait to be seated, we laughed. But, it did take 1.5 hrs to get the come hither, your table is ready text.   There were a number of people with children waiting. My only suggestion is that you don't bring them hungry; they'll never be able to wait that long...and I don't anticipate that it will be a shorter wait anytime soon. Grab a six pack of your favorite to go instead; your children will be happier.  The beer is delicious with a wide arrange of choices, and the flight. The kitchen won't win any awards, but we expected bar food and that's what we got. We'll definitely go back again, probably in the summer when the beer garden opens. Loved the Warlock."}
{"text":"We love this place but only during off hours or days. Otherwise it's CRaZY busy! I used to think the restaurant felt very cramped but during our most recent visit we saw that they doubled the size of the bar and now have outside seating.   Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable. She was able to recommend great beers and food. Southern Tier will now become a frequent stop for us while biking in the summer."}
{"text":"Do not go here. They were incredibly rude. We got there right after the stadium series game. We were told to not bother putting our names on the wait list because it would take too long. Once we got in and saw there was numerous tables empty, we asked to be put on the wait list and we're sat right away. So why didn't they want to seat us when we first got there? Then, They close at 12:00 and did last call at 11:50. At 12:15 they flashed the lights and told us to \"get out\". When we tried to explain that we just got our beers and we're trying to enjoy them we were told \"where did you learn to chug?!\" Needless to say, my fiancée got a little angry. Then, on the way out he tried to apologize for getting defensive. The response was \"ok great make your way to the door\".  The entire time we were there we were treated very poorly. We left completely disgusted with the entire experience and we really try to give everyone, especially newer places, the benefit of the doubt and some leeway. But they were so rude I cannot justify giving them anything more than one star. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a short trip to Pittsburgh and we were happy we made the visit! It's a cool brewery/restaurant, with a small store at the front and tons of tables a little further back. It seems like a great place for large groups. There's a lot of space!   Service was a little less than ideal. It took us several minutes to be seated and at some points our server seemed to be busier with replacing old menus rather than serving. However, it was still pretty good service.   For my drink, I decided to order a flight. What bothered me the most about this place was there were like 5 beers at the beginning that I was told they were out of and couldn't order. One of these was Pumking, which happens to be advertised like crazy on their website and i definitely planned to order it. It was annoying having my options limited. However, luckily they have a huge beer menu and I was still able to find my 5 beers for the flight. I did enjoy them! We split nachos and pretzels as a table and loved them both. Sub the pretzel dip out for the beer cheese. We really liked both appetizers.   If I lived in the area, I would come back again. But I don't, so all I can say was that it was a good place to stop in and get during my visit!"}
{"text":"This Southern Tier outpost seriously impressed me. I've never been a gung-ho ST fan in the past, but I'll drink their stuff if I see it on tap. Their Pittsburgh location is gorgeous, open, and fresh. Staff is so welcoming too!  I was traveling solo so I sat at the bar. It was a hot, sticky day, but inside it was dim and casual with a nice breeze from the open doors. I was able to craft my own flight of two goses, an herby beer, and a raspberry wheat at $2.50 each. It was lunchtime, so I also ordered a chicken caesar salad.   I always feel silly ordering basic salads in new cities, but Gabby insisted it was a good choice. And it was! I ordered it without tomatoes, but the grilled chicken and dressing were both delicious. It was a good serving size, too, and I was able to finish it without feeling full.  The beers were refreshing, and it was so nice to chat with Gabby throughout my visit. She shared lots of great suggestions for the rest of my day's agenda too, which was awesome.  The tap room is large and hosts a huge bar, lots of tables, insight into their brewing process, and a merch section up front, which includes bottles to go. It's everything you could want from an established brewery, and it's close to the stadium, so I'd bet that's a huge pull.  I don't have anything poor to say about my experience, and I'd definitely consider a return if I found myself back in Pittsburgh one day."}
{"text":"Wow! Food is amazing. Beers are even more amazing! Love the festive mood. Seasonal flavors are the best I've tried anywhere. The staff is great. This is a great place to hang with friends and watch a game."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. We were quoted a half an hour wait. It ended up being more like 45, partly because a couple that came in after us was seated before us.  Once we were seated, the service was good. My husband had a beer flight & said the beer was excellent. I don't like beer, so I had a glass of wine, wishing Arsenal Cider was on tap. We got the smoked brown sugar BBQ wings as an appetizer - delicious. My husband had the pastrami sandwich with homemade chips, and I had the chicken sandwich with fries - both very good."}
{"text":"Their beer is definitely hop heavy, but that's not a bad thing. They have other choices for those who don't like hoppy beers. My favorites are the Phin & Matt's and Live. The food is great too! You have to try the smoked BBQ wings!"}
{"text":"After a delicious dinner at Gaucho me and my boyfriend decided to check out Southern Tier.  We didn't get any food but by the looks of everything the servers were bringing out of the kitchen I can't wait to try it! Everything looked delicious!  We did sample some of the beers and they were amazing. I especially liked the Mokah American Imperial Stout and Choklat. I was impressed with our waiter and how knowledgeable he was about each beer we inquired about. All the staff was friendly and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has terrible beer. Tries to be cute by half. For some reason they think an IPA should have citrus. Ordered a Pilsner that I sent back."}
{"text":"From Service to drinks to Food, Everything  was fantastic. We sat at the bar and the female bartender (sorry didn't get her name but we were there on 2/20/17 at about 2pm) was the best, she was smiling and just what you would want your wait staff to be and answered all our questions and just was the best.   After a few samples I picked the ginger beer and hubby had the pumking.  I had the delicious mushroom fettuccini and he had the southwest burger both were great. We bought a few of the green shirts to wear for st patrick's day and even the hostess were great during that transaction. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a brew and food.  Perfect location between the two stadiums in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Food and beer were good (recommend the nachos) but was offended by the service and will not return to this establishment.  I ordered a listed sampler (tier something) mostly because I like samplers but especially because it had a raspberry wheat listed.  The waiter came back and said they didn't have the raspberry wheat so he order something else for me instead (a different wheat tri fruit thing); I asked if it was the lemon one and he so no - that's terrible, you want this one - trust me.  (Did I have a choice?  He didn't offer one.). As it turns out, the beer was tasty but had an ABV of 8.6 (I don't order craft beer above 6.0).  I guess I don't understand why he just didn't ask me to pick something else rather than choosing for me.  I thought he was trying to be helpful, but then other \"signals\" finally figured it out.  Later, my husband order a beer that we were going to split.  After the waiter left, my son wanted a dessert so when I saw the waiter, I said excuse me.  He was dismissive and said, don't worry sweetie, your beer is coming.  After we finally got our beer and dessert (which my son had to order later) he was just gone - missing for at least 10 minutes and no one came to help us or mention he was on break.   So we flagged someone else down and requested a to go container.   Waited some more - didn't see him and then asked another staff member for our bill.   Right after we made this request - he reappeared and we assume was told our request by the person we had flagged down as she had gone straight to him.  I had my credit card out and ready to pay when he showed up with 5 bills - separate checks for the five men sitting next to us, that had arrived well after us and appeared to have received exceptional service.  He looked at me and said, don't worry I'll get your card shortly.  While he processed the men's bills, I was clearly upset but just wanted to get out of there.  Then he comes over and rubs my back and asks if everything is ok?!!   I couldn't /wouldn't articulate my feelings.  He went to take my credit card from me and I requested that I see the bill first.  (He got it, I paid, we left).  Almost 24 hours later, I still feel uncomfortable with the experience and will not go back until the staff is trained in sensitivity training and service- never assume what a customer wants, ask, don't call women sweetie and don't rub their backs.  Any one of these could possibly be ignored but as they say, threes a charm."}
{"text":"Good location. Delicious food. Flavorful brews. Reasonable prices.  These are just a few of the highlights from my recent visits to Southern Tier Brewing. Yesterday Courtney took good care of my friend and I during the lunch hour.   I enjoyed the Big Ol Pastrami Reuben with french fries. The bread was perfectly toasted. The house made kraut had a sweet, caramelized onion taste. The fries were crispy with a side of thick, fresh ranch dressing. My friend told me her Smokey Bleu Cheese Wedge was fresh, flavorful and satisfying.  I was disappointed that my favorite brew, the Southern Tier Raspberry White wasn't on tap anymore, however I did snag a six-pack for home! With my lunch I enjoyed a 3 Citrus Peel Out which was good for a sunny, warm spring day on the patio. I look forward to next time..."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere, great beer and most importantly the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh. This is a place you can go with some friends and have a good time and eat great food and drink good beer. I will surely be returning."}
{"text":"The place was packed for the family and friends soft opening. My friend invited me with one of his passes he was lucky enough to receive. It was a shame I'd already eaten dinner, the menu looks really good. I'll have to try the food next time. I did enjoy the beer.   I tried a few of the IPA offerings, Nu Skool & the Tangerine IPA, the name escapes me at the time of this writing. Both were very hoppy, I enjoyed the Nu School better.   This is the first Southern Tier Brewery & Restaurant outside of New York."}
{"text":"Our waiter needs to C H I L L. Instead of giving us water like we had asked twice for, he kept coming up to us and asking if we wanted more beers. It got to the point where he even tapped on my almost empty glass and just stared at me. When he finally came through with the water, he gave us one glass (there were 2 of us)."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere ~ yummy beer, corn dip, and the 2x Smash burger, one of the best burgers I have eaten! Friendly staff. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"We are huge fans of southern tier beer. We explicitly drove in the cold weather just for this brewery. The tap list was amazing and if you love really flavorful beers and IPAs you're gonna love this place. The original brewery is in New York but this is a satellite brewery in Pittsburgh. They had so many beers on tap including pumking which is my favorite and also a guest tap list from victory brewing. Tons of flavorful IPAs and Imperial IPAs as well as great beers like cinnamon roll and 2xmas. I didn't try the food.  Customer service was excellent and fast.  I like the industrial new feel to the bar. The bar is a huge four sided bar that has a lot of TVs for sports viewing."}
{"text":"I'm glad I finally made it here as I am a HUGE fan of Southern Tier's beer.  I had heard from friends that the wait was typically pretty long so that discouraged me, but the lure of excellent beer overcame so off I went.  My friend and I did wait about a half hour and we were here (early) on a Saturday evening.  The bar was totally packed and it did take a little time to get a beer.  We then went and stood in the small area that is outside by the bar.  I think you can actually get wait service there.  I'll be curious as to when the outdoor seating will be started.  They won't have any problem filling the space.  Inside once we were seated for dinner we were a little bothered by fruity flies who kept buzzing around.  Since the garage door wall was open to the outside these pesky bugs made their way in.  Not terrible but not great.  For dinner, my friend and I shared two appetizers, the nachos - which were excellent, and also a quesadilla, also quite good.  But two big thumbs up for the nachos. We also each had a beer sampler.    After tasting the Nu School IPA I am hooked.  It's a good alternative to the 2X IPA because it is lighter with a lower ABV.  I just bought a 12 pack last week.    Another nice surprise was the low cost and sweet Southern Tier t-shirts.  For $15 I am the proud new owner of a pretty rad Southern Tier tie-dye.  Can't wait to come back and look forward to when the expanded outdoor area is done."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try Southern Tier, but unfortunately, the brewery opened around the time that I got pregnant. However, I was excited to make Southern Tier the first brewery that I checked out only a couple weeks post-pregnancy/delivery!   I met a couple friends at Southern Tier on a weeknight (during a Pirates game). The restaurant and bar were busy but not slammed -- the bar was busy enough that they saved me a seat but not so busy that this action made anyone upset. We all drank two of the 3 Citrus Peel Out Imperial Wheat Ale. The only beer that I had tried from Southern Tier (that I remember at least) was the famous Pumking, so I enjoyed trying something different. It was delicious and fun at 8.5% ABV, especially when you drink a couple.  I had a great experience here at Southern Tier and look forward to trying more beer and food next visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are huge food and craft beer/coctail nerds! This place has really great beer and the atmosphere is fun and very modern. The food is just okay in my opinion. Not a ton of flavor or not a huge variety when we went. Overall, I'd definitley go back and more than likely will, just not for food."}
{"text":"Great service/Busy/Awesome beer choices/good Bar food  There was a wait for a table so we ordered a beer at the bar. The place was packed on this weekend evening but we were served pretty quickly. We took our drinks to the patio outside since there was no where else to sit or stand. I hope they expand this patio and put in some benches or tables.  Once we were seated we ordered some pretzel bites with beer cheese...these were delightful. Perfect snack to go with beer. I ordered a flight because there were too many beers I wanted to taste. I didn't get to try them all so I'll have to come back for another flight. 3 citrus peel out was my favorite and I really liked the Imperial ginger.  Our waitress was genuine and very nice and took good care of us...checking in with us often even though the place was packed."}
{"text":"Meatloaf, ma! That's really all I have to say. I don't need to defend Southern Tier's beers because they are amazing and it's a well known fact. They do use this brewing facility to brew different beers and experiment with different flavors than what is brewed in New York. But, the food is what I'm really excited about. For years, the North Shore has been littered  interlopers that call themselves restaurants but they are just crappy places for people to overpay for beer and shovel nachos smothered in cheese-like goo down their throats before a game or a concert. Up until recently, I would have had to be pretty heavily influenced by an array of beer and whiskey in order to convince myself to eat anything in that general area. Luckily for all of us and our whiskey loving alter egos, positive changes have been made and hopefully more credible restaurants will continue to move in.   Southern Tier is busy all of the time, so don't expect it not to be. Even if you are sat immediately..give it time, you'll see the line form. The staff has always been really accommodating to groups and I've never had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for a beer, despite the insanity that is occurring all around. But truly, I just love their meatloaf. It's an opened-faced (not really...it is on top of a grilled cheese) with peppers and a mash up of spicy mustard, horseradish and bbq sauces. I don't think I have eaten a meatloaf within the past decade but there were too many good things on it for me not to try it out and I am glad I did. And really, the \"loaf\" is pretty tight that I would say it is more of a sausage. Ugh. I am glad I have plans to go there tomorrow because writing this is making me pretty hungry. I think this place is definitely worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a few drinks and appetizers! Loved the thin mint beer and the cheese fries! It was definitely packed but we were able to find a spot at the bar and were served quickly! We have been here a ton of times and it is still my favorite place on the North Shore"}
{"text":"I don't know what I ate. The menu said it was meatloaf, but what I got was a weirdly flavored, \"meat-thing\" with the texture of a microwavable breakfast sausage. The pulled pork was unseasoned and flavorless, and I'm about 90% certain that the \"smoked bourbon\" was just bottom shelf Jim Beam. At least the space was nice, and the beer was ok, which is the old reason it has as many stars as I've given it."}
{"text":"The staff acted like 40 to 50 year olds did not exist....   very busy stocking glasses during a busy time.  Good food...good libations... but sucky staff"}
{"text":"Ive been here twice. Both times they have messed up when we put our names in to wait for a table. When we approached the hostess they would simply say \"sorry, we can put your name back in to wait again but it will be another hour.\" Food also is nothing special. The place should stick to what they are known for and simply just sell their beer. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I've been to Southern Tier many times now and each time I've had a pleasant experience. Mainly I stop in just for drinks after work since I work downtown. It's a great new addition for after work drinks for the downtown crowd.  Admittedly, I've only gone here once for dinner and I ended up getting the nachos. I'm very picky about my nachos and I have to say these nachos don't make the cut. They definitely aren't the worst I've ever had but I definitely wouldn't get them again. They are just ok.  As for the drinks, they always have a large variety on tap. I'm not a huge beer fan and each time I've been able to find a wheat or sour beer that I enjoyed. Something that I think is very important for a brewery to do since everyone has different likes and dislikes when it comes to beer.  Lastly, we've been waiting since their opening for the outside/patio area to open up. It was under construction for a really long time and sadly it didn't open in time for the summer weather. However, I'm pleased to say it is finally open and it is covered so it can be enjoyed year round! This also opened up a lot more tables and bar seating which is nice because this place can get extremely crowded after work or before games.  All around I would definitely recommend Southern Tier. If you haven't had the chance to check it out yet, you need to get there!"}
{"text":"Service was incredible, beer was great, food was awesome, and the manager was totally cool . . . I loved my first visit here, and will be back again, hopefully many more times.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"The original Southern Tier is in my hometown, so I was delighted when they announced that they were opening a second location in Pittsburgh. First thing to know, it's quite popular so be prepared for a table wait. That being said, the staff here is awesome. They are so friendly and very helpful. When we did get seated our server was prompt and awesome. The food was delicious and I was quite pleased. I had ordered the turkey sandwich and loved it. My friends got burgers and they smelled heavenly.  We had ordered pretzel bites for the table, but they forgot to bring them out. The staff was very apologetic and they brought us an order on them. That wasn't necessary, but it was super nice of them. The manager even came over to apologize about the mix up. I love it here and will definitely be back. Make sure to try out the Pittsburgh Speed date brew. It is delicious."}
{"text":"The beer is fantastic!... the service was On Point especially with how many people were packed in there on a game day! The nachos were super yummy! If and when I come back to Pittsburgh I will visit this place again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks late Saturday night. Lots of brew options! The Chokolat stout and Blueberry tart ale were so delicious! If you like chocolate beer, I highly recommend the Chokolat with its fully and rich flavor. The atmosphere is fun and the restaurant is very open, not stuffy and cramped. Lots of seating at the bar w tables to stand as well. Interior and patio seating. We didn't try any food but looking forward to coming back, trying more brews and food!"}
{"text":"This place definitely gets crowded on Sundays during the football season but what's not to love about watching your favorite team while drinking some awesome brewskies!!  I honestly just traveled here for the booze because I was so in love with their pumking ale!  I was going to do a flight when I originally came here but as soon as I tried a sample of a cinnamon bun flavored beer I didn't want to drink anything else!  It went amazing with my burger which made my 2 hour drive so worth it!  They also have a store in the front for those of you who want to enjoy their booze in the comfort of your own home. Or you can get some souvenirs like hoodies and T-shirt's and growlers!  The service was fast and friendly!  They definitely know how to turnover tables with the blink of an eye so you don't have to wait too long to be seated.   Parking was a bit difficult and I still don't know where you're supposed to park, so I ended up parking super far and ubering to the place which stunk.  But I definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting some local delicious booze!"}
{"text":"Southern Tier Brewing is a great space -- the garage doors open up to a fabulous Biergarten, and the interior is nothing to scoff at with its view into the actual brewery and the unique light fixtures.   The menu is classic American fare, gastropub-like. There are nachos, burgers, sandwiches, some larger plates, and about three salads.   I went with my family on a nice Spring Sunday and was expecting to receive the menu that I had looked up online before making the plans. However, when we arrived we were handled a very slim \"Game Day Menu\" which only included a couple options from each section of the menu, but lacking a single salad and some of the other items that I was excited about. I asked the server if we were able to order from the rest of the menu, but we were told that since apparently it was very busy the night before, and they expected to be busy today, they decided that it was a better strategic move for the kitchen if they slimmed down the menu for today. I was not amused, simply because I did that crazy thing where I had yelped the place beforehand and already picked my entree.   I ended up ordering the veggie burger, which was just okay. The texture was very crumbly, and it reminded me of falafel. The toppings that went with it were very good, though: avocado, roasted tomatoes, greens, and a yummy sauce.   At the end of the day, Southern Tier is a fabulous space, serving great beer. The food is okay, but it would be even better if they maintained their menu for consistency."}
{"text":"Tremendous draft selection obviously but the food was excellent too which I didn't expect.  The Southern Tier burger was amazing!  To me Burgatory has the best burger in town but this was right up there with it.  This is already the top gastropub in town and will really separate itself when the outdoor section opens. Great place!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's a bad thing or a good thing that they opened so close to where I work but for the sake of a good review I'll say it's a good thing.   The brew scene is taking off in Pittsburgh and what better way to continue the trend than with Southern Tier. Hops. There's lots of hops. Hoppy Hoppy beers- But, options for those who don't want all that hop, Victory brewing is also on tap. They have a ginger-beer which boasts its ability to elevate the standard Moscow Mule to crafty Southern Tier standards, so I eagerly await the opening of the full bar. Till then, the beer will do just fine.   The atmosphere is cool industrial, yet rustic. It smells like hops but the obvious smell dissipates (at least to the back of your mind) after a few.   The nibblers are great, the almonds are just ok(but you get a ton of them), the burgers are good and the menu has something for everyone for lunch or dinner.The dishes are well thought out and pretty damn tasty. They even have staff to monitor quality to ensure that every meal that leaves the kitchen is acceptable. On top of that, the staff is nothing like the lackluster service that plagues the Northshore restaurants. They are kind and helpful and that ultimately uplifts the overall experience at Southern Tier Brewing. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excited to have STBC in this neck of the woods. My husband and I rolled up on a Tuesday night and we were able to get seated right away (The first time we attempted to visit, it was on a weekend and there was a two hour wait).   I got a few 5oz pours ($2.50 each) and wowza! I can't decide which was my favorite, as everything was so delicious. I will say that I was stoked to see two different Gose options on the drink menu. I love sours!   The food was... nothing fantastic. For appetizers we got the crispy honey chili shrimp ($11). I was under the impression this was going to be a big plate o' fried shrimp. But in reality, it was 5 jumbo shrimp on a tiny plate. Flavorful but not very \"crispy\".   I also ordered the chicken sandwich with the side salad of the day ($11). The sandwich was way too sweet: the combination of the tomato jam and the roasted red peppers was too overpowering. The side salad was just lettuce with a light drizzle of dressing. Nothing else.   My husband's fish sandwich ($12) was actually really good. The pickles, garlic aioli, and the battered fish were perfect together.   Beer = 5 stars Food = 3 stars  We'll be back for booze for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my 7th time being to the Southern Tier on the North Shore of Pittsburgh. I have been to the brewery in Lakewood, PA and had high expectations of this location. I could not be happier with the level of service and the quality of food and drinks. The staff is extremely friendly and wonderful and I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for incredible food, great atmosphere, and the best beer in Pittsburgh!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the few beers thay I had here. The food, however, was sub par. We ordered crispy cauliflower that tasted just like what you would get at a very dated bar, and it came with an aioli that had no discernable flavor besides the mayonnaise. GROSS. we also ordered nachos, and I'm a vegetarian so I requested to have the 2 meats on the side so someone else could eat it. I was then I formed that the beans they use are not vegetarian. So when the nachos came out, all that was on them was cheese, tomatoes, and sour cream. The others seemed to enjoy the pork that they had with it. But the worst part was, once we got to the center of the dish, most of the nachos were chip crumbs from the bottom of the bag. Like they didn't have enough tortilla chips, so they hid all of the crumbs underneath the toppings. We also had to flag down a person evr ry time we wanted something and it was a very slow night. Maybe 8 other people in the whole place. If like to come back for drinks, but I'll have to remember to eat first because I never want that kind of food experience again."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening and it was packed. And considering it's a large, non-carpeted space, the noise level was ridiculously loud. The beer was great, their 3 Citrus Peel Out is possibly my favorite beer now, but the food was ratchet. I ordered the Southern Tier burger, which was stuffed w beer-cheese and topped with bacon, pickle, an onion ring, garlic aoli & a little arugula- it was horrible! I'm not sure if the beer-cheese was even in it, bc there was so much aoli I had to scrape layers of it off. The actual burger was really small also, definitely not a $12 burger. My guy ordered the \"roasted\" chicken, which is in quotations bc it clearly was not roasted. It was burned on the bottom, way over cooked, and the smallest serving size I've seen in a restaurant... it actually looked more like a Cornish hen. It was weird."}
{"text":"Man did we enjoy this place. Its wonderful that southern tier is a PA based brewery but on top of the great beers they have they decided to open up a restaurant. I've always wanted to try some of the others beers they have. We tasted Live, 2X IPA, 2X Stout, pumpking and maybe one more. This place has over 20 beers to choose from including some from their sister company Victory brewing Co. Soon they will be offering spirits along with the beers.  We weren't sure which beer to start with so naturally we went with a flight. Five 5oz beers for $12.50. They give you a recommended list or you can simply pick any beer from the menu and yes i mean any. Some beers were high gravity with 10%  and 11% ABV. we ended up trying Orange Live, Mookah, Warlock, Speed Date and coffee pumpking. My fave was definitely Mookah for its sweet taste. it was almost like drinking a chocolate milkshake beer. I wasn't too fond of the coffee pumpking as I assumed it would be sweeter but it was too bitter for my taste.  For dinner we started out with some smoked wings as recommended by a fellow yelper. Our sauces included blue cheese, ranch, mild and BBQ sauce. I played around with the flavors dipping two sauces on one wing but in the end the wings were delicious in and of themselves. Crispy smokey out side and tender juicy chicken on the inside, just how I like my wings. Our entrees were recommended by my good friend Malik who suggested the meatloaf and chimichurri blue cheese steak. Both were amazing but i really enjoyed the meatloaf a lot more. The meatloaf was a grilled cheese sandwich on texas toast topped with meatloaf, sautéed peppers and onions and BBQ sauce. it was one of those meals that makes you happy your alive. *High five to the chef.* Our steak was prepared medium and was cooked perfectly. Arrived hot and juicy, perfectly tender and dripping in chimichurri goodness! We both opted for greens over fries even though the steak still came with the fries which btw were excellent as well.  I don't come to the north shore for any other reason than the 4th of July and the occasional Pirates game but i have a good reason to go down there now. Plus parking is free after 6pm. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Went to watch the Stanley Cup final. This is a very nice place. The food was great and the beer was awesome. Very reasonably priced. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The interior had a really cool vibe, the beer was good, but the food was a total miss. Drink here, eat somewhere else. Our kids were champs waiting over an hour for food (we happened to show up the day after the patio opened and wait times for food were so long.) When the place is near max capacity it is LOUD. People talking plus music equals a lot of noise.  My blindingly hot-just-fried fish sandwich could have used more garlic aioli, but the pickle slices were a nice touch. (Just make tartar sauce?) Southern Tier burger had a promising collection of ingredients, but missed in flavor. Te kids meals were generous in size, however, the kids did not enjoy the fries at all. Most of our table agreed the fries tasted reheated/or warmed under a heat lamp which made no sense for the volume of people they were serving that day. They tasted even worse reheated as leftovers the next day.  The restrooms were very bright and clean, but could do with larger towel holders or more. There's also an additional family restroom available which was a nice touch with many families there dining.  Plenty of other options to spend your money at on food, but if you need a beer it's a fairly good choice."}
{"text":"Southern Tier is actually a nice addition to the North Shore. The corporate craft brewery is a very different experience than a local craft brewery. It's big and more fancy but once you get past the pretty light fixtures and nice industrial space, it definitely feels more like a chain restaurant with a lot of beers on tap and communal tables.   We braved the crowds in their opening days where the bar was 4 deep to order a beer before standing around waiting for a table. They text you when your table is ready. Clearly we weren't getting seats at the bar, so that eliminates sampling to help you find a beer you like. We each ordered their IPA and it was a 4 star beer. I got a 2nd beer later with my food that wasn't as successful. The Tangier Session IPA was watery and pretty much lacking in every regard.   Once seated I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with tomato jam, roasted red peppers & gruyere with a side salad - the sandwich was excessively sweet with a lot of bread and the salad consisted of greens out of a bag drowned in sweet & sour vinaigrette. My husband got The Southern Tier Burger & side salad. He was informed they 'Smash Grill' all their burgers on a flat top griddle & they are all cooked the same - well done. He still decided to order it and the ingredient flavors were good but the meat was dry & overcooked.   Service was actually good considering how busy everyone was. Overall I'm voting this place pretty average."}
{"text":"I know this place is more about the beer but I ate possibly the best Reuben I've ever had. Mokah beer was very good. The wait for a table was a bit much (hour and a half) but it's a new place and small so I guess that's to be expected."}
{"text":"The food seems pretty decent if you are in the mood for slightly elevated bar fare. The beer is okay, I used to be a bigger fan a few years ago, but have since found other tastier brands. The service was good. Just a bit too commercial for my liking. Decent for bro hangout after a bike ride or something. That's about it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Wait-staff is lovely and knowledgeable and goes far above and beyond what a lot of places would consider good service. Boyfriend and I got beer flights, and our server Malik's suggestions were excellent, and thanks to them we both have a new favorite to get when we come back! Southern tier burger is also exactly as good as it sounds. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Should be 5 but when i walked in i was greeted by some snotnose stuck up kid named CORY. He talked to me like hes better than i am and should be lucky my blue collar plain old comman man was allowed to be graced with his presence. Luckily the wait staff, food, and amazing atmosphere made up for dealing with CORY. Not sure why anyone would have him as the forst person you come in contact with at the door. Just puts a sour taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"It's sad, when this place first opened it was so good. The standard has obviously dropped. The pretzel appetizer changed and now it's large and under cooked. Our server checked on everyone around us, except us, and the meals were equally as bad. I ordered the Roasted Chicken plate entree and the chicken was incredibly dry on the inside and smothered with sausage grease on the outside. My boyfriend ordered the Southern Tier Burger and it came out with just a burger bacon and a bun with a side of fries, it looked pathetic. This burger has 6+ ingredients listed and it was an over cooked hockey puck. Then it took our server about 10 minutes to even come check on us before we could tell him it was not made correctly. It seemed like the food had been sitting in the window for a while which could be why my chicken was terrible. Once he did ask how the food was he took it back to the kitchen and we waited for a new burger, which was nice. Then the fella who brought out the second burger said he would take care of it for us. Well when we got the check he never \"took care of it.\" That's fine, but don't say your going to take an item off the check and not take it off. After getting the bill I told our server what the other guy had said and he took it off, and I appreciate that. I'm not going to give the server the benefit of the doubt though, he had 3 other tables. He wasn't overwhelmingly busy, there's no reason we didn't get an equal amount of attention as all the other tables. The overall experience was just a bummer because it USED to be so good. Will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"We were there during the Penguins outdoor game last weekend.  The place was very crowded when we first got there, but once the game started it did clear out some.  The food was amazing, I got a sandwich and chips since they ran out of fries.  Still amazing!  I drank the 2 Milk Stout all night, it has always been a favorite!  Can't wait to go back and try some others! You should do the same!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here. Even when it's packed you do not need to wait very long for service. Even though they obviously specialize in beer, one time I had two of their martinis and they were very yummy! We shared some appetizers and they all were pretty good and shareable for our group."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night for a drink and a bite to eat before going to a show at Stage AE (a stone's throw away). We were a group of six, so it was important to get a reservation!  The place is fairly large, and is set up in a modern, warehouse type style with lots of hip light fixtures and high tables.   I stuck with the Southern Tier IPA and a chicken sandwich with fries (100% recommend). My friends tried a few other beers while we were there. I recommend getting a flight to try multiple if you have the time!  My friend got the veggie burger and said it was hands down the BEST one she has ever had. I didn't get to try it, but it looked huge and delicious - plus it didn't fall apart with each bite.   All in all, great experience, I would go back again!"}
{"text":"This is my brother's go-to spot in Pittsburgh. I, however, was not as impressed. We went right before a Pirates game, so the place was packed. We were told that our wait was going to be an hour, which we said was fine. We were able to find one seat at the bar, so one of us sat and four of us stood around waiting for our table. The weather was really bad and it seemed people were taking shelter in the bar area.   Once we were seated, our waitress took a very long time to come over to our table. She asked if we wanted food and I ordered for myself and she proceeded to walk away without asking if anyone else wanted anything. After about 10 minutes we were finally able to get her attention and order for the rest of the table.   Food review: Pretzel was pretty standard for a pub pretzel. The cauliflower salad was delicious. Perfect dressing and the cauliflower cream was amazing. Very good salad overall.   Even though my dining experience left something to be desired, it seems like it may be a fun after work spot. I will have to try this place again under different circumstances."}
{"text":"First time at Southern Tier and I was so impressed! I tried the Cherry Gose and it was tart and delicious. This is a great spot to take a group and try a flight of different beers. Being on the North Shore, lots of other options are around - but this is my new favorite. We also tried a variety of the food - all were excellent and everyone enjoyed everything we ordered. This is a very casual atmosphere with high top tables and although they don't have happy hour specials, that is the kind of vibe this place gives off. I've also seen it crazy packed before games. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my dad and uncle and little cousin  while on a trip to Pittsburgh to catch a steeler game. Holy god, was the food not only delicious but also addicting. There honey shrimp I couldn't get enough of and their caramel beer is one of the best beverages you will ever down. Our waiter was more like a friend to us made the greatest recommendations on everything and was one of the nicest down to earth men you'll ever meet. Service here is the best I've ever experienced anywhere at any business. Wish this place was in California!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable addition to the area, beers are consistently amazing and the menu pairs really well. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, beer, atmosphere, and service! We will most definitely be back!  Chocolate mint was the perfect desert beer.  Pork sandwich was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Yay... so excited that Southern Tier finally opened!! I had been anxiously awaiting ever since they broke ground back in August and so when I saw a post that they were open to the public, I had to go for the first night.   It was crowded, there were no seats at the bar and so my husband and I got a table. Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. He asked us what kinds of beer we like and gave recommendations based on that. We got a flight of 5 to sample, two IPA's for him, a stout and a pumpkin beer for me, and a curveball 12% beer. They all were very flavorful, my favorite was the 2X Stout. Also, I probably wouldn't order a full glass of that 12% one. We then both ordered full size beers based on what we liked.  My only complaint would be accuracy. One of the beers in the flight wasn't what we ordered, and we put in an appetizer initially and it never came but by the time we noticed, we were fine with just the beers. I'm sure the kinks will be worked out since it was only opening night. Great job Southern Tier!"}
{"text":"Wonderful beers and delicious food, but one warning - don't try the fish sandwich. Battered, then breaded, the fish was completely separated from the coating that was melted into the bun.   The beers were phenomenal, and we enjoyed our flights. Service was good on a busy Saturday. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Went for the family and friend event, the pre-opening. Amazing. First, the inside is warm and inviting, lots of wood and I loved the lighting-loved the fixtures! Greeted by amazingly friendly staff and we were seated promptly. Greeted by our waitress who was phenomenal the entire time we were there. Had an app, the seasoned almonds which were nicely roasted with a nice and sweet coating on them. We got a beer flight which included 5 of their beers. The hubby loves the warlock. I liked the orange and the cold pressed coffee pumpking-wow! And I am not necessarily a beer drinker. For our entrees the hubby got the club sandwich minus avocado and cheese. He got fries. He said the bacon was especially good. I chose the roasted chicken which came with a potato hash on a butternut squash puree. The chicken was tender and paired with the potato hash and the sweetness of the butternut squash puree, a symphony of flavors meshing well together. Light and delightful. For dessert, a chocolate cake that was rich and decadent, great for sharing with a sidecar of the choklat beer, another of the hubby's favorites. I see this place doing extraordinarily well. Staff was awesome, food was great, and beer was fantastic!!! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Southern Tier Brewing in Pittsburgh. The servers, bartenders, and host/hostesses are friendly and kind. They have a fantastic selection of beer with something for everyone. The food is great too!"}
{"text":"I really, really like what they've done here. I've always liked a lot of ST beers- and now there is this great bar to hang at in an awesome location.  We have been down a few times and tried a variety of foods and beers. My favorites have been the wings and the pretzel bites. Pro tip: you can ask for beer cheese instead or in addition to the mustard that comes with the pretzels!  The weather hasn't been good enough for us to enjoy the bier garten just yet- but it looks like it will be a nice time with ample seating.   The kitchen is semi open if you'd prefer to watch that magic, but there is a lot going on all over the establishment.  The staff has always been pretty friendly and welcoming- we have been there when it was slow and also on a Saturday game night- and they've been consistent."}
{"text":"For vegetarians/vegans this isn't a great spot. The crispy parmesan cauliflower is fried in oil that everything is fried in. So their fries are also not vegetarian by this reason. They also don't have anything on their menu that specifies what is made without animal products/ doesn't come in contact with them. The atmosphere is a basic bar feel. It's not very nice it's just mediocre."}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit, and this is the first beer spot we hit in PGH.   I enjoyed this place a lot. I had the Victory Sour Monkey and the Southern Tier Thick Mint. Both were great, the Sour Monkey was one of my favorite sours I've had.   The atmosphere on a Friday night was great minus a couple loud middle aged women, but at least they seemed like they were having a good time.   I didn't try enough to write a huge review, but the first impression was good enough that I'll come back to try it again."}
{"text":"Great spot near the stadiums, always busy!! Will be even better when the outdoor area is opened as well. Beer is good, very knowledgable, always helps you choose the right drink. Always good food, the nachos are great!!"}
{"text":"I had stopped here once during the spring before a pirates game and it was so packed you couldn't move. I was so excited that this time we got right in and got seats at the bar! My sister and I are not beer drinker by any means but wanted to check it out. After a few minutes of looking over the drink menu we asked the bartender for help being that we had no idea what the difference was between an IPA or Budlight, ha! He walked us through different beers and recommended a few that we may like. For $12.50 you can get a flight of 5 oz beers which is perfect for people like me who have no idea about craft beer! We split a flight and it turns out my sister likes darker beers and I like more floral tasting ones! The inside was beautiful and the staff was very helpful to us! There is a large patio that is enclosed in the winter and open during the summer, I would definitely return to check out that area again!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the food. Had previously tried their beers and thought I knew what to expect. Beer selection was larger than anticipated and even included some guest beers from other craft breweries. Bar also serves wine and liquor.  Food was priced below average for the location. I anticipated higher prices with the proximity to PNC Park and Heinz Field.  Be aware that the crowd is large before Pirates games and tables can be hard to get as fans linger until game time."}
{"text":"This was the highlight of my evening. Southern Tier Brewing Company knows how to entertain. Drinks for two were very reasonably priced at $6/12oz. I ordered the Cinnamon Roll and Salted Caramel and thoroughly enjoyed both. The decor is beautiful inside, there are plenty of things for everyone from the gift shop to the bar to the large screen TVs on the wall. Great date spot, will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I waited to write a review of this place until I had more food. So, here we go:  1. The beer selection is pretty darn good and we need more breweries in da burgh'. (Another brew pub is coming to the north side soon...so wahoo for that!) Finally had their signature \"pumking\" and was definitely pleased and delighted! I never get sick of pumpkin. I've also had their old fashioned and the NU Skool IPA. Both good choices, though I've finally made up my mind to not jump on the IPA band wagon. Just not my taste.  2. Their apps are good! Came here once with coworkers and ordered just about every single one and none were disappointing.  3. Ordered a chicken sandwich on Friday evening and OH MY GOSH it was chewier than a stick of gum. I couldn't even finish it. I ended up eating the remainder of the bread with the grilled veggies. It was too busy to send it back and I was too hungry to care. But, buyer beware. No chickie sandwiches are recommended!!!   I'll be back for drinks and apps and that shall be all."}
{"text":"On a balmy Tuesday evening, my wife and I and our dog Sidda enjoyed our 1st visit to the outdoor seating area.  Our waiter Seamus..you know who you are...a SanFrancisco transplant was a true gem!  He was on the ball, funny, and a lot of fun to have as our waiter. The beer is always good as are the burgers.  It was Seamus who made our night out really fun!  Thanks Seamus!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food for what I was thinking was just a brewery. If you get a chance I would urge you to visit Southern Tier. The food prices were reasonable and the drinks were great too. Lots of choices available for adult beverages and great comfort food menu."}
{"text":"We hit this place twice while in Pittsburgh. Great food and beer. Good ambiance and nice place to meet pre- Steelers game. We sampled a number of items and it was all good."}
{"text":"Southern Tier Brewing opened this location near PNC Park and Heinz Field this summer.  I have been to their Lakewood NY location, but this was my first visit to the new place by the stadiums.  Southern Tier is a super place to visit, before or after taking in an athletic event or just stop by for good food an brew. There is a convienent \"T\" stop not to far away, but even if you walk across the bridge it isn't a bad walk.  The day of my visit was a rare 4pm Pirates game, and we arrived so early that only the bar was full.  Our party of 6 were seated and our waiter Bradshaw could not have been more helpful and pleasant.  Bradshaw was very patient with me in advising on my beer selection and brought two tastes before settling on my pour.  Attention to our table's service did not falter as the place filled before the game.  All in our group were very pleased with our meals of:  Winter Salad, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Broccoli Cheese Soup, Burger, Parmesean Garlic Cauliflower.  Southern Tier didn't cheap out on the flatware, plates, glasses, decor or anything about this location.  The outdoor patio is still under construction but will certainly be grade -A just like the inside brewery.  The ceiling is high but the noise level was very good.  Music was not blaring and we could all hear one another well.  I don't know how they did this with full capacity of patrons but whatever it is - it is working."}
{"text":"This is strictly my point of view because I know a lot of my friends LOVE this place, so I find myself there frequently. The place is beautiful and their new extension is lovely. I can't wait to spend the summer in their outdoor area! The food is also amazing, particularly their smoked wings. We have ordered them every time we have gone there! Aside from that, their hanger steak is amazing and a great portion. It comes with fries and a salad, which is great to order even alone! I have tried it twice. I made the mistake of ordering it medium-well the last time and it was a bit undercooked for my liking, but my husband helped me finish the undercooked pieces. I give three stars because personally, I don't enjoy many of their beers. I have been there around 10 times and just this past time did I FINALLY find a drink I enjoyed... their Extra Dark and Stormy! I had tried their vodka previously and couldn't finish it. The majority of their beers are too dark of hoppy for me. But thankfully, I now have my drink choice for when I go back. Service is always quick and friendly. Thanks :)"}
{"text":"Good service and good beers.  The bang bang like shrimp and smoked wings are yummmm!  We'll be back maybe back to back like the clever 2XCUP employee T shirts."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer. The place is clean and on the darker side. Well decorated. The service was good. The beer was good. I feel like every brewery is on the same decor scheme. Nothing stands out anymore. Same for the beer. Someone has to have something out of this work for me to say 'wow, that was fantastic, this is all I want to drink.'   Would we return, sure. I always recommend you try a new to you place. This could be your favorite one yet!"}
{"text":"This place is easily my new favorite bar in Pittsburgh. The vibe is super chill and the beer selection is awesome. For a Southern Tier fan especially this place is the best. It looks like they may expand to have an outdoor area which would be sweet too."}
{"text":"Let's be honest...if you go to STBC, you're going for the beer not necessarily the food. And go for the beer you should! They carry all the fan favorites including a few seasonals and sours. With all the beer consumption, naturally you wanna git you some grub...just don't set expectations too high. The smoked wings (tossed in brown sugar BBQ sauce) were a welcome change, but the roasted corn dip fell short. Also, they're not considered appetizers if they come out the same time as the rest of your food. Boo! Moving on to mains...the smoked pulled pork sandwich had potential, but it was dry and the apple based slaw on top didn't help it at all. The fish sammie was decent, but the size of the fish was rather small. Despite the appetizer snafu, service was solid considering the amount of customers and that they had just opened the prior week. A great addition to the North Shore."}
{"text":"Beautiful space and cool concept. If you haven't been  exposed to the beers before this place would definitely enjoy coming here. Staff was very nice, didn't have a very long wait for anything at all. Beer was tasty and cold. Food was only average to me. Had the club sandwich and it was a good portion size. The fries i had were all cold and just small burnt pieces. The pastrami Reuben looked tons better than it was. The krauft was really sweet and took away from the taste. Since I already know all the beers they make chances are the food isn't going to draw me back in there."}
{"text":"We've been anticipating Southern Tier to open for some time now and we're very happy it did! We got there around 11:30 and it wasn't too busy (we got there just in time. It has a really cool feeling when you walk in, there's a bar to your right and a lot of seating. You can see where they brew some of the beer and there's a window into the kitchen. Everything was very clean, as expected since it's only been open a week. Our waiter was very nice and super knowledgeable about the beers they have and beer in general.  I had: the Fish and Chip sandwich with fries. Everything was delicious! The garlic aioli really topped it off! I only wish that the piece of fish would've been bigger, but we were there for lunch so it wasn't a huge deal. The fries were very well seasoned and delicious as well. I also had a Victory Sour Monkey beer which was extremely good!  He had: the Pastrami Reuben with fries. In his words... \"it was awesome\" He went with a Nu Skool brew as recommended by the waiter and he was a big fan.   All in all everything was great and we look forward to coming back many times over!"}
{"text":"We've traveled thousands of miles on a recent road trip- trying restaurant breweries along the way. This place is MY FAVORITE and gets five stars for beer, food, service, ambience - truly awesome all the way. Do a flight and find your favorite ."}
{"text":"The two beers that we had here were tasty but the food left much to be desired.  I had the Thick Mint.  It surprisingly had a thin mint cookie finish.  She had the Golden Ale and said it was just OK.  4/5 stars on the beers.  We started with the regular nachos which were very large.  Pulled pork, cream cheese, guacamole, refried beans, green onions and beer cheese.  It would have been nice for more of a melted cheddar all over them.  3/5  She had the Fish and Chips which is a beer battered chunk of cod on a bun with fries or chips.  The sandwich was excellent she said but the chips seemed to be just sitting under a heat lamp.  Before she finished her sandwich they were cold, bland, and tasted like reheated fries.  We don't think that they made these fresh to order.  4/5  I had the Turkey Club sandwich with fries.  The fries were good but the sandwich was not very good.  It was chipped turkey meat made into a ball with two strips of bacon, mayo, lettuce and tomato.  The meat was so dry the only thing that saved it was the amount of mayonnaise that they put onto it.  I ate the turkey out of the sandwich and had 3/4\" of a crust left.  2/5  Total bill was $45."}
{"text":"Southern Tier does no wrong. This great brew pub is the first result of their partnership with Victory. Good food and amazing beer. Stop in for their regular lineup or to try one of the new beers brewed in Pittsburgh and only available there."}
