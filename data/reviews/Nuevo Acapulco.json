{"text":"They have really good Mexican food. The table side guacamole is very good. The lunch special food is very good and nice sized portions."}
{"text":"This is the place that doesn't look impressive from the outside (it shares a parking lot with a cheap motel) but has had so much success simply because of their phenomenal Mexican dishes! Word of mouth works! 
They have my favorite salsa, period. I tend to get stuck on ordering the same dishes over and over again, but I can't help it! I'm also picky about guacamole, and there's is a win. There's a good reason you'll wait at least 30 minutes on a weekend to eat here!  The gentleman that are the owners are friendly, much of their staff has been there awhile, which means something to me.  The inside is kind of dark, sometimes looks a little drab and dirty. But the chatter of a packed establishment draws your attention away from that. Bottom line, you're there for the food."}
{"text":"I have been going to nuevo for many many years....
Always great service....
Food comes out very very quickly, so if you like to have a full drink before your meal, hold off on the order and enjoy the chips and salsa or table side quacamole, its amazing!!!!
The margs are very very good, haven't really had one that good locally to be honest, I suggest asking for a \"Cadillac \".
Food is plentiful and always on point....very flavorful and many options.
They just re did the bar!!!!!
Amazing."}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderful experience at this fairly new Mexican restaurant!  We were highly impressed with the very tasty homemade salsa and loved the chips.  Those who got margaritas enjoyed them and all of our meals were perfect!  I got the seafood burrito with rice and beans - so yummy!  We will definitely be going back to this nice restaurant!  The food, atmosphere and service were all wonderful!"}
{"text":"After being seated the chips and salsa were brought to the table quickly, but that is where the service stopped. The waiter arrived about 15-20 minutes after to take our drink order, and it did not get better from there. The same waiter had the tables around us, and it looked as if they received prompt service, yet we did not. The salsa was very watery and bland. My order was delivered to me cold (enchiladas as far as I know are not served cold), but I am not sure that it actually left the kitchen that way, as I had to ask for silverware 2 times from the server who finally brought it on the 3rd request, but based on the filling of them being cold and lack of the melt on the cheese on them, I am going to assume that it did in fact leave the kitchen in that condition and may have actually warmed up sitting on my table for me to eat. The \"red sauce\" tasted very much \"out of the can\" like you would pick up in a grocery store, and the meat had an additional seasoning on it that does not compliment the sauce at all. For a table of 4 and a bill of $61 is not out of line, if the food is decent and the service is up to standard, but they met none of these with either the food or service. If your thinking about going here, hit up the Speedway gas station across the street, and grab a microwaveable burrito cook it for 1/2 the recommended time, then ask the clerk to ignore you for 10-15 minutes before you pay for it and you will have the exact same experience and save yourself about $50 on dinner for 4."}
{"text":"By far, hands down, the best Mexican restaurant in cleveland, in Ohio, and possibly in the Midwest!  Everyone is great there, the food is the best, the owner actually talks to customers, and is friendly.  I go there quite often, (at least a few times a month, for many years), and I have never had a bad experience.  The decor is very nice, and I can't think of a single bad thing about the place!  I usually get the chicken fajitas, but honestly, you can't go wrong with any item on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican Restaurant in the Akron area - definitely worth the drive if you are farther away.  The salsa is so good - nicely marinated to get the best flavor.  The table side guacamole is a must!  Be sure to request Jorge!  The food is top quality and the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated.  I have been here about 8 times!  Not returning to any of the other area Mexican restaurants.  This is the absolute best!"}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for good Mexican food we spotted Nuevo Acapulco while spinning around the circle in Tallmadge, We finally stopped in today and found the name has changed to El Tren, although I was informed it is run by the \"same people\" and the \"menu is the same\".

The guacamole prepared table side is worth the price of admission. Prepared fresh with to your preference, best gauc around! The chips we so so, but the guacamole made them better than they'd be with just salsa.

The salsa is not so good, watery and loaded with chilli powder giving it a dull flavor. The ingredients looked good, the recipe needs work. 

My entree was the #8, an enchilada, I chose a beef enchilada and a chile rellano, it  was served with rice and refried beans.

The meal was served quickly and hot, covered in melted cheddar/jack cheese. Generally it was good. The chile rellano was limp, but it was \"traditional-ish.\" The pepper was small, more like an anaheim instead of a poblano, but still it was good. Much better than the puddle of goo served in other Mexican establishments.

The enchilada was filled with ground beef and was well seasoned. The red sauce was flavorful. 

The beans and rice were the usual fare, both were good.

The entire entree was somewhat greasy, which I attributed to all of the melted cheese. Overall the restaurant was clean, and the service was very good. The prices reasonable and portions large.

A good Mexican choice, not our first choice, but good enough to come back and try some other menu choices."}
{"text":"It used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in Cleveland ! It used to stand out and taste much better then the other Mexican restaurants with the same numbered menus and bland taste. Sadly, the quality, taste, and execution has changed in a bad way. 

I started going here about 11 years ago for a work party, and I have been going there since, on a fairly regular basis. My last four experiences have been very disappointing. The execution and taste were simply bad. The food is either cold or tastes bland, the fajitas are burned, the chicken is full of water , beans are dry and the lettuce is old. 

Besides the food, service has been on a decline as well. I am from Europe and English is my third language. With that said, I have received the wrong dish numerous times simply because the waiter or waitress did not speak English !!!!! Please have employees speak English when they take food orders come mostly from English speaking customers.

I hope it turns around and the food gets to taste fresh again."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! Make sure you get some table side guacamole!  Eating it as I type.

I'm a big fan of all the burritos
..so try em becuas3 this review says so!"}
{"text":"Was very impressed as soon as we got in the door the staff was very nice and got us seated quickly. The salsa isna very unique style compared to the norm that you would find in the area but was really good we went thru several dishes very fresh and great flavor. The menu was just as impressive many dishes I had not even heard of truly a laege menu with a diverse variety to please even the pickiest eaters. 

Once the food arrived it was well plated very nicely (added a photo to the pictures the tacos) and the flavors were amazing. The entire table was very impressed the steak was very tender and juicy in every bite. 

The service was great our server was Daryl and the front of the house staff was also very nice and attentive. This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in the area! Very highly recommended to everyone!

Also, the murals and art work are amazing make sure to check them out!"}
{"text":"I liked this place ten years ago, but it seems to have gone downhill. The host was nice; otherwise, really surly service. We were seated in an empty back area facing their high chair storage. Even though the place was more than half-empty, servers kept rushing us to order--coming over three times in five minutes and looking angry when we said weren't ready yet. The servers also weren't nice at all to the kids, who were well-behaved (there were six of us--three adults and three kids). Some of the chips were chewy, not crispy, as if they had been undercooked. Steak tacos were just bits of steak thrown into a weirdly tough and chewy tortilla, as if it had come right out of the freezer. Seems like they're not even trying."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I've been a loyal Nuevo customer for a very long time. I have always raved about the food and service here. We visit and get takeout frequently, but haven't been there in 2 months until tonight. 

Is it under new management? This is the only explanation I had. My husband and I just had dinner there tonight and I was completely turned off. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and trio fajitas to share.

The chicken in the quesadilla was half whole breast pieces and half shredded - all situated in the middle of the tortilla only, so it was impossible to bite without it making a mess, not to mention the green chile inside ended up all over the place. The tortilla wasn't even warm. It was disgusting.

The meat in our fajitas was completely covered in raw vegetables - a ton of tomatoes (which never come in fajitas here?) and uncooked green peppers and onions - since when are fajita vegetables raw? Our rice was over cooked and glopped together. To top it off, our waters were warm and had no ice.

I came home feeling fairly gross and unsatisfied, considering I could only get down 1 small piece of quesadilla and one soft taco. Sincerely hope this was just a fluke as I'd be fairly disappointed if this became the norm for a restaurant that's always been great."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant in Ohio. Although I live in Boston, now, each time I go back, I try to make it a point to go to Nuevo. LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Most authentic Mexican food around.
Their chips, salsa, guacamole and sharing a Mexican pizza and frozen margaritas are a great girls night out."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Food came amazingly fast.  I had chicken enchiladas suiza....EXCELLENT!   I have to say this is the best Mexican food I've had since moving back here from Arizona."}
{"text":"Love the table side guac. Get it every time! Fajitas are best shared by 2. Never a disappointment coming here. Oh and cant forget Mango margarita, delish to."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic I would highly recommend making a trip to come here.The food was not rushed out and the table side guacamole was excellent and the staff was very polite."}
{"text":"I should have known that this place was going to be horrible when I tried the salsa.  It's hard to really mess up salsa- like totally ruin it.  Sometimes it's bland or too spicy or too this or that.  This salsa was HORRIBLE!  You know the salsa that comes in a jar on the chip aisle?  That is far superior salsa.  There is no excuse for the salsa at this place.  I'll move on to the rest of the food.

I will say that the guacamole was ok.  The taco was not fabulous although the meat was plentiful.  The enchilada was no good.  Neither was the rice.  

The server we had was really sweet and on top of things and everyone was nice.  Just not the food."}
{"text":"Table side Guac is delicious, fajitas are great.  Price is a little higher than a typical Mexican Restaurant, but the food is well worth it.  Staff was very helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"Excellent table side guacamole, top shelf margaritas, hacienda burrito and carnes asada. The quality of the food is amazing and the service is spectacular. I've been there at lunch time, dinner time, during the week and on the weekends. Every time it was the same ... Fantastic."}
{"text":"This was our first and last time here. The food was gross we ate one bite of it all four of of us and when the server finally came back he asked if we wanted boxes we said no he took the plates and brought us the bill we then had to tell him we didn't like the food and wanted to talk to a manager he said I figured and instead of a manager coming he comes back and said the best we can do is take half off. Half off and we ate nothing and no Manger place sucks server sucked all around bad . I only gave a star because I had to."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican you will find in the Cleveland area. The place was busy but seating wasn't a problem. Large portions. Many menu items. The chips and salsa are wonderful. The combination plates are standard and are prepared well. The other menu items I have tried have never disappointed either.

The place has a nice feel to it and the food is great... What more do you want? :)"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. If you like guacamole, the tableside guac is the best around."}
{"text":"I was just at this restaurant two days ago. I was given my bill, and then I gave the waitress my credit card. She comes back to the table 10 minutes
later with 2 receipts! She used my card to pay for the wrong table, then used my card again for my transaction as well, post voiding the old one. No explanation as to how or why this was messed up, she sent me on my my way. My 8 dollar taco salad at this point has now cost me 70 dollars. I'm pretty upset with this."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! My co workers and I go every week! Amazing food, the staff is WONDERFUL & we enjoy ourselves every time we go!"}
{"text":"Use to be our favorite Mexican place, not only more. This time we had to wait awhile before the server showed up. Not busy at all that night. Took our order and never saw him again. Had to request a box and the bill from another server. Still nothing. Went to the cashier and told her the food was lousy this time and the server was MIA. Won't be back and won't recommend to anyone. Should have just gone down the street to Taco Bell. Dog didn't even like the left overs."}
{"text":"Recently visited the restaurant was a little scared at first since it was right next to a motel! But once I got inside the decor was cool with all the paintings and things..

When I was going over the menu I noticed a lot of the dishes weren't so authentic using a lot of veggies like mushrooms and carrots in the dishes so I was really unsure of what to get so I ordered shrimp fajitas.. 

Now I know it sounds stupid to say the shrimp tasted a little fishy but it did and it shouldn't have ! The portion of the food was great but I was put off by the carrots and other random veggies in the meal..

I do have to say I loved the salsa I love chunks of tomatoe and onion in my salsa same with the guacamole it was great! Also appreciated they brought a thing filled with tortillas rather then just hand me 3 

Overall the place was ok a little over priced I think I will stick to my fiesta jalepenos in medina !"}
{"text":"This may be the best Mexican restaurant I have ever eaten at in my life - and I have been in S. America at least 6 times. My wife agreed. Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"Overall is good. The only thing I would have to criticize is that most of their options taste the same. I do have to say that their portions are pretty good in size but they kind of overload on lettuce and stuff."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and great food. Not like those other Mexican restaurants that are more like fast food. Here they cook your food to order and there is nothing on the menu I haven't tried that I didn't like so for. 2 thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"This is our go to Mexican date night restaurant. It's some of the best authentic Mexican food in the area. Portions are huge, the margaritas are good & strong, & you can't beat the service. We used to go about once a week & while they do get busy on weekends, you can always mosey on over to the bar to grab a margarita & some chips & salsa while you wait for a table. Now that our family has grown, we typically do take out. Normally our food is ready in about 15 minutes & the quality is always wonderful!"}
{"text":"My wife and I lived in Texas for years and had struggled to find a Mexican restaurant in the Akron area up to Texas standards. Nuevo Acapulco has solved our problem. The food is great, the prices good, and the service excellent. This would rank among the best Mexican restaurants in Austin, TX, which is saying a lot. It keeps an authentic Mexican flavor that a lot of the over-Americanized Akron-area Mexican restaurants lack. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here off & on for years. Not a fan of their \"tomato juice salsa\". Their queso is good. I like the macho burrito a lot. Sometimes the beans & rice are real good other times just OK. They were better years ago. Enchiladas & Chili rellenos are good. I come early so service has never been a problem with me. Decent Mex food at reasonable prices. Hey, the 80's Luchita is long gone brother , ya gotta make due with what u got!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. The food is generally good, but recently has been so inconsistent. We ordered guacamole for the chips that came out with our dinner. I ordered a combo with a taco, enchilada and tamale. There was no meat (none) in my taco. The server also forgot the beans. Service is satisfactory. Our waters were empty until we asked for them to be filled. The WORST part about this experience is that it smelled like urine in the restaurant, except for the bar area. It was horrible. Shame on me, it has smelled like urine 3 of the last 5 times we have dined in. We should have known better. I think so we can go back after so many failed chances."}
{"text":"what a dump...but it was voted Best in The West by Cleveland Magazine so we went to try it...well we have had better. Ordered the Macho Burrito w/picadillo (pulled pork) and the Relleno Burrito. Both were satisfactory but no need to EVER return there. The salsa was yucky too...."}
{"text":"Having lived in Texas and traveled the Southwestern US, their Acapulco Nachos are the best I have ever had....Awesome"}
{"text":"We have gone here many times before, but it has been a few years since our last trip. It definitely wasn't what I remember. I make my own salsa when I can. This salsa had WAY too much onion. It had a lot of white onion, and then a green onion also. It was over powering. It also seemed like it was made with tomato sauce, not fresh chopped tomatoes. My fajitas were just average. Margaritas were good.  But, what a shame. This restaurant was once one of the best in the Cleveland area. So disappointed."}
{"text":"First, not real Mexican food
Second, even for TexMex this is very bad quality food, horrible preparation 
Third, bad service. 
'Nough said."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and good service.  Great iced tea (strong) and food is always hot."}
{"text":"Love this place! The servers are very friendly! I'm there once a week. The owners are there working and greeting customers. I love the rice and beef dish. Yum!"}
{"text":"What a bummer.  I was really hoping for a lot more when I read all the reviews.  It was average food in a faux Mexican setting, with over the top paintings and colors.  I had chimichangas as I seem to always do, but was not impressed by the frying, as they were oily and soggy instead of crispy and delicious.  The dessert at Mexican restaurants is what I normally look forward to, and it failed as well.  The fried ice cream actually went unfinished which is unheard of with me.  Its not bad food, but you have way better options cleveland!"}
{"text":"I have been there many many times.
Good, tasty and fresh food every time.
Their green salsa is amazing.  I have tried almost all of their veg items. And we have always liked the food. The beans the fajitas the various sauces they have.....all taste fantastic.  
Portions are huge. I can almost eat 2 meals from one.
Service is also very good and prompt.  Friendly and professional.  Always get greeted upon entry as well as while leaving. The servers check on you every so often.....refill ur water etc.,..
The restaurant is big. They have a lot of seating. I have always found it clean. They are able to accommodate table/booth requests.
Weekends get busy there.....so there maybe a little wait. 
All said - this is one of my favorite places to go for Mexican food. I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food North of the Rio Grande.  Macho burrito, Chile reyno, tacos El Carbone are all excellent. The Cadillac Margaritas are to die for."}
{"text":"We went for the first time the other day from the recommendations of friends. First impressions wasn't too great to be honest. They had a bunch of unbussed tables which is one of my biggest pet peeves. It got better though..... Lol
Our waitress was a gem. I got the salad with steak. And if I may... Make a suggestion. It came with standard \"salad\" fare. Carrots, mushrooms, green peppers..... But this is a Mexican restaurant. ??So I asked for black beans to be added and to leave the carrots off. And they didn't have a special dressing for it. I would add something like this to make it more authentic. Maybe a cilantro-lime or spicy ranch?? And I was so disappointed that they were out of Salsa Verde. Who runs out of Salsa verde at a Mexican place? That's like McD's running out of bigmac sauce. Lol. 
Over all the salad was good. Steak cooked perfectly and a huge portion. Guac was very good too. 
My daughter was pleased with her plate of burritos ... So it was a good visit. 
Nice atmosphere and fair prices. Love the architecture."}
{"text":"This place is plain nasty!  The salsa is tomato sauce with  a few chunks of tomato, you have to pay for extra tortillas for your fajiita . Flavorless ."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant over 20 times. The service is always great and the portions are ridiculous. The pricing is some of the best I've seen.

I recommend the mango margarita (upgrade to cadillac). The salsa is great, cilantro, diced tomato, red and green onion, thin sauce, served with house made chips (so much better still warm). The guacamole is a good choice and worth the $3. Also, the cheese sauce is very good and extremely addicting. Only negatives is filling up on guac and cheese sauce before you get your entree.

I really like the combination dinners, which have every option under the sun. Then you personalize them by choosing your meat or cheese filling. All the combos come with rice and re-fried beans (I get no beans and they give you a lot more rice). I love the colorado steak (tender, reminds me of beef stew meat). Then I usually get the shredded chicken in an enchilada or the chimichanga (please try). The burrito is addicting with colorado beef inside, smothered in cheese and burrito sauce. The fajitas are good and are a part of my regular rotation. The flatus's are good, everything is good here.

You won't have any room left for desert, but if you try the cheesecake chimichanga once, you'll save room the next time. Tortilla stuffed with cream cheese filling, fried until crunchy, with some surprisingly good whipped cream. Trust me on this, best Mexican in the area. I love you Nuevo, always and forever."}
{"text":"We think it's Great.   Been going there for 20 years.   Our favorite is the Steak Tacos Carbone.  The margarItas are good and strong."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you - this place is great!

We have been coming here for a few years now.  The food is fantastic.  We've ordered at least half of the menu and have liked everything we've tried.  The portions are huge and you get at least 2 meals from an entree.  The margaritas are great as well and they do not skimp on the tequila!      

The staff is so friendly and treat you like family.  The service is always great.  

We've also ordered takeout several times and they even give you chips and salsa with the takeout order."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant with a great vibe and exciting decor as well as delicious cuisine. I feel like it is one of the more authentic places I've been to. Went in on Cinco De Mayo and they had a live Elvis impersonator singing! 

Friendly people too, a stranger at the bar payed for my margarita!

Great food at a fair price. I had the burrito asado and was mucho impressed."}
{"text":"The service was great, even on a Saturday night. The food was average. 
I ordered the Chile Rellenos and I was not impressed.  My wife was happy with her Margerita
This place is average at best. I recommend Lucitas over this place."}
{"text":"SO happy to see this North Olmsted restaurant turn into a chain!!  The only Mexican restaurant in the area we'll go to now. The staff is always friendly and attentive. Been there a few times and have loved everything, especially the chicken taquitos, the Mexican pizza and the guacamole!  My picky daughter LOVES the kids taco and burrito dishes!!  Will be back again, soon!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place? It started out well and have eaten here numerous times. The past few times eating here the service and food has been very inconsistent. 

A couple of nights ago the salsa was very watery, the green sauce was very watery and bitter. The food was very salty. 

The previous visit was good and the one prior to that was terrible. Food kept coming out cold three times. The rice was crunchy and dried out like it put under a heat lamp or broiler. 

Very disappointed at how this restaurant  has went down hill."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican Food and great service. I had the fajita trio portions are really nice size too big for lunch but done well with rice, beans and all the trimmings. We also love the chips and dip and always get queso  it's rich and creamy very good I wish the salsa was a little finer it's chunky but really great favor and unlimited chips. Great place to drop in if your in a hurry service is on top of things and food gets to the table fast and hot yum! Of course we will be back :)"}
{"text":"First off this place has the most interesting decor and will leave your eyes entertained for awhile. 
You're given salsa and chips when you first arrive and the salsa is very very tasty! Our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed and didn't speak much, almost like she was annoyed we were there although the place was not crowded at all. 
I ordered a chicken enchilada with green sauce, this came with rice and beans which lacked any actual taste but the enchilada definitely made up for this! The chicken was so flavorful and the portions are very large. In the end this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. I could eat it everyday. I was raised in SoCal so I know great vs. good. This is mid-road. Good for the area.  Would come again. I got the lunch beef chimichanga & the hubs got shrimp ceviche"}
{"text":"The food quality has dropped! The margaritas are still the very best around anywhere. The service is great but what's with the food? Being from San Antonio and a chef myself I just don't think it's that hard to make but yet they seem to serve yuck sometime. Come-on guys get it together!!!"}
{"text":"Noticeable dip in food quality - Improved Staff and Great Environment!

When Nuevo Acapulco opened, my wife and I really enjoyed the food,  environment and service.  We stopped going after a waiter double charged us after a poor service.  That same waiter had delivered some really poor service in the past and we had enough of management's refusal to deal with their problem employee.

Since that experience, the waiter is no longer an employee at NA and the service staff we've dealt with since are amazing.  One young lady (I forgot her name) explained each dish in detail and made recommendations based on our questions.  She aslo did a great job moving the meal along and was very attentive.

The restaurant itself is always clean and has traditional bright colors and a good Mexican feel.  The TVs in the seating area are tuned to sports and are a little distracting in the main seating area.  The bar is really nice but often times there is not a dedicated bartender.  The manager/owner ends up making the drinks as they have time; which can be a problem.

The real concern at NA is the current food quality.  During a recent visit, my entire group noticed that the proteins for our food were all severely over cooked and the rice and beans were both cold when served.  Since everyone has a bad day, we returned for another visit and had the same experience with the proteins; to the point that my wife could not chew through her \"steak.\"  During our last visit, we order a Chimichanga that was fired very lightly in very heavy oil.  As a result, the part that was fried was very greasy and most of the tortilla was raw.  On top of that, the shredded pork was very fatty and under seasoned.

NA had a ton of potential and was a great restaurant when it first opened.  However, over the past six months, the food quality has decreased a great deal.  It may be a matter of consistency as some reviewers still enjoy the food and continue to give it good reviews.  With the variety of Mexican places around, this place used to be at the head of the class; now it's just another C+ to B- option."}
{"text":"Wow! Fantastic food! Amazing service and a fantastic staff! We will be going back for certain!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Nuevo Acalpulco for at least 15 years but recently have felt the quality is going downhill.  Dined there again last evening and ordered the 3 chicken enchiladas with the 3 different sauces and really felt like the plate had been sitting in the back and been warmed up when I ordered it.  Rice was dry...fortunately, I order whole pinto beans so I could put those on top of the rice with some of the bean liquid to moisten the rice.  Enchiladas were dry and the sauces were already soaked into the enchilada.  Very disappointing.  Since my last 3 visits have been like this I am thinking it's time to find a new favorite for Mexican.  Very sad :-("}
{"text":"This place has become really bad. Service and food. I used to come religiously every Friday but the last few times were such a bad experience that I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in 2014 and been very impressed both times. The tableside guacamole is amazing (try asking for extra fresh ground black pepper) and even though the menu looks somewhat traditional, the spices, preparation, and presentation make a big difference. Even though I've never been here until recently, I could tell that they were desperately trying to separate themselves from a lesser past (manager? owner?)

Either way, its darn amazing stuff. I got a gigantic Cadillac margarita and had to have my wife drive. That thing is tougher than I am!

Plenty of vegetarian and seafood choices for those who cannot properly digest cows. Portion size is completely out of control - come hungry, leave with two lunches!"}
{"text":"Nice decent Mexican food. Huge portions! They have a really good guacamole that they prepare at the table. It's delicious. I ordered it the first time I was there and the only problem was I didn't realize how large their portions are so it was way too much food for me and my friend. It would be great to share for a large party. They have a good vegetarian selection and great margaritas. Very festive decor. Friendly staff. It's part of a small motel complex on a ver busy section of Lorain rd. which makes entry, exit and parking a bit challenging."}
{"text":"This was my second experience here and I absolutely love this place. The food and the atmosphere is so inviting and homey. The best part was the table side guacamole, so good!! What impressed me the most was the owner, Manuel, came around and greeted us and checked in with us throughout the dinner. So happy with this place!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the area!  They have a lengthy menu with great options to choose from.  The worst part is the wait but that just goes to show how great this place is.  Their margaritas are tasty and their portions will always leave you enough for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland area. Authentic, fresh and delicious!  Huge servings and affordable prices, definitely try the tableside guacamole"}
{"text":"I've traveled all over the world.  Mexico is the only country where I've never had a bad meal.  I've got a love/hate relationship with Nuevo.  I hate the fact that they don't use shredded chicken.  Cubed chicken chunks have no place in Mexican food.  But I love their spicy green salsa which is available by request.  One time they claimed they ran out of it but I asked the waiter for some in Spanish and the waiter \"found some.\"  You know it's an authentic restaurant when you have to order in their native language to get special treatment.  This is the best Mexican restaurant I've found in CLEvage.  If you have found a better one in the area please contact me.  I give Nuevo the Joe \"Bean\" Esposito award.  You're the best around .  Nothing is gonna ever keep you down."}
{"text":"Well this place is good if you don't have the better \"Cozumel in Lakewood\" on your mind. Absolutely everything is a step down here unfortunately. It's still relatively good, but there are a few things that just dont have that much \"love\" in it. Good overall, but if you're close enough, just go to Cozumel on Detroit."}
{"text":"I love a good Mexican restaurant, and I also love a deal; this place...is both:)

(WARNING; there will be humor in this post:)

My Wife and I visited this place for a meeting up with some folks, and we were pleasantly surprised. From the outside, Nuevo Acapulco looks modest and unassuming, inside, it's quite large and amazingly busy.

The reason for the busy? The food is really well priced, and you get a LOT of it!

Their menu has a wide range of standard Mexican-American fare, from burritos to enchiladas and salads to just your standard appetizers, all of it moderately priced. The staff were nice, very genial folks who were RUNNING LIKE SPRINTERS to make sure that the customers were taken care of.

We ordered, and then...THE FOOD CAME. 

I have never seen such MASSIVE STUFF people. I saw a plate handed over that I thought, for a startling moment, was a swaddled baby on a plate, IT WAS A BURRITO!! It was that big! I got just two enchiladas (and I know now why they give you the option to buy just one,) it was gigantic. One poor fellow sitting across from me just sat there, staring at his plate of a mole' type stew, muttering \"I can't eat all this!\" My wife is STILL eating leftovers after two days...and they're STILL GREAT!

I was very impressed. The food was good, and despite a noise level somewhere near a roar, (they were really busy that night,) the food was great. Our drinks were never empty, and the service was very fine. 

So, if you're on the West Side, are a bit peckish, love Mexican, and have a REALLY BIG appetite (seriously, bring friends, many, many friends,) hit Nuevo Acapulco and settle in for a taste fiesta!!:)"}
{"text":"My sweetheart and I were seated promptly and asked for our order almost immediately. The chips and salsa arrived moments later.  Points for eagerness. The salsa and chips were the high points of our meal, by far. We had a hard time deciding because of the size of the menu, but we each chose a dinner combination. Mine had a chicken taco, cheese enchilada, and beef tamales. I took one bite of the taco and put it down. Something was off, but I gave the other elements of the combo a chance. They were okay. Not great. Not awful. I wouldn't get it again, and I'm a little worried about how I will feel tomorrow. 

The decor is garish and almost as loud as the dining room. My sweetheart and I had to raise our voices considerably to be heard over the din. We finally gave up on conversation and flagged someone down to get our check. Service was inconsistent but polite. 

If I go back, I'll skip the meal and try their tableside guacamole and a margarita."}
{"text":"Curious as to why everyone raves about this place. Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed a weird smell to the restaurant, it smelled of urine. We sat down in a corner booth, and my girlfriend asked, \"Does it smell like piss in here?\" I know Mexican food has its own aroma, but I've never been able to compare it to urine. 

It took a good 10 minutes for our waitress to arrive, I ordered an 1800 margarita (strong but overly sweet), and my girlfriend got a Paloma (this was delicious). I tried to order the vegetarian burrito because of the divine vegetable selection, and I asked to add steak, willing to pay an up charge. I was told they couldn't add steak, but I could add beef, chicken, or pork. However, I could order the steak fajita burrito and add all the vegetables I wanted. Now, does that make sense? The portions were huge, almost too big, but the flavor was nothing to brag about. I want to love this place, but after my first visit, I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":". I have gone there several times in the past and the food was always excellent. Again this last time- the good was wonderful. However, the service had another thing to be desired.

My friend and I asked for extra sour cream. I understand that there might be some small nominal fee. But $1.50 for extra sour cream, I couldn't believe that when I saw my bill. I asked the waitress why we were not told. She just stood and said nothing. I told her that I didn't feel that I should have to pay ( but I would) because that is was way too much for sour cream. I understand she doesn't make the rules but she was very rude to me and said let me get the manager. Also the thing that really ticked me off was when he was clearing the plates to go to get the manager- she almost knocked salsa all over my friend. Obviously it was because she was ticked that I as a paying customer had the nerve to question something. 

The manager said he was sorry and I did point out he needs to tell his waitress she needs to be nicer to customers.

I agree with the other reviewer on here- next time I will go to El Rodeo!"}
{"text":"Terrible Mexican food, I would have given them zero stars if I could!! Enjoyed the chips and salsa as well as the queso dip although it was a little watery. The enchiladas have canned sauce that is flavorless and are filled with very low quality cheese that is chewy and rubbery. As soon as I tried the enchilada I knew I couldn't even have another bite of them. Hard tacos were good, they have a Taco-Bell quality, I'd rather go to Taco Bell then pay a 30$ tab for sub par food. Margaritas are good but food is poor quality.... I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Another underwhelming experience. Bland and below average even by stripmall Mexican standards."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican in Cleveland. The arroz con pollo cannot be beat. I get it without the tortillas because you really don't need them. The enchiladas and other fare is also very good. Their salsa is fresh with tomatoes, cilantro and onions...sometimes can be a little heavy on the pepper, but not too hot."}
{"text":"Very average Mexican food.  But I'm from Arizona where Mexican food flows like the Ohio river during a tragic flood. 

Service was just fine.   Chips and salsa were very good.  Food came hot and quick.  I ordered the spinach Quesadilla and it was very tasty and large.  But the rice and beans were dry and VERY bland.  Maybe it was just that day.   

I love Mexican food. And if I'm ever in the area, I'll try this place again and update my review."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food. It is seasoned just right. The menu is extensive and offers many options of delicious plates. The Cadillac margaritas are great. They are a bit expensive for the pitchers but I guess it's worth it since surrounding Mexican restaurants have mediocre margaritas. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The wait staff is also so pleasant. It's always very welcoming."}
{"text":"If you're in the area and like Mexican this is the place for you. The food is delicious and the portions are huge. I can't say enough good things about the staff as well. Three adult eating and drinking and our bill was under $100 and that included a 25% tip. We loved it and will return when we're back in North Olmsted!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been coming here for almost 10 years now and never once brought me. After not much persuasion, we made a visit on a Friday night around 5.

It was only just starting to get crowded but we got a seat right away. Service is crazy fast. We had our soda and our order in in under 6 minutes and our food in front of us in another 6 minutes. This sometimes is a red flag to me, as it is a tell tale sign that there may be a great deal of pre-made ingredients. 

I'll start with the red salsa. It's ok. I've had better. I would have preferred something spicier, but c'est la vie. I'll spring for the green salsa next time. Chips, not very fresh, I wish they could have warmed them up or something. Not complaining, its just the little things that take something from meh to great. 

I got a 2 beef taco and enchilada combo. I thought the enchilada was really good. Tacos could probably have been seasoned better, but again, not complaining. I put some salt and hot sauce on them and they were more my speed. They came with beans and rice. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican rice anyway, but the beans were decent. What you would expect.

The price was decent too. We both ate our fill with food to spare for about $25.00. 

I'll definitely be back! I've been told the margaritas are pretty good, and I'd like a couple more of those enchiladas! Hm... girls night!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My parents usually prefer to dine in a more fancy setting, but even they can't help but fall in love with this place. My parents and I have gone their alone and with friends on multiple occasions. There is decent parking in the back. The price is affordable. The food is great, the atmosphere is always lively, and the waiters are always nice. We've celebrated my birthday, my parents' birthdays, my parents anniversary, and so many more events there. I really do love this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want a giant plate of oily, cheesy, soupy Mexican food, this is the place for you.  It couldn't be less authentically Mexican, but it sure is big.  Lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Oh I love this place.  The food is not the typical Mexican fare with icky crud on the plate that is unrecognizable from the other crud on the plate.  I typically get one of the skirt steak concoctions (yes, I'm so pathetic, I can't recall the dish names - but hey... top right side of the menu, go look yourself!).  The flavors are yummy.  And important... DISTINCT.  

The salsa... inconsistent.  When it is good, it's really good.  And other times... meh.  But, not BAD, never bad.  (Yeah... I have had some BAD salsa, and this sometimes just edges to a little ho hum.)  

Margaritas?  Yes please.  I like the gold margarita, and get it on the rocks with salt.  MMMMM.  :)  

This is a yummy place.  The smells are awesome.  The building is next to a pay by the hour hole in the wall, and looks very unassuming. (I've never actually SEEN hookers, but I'm suspicious...  LOL) Try it.  You'll like it!"}
{"text":"Wow the reviews of this place make it seem like it's amazing. Clearly the people of North Olmsted have not had real Mexican before. Mexican food does not consist of cheddar cheese, they use Chihuahua cheese at the other restaurants. Got the enchiladas with the three different sauces with a soft taco. The taco tasted good but it was equivalent to taco bell. The enchiladas were so greasy and rubbery from the fake cheese blend and one of the employees told us the sauce on the enchiladas came from a can and was not fresh. Oh my god...explains it all. On the upside the margaritas, chips salsa and queso were phenomenal."}
{"text":"Maybe we should change the name of this blog to:  \"Mexican Food:  What's Not to Like?\"  Yes, we love it and we had to continue our Mexican feeding frenzy by having dinner at Nuevo Acapulco in North Olmsted on Lorain Rd.  Neither of us had been here in years for some reason that I can't quite pinpoint since we clearly love Mexican food, it's five minutes from our house, and our friends rave about it constantly.  Call us stubborn, call us morons, whatever, we just didn't go.  I'll tell you right now, that is seriously going to change!

It was a Friday night and the parking lot (which it shares with a motel) was packed and their were people waiting for seats.  Typically this would make us turn right around, however a sign said that seating in the bar area was first come first serve and a table had just opened, so we walked right in and sat down.  Such luck!  Chips and salsa immediately appeared on the table, as if by magic, and then we were asked about drinks seconds later.  We both ordered cheladas, made with Pacifico.  If you have never had a chelada, it is a drink made with tomato juice, hot sauce, and the beer of your choosing. (I think this is how it's made, that's how it tastes at least!)  It's like a Bloody Mary made with beer and I assure you it is good -- and spicy to boot... Oh!  And the rim of the glass is lined with salt  and a lime like a Margarita.  This drink was great.  Not only that, but the bar tender personally came over to make sure we liked them.  Apparently he doesn't get many requests for this gem of a beverage.

The chips and salsa were delish!  And the chips and salsa were constantly being refilled.  We never once asked, more chips and salsa just kept appearing on the table!  More magic :)  We also ordered guacamole to go with our chips, which was very good as well.

Now for dinner we both ordered burritos.  Jason had the Macho Burrito with picadillo.  It was very good and stuffed with what appeared to be two pounds of shredded beef!  I had the Burrito Relleno, thinking to myself that a burrito stuffed with a stuffed relleno pepper sounded like the best thing on Earth.  I assure you, I was not mistaken!  Picture it:  A giant burrito (fills the entire plate) stuffed with rice, beans, cheese AND a big poblano pepper, also stuffed with cheese!  This could be the best burrito I have ever had, rivaling the chimichanga I had in Tucson at El Charro.

With my mouth half full of my third burrito bite, I exclaimed to Jason that THIS was now for sure my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland vicinity.  He still holds to Mi Pueblo being number one....  I'm not so sure...  I guess I'll just have to go back to both and try them each again.....  :)"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite local mexican restaurant to dine at. I love their salsa and enchiladas. The last time I was there I had an amazing frozen margarita, it was magnificent. The food is always hot, and the servers are always very attentive to our table when we dine here. I usually go once month, if I could afford to dine out more often, I would be here for their delicious mexican food."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday.  ABSOLUTELY the WORST Mexican food I have ever had.  The Mystery meat in the taco salad was HORRIBLE AND thankfully (in an odd way) the taco salad was literally a salad almost solely Lettuce.  However was still inedible.  Taco salad at $9.00,  so obviously as far as food goes,  (how do you screw up a simple taco salad?) It's a cute restaurant. The server was great. But i will NEVER return."}
{"text":"I am from San Diego California and I was very concerned that I would not be able to find Mexican food of the caliber I was used to.  It took me 3 months but I found the place, excellent flavors and margaritas that rival my home town.  All the other reviewers are correct parking is sometimes difficult and the lines can be long but trust me they are well worth it."}
{"text":"Chicken in both our dinners seemed like it was out of a can.  At least shred it so it looks real.  Felt rushed to leave even though there were several open tables.  Probably will not return for another visit."}
{"text":"I used to go to the one all the time in Berea and loved it. Tonight my boss and I went out because it's close to her house and I just love Mexican food. The waitress was friendly and VERY prompt. The sangria and pina coladas were very tasty. 

I would've given it a higher rating, except my $10 Macho burrito came with chicken thigh meat. I've never gone to a Mexican place and received thigh meat in my burrito before. It's always been the breast meat. I never liked the texture of chicken thighs and I'm convinced they have an after taste. It might just be in my head. Anyway, there was enough lettuce, rice, and tomato to fill me up. I took the rest home, but was saddened. Chicken thighs are cheap cuts of meat. There's no reason for a chicken thigh burrito to be $10. 

I'll come back next time I'm out with coworkers, but I'll definitely be looking for something different to order. Or I might just have drinks. The chips were good, the salsa was very watery. If the waitress hadn't been so awesome, I'd have given 2 stars. The hosts and hostesses were not the nicest, but it could be because the place was swamped. We asked if there were any open seats at the bar. They kept saying, \"it's first come first serve.\" We can read the sign, we're just asking if any seats are open. We just gave up, shoved the crowd aside, checked, then put our names in. 

The parking is pretty terrible. It's adjacent to a motel, so you have to go back pretty far to park. The farther back you go in the hotel complex, the shadier it looks. I got freaked out and just waited for someone to leave to get a spot. It just seemed like a perfect location to get raped if you're a young adult female (which I am)."}
{"text":"Got to disagree with many here who find Nuevo Acapulco really good.
Lousy food and uninspired servers just didn't merit the praise. Try another place before this."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here numerous times.  This particular night was a Sunday during the winter.  We sat in the bar so that we could drink Margaritas and watch the Browns.  We had SO much fun!  

We ordered the tableside Guacamole and were impressed with the freshness of the ingredients.  We ordered the shrimp fajitas which came with a choice of pinto beans, black beans, or refried beans (I love that!)  Everything was delicious.

The evening we were there, there was a church group preparing boxes of goodies for college students (they had 60 boxes to pack!)  The staff had pushed tables together to accommodate them and the group was drinking margaritas, eating dinner, and having a good time!  Everyone was happy and friendly.  It was a fun night!

The food is delicious, margaritas are the best around, and the staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and bland. This place made me sick after eating there. I got the steak fajitas. They were under seasoned. The onions and peppers were way too hard, like they needed to be cooked longer. 

My fiancé got the burrito asada. His was the same way. We didn't even eat half of our stuff and had to call it quits, although we were hungry. 

Up side, the guac was good. I also enjoyed their refried beans."}
{"text":"Chose to go here twice instead of competition, and the food is very good. The place needs a little more organization, as in , a working website and easy access to phone numbers, but staff is friendly and food is great."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and this is my first time in Cleveland. My friends and I didn't want to sit down and have dinner tonight so we order some tacos, quesadillas, and a steak burrito to go. The food was amazing, despite some of the quesadillas weren't made as specified we were still satisfied."}
{"text":"Upon further review, don't go combo meal!   The regular stand by of the combo meal maybe deemed as safe but not going to lead to happy taste buds.  As part of a party of four, those who went for regular meals fared better than the #5 or #8 combo.  Really chimichanga or chicken chipotle or #5 which sounds better to you?

The chicken chipotle was a very nice sauce.  It had a little bite and if you added more inside the tortilla it would make you sweat. I choose to add sour cream.  Chicken was perfect.  It comes with rice and beans.  In vegetarian options the potato chimi and cheese enchillita  were better than the ground beef options..  There must be a low level of beef in play here.  Twice in a row ground beef, didn't fare well.

The modela negra was a very nice change from the usual dos equis amber."}
{"text":"Be warned, parking here is a challenge. Don't park in the Drug Mart parking lot, they WILL tow you. Sure, the hotel next to it makes it look like prostitute alley.....but you gotta get past all that yo! The food here is truly amazing. Fresh salsa, crunchy chips and the best refried beans this side of the Peso. I am in love with the fajita platter here and their guacamole here is a religious experience. The interior of this place is colorful and hand painted. The staff has been pretty much the same as long as I can remember it....which makes the experience even better. The restrooms? Well.....they are small and kinda scary looking. Use at your own risk. The food and service here makes it all worth it!"}
{"text":"Have been eating at Nuevo Aapulco for many years, and I always get the veggie burrito sans dairy.  It's delicious, and to say it is huge is an understatement.  It easily makes three meals for me.  The service is always good and I love that the food is consistent."}
{"text":"Come for the margaritas, stay for the food.  Everything I've had here has been well prepared and the service is always reliable.  As others have said, expect a short wait on the big date nights, but it's worth it.  They're always cool with accommodating larger groups."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not good. Colorful mural on the wall but the rest of the interior is dated. The tortilla chips were good but the salsa was very watery. Ordered the dish with three crispy tacos, two chicken and one beef, chicken was dry but beef was good and they all came with shredded lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. Some sour cream would of helped. The rice was dry and of the boxed quality and the refried beans were...refried beans. The waitress brought me the wrong order but caught the mistake before I started. Service was not bad but not good. The only person working there that should any enthusiasm was the guy creating animals out of balloons tableside. No need to go back."}
{"text":"Nuevo Acapulco has managed to maintain a high quality of flavor & taste in it's food offerings, over the many years I have eaten here.

The star of this place the food offerings cater to many tastes from the typical Mexican dishes to some of their house specials.  To start their baked corn chips are just the right crisp & their chunky salsa is the perfect middle of chunk & heat factor. Each person gets their own bowl of salsa so you can double dip at your hearts desire. Most all their entree run in $10 - $12 per dish price range however the portions in each entree is suitable for two. It's best to order multiple dishes and share it all.  Their margarita are strong so drink moderately if you are a lightweight when it comes to your tolerance of alcohol. Nuevo Acapulco have received several accolades over the years for their great food - this for good reason. 

 What has been inconsistent is the quality of attention from it's staff. Much to ups and downs. Their service is of very good quality now (better times).  At my latest visit I found the service to be just what you'd expect from a down-home Mexican eatery - fast, friendly in the quintessential Mexican eatery sort of way.  If you have queations about an item, ask the wait staff they will give you a decent idea about it. When the service is good like these days - it's good in the down home attentive sort of way don't expect fine linen or table side food prep here but do expect mouth watering Mexican affair."}
{"text":"We were there 1/11/18 
[My son's birthday ]My group and family was very disappointed in the lack of service . Food was ok but the service was terrible . Food made wrong waited on basic things we repeatedly ask for and didn't get . It was my son's birthday which we told the waiter twice he told us know , I know, ; finally he brought us the check and never did sing the birthday song to my son . We didn't get refills or  extra napkins we repeatedly ask for some of our  food had to be remade . He barley came to our table ,We were stacking empty plates on our table to make space to comfortably eat . There are so many other Mexican Food restaurants out there that give service and make quality food I'd reconsider coming to this one . It's not our first bad experience here but it will be our last one . It's a very cute place but lacks quality in service and tasty food ."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food here. My friends and I came here after having some strong tasty drinks from Porco (yes it's quite a drive but we were all craving heavy food). The restaurant was not too busy but I was told it's usually packed on the weekend nights. 

It was my first visit here but my friends have been here and recommended that I get their combo plates. I ended up with combo #4 consisting of a beef taco, chicken enchiladas, and tamale, this was also served with a side of rice and beans. 

The portion was massive! The 14\" plate was covered with food. I started with the taco. The crunchy shell was full of flavorful ground beef with fresh lettuce and large cuts of tomatoes. The enchilada was stuffed with very tender chicken and covered in a light cheese sauce. The tamale was filled with marinated pulled pork wrapped in a corn/flour shell. I was only able to finish half of this entree and I was quite hungry before dinner! The leftovers were delicious the next day as well. I did add some fresh arugula to give it the impression that it's healthier... 

The service here was good, the waiter and servers were very attentive and the food came out quickly and hot."}
{"text":"I actually enjoy this place quite a bit in general, but I believe what really won me over (and what gives this place a 5 star rating) is their margaritas! Their strawberry margaritas are some of the best I have ever had. Their consistency and flavour is amazing, and they are definitely not shy about the amount of alcohol they put in it.

Their ambiance is nice, everyone there is friendly, and their food is authentic - well as authentic as I expected. 

The location isn't the best. In my opinion it's more like a hidden gem - it's right in front of a motel, so to the naked eye looks a little unappealing. The actual restaurant; however, does not reflect the surrounding location. 

I have frequented there many times since I've been working in the North Olmsted area. Their portions are huge, and their food is a solid 4! I am surprised at anyone who can actually finish their meal when they get there. Whenever I go I always just order a side - and even sometimes that is too much. 

I've had their Chalupa's, their Chimichanga's, their burrito's, their chips and cheese dip and their fried ice cream - each of which is pretty good. And of course their margaritas - did I mention they were amazing?"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food! Their service never disappoints. My fave? The customizable guacamole  they come to your table with a rollable cart and make perfect guac every time!"}
{"text":"Great service. 
Great food. 
Great prices. 
Huge portions. 
Hot plates. 

One of the best Mexican restaurants on the west side."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to Restuarant when we have a special event, birthday, graduation, friends in town, etc. Everyone loves it. The meals are huge. The chips and salsa are excellent. And the service is always good. 
My favorite thing to order is pollo jalapeños. Pollo chipotle is similar and also amazing. Their chili verde is another favorite. 
They have a great kids menu too!"}
{"text":"Maybe I came on a bad night, but I can only sat they were mediocre at best, and I think I'm giving too much credit. The food looked good, but that was about it. It came out luke warm and they forgot parts of the meal for me and my significant other's plate. I ordered shrimp that comes over a bed of rice with cheese sauce. The cheese sauce is either a mistake or the food was sitting for too long before it got to me. My significant other's plate was like warm as well. They forgot my beans, they were nice and brought then right out, but they too were luke warm. To me the food was slightly bland. I had some guacamole and that was flavorful. I did not get table side, just what comes with the meal. The plate they served my significant other's food on was chipped so keep your eye open if you come. Last but not least, my meal came with only seven shrimp (yes I counted and I always do). Unfortunately all but two of them still had the poop vein hanging out the tail. I can't even explain how much I hate that!!!!! I may come back because I always give restaurants a second chance, but to be honest I won't be rushing. I hope you guys have a better dining experience the we did."}
{"text":"The food is fine here, but their \"salsa\" is a mystery. Tomato juice with onions and tomatoes thrown in, with a little cilantro. Come to my house: I make a far better salsa. 

On the other hand, get the cheese crispy appetizer. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Cut from the same cloth as el rodeo- better than Taco Bell but NOT authentic. A Mexican Sizzler"}
{"text":"If there is better Mexican in Cleveland I can't find it. (And I'm open to suggestion, people!)

But yeah, I love this place! Good food, big portions, a nice sized menu, and even a big 'a la carte' section. And the margaritas are made from scratch, not mixes like nearly all the other restaurants. It's always worth the wait."}
{"text":"As far as Mexican restaurants go, this is one of my favorites.  Good margaritas too.  The location is a little strange (it's attached to an old motel) but this place has been here as long as I can remember and the quality has remained consistent."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican restaurant.

They have a variety of salsas, which I love, ranging from red (mild) to green (hot) to dirt color (extremely hot - habanero).

Try the stuffed jalapenos. Absolutely amazing 

Check this place out"}
{"text":"By far best Mexican in the cleveland area! Monday taco nights are a go to... they let you order out the $1 tacos! Great authentic Mexican, fast service and great margaritas!"}
{"text":"Nuevo Acapulco was sub-par mexican to me. Their salsa was unlike any other mexican place i've been to and was a strange consistency. It was also overly spicy and had beans in it. I wasn't a huge fan. The margarita was good, but was overly sugary. I had a tostada with chicken. It was decent, there just wasn't a wow factor. I was really excited for what I thought was an authentic mexican restaurant and I just felt like this place didn't deliver what I expected."}
{"text":"The best mexican restaurant ive been to so far! The food was delicious, huge portions and our waiter was so nice! From the enchiladas to the fried ice cream it was all delicious you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I've emerged from my mexican food coma to write this review.  I went for lunch and left happy and full.  Not a big lunch menu, but it's got everything you could want.  Service was fast and friendly.  The chips were flowing and delicious.  Goes the same for the salsa.  

I ordered the chicken burrito, comes on a big platter with rice and beans.  No complaints here!  Price is right, I think it was $7.50 for the whole platter.  If you are looking for something healthy, you won't find it here.  But for great mexican food with excellent service go to Nuevo Acapulco!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Been here plenty of times and never had bad service or food.  The menu isn't terribly authentic, but it's a little more creative than standard mexican restaurants.  I've never had trouble finding a parking spot behind the building.  This is just one of those reliable places if you feel like overeating on above average mexican food."}
{"text":"Good food? Great prices? Huge portions? Nuevo Acapulco is the answer! Whether you are looking to put yourself in a Mexican food coma or feed a small army on a budget, this place will  work and you won't be running for the toilet afterward. I've enjoyed everything I have tried from here so far: Chicken Taquitos, Poblano Rellenos, and Taco's Al Carbon. I mean, it's nothing fancy, they say they are authentic Mexican food (a little Americanization up in there still I think) and the inside has a ton of tropical birds decorating it, but I like it and apparently so does everyone else because there is always a wait when you want to dine in (and a fight for a parking space). So I suggest take out. That way you can sit at home and stuff your face without judgement."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite Mexican restaurants that I have ever been to.  Whether it or authentic or not, I think they do a great job and I leave satisfied each and every time I have the pleasure of going to this place.  

Found in front of whatever the flavor of the month name is (Knights Inn, Days Inn, Comfort Inn, etc), this place is YUMMO!  Great service, fabulous margaritas, and an overall clean environment... and the food is good too!  

I still miss the white cheese dip... the Mexican place on the corner where I live now just does not do it for me.  Nuevo Acapulco, I miss you :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Nuevo Acapulco several times and the food is always hot, fresh and delicious.  The table-side guac is addictive.  Last time I ordered the fajitas and they were fantastic.  The place is neat and clean, and the wait staff is attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Revising & dropping the rating. Went there last night and it was beyond horrible. Guac was delicious but that's where it ended. Took 40 minutes for our food to come! I had 2 enchiladas: the chicken one was luke warm & the cheese one was very cold-cheese wasn't even melted. Sent it back and got a greasy plate from melted cheese. My daughter got a potato burrito (vegan) and she said it was awful. It didn't sound appetizing to me, but she eats almost anything! I will return for guac, but the food isn't anything special."}
{"text":"Great food awesome atmosphere the service is out of this world the food is always made fresh the chips and salsa are so good i tend to take some home especially the guacamole"}
{"text":"I have eaten at most Mexican places in the area, and this one is far superior then the rest.  There might be an argument that the quality and presentation has gone done over the past few years, and I might even agree with you.  I have to draw the line when I read that El Rodeo was better...COME ON NOW lol   

B+   great service, plentiful food portions, and pretty tasty salsa

Take it from me...   The 350 pound reviewer"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a number of times over the last few years and never had any complaints until December 2014.

My monthly credit card statement indicated that Nuevo Acapulco had charged me double the amount of my actual bill. Since I had the original receipt, I thought it would be a simple matter to correct the charge. I tried to contact management on three different days. Although the employees who took my calls tried to be helpful, no manager would return my call. I even went to the restaurant at a time when I was told the manager would be there. When I arrived, he had \"just left.\" An employee contacted the manager via cell phone and allowed me to speak to him; the manager actually told me to come back later. This upset me because I don't think I should have had to go to the restaurant at all, let alone twice. I left a copy of both the original bill and the credit card statement (which the manager told me I needed to provide), but have NEVER been contacted by management. My credit card company credited me the disputed amount, but didn't pursue it with the restaurant because it would have cost more to pursue it than to just credit it.

I hope this was just an error on the part of Nuevo Acapulo, and not deliberate rip-off. Nonetheless, I won't be returning to the restaurant because of the lousy response from management."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years! We drive almost 40 minutes for these family inspired dishes. Roberto and his family have always been more than accommodating. BEST MARGARITAS EVER, seriously! Smooth consistency and filled with a great amount of tequila. LOVE THE SALSA AND WHITE QUESO! Arroz con pollo has awesome flavor, a little pricey but great portions for a reasonable price"}
{"text":"First time here in 10 years.  The mexican pizza appetizer was awesome.  The seafood chimichanga very, very disappointing.  The menu says it has shrimp, scallops and imitation crab and veggies inside. OMG!  Their was 4 little baby shrimp, 3 baby scallops...crab?  Couldn't tell you.  The price was 12.95?  For $2 more I should have ordered one of their shrimp entrees, which come with 10 big shrimp.  If you are in the mood for a seafood dish here, do not order the seafood chimi.  Very good salsa/chips and good rice and beans...and I normally hate refried beans.  The service was wonderful and we ordered carryout.  They seem to really care.  I'd go back to try their  combo fajitas or another seafood dish."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the Number 1 place for Mexican food in Cleveland.  The drinks are delicious here as well!  

I always get a Chimichanga and enjoy it more and more each time.  The salsa is great!  I almost fill up on chips before the food actually arrives.   

Service is always very fast here, the wait might be long some nights.. but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"We order the chicken mole and then the chicken Chipotle they're both exceptionally. Great gravy sauce for both chickens great service!! The chips and salsa was excellent . the half picture of margarita was prefect."}
{"text":"went to nuevo acapulco with a party of five on a friday night a little after 8pm. the restaurant was a lot bigger than i expected, and it was packed; we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. once seated, i couldn't stop eating the chips and salsa. the chips were nice and crispy - definitely homemade, and the salsa was fresh, and not too spicy. yum. and unlike some other mexican restaurants around town, they don't charge you for refills.

nuevo has a pretty big menu, but i was surprised to find they didn't serve enchiladas mole - a pretty standard mexican dish. i did like that they offered one, two and three enchilada meals - for me, one is never enough, and three is too much. after everyone else's food arrived, i had food envy. my cheese and onion enchilada plate looked drab in comparison to the sizzling fajitas and chimichangas that came to our table. my enchiladas were just okay; i wouldn't order them again.

we also ordered a pitcher of the house margarita. it definitely packs a punch. service was pretty good too - our waiter was attentive, and provided us with water pitchers. overall, decent mexican food - i'd give it 3.5 stars if i could."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Nuevo for 20+ years and it is by far the BEST Mexican food you can eat!! All authentic made to order food, original family owned recipes! Real cheese, nothing is canned!The bar was remodeled as well, which made room for more seats at the bar and more Margarita flavors!! Fresh Jalapeño is one of the newest flavors and they're amazing! TVs with front row seats to CLE sports games,  $1 taco Mondays, $2 enchilada Tuesday's and specials everyday.  Great service and always clean.  It's a struggle to not go there! LOL Nuevo is a must!"}
{"text":"Down in Akron, there is a severe lack of great quality Mexican food and thankfully Nuevo Acapulco remedies that. The food here is great! We got cheese dip and guacamole (made table side!) for our chips and they were both heavenly. For dinner, I got the house burrito with pork. It was standard, but a slightly higher quality than you find at most Mexican places. 

The servers were very friendly and helpful. My only real complaint is that the service might have been TOO quick. As soon as they made the guac at our table, our entrees were ready and at our table, not giving us much time to munch on the cheese and guac. It crowded the table a bit, but that's better than too slow on the food. Overall, its a very yummy, relatively cheap Mexican place than is certainly worth a visit. I won't be rushing to go back, but I know at some point I will end up back at Nuevo Acapulco!"}
{"text":"I have been here at least five times. I LOVE it. By far my favorite Mexican restaurant around...I come to this location and I am from East side of Cleveland. It is the best. The guacamole is made fresh at the table...you get so much and its only $6. Taquitos were fantastic. Arroz con pollo is my favorite. I also love the carne asada. Pollo con mole is excellent as well. Honestly, there is nothing bad I can say. Sangria and margaritas are great, and the servers are fantastic. The owner is so nice and you can tell is passionate about his restaurant and loves his workers!! It's been awhile since I have been back since I live far away...but I will be making another stop soon!! ME ENCANTA!"}
{"text":"First time at Nuevo in 5 years. Guacamole made at the table was great. Can say the same for out server Ana.  Everyone  around us seemed to have attentive  wait staff, we did not. 

Tamales were good. Friend ordered cheese enchiladas, came out as beef enchiladas.  Wife ordered taco combo, one taco came out with no meat. The other was double meat with a tiny bit of cheese.  When I say no meat, the literally didn't put any on it at all.  Guess it is a new take in the make your own taco bar ;)"}
{"text":"Holy posole! With some lime and hot sauce, my posole (a hominy soup) was bursting with flavor. It's a huge portion too so I got to have more for lunch the next day. Overall, this seemed like a good place. Even though they were or of ceviche :("}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for Nuevo...It was of course Cinco De Mayo and my friend and I went during lunch hour. I expected a wait, so 15 minutes wasn't bad. But after we were seated, I asked our waitress about the drink specials they had that day (I mean you know I want a margarita) and she didn't even know. I'm going to guess she was new, because she seemed really intimidated for some reason. The crowd had cleared by the time we order our food though. 

I ordered two tacos - the meat tasted funny, I still got beans on the side after asking for none, and my hard taco shell tasted old. My friends quesadilla fell apart, her chicken wasn't cooked and it was a complete mess. 

My margarita however, was very strong, so that's always a good thing for 3.50...But after we ate, we had to wait about 25 minutes for our check. It was a little out of line, considering the place had cleared out dramatically. Next time I think I'll take my chances with El Rodeo..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant.  There are only a few Mexican places I will eat at, since most usually leave me feeling a little queasy. This one, however, is fantastic. The food is delicious, fresh, and there is a lot of it. Do yourself a favor and order the table guacamole. Also, the tacos, fajitas, burritos, etc. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Nuevo Acapulco for perhaps 15 years, and it has to be one of my favorite restaurants.  I honestly don't have a comparison it is 'authentic' or not, but nearly all my experiences have been with very tasty and plentiful food.  It's a perfect place for a fun date, a fun outing with friends, parties of people, birthdays, some drinks, etc.  I order vegetarian and am happy that they have a decent amount of veggie dishes, and even include some new ones from time to time.  Before I gave up meat, I would often get the chicken, steak and shrimp dishes as well and always liked what I had.  

The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because despite how good the food tastes and how much leftovers I have (which I consider good because then that's one less meal to cook later ha ha), some of the foods are a bit oily/greasy.  Not overly so, but if I get certain dishes I do feel they sit a bit heavy if I eat too much of the oily stuff."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this place however I ordered lunch from here today and was completely disappointed. I ordered the lunch 2 cheese enchiladas that came with rice and beans. As soon as I opened the container (I ordered it to go) the food smelled like cigarette smoke. Unfortunately I could not get past the smell of smoke to be able to enjoy the food. The rice was bland and the enchiladas were soggy. The only good part about my meal was the queso dip and chips. Needless to say I will stick with Maya in Berea!"}
{"text":"Mexican and Cleveland are uneasy partners.  Nuevo Acapulco is my go-to place when my raised-in-the-West cravings demand Mexican.   

Sure, the interior looks a bit like Disney's Tiki Room, but the staff in genuine and helpful.  Start with a classic margarita - on the rocks with salt, thank you - and sip it slowly, because it's a margie with legs.  Then enjoy the warm, fresh chips and zippy salsa while you peruse the generous menu.  Sure, you can go for standard enchiladas or burritos, but take your chances and try the tacos al carbon or the enchiladas mole.  The food is fresh and tasty.  Definitely good Mexican comfort food.

The restaurant is connected to a motel, and the parking is mostly in the back.  But don't let this scare you off."}
{"text":"Wasn't a great experience last time. We walked in and the entire place smelled like a rotting bathroom, and the smell didn't go away the whole time we were there. I didn't even want to drink my water, for fear that the smell was somehow related to the water supply. Food was decent, exactly what you'd expect at a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Coming on a visit from California, born and raised with a delicious taqueria and mercadito on every corner, I was a little bit wary of what I might find at Nuevo Acapulco.  But - it was near to my motel and got great reviews, so I gave it a try.  WOW!! I was completely impressed.  Mexican food this good in Cleveland?  Muy loco!

My dining companion and I ordered the Queso Fundido, which was tasty, greasy (as it should be, afterall it's a bubbling plate of melted cheese), and full of really lovely chorizo. Extra points for the melt-in-your-mouth roasted jalapenos on top.   

I then ordered the steak Tacos al Carbon, and they were absolutely fantastic.   The flavor of the sauce was strong but not overpowering, the steak was tender, and the overall interpretation of this dish was just superlative.  The portions were insane - both of us only ate half our plates. (and we do love to eat, so this isn't a comment on our diminutive appetites!)  The service was also noteworthy.  Friendly and swift.

The chips are nice and crispy, the beans had body and flavor.  The salsa wasn't over-the-top delicious, but it had a very authentic flavor and texture.  I'm hooked!  My stepmom and I have vowed to return before our time in Cleveland is over.  

I would choose this place over my local haunts back home if I were able.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"authentic mexican. HUGE portions. yummy salsa. scratch that. THE best salsa I have had at a mexican restaurant in cle. 
big chunky tomatoes, onions, cilantro....packs a bit of a punch, but it is so good. drizzle it over everything!
the white cheese dip. completely delish! fattening....um, yeah, but can't complain if we ordered it, right?! it is not your typical white cheesy goodness. it is full of extra spices and is seriously so yummy.
i order the seafood chimichangas, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. yep. every time. they are that good. the dish comes with rice and beans and the chimichanga is covered in this tomato/parmesan (i know....sounds weird for a mexican restaurant, but don't judge......), sauce that is heavenly. 
chips are fresh and never ending. servers are attentive. 
high fives to Nuevo Acapulco. love this place and it never disappoints. 
oh and i just saw that on mondays from 4p-close they have tacos for one dollar, hollar. yep. you read that right. one freaking dollar! and the best bet......you can order them as carry out!!! i mean, come on people~ you can't even cook at home for that price! will definitely be checking them out for those!"}
{"text":"Very good food, I loved their margaritas and the fresh guac made table side was delicious. I will for sure come back. Excellent service. We shared the fajitas my husband and I - it was plenty. The tortillas were fresh and warm. My mom got the flautas made with chicken and they were great too."}
{"text":"I like this place. It isn't fancy, they have good margaritas and the food is great (usually covered in sauce and cheese). Service is typically good, though it can get crowded."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. I've been eating here for 25 years. The quality of the food is outstanding. Try the Tacos El Carbon with steak."}
{"text":"The wait - 25 mins
The Service - Great
The food - Authentic / Meat was dry needed to be marinated linger
The decor - Nice 
The atmosphere - People getting sung happy birthday in Mexican hats, alot. Lol
The portions - Huge! My friend and I split fajitas - and my dad finished our leftovers - 1 dish filled 3 people.  

The side dinner salads are huge too. Too huge... 

4 stars because of the burnt dry meat."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in the Cleveland area.  I really can't eat anywhere else but there, so worth the drive over from Medina!  A game changer."}
{"text":"Gosh, I didn't know how I was going to write about Acapulco. While the food was excellent, the after affect was not. NO, NO, NO!!!! nothing bad about the food. I threw caution into the wind the night I was there and had an item there I was not suppose to. Well, the simple truth is, I ate too much. So much I hurt when I ate more and hurt when I got up to leave. 
I had the Steak Mexicano (which is North Olmsted for Bistec a la mexicano) for my entree and the chorizo fundido I ordered to share with my group. Both were very good. Portion size was good for the steak dish but I thought the fundido was a little on the small portion side (yes, it's an appetizer but I have seen bigger portions elsewhere).
Overall, you find the tex-mex cuisine to be delicious. Service though was a little slow. Our waitress took a least 15 mins btw getting us drinks and getting our orders. And for the size of the crowd in the restaurant the night I was there, it shouldn't have taken as long as it did for our food to be ready. But all was forgiven when food hit taste-buds."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant have came here for my birthday every year for the past 8 year's. Great salsa & green sauce great food  the best margaritas, & the table guacamole made fresh at your table can't be beat. Still my favorite Mexican restaurant by far"}
{"text":"Our first time there was last night, for my birthday. Upon entering, I couldn't believe how beautiful the place was inside. There are murals on the wall, as well as beautifully framed brass sculptures. They depict either Mexican scenery, or are indicative of a portion of Mexican culture. They had great Mexican music playing in the background, and at a perfect volume, unlike some places that try to deafen you. All in all, excellent atmosphere.
Now for the food: it was absolutely great, generous portions, very flavorful. I had the enchilada trio, which is a new addition to their menu, with tasty rice and refried beans. The other half had the chicken fajita, and exclaimed several times so wonderful the food was.

The service was great. Walked in the door and we were promptly greeted in a polite and professional manner.  The server was terrific, if when we were leaving, an older man that I think was one of the proprietors thanked us for coming and asked us to come back. We definitely will, and the sooner the better!"}
{"text":"Cheese dip great, salsa great, chips good, huge burritos with lots of breast-meat chicken, fantastic guacamole, what can I say, this place was quite good. Server was attentive and pleasant. This place is definitely 4+ stars for food and service. It was recommended by the ladies at Atlantic Aviation at Hopkins Airport. Definitely will return when back in the area."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with three buddies and we were not impressed with food at all. Atmosphere was very good. Plate presentation was very good but it doesn't make food taste good. Salsa was watery and bland. Three of us had lunch fajitas and the food was bland we could not taste any spices at all. Rice was also tasteless. The fourth person in our group was also not satisfied. While the food looked Mexican there was nothing that tasted like Mexican. I would have thought they had an Amish person in the kitchen or they forgot to add any spices to our meals."}
{"text":"By far this is the best Mexican restaurant in Cleveland.  All the food is amazing, personally I recommend the Macho Burrito and to bring a friend (or be prepared to take half of it home for a second meal)."}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Nuevo Acapulco for as long as we can remember. We usually go there about once a week...tonight was a disaster. We arrived  at 6:15 pm, we were seated at 6:45 when hostess said it would be a 10 to 15 minute wait and then she seated another 4 person party before us, we were a four person party plus a baby. 

We were seated afterwards 45 min. We ordered and after an hour and a half of waiting and not being served four regular meals we left, they served many people around us but said rice wasn't available and why they couldn't serve our food after an hour and a half. We told the waiter and the manager and they could not care less. They served another family of five that had been seated 30 minutes behind us with a full meal by the time we left. We and our WHOLE extended family will never be back."}
{"text":"Decent food and service... there was a wait and I sat at the bar....bartender  took 10 minutes to acknowledge me and take my drink order. A simple \"I'll be with you soon\" to acknowledge a customers presence... even if you're busy goes a long way..."}
{"text":"First time checking this place out.  Little slow on the drinks but food was phenomenal.  Mushroom quesadilla and table side Guacamole were high lights."}
{"text":"As upon entering was there we were greeted, the gentleman asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or dining room area opted dining room, waiter quickly brought out chips, salsa & water, waitress came out seemed to have some type of attitude took our drink order quickly brought them out, took our order we both ordered fajitas, since I don't like guacamole, sour cream & tomatoes, brought our meals out, no guac., sour cream or tortillas for my wife had to ask her for her sides you would think she would bring all 3 out for my wife but no, she had to repeat herself each time for each side, wasn't even apologetic, I had to ask for refills for my drink it wasn't even a busy evening, 5 tables max, some gentleman kept coming over asking us if everything was fine, when it was time to pay our bill she was all nice & friendly. 

   Now about the meal what can I say, not one negative comment we both enjoyed it, we never had a bad meal before, wife had a Piña Colada [virgin] was on point, I hate coconut but I would totally drink it here the balance of pineapple & coconut was spot on. The reason why I give it 3's was because of the waitress if she would've shrugged off the attitude I would've given it 4's. 

   Would the attitude of the waitress deter us from returning no, I understand we have a bad day but don't take it out on the customers..."}
{"text":"Pretty good, some of the best Mexican food I've had in Cleveland so far.  The tamales and enchiladas are great, and the refried beans are pretty tasty."}
{"text":"We've been going to Nuevo for the past 10 years and loved the place. I'm not sure what has happened these past 2 years we've noticed that the quality and service have been going down hill. The food taste was off and the waitress weren't very nice. I'd get tired of waiting for a water refill and would go get it myself. As of yesterday they've reached a new low. Now, the place is just gross and disgusting. Never again will we go back. How they can prepare food that taste so bad and the waitress that has a \"you're annoying me\" attitude.... we're done.... it's sad because now we have to find a new place... Taco Bell has a better flavor than their cardboard chemical tasting attempt at mexican food. I'm really not a picky eater but all of us were feeling ill after the dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in the Cleveland area.  They're probably best known for their margaritas, but their food is just as delicious!  The ambiance isn't impeccable, but is colorful enough and the staff is friendly.  Each wall is decorated with a brightly painted mural, which gives the place a nice feel.  There's a full bar that is usually crowded with sports fans watching a local game.  The wait isn't usually long either (no more than 20 minutes or so on a busy night).  You won't have to wait at all if you come for lunch.

This is a perfect place for large groups and kids, but not the best place for a date, etc., as it can get fairly loud/crowded at times.  The staff is more than happy to accommodate large groups.

The portions are huge, and most dishes come with beans and Mexican rice (as well as the standard complimentary chips and salsa).  

Note to vegetarians: the beans are cooked in lard."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a kid, and yes it's been around for 10+ years or so. Authentic mexican food with good atmosphere in the suburbs.

You will get plenty of food here to fill you up or take with you. Service has always been top notch. I've never had bad service here and it won't hurt your pocket either, prices are always within reason!

Go here on your birthday and you get a picture of yourself in a mexican sombrero put on the wall for humiliation."}
{"text":"Great service with a Tex Mex menu that has some nice surprises.  (For example they do table-side guacamole - a very nice tough since you get some say in the balance of ingredients and means it is ultrafresh.)

Extremely accommodating of a large group, they handled the chaos of a large group professionally and quickly. 

(They have gringo items on the menu for diners- burgers and chicken with French fries.)

Enchilada Suiza was good and what I would expect back in our home state of Texas.  

Thank you Nuevo Acapulco"}
{"text":"If it's possible for a Mexican restaurant to run like a Swiss watch, that is Nuevo Acapulco - with lines out the door on the weekends, they seem to know that a moment saved at your table puts another customer closer to a great meal. This meant that even in a busy dining room, our server stopped by regularly to make sure we had what we needed, yet we never felt rushed.

We had Chipotle Cream Chicken and Chili Verde, both excellent and both dishes not available at our local hangout. The flavors were fresh and there was real heat in the chipotle cream, a welcome surprise. The room was noisy and festive, and the margaritas were great.  Parking is tight and you might end up waiting, but Nuevo Acapulco is the really good Mexican restaurant *your* local Mexican restaurant probably wants to be."}
{"text":"Nuevo Acapulco is really the only \"Tex-Mex\" Food I bother to eat anymore.

Yea the parking sucks and the service is hit or miss but I really have never had a bad meal here.  The Carne Asada and Seafood Chimichonga have stood out as my favorites, really great food at a very reasonable price.  The portions no matter what you order are huge and the drinks are always strong no similar Tex-Mex restaurant can touch Nuevo.  

On Friday & Saturdays this place is packed so be prepared to wait, the bar is first come first serve so always try getting in there first."}
{"text":"The portions are great for the price, as well as the food itself. Surprisingly they have no spicy salsa and the few that they do have was bland. The drinks are weak and to get the happy hour special you have to go to the bar. The service is good and the decor is nice. I'm 50/50 with this restaurant and believe three stars are suitable."}
{"text":"Not the greatest Mexican in the area. It was decent, but the next time I'm in the mood for Mexican, I will go to my regular place! The tacos were dripping grease & were bland. The rice and beans were pretty bland as well. The salsa they have is swimming with black pepper. Won't be back here."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years and is the best we have found yet!!! The staff is great most have been there for as long as we have been going which makes you feel good. The chips and salsa are yummy more cilantro for my husbands taste not mine Lol. The portions are huge my hubby always gets the Mucho Burrito Colorado style and loves it. I get a la cart tamales or chimichanga or something like that so I can save room for fried ice cream!!! They do a great job here !!!"}
{"text":"What is going on at this place???? The service has gone way down. 

Food coming out wrong! 
Service is subpar at best. 
Have to beat someone down to get refills on drinks. 

Someone has got to be reading these reviews! Terrible lately!"}
{"text":"This place had so much potential. I am not sure what happened. The most recent visit was not as enjoyable. Though they did have table-side guacamole, everything else just seemed off.  One of the normal servers was limping Badly? Our main courses came out almost instantly. There is no way anything on that plate was made fresh. It was all pre-made and reheated. The server though educated in the menu just did not fit the restaurant itself. She even admitted that something that was ordered may have been miss represented on the menu. It's a newer location they are working out the kinks. What happened here?"}
{"text":"I can't say enough positive things about this place. I have been here probably 30+ times and have never been disappointed. The food is delicious authentic Mexican food. Portions are large and service is very speedy!  My favorite restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Soo...the story goes that Roberto & his friend Ruben had a Mexican restaurant somewhere around Seattle.  There were lots of Mexican restaurants in the environs and it was tough to stand out.  A traveling salesman (I know, right) from Cleveland was dining at the restaurant and said to Roberto something like, \"This is awesome Mexican food!  If you moved your restaurant to Cleveland you would do great!  There aren't enough Mexican restaurants around Cleveland.\"  

So Nuevo Acapulco came to Cleveland and the rest is history.  Nuevo Acapulco is not just a good Mexican restaurant for the Cleveland area, this is a good Mexican restaurant anywhere.  

Owner Roberto takes pride in the quality of his food and service.

Expect a wait 6-9pm weekends.

Mole is excellent.  

Not the best location, but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great mexican. I will come for table side Guac and a margarita! Along the tow path so it's perfect after a long ride! Good service!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been frequenting Nuevo Acapulco literally as long as I can remember. Truly, the best Mexican food I've ever had (and we go to Mexico every year!) Everything is delicious - even just a simple, plan chicken breast (which you can get from the a la cart menu, super cheap and diet friendly) is to die for. I'm a big fan of the fajitas, the table side guac, and of course - the margaritas (gold, on the rocks, with salt for me)! The waiters always remember us, and know that we like their salsa verde, and always bring it over along with our regular salsa the moment we sit down. I simply can't say enough good things about this place, it's unlike any other 'typical' Mexican restaurant in the area. We'll be returning for many years to come."}
{"text":"Nuevo Acapulco vs Cozumel:

I tried Nuevo Acapulco this weekend and I have to say, it's very good.  Unfortunately, it did not take the title for best fajitas in Cleveland in my opinion.  That title still belongs to Cozumel!

The margaritas at Neuvo are really delicious and some of the best I've ever had.  Compared to Cozumel, I'd say the Margaritas were a tie.

Nuevo has slightly better hot salsa for the nachos, which I really liked.  

My favorite dish is FAJITAS!  To me, how a place fixes its fajitas means a lot.  In fact, it means everything to me.  For about the same price, Cozumel gives you double the meat, onions and peppers on the simmering hot flat iron that most fajitas are served on.  Nuevo's tortillas were tough when I bit into them, a BIG turn-off for me.  The reason for this is Neuvo serves their tortillas in a plastic bowl with a lid that allows air to get in and heat to escape, whereas Cozumel serves their tortillas wrapped in aluminum foil so they're always hot and moist.  The oppings were the same between the two restaurants - guacamole, sour cream, rice, refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.

Cozumel has several locations and large parking lots that you don't have to worry about your car being towed from.  Nuevo only has one location and it's always busy.  Don't park in Drug Mart's parking lot, you could get towed and good luck finding a spot in Neuvo's lot.

Service at both restaurants is excellent.  Our server at Nuevo was friendly and he even took our guest's camera into the kitchen to take pictures.  Our guest is from Peru, so he wanted pictures of everything here in the States to show his friends back home.

Cozumel's attention to detail, consistent food quality and speedy, friendly service will always win in my mind.  Overall, I definitely recommend Nuevo Acapulco for Mexican, but if you want tip top service and food EVERY time, Cozumel is the place for you.

{"text":"Decent salsa, large portions, and fast, friendly service adds up to four stars."}
{"text":"New restaurant working out the kinks but the positives will keep me coming back. Table side fresh made guacamole was excellent. Our food was hot and tasty!  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant! Worth making the trip from the east side. Have had several special occasions there and they are always accommodating for groups. My go to for birthdays and love when they put the sombrero on the birthday person and sing. Best margaritas in town and love getting the pitchers. Very fairly priced."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The only redeeming feature was the table side made guacamole.  Chicken tasted like it was canned."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated restaurant, great service, and amazing salsa. The food was impressive and very tasty. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Maybe you will know what to do with a 2 lb fajita burrito, but I don't.

This place is almost family style Mexican food, the Buca di Beppo of burritos if you will.  As normal human beings with normal sized stomachs, the dinner could have served us and the 2.5 kids that we don't have.  Which is great, unless you prefer smaller portions and better food. Upon closer inspection, my burrito was simply a bunch of food on a plate with a flour tortilla draped over top and tucked in on the sides. It could not be contained!

Now that's not to say the food is bad, because it's pretty good until the food coma sets in.  Let's break it down like it's some sort of game.  During warmup, you're a little intimidated by your opponent.  First quarter, you settle in and you have things under control.  Second quarter, the opponent fights back.  What happens in the second half? Not sure, because I got a doggy bag and forfeited.

Also, staff is friendly, they don't play music, it's loud, margaritas are a 6/10, and the chips and salsa are acceptable."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food!
 Service was very nice by this one lady with glasses.
The guy makes killer guacamole!"}
{"text":"Man I love this place. Love the look and feel as soon as I walk in the door. I also think the service is great. everyone is very nice and on top of anything i needed. I have ordered a few different dishes from here and have been amazed with each one. I would highly recommend the business to anyone. Well well worth a try."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants. I don't know how they only have 3.5 stars. The take out is made up the best  I've seen. They take two heavy duty throw away plates and wrap in foil and then secure with more foil. It's really considerate. Eating in the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"This place was definitely authentic Mexican,right down to the huge blue hat they tossed on my head while singing me happy birthday after my girlfriends friends husband told the waiter it was my birthday. Back to the matter at hand,I ordered the carne asada it was cooked to perfection and ready to eat. Everyone else loved their meals(and the free bday dessert,lol!) I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a good relaxed time and excellent food for a decent price."}
{"text":"I liked their food. Waitress was very accommodating to our large group, despite a slight language barrier. Friendly staff, and everything I tried was great! (The grilled chicken, guacamole, & a tamale a la carte) it looks tiny from the outside, but go inside!!! Beautiful Handpainted murals on the walls, and colorful details. Really feels like a trip to Mexico."}
{"text":"I had the Enchiladas de Verdura. I assumed it would have a nice assortment of veggies but it felt like it was something frozen. I could have gotten fresh veggies and made at home. I assumed the beans would be refried. They were whole beans in a small bowl. The wait staff was nice. Beautiful inside. Just think I expected more"}
{"text":"It was not super busy, our service was terrible and the food was not good. Especially compared to other Mexican restaurants nearby (fiesta jalepeno, el patron...) stay away from Antonio (server) and the queso fundido. He was very blah, at least pretend to care about what you are doing. No refills offered, took forever to take food order (only 4 adults and 2 kids) and food was just ok. I think Antonio should get back in the kitchen bc I don't think serving is his thing.  It was a very disappointing experience and we will not be back."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE:  Okay, I will get this out of the way first: yes, parking availability is horrible! I believe it's because it's shared with a no-name motel and the restaurant can be very busy on weekends. I have been here twice. The atmosphere is busy, the bar area is somewhat small, and separated from the dining room by a small secluded pass-thru where there are two very intimate booths. Perfect little \"hidaway\" spot for romantics. Otherwise, the dining room is huge. Lots of tables and booths along the wall. Honestly, sometimes it can get loud in the big dining room, especially with large families and/or parties.

SERVICE:  The service is very quick -- which can be good OR bad. On one occasion, my date and I just sat down and exchanged pleasantries, when the server came to take our drink order - which was placed. Then she returned in 2 minutes for a food order. I know she was trying to be efficient, but we felt rushed as she hovered over us as we studied the menu. Once we ordered -- the food came within 5-7 minutes! ... On this particular night, I guess the server was in a hurry to leave -- even though my date & I wanted to relax over dinner.. She dropped off the check after we'd only had a few bites of food, then she kept returning to see if my date had paid yet. I found that annoying and very unprofessional! Again, we felt rushed. 

FOOD & BEVERAGE:  Both times I've ordered Cadillac margaritas on the rocks with Grand Marnier on the side -- VERY potent and refreshing!! The drinks are not stingy or watered down, like so many local bars. 

The food is REAL -- let's call it, \"authentic-type\" Mexican food -- better than ANY chain Mexican place. Lots of rice & beans. The sizzling fajitas are fantastic. The chile rellenos are delectible & full of cheesy goodness. Chips & salsa are plentiful and a great starter... Unfortunately, I never have room for dessert. Although one of these days I will have to try the fried coconut ice cream!! I always leave with appetite satisfied -- and a doggy bag! :)

RESULT:  All in all, the food is plentiful & tasty. The drinks are fantastic! The atmosphere is nice & Mexico adobe themed. The service is pleasant, but seemed rushed and overly attentive."}
