{"text":"My family and I ate here just before my flight at Air Combat Zone which is next door. The staff is very friendly and the food is fresh and delicious. The gyros I had one one of the best I've ever tasted. Very moist and flavorful. We also had the Greek salad and chicken parmesan, which was very good. Prices were also very reasonable for the quality.  My only suggestion to the owners would be to put a menu up on the wall so customers have an idea of what's available without having to ask.. The name is also bit misleading because while they do sell grocery and bakery items, food and coffee seems to be the main focus."}
{"text":"Awesome place, owners are super friendly. Good food, good portions. He cycles Keanu option above and beyond the staple items. If he has the lemon chicken, get the dinner plate. I'm a fan of the spicy tzatziki and village salad."}
{"text":"Owner was nice but the Food wasn't fresh.. I was expecting better based on the rating.  I wouldn't recommend as my take out meal ended up in the garbage. Rice = Bland Meat combo (Lamb,chicken,Pork) must have been sitting for hours Best part of the meal was the Salad...."}
{"text":"Tasty healthy food, friendly owner, cozy environment.  We all had the salad with chicken / beef + lamb / pork. Was quite filling and we all enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"First time to this place and I will be going back. The selection was large and reasonably priced. The portion size was fantastic for what you paid and the food tasted amazing. Very satisfied and look forward to becoming a regular :) I bought some Baklava to bring home and my husband said it was the best he has had in a long time."}
{"text":"Overpriced and very cold food. Will not recommend this place to anyone. Also they put cold fries instead of potatoes instead. Seemed like the fries were made hours ago. The chicken souvlaki was also very cold and bland. Was not fresh at all. Was also over charged. They state a diff price outside and once you eat they rip you off. Very shady business."}
{"text":"Ok, for sure 100% Greek Hellenic food. Keep up the good job guys.... coming back soon...   from Iceland"}
{"text":"Hidden gem alert!  Welcome to the home of the best souvlaki in town...and one my favorite lunch options in the city. For about $10-12 you can get a great homely meal including a hearty salad (try the village salad...it's actually good even if you don't like salady stuff), rice, lemon potatoes and your choice of chicken, pork or lamb souvlaki or gyro meat. They got three types of tszitki sauce to wash down your meal with n they're all D-licious.   It's a hot table setup with those staples as well as some random specials like fish, lasagne, chicken parm, etc. I routinely stare at everything carefully but always go back to the tried, tested and true classic - chicken souvlaki plate.   This place also goes by the name Keepin' it Greek and they also serve halal chicken but do not have certificate on display.   For the price, your not gonna find many meals this good. Worth a visit...particularly is you work close by."}
{"text":"Such a cute place to eat. Good food. Try their salad and fresh meat. Very attentive staff. Clean, cool. What more could you ask for?"}
