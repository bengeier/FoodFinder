{"text":"Free spring rolls on the house she said as she sat them on the table.  Very friendly staff an I feel welcome even as a single diner.  I ordered the cashew chicken mild you have the option of getting it spicy spicy if you chose.  Well they brought out catfish instead of chicken.  I tried it wasn't bad but I would not be the person to order fish.  Another waitress noticed it was wrong an went an re-ordered the chicken for me.  I would suggest maybe pointing to the menu when you order.  Cashew chicken arrived undercooked veggies maybe they rushed it after getting the wrong order the first time. She didn't bring any plates so I could eat on this time.  Clearly she is mad because of the wrong order.  Kind of an attitude when she brought the chicken out.  Asked for a Togo box I can go home an finish cooking it.  Very disappointed in my first time here.  At home now finishing the cooking myself."}
{"text":"First visit to Thai Cuisine (interesting name, no?) and first visit to Pittsburgh, so that should set up this review nicely. Context is, of course, that I expected very little from this town, yet I've been completely surprised. #1 - faux meat on a menu is a huge plus for me, I just love it, and I don't care to hear comments like \"if you are a vegetarian, why would you eat something that is meant to taste and look like meat?\" Shut up. I just like it. #2 - the prices are so cheap. I only looked at the vegetarian menu where every entree is about $10 for dinner, and while that's no steal nor does it compare to Thai food prices in Thailand, it's decent. #3 - cutest. waitress. ever. AND she mentioned that \"all of my cool friends have read that book\" which, by default, makes me a cool kid? Hmmm. Maybe. Then again, maybe not."}
{"text":"Ever since they've opened, I've been a regular here. In the past year I haven't been able to come as often because I moved to the other side of the city, but still dine occasionally and take out since my parents' house is close by. I'm writing this review because my last visit was not as pleasant. My boyfriend and I were craving thai food and since we were going to this side of town, I suggested and was excited to eat here. The Pad See Ewe is my favorite dish and I ALWAYS order it. This time the vegetables tasted burnt, noodles were overcooked, and the dish overall was a little bland. It was the very first time I've ever complained about a dish here. Since I also work in the restaurant industry, I like to avoid making employees feel uncomfortable by complaining, but I just didn't want to pay for something I wasn't going to eat. I asked the server to take the dish back in the nicest way possible. Then the owner comes out a couple minutes later saying they tasted it in the back and there's nothing wrong with the dish. We explained we're regulars and it usually tastes amazing and it wasn't the same this time, but she went on to say there's nothing wrong with the dish (basically called us liars) and told us if we don't like it, not to order it next time.. The worst part was when I told her I was a regular, she said she recognizes me but still decided to treat us the way she did. This experience was so disappointing only because I used to love coming here and I actually admired the owner because she was always so nice and hardworking. I decided to give 3 stars because I figured it wouldn't be fair to give them just 1 since I've enjoyed so much of their food until now. Their food is delicious (most of the time). I just want to warn you not to complain about the food unless you're ready to be treated like a criminal. I really hope that they change the way they handle complaints."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas. Everything on the menu is so good that you can close your eyes and point, and you cannot go wrong. If you enjoy the traditional Thai dishes done right, then this is the place for you! The staff is fun, friendly and so attentive. I always look forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"SO delicious and such a beautiful restaurant. And BYOB! Loved the pulled pork buns and the spicy noodle. Yum yum"}
{"text":"Very much just a small great place to eat.  Everything I've had here is great and I try new things all the time.  My wife loves the Pad Se Ew with extra chinese broccolli  and the vegetable rolls.  The Tom Kha Kai is the creamiest that you'll ever find, Red Curry, Spicy Beef Salad, Silver Noodle Salad, Rad Na, Papaya Salad, Thai Beef Jerky, Curry Fried Rice, Seafood and Fish Dishes, they are all awesome.  If you don't mind the humble surroundings and just want great Thai food be sure to try it out when you are on the East side."}
{"text":"Checked out the FREE delivery and very impressed. The food arrived hot and delicious. The appetizer combo was delicious and was the items were crispy.  Combination fried rice was full of meat and shrimp and egg and goodness. I tried the vegetable tom kha and was very pleased. Yes, we will order again."}
{"text":"Delicious-- try the spicy basil noodles.  Really relaxed atmosphere, nice low lighting, friendly staff.  Your water glass will never get more than a third empty!  

Oh, sometimes I really miss Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I always thought I hated Thai food, but it turns out I just hadn't tried good Thai food!  Thai Cuisine is easily my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh right now.  As others say, try the curries; they're absolutely delicious.  Their mock duck and \"veggie chicken ham\" (it really does taste like chicken and ham simultaneously) are very tasty, and a welcome addition to the menu.  And speaking of the menu, Thai Cuisine offers an entire vegetarian menu!

Also, the service here is perfect.  Really.  The servers are incredible."}
{"text":"good authentic thai food

excellent thai basil chicken fried rice

friendly service

i didn't like the thai tea"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai we've had!  Awesome flavors, large menu, wonderful service - will return often and recommend this restaurant to our friends and family."}
{"text":"This is the only place we will go now for Thai food in Pittsburgh.  It's consistent, tasty and the specials keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Bummer. Closed until the end of January 2012 for renovations."}
{"text":"This restaurant is as close to the Thai food I experienced whilst traveling through Thailand.  The flavors are fabulous, the atmosphere and decor lovely.  Lisa, her family and staff do a wonderful job!
I recommend the Panang curry, larb salad, fresh spring rolls and sticky black pudding, to name only a few!"}
{"text":"Good food -- meaning they know how to cook delicious and flavorful food. Most important thing."}
{"text":"This used to be my best place.  Something has changed and not for the better.  Last time I ordered from here someone put a ton of tumeric in white rice with some obvious frozen peas and carrots and few pieces of meat, tried to pass that off like it was fried rice.  

But this time, I won't order until things change.  The Pad Thai is a cheap imitation with a few sprinkles of pepper flakes.  The shrimp is so over cooked it's gross.  The wontons were not cooked right and the mystery meat in the middle is still pink.  Used to be able to choose what went inside.  The only saving grace was the orange chicken sauce.  Very slightly sweet and a small tang.  Otherwise the chicken was dry and tasted like it was microwaved.  The BBQ shrimp were not BBQ'd at all.  The shrimp was very greasy but not under cooked. Guess why? Because in the ordering comments I asked them not to over cook the shrimp.  Go figure.

Not sure what happened to this place: new management, short cuts, unhappy cooks or staff members, or just being cheap with ingredients.  Whatever the problem is it is coming out in the food.  Very poor quality for what \"used\" to be a great place for Thai food."}
{"text":"Very satisfying place to be at . Food is very good . The pad Thai is one of the best I've ever had . Service is great and clean place to eat. Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone . Thai cuisine rocks"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai Restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The building may not look like much, but the food is excellent.  The only dish I have ever disliked was the duck curry.  Everything else has been superb. The prices are reasonable and the servers are friendly, too.  It often gets quite crowded on weekends, but the wait is never too long.  BYOB."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best green curry dish around the Pittsburgh area!!!  It literally cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"This place is aces for dinner. I've never been at lunchtime but have always been impressed with their dinner service. They're always busy but manage to have a swift table turnover. The BYOB/W makes it even better. It's nice to be able to bring my own and splurge on dessert.

I have the massaman curry pretty frequently. I also love the tom kha chicken soup."}
{"text":"My husband and i absolutely love this place! We have ordered quite a few items and have always been happy-we have also acquired some favorites like their fried rice-orange chicken and any appetizer! Their food is always hot and fresh when we get it (we tend to order delivery) the staff is super friendly and the food is never greasy and portions are plentiful-we always have leftovers and the food re-heats great! No 'food coma' either lol. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I must write a review for this restaurant!  :)

I have lived in Pittsburgh for almost 8 years now and luckily found this Thai restaurant early in my move.  Let me start with a little story.  My sister lived in Northern California and was visiting.  We were talking about places to eat and I of course mentioned and suggested Thai Cuisine, knowing how good their food is.  My sister was skeptical, to say the least, mentioning in the same breath that she lives in the San Francisco area, could a place in Pittsburgh actually be that good if not better than restaurants in CA?  I decided to let the food speak for itself  --- and it did!  My sister ordered the red curry (duck with pineapple), her fave dish, and she LOVED it.  In fact, she admitted after that this restaurant was indeed the best she had had - and that it was too bad that it was in Pittsburgh.  

Me personally?  I love the green curry with mock duck (wheat gluten) - and I am not vegan or vegetarian.  I would like to mention that this restaurant has a nice selection of vegetarian and vegan options.  The crispy spring rolls are yummy, especially with the sauce.  The soups are all pretty great.  

You should try this restaurant, it will definitely be worth your time.  And if you like your food spicy, like I do, make sure you tell them you want it thai spicey at 10 out of 10!  :)"}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine is my go-to restaurant here in Pittsburgh. I didn't discover it until I had lived in Pittsburgh for almost a year, but since then, my friends and I have been going almost weekly--I think it's becoming an addiction.

They have a good number of tables and a couple of booths, so seating has never been an issue, even when we're with a larger group. The staff are friendly and incredibly attentive; I don't think I've ever had a glass of water that was less than three-quarters full. The food arrives at your table less than 10 minutes after the waiter takes your order. Their spice levels are pretty on point and range from 1-10, but you can always ask for the spice rack if you need an extra kick. I've tried almost all their noodle dishes and a handful of the curries and nothing has disappointed. They make one of the best Pad Thais I've ever eaten. They also have specials that are ever rotating, which makes it nice if you're looking to try something new. In general, everything is flavorful and you get what you order. Portions are sufficient for a solid meal and very reasonably priced.

I might venture and say that this is one of the best Thai places in Pittsburgh, but I know that's highly debated here. I'll just say that it's one of the most reliable Thai places I've ever gone to and I'm happy to frequent it regularly."}
{"text":"My favorite for Thai and how authentic- great service!
No matter what you order you will say \"I can't wait return and try something new 
Spring Rolla and Summer Rolls are to die for"}
{"text":"This place exceeded all expectation. Great customer service and outstanding quality food. Will go back whenever in town. My son goes to Pitt and took a friend there already. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decent. .not the greatest thai food.  Ordered coconut soup on line.. they gave me something else?! Okay..?! .
Check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Been back several times and it's still our favorite Thai in Pittsburgh. The pad Thai is very good, with a slight smoky flavor that keeps you coming back for more. It's a light pad this, not thick and gloopy, so your friends who only know to eat the pad Thai (assuming you have such friends) won't feel overloaded by their dinner. 

I now know not to eat green curry anywhere else! Did that recently on a trip to England and was bummed."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh for over 10 years.  The service is always friendly.  Lisa, who usually greets you when you walk in, is incredibly nice and accommodating.  The food is the best Thai I've had in the city.  There are a few dishes that I really like at Nicki's and Senyai, but overall, Thai Cuisine wins.  My favorite dishes are Spicy Noodles and Green Curry.  It's enough food that you can take some home.  Morning after breakfast is leftover Thai Cuisine curry.  I can't manage to save it til lunchtime."}
{"text":"i was very excited to try this place.  thai is one of my favorite cuisines ever!!!  but i was sorrily disappointed. we started with spring rolls, through the rice wrapper i could see that the lettuce was browning, a sure sign that the rolls were not made to order.  the pad thai was dry and tasteless.  my friends curry and potatoes tasted like water with a touch of curry powder.  i hate giving poor reviews but nothing that i ate at thai cuisine was yummy."}
{"text":"I have tried the curries and the fried rice dishes and they are all very good. 

tip: it's BYOB
the spiciness is from 0-10. go higher for the noodle dishes."}
{"text":"This is the only Thai I've had so I might just be reviewing Thai food generally as being good, but I couldn't imagine asking more out of this restaurant. The tables and seating look much nicer than the price, which was under $10 for me I believe for just a curry/meat/rice bowl, which was more than filling. My dad ordered the same thing and asked for \"9\" spiciness, but did not think it was spicy at all. I asked for \"5\" not really sure what the scale meant and it did not taste remotely spicy (which was fine).

We've gone a second time and both got the same thing as the first. Don't mess with a good thing, I guess!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  We ate here several times and everything was very good.  Good service, clean place, and the noodles..."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite places to eat!  I have been here almost every week for the past couple months.  The food is delicious.  The service is fantastic & friendly. The atmosphere is very pleasant.

Recommended: The curry.  The green is good, and the yellow is to die for.

They have a pretty big menu, along with a separate vegetarian one.  The prices are very reasonable.  No alcohol here, but it's BYOB (only $1 a glass if you bring a bottle of wine).  

I really can't imagine finding better Thai food in Pittsburgh, or anywhere for that matter -- YUM."}
{"text":"Very good food ! Excellent customer service. Ordered the chicken pad thai and the chicken spicy noodle. Overall, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best curries in Pittsburgh and possibly the best curries I've ever had.  Noodle dishes and appetizers are good, but the curries are the main attraction.   Definitely one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Would rather eat here than anywhere else in the world. Green curry. Pad Thai. Yum yum yum yum yum. 5 Yums on the yum scale. And addictive."}
{"text":"Excellent.  My wife and I had a great meal there last night.  Friendly staff and great food.  In fact the Pad Thai was so good, we ordered some to go."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this restaurant for well over 10 years, and the food is very good! The people who work there are very nice and always try to make sure you are satisfied. I would highly recommend them, but if you order online, don't use Eat24, just call the restaurant yourself and order on the phone."}
{"text":"Food was great! Taste was on point . Delivery was maybe 10 min late but no big deal. I was still amazed that they had delivery as an option in the east side of town. Definitely ordering in again. You guys made my lazy Sunday :) 

Crab rangoons were soooo good. !!
Medium spicy has a nice kick to it I wonder what hot is like. Every order was good size sharable portions."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall restaurant that introduced me to the awesomeness that is Thai food some years ago when I lived in Shadyside. Ended up biking over for takeout once every week or 2.

Living in CA now and haven't been back in about 4 years, and have a fantastic Thai restaurant on my corner, but I still miss Thai Cuisine. The food was great and the staff treated me very well as a regular. Decor and ambiance...lacked a bit but were in line with the prices and the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to Thai Cuisine for many years now even though it's almost a 2.5 hours drive from our house (round trip). We both love Thai food and Thai Cuisine is still the best we've ever had (2nd best so far is in Virginia Beach, VA).

Their Pad See Ew, Three Flavor Chicken, and Thai Spring Rolls are our regular favorites. We also love having their Mango Sticky Rice for desert when it is in season."}
{"text":"Of the many, many good things that come with living in Bloomfield, Thai Cuisine tops the list. I've only ordered take out, but the service has always been above par. The place is BYOB, which means you can have a fancy meal on the cheap. They have a great veg menu, it's not over saturated with fake meat, or light on the protein. Their menu strikes a great vegetable/protein balance for non-meat eaters, and it looks like it does the same for omnivores.

The price is great too, you can get plenty of food for about $10 per person (not including tip or drinks)"}
{"text":"Entrees were very good, but the soup and egg roll were at least a day old. I'm sure it's a great place when there are actual customers, but the lack of patronage seems to have made them a little lazy."}
{"text":"My favorite go to for thai comfort food! The staff is always friendly, the food is always hot and prepared exactly the way I ask for it. I'm a lover of very hot food and the spicey basils never dissapoint me. The curry is wonderful and the desserts are perfect. Top off with jasmine tea and add a talkative friend to create the perfect lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love this place. We would recommend it to anyone, and everything we try  is great. Why are the egg rolls sooooo good? :)"}
{"text":"I always, without fail, order the Green Curry. It is so, so, so good."}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine is the BEST Thai in town!  Hands down.  I've visited most of the other thai places in town (Nicky's Thai Kitchen, Bangcock Balcony, Thai Gourmet, Thai Me Up, Thai Place (fox chapel and shadyside) and they are all inferior to thai cuisine in bloomfield.  Thai cuisine's curries are always sublime.  As my husband said, their curries are like \"a party in my mouth\".  The flavors are sublimely mixed, like perfect artistry.  
Since it open over 10 years ago, I have been a fan.  I know them on a first name basis as I've been going there for their curry for so long.  Their noodle dishes are good, but the curry is where they surpass everyone in town.  

PS I still have to try \"the Smiling Banana Leaf\", but I'm always so disappointed by the amount of fish sauce in all of the other curries in town that I can't take trying out new thai places in town anymore.  None of them compare. 

I am the poster child for this place and I tell everyone who comes to Pittsburgh, who will listen, that they must get there asap."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this gem in the east side, boy am I glad he did. Great spot for lunch deals and every lunch special comes with soup and egg rolls. Definitely a must try place"}
{"text":"We loved our meal and portions are so large we have lots left over to enjoy tomorrow.  To start with, we ordered delivery and it was so easy and fast.
The free spring rolls that came with the order were hot crispy and delicious.  
Then we had the war wonton soup piping hot and chock full of all the tasty chicken shrimp and veggies.  The wontons were really meaty filled and very tasty tender seasoned real good.  The crab Rangoon were huge and stuffed full of crab like no others I have ever had.  really rich and I could only eat one, they are substantial. 
my entree was the Green curry chicken and it was exceptional.  Reflect amount of heat in the curry sauce, veggies tasted fresh picked and it was loaded to the hilt with tender chicken.  
Moms entree was chicken moo goo gai pan 
and she said it was tasty.  
The rice was fresh and we had plenty. 
Glad to have this authentic Thai nearby that delivers.  
I recommend!  Price is right considering huge portions, fresh taste fast delivery."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places around Pittsburgh to eat! A little on the pricey side, but the food is consistently excellent. I especially love the peanut chicken satay appetizer and the red curry entrees. Our waitress has always been friendly and is very knowledgeable about the menu. The rotating dessert menu is usually pretty tasty, too. Atmosphere is quiet--a nice date location. Service is prompt but never rushed."}
{"text":"Delicious Tofu and Veggie Thai Fried Rice, Friendly Waitresses and on point spice level. Crab Rangoon was yummy with good portions. Good value as well. Would return! Also really pleased that they have good veggie options with a separate menu for Vegetarian choices, more restaurants should practice this!"}
{"text":"I just went to Thai Cuisine for the first time since it was updated last week and boy has it changed for the better. The decor and space was a tad dingy and dated before. Now its clean and modern. Large decorative shades flow from the ceiling and tasteful artwork hangs on the walls. Even the flatware has been updated. It immediately felt cozier.

Now the big test: did the food get updated?

I rarely stray from the Chicken Pad Thai here so naturally it was an easy choice. It came out steaming. So hot in fact I couldn't even take an immediate bite and I have a metal mouth.

I'm happy to report after it cooled down that the dish had been prepared to match the new look and feel of Thai Cuisine. The sauce was tangy. The bean sprouts were crispy. And the chicken was sliced and cooked to perfection. The dish was drastically better than the last time I had Pad Thai here.

Now Thai Cuisine may not be my all-time favorite Thai food in Pittsburgh but this experience has most certainly put it back in the running.

Welcome back Thai Cuisine."}
{"text":"never had a bad experience until i ordered take out lately, but still pretty solid."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  Everything was so flavorful and cooked perfectly.  Ordered the yellow curry vegetarian and the spring rolls... Great prices and even better food. Showed up on time with everything i needed, plenty of sauce, napkins, plastic ware....  I'll be ordering again soon....."}
{"text":"blandest thai food in pittsburgh I think.  You could really just walk down a few blocks and spend less for better food.  I think the only people that like the food are vegatarians since they have fake meats.  Their sauces literally are all the same, their curries are bad, and everything is way more expensive than it should be.  Their new facade is ugly as can be too.  It looks like someone used some old floor tile from a kitchen and used it as brick for the front of the building.  Looked way better before.
D-"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here you are missing out on some serious flavor. The food cooked here is amazing!! And the price is really affordable compared to other places. Feeling lazy? Thy got free delivery! Lunch specials are great don't just take my word for it stop by and have at it"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas! Really good service! Cheap to dine in! And will definitely be back! Shrimp chow main, tried the soup, had Spicy mint beef! Everything was Bomb!"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time after great reviews. Got pretty sick from the Hawaiian fried rice. So much so I should have gone to the er. Clearly, it was food poisoning. Had all of the symptoms,  it did pass after 24hrs, Contacted them, just to alert them to check their food, however still have not received a return phone call."}
{"text":"The first time I went there they had the cutest little lady who knew my fiance well. He has been dining there for lunch for years. She was so welcoming. She even gave us free won-tons and soup as we waited for our food. The pad thai is DELISH! My favorite is the spicy mint chicken. Get ready to break a sweat but goodness it is worth it. Their Thai tea is extremely good as well. I have yet to not enjoy their food! We feel like regulars when we do go."}
{"text":"My Husband and I have made a Sunday tradition of Mass and Thai over in Bloomfield.  We always make it a point to pick and try one of their specials.  We have never been disappointed, in fact, we asked the waitress what certain new ingredients are and they have always been very educated on the menu.  The server even enlightened us that the chef and cooks go to the strip district each week and compile all their ingredients.  We recommend any of their curry specials, for example \"Thai pumpkin, lychee, fried fish, etc\".  Also, if you want to try something unique which is sometimes not listed on the menu, ask for the Thai pierogi (Most likely not called that but they'll know what you mean). It's a pillow of potato and Thai spices that bring joy to your mouth and sensations. Also, BYOB :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by last night after a long work week. My husband and I have been coming here for over 4 years, while enjoying our coconut chicken soup which was , as always, spiced just right and nice and hot, I was trying to recall, how and when did I discover this palate-pleasing place. I finally figured I have been coming here for over 10 years, my family has eaten here with me, my friends and now my husband, the secret to this place: Food is always better than the last time. It never disappoints and for the price, really? I have grown close to some of the people that work there, and they make it a point to always say hello and come out and greet us.The panang is by far really hard to beat, the mint pork.....finger-licking-good, and of course I can not eat here without the chicken pad thai.....I could go on for days.
The music, the people and of course the quality of the food, all make it a favorite for us."}
{"text":"This place is great! The service is amazing. The seafood soup is so delicious. The music is fun. I am sure I will come back very soon."}
{"text":"I've had better Thai food, but curry was very tasty (had the Red Bean Curry). Red flag when we were served generic green tea (bag) in diner style mugs?!? & charged $2 for a 6oz mug of hit water?!! Green Tea should be served in a tea pot & cups (not mugs). Prefer the other Thai place 2 blocks away - more authentic!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pad Thai and drunken noodles. At least better than Thai Gourmet and within walking distance of Children's Hospital."}
{"text":"Might get a higher rating for their regular meals, but the lunch special left much to be desired. Free egg rolls a plus, but the free soup was super salty! We were looking for a Thai experience. The chicken with vegetables just tasted like Chinese take out and although still edible, the curry was probably one of the weakest I've ever eaten. Good deal if you want cheap Chinese lunch. Go somewhere else if you want good Thai food. Service was great. The ladies were really nice."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Lovely little mom and pop place. The owner always recognizes you and remembers your order. They've got large portions at great prices. During the week they've got incredible lunch specials along with unlimited spring egg rolls. I always get either their Pad Thai Chicken or Pad See Ew Chicken, and it's amazing."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Thai Cuisine many times. The consistency is always good. The restaurant is very clean and comfortable. 

I had the vegetarian eggplant dish with brown rice. They are very accommodating for special requests such as, no mushrooms, and extra broccoli. I asked for it to be spicey, 9/10, and it was perfect. The garlic sauce was wonderful, and the food was not greasy at all (as it is sometimes in Thai restaurants).

My friend had Spicy Basils (have no idea why it is plural) with Chicken and she loved it. 

It's a BYOB place."}
{"text":"I heart Thai Cuisine! Ryan B. and I always go there for our Thai fix! We ordered the Tom Yum shrimp soup, which was so flavorful and hearty, as well as the Won Ton soup, which was a million times more flavorful than what you'd find in the typical Chinese restaurant. 

Our entrees are typically Winter Curry, which Ryan B. LOVES, and Cashew Chicken, which is spicy and delicious. 


Be sure to BYOB, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent,  and the food was brought out quickly.  We ordered fried rice, pad see eaw, dumplings,  and ragoons.  The ragoons were cooked to perfection but the filling was 95% crab\5% cream cheese,  and the pad see eaw was a little bland.  The fried rice and dumplings were excellent.   Portions were a great size as well."}
{"text":"My vote for Best Thai in Pittsburgh.  I've tried them all and I keep going back to Thai Cuisine.  Space was completely remodeled a couple months ago.  Hostess/owner is incredibly friendly as are the wait staff.  Get the Green Curry!  My favorite.  Recently had Red Curry with Beef.  Very good as well."}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine is not the place to go if you're looking for ambiance, but the food is great. I went for lunch last week and had Yellow Curry with chicken, which was among the best yellow curries I've ever had. All my meals there have been delicious. The recent lunch service was a little slow -- but they were pretty busy."}
{"text":"This place is great! I got lost trying to find it but so glad I didn't give up. Their Pad Thai is a bit more expensive than what I'm used to, but totally worth it. The staff is so friendly and best of all...they deliver!"}
{"text":"Absolutely BEST Thai in PGH. After moving to Pittsburgh from LA at the beginning of 2015 my fiance and I hunted for a Thai place that could compare w/ our favorite place that we left behind. This spot is by far the best tasting, best service in the city. we go often and have never had a meal we didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Not the best Thai food, but not bad and it is the best in the neighborhood, much better flavor-wise than the other couple Thai restaurants.  I have not tried a huge variety, but the noodle dishes and curries so far have been good.  Fine quality meat, good protein/veggie ratio and flavorful sauces with the correct thickness.  The fresh spring roll is different than what I am used to and probably would not order again."}
{"text":"Well we ordered from an online company and the order was confirmed. An hour later I called no one answered. I emailed the online company who I ordered from and they too did not get ahold of them. My order had to be cancelled because nobody answered the phone. Got my money back and for my inconvenience I was awarded $15 for my next order online. 
I still craved Thai food and ordered from another place. This place answers their phone and delivered my food pretty much on time. 
BEWARE IF YOU ORDER ONLINE, YOU MIGHT GO HUNGRY IF THIS PLACE DECIDES NOT TO ANSWER THE PHONE EVEN IF THEY ACCEPT YOUR ORDER ONLINE!!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  We dine here at least twice a month and love it. The Pad Thai and bamboo shoot curry are both amazing! I love that they have a spicy scale and you can choose your spice level on any dish."}
{"text":"Not much to say but I like this place. The Thai style fried rice with crab or lobster meat is pretty good. Service is ok and ambiance is good."}
{"text":"Very friendly family owned restaurant .. food is excellent.. love the complimentary egg rolls , rangoons are to die for"}
{"text":"Get the Panang Curry Chicken, it'll change your life! Place is very clean, the service is very good and the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"Delicious, Affordable, Great Menu, Friendly Service!  One of my favorite Thai restaurants in the area.  I suggest the 'Bird's Nest' entree.  Newly remodeled and very nice looking!  The food is not very spicy, so if you desire SPICY, you have to ask for it!"}
{"text":"When it is a late night dinner, both my husband and I know there is only one place we will be ordering from.  Thai Cuisine has some of the most amazing Asian food,  my favorite is the pineapple rice, and the pot stickers.  My husband likes anything really hot, and their chicken wings.  You must try the place if you haven't already.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

 Note*  Do not order lunch, it came cold, and without the soup they advertise.  The lunch combo's tasted like it came from  an all you can eat buffet !  LUNCH NEVER AGAIN RIP OFF AFTER THIS IT WILL BE AWHILE BEFORE I RETURN FOR DINNER!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant. I love their chicken fried rice. Me and my family have been coming here for the last 5 - 7 years. The owner always greets us and make us feel like we're at home."}
{"text":"Just want to say \"Yum! Yum!\", & So Far -- So good!"}
{"text":"Since the remodel of Jan 2012, gone is the quit peacefullness & the wonderful table settings. This place is much too loud now, & it gets so annoying it sounds like a daycare. Couldn't wait to leave. Food was good as it ever was though, but lack of carpeting & the old dropped ceiling really took away the quiet & romantic charm that the old place had. Lisa, add some carpet & heavy tapestries from the ceiling to kill the noise and I'll be back...... Whose design idea was this anyways? UPDATE: it's long overdue, but they did add sound deadening material, which seems to help. The food is fabulous as it was when they opened years ago. This is our go to Thai place, definitely worth the drive from the north hills."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has very few good Thai resturants. I ordered here for delivery. It was the best delivery I found in my area for good Pad Se Ew. They only have delivery through Wheel Deliver , which makes it too expensive really to order ofter(would have been five stars if not for the outragious fees to order via wheel deliver). But the food was so dang good! So go in and takeout or sit down."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. Great food. 

My family and I went along with my 14 month old daughter. They had no problem making a special meal just for my daughter because she can't have adult food yet. 

When the adult food came out it was delicious! I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Pittsburgh, hands down. My go-to Tuesday night takeout spot.

Pad thai and massaman curry are definitely highlights. Red curry has pineapple, which I personally dislike. Avoid the thai fried rice--it's good but really overpriced. 

The spice levels are made for white people so feel free to venture into the higher numbers. I usually go about an 8 or 9. 

Mostly a take-out place although it can get busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Las Vegas for our 25th anniversary and had a serious Thai food craving.  We arrived at 10:50 and on a Tuesday and were the first customers there (Lot's of people started filing in about 15 minutes later).

You have probably read how friendly the staff is and I concur.  The staff are actually from Thailand where I have vacationed and dwell the friendliest people on the planet!  Our server greeted us with a smile and asked us to choose our desired \"heat\" level on a scale of 1 to 10.  My wife who can handle spicy food chose 5 and she would only allow me to choose 4.

I ordered the garlic beef and was utterly pleased with the flavor.  It was just so delicious and satisfying with a nice portion of food.  I had mine with the fried rice after enjoying the delicious soup of lemongrass, tomatoes and lean chicken.  

My wife ordered the chicken curry which was so coconut rich and authentic.  Her heat level of 5 would have been at my max level of enjoyable \"heat\".  We both said that if this was a 5 GOD help anyone who chose a 10 level.

Wonderful experience.  The price was phenomenal...$7 for the lunch special.  I wish it was closer since we are staying at the MGM Grand Signature.  We just happened to be visiting the Air Force base."}
{"text":"Spicy shrimp soup seafood soup , yellow curry rice crab rice, crab ragoons and spring rolls are wonderful.  Did not like Mongolian beef or szechwuan chicken which are usually my fave at other places. Great staff very friendly service oriented.  This is a Family owned restaurant. They always remember my fiance and I."}
{"text":"We landed here thanks to Yelp reviews. Great little place is like a hidden gem. Food was great and service was just fantastic. We plan to return soon. Portions are large and price is reasonable. We tried both appetizers and main dishes which turned out to be delicious. We tried chicken dumplings, satay, Hawaiian fried rice and hot pot. Everything turned out good. There Is ample paid street parking. So next time, we desire for Thai food, we know where to go."}
{"text":"well i finally took the advice of fellow yelpers and gave Thai Cuisine a shot last weekend.   I showed up at 930 on Friday night and the place was packed.  I had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  I always feel waiting for a table is more of a positive than a negative as it usually means good things are to come.  I started out with the special shrimp fried in wontons.  It was unmemorable and I would of like to have seen bigger shrimp for this 6.95 appetizer.  I ordered the vegetable tom yum soup.  This was outstanding.  The vegetables were large and fresh and the spice was perfect.  I asked for medium and actually got medium.  I went with the standard pineapple curry as i always do the first time at a thai place.  Every bite was enjoyable and again the medium spice was perfect.  Like so often at thai restaurants i am always sad when i get to the bottom of the bowl.    Looking forward to my next visit. (4.5 stars)"}
{"text":"This place is great, we as a family went to the restaurant to celebrate a graduation.  I yelped Thai food and realized this place was close and had great reviews.  I got the curry tofu and it was great, the spring rolls where awesome too.  I also had some of the Pad Thai and the drunken Noodles both as good as the first."}
{"text":"This place is a mixture of Chinese & Thai food.

It's quiet and service was good.

We tried a bit of everything, sorry no pictures too hungry to stop and snap a picture of the spread.

We ordered the Tofu Pad Thai, Chicken Penang Curry, papaya salad, Shrimp Chow Mein, Shrimp Fried Rice, Pork Noodle Soup, Chinese Broccoli w/ Crispy pork and Fried Tilapia.

The Crispy pork gets soggy w/ the sauce they add to the dish.  Maybe recommend less sauce or pork on the side to keep it Crispy. 

The Fried Tilapia is served w/ the sauce on the side. 

The wait staff came by a few times to make sure we had everything and to refill our drinks.
 
Will definitely come to this spot again when we're in town visiting family."}
{"text":"This is the best asian food place I have tried in Las Vegas. I'm a 28 year resident in the Las Vegas area and have seen many places come and go. Their shrimp fried rice is especially delicious. Love, love, love this place and it's super friendly staff.

**UPDATE** 
This place went to shit. Must be new management. The prices went up and the quality went down. A slap in the face for somebody who has been coming here since... it's been so many years I don't even know anymore. At least 15 years. ByeBye Thai Cuisine restaurant. It was good while it lasted."}
{"text":"I have been going here for almost five years. The food is great. I always get the tum yum, perfect balance in the taste. You get to pick the levels of spiciness. The chow main is ten times better than Panda's. Service is nothing special but always nice staff."}
{"text":"This place is to die for...way better then those places in Chinatown...the service is great I think it's ran by a family not sure but they give you attention when needed and let you enjoy your meal

I had the Spicy Beef Salad, let me tell you it was beyond delicious that I ordered another one to go to have for lunch the next daytime portion size is perfect and the price is not bad at all...to bad I live on the west side of Las Vegas or else I would be here once or twice a wk...will make it a mission to stop by whenever I am on the east side of town! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't found Thai food that blew me away in Pittsburgh, but the waiter here was incredibly friendly, and my mock duck dish was solidly tasty."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I had their weekday buffet lunch about eight years ago and I wasn't impressed.  Either they shot the chef at that time, or they decided to start serving authentic Thai food, I don't know.  Either way, they deliver seriously good Thai food through eat24hours.com.  I think I've mentioned before that I spend quite a bit of time in Thailand, and I really love Thai food; HOT Thai food; AUTHENTIC Thai food.  This time, we ordered Pahd See Ew Gai (chicken noodles), Khao Pahd Gai (chicken fried rice), red chicken curry, and papaya salad with sticky rice.  Foodgasm!  The fried rice and noodles are going to be lunch next week, the rest will be gone by tomorrow.

If you live on the east side and are too lazy/tired/drunk to get to Pon Ocha Soup, get on eat24hours.com and order from this place."}
{"text":"My family has been going here since I was little, the owner is very friendly. The place is always clean if you go for lunch it's free soup and egg rolls, the lunch specials are portion appropriately with your choice of white or fried rice and I think noodles? Haven't gotten anything like that in a while I always get the curry it's just like my grandma's you get to choose your spice level 1-10 which are true to spice lol. I also get the Thai coffee which is something I can't find everywhere. I highly recommend this place if you want some good Thai food at a good price with personable people"}
{"text":"Very tasty! One of the best Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh.  They offer an entire vegetarian menu and most dishes can be made vegan, they even have mock-meat options! Staff was very accommodating of our dietary restrictions!"}
{"text":"Tried ordering on eat24 and it would not take my order because I was 5.5 miles away. I called the restaurant to check if they would make an exception and they said they would. I was quoted a 45 min delivery time and they showed up in less than 30 mins! I was impressed. They gave me complimentary egg rolls which were a bit cold but they were good. Ordered the pad Thai with shrimp and the chicken panang both mild spicy level. Let me tell you they were perfectly spiced! Food arrived hot and delicious. They even brought me ice for my can soda! They have a new customer for sure !"}
{"text":"I'm not a Thai food expert, but I really really enjoy their food.  The 3 spice duck is great, Pad Thai is fantastic, as well as almost all the appetizers.  The servers are so nice and accommodating.  The decor could use updating.  Closed on Tuesdays, which somehow is always the day I'm craving it."}
{"text":"Thai cuisine is within easy access to me, so I order from there a lot, at least once or twice a month. I've always had admiration for them because they've been in the neighborhood for a long time, outliving lots of other businesses in the area.

When ordering for takeout, my meal is always ready when I arrive to pick it up and staff is always very friendly. The food is awesome and so flavorful and part of the reason why I stay a loyal customer.

However, the one time I decided to dine in, I sat waiting for nearly 40 minutes before ultimately walking out. They put priority on their takeout orders and it kind of shows. Plus, last time I ordered from there, they got my order wrong. I always order yellow curry, but they have me red instead.

I definitely recommend this place strictly for the food or unless you have incredible patience. There's a reason why they've stuck around for so long."}
{"text":"Went here because we where looking for Peking duck, we got so much more than that and it was all worth it, it was a little expensive but worth every dollar"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it fell short. I ordered massaman curry, spice level 6. I was so disappointed in the spice level. It was a like a -6 spiciness. I tried to get past that and enjoy the dish anyway. Unfortunately, the flavor was also lacking any sort of punch. No lemon grass, star anise flavors that make this curry dish my favorite. Not a fan. The rice was overcooked in my opinion as well."}
{"text":"If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!

Now, I will be a tad sentimental here.  Thai Cuisine was my first experience with Thai.  A friend brought me there for lunch back in 2006 - and I have been a junkie ever since.  And, to be perfectly honest, I have only found one other place in the burgh that I think has comparable food in terms of taste - and the prices there are much higher.  We live about 45 minute drive from TC so for us to frequent there means that we really do enjoy the food!

Over the years, DH and I have brought many friends to TC.  To be honest, it is not much to look at.  It really is lacking in atmosphere and, to be honest, I would love to see them clean up their restrooms a lot.  But the service is always good and the food - well, the food is so good, I can live with this little \"diner\".  Besides, we always end up down the street afterwards for a coffee and there are restrooms there :)

We have tried all of the appetizers - DH says it is hands down the best hot & sour he has ever had.  Steamed dumplings are the tastiest in town - good taste but nothing overwhelming (i have had them with so much garlic, I regret eating them). Spring rolls are always tasty & fresh.  BTW - if you go at lunch, they add a tiny salad with peanut dressing to your plate - try not to lick the plate when you are done :)

I think we have tried every curry on the menu - red, green, pineapple, panang, musman, winter.  Winter is always our favorite - a green curry with the pumpkin is to die for.  DH will scrape the bowl on this one. 

I am a noodle junkie.  My favorite here of all the dishes is their Pad See Ew.  I always get it with shrimp which are nice-sized and plentiful.  It is the sauce that differentiates this from other Thai places.  TC uses a sweet black bean sauce that is amazing.  I have tried this dish and it is the sauce that makes this dish.  I have liked their Rad Na and enjoyed the fried rices but I always come back to the Pad See Ew because I know that I can't find comparable anywhere else.

I will admit that we have never tried desserts there. To be honest, we find the portions plentiful and have never wanted dessert afterwards.

If you are looking for atmosphere, head to Squirrel Hill or the South Side or Wexford. If you are looking for tasty food at a reasonable price, this is your spot.  And just remember - there is always takeout!"}
{"text":"Love the front stand lady who does take out,  always pleasant and smiling. Favorite thai food in the burgh! Yummmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try both Thai Cuisine and Thai Gourmet since they're within a few blocks of one another. My verdict is that I prefer Thai Gourmet, food-wise anyway. However, there's no doubt that the overall atmosphere is much better at Thai Cuisine. Thai Cuisine feels cleaner and better decorated. 

In terms of the food, I ordered curry and it was okay. I thought it was very mild in comparison to Thai Gourmet. My husband ordered Hawaiian fried rice and also thought it was ok. It smelled smoky but lacked the taste to match it. One thing I really did enjoy was the fried chicken dumplings, but the downfall is you only get four (and they're tiny!). 

Thai Cuisine was about average to me. I would consider coming back to try it again."}
{"text":"Disappointing.
Let me start by saying that I read several reviews before deciding to order delivery tonight and got my hopes up. The food was so bland and sweet that I couldn't even eat it. Garlic pepper chicken had no heat and tastes like cardboard. Pad Thai had sugary aftertaste that was unbearable. The free egg rolls were over-cooked and wraps were crumbling. Lastly, the dumplings had fat, bone, and grissle in them."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place and has ordered takeout from here many times. I wanted to take her somewhere I know she liked so we decided on eating in here on this visit.

Like any normal visit we were sat promptly and a waitress took our order and gave us our drinks. They started us off with veggie rolls which were alright. They weren't particularly great but it was a free start so it's hard to complain. 

And so we waited for our order. And waited. And waited. And finally over 40 (!) minutes after we had ordered a simple chicken curry I decided this was too long of a wait. After asking the front counter about the long wait and the status of our order and only getting useless shrugs in response, we walked out.

Absolutely ridiculous how long we waited and terrible service to top it off. I guess the wife can choose to still get takeout from here if she wants but any business that values their customers so little does not strike me as a place that is worth your time or money. Specially with how many great options for Thai food there are in the area."}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine is a good Thai restaurant, but the atmosphere is lacking. It feels akin to eating in a high school teachers' lounge (including the musical selections)."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!

I don't know how/why some of these people gave them a decent review?

This place is Terrible, I literally had to throw the food away.

I'm not exaggerating - the food is awful and overpriced!

I've eaten at 100s do Asian food spots around the worlds and this was a straight rip-off!

STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy crap!  I just ordered delivery while in town on business-- The Thai Cuisine roll and the Thai Basil Chicken.  They were both fantastic!  And I mean it!  I have eaten a lot of Thai, and this stuff rocked.  Perfect spiciness and delicious ingredients.  If I lived here, I would be going once-a-week.  Great job, TC!  WooHoo!"}
{"text":"(BYOB)
Went here for Saturday lunch with my husband, and we had some GREAT Thai Food! Although they open at noon, we were there a few minutes early and they seated us.  I'm a vegetarian so I really loved the fact that they had a separate menu with only vegetarian options. Made it easier than scanning through the entire menu. Prices are good! We shared spring rolls, pad Thai, green curry with 2/green teas for $31.
The interior was okay. Not very fancy, but fine. We will definitely be going there! The portions are big too, so we had some food to take home, which is always nice!"}
{"text":"I come here often and I love it. For some reason today they were cheap on the rice, but the yellow curry never fails it's perfect. At some Thai tea to top it off and you have a perfect mix. I recommend this place to anyone you wants great Thai food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The Tom Kha is delicious. All of the curry's hit the spot as well, my favorite is the red bean. Thai Cuisine has many traditional dishes as well, don't be afraid to try something you've never had before. As far as my decade of experience goes here, all of the food is good."}
{"text":"I want to give this place three and a half stars.  Half an extra star because of how well they handled a complete dirt bag when I was in there.  He refused to pay any more of his bill than ten dollars, and he was very adamant about it as he left.  There was no reason for that.  They were very dignified in how they dealt with him.  
As for the place itself, I give it one star for service.  They were very prompt and attentive.  I give it one star for price and quantity, as the lunch was an entrée, soup and egg roll appetizer, all for $6.95.  I also give it one star for the taste.  The soup was very light and the kefir lime leaves made it very bright and refreshing.  The eggroll was not very palatable, but if I ate sauces I may have enjoyed it more.  My friend had the orange chicken, which he loved.  The breading was not too thick, nor was the sauce.  I'd say that and the soup were the best things we had there.  It also wasn't too sweet.  My pahd thai was good, but a little heavy on the sauce.  I wasn't able to finish it all, but it also came with a very light fried rice that was good. 
If you are looking for an inexpensive place to do a quick thai lunch in this area, I would say this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"Food has good flavor. But service is very slow. Decor ia rather dated. Close to Nellis Air force base. Price reasonable."}
{"text":"this place is surprisingly good. lots of vegetarian options. great prices. good service. worth a  trip to the Hood."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Thai I've ever had.

The Tom Yum Veggie Soup is AWESOME. And I got the spicy basil and it was SO GOOD.

I obviously don't need to get into it too much since this place is clearly very popular and we all agree it's delicious, but someone freaked out at me about how I needed to try the soup, so I'll freak out at you: TRY THE SOUP."}
{"text":"Spicy chili mint combination fried rice ... Wow!
Pa Nang chicken .... Double wow!
I've eaten here a couple times. Very friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"Me and a friend came across this place on yelp and decided to check it out. Upon entering your greeted by such friendly people. The service was prompt and very attentive. We ordered Penang curry and orange chicken. It was delicious! We were very surprised being that it is on a not so fancied side of town. This place is a must try if you are in the area! We are definitely fans and will become regulars. Later in the week I ordered delivery and on the phone the lady was so sweet! The people that run this restaurant are just the most warm people ever. Oh! And the the free egg rolls are a plus too!"}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine is one of the best Thai places I've been to in the States - finding it in Pittsburgh was a real surprise.  The food here is outstanding, and the service is comparable to what I'd expect in a $50/person restaurant, and this place is definitely not $30/plate.  With appetizers, Thai iced tea, and two entrees, my girlfriend and I paid about $30.

I highly recommend the cold chicken and sprout salad.  Wish I could remember the name of it, because it's heavenly.  (...Which probably assumes that heaven looks like Thailand.  ...Which would be a nice place to spend eternity.)  Thai iced tea is really good, too."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh. My family and I have been going here for years. The owners and other staff are such friendly people.

They have an extensive vegan / vegetarian menu and are willing to accommodate any dietary need. Be sure to let your server know if you are vegan or have issue with dairy as the curry contains milk but can be omitted. 

The only negative thing about this place is that they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Favorite thai food place on the east side. Food is always delicious. Delivery is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for these wide noodles since I left Denver 12 yrs ago. Spices well balanced, textures are fantastic. They ask what spice level 1-10, we had 7, could go for an 8. A little pricey for lunch, but you get what you pay for. Clean dining area, clean rest rooms. You know the cute Asian girl on Modern Family? The little girl in the back is cuter. Go here! Delivery through Wheel Deliver."}
{"text":"I go here once a week it's amazing I love it and the staff is super nice always friendly and just a great place to grab a bite also it's BYOB and they give you great takeout sizes. I wish I could give more stars!!"}
{"text":"We've lived at the base of Sunrise Mtn for nearly 3 years, but when we wanted Thai we would scurry back to Henderson.  One day while we were out and about, we were hungry and decided to give Thai Cuisine a shot and WOW!  Their Thai food is great!!  So much for my illogical snotty attitude...but I digress.  We shared chicken satay and red curry, and both were fab to the extreme.  We sent some friends to try Thai Cuisine and they agreed that Thai Cuisine can stand up to the other good Thai restaurants in town.  Ambience is okay, a bit brightly lit at night, and they don't serve beer (rats), but all in all this is solid Thai food."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food especially for the price, remember when you see those 3-4 star reviews to check that person's history. Food snobs are hilarious with the stuff they nitpick about. For $8 the chicken pad thai is awesome, that's the same price as McDonalds for REAL fresh cooked food. The staff is also awesome I've been there several times and they seem like a very nice family. I cook Thai food at home and eat it a lot and this place is a great go to for a quick lunch or an easy dinner."}
{"text":"We ordered here for two day straight. We had the pad Thai which was not good. Lack of flavor and it seemed dry. The yellow curry medium was amazing on the other hand. The second day, we ordered pad see eaw (spelling) and it had a lot of meat. The beef was tender and had a lot of flavor. The vegetables in the noodles was cooked perfectly as well. Then, we also got yellow curry again medium. This time around it was way too spicy for our taste and killed the curry. Food came in 20-30 mins and it was boiling hot still which was awesome."}
{"text":"I will start my review by saying that I am not a Thai food expert, but I love Thai Cuisine!  My friends have a hard time talking me into trying any other Thai restaurant as I keep coming back here.  I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"10/10! Every time my fiancé and I come here we have such a lovely time at a reasonable price. Extremely friendly staff and perfectly delicious food every time."}
{"text":"This place has a nice neighborhood feel that I enjoy on a Friday night.  I got the steamed chicken dumplings, Tom yum soup, and chicken spicy noodles. The steamed chicken was Ok, nothing great.  The soup was spectacular despite it being extra spicy.  I got a 9 spiciness for the soup and entrée.  For the entrée it was perfect, but for the soup an 8 would have been better.  The spicy chicken noodles was very solid.  The portion was huge."}
{"text":"They always remember me and my boyfriend and the the owner always makes it to our table to welcome us back and have a sort conversation.  Food is always consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"Enjoy the pumpkin curry that is not in the menu. You have to ask for it. The shrimp toast appetizer is very good.

Never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food place. I highly recommend ordering the daily specials--especially anything with duck."}
{"text":"I just had the best red Thai curry I've ever had in my life here! Very good highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Always delicious, i think the best dish I've had here is the Thai Eggplant dish with whatever kind of meat or tofu you want.  Their Tom Yum is also amazing.  Have been here several times and I love it"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai Cuisine. I initially found this spot while searching Yelp for new vegan spots close to Shadyside.

I called to be absolutely sure they can veganize menu items and to my excitement, they could! They were incredibly nice and understood my concerns, a lot of Thai restaurants have fish sauce hidden in every dish, but this place does not! 

It's easy to order there and online (via grub hub), all you have to do is make a note that the dish needs to be vegan and it even prints off on the receipt, so when they drop off your order you get some additional piece of mind.

The cashew entree with tofu/veggies and the green salad are a must. The tofu is fried but not crispy amid all the veggies & comes with rice to soak up the mild chili sauce. The salad is fairly simple with greens, cucumber, onion etc. but the dressing or sauce as I would say, is stellar. It's a peanut/coconut milk sauce and I can honestly say I would gladly eat this every day for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Hit or miss, for me. 

The service here is excellent. I've only gotten take-out, but the lady who always seems to be handling orders is super nice. That's a huge plus. 

I've tried a few things here and I like them - their pad thai is good, as are their basil noodles. I really love their tom yum soup. The thing that makes me sad is the curry. 

I have tried the panang, green and red curries here and ...they kind of taste the same, which is disappointing. I blame this on the coconut milk, because the three times I have ordered  curries from there, they were all extremely watery/milky and the coconut milk overpowered the rest of the flavor. Unfortunately, the milk seemed to dilute the spice as well (that or my level 5 green curry was spiced identically to my boyfriend's level 9 panang curry). They were still tasty, for sure, but coconut milk soup isn't what I normally expect for my curry. 

I'd suggest their noodle dishes without reservation, but for curry, I'd point someone down a few blocks to Thai Gourmet."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place, situated as it is amongst the Italian eateries in Bloomfield, Pittsburgh's Little Italy. This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the city, and arguably the best. I've not had a bad meal here, and everything I've tried has been delicious, with the green curry standing out in my mind as one of the best I've had anywhere. We came here with a large group of people one night, some of whom had never had Thai food, and all left happy and appreciative of my excellent taste when it comes to choosing restaurants. (pat, pat, pat). One of my friends had the springroll and liked it so much he ordered another for dinner. Service here is always good, with a friendly and professional staff that takes the time to help you with ordering. The one downside is that parking is a challenge, as this is a busy street in a bustling neighborhood. I usually find parking on a sidestreet, and would brave much more difficult hurdles to get to this food."}
{"text":"This is my second time getting food from this place. The first time we ordered pad Thai and it was nothing amazing.

Tonight I ordered green curry which is my favorite, as well as chicken satay with extra peanut sauce.

Both the peanut sauce and curry were super watery. This is so disappointing. I wanted to love this place as it's so close to our house, but damn. Are they just trying to save a buck? Is this normal for them? I didn't order curry essence, I ordered curry! Boo.

Time to try another place, I guess"}
{"text":"Still sticking with my original rating.  Just had dinner here last night.  The decor is great with the new remodel and all, and the food is still solid.  I give it 3 stars because I find it to be good/serviceable Thai food, but certainly not the best in the city.  I had the eggplant dish, which was hot, fresh and tasty, but what disappointed me was the lack of requested spice (level 9).  When I ask for something to be spicy, make it spicy.  Simple request, no?  Nevertheless, I still recommend this restaurant because the quality is good, the service is good and price is right.  A great spot in the Bloomfield neighborhood for sure."}
{"text":"Consistently good, reasonably priced Thai."}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying I got on the wrong bus and ended up walking from Garfield to Bloomfield and then once in Bloomfield I proceeded to get lost behind West Penn Hospital. With that being said I was hoping that all my stumbling around in the elements would not be in vain.   

The food at Thai Cuisine is more pitiful than my sense of direction. I ordered Threes Company: shrimp, scallops and calamari in a Thai chili sauce. The sauce is my favorite part of a Thai meal but Thai Cuisine came up short here. What I enjoy must about a Thai chili sauce is the complexity of flavors but this sauce in my dish was your standard thin runny brown sauce.  The kind that comes with lets say beef and broccoli.  I think the menu description was misleading and had I known it would be brown sauce I would have ordered something else.  

Some of the onions in my dish were cold which leads me to believe that the food was not cooked to order or at least not all of it.  There was plenty of shrimp in the dish and the calamari tasted great, but the dish lacked flavor. The carrots and broccoli was cooked beyond recognition.

For my hubby I ordered the Thai steak , it tasted like a frozen salisbury steak dinner and salisbury steak just so happens to be one my least favorite foods.  Had I not sampled his dinner this would have been a solid three star review. 

I see no reason to go back here."}
{"text":"!!!!!FREE SPRING ROLLS!!!!

This is literally my first review ever. I always read reviews but I'm too lazy to write em but whatever I will get strait to the point because this place deserves this review.

1. Lady on phone was nice as fk 
2. Delivery Man was nice as fk and actually talked to me for a minute. I'm an introvert(kind person but almost anti social), that being said it still didn't annoy me. 
3. Price was good, food wasn't nasty looking smelly and didn't taste rubbery 
4. I ordered fried rice and garlic chicken.. Both were good and I got a free side of white rice and 4 free spring rolls. Yea.. 4 free spring rolls lady and gentlemen oh yea and they charge .50 for can of sodas 
5.  And they weren't stingy with the sauce 

For what this place is.. It's the best local bang for your buck! 

China Kitchen is good too but this place is an overal winner but China kitchen offers fried chicken wings 

Hong Kong kitchen(or something like that) I never tried because their reviews were terrible."}
{"text":"I was SO in the mood for Mexican I could taste the salt water of the Gulf all the way from Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, my favorite Mexican joint was closed, Lot 17 smelled like the day after a frat party, so Thai Cuisine it was.  So - you know when you're really looking forward to one thing, so the next thing will just stink in comparison? That's how a felt. Even as a Thai-lover, I just couldn't imagine anything other than chimichangas, and I don't even LIKE chimichangas.  Well, Thai Cuisine turned my Mexican frown completely upside down.

I started with the fresh Thai rolls; a deliciously fresh spring roll that almost gave Trams' spring rolls a run for their money...almost.  For my main course I chose the day's special - Winter Curry with Shrimp.  A delightfully sweet mix of large shrimp, perfectly cooked potatoes and vegetables PLUS an amazing thai-type of squash similar to pumpkin swimming in luxurious creamy curry, this meal demands a return trip. Terrific, simply terrific (BYOB, btw).  Our server was incredible to boot, so yay for Thai Cuisine.  Kind of a boring title though - might I suggest \"Thai My Hands & Call Me Satisfied!\"  Wait - no, that came out wrong..."}
{"text":"I always order delivery from this place i have yet to go to the actual location but i love to order from here i generally purchase there egg rolls every time i order their delivery. The orange chicken isnt to bad. They usually come way before it says its supposed to get here which is great i will make it a habit to order from here often"}
{"text":"Before commenting on the food for this place I have to state that I am not the biggest fun of Asian cuisine.  I was found over there accidentally, since my friends wanted to go there.  Despite this fact I found it interesting place.  The food was well cooked and tasty.  Service was fast and in general a nice, warm atmosphere.  For the record, my company that is into Asian food, love this place (so I assume it is a nice place for whoever likes eastern cuisine)."}
{"text":"Walked in with a hankering for Thai tea boba & maybe food. But I definitely changed my mind on the food when I walked in. It was dingy looking & the pics of the food didn't look very appetizing. 

Anyway I order the Thai tea w/boba & the boba looked very old & disgusting. I tried it anyway. The boba's texture was the WORST I have ever tasted or felt. It was falling apart & really slimy. I took it back & the staff acknowledged that I was given old boba! WTF?! They offered me new boba & apologized. Why would you knowingly serve something that should have been thrown away weeks ago?! Anyway, they were nice about it but BEWARE of their entire menu. I wouldn't be surprised to see them on an episode of dirty dining."}
{"text":"A surpringly good, authentic Thai restaurant, despite the advertisement of Chinese, Thai Cuisine was a delight.  I had the yellow curry, pad see ewe, egg rolls, and Thai iced tea.  The Thai iced tea was sweet, but not too sweet.  The pad see ewe we had was with chicken, and the meat was plentiful.  The flavor was very good, and the Chinese broccoli was fresh and tasty.  Even the noodles were tasty, and no grease!  

The yellow chicken curry surprised me the most.  It was styled just the way I like it, similar to the (old) Thai Grill: soupy, but flavorful.  I was quite delighted to find another Thai restaurant that makes curry this way instead of the usual Indian style.  The curry wasn't as flavorful as the (old) Thai Grill, but it was definitely good!

I recommend this Thai restaurant for the Thai dishes.  I haven't tried the Chinese dishes, and I don't plan to, but chances are that they are tasty as well.  I will be coming here often since it is close to my work!"}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine is the slightly pricier of the two Thai places near my house, so for super casual takeout purposes I usually just go to Thai Gourmet. Their Pad Thai is delicious and enough for four meals. I also adore the girls who work the front of the house there. Thai Cuisine's food tends to be a bit more flavorful however, and sometimes that's just what I want without having to drive somewhere. 

My boyfriend and I ordered from here the other night, and I must say I think we'll be back for a sit-down meal fairly soon! I tried their version of Pad Thai since I hadn't had that in a while, and he had spicy basil friend rice. The Pad Thai had a tamarind sauce, which I've been led to believe is more authentic. Authentic or not it had that red spicy edge that I prefer in Pad Thai, and I couldn't get enough of it! Most Pad Thai around here is a sweet brown sauce, which is fine but not as complex. The Thai place near my mother's house makes their Pad Thai the way I like it, and I've been on an unofficial hunt to track down a similar version of the dish nearer to where I live. The hunt is now over! The portions here are a bit smaller for the higher price point, but the taste and quality balances it out very well. The service has also been great whenever I've come in, something else that I really appreciate. I'll for sure be back for more takeout and with visiting friends for a proper dinner very soon."}
{"text":"This is our favorite go-to place. I have not been disappointed by anything I have tried here. Love all of the curries. The pad Thai is the best I have tried anywhere, even outside of Pittsburgh. The Hawaiian fried rice is amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came to this restaurant due to having the craves for pad Thai for the night. We got there before 9pm Saturday night.  We were welcomed with 4 egg rolls and sauce along with our menus. The waiter was super quick.  We ordered the shrimp fried rice, pad Thai noodles chicken, and green chicken curry.  The waiter asked us what spicy level we wanted from 1-10, 10 being ultra spicy and 1 being mild. Wife chose 2 for the spice level which was the right choice because overtime the dish became spicy.  The meal came to us around 10-15 minutes.  The fried rice was awesome and delicious.  I haven't that good of fried rice in awhile.  Of course the pad Thai noodle was delicious as well and I would come back to this restaurant again!  They also deliver too so call them up if you can't make it to their place.  Lastly, we were also given banana rolls as a special for the week."}
{"text":"This was gross and a waste of 28 dollars. My curry was a few strips of chicken and chunks of potatoes in a giant tub of milk. Thai gourmet a few blocks down is awesome...too bad they were closed."}
{"text":"Once again, I found myself craving curry...

This is the story of my life. I fiend for good curry. This place has GOOD curry.
I got the green curry with duck (love it!). It was creamy, spicy, a tad sweet and nutty.

The only reasons this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is A) The spiciness was not on par with the 7 I had requested and B) The waitress didn't seem too happy to be there. But maybe she was just having an off day.

P.S. If you're a crab rangoon junkie, you MUST try them here!"}
{"text":"Very solid Thai place. I have the fried spring rolls, which was good (crispy flaky crust, but the filling wasn't anything to write about), the vegetarian tom yum soup (pretty good, but honestly I've had better tasting broth), and the winter curry.  The curry was interesting, but the kabocha squash (which i'm a fan of) didn't seem to fit in right with the curry.  The curry itself was good and the dish was a good effort.  My gf had the vegetarian pad thai.  She thought it was good, but a little too soupy (too much fluid).

Also, they offer most things spiciness from a scale of 1 to 10.  They said 5 is good, but I tasted almost no spice.  I'd go for a 10 next time.

From what I read this places is among the best in Pitt, and I can see how this might be true.  Next time I'm in Pitt, I'll definitely consider coming back."}
{"text":"Me and my friend had a \"Bangkok Seafood\" and a \"Thai Treasure Hot Pot\". Both of them were very delicious, except the yellow curry in the seafood didn't seem quite well dissolved. To be fair, it happens a lot for Thai/Indian food, which therefore didn't bother us enjoy our great dinner."}
{"text":"I came here a year or two ago and can't forget about it ever since. Finally I made my way back here and grabbed take out. It was just delicious as I remembered! The place isn't classic and quite cozy. Drunken noodle is my all time favorite!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Thai food I've ever had!

I think their specialty are their curries.  You can't go wrong with any of their curries.  

I think their other dishes are good, but not all of them are in the same level as their curries.  Their pad thai was good and their spicy calamari was a bit underwhelming.

For appetizers, I've tried their taro roll (good!) and their thai spring rolls (good as well!).  For soups, I've tried their Tom Yum soup and it was excellent - just not served in a easy-to-ladle-and-serve container.

BUT, with that being said, head straight there and order their curry!  It's excellent!"}
{"text":"Came back to my favorite restaurant for dinner after not being here for MONTHS (is that a sin?) and I was SO excited.

We had to start off with the crab rangoons- of course. Thai Cuisine has them down to a T. They were perfect and the sauce was awesome.

I wanted to try something different, so per our wonderful server's suggestion- my friend and I split the eggplant entrée with beef and the spicy basil noodles with chicken. We ordered both at a whopping 11 (1-10 heat scale). After talking with our server about Thai heat levels, he informed us that if we enjoy spicy food we should order above the \"American 10\". He told us that \"Thai hot\" is a 15. We took a chance with ordering it at 11 (I normally stick with the 5-6 range) and it was a good decision! The food was AWESOME and wasn't too spicy at all. The eggplant dish was amazing- the chili garlic sauce was OUT of this world and of course, they are always generous with the sauce- which I adore. The spicy basil noodles were amazing.. I have been dreaming about those noodles ever since.

When it comes to Thai food, Thai Cuisine is where it's at. The food is AWESOME, the service is always consistent and wonderful and they are also BYOB. You can't beat it."}
{"text":"Had the fried tofu appetizer, pad Thai with tofu, and Thai iced tea. Giving this place a 2 star bc the tofu tasted like it had gone bad, I addressed it to the waitress and she just told the kitchen without apologizing for the bad taste of the tofu. The noodles were not bad, but the quality of service based off of experience deserves a low grade for this place. Was unsatisfied with the experience, and I always will comment and connect my rating experience with customer service. 

I did not ask for a discount for the bad food nor did I throw a fit to the waitress, I think anyone would have wanted to be acknowledged for having to eat bad tofu..."}
{"text":"This place has really delicious authentic Thai food.  My favorite from them is the Curry Fried Rice.  I haven't found any other restaurant that has made it that way.  What's also good is the Seafood sour soup.  It comes with a plentiful of shrimp, scallops, squid, and octopus.  Delicious in flavor and broth.

I don't quite like the Pad Thai though, to me it has kind of a sweet taste with just isn't accord with me.  I prefer the Pad Thai from Pin Kaow, which is separate when you get the Pad Thai you put the bean sprouts, peanuts, and dressing in it.  That's what I'm more used to when I had it in Viet Nam."}
{"text":"Honestly was super cheap! LOVE chicken mint chili & crab things. Not a big fan of there orange chicken but it's a great price for deliver! $16 feed me and my boyfriend who eats a ton! 16 dollars got me a bunch of white rice, lunch special( feeds two)  of spicy chili mint chicken which more fried rice! Carb Rangoon & two cans of soda FOR $16.75 like with free delivery. Love this place. But I hate the Mexican lady who took my order. She didn't know I spoke Spanish and she was telling the other guy how she can't understand me and was being rude to me because she didn't know English. NOT MY FAULT."}
{"text":"Great currys. Affordable. And not super fancy. This place is within walking distance to my house which clearly means it's perfect for a quick dinner, or to walk over and get carry out. I enjoy eating thai food at least once a week so this place has become a pleasant staple in my diet.

mussaman and panang curry are my go to eats here. and I strongly believe that I could live on it (and i'm trying to)

oh and crab rangoon is totally not thai, but delightful nonetheless."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh (actually, one of my favorite restaurants overall). I typically order take-out/Grub Hub, and the food is always prepared quickly, packed well, and tastes delicious. As far as appetizers, I've had the steamed Pork Buns (a \"special\" that is pretty much always on the menu, as far as I know), which are phenomenal. Everyone raves about Noodlehead's Pork Buns, but I think these may be better. The chicken satay and spring rolls are great as well.

My S.O. typically gets the house noodles or one of the curries (favorites including panang, green, and yellow). My favorite dish on the menu is the hawaiian fried rice. There is such a variety of flavors and textures in the meal that combine to make a great entree overall.

Finally, the servers are all fantastic and the owner (I think she is the owner - she is almost always at the front of the house) is so sweet and sincere. Seeing her is always a pleasure!"}
{"text":"I surmised two things from my visit to Thai Cuisine:

a) the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this town

b) yinzers wouldn't know good thai food if it flew into their open mouths

This place was horrible. My fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what you'd find at a church fish-fry. Insipid, over-battered and generally unpleasant. My dining partner's masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream. Surprisingly, the joint was slammed. 

On the bright side, service was very fast. On the downside, our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the 14-top of inebriated co-eds across the room from us.

The takeaway: If you're from Pittsburgh, you'll probably love this place -- it was packed with your kinsmen when I was there. But if you've enjoyed quality thai food in any large coastal metropolis, steer clear.

p.s. food was needlessly pricey given the poor quality."}
{"text":"Always ordering delivery from this place. Great food at a great cost. The combination fried rice, spicy chicken soup, and  wontons are delicious. Would recommend this place. Service is great!"}
{"text":"They get two stars for reheated leftovers, and egg rolls that had a decent flavor.

I guess I'm spoiled, because I'm used to authentic Thai Food, fresh out of the kitchen. I tried their, chicken pad thai, (my go to) and it was brutally obvious that the chicken had been reheated. I'm sorry, but if they are going to serve previously cooked food, they need to come down on the price. I don't like leftovers at home, let alone leftovers I have to pay for."}
{"text":"I know I've always like this place but I seem to forget how good it actually is until I have it again. This is really solid Thai. The curries are delicious and loaded with fresh ingredients (I've had the red, green, and mussaman) but, after trying the spicy basil noodles tonight at the suggestion of other yelpers, I don't think I'll be able to order anything else ever again. Seriously seriously good (I had it with duck) and you can definitely split it. Also, this place is cheap...you really can't do better than their lunch deal. I wish I had a place like Thai Cuisine nearby in DC.

Only thing I've had here that I didn't like: the fresh rolls are kind of mediocre but I'm not much of a fan of fresh rolls to begin with so take that as you will."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai food in Pittsburgh! My husband introduced me to Thai food a few years ago and ever since then I've been addicted to pad thai. :) Specifically, Thai Cuisine's version. We don't live near the restaurant, but somehow that doesn't stop us from getting take out once a week.  The staff is very knowledgable and super friendly. It is also byob, which is always a nice bonus."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Kuay Jub, a special noodle soup dish not found at too many Thai restaurants. It had authentic ingredients that the dish should have. The taste was spot on and the portion was large. I've also had the pad see ew on many occasions and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Living on the East side of Las Vegas, we are limited on good places to eat. Thai Cuisine is a place I've been going to for years. Thai food is probably one of my favorite type of foods to eat, so I've tried many places in the valley. This place rates right in the middle. 

The food is good enough to crave but not great enough to be my number one choice. Of course if I don't want to drive far and I have a craving, I don't really have much of a choice. 

The Thai Beef salad here is delicious. Just the perfect amount of lettuce and spices. I always cry about how Thai places do not like to put a lot of veggies in their Thai Beef Salad. They think a lot of beef is what people want. But not everyone. I love my veggies! 

Last visit we had ordered Spicy Seafood Soup. One of my favorites dishes to order. It comes out in a bowl on fire. Soup is sour with a great kick to it. Large variety of seafood inside, We also ordered Chicken Pad Thai, first time ordering it here. It was ok. Noodles were cooked well but there was a lack of flavor. It was more on the sweeter side.

Service is great. they bring out complimentary egg rolls which is appreciated. They don't accept debit/credit cards for some reason. But, they do have a ATM inside the restaurant. So be prepared to have cash if you decide to dine here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Our waitress was excellent.  The food is really good.  

The glass noodle salad has so many fresh flavors going on, it felt like summer - quite welcome in the middle of a cold winter spell.  Their dumplings are nice and big while the dough is still light and thin.  They have a separate vegetarian menu.  Though I am not a vegetarian, I'm sure it is a nice touch for those who are.  Their daily specials are a nice change from the standard Thai fare at so many restaurants.  They are great about tailoring spice levels.  

I have a family member who is Thai and prefers the Thai restaurant down the street, however, I'm sticking with Thai Cuisine as my favorite."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Thai food and is priced great for the amount of food!  The lady that owns the place is super nice."}
{"text":"The food is really good, I take it to go most if the time, and a really good Thai tea as well. The place could be slightly cleaner but the kitchen looks good"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here a few times and I am NEVER disappointed.  The Mongolian Beef is DELICIOUS, the Cashew Chicken is perfect, and the Combination Fried Rice is spot on!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Never been to this spot and pass it frequently.  After seeing 4 stars I decided to give it a go.  Ordered Mongolian Beef, fried rice with a side of noodles and a fountain drink ($11.25).  Staff was nice and friendly, portions were good and it was very nice of them to include 4 egg rolls free of charge!  Unfortunately, the food was very basic and lacked any flavor.  The beef had good veggies mixed in but again not much flavor, rice didn't seem to be fried rice but steam rice with some egg and peas in it.  Noodles were ok.  I was thankful for the free egg rolls that came with sweet n sour which I used to flavor up my beef.  I've had better at Panda Express.  Doubt I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Panang curry is where it's at. This place is such a non-descript, hole in the wall, blink and you'll miss it restaurant. The area is sketchy-Bonanza and Nellis-and the inside is pretty sparse although they do have a cool raised seating area that's pretty unique. Don't let the location and the looks of it scare you away. 
Like I said at first, the panang curry is on point here. Perfectly seasoned, spiciness according to your specifications (I'm a complete wimp and opt for a 1). It's maybe the best panang curry I've had in Vegas.  You're given complimentary egg rolls here and they're not too bad. 
The service was great despite the fact that it was crowded and there was only one server. She was friendly and attentive to our needs. Short but sweet-this place is good."}
{"text":"Have been going here for probably 10 years, and have never been disappointed.  Top notch food, great service, and the specials are always worth trying out.  My favorite Thai in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I visited Thai Cuisine for lunch. I adore Thai food and wanted to continue my search to find an establishment to rival my favorite, Komol. I opted for vegetarian Pad Thai. It tasted like the Thai noodles I made from a box. The sauce was overly sweet. I much more prefer savory and spicy with a hint of sweetness. Aside from the tofu and a couple of green onions, this vegetarian dish was sorely in need of vegetables. The complimentary egg rolls were light, crisp and veggie-friendly. I remain puzzled why a noodle dish would be served with a side of rice. The Thai iced tea was creamy and sweet, just the way I like it. I had two."}
{"text":"If you get nothing else here, get the tom kha soup. It is seriously the best I've ever had anywhere. I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. But this tom kha soup is the standard for which I compare all other tom kha soups. I've yet to find its match. It is truly delicious. I usually get the veggie variation (loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies!) but any variation is just as wonderful. 

I just returned home from a trip to Thai Cuisine with some friends. The environment is comforting and warm. I love the lights strewn along the windows! They just add to the coziness of the place. After getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup, I got the green curry with shrimp. Others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased with their choices. The green curry was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies were nice and crisp.

They were featuring their mango and sticky rice dessert. I had a bite of my friend's and I was sad that I was too full to have a dessert of my own! 

As we rolled out of our booth, totally stuffed and satisfied, we all proclaimed that this was the best decision we could have made with our night. Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Thai Cuisine?  Relaxed and spacious atmosphere.  Friendly hosts who will humor you if you try to speak Thai to them, and of course great Thai food. 

They were even kind enough to offer me a generous handful of Kaffir lime leaves when I wanted to try my own hand at some Thai cookin!"}
{"text":"It was a rainy Friday night in April... After what felt like the longest and roughest week ever... We decided to stay in, order off the app, and watch tv. After scrolling through dozens of different restaurants... We came across this places... And decided to give it a try. 

I can't really rate the service, but when I did call to confirm the order... The lady on the phone was nice and specific with the instructions we input on the modifications. Huge plus, because they paid attention. The food came in about 30 min which was awesome! The driver was super nice... And the food came packed tightly and was presentable. Remember to Take care of the driver! 

We ordered the Panang curry... Veggies only... Prepared vegan (no fish sauce). It came just as we ordered... (Spicy and full of veggies). We ordered the yellow curry fried rice no egg no butter... Again... Came just as we ordered. The order also came with complimentary egg rolls... So don't order them unless you want extra. We did on accident ( for my friend, they aren't vegan) and wound up with a ton of left overs... Which wasn't necessarily a bad thing at all! 

I would definitely recommend this place for take out or delivery. I haven't been inside so I can't really speak for dining in. We will definitely be ordering from them!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for straight-forward good Thai food then Thai Cuisine is the place to go. No frills, BYOB, no spa-like music simple Thai. It was quite good-I can't say it was an over the moon astounding, mind blowing, life changing experience, but it was good and what you want when you go for Thai food. 

My husband had the spicy duck and it had good flavor, although more of a 5 than 7 on a 1-10 spicy scale. Really good. 

I had spicy noodles chillin' at my standard 7 on the 1-10 scale. I can't complain. The noodles were great and the vegetables were deliciously cooked (I tend to go vegetarian). 

I will say the dumplings and spring rolls we had as appetizers were a notch above what we've had elsewhere in Pitt. 

We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Pittsburgh, I was always trying to find the best Thai restaurant. I failed miserably. So when I visited for July 4th, I had a friend take me to her favorite place. This was it! and I was grateful!

I went with about 8 people and we BYOB'ed which was a fantastic idea. Some semi-sweet white wine went well with the flavorful light Thai food. Most of the table had the curries(I thought the red was the best), but I went with the eggplant with the vegetarian duck. Simply delicious! Highly highly recommend it. The spicy basil sauce was the highlight. My partner had one of the chef specials, which was by far the most interesting, but maybe not the tastiest. 

Overall, an affordable, low-fuss, great place to eat. There also seemed to be a steady crowd there when we got there and left. It looks like a popular spot. For good reason!"}
{"text":"Secret off menu item that I just discovered!!! ORDER THE CHAING MAI NOODLES!!! I feel like I need to shout this from the rooftops! If it's not a special, you can still order it. 

Pittsburgh has more than a few asian noodle fusion and Thai noodle spots but NOTHING compares to the Chaing Mai at Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield. 

Everything at Thai cuisine is awesome but these noodles just blew me away. Juicy chicken, perfectly crisp blanched veggies and noodles all topped in a fabulous coconut curry sauce. Finished with a few crispy fried thin noodle crispies that add a little crunch!"}
{"text":"Sooo far best thai place northeast las vegas good service lovely ladys and a good atmosphere will be coming back forsure &(best of all quality food &great prices)"}
{"text":"My go to Thai place on the east side. Family owned, awesome Tom Yum and Tom Ka! Great people and good value"}
{"text":"I love it here the food is great the ppl are nice there the kind of ppl that remember your name the soup is good that one of the main reason I come back all the time!"}
{"text":"One of our go-to places for Thai. Food is wonderful, place is spotless for eating in, the staff is very friendly, and they accurately estimate your pick up time for takeout. Nothing to add, if you like Thai you will love this place!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have passed through this place multiple times and I never had a clue it existed. Hands down one of the best Tom yum soup I've ever had. Also their Panag curry is so delicious, I order their Pad Thai and honestly I was really disappointed :( but overall I loved it. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine is just ok, there's nothing that makes them stand out from other thai restaurants. Around the city of Pittsburgh there's a lot of Thai restaurants so you really have to make yourself stand out over the other restaurants and Thai Cuisine just doesn't have that quality.
I started with spring rolls and veggie Tom Kha soup. The soup was very good. The spring rolls were good and the dipping sauce was ok, nothing special. 
For my entree I ordered the veggie bird nest noodles (crispy noodles). I didn't think it was that good. There was WAY too much sauce, it was almost a soup and the sauce didn't have much flavor at all. Also the veggies were sliced too big, they should have been cut into smaller pieces, it would have made the dish more manageable to eat.
I'll eat at Thai Cuisine again if it's suggested by someone else but it won't be my first choice for a thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food every time.
We get a lot of take-out from here and occasionally dine-in. 
 All noodle dishes are great.
Tofu saute appetizer is a favorite of ours.
Soup is yummy too!"}
{"text":"After several years, this is still my favorite place for green curry chicken. Thai tea with boba is excellent here. It's nice and small which helps the atmosphere. Service has always been great and they remember you when you are a returning customer. I'm always happy to take people there with me and will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Two friends of mine raved about this place & we decided to go on my recent visit to Pittsburgh (I'm originally from here, now living in Chicago). It was everything they said it would be! The owner, Lisa, couldn't have been any nicer! So sweet!

I started off with the Fresh (not fried) Thai Cuisine roll. Not the best I've ever had, but very good (good enough that I WOULD re-order them). 

I then moved on to the Spicy Basil Chicken. I ordered brown rice and for the month of February, it comes in the shape of a heart! Whimsy! This dish was very yummy! Freshly prepared, the veggies were cooked just right (tender crunchiness), the chicken was moist and the spice level (I chose 5) was just right. I would order this dish again as well.

In summary, reasonably priced, VERY friendly service (our waiter was charming), great food and a nice atmosphere. I would definitely seek this restaurant out on my next visit."}
{"text":"Delicious - veg curries, veg fried rice, all had a good balance of flavor.  while the food was very tasty, the fried tofu was a bit too oily.  they do a good job of estimating spice levels (by asking for a 1-10 preference).  the restaurant is nicely appointed with comfortable seating.  prices are OK.  veg friendly - we ordered vegan prep and all the dishes were compliant."}
{"text":"It is okay for the food, but really not what I expected. The green curry is actually yellow curry, oh well."}
{"text":"Pineapple Fried Rice
Chicken Satay
Crab Rangoons
Thai Style Chicken Wings
Eggrolls 
Glass Noodle Salad


Then you need to invite me over. :)"}
{"text":"If you live in Pittsburgh, you may understand how contentious the issue of \"favorite local Thai restaurants\" is.

So, I'll begin this review w/ my personal bias: Thai Cuisine is our go-to Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. This is in part due to proximity, but the relationship is on no small part sustained through friendly staff and consistent dining experiences.

Thai Cuisine is -- as my wife and I like to put it -- a rainy-Sunday-evening type place. Their curry broths are great, the apps are tasty, but not too filling, and the ambiance -- particularly after their recent renovations -- is warm and inviting.

I'll admit, that if your'e in it purely from a culinary angle, there may be better options, but for the buck, you won't find many that beat Thai Cuisine."}
{"text":"My aunt picked this place after she heard we were vegetarians. Normally, when someone suggests a place with all kinds of fake meat on the menu, I will insist on finding a better option, but she assured me it was good so I just went with it.

I guess I underestimated their ability to prepare fake meat... serving a Jewish community does mean that many customers are vegetarian outside their home. Mike and I both went with fake duck dishes... mine (basil sauce) was decidedly better than his (don't remember... something bland). The appetizers were all pretty standard, but nothing stood out as particularly good or bad. 

Overall, 3-star food, plus vegetarian options, plus byob... it's a low 4."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend to enjoy some Thai food. I usually order delivery from Eat24, so this was my first time eating there in person. The food tasted very nice (as usual), the service was great (we were seated quickly and had refills offered as often as our glasses were empty), and didn't have to wait long for food at all. 

I ordered a Pad See Ew dish with tofu and personally loved it. Their spring rolls were also very yummy and their Thai Boba tea tasted amazing. Personally, I love eating Thai Cuisine and look forward to coming again.

P.S. I found their bathrooms extremely clean and well kept."}

Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum
Good Oh My God So Good Yes
Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum

Here is a story about the time I had a MAJOR FAIL:
I lived in Bloomfield just blocks from this place, and I never ate here.  The end.

Seriously, what the hell is wrong with me that today was the first time I ate here?  Also,if you eat lunch here during your work day, you should know the rest of your day will feel like a giant let down.

This place looks like a dive from the outside.  Its actually pretty cute inside.  They are really affordable.  I had the Pineapply Curry with tofu, and my friend had the Eggplant something, I cna't remember, but he liked it.

The lemongrass soup is good and spicy and the cripy spring roll is delicious and small, so you're ready for your entree.  I loved mine.  I ate the whole thing and I dont even feel guilty.  

This place is delicious, and I will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"This is only based on my first experience.. I had the pad Thai and I personally didn't like it. It was sweet and sour with a strong vinegar smell and tasted that way as well. I did like the egg rolls and service. I will probably go again to try other items but not the pad Thai again."}
{"text":"Ever been to Thai Spoon in Dormont? This is basically a photocopy of that since they are owned and operated by sisters. The menus, price and taste are almost identical. I guess it's just a matter of your personal preference where you choose to go.

The Staffs here are attentive and very friendly. The food are equally good. I've tried a variety of dish during my few visits here from drunken noodle, spicy duck, pad thai, green curry, spicy noodles etc. The price are pretty reasonable for the portion and of course the quality of the food. Plus, it's a BYOB.

Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Always good and has great delivery. It is my daughter's favorite Thai place. She comes home from Oklahoma and that's the first thing she wants to order or take out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in the city. All of their curries are wonderful and can be vegan. And I'm pretty sure this is a woman owned business."}
{"text":"I love the pad see ew!! And complimentary spring rolls. The Thai tea here is honestly the best I've tasted and I go around to different boba shops to taste them so I think my opinion is pretty valid lol. The only flaw would have to be that I wish the food would come out a little quicker"}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly retract my earlier review, B/c it was for the wrong Thai restaurant (I mistook Cuisine for Gourmet). Our group of nearly 20 people were all satisfied with tonight's takeout, including several Pad Thai, spicy fish, spicy fried rice, edaname, samosas, and drunken noodles."}
{"text":"My fiance and I met another couple for dinner on a Friday night.  This place is BYOB, so bring a bottle or two.  We got there a bit early and the waiter had no problem opening our wine and letting us take out time to explore the menu and chat.  When we finally did order, our food came out pretty quickly, which was good for me bc I was hungry!   I got the coconut veggie soup, level 7, and it was delicious!  My favorite part of the dinner.  I also got the mosman curry, level 7, which was above average, but not amazing. It was not nearly as spicy as I thought a 7 would be.  If you want a little more spice in your curry go for am 8 or 9.   Over all a good little place for Thai!"}
{"text":"Solid joint. I like the delivery service for the EASTCYDE. They always throw in a couple of egg rolls. FOR SHEEZIE!

Beef or chicken curry with rice always hits the spot. Thai jerky isn't bad. I can't complain about the chicken pad Thai. Their seafood soup is awesome with rice after a day of snowboarding or when you're sick.

Friendly staff. Sometimes a language barrier when on the phone. I think they were training someone \"fresh off the boat\" na eye mean?

One of two good Thai joints on the EASTCYDE. Thanks Thai Cuisine for the delivery service whenever I'm too lazy to leave. HIGH LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped back in here on a hot Friday night for our second visit to the place, and it was just as amazing as the first, several years ago.

I like the fact that the name of this restaurant is just what they offer: Thai Cuisine.  Nothing fancy, nothing they can charge you an arm and a leg for because it's gourmet or anything like that.  It's just good, delicious, well-prepared Thai food, served by a knowledgable and friendly waitstaff.

Last night, we were starving after walking around in the 90+ degree heat for several hours, so we ordered a few plates of appetizers to split before our entrees.  They have a page of 'daily specials' with their menu, and 'shrimp blankets' were on it, so we checked them out.  Basically, it's a shrimp (tail-on) in a spring roll, served with a dipping sauce.  So very good.

We also got an order of the spring rolls, which were ever-so-slightly tangy, and the Thai toast, which was so crispy and delicious, I considered getting a second order.  Their cucumber dipping sauce comes with little chunks of fresh cucumber in it.  

And since I recently discovered the magic of veggie tom-yum soup, I decided to try theirs.  Oh, so good!  On a hot day, I always crave something salty, and this was exactly what I wanted: the bowl is crammed with veggies and tofu (salty, spicy tofu - yum!), and the broth is just spicy enough to please your tastebuds but not overwhelm them.

The servers will ask how spicy you would like to have your meal prepared (the soup as well).  I tried everything at a 4, which I felt was just fine.  It wasn't bland, but I wasn't panting.  Our server said that around a 7 is when things start to get seriously spicy, so go ahead and order in that range if you are brave!

I had the garlic pepper pork (my favorite Thai meal) for an entree.  It was incredible, salty and garlicky and the white rice was puffy and just the tiniest bit sticky in that perfectly-prepared way.  Lots of good chunks of veggies on the plate as well, and enough sauce to spread on your rice (and enough food to have leftovers for lunch the next day!).  My husband got the pork fried rice, and it was a huge, tasty portion.  Thankfully, the servers were quick with water refills, because all that saltiness makes you thirsty!

Another perk - Thai Cuisine is BYOB!  I truly wish we'd planned on our visit last night, so we could have brought a bottle of wine with us (the closest liquor store is down on Butler Street, so a bit of a hike if you're walking), but we just happened to be in the area when my Thai food craving hit.  I am so glad Thai Cuisine was there to supply the delicious food that I needed!"}
{"text":"OMG! I don't know why i waited so long to do eat here? Was it the very unassuming space it occupies or the generic name? No, i think it was because I didn't want to be disappointed. After living in LA I had resisted trying Thai food in other cities because I didn't think it could compare but boy was I wrong! I ate here early evening on a Tuesday when I was the only diner. The hostess was quite charming and welcoming and asked me to sit wherever I wanted rather than ushering me to the table that would be most convenient to the server. But the server seemed quite happy to come to me and to recite the specials to me. I ordered two of them for my meal and they both were incredibly delicious and each had just the right texture. I started with the soft shell crab with two dipping sauces. The crab practically melted in my mouth and the shell gave it just a little crunch. Both dipping sauces were tasty but I preferred the hotter one. Then the roast duck in a curry sauce came and it was cut into small cutlets ( or i guess what today we call ' tenders') and they were tender with just enough crispiness on the outside of each piece. The sauce was a light curry one and not gloppy as they sometimes fan be. I had asked for a 6th degree of hot-ness on a scale of 1-10 but could have ordered a 7.
I can't wait to go back with friends so I can try many more of their dishes. You should gather a couple of friends and go too!"}
{"text":"I agree 100% on Maggie G's review. Over priced, bad food, and Pittsburgh DOESN'T know GOOD Thai food.. Plus $40 bucks on Take out...seriously? Ill pass I've had better Thai for less. 

Yellow Curry (Ive added a picture of exactly how watery the curry truly is ) 
(x2) Spring Rolls (2 per order)
Dumplings (5 per order)

40 BUCKS

Ill stick to Bangkok Balcony. No more trying out different Thai places in the city. I rather not waste my money on watered down curries and bland dishes which seems to be the norm for the Pittsburgh Thai scene."}
{"text":"Food was not bad (I ordered the green curry chicken), but their poor choice of plates and cups (tea cups were like diner coffee mugs) didn't feel very authentic. I would order for take out instead next time."}
{"text":"The glass noodles are awesome!! I ordered Mongolian beef, beef and broccoli, and glass noodles so that I could sample the food.  I didn't care too much for the beef, but the noodles had great flavor!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas Valley. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I love the pad thai and the Thai beef salad. My wife loves the curry.  We've never had anything that didn't taste great."}
{"text":"Jack was a wonderful server and made some amazing \"not on the menu\" recommdations for our order. He was fast, friendly & was thoughtful about his suggestions based on what we were asking for.

Our meal was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend had a spicy curry dish with faux duck and I had thin rice noodles with chicken and shrimp. I love that they will cater your dish to the amount of spice you want. Often, I want to try certain dishes but stay away from anything labeled \"spicy\" because I'm a baby!

We left completely satisfied and I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A year later, prices have increased 70% and the quality of food have declined. Customer service is still superb though. Today, I ordered a pad-see-yew with beef level 5 - was made in an old pan with burnt scraps, 25% beef in dish only, there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish, and was drenched in oil. Another dish, red curry with chicken, was always lacking chicken pieces, they've increased prices and cut back on portions and quality, which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad. Sad to say, this used to be my favorite place, but now we will never return and we are currently looking for another Thai place to be our go-to."}
{"text":"Friendly Service. Fresh Veggies! At only 1 dollar a person for BYOB and no corkage this place is a steal! The price is right too! 

If you are a veggie, curry, wine lover who loves family style friendly service, then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Stopped here based on its Yelp raiting while driving through Pittsburgh. The other Yelpers are right--this is a good place. The food was excellent, the service was prompt, and the prices were very reasonable.

My one complaint is that my wife ordered a tea that never came. Mistakes happen, so I'm not going to take a star off for this, but if you go here don't be afraid to remind the waitstaff if they forget part of your order."}
{"text":"Chicken pad se ew is amazing. I got a \"5\" in spicy and it was pretty hot! Next time I'll get lower spice. The mango with sticky rice is such a good dessert. This is one of our go to's every time we're in town!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Whoever leaves bad reviews obviously doesn't know what authentic thai food taste like . My bf, dad and myself are regulars here. We come here weekly and will continue to do so. We love the workers, service and most specially the food."}
{"text":"I was in the Bloomfield neighborhood and feeling hungry. I did not look up restaurants in advance on Yelp, but I saw this restaurant on the side of the road, and I decided to try it out, despite its generic name. The food was actually pretty tasty. I ordered crab rangoon, which I would rate 3 stars, and green curry fish, which I would rate 4 stars. The curry was at the level of spiciness that I had requested. I just wish that the serving size were a bit larger. The restaurant was clean, and the seating was comfortable. The waitress was friendly. I would return to this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I where looking for a good place to eat and he's never had any other thai foods. He can't eat meat or chicken but they had a good variety of seafood items on the menu and felt he had a good amount to choose from. Lots of shrimp and catfish. Yum! Good place for frist time thai eaters at a low price.Customer service was great, very friendly environment! Portions are pretty well sized for the price, I couldnt finish my plate though cuz it was so much. Might be a great place for a large party too since they do offer to give you extra plates for sharing. They also do carry out/delivery so they have a verity of boxes to take your food home with you no problem. I will definitely be coming back to this thai place again to try all it menu items!!"}
{"text":"I have gone here twice in 2 weeks and have loved it both times! I ordered the pad see ew, my boyfriend had the pad Thai, Dad got the Hawaiian fried rice, and sister got the red curry. I will note that the spicy scale is 1-10 and I wanted to be safe with my spiciness so I got a 1 the first time and 2 the second time and they were not spicy at all. If you want spicier food I suggest starting closer to 5. 

All of our dishes were delicious and we agreed it was better than we've had at other Thai restaurants in pittsburgh. I also recommend the ginger tea and green tea. The staff is super accommodating and we were surprised how fast we got our food both times. It is also byob which rocks. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place , family owned food is great service is even better , and they deliver , I always get the spicy shrimp salad it's the best"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in the city.

There isn't one complaint I have about this little place.  The hostess greeted us and gave us a choice of tables.  The waiter introduced himself and gave his recommendations on the menu.  We ordered an appetizer, meal, and dessert.  He did not rush our meal, which was fabulous.

Dessert....we had the mango with sticky rice...delicious.  This was a new item that I tried and I was pleasantly surprised.

There isn't much that will keep me away from this wonderful place."}
{"text":"I didn't quite realize how much I love Thai Cuisine until they closed for a few months to remodel. Their absence was deeply felt. Now that they are back in action, the restaurant is better than ever! It is now fully handicapped accessible, with a bright clean new dining room and multiple bathroom stalls. I was worried that the prices may increase due to the remodel, but no, they are the same. The food, also same, if not improved. The Tom Kha soup is as awesome as can be and our entrees were perfectly delicious. They still feature a separate vegetarian menu to make ordering easy. Most anything on the vegetarian menu is or can be vegan (just ask about egg - veg items do not contain fish sauce or shrimp paste). And the service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"Eaten here many times. Family run and they remember you so if you come back time and time again they start putting treats in your to go bag- weird treats though- like a brownie- but I'm not complaining. Food is good. Has sort of a Asian fusion menu actually but staple Thai items. Service is always friendly. Casual dress. Interesting interior with lots to look at on the walls.Good for groups. Good place for a relaxed dinner."}
{"text":"Why haven't I revewied Thai Cuisine before?! I was feeling ridiculously lazy tonight so I ordered delivery from them for the millionth time (available through Wheel Deliver, FYI) and I felt like they deserved some recognition since I have never had a negative experience here.

There isn't much to say about Thai Cuisine, really. The name says it all--straight-up, no frills Thai. They aren't trying to do anything creative or fusiony, they just make good food. First things first, I'm obsessed with fresh spring rolls so for a restaurant to become my primary Thai destination, it has to get those right. Thai Cuisine's are not the best I've ever had, but they are definitely up there as one of my favorites in Pittsburgh. Soft, fresh, and big...nothing's worse than a puny spring roll that is practically frozen from sitting in a refrigerator all day (ahem...Thai Place). So since Thai Cuisine passes the spring roll test, I can talk about their other food, which is all delicious. My favorite is the Pineapple Curry, but I've liked everything I've tried here. If you're one of those people who doesn't venture past Pad Thai, don't worry, that's good too. As a bonus, the portions here are pretty large so the prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get.

The most reliable Thai place I've found so far in the city (although I haven't tried them all yet)."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Thai restaurants in the country. The Pad Thai and Panang Chicken Curry are outstanding. The service is always friendly and welcoming, and the menu is complete. Crab fried rice is another favorite. Our favorite Thai spot in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine is neighbors with another pretty good Thai place right down the street, Thai Gourmet.  The competition is serious; both places have excellent food and both are a long way from pretentious dining.  After a few experiences at each, Thai Cuisine emerged as the winner.  This is mainly because 1) I had the lights turned out on me (twice) without warning at Thai Gourmet - as in \"hey we're closing but instead of telling you, we're just going to turn out the lights, hint hint\" and 2) I was served by a 10 year old on more than one occasion.  There's just something not right about a kid uncorking your wine tableside for you...  
So Thai Cuisine is the place.  Like others have said, the food is excellent, but what's great in addition to that is that the service is outstanding.  The staff are knowledgeable about the menu and make great recommendations.  They are patient and friendly in handling my annoying vegan questions and have a variety of mock meats to choose from, if that's your thing.  Keep an eye out for the mango sticky rice dessert - they only serve it in season!"}
{"text":"Good and friendly service. I ordered the crispy duck and it was sooo good. Not too greasy and nice and crispy. The hubby ordered beef noodle soup. Good flavor on that. Would definitely come back again. Thank you."}
{"text":"Maybe we just ordered the wrong items, but the pad thai and pad see ew were just seriously underwhelming. Oversauced, little flavor otherwise, and weird vegetables like canned corn made the meal forgettable somewhat hard to finish to be honest. The only reason we came over here was because Thai Gourmet was always closed and we just wanted a meal nearby. That said, Thai Gourmet has in my opinion a much more authentic feel to it, and we'll probably take more notice as to when it is actually open so as to avoid Thai Cuisine."}
{"text":"Ordered Tom Yum Goong soup.  Luckily the waitress asked my friend and I what level of heat we wanted.  We asked for medium and it was perfect.  Love that we could help ourselves to the egg rolls and chicken soup as well.  This was my second time there and I will be going back!  You can't beat the prices as well."}
{"text":"Having tried the gamut of Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, I always return to Thai Cuisine. The food is delicious, the service is friendly, prices are reasonable, and they're byob! My go-to is the pad see ew, with tom kha soup but their other noodle dishes and curries are great too."}
{"text":"Thai cuisine is my favorite place for: lunch, dinner, takeout, eat in, birthday, friends visiting from out of town, etc. BYOB, I often bring cans of beer and wine but I followed another Yelp reviewer's advice and brought a growler in and it was perfect with the spicy noodles. Spice level is 1-10 scale, I like about a 7 here and it doesn't make me cry so it's perfect! If you are in town go and check it out, the noodles are great, the curries are great and the green tea cheesecake is great!"}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine is always a treat. With so many mediocre thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, I think Thai Cuisine really stands out. I have ordered the curry, pad thai, and spicy noodles and they've all been good. I usually try to choose the mock duck as the protein because you can't get it at very many places and it is delicious! As for their service, it has always been good. Yelp is so funny. One person on here rated them very low and the \"worst thai\" in Pittsburgh but in their review saying they ordered \"general tsao's chicken\"... not sure if that is a joke but I don't think a person is qualified to be rating restaurants when they rate a thai restaurant on their Chinese food. SIGH. There should be some sort of test to rate places on Yelp. I've eaten thai a lot in many cities and Thai Cuisine is one of the better ones in Pittsburgh..."}
{"text":"Neighborhood restaurant.  Friendly service. Dishes can be a bit uneven. The honey duck, for instance, is dry, but the curry is good."}
{"text":"Living in Sunrise it is hard to find good food when the vast majority of your options are under Golden Arches or have a greasy value menu. I like this restaurant because it is well cooked Thai food served in an environment you actually want to sit in. As opposed to some other restaurants in the area which may have good food but I'd rather take it to go and not linger a moment longer than necessary for a pick up.
I love that they give you complimentary egg rolls with your meal in an age where nothing is free. The curries here are bomb. I have brought a couple of friends with me and this is generally the go to when we want curry. The chili mint fried rice with any meat is just a delicious flavor to experience. Their crab fried rice was a complete and utter miss for me. It was the one time I wish the portion was smaller because I did not want to finish it. This place is just a welcome spot in the food dessert that is Sunrise Mountain and it is greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and I can honestly say their food is great! I constantly eat there, order to go, and I get it delivered. I'm so glad my mom introduced my to this place!"}
{"text":"My husband had brought me back some delicious leftovers from this place when he was having a class on Nellis... I think it was yellow curry. (Even with good portion sizes, he sacrificed to not eat his whole meal so that I could have that taste.)

We had an errand to do on base yesterday and I was feeling Thai (like always), so he brought me last night. (This place is just over half an hour from Aliante.) My all-time favorite soup in the whole world is Tom Kah Gai, and so I deliberated over the many tasty-sounding options but went ahead and ordered it. I was worried it was only going to be regular bowl (like in the menu photo) for the 9 dollars and almost ordered a salad, too, but the server lady told me my soup came with rice so I didn't. My husband ordered the garlic and pepper beef. 

my soup came out first in one of those big hot pots, which thrilled me... so much soup! the server had given us small bowls, and I'd loaded up twice before my husband's food came out. the flavors of lime, coconut milk, bay, lemongrass, cilantro, and ginger were on point, even if my husband said the lemon was very strong. I am used to a slightly sweeter soup, but the complexity of flavors and the gently building heat were very enjoyable. (I had asked for medium to mild spice.). even with both of us having several bowls, I had an entire soup container to take home as leftovers. 

my husband was brave and had ordered off the very tasty curry menu, which I think he regretted. his beef was moist, but the garlic and spice were both rather mild, and that was after he'd asked for very spicy. there were a LOT of red pepper flakes, but I think my soup actually had more kick. 

service was deliberate and timely. 

I ordered Thai tea to-go without boboa (too full for tapioca), and it tasted the way it ought to."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch while at West Penn Hospital with a co-worker on a recommendation from someone else. I could not decide what I wanted so I went with a safe bet with Pad Thai with a 6 on the spice scale. I was a fan. It could've used a little more spice. I may try for an 8 on spice scale next time I go. Portions are very big and the price for the entire meal was very reasonable. 

Go get your noms on. :D"}
{"text":"This place is seriously a hidden gem. Duck and squid are delicious and pad Thai of course. I just wish they had a beer license for some Singha"}
{"text":"I ate at the Thai cuisine resturant on 2-26-2013.  It sets on the NW corner of Nellis and Bonanza.  I  arrived during lunch and there were several people eating but there was ample seating to chose from.  The place was clean and the service was prompt. I was brought a menu immediately and ordered a lunch special (Garlic Chicken) with a spicy level of 7.  I noticed a buffet type food cart and asked what it was and without answering she motioned for me to the cart.  There were spring rolls and soup that you could help yourself to.  (I took 2 spring rolls and a bowl of what looked like soup with chicken and Thai vegtables) Both were good, the soup a little mild, but good.  I noticed that a customer had returned to the cart and took 4 or 5 spring rolls and  Not knowing if it was allowed, I returned and got 2 more spring rolls when my order arrived.  I don't have any experience with Thai food and would not know how to compare this resturant to others but the food I ordered was good and although I ordered it to be a 7 on the spicy scale, I could have ordered an 8 or possibly a 9.  I would not drive a long distance to eat at this resturant, but if I was in the area, I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"Love this place the employees are always friendly and the food is amazing! We come here almost every week. Love the tom ka kai and the papaya salad and my sister loves the pad thai."}
{"text":"The *best* Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, hands down.

You see alot of new thai places pop up that serve you \"american thai\"... mild dishes from pre-made sauces and canned meat\ vegetables. This is not that place.

Great seating, with capacity for about 45 or so people. Great dinning area with access to windows allowing the sun in. Flexible hours, often open until 10\11 at night.

I've been here a few times now and each time has been consistently delicious. A friend and I enjoyed steamed dumpling, which were delicious but alittle pricey for 4 ($4.95). I enjoyed the Red Curry (Roasted Duck, Tomatoes, Bell Peppers, Basil Leaves and Pineapple in a Coconut Curry) which was amazing. All fresh ingredients cooked to order. I had mine at a 8/10 spice level, which had a slight kick but nothing too crazy, really it depends on who is cooking that day. My friend enjoyed the Yellow Curry (Chicken, Potatoes and Carrots in a Coconut Curry) which was just as great!

This place is great and is worth checking out. About $10 a plate and offers enough food to fill you for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Incredible lunch special. Terrific food, great service. Come eat here. I like spicy so I made mine a 7 and it was just right"}
{"text":"BYOB is best!  I brought homemade wine and it was lovely!

My first visit was unpleasant because the dish I ordered tasted like burnt noodles (apparently it was supposed to be that way though, so...I was willing to give it a 2nd chance).

My second visit was lovely!  The sweet and sour pork was delicious!  It was lighter than most sweet & sour dishes I've had previously - which are usually gooped up with thick syrupy sauce.  

Tom kha soup is one of my favorites, and theirs did not disappoint!  I would say that Thai Cuisine is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the 'burgh.

Will definitely come back.  First experience was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick and light lunch. The restaurant was very Clean. I was immediately greeted and seated and the service continued to be outstanding throughout my meal. A free appetizer of wontons and sauce was brought to my table which I thought was great even though I didn't care much for them. I got one of the specials, a spicy basil dish with chicken. It came with a small side salad with Peanut dressing which was terrible. I couldn't distinguish any basil in the main dish. It tasted like every other dish on an asian buffet and it was only luke warm. That made me suspect it had sat around for awhile and wasn't fresh because I was served quickly. If this is one of the best Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh as other reviewers have noted, then I won't be eating much Thai here..."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch. I don't exactly remember what I ordered because it was a few weeks ago but it was something like spicy basil noodles. It was truly excellent. The soba noodles were cooked great and the sauce was tasty. I ordered spicy level 5 but should have gone with something just a bit spicier. My fiance got a spicy basil rice dish but some of the vegetables in his rice were cold. Otherwise we really enjoyed the meal and I believe the lunch price was something like $6.95 or $7.95. The service was great and we had our waters refilled several times throughout the meal. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"After moving from SF to Denver about 1.5 years ago, I've missed good Thai food.  Luckily, I've found myself in Pittsburgh for a week for work.  I found Thai Cuisine on Yelp and loved it!  I took a short drive from my hotel, near CMU campus, across a bridge into a very authentic little Pittsburgh neighborhood.  As soon as I saw their special, Winter Curry, (Green Curry that includes Kabocha Squash, Zucchini, Potatoes, Carrots, Chicken), I was thrilled.  And, after tasting this scrumptiousness, I was hooked for life!  I gave 4 stars and not 5 only due to it not being an amazing environment...but for food only, definitely a 5 star!
Haven't left Pitt yet but already excited for a return trip for more yummy Thai!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh! The staff is incredibly friendly and the food is always great. Thai Cuisine will exceed your expectations."}
{"text":"First time to eat here! Dinner was delicious! Looking forward to returning for another yummy meal!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. I got the pulled pork buns which were wonderful. The dough is soft and savory, and the slice of cucumber cuts through the other flavors for a refreshing break. I got the red curry for an entree, as well. The salad was crisp, and the peanut dressing had just the right amount of kick. The curry itself was absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of coconut, and the basil mixed with the pineapple really worked well to balance out the spicyness."}
{"text":"I dream of the panang curry from thai cuisine. It's so delicious. 

Service here is great and ordering over the phone is a breeze. We start with thai iced teas which are sweet and delicious. The tom kah soup or dumplings are great to start. We get tom kah with veggies and extra spicy. It is so good. 

Like I said the panang curry is so good. It has lots of broccoli and we get it with chicken and veggies. It can get really spicy so be aware. The spicy basil noodles, spicy thai fried rice, and the pad se ew are other favorites! 

Take out is great- usually 20-30 minutes. Packed up and waiting for you. It's byob so if you eat in grab a six pack!"}
{"text":"Just awesome every time I come here and I can't finish the huge portions! Get drunken noodles! Love the larb beef!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food. We had a very large party and the weight staff was still so friendly. They gladly made me a vegan noodle dish which was great. I also got the Tom yum soup which I loved. It's BYOB which makes it a pretty cheap place. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Order date from grub hub and got a huge amount of food for a great price of course the free delivery and coupons helped. The pad Thai was amazing , fried rice was plentiful , and the beef was delicious. I diffently recommend this place ."}
{"text":"They have the best lunch specials around. 

It is a modified buffet. They have serve yourself Tom Yum soup, wontons and egg rolls. You order an entree. 

It is about $7. 

All entrees come with fried or white rice. 

I have tried everyone of the lunch specials. BUt the curry is the best. I get it spicy #5.

They make a sauce there that I have never had before. It is hot, sour, salty goodness. I have tried to find out what it is but there is a bit of a language barrier. 

The service is outstanding. Maybe it is because I go there all the time but they on the spot!"}
{"text":"My experience for this restaurant is from delivery only as I have never been to the actual location. I have never really tried Thai food before. My husband loves it and he convinced me to try it today. He picked this place based off of reviews and I am so happy he convinced me to step out of my comfort zone. The food was AMAZING! I seriously want to order from here once a week. We had Crab Rangoon, spring rolls, and spicy noodles with chicken. I loved everything! We decided on a spice level of 5 which was great. I would probably drop it to a 4 next time based on personal preference. The delivery driver was friendly and he arrived within 30 minutes which was 15 minutes prior to the quoted time. I have discovered the greatness of Thai food and I will be supporting this business A LOT in the future!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here!  I was contemplating whether to give it 4 stars but then I thought what could have been better and couldn't really think of anything.  The service was prompt and friendly - they were attentive without being annoying.  

I got what I usually get at Thai places - Spicy Basil Noodles and they were probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  I got a level 8 spicy and most of the time at other Thai establishments I'm disappointed in the lack of spiciness even when I get a level 8, but I can honestly say it was satisfactory level 8 spice worthy - which I truly appreciated.  

It was jumping for dinner and it's BYOB so stop by the wine and spirits store beforehand!"}
{"text":"This is a great Thai Food restaurant. I recommend this place if your in the Vegas area North side. Best kept secret, a must try spot. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Having eaten at plenty of authentic Thai restaurants, I can say that the food here is excellent and you won't be disappointed by stopping by.   Enjoyed the food, service and will most definitely come again"}
{"text":"Call me crazy but I had to leave the safety of my domicile to satisfy that \"ethnic\" pallet of mine.  Sixty mile a hour gusting winds and I took my family out to eat.  Yes, that it food dedication (or spoiled taste buds).  No harm came to me or my family in the making of this adventure.

We initially drove past this establishment trusting our hand dandy GPS to get us there the first time.  When we finally made the place out and fight our way through the winds we came into a nicely set up, friendly restaurant.  We seated ourselves.

We decided on the lunch special menu, which included a all you can eat soup and spring rolls.  Don't be fooled by the mere commonalty of spring rolls.  Their's were excellent.  So, crispy and full of cabbage and clear noodles.  There are two dipping sauces, the usual sweet/sour and then my favorite vinegar based w/hot peppers. 

We ordered:

Red curry spice level 7 -- Hmn, not spicy...where da spice?  
Yellow curry spice level 0 --  Kids said it was a little spicy.  Us grown ups thought otherwise. 
Mint chicken spice level 5 -- Had a Chinese food flavor to it.  Not bad but not what I was craving.  Spice level was good though.  I don't like it so hot that I can't taste my food just hot enough to make me breathe through my mouth.
Pad Thai -- I'm not a big fan of Pad Thai and this was just way too sweet for me.

For curry, I'll keep going to Pan Asian.  For everything else I tried...I can' live without.

Maybe, their other menu items are the true flare to the place.  I'll just never know that."}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine is a cozy and welcoming Thai spot on Liberty right in the middle of Bloomfield. I've walked by this place so many times, and I'm glad I finally made plans to eat here. 

When it comes to Thai food, I'm a bit of a broken record. I love Pad Sew and Pad Thai dishes, and typically insist the table gets at least one. Our table ordered the Pad See Ew, a calamari special, and I ordered a bowl of the Tom Yum Soup. 

The Pad See Ew was delicious, and felt like the perfect comfort food on a colder evening. We ordered it with veggies, and they were perfectly cooked--not too soggy, but also not too crunchy. I was pleasantly surprised by the Thai calamari we had, it wasn't something I'd typically order at a Thai place, but the sauce was awesome, and the little fried calamari's rivaled that of the best Italian places. The Tom Yum soup is soon to be my new go to dish. Once again, it has that feeling of comfort food. Judging on the proximity of this place to my house, I can tell I will be ordering this for take out often. 

We did something very out of character for the group and ordered dessert after eating. I'm not a sweets girl, but EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THE DESSERT HERE. I can't recommend the dessert rice dishes more, they were spectacular. We had one with rice and mango--it's almost like a sweet risotto. Their desserts rotate on a seasonal basis, but they typically will have a rice one on the menu. It's a unique flavor that can't be missed.

I'm sure I will be back again soon with a bottle of wine (BYOB), and an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food. We were short on time coming in and I was fresh off a rough day of work and en route to a breastfeeding class with my wife.    After a failed first entry in an Italian joint that wasn't going to cut it in 45 minutes or allow me to be awake after, we stopped here.   My wife and I both got curry, her a 2, me a 7 and it was great, I would recommend if you are in the area. I really needed a beer that day and they do not have any..and sit across from several places with great happy hours and microbrews...aw well, if you want good Thai Food in Bloomfield this is your place"}
{"text":"This place is legit. I had no idea it was around, until I consulted yelp during a recent, month-long asian dining binge. So far, I've tried the duck curry(YUM!!!) and red curry w/ chicken. The duck curry wasn't overcooked, which is often the case at other places, and had just enough fat(lots but not tons, lol). Mangoes weren't in season when I visited in January :-(  The menu looks very exciting. 

I'll be back :-)"}
{"text":"This place is so consistent ! Fast, fresh . How can I complain ? More importantly they are super nice and RESPECTFUL! Be careful though ...if you ask for spicy ...that's what you get ! Haha. Food quality & delivery on point ! Xo to this little gem !
So many yes's. Try the Green Curry, yellow curry with Tofu, &Tom Yum Veggie ."}
{"text":"I came to Thai cuisine when I was 18 and ordered take out once. I remember it being bad and vowing to never go back because there are so many good Thai places to eat at. Fast forward 8 years and my favorite place Lao Thai kitchen a crossed the street changed owners and went down hill.

Now rewind to a couple of weeks ago I decided to give them a chance and low and behold I'm a fan 8 years later. All the good Thai food is outside of east Las Vegas but this place is good! Keep in mind just with any type of cuisine there are many variations of dishes and this place resonated with me and my child hood.

I ordered take out chicken Yellow curry, pad se ewe, and tom kha gai. It was GOOD! The medium spice was perfect. Everything was really flavorful, full of protein, and cooked well. The veggies in the curry were kind of big but it made me feel like my mom made it.

We wound up dining here for dinner a few days later and ordered the same thing and it was just as good. The plateful of veggie egg rolls that they give on the house was a nice treat. Those take time to roll and I loved that nice touch of having them on the house although they weren't particularly good. Typical casual dining mom and pop Thai food prices which means affordable. The ladies working were super nice and I just fell in love with this place. I'm glad to have found a Thai place on the east side serving up big portions of good Thai food at a fair price.

I didn't get to check out the bathrooms, but this older restaurant did look dated. It was definitely clean and that's all that matters. I read some reviews about the cleanliness so maybe I just got lucky that night as it wasn't so busy.

Yes there are better Thai restaurants like Chada and Lotus, but this place is the perfect little Thai whole in the wall."}
{"text":"love this place. Take out or dine in - always good. Like that it's BYOB."}
{"text":"My mom and I walked in and ordered yellow curry chicken, edamame, spring rolls, and mango sticky rice to go. The hostess was very nice and our order was ready quickly. Everything we ordrred was absolutely delicious. We will definitely return next time we are in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai restaurant I have ever dined in. 

I always order the curry. It is my favorite dish even though I am sure the other items on their menu are just as great. They offer free spring rolls and a delicious soup made with chicken, tomato, and flavorful broth. The staff are always great, friendly; service is fast. Even Batman eats here."}
{"text":"Just recently did a delivery order. I placed my order through eat24. My order came 10 min after expected delivery time.  Which really isn't a big deal to me. I accidentally ordered the vegetable yellow curry (I usually get tofu) It tasted great. The problem was with the rice. It was old and very mushy. Didn't smell fresh. Might have been sitting in the cooker for awhile. I'm not sure. But it was disgusting. I hope this doesn't happen again."}
{"text":"I love Thai Cuisine!! It is probably my favorite place to eat. I usually get their pineapple curry and it is fabulous. The service is usually great and they are always quick to refill your water glass. It is not cheap, but it is worth every penny. I also love that it is BYOB. I would recommend that everyone go there!"}
{"text":"i love this place. they have a whole selection for vegetarian entrees. the food is always delivered fast and they give free egg rolls that are so yummy. there is no delivery fee, YAY. the food is always delicious. I've ordered a lot of different things & its always yum."}
{"text":"So I've never had Thai before. My best friend, Jess dragged me here on a Thursday night, and I'm SO glad she did. 

As I knew nothing about Thai, she ordered a Thai Iced Tea for me, and it was creamy and delicious. Kinda like a Yoo-Hoo and iced tea, minus the chocolate. I ordered a second one, even though it was extra. I didn't care. 


We ordered the special appetizer, Soft Shell Crab. So worth the splurge. It was perfectly cleaned, unlike what I've had from Wholey's before. There were two sauces accompanying the crab, and both suited it's crispness perfectly. 

Jess made a few suggestions on what to get for the entree, (our waitress was in training, but still was awesome) and I decided on the Param, because I love peanut sauce! You could customize how hot you wanted your dish, but I was being a sissy that night, and decided to go with a 3. It was perfect. Jess got Yellow Curry Shrimp. I ate half of hers, too.  Oops. I've also never had curry before. Oh my. So good. 

We sat and chatted for a while, and were kept care of well with refills on our water. They are a BYOB,  so next time, I'll bring some beer! 
  

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I only only give it a three because the food was great and spicy and had nice chill music but don't change your order staff will be rude. So honestly I give the food a ten but the waiter a five."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere, great service. The waiter was really on top of the water refills which is key for a place serving spicy food. Food was really good. They have a 1-10 scale for spiciness. I had a 4 with my dish and turned out perfect for me (not so spicy that I had to guzzle water, but enough to add to the flavor)."}
{"text":"Although they give you free eggrolls upon being seated the food here is awful!! Their Chicken Mongolian had absolutely no flavor and it almost tastes like it was about to go bad. We told the waiter and all she did was smile and blamed the sauce and offered to add more seasoning to it. Unfortunately that did not help and they offered nothing else. Very disappointed, won't be returning here again."}
{"text":"I love the takeout from here, but if you have a chance go for lunch during the week. They have a soup and eggroll bar that is free with your order in the restaurant. It is fantastic when you get too spicy an entree. lol. I know it is a family run business and the service is always great."}
{"text":"So I was delighted by the \"jams\" playing as soon as I entered the restaurant. Being Asian it made me feel quite at home and in my element. With that said I knew I was in for some authentic cuisine. 

We ordered the fried squid and cashew shrimp. Both weren't too bad although I will have to say I've had better Thai food elsewhere. 

But the jamzzzzz man. And all the hardcore accents from the staff, can't top that! Lol"}
{"text":"As the saying goes, when one Thai food door closes, another Thai food door opens...

It was Sunday afternoon. We were hungry and we wanted Thai. We walked up to Thai Gourmet, our usual go-to Thai spot, and were greeted by a \"closed\" sign on the door. They don't open until 5 on Sundays?!  But I want Thai food NOWWWWW (feeling very Veruca Salt that day). Dejected, I walked my rumbly tummy up Liberty Ave, and lo and behold, another Thai restaurant appears a few blocks up. Whine and ye shall receive.

After perusing the menu, we decide to take out some chicken pad thai and another dish called \"three flavored chicken.\" Both solid choices. The pad thai portion was huge and chock full of the good stuff (they did not skimp on the meat or veggies in here!)  The sauce was flavorful and plentiful, yet light...not overly thick, oily, or sticky, as some pad thai sauces can be. The \"three flavored chicken\" was also tasty with its crispy, breaded chunks of white meat chicken. The sauce was interesting and unlike anything I've ever had before. Despite its name, I really only tasted two flavors that dominated the sauce -- vinegar (sour) and sugar (sweet). It could have used some spice to round it out, but even so, it was still delicious. I do wish it had some broccoli or other vegetable in it so I at least felt a little less guilty about eating copious amounts of fried chicken chunks :)  And overall, for our tastes, both dishes definitely could have kicked up the spice intensity. We had ordered both at a level 8, and as I said, I couldn't really detect any spice at all. So if that was an 8, next time I'll probably order a 33. :)

Overall, this is very yummy Thai food. I'm not sure that it will replace my usual go-to Thai spot, but it'll definitely be high on my list!"}
{"text":"Okay Thai food, nothing special, and overpriced. Ordered the eggplant with shrimp, veggie fried rice, and chicken satay. Eggplant was okay but lacked adequate quantities of shrimp. The veggie fried rice and chicken satay were both substandard as far as other Thai food restaurants in the area. It is pricier than most other Thai places in the area and based on the quality, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered honey duck, yellow curry, and three flavor chicken, tom yum shrimp. The price on the menu looked fine. However, when the food came, I was disappointed with the portion. 
And also, you can choose brown rice instead of white rice. But remember brown rice will cost 1 dollar extra. The server did not tell us before we made that selection. 
The size of the restaurant is not spacious. So it's not really a good place for a big group to go. 
Overall, the food taste fine. But it's won't be my to go place next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant. Yaaaaaaaaas. As I've mentioned in previous reviews, I'm not really big on Asian cuisine. Lots of my friends always rave about it (Thai Cuisine specifically), so I figured I'd give in and try it. Being one of my first Thai restaurants that I tried a few years ago, I instantly became hooked and it's one of my favorite places to hit up for Thai! 

The atmosphere and warm and the owners are always very pleasant. It's also BYOB which is an automatic win!

Their menu is huge. I typically always get something chicken related. Never once have I had a bad meal. The portions are always decent as well."}
{"text":"Worst Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. Ordered Gen. Tao's chicken and it tasted like sweet and sour. Wonton soup broth was so weak it was like slurping soggy noodles in tepid water. I'll never order from here again. Better to go to Thai Gourmet down the street."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. 

This place has been apart of my childhood. Nice staff, great food, and they got new menu and is great Thai place."}
{"text":"BEST Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, without a doubt! Whenever we have the craving, we drive down here from Youngstown just for this place! 

The hostess and serve staff are always friendly, available, and quick to refill your water glass. And the food is always top quality. My personal favorite is their Pad Thai. The ingredients are fresh, the sauce is very flavorful, and no matter what spice level you choose, it's always delicious. We usually order a second serving to take home for during the week!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken PadThai with a vegetable spicy soup. Pad Thai lacked in flavor and was too dry. If they can't even get the flavor going, it pretty much describes their whole menu. Will no be back."}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine was very good and might be deserving of 5 stars but I have only been there once and there were a couple of items that knocked it down to 4.

I started with Tom Yum Veggie, it was loaded wit LOTS of fresh vegetables, the broth had a little too much lime in it for me and the idea of adding extra heat with chili flakes was okay but overall the broth lacked any sort of flavor outside of base, lime, chili flakes. 

I had the Spciy Basill Noodles, this dish was excellent very similar to Pad Kee Mao but it had egg and bell pepper in it. This dish alone deserved 5 stars.

My only other critique is that I had ginger tea and it was westernized version, on the sweet side and lacking the spiciness of true ginger tea.

With my little nit-picks aside I currently highly recommend this dining establishment, not that they need much help, they were very busy as they should be - go enjoy."}
{"text":"fyi--no delivery!  still good for our purposes--carry out friday night.  

RED CURRY soaked in sugar (but that's what makes it authentic!)
PAD THAI passable but skimped on the green onions (definitely more authentic compared to whatever it is they call pad thai at Lulu's Noodles)
YUM YAI salad nothing special but the SAUCE hit the spot
TOM KHA GHA too heavy on the oil compared to better versions in my memory

for the price and proximity, will return probably for another carry out friday night but will probably head somewhere else if dining-in!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has okay Thai food with good service, but was nothing out of this world. I shared the papaya salad, red chicken curry, and a beef vegetable dish. The papaya salad was very spicy and quite good. The red curry was just okay as the sauce was not very thick, there was no Thai basil with the dish, and it mostly had bamboo shoots with nothing else for vegetables. The beef was very bland. I tried to like it, but not even the vegetables were good. Still the prices weren't bad, the service was prompt and good. Parking was a cinch."}
{"text":"Quality Thai/Chinese food and great customer service at reasonable prices.  Even a BETTER value for lunch! 

So, the other night, I was in the mood for something Asian to eat for dinner.  So, I consulted YELP* once again and \"Thai Cuisine\" was the first restaurant in my area to pull up.  \"That's exactly what I've been looking for,\" I thought to myself...a good Asian restaurant on the North East Side of Vegas.  I usually have to drive a distance to my other favorite spots...

Wanting to stay close, I made my way to \"Thai Cuisine.\"  They greeted me at the door (EVERYONE DID, they're very nice that way...) and the first thing I noticed was their EXTENSIVE menu.  Apparently, they serve BOTH Thai AND Chinese food, so their selection is 120+ items.

I have to admit, when I read another person's YELP* review, I was curious about their notation that \"Thai Cuisine\" immediately serves your beverage choice and four COMPLIMENTARY egg rolls (nice) BEFORE they take your order.  Those same egg rolls are priced at $5.95 (for 5 pieces) on the menu, which makes this free appetizer a nice added value to anyone's meal--and a smart loss leader for \"Thai Cuisine\" to draw is customers back in again.  Who doesn't like egg rolls, and who doesn't like \"free anything\"  lol

As for the food, I thought I might choose my old standard, which is pad thai.  But this time I chose the Coconut Chicken Soup (Tom Kha Gai), which is served with a large generous bowl of jasmine rice.  And I'm glad I did!  I've eaten this dish before overseas and when I ate it again this time, it tasted better.  The base of this soup is chicken stock, coconut milk and a little lime juice, which gives it a slight sourness.  Then, the chef added plump tomato pieces, whole straw mushrooms, whole lime leaves, chopped fresh lemongrass pieces, fresh chopped cilantro leaves, a little oyster sauce and little hot sauce to taste.  What a complex range of flavors!  When Ladled over some jasmine rice, the portion is enough for three to four people (or great for leftovers).

Overall, I'm a fan of \"Thai Cuisine\" and will DEFINITELY return.  In MY BOOK, when quality food meets great customer service and a reasonable price, that gets high marks.

                            **READ THE FOLLOWING INTERESTING NOTE:**  
Although the restaurant closes at 10:00pm, I noticed a group of four people walking in around 9:45pm.  As many Americans believe expect restaurants will still seat them up to the posted close of business (so as not to lose the revenue), what these people didn't realize is that, for MANY Asian restaurants, the POSTED closing time is when the staff walks out the door...lol.  So, the manager offered to prepare the group something \"to go,\" but they declined and apologized for showing up so late.  As a gracious and generous response, the manager told the group \"wait a minute, I don't want you to leave hungry...let me send you home with some complimentary egg rolls.\"  WOW.  Nice touch.  The group was impressed and promised to return with their entire family soon.

As I finished eating my meal, at 10:00pm EXACTLY, the television set was switched off, the cook walked out the door, half of the overhead lights were cut off and my check was laid on the table.  Having traveled through Asia extensively, I've witnessed this tradition quite often.  People aren't usually permitted to \"chat\" over endless cups of coffee in Asia as they often are here in the U.S.A.  If our culture would only embrace this value.


                                           *** ONE LAST THOUGHT: ***   
Check out \"Thai Cuisine's\" lunch menu, which is offered from 10:30am to 3:00pm daily.  They offer combination specials VERY reasonable prices! (about 30% off the dinner menu prices)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a long time, but finally got around to doing so today with my son.  I was surprised that they offered their lunch specials on a weekend, as many places do not.  So, that was a plus.
  We were greeted as soon as we walked in by a very friendly waitress.   She asked if we had ever been there before, and when we said \"no\" she gave us a short summary of the menu.  That was nice.
  The lunch specials included choice of white or fried rice, soup, and eggroll.  I ordered the red curry chicken.... spicy level 5 (medium).   The food arrived quickly and was nicely presented.  We were a little surprised that the portions were rather small, though.  But most importantly it was delicious!  It was enough to fill us up, but other Thai/Chinese restaurants have given us more.
  It's not a fancy place, but prices are reasonable, service was great, and the food tasted yummy.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Hands down a great thai restaurant.   I ordered the Tom Yum Veggie Soup because of all the yelper's great experience, however, I thought the soup had a bit too much lemon juice.  Aside from that, my husband and I enjoyed a great meal.  We ordered the Fresh Tofu Roll, Spicy Beef Basils and Chicken Pad Thai.  It seems that no one talks about this number system of how spicey they should make your food.  The waiter asks if how spicey it should be from 1 to 10 (being the hottest).  We picked a number 4 and the Spicy Beef Basils was still very spicy.  The Pad Thai was delicious and amazing.  All together our bill came out to be $32.  We will definitely go here again very soon!"}
{"text":"Lec is running an amazing family business. The food is always very delicious. My favorite is the Coconut Shrimp Soup, Thai Tea & Kung Pao Tofu :) 
p.s. Lunch special is the way to go! Free egg rolls & chicken Thai soup with an entrée & fried/white rice."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm not too adventurous with Thai, but everything I've had has been excellent: Pad See-Ow, Spicy Noodles, Pad Thai."}
{"text":"I've tried to give them a couple tries but its consistently bad. I cant speak for the curry but the noodle dishes and appetizers I've had are bad.

Tonight we ordered pad thai, pad see ew and the fresh thai cuisine rolls...

The noodles were mostly tasteless and greasy. The spring rolls were filled with ice berg lettuce and they literally sliced the shrimp in half that they put inside.

35 dollars for 2 tastless noodle dishes and an app of iceberg lettuce is a bit much. 

Go to Thai Gourmet or Noodlehead. Bigger portions, cheaper, and way better tasting."}
{"text":"I asked around Yelp to see what the best Pad Thai in the city was and a lot of people said Thai Cuisine. To my surprise I ended up moving a block away from the place. I go here once or twice a week to get the Pad Thai. Yeah, I could live off Thai food. The pad tha0i is delicious! So is the fried goyza. Try it! Seriously. The portions are so large that the pad thai lasts me a couple meals."}
{"text":"Went here last week and it was good. Nothing special, but good.

If you're looking for a reasonable and inexpensive thai meal, head here. 

If I could, I'd give it a 3.5."}
{"text":"First of all, despite my hatred for PF Changs, I love their lettuce wraps. I'd do dirty, horrible things for their lettuce wraps. These lettuce wraps were not PF Changs lettuce wraps. The search for PF Changs comparable lettuce wraps continues. 

Besides that, the food was okay, nothing out of the ordinary for Thai food, but it was a little overpriced for the servings that they were offering as well as the quality."}
{"text":"Would rate the food a B/B-, value is a B as well. Flavors are either bland or too sweet... However, I DID have the soup on several occasions and would rate it a solid B+. Ambiance is a B+ as well. Staff is always nice and it's easy to get a table. However, wouldn't say this is very authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"I've eatien at thai cuisine for over 20 years. I like the way they have improved there Decor, it is very clean and comfortable. After being seated you will be presented with complimentary egg rolls , very tasty!

You staff works hard to keep everything clean and in order with a very friendly attitude. 

Clean, comfortable good food, friendly staff. What more do you ask for? 

5 stars ."}
{"text":"For a time in Pittsburgh, I lived within walking distance of Thai Cuisine and frequented this spot on the regular. It was never usually crowded upon my visits, but after walking by multiple times after moving from Bloomfield, it looked like they had a steady stream of customers each time when I passed. One of my favorite things about many restaurants in Pittsburgh is the BYOB-so economical and allows you to bring a wine that you already know you will enjoy in addition to having paid about 1/3 or more less than what one would pay at a restaurant. 

The decor is modest but service has always been warm and efficient. I definitely enjoyed the booths which I find less and less at ethnic restaurants. What you are really here, though, is for the food. I've tried a variety of options here over time: the thai spring rolls (crunchy, sufficient veggie filling), the mixed vegetables with chicken, the spicy basil with chicken (spicy but not overwhelming for my palate), the pad thai with chicken (saucy, noddles cooked perfectly, generous portion of chicken), and the spicy basil noodles with chicken (at a 7 this was perfect for me and provided some heat without overdoing it-very flavorful). 

I'd definitely recommend dining at Thai Cuisine for a delicious Thai meal! Parking on the street can be difficult; I recommend the pay parking lot around the corner from the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple years. The staff is extremely friendly. The food is excellent. I love the yellow curry."}
{"text":"I very rarely try Thai food, probably because I feel like an 62 year old person who is afraid of change but at the same time can barely work an iPhone.

But I finally got around trying Thai, and I must say that this is a pretty solid establishment.  There is a nice open feel when you enter the restaurant, my girlfriend says this is really authentic Thai food so I guess I will have to say based on that, I love Thai!  

I tried the chicken curry and some duck fried rice with yellow curry?  I'm still a Thai newb so pardon my ignorance.  Either way, it was definitely different and it was pretty adequately priced.

I want to give this place 5 stars, but I get gun shy when it comes to perfection.  I'll go to other Thai places down the road and might come back to this one to do an updated review.

I had no problem with the service, they gave us some free eggrolls as well.  Good stuff.  There was also a lady who fell over a table when she arrived in the store, looking back that probably was hysterical.

Sorry Yelpers, no real interesting stories here.  Just a solid establishment

{"text":"Wow, yes, a place that delivers to my house that is NOT pizza. 

Ordered Chicken Curry (yellow, medium) and a Thai Salad (pretty basic), and I got the complimentary egg rolls with the delivery order.

Curry was all right. Not the best I have had, but maybe they do it better in the store? I can't imagine it would be all that different though because it seems as though the moment I put in my order it magically appeared at my door. Yes, that fast I tell you! By the way, delivery charge was... FREE! Yes, I ordered off of Eat24 and this was the only place around me that was not charging a delivery fee.

My Thai Salad was good, lots of tomatoes and cucumbers. Very fresh and of course a nice compliment to the curry. I like to eat the salad and curry at the same time. It just seems to cleanse the palette so you don't have spicy, spicy coming at you the entire time.

The egg rolls were quite yummy. I like to dip them in the spicy chili sauce - I wish they'd given me more instead of bringing a cup of the sweeter sauce. 

Overall I loooooved my food, right in the comfort of my own living room."}
{"text":"We order delivery from them all the time and every single time THEY TAKE FOREVER!!! On the upside, the food always comes hot and yummy!! So I guess it makes up for the hour of wait. The delivery guys were always nice and friendly, too. So be sure to tip them good! Just don't order from them if you're super hungry. You might die from starvation.

Also, the \"1-10\" spiciness scale is a lie. No matter how high or low I choose. The spice still burns my tongue off. Choose 0. They will still give you a tinnie tiny bit of spice."}
{"text":"This was some of the tastiest Thai food I've had in LV. The chicken coconut soup was really great and served in a bowl with a small active volcano in the middle to keep it hot. They brought us a double order of egg rolls-we only ordered one. My wife had yellow curry that was great, my one complaint being that the curry broth was a little too white and had just a hint of \"curry\" flavor. Also there wasn't quite enough of the broth that I am used to with other places. It was more thick like a sauce. These are minor complaints about the dish as overall it was quite good. We will definitely go back! 

Ignore what your GPS says-it is on the Northwest corner of Pecos and Nellis. My GPS is nearly 10 years old though....."}
{"text":"Oh my, Thai Cuisine, how I miss living a few blocks from you.  
This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I couldn't even begin to count the number of times that I have been to this place. I mean it when I say everything is delicious.  I have had multiple curries, noodles, and apps, and none have disappointed.
A few of my favorites, Chicken Dumplings (steamed or fried), Thai Spring Rolls, Pad Thai (naturally), Thai Cuisine Bird Nest, and Spicy Basil Noodles.  
Service here is always on point, even when they're busy.  This place is BYOB, so bring your favorite adult bevie and enjoy. While a smaller restaurant, they happily can accommodate larger parties. 
While they don't deliver, you can get take out, so you can bring home a yummy Thai treat.

I need to go here again asap!!! :)"}
{"text":"Leaning more towards 3.5, but that isn't currently an option...

I went here with a group on a Saturday night during Little Italy Days. I've tried getting in here before on a Saturday night and was turned away because they were so full so close to closing time, so I was thankful to find empty tables and room enough for our party of 6.  

As one reviewer said before, the service was very attentive. I'd rather have a server who checks up on me too much than one who disappears for 40 minutes though, so it was no bother. I cannot complain at all about the service during the meal...she was prompt and very attentive and a water glass was never empty the entire time.

Straying away from my usual green curry, I got the spicy noodle dish at a level 5 out of 10. I can honestly say the noodle dish didn't have that much of a kick at all and despite being delicious on it's own, I added a good amount of sriracha to it. 

Another dining companion said his curry wasn't hot enough either and he ordered an 8 out of 10, but he's also an absolute sadist when it comes to spice. The food was mediocre. Not the best thai I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. 
 I tried a piece of my friend's honey duck and it was absolutely delicious. Another diner was pretty \"meh\" about her dish as well and didn't finish it, but I liked what I had despite it not being hot enough. I would certainly come back during lunch and give this place another try.

Main problem came at the end with the check. We were a group of 6 and were told they couldn't split the check (which I expected) but they could take up to three forms of payment. No problem, we dividied up the bill according to who got what and told her which card goes with which dish. 

We were then told that we have to give her the exact amount we wanted charged on each card and it had to all equal up to the total on the bill. That may sound simple, but with tax and gratuity it was RIDICULOUS sitting there like I was in math class working out who was going to charge what on their card. Left a sour taste in my mouth, as any modern day POS system could have done in seconds what I spent the better part of 10 minutes trying to figure out. Didn't help that she gave us 'tude about it, either. 

Anywho, I may come back and try it, but certainly never in a large group format again."}
{"text":"Really really good !
Just moved to East Vegas, wanted a good restaurant ! Found one.  
Had:
Crab Cheese Rangoons (delish)
Chicken Satay (fabulous)
Chicken Yellow Curry (perfect taste & after taste)
Spicy Mint pork with lots of veggies, spice level 4 (sooo good)

I will definitely return ! This was a great experience & the staff was superb.
Plus they comped us wonton rolls that were sooo good."}
{"text":"Stay away from the lunch special and soup bar. I usually order from the menu where they prepare the food better. Get the seafood tom yum soup , and combination fried rice with Thai ice tea"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and it is actually very good. I'm extremely judgmental when it comes to thai food and though the food wasn't perfect (but it was satisfying) i'm still going to give it four stars because I have yet to find a better thai place in Pittsburgh that isn't a murderously long drive away from our house."}
{"text":"July 11 2015; we came in this coconut aroma place craving for thai food taste. Since me and the hubby want to keep the carbs low, we ordered chicken satay, fried squid and tomyum soup.the chicken satay taste amazing. It has cucumber salad and peanut sauce that goes well with it. The breaded squid with sweet and sour sauce taste superb. It didn't taste oily at all. The Tomyum soup is very delicious that it will make you feel rejuvenated after you eat it. This place is worth a try if you're looking for thai food restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for fantastic chicken satay! Oh and their taro boba was a ok a bit on the sweet side though for my taste. The watermelon boba Tasted better than I thought! I will be going back! Oh brought back the satay for my family that said a party was in their mouth lol"}
{"text":"Took a friend to chow down at this thai restaurant. 

PROS: Have had the pad thai, wide noodles w/ black bean sauce, and mango curry here. All were good. The front desk was very welcoming. Decent prices ($10- 12/dish). They also have a daily specials menu, at least for dinner.  

CONS: Crab rangoon was overfried- wouldn't recommend this appetizer. Side street parking. 

Overall, will be back to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I have tried every Thai place I can get my hands on and none compare to the quality of flavor and balance at Thai Cuisine. The family that owns it runs it and how much they care shows. I usually order Penang curry tofu or a dish that's not on the menu tofu noodle soup. Lunch specials are a good deal too."}
{"text":"We've been eating at Thai Cuisine since it opened many, many years ago. The food was great but, in all honesty the food has been on the decline...you want specifics? here they are: We ordered the Tom Yum Veggie Soup (we ordered the Hot Pot, which technically they no longer have but gave us 3 orders of the soup). guess how many pieces of tofu were in each bowl of soup....4? 3? 2? Nope. 1. So, I called and they refunded one of the cups of soup ($3.50)- honestly, i don't think this was the best remedy but, whatever. My eggplant with tofu had exactly 6 small pieces of tofu. Now, let's be real, tofu is CHEAP. the asian food store in the strip sells blocks of it for less than 30 cents...and those blocks make up 6 pieces o' tofu thai cuisine style...so, please explain this one....anyway, i'm just not happy with the price of the dishes and what's inside...it's really the beginning of the end when restaurants get this high on themselves."}
{"text":"Best Thai spot I've ate so far. Just moved to Vegas and I been here 3 times already! Great food and Service!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places, maybe ever.  Fresh, sweet, spicy and all around good.  Not super heavy or cloying sweet.  Friendly service and all at a fair price.  

I hate hearing my neighbors, though."}
{"text":"Called to order for delivery to get my thai fix. Guy on the phone was really friendly. Im only about a mile away from them. Delivery was fast. My food came in like 30mins. Pad thai was ok. Egg rolls has barely anything on it. :( Fried squid, drenched in oil. It sucks that my favorite thai restuarant (Arawan and Thai St. Cafe) are far from where I live. 

2 stars for the service.
1 star for food."}
{"text":"I love this place the pineapple fried rice is delicious we always order for delivery and our experience has been great a good amount of food excellent taste great delivery time thank you guys for providing awesome food this is my to go spot for Thai food cravings awesome"}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving Thai food. Unfortunately, we don't have many choices in the North East side of town. We are regulars @ Archis Thai Bistro but since we did not want to drive way across town we decided to give this place a try.

I called and placed an order for take-out... we each ordered Shrimp Pad-Thai, an order of Egg Rolls, Crab Ragoons and Thai Tea. 

I rate the Shrimp Pad-Thai a 3/5 it was pretty bland- my husband enjoyed it but he is not as picky as I am
Egg Rolls 2/5 I can get better ones at Costco 
Crab Ragoons 3/5 
Thai tea 5/5!!!"}
{"text":"Literally a hidden gem! I live in Henderson, so it's a bit of a drive, but it's always worth it. The food is above and beyond, absolutely delicious. I've had chicken, curry, seafood, and beef dishes and I've never once been let down. The seafood soup is to die for! This is an awesome little family-run business where you will not be let down!"}
{"text":"Ordered food to go from here for our first visit. The staff was nice and kept checking on us ti see if we were ready to order (we took a while to decide). The coconut chicken soup was ok. Horribly sour if you ask me, there has to be better elsewhere. The egg rolls left me wanting better, but they were free so I cannot knock them for these. The rest of our food was great. We ordered fried rice and broccoli and beef for the people not introduced to thai food yet and they loved the flavor. 

The pork red curry we ordered was good; I would order again but will order medium spice. 

The star of the order was the Pad Thai (medium spice). Best flavored Pad Thai I have ever had, definitely good if you are introducing someone to Thai food.

The amount of food we got for the price was decent. We are still eating the leftovers!

...oh yeah almost forgot....Thai Iced Tea is cheap and good here ($2 vs normally $4)! If you have never had it, try it. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm not so much ...




I would rate it 4 or maybe 5 stars but sadly they completely got our order wrong. We asked for no meat pineapple  fried rice and somehow there is egg chicken and shrimp.  I don't mean to be rude but seriously ?  Even though it was wrong the shrimp was overly cooked and the Pad Thai noodles felt like they were just microwaved.  Maybe we happened to order on there bad day but today I am not impressed .

Pros : very fast in delivery & desserts are the best."}
{"text":"First dining at Thai Cuisine was very enjoyable! We ordered the three sauce (?) chicken and spicy basil chicken fried rice - excellent flavors and great portions. Can't wait to try again!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst Thai food I've ever had. People need to stop claiming this place is a \"hidden gem\".

Orderd crab rangoon and some pad thai. The pad thai could have duck added, so I decided to try that instead of the shrimp I normally get in pad thai.

Both dishes came out at the same time, nothing wrong with that, but I went with the appetizer first. The crab rangoon was frozen throughout, no cream cheese, completely filled with imitation crab. The cherry on top being that it had a horrible taste. A combination of extremely old dirty cooking oil and a flavor of the imitation crab being old to the point of spoilage.

The pad thai, while edible, didn't have any real flavor. The duck, tasted more of pork, and was extremely dry, almost to the point of being chewy.

The food is hot garbage. I should have saved my money and went to thai places that have given me consistently awesome food for years: Weerai Thai and Lotus of Siam.

Don't come here, let my bad experience be a sacrificial warning for you."}
{"text":"The BF and I have been here a couple of times, both for lunch. Both times we each had the same thing and each had a great lunch. He gets the eggplant & vegetables, which is very, very good, and I get the (surprise!) pad Thai with chicken. Both come with a little salad with a scrumptious peanut dressing. Even though I know I like the eggplant, and pick out half his vegetables- mmmmm, veggies- I can't order anything but the pad Thai I can't help it. I love it. The only change up in our routine the second time around was we ordered the pork buns. And I cannot tell you what a great move that was! They were seriously better than Noodleheads' buns, and I know that sounds sacrilegious, but they were!  

Service has always been great as well. Now, we are here at lunch, and it has always been slow. I think that's just how it is in Bloomfield at that hour. Either way, everyone is polite and attentive, and the food comes in a very timely fashion. 
All around, I really like this place for our mid-week-bite-for-lunch spot. 

And after you have a great lunch, you can walk down to Paddy Cake Bakery and have a delicious thumbprint cookie. Mmmmmm.....

*For all you alcohol consumers out there, it is BYOB with a cork (ing?) charge of $1.00. or however you say that...."}
{"text":"There food is delicious!
This is a dive. 
It is not a place to go in order to dinner in and impress.

This is one of the few places where I tend to get the same dish.
Spicy chili mint chicken lunch is delicious.
Have tried the orange chicken which I did not enjoy.
Had a couple different soups which will fill you up.
I was expecting there kuay jub to be like a pho but it is definitely not. It is very earthy and flavorful with a lot of good bits and pieces.
The wor wonton is very good too."}
{"text":"I've eaten in the restaurant and was looking for some of the same food when I ordered!  I threw the sweet and sour pork away because it looked like it was boiled in slight pink and red food coloring, and was tasteless! the Mongolian beef was boiled in plain water and rubbery!  the only thing halfway edible was the egg roll.  the food there was great when I was in the restaurant ! soups are awesome, presentation was bar none the best with the round soup bowl with a flame in the middle, but I will never order for Home Take out there again!"}
{"text":"Ordered  a cat fish soup that had nothing but potatoes and mushroooms.. with a few small little pieces of fish floating around. I'm very disappointed in this place.

Every single time we order something from this place something is off or not good."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had, customer service is amazing. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great prices, great food. They always remember me and set a plate of spring rolls in front of me as soon as I sit down. Great pad-thai and seafood soup."}
{"text":"This is my local Thai food place. It's not necessarily my favorite, or the best around but here's why I like it:

-It's good. I've liked everything I've ordered.
-It's dependable. Things are consistently good, and I order here fairly often.
-They usually get the spice right (of what you ask for on a scale of 1-10)
- It's better than the other one that is a block away. I don't know what other people have to say about this because I hear conflicting opinions of Thai Cuisine and Thai Gourmet, but I have tried them both and can say that I just like this one more. 

My favorite dish is the green curry. Most veg packed and the tofu option is a great combination (I'm not a veg, but I eat veg often). I really like the way their tofu is steamed, its creamy and delicious in the thin curry sauce. I usually prefer a thicker curry but something about this curry really works as a thin texture - pretty soupy. But it's light and delicious and I am usually drinking it out of the bottom of my bowl like soup. 

I get take-out here quite often, and it is always ready fairly quickly, but I really wish they would deliver so I would not have to move my lazy, hungover ass out of my house. 

The dining experience is OK. BYOB is a great plus, but the interior leaves a lot to be desired. The service is always great. Friendly and accommodating and the manager is always there to greet with a smile."}
{"text":"Very good lunch specials with unlimited egg rolls and soup when you dine in. The soup is always a bit too salty for my liking but the egg rolls are excellent. The other dishes, however, can be hit or miss. Tried the non lunch special beef pad see ew, which tastes pretty much the same no matter where you go, but it was overly greasy and I did not care for it. The service is always awesome though! But it can be a bit slow as they can be short staffed."}
{"text":"I have tried a few of what have been called the best Thai restaurants in this city. But hands down Thai Cuisine checks all the boxes. First, when you order your spice level they do not play, and 8 will be an 8. Full of flavor and hearty portion sizes. Their lunch special is a great deal."}
{"text":"As an expatriate of Pgh, Thai Cuisine was an unexpected gem in the middle of the city.  I have found very little in my current venue of Boston which compares well.

The prices are extremely reasonable, and the seating is intimate. The cuisine is extremely authentic (especially for being Pittsburgh) and is suited from picky eaters to foodies."}
{"text":"The environment is nice, and the lady who always does my takeout is the nicest person ever, but their dishes are hit or miss.

5 stars for their spicy basil fried rice, which is out-of-this-world good.  It's what I order every time I get takeout from here.

Nothing else I've tried here has really wow'ed me.  In particular, the flavor of their duck curry (from the specials menu) is nice but the duck itself was too fatty and very underwhelming, and their rendition of massaman curry is far too watery.

One nice thing about this place is that they do offer gluten-free versions of many dishes!"}
{"text":"Read the review on yelp before I decided to pop in. I mean, what kind of name is this restaurant. Thai cuisine??? Straight up thai food, nothing extra like Yai or Jasmine or Lotus. Straight up, thai cuisine. Well, their food was bomb.

Pop in for a nice little lunch snack with my lady and this place is pretty decent for the area. If you think you have to go all the way to chinatown to get a decent thai food. Think again! This place pretty bomb diggity when it comes to thai food. Love their pad thai and their free egg rolls. Did you know that you can get extra soup too if you want. You just have to get it yourself buffet style."}
{"text":"Average Thai food. Not the best but not the worst. If you want Thai food it is worth considering this place!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of thai food...  Being asian i have an affinity for food from the far east...  I had the pad thai here...  I ordered it at a 7 in terms on spicyness... I have to say it was a little too strong for my tastes,, kinda killed the other flavors of the dish...  The lady that took the order was very nice... I just ordered the pad thai,, and she threw in an order of Spring Rolls which were tasty.. Not like my mom's or aunt but it was good...  I would recommend the pad thai from here.... I will eat here again for sure... Good solid food, good portions, served with a smile,,, what more could you ask for... Thank you"}
{"text":"I've been eating here and getting delivery via Wheel Deliver for years. Discovered it on a fluke when the nearby restaurant we'd planned on dining at had a thirty minute wait. My favorite go-to dish is the Roast Duck Curry entree, with a spice level of four. After reading other reviews I'll have to expand my horizons and try a few other things. On that first visit (since we hadn't planned on eating there) the name of the restaurant never registered with me, so I just started referring to it as 'Bangkok Orgasm'.  Nuf said!

Update 9/6/13: I still love this restaurant and stand by my five stars, but I will not order via Wheel Deliver anymore. I am convinced that although I specify the spice level in my online order that it does not get conveyed to Thai Cuisine by Wheel Deliver. I have had some disappointingly bland orders of roast duck curry, and this has never happened when I have eaten at the restaurant or stopped by for take-out and placed my order in person."}
{"text":"When I first started ordering from this place, delivery was a reasonable time. Now it takes forever. I like this place and my kids do as well. But I'm beginning to wonder if I should find a new place because of the time for delivery."}
{"text":"First time at Thai Cuisine since the revamp.

When I lived in Friendship a decade ago I frequented Thai Cuisine and never had a bad meal there.  When the wife was craving some Thai food I suggested we try my old stomping grounds especially since I noticed it's been remodeled. 

I realized that the place is half the size of the old set up which makes for a better atmosphere.  Everything is still new and clean.  Dark colors and somewhat dim lighting make for an intimate meal even when the bright sun is shining in through the window overlooking Liberty Avenue.

The service was great, almost too attentive.  We had our waters filled every time we took a sip.  Our meals came quickly, almost too quick, making us think too much prep work is done.  The food was really good though.  We each got a bowl of soup.  The wife got the Tom Yum with Shrimp.  It was hot and sour in a good way.  There were three nice sized shrimp in the broth and tasted fresh.  I got the Tom Kha with shrimp, which was excellent.  The coconut broth was smooth and delicious.  I always enjoy this dish and make sure I try it everywhere.  Thai Cuisine balanced this soup very well.  We then shared a massive plate of Pad Thai with veggies and tofu.  The pad thai was good, but not great.  The portion was huge, definitely shareable especially after eating a bowl of soup.  I wasn't impressed however with the amount of veggies in the dish or the amount of sauce.  It lacked both and might get to great with a bit more of each.  Also, the veggies seemed wilted and not really fresh.  

So, in short. Thai Cuisine is a good, but not great Thai option in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery food using the Grub Hub app. I had the Spicy Chili Mint Chicken lunch special and the Coconut Thai Ice Cream. Not only was the food delicious, but the delivery was early and my ice cream was perfect! I usually get terrible delivery service in my area, but Thai Cuisine was exceptional! Will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while the staff is always friendly and the food is delicious. There mangolian beef is so good. Love there rice and chow mein"}
{"text":"I never want this place to close. It is a spot that makes my mouth water and my belly rumble. I love to find reasons to go, like I need a better reason than, dang this is good food. I love that the decor has really transformed since the remodel years ago but the food has stayed the same. I honestly love it. It is hard to just pick one thing on the menu that I love because, honestly it is all so freaking good. This trip we came because I had a friend visiting from California and was craving Thai food. Of course this was the spot that we recommended. IT is so close to my house that I come more often than I should. 

Starters:

Thai Spring Rolls (fried): Fried spring rolls stuffed with vegetables, glass noodles. Served with plum sauce. I mean their fried springs rolls are fantastic. I think that they were 2 in the order so if you are looking to feed a group it would be a good idea to pick more from the menu. Filling but I could eat the order of two myself, and I am not that big of a sharer. 

Thai Cuisine Rolls (fresh): Fresh rice paper stuffed with lettuce, basil leaves, and vermicelli noodles. Served with Thai Cuisine special house sauce. These were also good. We added tofu to the rolls. They also come with only two rolls but are a bit bulkier so they are more sustainable for an appetizer.

We asked for these rolls to be cut in half to help us divide them up more evenly with the group. This worked out nicely for all of us. 

Fried tofu (personal favorite/fried): Crispy fried tofu. Served with a peanut sauce. Personal favorite. I love fried tofu and Thai Cuisine does a really good job. Not to crispy and not too much breading. Just the right amount of fried to make you want to come back for more but not worry about the calories. 

Main Dish:

Panang Curry: Broccoli, bell peppers, and basil leaves in a coconut curry sauce. Heck yes. This is what I get all the time. I add extra veggies and chicken to mine to make it a more filling dish. I love the sauce and could drink it if that wasn't super weird or possibly give me a bad belly ache. The veggies are always crisp and tasty. I like that you also get a choice for brown or white rice. I usually like brown but sometimes will mix it up if I am feeling peckish. I would suggest a nice even spice level of 3. I do not like to not be able to enjoy what I am eating so a level 3 is just up my alley.

I love it here. I think that more people should try it out. They are also BYOB so we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine for a glass fee that was really reasonable. They even brought us out a nice bucket of ice to chill the wine in. 

The service and the staff were excellent. The food is top notch. Come here for a nice dinner and great conversation. It really is something else."}
{"text":"My usual try at a Thai restaurant is chicken fried rice and it was good.keep the spice level less than 6 as it was hot at 7."}
{"text":"Love this good when I was pregnant with my daughter I ate almost every day . They are always friendly and have offers and coupons they always offer me and my family"}
{"text":"Food isn't bad. The server was  unfriendly and uninterested.  We asked for Chilli sauce at the beginning of the meal.  He didn't bring it. We reminded him later after the food was brought. He took his own time.  As for the food, it's nothing special.  There are many Thai restaurants in pittsburgh that do better, and with friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers have said, this place is very basic but the service is fast and friendly and the food was amazing. The vegetarian Tom Yum soup was perfect! We ordered the special of the day - a fried trout dish which was incredible. The price was very reasonable too. The six year old in our party (who doesn't like spicy food) loved the fried dumpling which was recommended by our server and one of the house specialties - three flavored chicken. We ordered the banana springroll for desert - also tasty. Don't expect a fancy place but if you want really good and fast thai food, this is the place to go in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"As good as it gets. They know how to make it spicy AND flavorfull!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly really torn on this review, I don't know if I should do 2 or 3 stars, so I'm going to go with 2. 

My husband and I have been craving good Thai food for a while, and we broke down on Saturday and ordered some from Thai Cuisine, after looking at their overall rating. 

We tried to order online, but were told that they didn't deliver to our area.  

I called, and the lady was super nice, stating that they would deliver to us.   
We ordered a Yellow curry, Panag curry, and the 10 piece egg roll appetizer.  

When the driver arrived, he wasn't carrying any change for us to give him less than a $10 tip.  That wasn't happening, so we were forced to give him a smaller tip than we had planned on, had he had change.  

So...the curries looked REALLY greasy when they arrived.  
After stirring them a bit, they were less so, but that was kind of disheartening.  

The curries were also very thin.  Almost watery.  
The yellow curry was really tasty though.  Flavorful, and there was plenty of food in the container.,

The panang, however, was a huge disappointment.  
We ordered the yellow curry at a level 3 spicy, and it was about a 3.  Spicy, but not overwhelming.  (For me...I can't do spicy.  My husband loves it.)
The panang we ordered at a level 4.  It was more like a 7.  Spicy for the sake of spicy.  No flavor.  there was more liquid in the container than beef and veggies.  SUPER disappointing.  Even my husband said it was too spicy.  

And they only sent 2 TINY containers of rice.  And I mean TINY.  When you have that much curry, with THAT much liquid/juice, I'm sorry, but you really need to send at least one big container and one small...not happy about the fact that we have to go buy rice in order to eat our leftovers.  

the egg rolls were ok.  They're the little spring rolls, not actual egg rolls, and they had a bit too much breading/wrapper...bu the veggies inside were crisp,which was nice.  

So, at this point, we aren't super impressed.  
We will probably order from here again, because its close, but we'll definitely have lower expectations."}
{"text":"Elsewhere, I have bemoaned the standardization of Thai food (at least outside of NYC. NYC seems to be in the midst of a love affair with regional Thai cuisine which is exciting). When I heard that this restaurant was called simply Thai Cuisine, I was expecting more bland pad thai, more limp pad see ew. 

What we got, though, well exceeded my expectations. The Viking shrimp was particularly good - a hot pot with glass noodles, prawns, carrots, onions, tons of cilantro, and quite a punch of spice (the waiter asked us how spicy we wanted the food on a scale of 1 to 10. We said 4, and I'm glad we didn't say 5 or 6 because 4 was lip burning).  The ginger root chicken, normally a hot bed of blandness was also surprisingly tasty - tons of fresh bell peppers and celery, and chicken in a delicious salty and sweet black bean sauce.  

Extra points here for a gracious and friendly waitstaff, and for Pittsburgh prices - dinner for two was $27 and we have enough left over for at least one extra meal."}
{"text":"Food it's delicious service it's awesome I have try many items in their Menu but my favorites are papaya salad on a #4 which it's not to spicy  and yellow shrimp curry #6 perfect combination and to drink THAI tea ASK for PAM she it's a great server ;)"}
{"text":"I had to order a dinner for about 15 physicians to be delivered between 5-515p.  While Thai Cuisine is closed between 2:30-5, their service was impeccable.  

I called Thai Cuisine around 11:30 am to figure out if/how they could do our order.  I wanted to see if they could even have our food at 5.  The gentleman I spoke with was awesome.  Let me know that while they didn't deliver, grub hub did.  He also let me know  - they could take our order over the phone so they could start - or I could submit it on grubhub with the 5p delivery request.

I asked which was easier for them as I truly did appreciate all their help.  THe order was placed via grubhub. ( I will tell you the grubhub part of the experience was terrible (delivery driver in the lobby of the hospital saying rude things about other races, phone didn't work and said our delivery was delivered 10 minutes before we received it).  But this isn't a review on grubhub!)

Thai Cuisine beautifully labeled very container so I knew who got what food.  They sent forks, plates, extra sauce and chopsticks.  Everything was perfect. I couldn't have asked for an easier order.  

Every.single.physician raved about their food.  Every drop was eaten.  It was delicious!  Not a single complaint.  I don't have any eating in the restaurant experience, but to go orders are amazing and will certainly happen again!  Thank you Thai Cuisine for being so helpful and accomodating!"}
{"text":"I think Pittsburgh is a little weird. Restaurants and places close at odd times and therefore my friend and I were stranded on Liberty Ave looking for a decent restaurant that was open. We gave up and decided to go for some Thai. It's a very nice place and I was very happy with the fact that our waiter was friendly. I always like polite and friendly servers. I ordered the hot and sour soup which I gobbled up right away. It was delicious and super hot, just how I like it. I ordered one of the Pad Thai's I don't quite recall which one exactly but I thought it was very yummy. I enjoyed the fact that they give you a scale of spiciness from 1-10 to choose from. Usually at restaurants people just ask if you want it mild or spicy, but this gives people a nice range to choose from. My friend got one of the curry dishes they had and it was really good as well. After a night of searching for food, I'm glad I ended up with a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"This thai place was....ok.

I got the mango curry dish. I mean, it was okay? Wasn't anything special though.... he got the basil fried rice...and he sure enjoyed it...

I think I've definitely tried better thai food though. It's your typical restaurant- but..... I wish there was some kick to it, or some.... more originality? It was just okay.....

Service was superb though. The waiter was constantly around to fill out water glasses. A+ for the service, for sure!"}
{"text":"I finally sat down in here to have a meal instead of ordering take out or having it delivered. I went on lunch time. And it was a pretty good special. You must get the egg rolls and soup yourself. The Thai Iced tea was delicious. The lunch portion of Ginger chicken was great and filling. The Ginger wasnt over powering. Kudos on the seasoning being spot on."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai take out! A bit expensive, but the quality is excellent. Both curries we tried were great - panang with beef and green with tofu - I'd recommend both! Like other Thai restaurants, you pick your spice level. At a 6 mine was doable and I could have gone a bit hotter because I like the heat. We also tried the crab Rangoon which was a hit. Since we got take out, we didn't experience sitting down - but the interior is very nice and welcoming. I will return!"}
{"text":"VERY GOOD!!!, I ordered:
Seafood tom yum (Soup)
Green chicken curry (medium)
Papaya salad (medium)
Crispy squid
Tasted great, would definitely recommend this place.

Only thing missing on the order menu is, STICKY RICE.
Can you please put it on the menu."}
{"text":"This is our go to place. The best pad thai I have ever had. Great prices, fast delivery, and excellent menu. This place rocks!!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Huge Portions!
I went alone as I was craving Thai and hubby was not. The service was quick, I didnt have to wait long for my food and, as previously noted, ginormous portions! I served myself twice and still took home a full to-go box! I had the broccili chicken, so good! Oh and great Thai tea!
Cons: The waitress could have been more pleasant and the chicken was not fried, it was just boiled and I could tell."}
{"text":"Food's great don't get me wrong. 

Customer service is a bit awful. 

Ordered an orange chicken lunch special and tasted different, worse. I went to the restaurant and asked why it tasted bad, they said they had a new cook the day i ordered. Now their chef is back. I asked for a replacement lunch special. Declined my request. 

Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"After being deprived of Thai food for 2 years, and before that coming from the land of abundance in NYC and also SE Asia- I know good Thai food, and was excited to start my exploration of the Thai food scene in Pittsburgh (am I way too optimistic?!).

First attempt: Thai Cuisine.  It ain't so terrible.  The chicken pad thai was respectable.  The penang curry didn't quite have the rich peanut and coconut flavor I was craving, but the base curry flavors lingered in the background, which gives me hope.  

Heck for $23 I'm willing to go there again.  Sad that they don't have curry puffs, but it's a great location, the people are friendly, and you can get delivery.   

I'm still on my quest, but this certainly is a solid option when the craving for Thai hits."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday with the bf and during our meal, I noticed it started to get really crowded, which meant this place is a go to spot for Thai food. The lunch prices here are very affordable and the service was friendly. The fried wonton pieces they gave us before our meal was sort of stale though. Anyway, I got the pad see ew and it was okay, borderline pretty good. It wasn't as flavorful as I hoped it would be compared to the other Thai restaurants I've been to, but again, it was still good, just not memorable. You also get a good amount of food too for the lunch specials. We ended our meal with the mango & sweet rice dessert and it was tasty. The rice was cooked perfectly and the mango was ripe and sweet. Overall the food was good (A-ok), but I sort of feel like I've had more flavorful Thai food at other restaurants. But I can see why people come here for a quick and affordable lunch especially if you are craving Thai food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. Love the spicy basil noodles! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town, for sure.  Screw all those other places, they're inferior and probably cost way more.

The green curry is my favorite thing, but the yellow curry is pretty good.  There are vegetarian options (although I usually go for the meat), and one time they had a salmon tom kha gai soup special, which I wasn't sure was a good idea, but it was actually a terrific idea.

One of the few places I can take any or all of my family or in-laws and be sure that everyone will enjoy themself.

The name kind of lends itself to semi-comedic confusion, though:
\"Where do you want to go for dinner?\"
\"How about Thai Cuisine?\"
\"Thai sounds great.  Where do you want to go?\"
\"Um... Thai Cuisine?\"
(Wash, rinse, repeat...)"}
{"text":"Pretty good and decently priced for a Thai place. I was sick when I went there (the ginger tea helped me quite a bit). The wait staff was very friendly and came over to ask if we needed anything on a regular basis even though it was close to 10pm.

Spicy noodles were great. We also ordered the lychee curry, which I thought was ok, but nothing too spectacular. All in all a good place for decent thai food in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I do think it's the best Thai place in town. The curry is amazing and i love the appetizers. Anything I've ever gotten here is great. The service is also very good and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Brought a large group of students here for a field trip, they were very accommodating for a large group at the last minute. It was an easy location for us down the street from the school at bonanza and nellis.  If you aren't in this location I would not go out of my way to come here, however if you are in the area this is a good, quick and affordable place to grab thai food. 

The interior is nothing special, the typical thai interior with pictures of elephants and Buddha. The staff is very friendly and brought it's free egg rolls,  extra fried bananas for our group and just overall made us feel welcome, and taken care of. 

We  really enjoyed our experience here, some of them had food that was not so impressive,  I had the pad see ew and that was good, but not the best I ever had. In the future I would probably go somewhere else for other thai food but for pad see ew it was fine."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. The red curry, crab fried rice and Pad Thai were very good as was the seafood soup.  Service was awesome!"}
{"text":"DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER.

A hidden gem, this place is phenomenal - best Thai food I've ever had. You need to go here."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. I enjoyed the Spicy Beef Salad, Chili Mint Noodles, and the Tom Kah Gai soup. All were very good. I don't know why there are Chinese items on the menu. We did receive free spring rolls for our table, which was nice. I do wish they had the cold, fresh spring rolls on the menu. The staff was very, very friendly and I ate here three times during a two week business trip!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I am a big fan of \"Thai Me Up\" in the Southside for their Spicy Basil Noodles (not much else unfortunately), but this place is my new favorite!  Super fast service and really great flavors in the Spicy Basil Dish!  I was hesitant to try it since I didn't think that I'd like their twist, adding green peppers and onions, but now they have set the bar!  This is the way the dish should be prepared!  Such a great surprise!  Their pad thai was good too, but I'd recommend the spicy basil dish first and foremost."}
{"text":"Chicken Panang is always hot & fresh! Excellent sauce with great balance of spice & coconut"}
{"text":"Ive been coming to this place over 10 years!!great staff and owner. They have always taken care of me every visit. Cool spot to check out if you're in this part of town. Thai teas, curry, pad thai!! Its all great!! They always give you free egg rolls with every order."}
{"text":"The food is delicious here! And they have some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet. It is definitely one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine changed us. My dining companion and I like to explore a menu, trying a bunch of different things. Yet, we both repeated our original orders (Pumpkin Green Curry for me and Spicy Noodles for him) on the second trip. We always share our meals so we get to try two instead of one. Yet, neither of us let the other have a single bite, or even asked for one. 

With a fun waitstaff, no reservations needed, under $20 per person meals, BYO, and, consistently good food, we will return. Maybe next time we will explore and share... But I wouldn't count on it..."}
{"text":"Thai Cuisine has got to be  one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever been to. Definitely comparable to the quality you'd expect at restaurants in major cities like NYC or Chicago.
The fried Thai spring rolls are so super good and in my top five for appetizers. Stuffed with veggies and glass noodles.
Pad Thai with chicken or beef are amongst my regular orders. But I also love the Thai steak and spicy noodles with beef (level 8).
And the green tea cheesecake, holy heck you guys...amazeballs!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here quite a few times. The prices are very good for the amount of food that they will stuff in each box. The food always tastes great with one time being an exception. The delivery is usually very quick."}
{"text":"To start off, the best things about this place is the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff, and the incredibly affordable lunch special.  However, the food is nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Yum this is one of my favorite Thai places on the east side! It's pretty much the only one. The food is super authentic and they always give you veggie egg rolls with whatever you order! The Pad Thai is fantastic. I suggest the Shrimp or vegetable Pad Thai. They have vegetarian options which I really enjoy! I suggest this place to anyone on the east side who wants real authentic good Thai food from a nice friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and the food here is fantastic! 

There are lots of great Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, but this is definitely one of my favorites. There are not may places that make great pad thai and great red curry, but this place does. 

Service is always good and the food comes out well prepared and quickly. I keep wanting to try something new, but the old standbys are so good that I haven't really veered away from them."}
{"text":"My Thai food world tour took a detour to nowhere for a while... but I'm back on! And what a triumphant return it was!! 

I had wanted to try Thai Cuisine for a while but was held up by their remodel. Since I wasn't in before, I can't compare to the old, but I'm digging the new look! It's fresh and vibrant, with a friendly staff and comfy booths. They're winning with me already...

We were seated quickly, and almost as our butts hit the booth, there was a bowl of fried noodles and sweet n' sour sauce dropped off like lightning! Bonus points! Being totally committed to trying Pad Thai at every Thai place in the Burgh, you know what I ordered. Okay, you really want to know? Pad Thai with shrimp.

So here's the thing. I really liked the Pad Thai noodles and sauce. It was a huge portion that I ate entirely (lay off me, I'm starving!!) and it was very saucy (just the way I like it!). I was not into the shrimp. It tasted fishy. Like suspicious fishy. I couldn't put my finger on it. Was it unfrozen recently? Did it have freezer burn? Was it sitting out too long? I couldn't tell. But the one thing I knew was that it was not fresh. Bummer. It also came with this weird side salad on the plate. It was had a really thick, almost disgustingly so, peanut dressing with a touch of iceberg lettuce. I took a couple bites and gave up. Methinks not!

So mental note, next time don't order the shrimp. But seriously, this was the closest I've had to my favorite Pad Thai in the city, Spice Island in Oakland. I promise you, I'll order something different next time I go back!!"}
{"text":"The place is nice but was not to happy with the pad Thai but beef and broccoli was awesome orange chicken was ok not that great had them  Exchange my pad Thai and they did great customer service was happy with the place not sure if I would go again but try it"}
{"text":"Found this place about a month ago and have ordered delivery four times already. Love the pad see ew and sweet & sour pork."}
{"text":"Great Thai food at a great price! Incredibly friendly service and super fast to get an order out. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the North Las Vegas area!"}
{"text":"This is another one of the great Thai places that Pittsburgh has to offer.  I've been here a few times, and I know I'll keep coming back.  I usually get the Pad Se Ew, and it has a good amount of veggies and chicken.  My favorite here has to be the dessert - Mango Sticky Rice, which very simple, but very tasty (and refreshing in the summer).  I haven't tried the curries, but after reading the other reviews it is next on my list.  The decor is more 'professional' than Spice Island and its generally  quieter, so its easier to chat in a larger group."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off with this tip - I don't recommend the fresh spring rolls. They are, by far, the worst fresh spring rolls I've ever had. No mint. no basil. The tiniest amount of glass noodles. Made with iceberg lettuce? Never have I ever had a spring roll where the base was iceberg lettuce. This was extremely disappointing. 
I ordered the panang curry dish and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor, but not by the tiny dish of rice that accompanied it. The rice to curry ratio was off, big time. Next we ordered the pad thai... I'm still curious as to why the noodles were orange. Bright orange. Despite the color, the dish was fair. 
Unfortunately, I wouldn't come back. I'd go down the street to Thai gourmet where the fresh spring rolls are full of flavor and the pad Thai is not orange."}
{"text":"I feel like I start so many reviews by saying \"this if my fave spot in Pittsburgh\", but I swear on our 6 Super Bowl championships that Thai Cuisine is my absolute favorite place in this city! So much so that I have to limit myself to a weekly trip, cause if I had unlimited money, I'd eat here every day.

Their vegan/veg options are plentiful, and the staff are super-knowledgeable about all the ingredients in their food and how items are prepared. You can rest-assured if you have any sort of dietary restriction or allergy, Thai Cuisine will happily accommodate you. They are also BYOB will a nominal fee. I recommend popping across the street to Caliente to pick-up beer if you forget to plan ahead!

My go-to dish is the Three Flavored Tofu with brown rice. Tofu is not an easy thing to cook, and there is nothing worse than mushy tofu. I can promise that the tofu from Thai Cuisine is fried to a crispy, golden perfection. Even your most carnivorous friends would find this dish delightful.

Never change, Thai Cuisine."}
{"text":"Gross! When we walked in we could sit where ever, so we picked a booth. As we walk over you notice there are tables littered with dishes, cups, food. The floor looks as if it hasn't been swept all day....get to our booth....there are egg rolls and food on the floor below us. The wall, blinds, fake plants were dusty and looked like soda was spilled on the wall. At this time I'm ready to run but the boyfriend insisted the food was soooo good and worth the gross surroundings. Then the waiting game began....wait....wait....wait....oh hello waitress. Order drinks and place our order for food at the same time. She walks off and I'm watching her she obviously became distracted with other duties. We got our drinks when we got our food. It was ok nothing spectacular and I will not be back. Took the BF to a BETTER, CLEANER Thai Spot and now he knows this place is crap."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pad See Ew. This place doesn't measure up to Noodle Head's Pad See Ew. The Pad Ka Prao was also quite bland. The Tom Yum soup leans on the sweeter side. We enjoyed the egg rolls."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! I always end up spending close to $100 with getting so much stuff. There lunch specials are amazing and the Pad-ti is the best!"}
{"text":"The food is good, specially their Seafood Soup. They always give great customer service too."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. This place is still good. They even deliver and the food shows up like it just got done (not soggy). The staff is always courteous and polite!"}
{"text":"With the not-so-recent closing of Sweet Basil still looming in my mind, I have yet to find a new thai food home.  I headed to Thai Cuisine with high hopes and several positive reviews from friends.

The service was good, decor so-so, and prices were great.  In fact, I double-checked the bill because I thought the waitress may have forgotten to add an entree, it was that reasonably priced!  

The food was good, solid thai food.  My mind wasn't blown, nor was I disappointed.  I think all thai restaurants need to unite and decide on a single \"heat scale\" to rule them all.  Some places it's 1-5, some 1-10, and I've even seen a 1-7 thrown in here and there.  The problem is, they are all subjective to the cook.

I ordered a 7 out of 10 and got back something milder than mild buffalo wing hot.  I think I ruined the food a little by adding my own mix of chilis.  My wife loved her curry, and my pad thai wasn't bad.  I'd go back, but the search continues..."}
