{"text":"So-so, not bad but no that great either. The service was friendly and a reasonable speed; I actually really enjoyed the food I had, which included vegetarian fried rice and the gourd soup; however, my Mother ordered chicken rice and received rice that contained shrimp, which she was very upset about as seafood literally makes her ill. We had to wait while they made a new plate of rice, and the replacement was only spiced with curry and according to her it was very bland. The complimentary items were not very good either - their tea was probably the worst tea I have ever tasted in my life, and the salted peanuts and veggie slices left a lot to be desired as well. It could have been a lot worse, it was worth a try but I don't feel we'll be returning here."}
{"text":"Both service and food was great but it was a little too spicy for me! I came with another friend and we ordered mapo tofu, dry pot winkle and beef tongue and tripe. There menu had pretty interesting foods to try as well.  All 3 dishes were too spicy for me but if you can take spicy food then I would recommend to come try!"}
{"text":"Came here because it was one of the only things opened at Peach Tree at about 11:00pm and I have a penchant for spicy foods.   We were quickly seated and I noticed right away that nothing inside has changed since the last restaurant that was here (a pho place).   We ordered clear noodles with chili sauce, peppery chicken, and kung pao chicken with rice.   The waitress dropped off some appetizers right away. Peanuts and potato, which was a nice touch. Our clear noodles came right away and I wasn't expecting them to be cold. I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew. They were thick, cold noodles drenched in a chili sauce that I buy at Chinese grocery stores for $1.50 a bottle. Mouth numbingly spicy. Half way through eating, I noticed a hair in the noodles and set it aside to be cleared off our table. I didn't bother complaining because we already ate most of it. But no one checked on us, either.   Kung pao chicken didn't have the right flavour. It wasn't breaded either. Neither of us were crazy about it. Too many onions and not enough green and yellow peppers. Almost tasted like it was made with ketchup.  The best dish was the peppery chicken. Deep fried chicken pieces served with more chili peppers than you can count. So flavourful and yummy.   Spicy House has a few... interesting dishes. Like duck head, fish head, and beef lung to name a few. It took us a minute to figure out something we actually wanted to eat.   I don't know how long this place will last in a plaza full of so many great restaurants. The one saving grace this place has is that beers are $2.50 a bottle. That's unheard of!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new restaurant at a very old chinese plaza that is famous for food. It replaced what was previously a vietnam restaurant. in fact they had not changed the decor at all in the restaurant. This spicy house i would say i had not much of an expectations, but the food was a pleasant surprise and has been very good and authentic.   We had ordered 3 dishes. the snail is one of the traditional street food, in china and this was done very well. the spicy sauce was really flavourful and good, and not overly spicy. The crispy chilie chicken was very generous in portion price and flavour, it is a really good food. and i have it definitely at the top of food you must try again. It was flavourful and great. the eggplan tdish was a very different spice from what other restaurants do. and it is a unique spice they used that made it very alluring and not too spicy for those who don't like it.   The service was typical chinese restaurant and is nothing to rave about. however the food was very good, of the 3 dishes we ordered. the only criticism one would have is that it is a bit more oily than some people are used to in food. I think a little less oily would beenfit it. but the price and portion and taste has made it a restaurant i'm excited to try again soon, in a bigger group setting.   I would recommend those who love spicy food, to try this restaurant, as it is very good and has a lot of staples that they serve in china."}
{"text":"I visit this place a lot since it is close to where I live and is open fairly late :)  The quality of the dishes is very nice - delicious.  If you are looking for a place that had a combo of Hunan and Sichuan dishes, this is your place.  You can't go wrong with anything here.  I especially like the dry pots (sliced pork and cabbage), veggie dishes (like the spicy yam), and the spicy sour beef or fish dishes.  Mmmmmmm. Check my pics and vids for live action :)"}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend for lunch on Sunday because we were doing grocery shopping nearby and I just suddenly had craving for spicy food~  We ordered stir fried spicy river snail, chilli chicken, and fish sauce eggplant with minced pork. They all tasted great. I loved the spicy river snail best of all. It tasted spicy but a little sweet. There were several kinds of spices used in this dish but they just mixed so well and made the snails tasted perfect! Chilli chicken is a little over breaded and fried, but the taste was right. It was just the style they did it was not really my kind of thing. The eggplant dish was good too.   Overall I really like the taste of this restaurant. It is nice a cheap. I will definitely go back again to try some other food."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service and even worse food. Do yourself a favor and just go across the plaza to the Charcoal Grill Legend. It has good service and delicious food for the same price, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who has taste buds. I been to this place on multiple occasions and gave it a fair chance because I live across the street from this place. Sorry you lost a paying customer and many more if you don't get your food to taste like food."}
{"text":"2.5 Star  Spicy House is just like another Northern Chinese restaurants popping up all over Toronto and GTA. Similar Menu, Similar Layout, Similar Food..   It is great that more new restaurants are opening up but as many are closing now.   Sticky table, Sticky Floors  Spicy food? Just put in more chili oil.   Free appetizers of shredded potato and peanuts were quite good. +0.5  Sadly the rice on my rice dish was cold and hard. The meat though plentiful. At $7.95 was reasonably priced.  Opens till 2 am. Anyone want to share some spicy and oily food, this might be the place."}
{"text":"Walked in to this place with a friend waited a few minutes till someone noticed us; they weren't even busy.  After we got a table took them about 10-12 minutes to approach us.  One server was just on her phone.   Their menu is pretty complicated and doesn't have a full description on what's in the dish.   The servers seemed to be very rude and unprofessional, couldn't understand English well at all.   As for the food I would probably give it a 4 out of 5.  The service was so horrible though that I had to give them a 2 star."}
{"text":"Spicy House is a new addition to Peachtree Mall.  The store front is boring looking; there is a big yellow sign, and that is about it.  However, the interior decoration is nice, clean and brightly lighted.  I don't eat too spicy, so maybe my luck and/or careful entrée selection, the few dishes we ordered were not too spicy.  I thought they were at 1 chilli level.  Everything was boldly flavoured.  I felt thirsty from the salt afterwards.  I liked the Shredded Pork with Bean Sauce the most, as it tasted a mix of sweet and salty.  I liked the vegetable entrée the least.  I think it was a tart too saucy.    Most entrées on menu cost less than $10.  Seafood entrées and hot pots/woks (??) are more expensive (up to $39).  The portion of each dish was generous, given the price.    Services were average.  One waitress kept delivering the orders of another table to us, and she, comically, realized the error at the last minute every time.    In all, we were happy with the dinner.  It was affordable.  The food was homey."}
