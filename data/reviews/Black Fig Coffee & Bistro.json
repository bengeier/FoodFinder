{"text":"Bistro has its own charm. This place can definitely be a part of your 'good day at the Casino'. I  had super-delicious grilled chicken and fresh mozzarella. The chicken slice was perfectly marinated in bit sour-spicy gravy. To top it all they served amazing beer-glazed onion rings as sides. Can bet a wager any day on this!"}
{"text":"I am only giving this a 2 star. That is because is the most reasonable price for a quick bite. Late around the 11:30 PM you would think that this place could actually make a decent hamburger and bun. I saw what appeared to be two cooks/chefs. What I got was below what you get a Denny's down the street. It is what I call the overly cooked hamburger that  you get at a buffet .Very sad and over done.  One piece of sad lettuce and one tomato. The roll wasn't fresh and the french fries were laced with more salt that one could stand. 
With  the amount of money people are loosing in this place at least you could make a real hamburger with fresh bread in the future. 
For my money pass on this one in the future."}
{"text":"This is by far the best food you can get at Talking Stick, unless you're ready to drop over $100 on a meal upstairs. My husband and I got room service & lunch from this place and both times were yummy! My order was wrong when we sat for lunch, but the kind woman who I ordered from immediately set out to have my lunch fixed. Staff met and exceeded my expectations at a busy, casino bistro."}
{"text":"can say anything g about the food because the guy at the counter was so rude he takes so fast I couldn't understand what he said I ask he to repeat his self he rolled his eyes at he and talked even faster so I ate at a different place when I left the Casino"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by on our way out of Phoenix Fashion week.  I ordered a calzone with lots of veggies.  Point off for not offering marinara sauce and the calzone was just ok.  I must say tho that the seasoned fries were tasty!  I just wasn't blown away by anything.  Be careful if you're dining in, it's smack dab in the middle of the casino, so the smoke will getcha!"}
{"text":"They have a vegan option! Thank you! Generous side of fruit bowl. It was delicious. However, expect a long wait here."}
{"text":"I love their chinese chicken salad.  Even though I love burgers, I always try to order this lovely salad.  Here's what's usually in it. 
Good greens (no iceberg or romaine), a sprinkling of rice noodles, tangerine slices, almond slices, two small vegetable spring rolls,  sliced grilled chicken and a sesame ginger dressing (on the side). Last week it was so good that I ate the rest for breakfast when I couldn't finish it for dinner.  It is quite plentiful and yummy.  
Last night I went over to Talking Stick specifically for this salad and dragged hubby with me.   
Last night was not as good as usual.  The greens played a minor part in this particular salad.  Isn't the greens why people get a salad?  There were some greens but a PLOP of rice noodles were on top drowning out the greens.  I don't get a salad for the noodles, I get it for the greens.  The noodles are supposed to be a garnish not the main dish.  Could they be running out of greens and masked it by plopping lots of noodles on top?  Disappointed.  
The two crunchy spring rolls were delicious.  And the sprinkling of almond slices was generous.  But what happened to my lovely pieces of grilled chicken?  Very few pieces of chicken!  I had bragged to hubby that my salad was going to be better than his burger with sweet potato fries but this is a bet I could not win.  His burger and fries were good; my salad not so much.  
I don't know why they ruined it for me.  In retrospect, I should have gone back to the counter and explained what was wrong with my salad.  I will try them one more time and hope that this time they won't ruin it."}
{"text":"We didn't try a lot of things here at the Black Fig Coffee & Bistro.  We ordered a couple of sodas through out our stay at The Talking Stick Resort, some danish,  and hubby ordered a calzone on our first night.  The calzone was good, the crust was crispy and it had a lot of toppings, but it took FOREVER!  The danish was your average grocery store pastry.  The staff was nice and polite."}
{"text":"Wow I love the Ruben with onion rings. I asked for Dijon instead of thousand island dressing. So much better."}
{"text":"Great cafe inside the casino for some late night cravings. Hot dog, nachos, sandwhiches, salads and even some really delicious desserts.

Located next to the bar and some slots, your never really too far from anything."}
{"text":"Im not from around here but i would recommend you don't eat here. I ordered the 1/4 pound burger, fries, and a water for lunch. Ok deal at first for 10 bucks and it came out fast. Now I'm paying the price on my last night here. 

Stomach discomfort if you know what i mean. I felt great until I ate here."}
{"text":"Latte on point.

Onion rings were awesome. 

Machaca burrito was a bland, greasy mess that leaked thru the take out box, out the plastic bag & onto my dress while I waited for our ride out front. Odd mixture, hard to find the beef.

Customer service so so each time. Not bad, but not stellar."}
{"text":"the most tasty onion rings, ever!!"}
{"text":"Trendy little bistro near the poker room in the casino. It is more than your transitional bistro that serves coffee and pastries they have a full menu that is served 24/7. Options from cold sandwiches, appetizers, salads to hot meals. 

I snatched up a few bake goods that were neatly wrapped and fresh tasting. My mother ordered a gourmet hot dog and chips. The service is extremely slow which was a surprise as they had plenty of staff. Not only was it slow they served a gourmet hot dog that was completely plain. My mother had asked for the toppings but they forgot to put them on. They also do not provide friendly service with a smile nor a thank you. I observed all the interactions and every customer was treated as if they were a headache.  I have to say everything cooked to order looked great just not a fan of the service as the staff does not make you feel welcome. Very odd service for a casino."}
{"text":"I was forced to eat at the Black Fig Bistro since the Pink Floyd cover band brought out an army of people to the casino. Every restaurant was filled to capacity with over one hour waits.

So I ordered a chicken burrito with fries. The burrito was flavorless and the fries were decent. I guess I should have ordered something else but \"if you don't eat you meat you can't have any pudding. How can you have any pudding, if you don't eat your meat?\"

{"text":"Since the mother in-law, sister in-law, and grandmother in-law were in town, I took all three and my wife to the Talking Sticks Resort. I really didn't want to go,(bowl games were on). So I ended up by the Keno Area watching the games, noticed Black Fig and ordered their wings, fries, and a soda. First, they give you a lot to eat. I did not finish it, wings were good, sauce wasn't over powering. fries were good and crispy. They have free refills for their sodas! Service were very good, girls were very helpful. Not a bad place to order food, if you just want to hang out , play keno, and watch games!"}
{"text":"The Black Fig Bistro was one of the most bizarre food experiences of my life. 

We arrived starving and scoured the menu before the salmon avocado toast caught both our eyes. The menu clearly stated \"smoked salmon and avocado,\" among other things such as tomato, etc. I LOVE smoked salmon and avocado, so this sound like heaven. Both of us were salivating while we waited. 

What we got couldn't have been further from the menu description. The salmon was not smoked salmon but chunks of baked fish, there was no avocado in sight, and it was drenched in lots of sauces. None of the other ingredients mentioned on the menu were to be found, but the chef seemed to compensate for that with the dozen sauces. When we asked about it, they looked at us as if we were crazy. 

I could go on, but hopefully that's enough."}

Wasn't able to pack lunch for work, so I stopped by and ordered the ham and cheese with gourmet relish on the side, and fries to go, $10, including tax.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-fig-bistro-scottsdale?select=uZkp4Xcw13--hVVsZQA-Kg#uZkp4Xcw13--hVVsZQA-Kg  It was good, but not as crispy on the outside as I'd liked (and I made sure to open the lid to keep the food from sogging up on my way to the table.  The \"gourmet relish,\" something the cook had told me I could try to substitute for the mustard originally in this sandwich, really didn't add much to the dish, so I promptly gave up on it.  The fries were also not as crispy as I'd like.  

If you aren't in the mood for spicy seafood (Ocean Trail), the buffet, or the pricey Orange Sky at the 15th floor, which doesn't open till 5pm everyday, then try your luck (pun intended) at Black Fig Bistro.  Keep in mind that if you dine in, your platters will be HUGE, so you may want to consider sharing amongst friends."}
{"text":"It's 350am and 5 hours after ordering a turkey burger (patty, not fresh) with cheese, My stomach is killing me. We waited 30-45m to get our food. Smokers everywhere, so I walked out smelling like an ashtray. Next time, I'll follow my first mind and go with Red Robin up the street."}
{"text":"Got first time order for orange chicken. It's hard skin and tough to eat. I recommended that if you like to order this menu, make sure you request them to cook it not to dry and don't make it hard skin dough (or at least they know before they send the food).

I talked to the manager, and he was very polite and friendly to replaced my order with a new one that cook softer than previous. One star up for the services. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Slow poor service an the food is a step above mcdonalds. Greasy chicken quasadillas. Cheese is nasty an greasy. Cooks are playing with each other while making food. Over-priced for what you get."}
{"text":"get the daily special!

the sweet and sour chicken easily serves two people for 8 bucks!"}
{"text":"Love the food from this little bistro! There breakfast is delicious and large portions so plan on sharing!"}
{"text":"We were starving and broke after losing our $$$ and decided to use our food credit @ Talking Stick Casino's Black Fig Coffee & Bistro. 

Meatzza pizza ($10.50): sweet Italian sausage, pepperoni,  bacon, salami, red sauce & mozzarella cheese. The pizza was as sad as our day @ the casino. Its taste was comparable to frozen pizza from the supermarket. 

Bottled water is available for $1.25.

We lost both @ the casino floor and the bistro.

The service was not friendly. 

2 stars!!

Black Fig Coffee & Bistro is not yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"For quick, essentially, bar food and deli/coffee shop, IN a hotel/casino, five solid stars. Pricing matched quality, or exceeded expectations. I came here when I stayed at Talking Stick Resort for three days. 

I was especially impressed with the hot dog and sides portions, as well as the frozen caramel coffee drink. I will admit I got the frozen coffee more than enough times. YUM!"}
{"text":"We wanted to eat at Ocean Trail but it was c any busy so instead sat in the outdoor patio of the cigar lounge with friends making our only choice for food the Black Fig. First the service in the cigar lounge was poor waited 1/2 hour to have anyone come to our table to order drinks and had to ask for them to clean our very dirty table. This was a quiet night in comparison to other times we've been there.  We ordered food in the lounge but had to pick it up and was told it would 20-25 minutes. That's okay since we thought was being made fresh. We found out that wasn't necessarily true.  My Meditarrain salad was a little soggy the chicken was cold and very dry and the salad very acidic. My friend got the Chinese chicken salad and although her chicken was warm she felt the dressing was overly sweet. Both came with a slice of very stale bread. My husband said his burger was okay, nothing special and the sweet potato fries must have been sitting under a heat lamp; dry and hard. We haven't been to Talking Stick for about a year and this was definitely disappointing. Hope this was an off night because this used toga great plac to go."}
