{"text":"One of the greatest Hakka places in the GTA and surrounding areas. A real find of good food at great prices. Lunch special $6.20 + tax includes a soup and soda.

Must try the hot garlic fish my absolute favorite! Words cannot describe how delicious this dish is. Pepper Chicken and even the chilli veggie balls are great. 

I now live downtown and have trekked through snowstorms to get here... ITS THAT GOOD. Don't let the decor scare you."}
{"text":"The food is hot&fresh &delicious&they are friendly &they have boba!!!even lunch special comes with a soda!!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch second time this week. Great flavor, Large portions, Low prices. Will be a regular."}
{"text":"We've had a really hard time finding a GOOD Chinese takeout place since we moved to Pineville. While this place isn't exactly around the corner from the house, it's close enough and more importantly hits the mark on everything we were looking for- great house fried rice, good soup, and their entrees are quality. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Usually love ordering from here. However one big problem after ordering vegetable lo mein yesterday! I got food poisoning big time! Woke up at 11:30 pm barfing. Took work off the next day, still vomiting. Can't eat or drink. I don't think I'll eat from here again :("}
{"text":"What a pleasant find. The food was good, not salty or greasy. The portions were huge! We ate the honey chicken twice and then some. It is worth it to get your Chinese take out there."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!! Delicious food!! Lots of food for the cost. Delivery happened fast too. Wow wow wow!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved their chicken Hakka chow mein and the garlic chicken ! Awesome and friendly service !"}
{"text":"Good hakka food here. Chicken pakora, Bombay chicken, garlic chicken are awesome. The owner is very nice and professional. Service is great . I would definitely recommend this place for anyone that enjoy good quality hakka food."}
{"text":"Golden China is great! They always get my order correct and sometimes even give me sweet rolls extra at no charge. The staff is always friendly. And if I call in a order no matter how big it is they always say 10 mins.. Lol...and it's always ready when I get there. I've been eating takeout here for years and have never been disappointed.. The food is always tasty and hot."}
{"text":"We had a Chinese New Year party last night and invited some friends over to celebrate and eat good food. Golden China did not disappoint! I called a day ahead to order the food, requesting that I come pick up the appetizers and that they deliver the main courses about an hour later. They were very accommodating, having the appetizers ready at our agreed upon time, and delivering the rest of the order to our home about an hour later. The food was plentiful, hot, fresh and the bill wasn't too bad (about $100 for 8 people, and we had leftovers!). I would definitely return to this establishment. Nancy and her mom were very nice! The only reason I didn't give the restaurant a 5 star rating is that while the food was great, it was a bit on the ordinary side (which was fine!)...."}
{"text":"I eat here quite frequently. Food is always good. Their black pepper chicken is the best!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place we have been coming here for nine years. The staff is so friendly,attentive, and nice. The egg drop soup is great. The house fried rice is delicious. The orange chicken is yummy. The crab puffs are divine."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the most horrible asian restaurant that i've ever went to. Both managers and employees will argue, gossip, and calls you names. The manager is the worst. She's basically bullies every costumers that come in that restaurant."}
{"text":"The best manchurian sauce for meats and vegetarian option I have tasted.

Just down right good food and unpretentious ambience.

Lunch combo comes with soup and drink."}
{"text":"After getting my son a haircut next door... We stopped in for a quick bite at this new Chinese restaurant.... We ordered 2 dinner combos.... And boy are they huge and good... It came with a drink and vege eggrolls.... All for under $20!!! I am giving it 5 stars because of quick service, big portions and great price... Only gripe would be... Not enough beef in the beef and broccoli and the orange chicken, although very good and meatier then others that I have had, the sauce needs more zip to it... Amazing chicken fried rice and chicken chow mien which came with the dinners.... We will definitely come back!!!! They also deliver up to 3 miles.... Yummy"}
{"text":"Came for lunch ,Good service. Really nice people, 
food taste awesome for its price, also fast.."}
{"text":"So far, for the price, this has been the best place and the menu is much different than your average Chinese restaurant. For example, they have chicken lettuce wraps..."}
{"text":"Well i ordered more than an hour and a half ago and still have not received my food..when i call they just say \"oh he is on his way\"..from where? Pahrump?

Edit..got my food...an hr and a half later..it was gross...the chicken curry was pathetic...hardly any sauce and the sauce that was there was watered down...the crab rangoons were soggy..the wor wonton soup, flavorless....and even though i asked for chopsticks 3 times on the phone they still forgot them...would not recommend"}
{"text":"The cashier English was limited and nasty attitude.
Wouldn't split my payment between debit card and cash because only $4 was going on debit card. Act like it was a real inconvenience to give me two extra packets of soy sauce. I've had better fried rice. will not go back"}
{"text":"This place is the greatest frugal gem in the city. Pretty dang good breaded and grilled chicken options. Two entree combo under $6, heck yes. The people are incredibly friendly as well."}
{"text":"Food is great!  Owners are super nice!  Service is on par!  Highly recommend this joint.  Go to dish is szechuan chicken!!"}
{"text":"Went to Golden China with my coworkers for the lunch special.  The waitress forgot to bring my soup so it was served at the same time as my meal.  Food was hot but had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  The waitress sat down to eat so it took us a while to get our checks (so keep that in mind if you need to get back to work quickly).  I didn't say anything but it turns out my coworkers thought that the food was tasteless as well.  There are literally hundreds of places to eat in this town that are better than Golden China.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Chinese food at its (Best) for take outs and deliveries. Authentic and fast. For to go food."}
{"text":"We tried this place only because it had a coupon and what a mistake.  Spring rolls were so greasy the wrapper was soaked within the 5 mins it took to drive home.  Then blotting with paper towel soaked up another full towel full of grease.  Dipping sauce was gelatinous. Orange chicken was tough and breading soggy.  Took loads of antacid to get over this meal.  On the plus side the counter girl was sweet when she rejected the coupon because small print said dine in only and only within certain time frames.  Really!  Not the best way to garner new business for your \"grand opening celebration\".  Coupon flier said Grand Opening Celebration but it appeared to be the same storefront operation that has always been there next to Domino's. Teriyaki beef was nicely flavored but consistency a little slimy"}
{"text":"OK experience.  Soups are not great. We tried hot and sour, it was not great at all.  Bombay chicken was good and Hakka chow mein was good also. Service was fast too."}
{"text":"Very pleased with Goldan China. I ordered off of Grub hub and Goldan China was the nearest chinese restaurant to my house. After the first delivery, we ordered their take-out 3 times again after that within a couple months. And we were pleasantly surprised to recieve our most recent order, no more than 30 minutes later. The food is awesome, I LOVE their fried rice."}
{"text":"I love this place I really do, but I had to drop my 5 star rating down to a 4. I stopped by late tonight, I know I should have come earlier but I got off work and wanted to grab some rice here to go with some food I have at home. I arrive to Golden China at 9:40 pm. They close at 10:00 pm supposedly. I walk up to the door and it's locked. At 9:40. If you're going to be \"open until 10\" then stay true to your word. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"No ice. The egg drop soup was flavorless. The waitress barely serviced us and made us feel rushed. The overall food and service was NOT that great. Do not bother stopping by if you're looking to enjoy a nice, savory dinner."}
{"text":"Yummm!!! Have been coming here for a long time and have never been disappointed. Delicious fresh food with large portions...yes yes and yesss!!!"}
{"text":"Hard to find good Chinese food, especially if around this area by Westview HS. Came in on a recommendation, first thing I noticed it was clean, smelled clean too. Like bleach and pine sol, so for me that was a plus, came in for their lunch menu, cheap! I had the sweet and sour pork, came with fried rice, egg roll and wantons. Also got beef broccoli combo for the gf. Meat was meat and not fat. Fried rice wasn't the greatest but hardly gave any so for me it wasn't a biggie."}
{"text":"Best chicken vegetable bowl of all the places I've tried also great friendly service."}
{"text":"Do not ever eat here! I don't think it's real chicken.. Some kind of pressed spongy meats and food that taste like old dish water"}
{"text":"I can't even review this place because they said that they couldn't delivery to my apartment because it's \"too far\". 

Apparently they have a 5 mile limit and when I mentioned it was listed on Google Maps (which I think is pretty reliable) as 4.5 the guy on the phone 'corrected' me saying it was 4.8. So I told him, \"That's still not 5.\" I got a \"I'm sorry.\" 

Well, I'm sure you are because now I'm ordering from another restaurant because you were too lazy to drive 4.5*** miles because of your '5 mile limit'."}
{"text":"Tried Golden China yesterday based on the reviews here on Yelp. Ordered for dine-in up front and chose Mongolian Beef. The food came out quickly, and it was good food and plentiful, but not quite as savory or flavorful as I've had at other restaurants. The kitchen was busy and the restaurant was full of workers taking their lunch hour. 

The dining area was clean, but also very sparse. Dine-in orders are served with a small plastic fork and there are packets of duck sauce and spicy mustard on the tables, as well as a small bottle of soy sauce.

The only concern I had was the kitchen. It's an open kitchen and they have a ServSafe certificate hanging up, but I couldn't locate the sanitation rating, and being as its in SC, they're pretty generic about their scores anyway. 

I witnessed the two women running the phones and cash register also handling raw chicken and eggrolls without any gloves. They were dumping these items into the fryer as fast as they could, so my concern wasn't so much about the food being contaminated by their hands that had touched the cash register, phones, etc. as I was about my credit card being handled by someone who had just handled food bare-handed. I've seen worse in some restaurants, but it was still concerning to witness it right in front of me in an open kitchen."}
{"text":"I ordered the orange chicken lunch special today. Literally nothing was good about it the orange chicken tasted like rubber the noddles has no flavor and my rice was undercooked never ordering from here again I suggest you guys do the same it's was horrible. If I can give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and they put chicken in my fried rice..Twice! They just don't get it . Will not return anytime soon"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and I've never been disappointed! Portions are HUGE (enough for me to eat at least two meals from), and prices are super affordable! My boyfriend and I can each get an entree and share an appetizer for about $22. Not only that, but they're kind enough to throw in some kind of dessert for free with our order. I'd recommend this place to anyone. It's my go-to take out place!"}
{"text":"They left their menu on my door 2 months and I finally caved....and broke down and ordered DELIVERY....I REGRET every dollar! 
It was the worst! $35.00 I spent on a meal in a long time, and I did used their  $5.00 off coupon they provided (if you spend over $35, my bill came to $38, I included a small tip)

I ordered combination fried rice and it was tasteless, greasy and very blah....not good

I ordered lemon chicken and the \"chicken\" was too thin and over fried, I immediately noticed an odd taste to the \"chicken\" so I didn't finish it

The Curry Beef was ok for Chinese curry I guess, I wouldn't order it ever again though, if you like Thai Curry, this is nothing like it!

And lastly, the Mu Shu Shrimp, I still haven't decided if it was ok or not, one bite I would be ok, then the next I'd want to spit it out! 

I will never order their food again......"}
{"text":"The first thing i notice was the smell. It wasn't very pleasant. I ordered the chicken lettuce wrap. WHERE'S THE CHICKEN?!?! It was mostly big chunks and small chunks  of water chestnuts. I will not be coming back here. Service was non existent.Panda Express would've been a better choice."}
{"text":"not the best chinese takeout place i've been to. it's good for wanting cheap and quick dinner or lunch but the quality isn't the best"}
{"text":"Golden China was fine. Nothing was wrong with the food, but nothing stood out either. I have certainly eaten worse, but then I've eaten better.  Without a doubt, I much prefer Peking Toyko in Tega Cay.  

I went in for carry out on an extremely busy Friday night and waited close to 30 mins. But, the staff was working extremely hard, no one was loafing for sure, they were just slammed, so I'm not including wait time in my review."}
{"text":"This was my 1st ever trip to a Golden China.   The best thing about our trip here was the service, and speed.  The female order taker was very sweet,  and our order was ready super fast!

We ordered pork chow mein,  and the combination fried rice.  I wish I could say great things about the food.  It just wasn't great.  It's was hot, and prepared fresh, but there weren't any flavors that stood out.  It was just whatever .  (Apologies for the vauge description)

I wish the best of luck to this establishment,  but I will not return anytime soon.  There is so many options now in Vegas.  As a Chinese food establishment you must stand out....in a good way."}
{"text":"Disappointed- I ordered eggplant and tofu, was clearly old. The eggplant was straight mush, and the tofu was so dry and chewy as if it was fried two weeks ago and reheated. Even my steamed rice was dry with hard old chunks in it. How does a Chinese restaurant screw up steamed rice? 
Unfortunately I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"The best every time....................
I order delivery every week and still no complaints just loving this Chinese food OMFG...."}
{"text":"I have been going to this specific Golden China for almost 10 years. Lee is absolutely incredible at service and the cooks are always on point. She takes fast food to a new level with socializing. She creates customer relationships which is huge to me. When on the phone she knows who I am and knows mine and my family's orders. If I call for me alone she always asks if my mom, dad, sister, or cousin (the usuals) would like anything as well. She constantly asks how everyone is doing and remembers what we last talked about. I love that. I have never had an issue. They are great so I know they get backed up sometimes but I am happily patient, it is never an issue to wait a little. And their food is very good! I usually get either the vegetable lo mein or vegetable fried rice with no eggs and a spring roll... Yum."}
{"text":"I have been looking for yummy Chinese food ever since I moved to Las Vegas...not looking any more!! They are fast, fresh and affordable!!
Their War Won Ton Soup is AMAZING and cheap!! Their boba slushed...YUM!!"}
{"text":"Their chilli chicken is amazing. Too bad their service sucks. What can you expect from a Hakka place? Lunch special prices are good.

Owner does not crack a smile. Not the best place to dine. Decor is below mediocre. Has a lot of flies in the restaurant during the summer. I was bewildered when she tried to hand me the fly swatting instrument (whatever it's called) to swat the fly that was hovering around my table while I was eating. That's bad service in my books!!
Food - 4/5
Service 1/5"}
{"text":"The food was just okay and I ended up with food poisoning, I will not go back! I do NOT reccomend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"This was a best chinese restaurant i went recently i ordered a garlic broccoli. i am vegetarian so i ordered with tofu. it was so good and the garlic sauce was mixed well with the tofu and broccoli. i also included spring roll. Good affordable food in fort mill"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Golden China on Craig  at Rancho I am satisfied with the service and the delicious foods. They give generous portions and it's always steaming hot. I often thank the person who sent me there and I have told many people of the place. What a great value for your money and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Defrosted vegetables that taste like freezer burn, pre-made fried rice. Needless to say will not be returning."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most uninviting restaurants I've been too.  Food was not the best but seeing the price you can't complain too much. The food industry is about customer service as well as quality food. I would never eat again. The whole place made me feel like I wasn't welcome, ironic for this establishment to be a restaurant."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new Chinese place and decided to come here earlier this month and order take out.  We went in and ordered, took about 20 minutes for beef with broccoli, sesame chicken, and egg rolls.  

The amount of food you get for the price is amazing!  We ate off of it for days (eating the proper portion size people) and enjoyed it every day we had it!  

Beef and Broccoli - good, could use a little more beef compared to the broccoli amount, but the broccoli in the sauce was awesome!

Sesame Chicken - good stuff, no complaints.

Egg rolls - typical egg rolls.

They threw in some fried sugar rolls (not sure what they are called?), but they were good too - we had them for breakfast the next day!

Good overall Chinese food, not amazing, just a good go to quick place."}
{"text":"Eh, Jesse and I went in on a whim mid afternoon on the weekend. Place was empty and the decor is lacking. We had good service, never an empty drink. I had strawberry chicken- it was pretty good, not very flavorful but good. Jesse had another spicy chicken dish- OK. Great prices, came out for $17 including a $5 tip. Some people in the restaurant were making lunch meat sandwiches taken from the Pepsi fridge in the front- strange. May order for take out, but not going in again."}
{"text":"I grew up in a community in NY that had many family owned Chinese restaurants. In fact, Chinese food became a very important part of my childhood. 

Moving around the country, I ventured far and near in search of \"authentic\", \"traditional\" and \"generational\" recipes. But to my dismay, I have been unable to find anything close to that NY feel and taste anywhere... until, I discovered Golden China! 

The atmosphere is that of an authentic Chinese restaurant. You walk in and your welcomed by a warm greeter who is part of the kitchen as well as the owner. The kitchen is open to view and of course, you know its the real deal when you can smell the spices, seasonings and oil in the air. Menu is simple, and easy to understand. Prices are very very fair. Ordering in person or over the phone is convenient. The preparations and packing for an average order for us (Egg rolls, House fried rice, Fried chicken wings, Sweet/sour soup, and dessert) which feeds 4, is ready for pickup in about 15-20 minutes. And of course the taste - simply amazing! 

I am in love with this place, and would recommend everyone in the area visiting or living to check it out. Oh I almost forgot, they are from New York!"}
{"text":"Coming from Massachusetts I have a pretty high standard of what Chinese fast food is supposed to taste like. Over the past 20 years I've lived in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina and I have to say that no Chinese restaurant has ever come close to getting all of my favorite foods right. Until now! 

I will visit Golden China again and again! It is my new favorite Chinese restaurant! Customer service was wonderful. I showed up around dinner time with my two grandchildren, under the age of 3, in the rain to pick my food up. Not only did they help me to the car in the rain but took her time to remind me to make sure I had the sauce I needed before leaving the restaurant. I cannot Rave enough about this place! I hope it's not a fluke, one-time deal. I've yet to go back but as of right now, outstanding across the board!"}
{"text":"I love this place! This is my go to for take-out! They are always nice, welcoming, and accommodating. I always get the same thing, and the food is really good. The serving size is always huge...well worth the money. I only wish they delivered! Lucky for me, they are just around the corner. Their spring rolls are to die for! This is hands down the best Chinese food in Fort Mill...even better than Red Bowl! Don't even waste your time with anyone else.

As a side note, hopefully they will offer delivery services soon...or at least work w/ a vendor like Uber Eats or Door Dash to deliver for them."}
{"text":"Great food, and a very sweet and courteous staff. Everything is always fresh and quick. Their honey walnut shrimp is amazing and their chicken fried rice melts in your mouth. We go there often and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"So far this is the ONLY place I found a REAL NY egg roll.  The egg roll is about the size of half of a Roberto's burrito....as it should be to be considered a NY egg roll. I just wish they offered different varieties like back east, such as chicken, pork, & shrimp egg rolls.."}
{"text":"I am still giving them 5 stars even though my order was messed up, they promptly fixed the order and I have no issues.

The service was great and extremely friendly staff, and very personable.  Every regular customer that came in they were greeted and asked specific questions about the customer and their families.  Gave you a real neighborly feeling.  

The prices are affordable and you get a ton of food for that price.  The inside eating area is exceptionally clean.  The food taste so fresh and savory I am new to fort mill but please know I will be taking all my visitors to this place when they come into town."}
{"text":"The food was good I would like to have seen the NY style Chow mein with either pan fried noodles for crispy chow mein noodle like the La Choy they have at the store.  All in all it is a good value and will likely eat it again"}
{"text":"For a local neighborhood Chinese quick takeout and delivery, the food is good, generous portions and consistent. Delivery was fast and food was hot. I am giving 4 stars only on the basis of quick, consistent and decent flavor."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it's a no.. Ordered sweet and sour chicken. Very dry and just not good at allllll. Beef and broccoli. Broccoli was raw and just ehhh. Unimpressed. The noodles are like thick and almost al dente. Gross.  Tooooo bad. I love Chinese food and this is right by by my house. Wah wah wahhhhh.. Pshhhh"}
{"text":"New Chinese spot- they specialize in lunch specials and takeout, but food quality is better than your average mom-and-pop Panda Express. Food is fresh and menu has more options than expected, including boba drinks and spam musubi, but dishes are of the more Americanized style that is all too easy to find elsewhere.

Lunch specials are around $7, dinner specials are $9, but I opted to try the lettuce wraps- available in chicken, shrimp, vegetable, or combination. I found it odd this dish was listed in the \"Chef Specialties\" section, but the $9 chicken portion I received was enough for two meals with several lettuce leaves, more than enough filling, and a giant heap of rice.

Note that though they highlight their takeout and low prices, but food is cooked to order and it can take a bit longer than you might expect. Consider calling ahead if you're in a hurry.

EDIT: This is now my go-to boba stop in Summerlin, because it's always perfectly cooked. The huge NY style eggrolls are awesome and packed with bbq pork and shrimp, two easily make a meal!"}
{"text":"We did not care for the food here although he service was very friendly. The chicken was heavily breaded and deep fried. Not the kind that we really care for and we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife & I tried this out last week and since moving here and trying to find some decent Chinese food, this was pretty good... We had the crab puffs which were fried perfectly and not oily, General Tso Chicken and it was good with lots of sauce and broccoli, house special lo mein which I thought had good flavor and had a great meat/veggie to noodle ratio and the honey walnut shrimp which was our favorite dish and it was realllllly good... Maybe we caught it on the right night or could be that we were first timers but owners were very friendly and accommodating, service was quick and the food was hot and fresh... Will definitely be back but still searching for the perfect place!!"}
{"text":"We have been searching and searching to get Chinese close to NY. We were realizing that we would probably never find one then out of the blue we stopped here and ordered.  We were pleasantly surprised when we tasted our food and it was near perfect. There are small taste points that were a tad different but this is the closest we have come. 
The restaurant was larger then I thought, they have the next space as well. There are tables in there so you can eat in. There are boxes of sauces that are a grab and go. We waited a bit but there were people in front of us waiting as well. I mean, I guess that's a good sign. We ordered so much food we got a free soda. If it's free it's for me. We were also surprised when we were opening the boxes we got a bunch of Chinese donuts... it was like we hit the jackpot. 
This is our new spot!"}
{"text":"This place is everything I look for in Chinese takeout.  Fresh, tasty, reasonably priced and  with portion size options.  I appreciate being able to order small sizes of soups and fried rice.  Lunch specials are great and available everyday.  The food is hot.  The service is friendly.  I'm a fan of the $1 egg rolls!!"}
{"text":"Really solid Hakka!

I had the hot garlic beef and the Singapore chicken fried rice. The beef was tender and the sauce had just the right amount of kick. It was loaded with green onions, which really added something to the meal.

The chicken fried rice was pretty good as well. It wasn't listed as hot, but it still had a bit of a kick to it.

The restaurant itself is in a plaza and is nothing special. It's licensed, which is always a plus. Like most similar places, they have bottles of Heineken and Corona.

The service was friendly.

All in all, this restaurant is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Best food, as Chinese, this is super authentic Chinese food.
Beef are very tender, hey I am talking about the beef steak, they are soft . Most places are tough to chew.
Basically everything is good.
Snow pea shrimp, honey walnut shrimp, garlic beef steak, sweet and sour pork, chicken or beef.
Just stay away king pao dish and fried noodle and fried rice. Always order steam white rice.
You just gotta know what to order here.
Price so cheap and they give you so much , they never cheap out on beef or shrimp. Great quality"}
{"text":"Their food is almost the same compare to China one and China a Gogo. If I rate overall cleanliness, it would be poor. Kitchen workers don't wash their hands before entering the kitchen, food servers don't wash their hands after their lunch and dinner. Also, I found those tables and chairs are sticky. So if I can get the same food at other Chinese restaurant, I'd rather go to China one on rampart since they have real bowls, plates and silverware. The most important, cleanliness."}
{"text":"This place is an average made-for-Americans Chinese place. Not particularly friendly people. The beef curry was barely ok.  The sauce was sort of thickened and glossy. The chow fun noodles were the best thing, wide noodles with beef. The egg rolls were average. I would try a different Chinese place...."}
{"text":"Was ok, nothing to write home about. Food was just meh, egg roll wasn't even good.
At
Atmosphere is not good for a restaurant more takeout"}
{"text":"My go-to for Chinese American food. I typically do delivery but eating in is nice too.
They have the best deep fried tofu i've had and I can only hope to emulate it. Deep fried tofu is great for when you're vegetarian but also want to get really fat.

I've never had a complaint about this place. It's small, quaint, family owned and all that fun stuff. Good, high quality and simple Chinese-American food with no excessive greasiness."}
{"text":"This place was awful. Yes they do have big portion for cheap but the quality was terrible. Pretty much everything was deep fried or drowned in sauce. We put in a big take out order for 7 people and some of the times tasted the same! Their schezchuan dish was sweet as hell. They did not label any of the boxes so we had to guess what everything is ?. No one liked their food and we all agreed we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food --and cleanest bathroom in the world! Well done---Plus the food is delicious and they even deliver.  Nice family establishment with a large menu---"}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering and having my food delivered by this place. 
Let's start with who answered my phone call; she was nice, friendly and answered all my questions.  We placed order from menu I got on link here in Yelp. We ordered pork fried rice, orange beef and crab wontons.  They said food was going to be delivered with a 30-45 minutes. It took them about 20 minutes to delivered by this super nice lady (who my dog almost killed of a heart attack; sorry). Which it was good cause we were starving. 
Fried rice had an awesome flavor and so did the orange beef. Wontons were good but a little skimpy on cream cheese filling. Oder came with free egg rolls (which were also good), soy sauce, sweet and sour sauce, spicy oil and fortune cookies.  In over all we were very pleased with our order and will definitely order again from them."}
{"text":"I received this really nice presentation flyer in the mail from this restaurant and which I'm sure they spent quite a bit of money on marketing. Anyhow, to make a long story short I tried to place an order by calling their restaurant and 1st there were screaming children in the background, and 2nd I gave you my address three times and you still kept asking me for it because you couldn't understand me. If you can't take a phone call in basic dialect which is the basics of your business then don't waste your money sending out flyers and paying mail delivery fees.  0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"During my recent recovery from surgery, this place kept me alive. I would place my order, they knew who I was, and always got my order correct and delivered within 30 minutes. They knew that I was bedridden and I would let them in through the garage via my remote. They went above and beyond to deliver straight to my bed. My favorites are the shrimp appetizer, the wonton soup, the house combination fried rice, and the pad Thai. This place has the best Chinese food, may I recommend it all!"}
{"text":"I am from the same place as these owners are from, Calcutta and I have to admit that in the 5 years I have lived here, there is no Indian Hakka restaurant that comes this close to what this restaurant has to offer in terms of authenticity and taste.

These guys are basically imports from India. There are many restaurants that try to conjure up this type of cuisine, but fail horribly. The problem is that they try to hard but they take little heed of where they are going.

Cutting to the chase... over the few visits I have had shrimp fried rice, seafood soup, chicken pakora, sweet corn soup, chicken chow mein, hot garlic shrimp, chilli chicken, shrimp with mixed vegetables, chicken with vegetables. All were unbelievably perfect. Honestly, as I was jotting down those dishes, I could hear my stomach murmur!!

The flavors were bold and full of taste. There is no such thing as mild here. Everything has so much energy that when you put the food in your mouth, it explodes with such flavor that you have never tasted before (of course, unless you are from Calcutta).. it kind of rejuvenates all of your senses.

The fried rice had the same memorable texture from India, flaky and soft. Its like you are chewing on numerous clouds of goodness in your mouth. The seafood soup was very simple with not too many spices, to let the seafood shine through the dish. The chicken pakora was really basically a spice filled fried delicacy, which was a little mild for my taste. Put some chilli sauce and some chilli vinegar to take it home. I dont remember this dish, but it was some kind of appetizer called Golden China .... chicken? it was the best, much better than the pakora. Shares the same mouth feel but a whole lot more flavor. The sweet corn soup is the only dish which is supposed to enjoyed mild, made with chicken strips and cream of corn. Since I feel that you got a sense that all dishes were excellently catered.... I am not going to keep going about all the other dishes. I can simply close shut eyes and pick one, and there would be a high probability that I would enjoy that dish. This is possible because these guys do not play around when it comes to food, they know their stuff. Hakka cuisine is simple to cook but these guys are truly masters of their art.

The service was not too pleasant. The food came before the plates and bowls! It seems like they are always short on staff. I dont think they even have waiters. They get their kitchen people to do the front end work too. I think if they hire even one waiter, the service could improve trifold.

The service lacks, I can sympathize that cuz this is just a hole in the restaurant hakka joint which serves the best Indian hakka food in North America. You dont come here to be pampered with maitre-d's and waiters, you come here to revisit your favorite Hakka Chinese restaurant in Tangra.

They do not deliver but they give you 10% off when you take out, which is a pretty sweet deal. 

Did I mention that the lunch specials are dirt cheap about 6 or 7 bucks? though it has a limited menu...you get what you pay for.

I would also highly recommend the dinner menu, where you can order most of the stuff which I tried.

Yes,  I am culturally Hakka and lived in India for 16 years."}
{"text":"Stopped here today on my way home. It is in the back of a strip mall and could easily be missed if not looking. The glass front doors could use a nice washing. I assume it has been a while since that has happened from the looks of it. The inside looks to me much cleaner but dated. Wood wainscoting topped with raspberry paint, one or two chandeliers much too small for the space and as usually art work hung too high on the wall. But it all felt good. The woman greeting me did so with a smile. She took my order and in asking; spicy? I said yes.  I ordered the Kung Pao chicken, which came with hot sour soup and eggroll and I assume a crab thingie. The soup was very good with a nice rich deep flavour. The Kung Pao too was quite good although not spicy as expected. But that was fine as the flavour was to my liking while the veggies were nice and fresh.  I also liked the eggroll as it was thin and just the right crispiness. The crab thingie was just sort of there, I don't get those things. This lunch came in at $5:63 total. I will be back. Oh and the woman waiting on me was very attentive without being intrusive. She seemed to really care if I was enjoying the food and I was."}
{"text":"I tried grub hub instead of yelp, the delivery was late, cold, and terrible quality.  When I received the order it was a spilled oiley mess in the bag and COLD.  I was so hungry I ate it anyways.  When I got home tonight to heat up the rest of the saucy rice, I discovered that there was no more shrimp in my Kung Pao order of 13$; so I called the restaurant and since the manager wasn't in, I got screamed at in Chinese, and told to \"too rate for probrems\".  
The quality of the kung pao was all carrots and zucchini, and a lot of Rice, I will NEVER order from them again,  I even tried to talk to them about why the food was so poor quality and was told \"too rate for probrems\" .... try China One (which is my usual go to chinese) or any other these guys don't care, and don't want to hear any \"probrems\".  I'm usually not too picky, but these guys just want your money and the delivery fee.... they don't care about my \"probrems\". SPEND YOUR DELIVERY MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE, THESE GUYS DON'T GIVE A CRAP!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this restaurant on several occasions. 
I have only had their vegetarian options and absolutely love it. My personal favorite is the Manchurian style vegetables with steamed rice. 
They do not have a lot of staff as it is a small place, nonetheless the service is good. I have only dined in 2-3 times as this restaurant is close to home i usually order to go."}
{"text":"Was definitely pleased with our first order and will definitely order again. Let's see 2 seniors and 1 adult (me) ate this one. We ordered the Honey Chicken, Orange flavored beef and then the Subgum Fried Noodles. The egg rolls were nothing to write home about, but were crunchy, fresh and not too greasy.  My favorite was the Honey Chicken - it was crispy with just the right amount of sweet and with the white rice was a perfect combination. The quality of the chicken was high - delicious and seemed to be all white meat. The Orange beef was equally as flavorful, but the quality was \"meh\". A few pieces were a bit chewy (had a tough strand or two), but that does happen with beef. Didn't expect filet mignon at these prices!

The Subgum fried noodles were okay - none of us had tried this dish anywhere before so didn't know what to expect - it was a delicious assortment of meats and the quality of the meats were high. I just thought the sauce (a brown soy based sauce) was a bit bland, mostly just a salty taste, not much spice or flavor otherwise. The noodles were unique. If this dish had more flavor to it, I would order it again and again.

The best part was the \"surprise\" find of these delicious donut like rolls that were in our order for free. They were to DIE for, smack-your-dad-twice yummy. 

I thought for Chinese take-out, it's the best in the area and is definitely my #1 now. Other places around, the food seems to be bland or old and the food here by comparison is miles ahead. The prices absolutely can't be beat! Looking forward to trying some new dishes soon."}
{"text":"Great goto Chinese restaurant. Non-greasy and consistently delicious. Mango slush without boba is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Was n the mood for some Chinese food An came across this place, I got the lunch special it's $6.95 I ordered the spicy garlic chicken it was good an what I liked the most about it was it was fresh an actually an the food wasn't cold. Also ordered the shrimp and broccoli it to was fresh and an hot."}
{"text":"Consistent flavor, large portioned, quick delivery & better than average kung-pao & dumpling offerings. 

Again, consistency is key, although from my taste, not a perfect menu...from egg foo yong sauce thickness to how many Malasadas in your to-go tray sure makes a difference. Highly recommend the Fish Fillet with Black Bean Sauce, Salt & Pepper Shrimp & the Veggie Egg Foo Yong & of course, as previously mentioned, the Malasadas are also a must for that sweet tooth in the end...

Thank you Golden China & I wish you more Happy Customers like me. 

Sheh-sheh!"}
{"text":"Hate to complain but here I am complaining...
1. Order arrived too EARLY.  I wasn't yet ready to answer the door.
2. Special instructions ignored. I asked for a phone call instead of ringing the bell (I have dogs) and sure enough - ding dong!
3. Received food I didn't order, and didn't receive food I did order.
The shrimp was excellent, but the fried rice and chow mein were tasteless.  Sweet and Sour chicken was good, as was wan ton soup.
To sum up: good enough, but Panda Express is better."}
{"text":"The food is cheap, tasty, and the portions are enormous. I personally recommend the chilli chicken and Bombay chicken with fried rice. I have been going here for 2 years now and have never been disappointed. The decor is nothing spectacular, but if you simply want good food then this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great food! It's hard to find good Chinese that's not drenched in oil that makes you sick the next day. This place has delicious food! The fried rice is great and the dinner specials are a great value."}
{"text":"Recommended by friends, and was rather skeptical at first, but figured I'd give it a try since we haven't been able to find a decent Chinese take out restaurant in town.
Pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious, not too greasy, the staff were all very pleasant and the food was ready in a matter of minutes."}
{"text":"This is the only place in town I've found that makes Egg Rolls correctly.  They are thick, full of flavor and not the 'spring rolls' that these restaurants tend to make nowadays.  That being said, the rest of their food pretty much stinks.  Their Kung Pow anything and Mongolian anything is very salty.  The Chow Mein is not saucy, just imagine spaghetti noodles with soy sauce only.  The Singapore noodles are fairly good, but you don't get a good amount for the price.  

This place is worth a trip for the egg rolls though.  When I go, I buy enough for a few days."}
{"text":"I ordered from these guys tonight using BeyondMenu. I've ordered from this restaurant many times before and I've never had an issue. The food has always been good and the service is matched. 

Tonight was completely different though. I ordered the family dinner A and it gave me a list of eight options for my rice or chow mein item. I chose the combination chow mein. I added a couple more items and I put my order through which totaled $35, no problems. 

I received a call from the store about three minutes later. Some young girl, who didn't tell me her name, tells me combination chow mein isn't available as an option for family dinner A. So I ask her if that's not available as an option, why is it listed on the website they use for online ordering (BeyondMenu) as an option? She answers me \"we've never had a problem like this before.\" I told her if it's an option available for me to choose then it is an option available. All I hear is silence then she responds by saying nobody else has had this problem. 

Now I'm pissed because I have a store calling me after I placed a $35 food order and telling me I have a problem. I demand to speak to a manager and this girl tells me they have a manager but they're not in the store right now and they're not available to speak because they're not there. 

So rather than owning their mistake and honoring the items offered on the website they use to place their orders, they lose a good size dinner order and a repeat customer. 

I hope the management from this restaurant reads these reviews and does something about this because it is absolutely ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I never had this place. But my sister said I had to try it. So we ordered delivery. Ordered combination fried rice in Singapore noddles. Said it would be delivered in 45 mins. The order came in like 30 mins. And the food is excellent.  Reminds me of the chins places back in California"}
{"text":"Fail!!! Don't not go here endless you like crappy Chinese food. Huge portions but not tasty at all. I ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch special. Which I asked for white meat chicken which was $1 extra charge.. Nasty and messy the chicken looked weird and uncooked. I will not be back. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Honestly, it wasn't too bad. We ordered potstickers, the shrimp appetizer, and family dinner a (we got orange chicken and beef and broccoli). The beef and broccoli and the shrimp appetizer was the best part. The egg drop soup was good too."}
{"text":"Today we had take out and hubby went to pick it up!  Great as always.... I got the Budda Delight and white rice and added extra spicy.  He got the orange chicken lunch combo. We also ordered egg rolls.  Everything was awesome and all for under $20!"}
{"text":"Delivery was fairly reasonable and th food was good!! I got beef chow main and beef broccoli with fried rice.  Great!!"}
{"text":"Great food and my boys love coming here all the time. Nice family restaurant! Close to home..."}
{"text":"Love Golden China... Granted u just know not to eat the fried rice or the chow mein noodles but the fried shrimp app and most things we have tried have been delicious. We have been five times now and loved it every time!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since this place opened. Normally their very nice however today , the guy was so damn rude . I ordered 2 lunch  specials and 2 chicken egg rolls  , I gave him a tip ( like I always do ) the food comes to the table and I go up and ask for teriyaki sauce and and the guy starts legit yelling at me \"no no no , every time you come here you ask \"to go \" an u never stay !!! . I was like , ummm I'll pay for the sauce , he refused to give me sauce and started yelling more . I was in shock . I told him \" I'm sorry your having a bad day , God bless you . I then walked out . I will NEVER EVER go there again . Rude as can be ... Terrible service ...."}
{"text":"The Bombay chicken is literally the bomb. This dish reminds me of both tandoori chicken, and chilli chicken. Although,  there are no chillies. I also recommend the chicken and shrimp Singapore noodles. They give you a generous amount  chicken and shrimp pieces. Looking forward to trying something new on the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese take out in the area. Found out they are from NY and they know how it's done. Large portions and the price is on point too."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great prices. However the person taking customers orders can barely speak English. I literally Ask for my chicken \"well done\", \"keep it in fryer longer\" ,  \" Extra Crispy\" and because they cannot speak English they made it extra spicy. (the last time)

This place is just annoying. I have been here 10-15 times, and they cooked the chicken right 1 time. The Chef cooks food only 1 way, his way, which is nearly inedible. 

Great prices, yucky food... The noodles that come with the lunch are absolutely repulsive.  

I feel bad writing this but I have tried tipping extra money, begging to cook the food right, gone multiple times and they just wont. 

I sadly will not be back."}
{"text":"Huge staff. Fresh and hot. Bare bones interior, I saw most customers were doing take out. A tad oily but with tofu eggplant you expect it. I can in here on a whim as I was lost in the NW Vegas area and very hungry.  I went away quite happy as place exceeded expectations for a quick Chinese lunch. Pleasant service at counter."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in SC! They cook everything to order and its fresh. But the best part about picking up take out or dining in here is the service. The owner remembers you and your family. She always puts extra little treats in your bag. They are like part of our extended family which brings us back often."}
{"text":"They have a creepy lady that serves. She was way to hands on with the food. I was eating and she reached over me and slid my plate closer as if I was dropping food on the table or something. stood in my personal space for a good minute or two as I was chowing down. It was too weird for my liking. Food was alright"}
{"text":"Golden China is hands down the best Chinese food in the northwest. Try their New York Style egg roll and you'll find yourself rolling right along with the pepper and onion pork and the green ginger beef and onion. Awesome dishes not served elsewhere. Coupons on the take out menu help you save money too. Well done!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The flavors are amazing. Mentioned when I called in that it was my first time there and they gave us free sugar donuts. Very nice and fast service. Reasonable price for all the food you get."}
{"text":"Great food! Whether dine in or take out. Very friendly staff. I recommend the rangoons, haven't had any better!"}
{"text":"Food is alright for decently priced fast food Chinese food.  One star rating for the awful, moody service from a non-English speaking girl that could sorely use some multi-vitamins with B-12."}
{"text":"Great service, with fast delivery! Large portions as well, I am very pleased with this place. Definitely would recommend anyone to order from here."}
{"text":"With no minimum order, this is great for delivery. Not the greatest tasting, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"WOW!! My family and I are from Florida, and we were passing through SC to go hunting in NC. After reading the reviews of nearby places to eat, we chose this place based off the good comments. They exceeded our expectations!! Very friendly staff, tremendous helpings of food, good prices, and very tasteful!! The manager, I assume by her demeanor, even brought doughnuts to our table, on the house, because she overheard us talking about wanting to try them! We go to NC every year, sometimes twice a year, and I can assure you we will be stopping here every time.
Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Good price for good food. I love how i can order from yelp now. I got the orange chicken lunch combo cause with any new Chinese food restaurant i try the basics. It was really good. The chicken was big and not dried out like most places. Got a full stomach and a little bit left over. Im happy. Oh it came with a drink which i love. Go here."}
{"text":"The place had alot of seats, close to home thankfully cause china one is a little further.  Staff was friendly to us and took our order right away. My gf loved the food but I thought mine was just ok. I'd eat there again though"}
{"text":"So we were headed out of Vegas on N Rancho and craving Chinese so I looked on yelp and saw this place.  There was only 1 review but it was favorable so we decided to try.  First of all the address is N Rancho but its really way on the side of the shopping center on W Craig.  We nearly missed it, we actually gave up and was leaving the parking lot when someone in the car looked back and saw the place.  So we turned around and went back.  Nothing to look at from the street and someone in our party was like \"nope\" lets move on.  I said let's just look inside and decide then, I have no problem checking a place out and leaving after looking things over.  Well it was clean inside and they had a good variety of dishes.  The lunch specials caught my eye at only $5.55 including a drink you couldn't beat that.  They serve you in the to-go container at least the lunch specials were. One of us had the Thai noodles which were very tasty and full of shrimp and it was served on a paper plate.  All of us had enough for left overs and ate the rest for lunch the next day.  This place is worth a try.  I would certainly try a few more things on the menu if I was local.  It satisfied our Chinese craving at a very reasonable price. Very friendly staff and fast service.  Not a big fan of the plastic forks and spoons.  I'm used to my Chinese places having real dishes and silverware and then packing your leftovers up.  Perhaps they are a big to-go order location so thats why they do it that way.  But either way the food was good and price was right."}
{"text":"Coming from NJ I finally found the best Chinese food in town ! Everywhere else I've been in charlotte and fortmill SUCKS! Everything I've had on the menu is good ! The staff is friendly and they came from Brooklyn so the Chinese food taste just like home. I don't eat Chinese any where else but here!"}
{"text":"I was looking for Chinese food and I was not familiar with the area.  As usual I went to Yelp for assistance.  I was very disappointed with my choice.  The restaurant did get excellent reviews for the walnut shrimp.  The shrimp was okay, it had a good sauce which helped.  I made a mistake and ordered the fish in black bean sauce.  The fish tasted old and dried up.  It was so bad I could not eat it.  I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for GOOD Chinese food in Vegas, especially on the West side of town. This is the 3rd restaurant I've tried and I have to say that it's by far the BEST. I had the New York egg rolls which were huge and delicious. Tons of filling with fresh vegetables. In my 36 years in Vegas (from Brooklyn) I have to say that the New York egg rolls were the best I have had.

I ordered the Hot and Sour soup. Very tasty. The broth was delicious and had some heat but not overpowering. It also had fresh ingredients that added to the soup but did not overpower it. Again, I highly recommend the soup.

The Orange Chicken and Beef with onions and peppers were fantastic.  Huge portions and great deals for the cost.

The only complaints I have are that the barbecue pork was a little dry and the chicken fried rice had dark meat chicken. I would have preferred white chicken in the rice.

I am so glad to have such a good restaurant in my neighborhood.  I did look over all the reviews before placing my order but was more confused because they're either really bad or really good. So, I would say that Golden China is a delicious restaurant.  I highly recommend that anyone looking for good Chinese food try this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in and figured I'd try them out. I gave this establishment a 1 star due to their lack of service. We waited for almost 20 minutes to be given a glass of water and then longer just to have our order taken. I must say that food was cooked to order and decent. 

I should have listened to the review with a 1 star, lesson learned. I'd rather go to China-A-Go-Go next time."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! I wasn't sure about ordering from here some delivery because other reviews but I'm glad I did. 
I ordered the eggplant and the shrimp with snow peas and both dishes were delicious and a good amount of food. I would definitely order again from this place. The lady that delivered the food was really sweet."}
{"text":"Awesome food and fast service. I would highly recommend most things on their menu.  They will be my first choice if I want to have lunch while passing by the area."}
{"text":"Noticed this almost new restaurant around the corner in Fortmill SC. It had a good rating but from fewer people on Yelp and we decided to visit here. The first thing that appealed to us was the restaurant was super clean! The food was the regular Chinese menu and we got some fried rice and chicken. There may be multiple dishes on the menu but they ended up tasting almost similar. We decided to dine in and don't expect too much of a service - the food comes in paper plates and you got to fetch your own water/soda. The food was hot and fresh with lots of vegetables! It was a relishing good experience! What more could you expect for a  lunch less than 10$. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to grab a delicious Chinese lunch at a budget price in a clean place!"}
{"text":"wow! this is the most amazing place for hakka! if you like spicy food, if you like flavorful seasoned dishes, if you like indian food or chinese food.. you GOTTA eat here!

i've been searching for a nice hakka restaurants in the GTA for a while. So when a co-worker mentioned about her favorite place I made it a priority to visit. oh-my-gawd am i glad i did! here's what i ordered:

1) fish pakora - i alway order this dish in EVERY hakka place, it's always made differently and some places have an issue with freshness of the fish. but not here! the pakoras are spicy, crunchy on the outside, soft and savoury in the inside. they were in fact,  little pieces of heaven!
2) vegetable Manchurian balls - they look like little meatballs that would come with spaghetti, and they are soaked in garlicky sauce. eat them with plain rice - mmmm
3) bombay chicken - (dry), so we didn't know what else to order and the waitress recommended this dish. they're like a mix between tandoori and masala chicken. lots of spices, lots of flavor, 100% satisfactory. i think this comes with a bowl of rice.

we walked away with most of the bombay chicken and some rice for lunch tomorrow... and ofcourse filled tummies and big big HUGE smiles on our faces.

it's a little far from my place, about 30 min drive.. but it was sooo worth it!

now i gotta go thank my co-worker for her recommendation.

five thumbs up! you gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Hakka in years, but gravitated here with fond memories of spicy fried dishes. The restaurant was clean and comfortable to dine in. Service was fast and prices reasonable given large portion size. As for taste, I expected a little more, but still enjoyed every dish.

This is a good spot for fast tasty Hakka."}
{"text":"I love the fact that I live 5 minutes from this restaurant.  Outstanding singapore rice noodles, very tasty chow fun.  Chicken fried rice made to order tastes great and the portions are huge.  I find the quality of the food just as good as it's higher-priced neighbor (Wongs).  Give this place a try if you're in the area.  Also, if you shop at Fry's kiddie-corner from this restaurant, there's usually a coupon on the backside of your grocery receipt."}
{"text":"Golden China is my choice for Americanized Chinese in Fort Mill. Golden China is consistent, a good value, and very friendly. Look past the American guy who occasionally works the front counter. The Asian gal who works the front is always on top of the details. She knows the regular clients' tastes and regular requests - like no onions in fried rice. The dining area might not look like much and it might be served on styrofoam but you can't argue with the value for the money. Most folks get take out. For what it's worth, there's another Chinese place across the street, next to Food Lion, where I refuse to eat unless it's lunch and I have a coupon for a $4 lunch. I happily pay $6 for lunch at Golden China instead!"}
{"text":"Omg .. A FOOD FEAST. Very tasty, huge portions. Only downside not a large place so if it gets too popular, there's going to be a wait because it's that good !!!! My husband who's never had CHINESE Hakka and turned up his nose at first, gave it two thumbs up. Would we return you ask, YES. Good food, good service and great price. Sorry did I not mention what a great price it is as :) Bonus"}
{"text":"At a recent meeting for volunteers at a local shelter, I ran into 2 people who had a similar experience to that of my wife and I.  We all became ill within half a day after having eaten here. In my wife's case, less than an hour. Ours was delivery.  Won ton soup (tasteless), Beef Chow Mein, they forgot the beef.....no, not kidding, and salt and pepper shrimp, which must have been salted three times. Inedible.  When I phoned, and lousy as this was, I was polite, I was told I should have checked the order to make sure the food was alright upon delivery.  Now, you may disagree, but the thought to check to see if beef chow mein had beef in it, did not occur to me. And if there is a way to detect a dish being drenched in salt by looking at it, well, I've not yet mastered that ability.  Obnoxious, nasty, cocky staff.  And for 3 different customers to become ill, well, that says plenty.  They should be put out of business."}
{"text":"You get a lot for your money,  but that doesn't mean anything if you can't eat the food. We ordered chicken lo mein chicken fried rice and orange chicken. The noodles in the lo mein were edible but the chicken not so much. My daughter said the orange chicken was awful, I just took her word for it. And the fried rice wasn't  fresh. Waste of our money overall.  Their chicken taste boiled with no flavor. Good thing I had a coupon! Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Chinese restaurants are to Avondale what pizza joints are to Peoria; they come included with every strip mall, equipped with generic menus, Pepsi fountains and a seemingly randomly assigned embarrassingly stereotypical name. 

Golden China is on the opposite corner of 107th & Indian School as Dragon Garden Express and a block west of Wong's. This explains why I never tried it all these years. I just saw it at superfluous.

It's like putting Ballpark pizza right by Pullano--oh wait.

I usually don't get takeout at night because at Wong's and DGE their dinner entrees come with steamed rice and I can't hang with steamed rice. It's like fried rice without the personality, or Ann Coulter without her Adam's apple.

But dammit I needed some sweet and sour pork or kung pao two. There was no negotiating with my appetite. It was Chinese or the other thing I'm always in the mood for: ramen. And I've been trying to cut down on that. At the rate I'm putting all these preservatives in my body, I will live to be 200. And Law and Order will still be on television.

So I decided to take a chance on Golden China in hopes they could spare me from the wrath of the steamed rice god.

Being too distracted by the superbly cliche interior decorating, I failed to notice the menu posted on the window. So once I got to the counter, I was only able to browse for a few seconds before just randomly selecting whatever sounded good.

I ordered the twice cooked pork. While I sat in one of their two-small-for-me-but-what isn't? chairs, one of their staff brought it out to me and handed me a plastic bag that felt a little heavier than normal. 

When I got home, I found that my standard styrofoam tv takeout tray had come with two small paper bags. 

One contained the fortune cookies and some hot oil.

The other came with a cheese wonton, an eggroll, and a crab puff.

While I was delighted to see all the treats my dinner came with, it left me perplexed.

If the eggroll is right here, then what's in the third compartment of the takeout tray? Oh please don't be two compartments of fried rice.

Be still my beating heart.

My dinner came with fried rice AND NOODLES.

An entree with noodles? Are you sure you aren't Panda Express?

As expected, the pork was amazing. And spicy. Glass of milk spicy. The noodles were soft and slimy, the crab puff was crabtastic, the eggroll was savory and crunchy, not even the bland and unimaginative fried rice could ruin this meal. 

Looking back, I realize that I am really bad at describing flavors. How did I get to be Elite again?

I was so full I thought I would rupture my stomach but I still wanted more.

So I went again for lunch the next day.

I got the sweet and sour pork. It was hot and juicy, with chunks of pineapple mixed in with the vegetables and tender meat. While not nearly as filling as the dinner experience, it served to stave off my endless hunger for cheap Chinese for a few hours.

The takeout is just as good and filling as Wong's dine-in. I can't attest to GC's dining-in experience yet, because every time I've gone there I was the only one in the restaurant, and I have a rule about being at the only occupied table in a restaurant. That happened to me on a date once. It's hard to maintain interesting \"getting to know you\" conversation while some waiter lurks over you practically begging you with their eyes to give them something to do. 

Moral of the story: If the zombie apocalypse occurs and it turns out that brains taste like orange chicken, just leave me behind."}
{"text":"Today we wanted to check out this new little cafe near Smith's, which is not far from home.
The place is very nice inside, and there were other take out orders and people were eating in too. 
We took out two meals plus an appetizer. 
Potstickers were fresh and tasty.
I liked my steamed vegetables and rice which was steaming hot. The snow peas, baby corn, mushrooms, cabbage, carrots and cucumber are very well prepared. I really like that the sauce on the veggies is delicate and rich with garlic. 
The orange chicken was also very good. Rice was plentiful.
We look forward to checking out more items on the menu very soon."}
{"text":"Food is okay. The woman at the counter is your friend until you have a complaint. We usually don't have issues with them. But the two times that we did they were not very helpful. This last time turned me off to this place. They're reactions to things that go wrong are always the customers fault. What happened to the customer is always right. And we weren't asking for the title to the restaurant. They need to learn a thing or two about customer retention. Hate to say this but we won't be going back there!"}
{"text":"I live in this area and eat here all the time...I pick it up because I am literally 2 minutes away. Every time I call the people are incredibly friendly.  I call, I leave my house and arrive to pick up my food in about 5 mins and my food is always ready.  I usually order the cashew chicken because it's the best I've ever had! And the crab rangoon, also delicious! The chow mien and the pot stickers are fantastic as well.  I love this place and will continue to eat here because of the friendly people and the great food."}
{"text":"It's lunch for dinner... I know - keep up with me ok.  They have combo plates BUT I can't combine just anything from their menu.  I wanted the Singapore Curry Noodles with Chinese Eggplant and Tofu.  Those together are not a combo plate; so I had to order them separately.

Alright I understand.  I was just trying to see if they'll work with me.  I said that's what I want and anything I cannot finish, I'll take it home.  Agreed.

Wait was not long.  Food cooked where I can see it being wok'd up.  It was fresh, hot, and smelled super appetizing to my nostrils.  Good flavor!  AND they prepared it in to go containers PLUS gave me a plate and utensils to dine in.  

Singapore curry noodles: has chicken, shrimp, BBQ pork.  I didn't expect this much ingredients but it was delish!
Chinese Eggplant with Tofu: can be ordered spicy.  I chose none since Sriracha was on the table.  Very nice sweetness to it.  Squirt some sriracha and taste buds are having a party!

Very well they heard me out; attentive customer service.  Interior is clean; tables were cleared off not dirty.  Prices are decent.  Seafood and specials are little bit pricier.  But I like this place.  

They serve slushies and boba!  Not a grand selection of, but there was Taro and I'm giving yay points for that!"}
{"text":"As a brand new vegetarian, I was so skeptical but I have been OBSESSED with the eggplant tofu for MONTHS. It is seriously the most delicious vegetarian dish I have had thus far. Its perfectly seasoned, the tofu is perfectly fried, and it just tastes amazing. 

I ordered through yelp with them, about 4 times now and everytime they are so fast and extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This was awful. The only thing that was edible was the crab rangoon, and even that wasn't good. My wonton soup was so bland you would think they dumped the broth out and replaced it with water. I couldn't eat more than 3 spoonfuls before tossing it. The moo goo gai pan had waaaay too much cornstarch, making the sauce a lumpy, gelatinous slime. Fried rice was bland. We have a lot of crappy Chinese on this side of town, and this place is no exception."}
{"text":"this is my-go delivery service that hits the spot each time I wouldnt want to  cook or head out. they literally are outside my house and very convenient."}
{"text":"Disappointed; everything in our order today was over cooked, tough and not even as flavorful as usual. It will be a long time before we order from here again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Since its by the house it's my go to place. Sesame beef is the best. Always nice and since I am now considered a regular they always give me a bit extra."}
{"text":"On a recent trip for tasty chinese food, i ordered the orange beef it was crisp on the outside and nice and tender in the middle a very generous portion, their selection of gourmet food is 4 pages worth and priced very reasonable. Fendi our server alway takes our order with a smile and a suggestion."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese  food I've ever had. Not sure if we even had real chicken or something else but it did not look normal. Prices are ridiculous expensive. Better off anywhere else but here. First and last time for me"}
{"text":"Fresh vegetables, amazing taste, and friendly staff! Cashew chicken, crab rangoons, and egg flower soup are delicious!"}
{"text":"I actually came to Golden China by default as Pho Rose was closed today. 

I got the lunch special, shrimp broccoli, all noodles, no rice. The lunch special includes a regular size fountain drink and egg drop soup. The portions are large and they neither skimped on the shrimp nor the broccoli. The shrimp was tasty.  Because I finished my soup first, I was too full to finish half my order. Really good deal at $6.95. 

Because I wanted egg rolls from Pho Rose, I ordered the NY style egg roll, $1.99 a roll. I was already full from my lunch, that I had to take it to go. The egg roll was larger than the box they gave me so I had to cut it in half to make it fit. 

Again, because the portions were large, I could only eat half of my leftovers for dinner. 

I'm definitely returning to try out some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"I honestly hoped that this Chinese restaurant would get their act together. I have made at least 20 plus orders with them. I would say at least 80% of my orders have been messed up with at least one item either missing or not as it was ordered. I'm so fed up with them messing up orders that I will never again order from them. I think I'll go back to China One from now on. They never messed up orders."}
{"text":"$6.20 lunch special includes pop and soup with your entrees.  It was my first time here, and Markham has quite a handful of Haka restaurants.  Though the decor was very plain, and needed to be redone, the food was actually good.  The chili chicken had a nice extra-garlic flavor to it.  Their Chicken Hakka chow mein is delicious as well.  The food was tasty, not oily, and the portions were definitely worth it.   The service was satisfying, and overall good experience."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy and clean place for Chinese takeout. Ample portions for the price. Amiable and courteous staff and servers. Quick service when I was there, however, there were not too many customers because it was way after lunch time. I had the Hong Kong style fried noodle and it was delicious. We usually order egg drop and hot and sour soups, teriyaki chicken, Mongolian beef, honey walnut prawns, etc. I love their taro boba but their mango is also good. Please note tea is not free and meal is served in styrofoam plates and cups."}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese takeout in NYC (North York County). Prepared with top-notch ingredients, efficient, delicious."}
{"text":"Well, it's been 2 hours since I placed my order. I've called twice and both times whoever I speak to states that our order is on the way.... the restaurant is a 15 minute drive from our house, so I'm not sure how that works. Overall, absolutely terrible experience. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"They decided to try and say their driver knocked on the door and called. they did not knock on mine. he decided to argue with me. decided to cuss and be very unprofessional. I tried to use the Eat24 app. This place is full or unprofessional people especially the male that picks up the phone.this is not the first time. But I assure the last time

I need the manager to message me before this goes bigger than what it is because this guy realm pissed me off 
YOUR EMPLOYEE REFUSED TO LET ME TALK TO THE MANAGER.

I don't understand how business like this give probably fake reviews all over"}
{"text":"The food is pretty standard Chinese fare, but the service has been excellent every time we've been here. It's definitely a mom and pop family run place, which I prefer over a big chain anyway.
If you've never tried them, the Canton noodles are really good. They're like normal Lo Mein noodles, but fried crispy. Then the brown sauce softens them up again. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Golden China isn't the fanciest Chinese restaurant in the West Valley, but they are friendliest.  They're so friendly, the first time my wife and I ate there, we started laughing.  Plus, their food is always hot and delicious.  Their prices are very reasonable, even for dinner.  

My favorite dish is their Sesame Chicken, and my wife and daughter share the Sweet and Sour Chicken with the sauce on the side.  I like the Hot and Sour Soup too.

Also, they have a table where you can leave your business cards and brochures.  I think that's friendly too."}
{"text":"Love this hole in the wall! Very friendly ladies take pride in their work. Very decent food and Great prices!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant!  The food is always delicious, flavorful and the service is terrific.  The portions are also great for the money!  They also have lunch and dinner specials.  Food is made to order, nice and hot.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG !!! they've gotten a golden china on the west side.. Ive eaten at the flamingo location several times, by my mothers house.. But since ive moved up by the west, I haven't had a go to Chinese take out. I def will be stopping in and rating again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious spicy hakka food!  Came in for the lunch special, 6.20 for a pop, a spice veggie soup, and a generous plate of food.

Spice is key here!  Coming back again for sure."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled from Chinese food from the northeast but this was awful. I ordered egg rolls and what I received were spring rolls. The orange chicken was made from tough dark meat and about half of it was inedible. The ginger beef had a bizarre sulfur taste to it. They claim to not use MSG but the use of my epi pen tonight states otherwise. Don't waste your time. Panda Express has better food than this."}
{"text":"This place is really clean the people here are very nice and the food is delicious

I don't think they're very expensive we spent about 25 bucks and ate like kings"}
{"text":"Not good service at all. Asked for a thick noodle dish and the server gave us very thin noodles and didn't even try to replace the dish. The chicken and shrimp was on top of the noodles and I'm pretty sure it was maggies noodles. Not a good experience and I'm sure to only go to lucky Lin's."}
{"text":"I keep ordering from this neighborhood restaurant. Their food is delicious and the staff is friendly! From my experience,there isn't a lot of places in town that serve bbq pork fried rice the way this place does."}
{"text":"My first visit here was horrible. I ordered two chicken chow me in and chicken fried rice to go. The young lady checking me in could hardly understand  me I had to point to what I wanted to order which is fine. But I also tipped them for a to go order thinking I'd get good service. I was wrong. The girl handed me my order in such a hurry and said \"everything in bag\". There was no soy sauce or any utensils. When I asked where they were she just pointed like I was an idiot. I said this is my first visit here. She just turned and walked away but was gladly helping another man that walked in behind me. When I got my order home. The chicken is super soggy and it has no flavor or veggies only one slice of carrot. The fried rice is over cooked and dry and the egg rolls are by far the WORST  I have ever had! I've never had a crispy on the outside and soggy on the inside eggroll. It wasn't even edible I had to throw it away. So thank you golden china for being close to home I will gladly NOT give you my business or any referrals I will take my business back to new York china on lake mead and rampart. At least I get decent service and good food for a better price. I don't know why I bothered to even try something new, it was a waste of time and my hard earned money. I DON'T  recommend this place at ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place deserves a 0 star!"}
{"text":"This china food restaurant opened recently near to my office. Actually, I live on the other side of the tow, but this is just close to my office. And I decided to check out what they are doing and what kind of food are cooking.

First step inside. The smell. It smells on food and vegetables but the smell is not so strong. In some places is so strong that stays as a perfume with your clothes. 

The place is not so big inside, however there is a lot of room for big groups. As you might guess the noise level is average to loud.

Fast. The guys from the staff are working very fast and seems they are concentrated in their work. Cashiers are working fast too. I mean the speed of the line is really good. I needed 4 - 5 minutes from choosing the order to the first bite.

Quality of food. Good the food is just good - fresh hot and tasty. But everyone has it own taste, so I am just evaluating the quality and the freshness. 5 stars for the food.

As a typical chines restaurant, the variety of dishes is great. Almost no matter what you chose, a decent meal will cost you between 6 and  9 dollars. Two portions are more than enough for 3 persons. Take off is allowed too."}
{"text":"This is the worst place, styrofoam , bowls, plastic everything and food is so bad. They somehow got my past review removed, be careful at this place!"}
{"text":"Really worth trying, great lunch specials!!! 6.50, many options to choose from, tasty food, many options not deep fried, and all very flavorful."}
{"text":"I had the dinner combo. I had it with orange chicken and fried rice. It came with an egg roll and a medium size fountain drink. It was just normal Chinese food."}
{"text":"I'm so desperate to find a decent , fairly priced Chinese place but the quality just isn't here. The chicken feels slimy and everything I ordered seemed to have the same flavor . Keep trying ... Sorry"}
{"text":"My family and I just moved into the area and decided to give this place a try tonight. I just had the worst Chinese food of my life here. I typically like Chinese food, but never again from this place! What made matters worse was the waitress appeared to be sick with some sort of a cough and she did nothing to prevent spreading it...she just coughed at will. I'll be praying for my immune and digestive system tonight!"}
{"text":"So I was hungry went on grubhub and stumbled on this place paid $20 for 3 entrees shrimp fried rice, orange chicken & beef and broccoli.  The orange chicken was ehhh maybe 3/10 but my daughter loved it ! Way to sweet and little hard. But the other two were pretty tasty not the best chiness food I've ever tasted but hit the spot for a really cheap price. From order to delivery was about 35 minutes they came fast! A huge plus for some starving people and the guy was nice that brought the food and was literally so hot like it was from the kitchen at that second. I did like the chow mein and fried rice alot. All in all if I need fast, hot and cheap meal which is very decent taste wise I'll definitely be ordering here again."}
{"text":"So I don't know if this is a new management or what but this place's customer service has gone downhill FAST! This is my 3rd trip to giving them a chance and I am finally very irritated. I eat in at all times, they also eat in the dining area along with the customers. Now, I don't mind them having lunch but they completely stopped servicing their customers too. How weird is it that I had to go to their table and apologize for interrupting their meal to ask for a to-go bag. Lol wow! Today, we walk in and sit down, this kid calls out to us and says \"you come here and order first\"... before this visit, we were greeted, menu and utensils were brought to our table and order was taken from our table. Wth. Smh. Food is always delicious... no complains there. Chef is awesome, only reason why we came back."}
{"text":"This is not a first-date-restaurant.  However, it has everything I want in a Chinese restaurant that will keep me as a regular customer.  Food is very well priced for expedient service and quality food.  Simple, authentic, and cheap."}
{"text":"Always hot, always good and always delivered super fast. No mistakes on orders and portions are large!"}
{"text":"Food is real good. They cook their wings when you order so it's not sitting there allday. I took my daughter and she had the General TSO's chicken and as picky as she is, she liked it."}
{"text":"One of the many Hakka places you can get a decent lunch special at. 

It's a small looking place and very dated especially in the plaza surrounded by nearly everything else if you're feeling a food craving. There's lots of other Hakka places and chinese/Indian places like Hakka king across the street. 

There are lunch specials for between $5 to $8 wit your standard Indian spiced Manchurian stuff and Bombay chow Mein. Ended getting both and wasn't too disappointed. Would've preferred the crispy chow Mein noodles but that's fine. Lots of meat to go with the meal and that spicy but not completely overpowering flavour. Also not too too greasy but don't expect to make healthy choices coming here for lunch. 

They have dinner take out as well but my advice is go somewhere else that does a better dinner selection. Nothing against this and but really is a greasy spoon for lunch if you want that spicy flavour."}
{"text":"I swear this is the only place in town that does a true NY egg roll. Delicious walnut shrimp. Pretty good twice cooked chicken. Also love their Szechuan beef.  Have liked everything that we've tried here"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese takeout in Regent Park. They have huge portions for the price and don't use MSG."}
{"text":"Placed an order on the phone and they told is to pick up in 25 minutes. We went to the restaurant and the food was not ready as promised. We were told to come back in another 15 minutes to pick up. We went back to be told that the food will take another 15 minutes. I would not go near this place again for take out as they cannot deliver on their promise.

One of the worst experience I've had with any restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Best Orange Chicken in town and great delivery rates. 

I order from this location once to twice a month and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter went to eat at this restaurant. The lady taking our order seemed irritated to begin with.  we had ordered and gotten our food. A short while two guys came in. One of the guys was older, in a wheelchair with one leg. as he was eating he began to choke. NONE OF THE STAFF CAME TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEY LOOKED FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER AND CONTINUED COMPLETING ORDERS... after the son and I performed the heimlich on the man , he threw up some he then went outside to get some air at that time one of the employees (a guy) asked if everything was ok? I said yes!!! Now it is the guy was choking and threw up on the mat. He frowns and rolls his eyes . The nasty thing was he used the broom to sweep up the mat where the vomit was... I work in healthcare and that is nasty. I will not eat here again. ... the had no sympathy at all"}
{"text":"i have ate here several times. the food is good and not to pricey. the best chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"I never thought I would see the day that I would be disappointed with Golden China or, more specifically, chicken chow fun. Tonight was when the grand illusion came crashing down.

I love chicken chow fun. Its one of my favorite dishes, period. I ordered it again tonight with my heart and my stomach set on those delicious chewy noodles. My first bite I knew something was amiss. I kept chewing the chicken and it did not break down. I spit out that piece and tried another thinking I just got a gristly piece the first time. Nope. The next piece was even worse. I tried to break apart a third piece with my hand and that help firm. I don't know what they did to this poor chicken but it was very cruel. I ended up seeking and removing all the chicken from my chow fun and ate the noodles only. They were actually quite good. I've got to give them that.

I also ordered another favorite treat tonight, Spam musubi. I was less than pleased with this too. There was far too much rice. So much I could hardly bite into it. The Spam was good as was the nori and sauce. But the rice in all its bulk was not great. There was a strange minerally or rancid taste. I removed the excess and ate just the Spam and nori. 

I hope I just caught Golden China on an off night. I've been eating here for about four years and I've always liked it. I want to continue liking it. I'm not so sure about that right now."}
{"text":"Delicious orange chicken, teriyaki beef, rice and veggies. Totally fresh, hot and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst hot sour soup greasy, chow main over sauced and cheep noodles pork fried rice horrible! 
I can't believe they got these ratings from other ppl."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food not too busy wonderful stuff very informative and friendly place is clean you can watch everything that's going on in the kitchen and they have a great variety I will be returning to Golden China"}
{"text":"They're lunch special is very cheap. Similarly, their food quality is very cheap. Golden China keeps your wallet fat, but  makes your stomach fatter."}
{"text":"Ordered some take out. Had the family dinner for two with sweet and sour chicken, beef broccoli, wonton soup, egg roll and rice. And a lo mein lunch special on the side. Was more than enough food to feed more than 2 people. Never been inside the restaurant just read some reviews and decided to order from here. Chinese food was average nothing special but definitely not bad and would order from here again."}
{"text":"The cashier was nice and the service was fast, however my food doesn't really taste like anything and I can tell it's not fresh."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way home from the beach. Service was fast and food was good at a really reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is my go to for delicious and affordable delivery, I've never been disappointed! The shrimp chow mein is my favorite."}
{"text":"All time favorite place for Chinese food. So glad i found a place close to home. The staff is always very friendly and the food is always hot, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great prices, super fast service!  Steamed dumplings, mei fun, and crab rangoon are our favorites."}
{"text":"I've had better Chinese food. The cheese puffs  didn't have much cream cheese. The orange chicken was pretty much only breading. 

I was pretty disappointed. I did like their sweet and sour soup, it was pretty spicy, but otherwise I do not see myself coming back. 

There was a lot of people coming in for take out, so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my son.  Great General Tsos and Garlic Chicken - and quite a bit of both.  Is great that they serve the Lunch Menu 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around. Service is fast and consistent, and the portions are large. Inexpensive as well. 10/10"}
{"text":"Everything is so good. I eat the curry noodles (picture below),  egg drop and won ton soup also try the lunch special.  They do a GREAT job. 
Try it! Then stop by Kmart and go shopping lol."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery. With great and friendly staff. Love the Canton noodles and hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"The food is always good! You cant beat the price for the combo's. They come with a small soup, a spring roll, a fried wonton and a fried shrimp! Also, the churchy goodies for the soup. It's the little things that count"}
{"text":"Met up with friends at this place today and I must say, the food was quite delicious.  It is located in a small shopping center between Albertsons and a footwear store.  Parking was great, a lot of parking actually.  The place was pretty small, maybe about 8 booths and 4 tables.  The waitress was not very friendly, almost seemed rushed and they weren't even busy at all.  One of my friends the Tsing Tao dinner plate, the other ordered the beef broccoli and my daughter and I shared the shrimp fried rice, salt and pepper shrimp and salt and pepper chicken.  It was really good.  The spices kicked the dishes up a notch.  The fried rice was really flavorful.  Our order came out fast, we didn't have to wait long, the food looked fresh. Overall, I would come back here to eat again."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place -5 stars I would. The food is overly greasy and microwaved. Bland rice and noodles and add drop soup. All the chicken is excessively breaded. As the daughter of a professional chef of over 37 years, I have the credit to diss this place. Not only was the food terrible, so was the customer service. It's no wonder it was empty. Maybe the cashier was just racist. The vegetables were uncooked so when we asked for them to cook it she said \"you should have tell me before. You have to ask\". 

Why should we have to ask when they should have already been cooked??? If anything she should have asked  us! We've never been here before, how would we know?

Then they took the plate and threw it in the Wok  , didnt really cook it and tossed it back in our to go container -- making a mess. Then we tried it and it was even more greasy and still not cooked. We tried to return and ask for something else and she got an attitude yelling at us saying we have to ask for cooked food and then insulting us in Cantonese to her coworkers. We said forget the food give us our money back then she yelled at us some more \"oh you want Money back? Why you don't just get other food? Money huh?\" 

She was so unnecessarily rude. To the point it was a small argument. I'm so disappointed in this restaurant. They must have hired people to give them stars because theyre not worth it.


Revolting food and service.
Don't waste your money or your time.
Panda Express is better than this shit."}
{"text":"The mongolian beef lunch special had a lot of veggies...which is a good thing. A bit more grease than I prefer but you get what you pay for. Still, I enjoyed my meal. Fast and hot."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff who genuinely seem to care about their customers. Food is incredible. We have had our food delivered twice and everything was fresh, hot, and correct."}
{"text":"Actually 1/2 star . Waitress was nice only good thing oh wait egg rolls were a 3. Because they looked store bought. Orange chicken seemed a week old and crispy noodle dish had a slime sauce and I honestly couldn't tell difference between chicken and beef they both tasted boiled to death. The hot tea was cold not even lukewarm. There was also a loud heated commotion in the kitchen it made it very uncomfortable especially since it was all in Chinese and you can't understand. Do yourself a favor go to Kung fu on spring valley and valley view. That's our normal place  we receive a flyer in the mail from golden China thought we would try, huge mistake!!!! Plastic silverware and foam plates for dining in!"}
{"text":"Went In for lunch ordered 2 lunch specials Mongolian beef n orange chicken.everything was very good we will be back.!!"}
{"text":"This food was good and hot when i received it..it was also flavored and fragrant.
Just don't like having so much rice and so little noodles. Customer service has always been polite. Steady flow of customers. Eggrolls hot and flaky,which I love."}
{"text":"This food was the best I had in Vegas. The New York style chow mein and egg rolls were right on point. I also had the hot and sour soup which was very good. For the family we ordered Orange chicken, chicken fried rice and kung pao chicken.  Everyone was very happy with their meal. I highly recommend this restaurant especially if you like New York style food. Fast and friendly service. The delivery person was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Pakora!!!  Chicken and shrimp both.  The oven has enough firepower to do noodles justice, but the choices aren't all that interesting.  Still, the pakora redeems this place."}
{"text":"So disappointed . Spent $78 on dinner here.. if you like frozen and then reheated Chinese food or if you think Chinese food from the frozen food aisle at your grocery store is way to good for you and ur desperately searching for something worse than that then congratulations this is your place for sure.  I'm sorry but it was gross. I regret everything. 
Thank you for reading, sorry to ruin your meal plans.. or make them... who knows? it takes all kinds right?"}
{"text":"No one acknowledged me while I was waiting to order. Even after the customer ahead of me was finished. I will take my business elsewhere. There was  also a foul odor lingering in there too, hopefully they took care of that problem.."}
{"text":"Best chilli chicken on the planet! It is worth buying their dinner size chilli chicken, as they are very generous. I've been a customer since 2010 and have always been more than satisfied."}
{"text":"My family always order party trays from here. The food tastes great and the cashier is nice. She may come off as mean at first but she really is sweet. I recommend the beef broccoli, combination fried rice, combination egg foo young, and egg rolls. They have lunch and dinner specials that are cheap and comes with a free drink and soup of your choice."}
{"text":"when will i learn!!! loved their crab egg foo young...........they are just going down hill.  ordered crab rangoon.........BURNT!!!!!!!!!!  wow! i pay almost $1.00 per wonton and you burnt 1/2 of them!  fried rice - no flavor.........going straight down hill.  learned my lesson, NEVER again. too bad, there was a time - many months ago and they were great!  not to mention, rang the doorbell - knocked loudly on door- rang the doorbell again - knocked on door again - all in the same second!!!! wow! NEVER again!"}
{"text":"I had some bad shrimp...very sick for about 24 hours. I knew it the second I bit into it that is was bad. Luckily I did not swallow much of it. The people there are very sweet, but just keep an eye out on the seafood."}
{"text":"I love this place. The fried rice and crab rangoon are sooo good. They make it easy to call ahead to order and pick up later. We did takeout so we didn't stay in the building but there is seating available.

The menu felt overwhelming to me the first time and Im not exactly a Chinese food connoisseur, but I like the variety of the choices. Garlic beef"}
{"text":"I will drive 20 min from where I live just for their Chinese food!  Its so tasty, always hot, and very good portion sizes.  If you want fresh, delicious Chinese food you have to come here!"}
{"text":"This place is my Thai tea with boba spot. It's cheaper then other places, I come here often and  the staff is always so friendly. Wonder if they get tired of seeing me. Lol."}
{"text":"Golden China is one of my favorite places to order lunch. Their delivery driver is quick and polite and the food is always great."}
{"text":"Really decent hot and sour soup and fried rice. Very easy and quick carry out, and inexpensive.  I wouldn't go out of my way to get there but it's ok.  My hub had the pepper steak and onions, it was a really big portion for the $."}
{"text":"My meal was disgusting! I ordered the orange chicken lunch special. The orange chicken tasted old and dry, the sauce was congealed. 
The chow mein noodles were like overcooked, reheated, spaghetti noodles. They were also very bland.
The rice was hard and dry. 

I did not realize by ordering the lunch special, I would have to eat what was left over from yesterday. I'm upset. I like food. I wanted to like this!"}
{"text":"Really good salt and pepper shrimp!!! So bomb! Food came out super quick!  NY Egg roll  didn't care for the chow mein noodles  other than that really good"}
{"text":"Stopped by based on yelp reviews.  Great value for the money. Huge servings in the dinner combos, and the food is pretty tasty.  Sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, and crab rangoon were on point!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, definitely good enough as your no frills, neighborhood Chinese takeout place that's as good as any. The problem usually is the delivery. Takes much longer than expected most of the time, and the delivery person has gotten lost on more than one occasion."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food, friendly and prompt service, it was a little warm in the restaurant so that made it a but uncomfortable, but all in all it was a nice dinner experience, I will definitely be back soon and often."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for good Chinese food. Always large portions and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I got really lucky with this place. 
For the better part of 10 years, my hands had been tied because I had only one Chinese restaurant that delivered to me.
Not that it was bad or anything, but it's always nice to have a choice.
Then, I got a flyer in my door for this place, so I was pretty much guaranteed that they would deliver to me.
The food was very good, and reasonably priced.
My only complaint was that they took over an hour to get the food to me, when I was used to getting it within 15 minutes.
It was Saturday night, and they were very apologetic, but I see from the other reviews, that they are slow in general.
The next time I order from them, I'll just prepare myself for the extra wait time.
Other than that, I was very satisfied, and will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Once a month, I visit local eateries by our house.  This one is always a favorite, because every dish seems to be really fresh and really hot.   For the same money (No really!) as a fast food meal, you get a freshly cooked meal.  The Sesame and Orange chicken is always a favorite, but the spicy beef and broccoli is my personal go-to menu item when I'm not feeling adventurous.  It's lean beef, not fatty, not drowning, not spiced to death - just the way you'd want to eat it with just enough flavor and spice.

The waitress is always ALWAYS friendly, and never overbearing.  She takes your order, refills your tea or Pepsi, and leaves you alone to enjoy your meal.  The restaurant - if I'm not mistaken - is family run.  What a nice group of people with a quaint atmosphere, and not interrupted by televisions.  The price is absolutely right.  

On the rare occasion when I'm sick, I order take-out of the egg-drop or spicy soup.  The soup has a similar effect on me as when Popeye eats a can of spinach.  Suddenly the color returns to my face, my arms bulge out, my tattoos clap together and I go outside and beat up a bad guy, usually some loitering post-pubescent scarpocked punk at the Charter School Academy just two storefronts down.  

It's that good.  Crime fighting good!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge, everything comes hot and fresh when delivered. Great local place. Everything I order is a huge portion that I literally can split with three people. Crab Rangoons are good, rice could use more flavor tho. Fried wontons noodles are always fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying service is great cashier lady in the front was nice and very straight to the point. The workers in kitchen/ back area were always working hard and attending food or other things in the back area. Prices are good for lunch specials that come with a drink. I don't usually like to write bad reviews but I really didn't like the food here at all. I love love Love Asian restaurants and love trying new things but the food here was bland cold and lacked flavor. Ordered orange chicken lunch special came with fried rice, chow mein, soup and a drink. The chicken was tasteless except for saucy and rubbery. The noodles and rice gave off an old microwaved feel. My favorite part of the meal was the soup. Wouldn't come back but enjoyed the service."}
{"text":"The best best best!!!!!
This is a small family owned business that makes wonderful food!!!!
I am a vegan and they are happy to sub anything with tofu or just make me a vegetable chow menu plate. Always friendly, always smiles. 
These people have my business for life with I could give 6 stars"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout tonight for the family. Had high hopes for this place and noticed the takeout boxes were filled to the brim. 

Unfortunately, The flavor and taste were nonexistent.

I ordered orange chicken which tasted burnt, old, and chewy as beef jerky. 

I wonder if the fried rice was heated up from the day before.. 

Honey walnut chicken looked and tasted okay with some extra white rice on the side. 

I'll stick with going to joyful house on spring mountain"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese take out place. It's good. It's close to all of the Regent Park neighborhoods. 

We've never had a problem and the wait is short. I would recommend it to any new neighbors who moved in and asked where to get Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Worst service. They charged me immediately called me for tip even before food arrived this was 1.5 hrs ago! Food still hasn't arrived!!!!"}
{"text":"We came across this place by searching google and I'm glad we did! The food is delicious and the service on the phone to order a pick up order was excellent. We have been back multiple times."}
{"text":"The lunch special is a great value. $5.95-$6.95 you get soup and soda with a huge portion of fried rice with noodles. This will be my regular place for Chinese take out"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and prices are great. Don't miss this.  Crab rangoon and chicken wings are a must.  And the owner lady is a real pistol.  Very funny."}
{"text":"Very good, not amazing or anything, but definitely very good fast Chinese food.  Ordered this for delivery from my hotel room.  They were the only place left open at 10:15 that delivered.  They told me it would be 45 minutes for my food, but I swear it was at my door in under 20...delivered by drones I wonder? 

I had crispy orange shrimp which was pretty good.  The crab ran goons were very good.  

Don't be afraid to try this place.  Prices were great.  Delivery and service seemed awesome."}
{"text":"Not bad take out.  Prices are fair. Food is not bad.  Good attitudes. Looks clean. Good service.  What more can one ask for?  We have ordered here multiple times before and will continue coming here."}
{"text":"We've been there twice the first time was great but this was last year. This past week we ordered take out and the food was not as great while the soup was tasteful. We only ended un nibbling what we ordered. FYI it was Curry Chicken Combo and Kung Pao 2 Combo, lots of food. It was served nicely and with all we needed, but it needed some flavor. Not stating their customer service, they accidentally over charged us. We gave them the benefit of the doubt, but days later they still charged us twice. Not satisfied with their customer service."}
{"text":"i've been eating here for a few years now and never had an issue with my food it's always hot and fresh and has good flavor. they don't speak much english but hey i'm not there for conversation... well i was debating wether or not to leave a review but with what happened it must be put out there. the day finally came after we ordered with my wife we went to sit down and they have an open kitchen layout and she sees the cook sneeze wipes his snot nose with his bare hands and then reaches into the vegetables throws them in the stir fry pan to cook never even had the thought to wash his hands. thankfully she was able to witness this before we got our food with \"extras\"we told the lady which is to believe she is the owner and she did say something to the cook about what happened and seemed to be upset about it. unfortunately i won't be returning anytime soon and hope that they implement some stricter sanitary rules. if you decide to give it go..... BEWARE"}
{"text":"Everything that I ordered was bland. Nothing was crispy and it was drown in a generic sauces that all tasted the same. I would not come again."}
{"text":"We placed order the other night. Picked up and our chicken fried rice looked different. Like not cooked and weird texture. Called and explained to manager Jen said bring it back. They cook the chicken different. 
The only thing was it was late and mentioned the drive was far. She said only tonight we can fix. I said ok well I won't be back ever. Lemon chicken was ok the put the sauce on the side. The beef lo mien was good. Sesame beef comes breaded my wife said it was ok. The review was how they handled it and the quality of the chicken mainly."}
{"text":"We had the Bombay Chicken at the recommendation of the server, they may have a good lunch special but $11.50 for take out dinner puts it above-average in price. 

The decor was typical, the place looked clean and the servers seemed attentive while we waited. I also wanted to eat this in the car but they didn't provide any plastic forks or napkins on a takeout order, really?? Isn't that pretty standard? It was a very painful ride home as the whole car smelled like spice & everything nice.

Low and behold it was very spicy! I haven't had to drink a glass of milk when I order 'spicy' for a while now. A nice kick to the sinuses. The flavour was pretty good from what I could tell (with my mouth being on fire and everything). The portion size was huge, and it had a lot of chicken which I appreciate although I missed the caramelized onions that usually come in a dish like this. The rice was dry, how do you mess up rice? It's so easy! The chicken was also a bit dry, which is an obvious sign of being reheated (aside from the 5 minutes it took to \"cook\" my order)

All in all it was decent but unfortunately didn't sooth my melt-in-your-mouth this-is-why-i-love-hakka craving."}
{"text":"This place was highly suggested; however, when Shane and I showed up the only thing that looked good about this place was an oceanic painting on the wall.  I give this place a one star because the food was hot and ready in like 5 minutes, but the appearance was interesting.  I ordered orange chicken; you can't really mess up orange chicken rite?  Well the supposed fried rice was just white rice drenched in soy sauce and the noodles looked old and gross.  The orange chicken tasted nothing like orange and it looked like it was previously frozen.  Sorry peeps I will not be going back to the Golden China.  PS not sure why they are called \"Golden\" China as there was nothing golden about this place."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal, as is the service! Everything is cooked to order, so you won't get old food that's been sitting around. We order from here about once a month and it is always consent. They give free 2 liter drinks and Chinese donuts with large orders, and since I'm always ordering for my family of four, we always get these free perks! The staff is friendly and remember you when you're a regular. Best Chinese takeout I've been to in a while...so much so, that I drive past the one closest to my house to go to this one. Do yourself a favor and check them out!"}
{"text":"I've never dined in, only done take out. Food is always hot and delicious--even after the 15-20 minute drive home. Staff is not noticeably  friendly but I find that is standard for Chinese restaurants of this sort. Prices and portions are comparable to the nearby Chinese restaurants.  I think chopsticks are only given by request but that is okay since it is agonizing to eat my favorite dish, shrimp fried rice, with chop sticks."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Hakka. As everyone else mentioned, the (dry) chili chicken was delicious. It really was the perfect amount of spice - barely got my nose sniffly. I would say it was the best dish. We also got schezuan beef. The dish was unique, but it wasn't for me. I am not a huge fan of super saucy dishes, and the flavour itself wasn't for my taste. On an unbiased note, it was definitely different and unique compared to regular schezuan beef. Lastly, we ordered the Hakka chicken chow mein. It was nothing out of the ordinary, tasted like regular chow mein to me. I liked it though.

On an unbiased note, the dry chili chicken and the schezuan beef definitely stood out the most.

On a personal/preference note, I liked the dry chili chicken the best, and also the hakka chicken chow mein.

In terms of service, the waiter was courteous enough. I did notice a smile/smirk as we ordered food - did he think we were ordering too much? What's with the smirk? I wouldn't say it was a snooty smirk, but watch your expressions - some people know how to read facial expressions.

Also, we noticed a 10% service charge on the bill. We did the calculations later and it was not 10% off for paying cash. We are not sure if it was because we took the rest the food to go, or if it was an automated 10% tip.

Overall, the food was better than the service we received (mainly due to the smirk and the confusing 10% charge). We may come back for the chili chicken and try some new items, but overall, we will try other hakka restaurants to see what's out there."}
{"text":"This Hakka (Indian/chinese) style restaurant is amazing! They are open 6 days a week, closed on Tuesdays. My family and I discovered this little - easy to miss- restaurant when it first opened.. and thank goodness for that, ever since we have been loyal customers. 

They have great tasting food, very fresh ingredients; We usually stick to our regulars (which are the best in comparison to other Hakka style restaurants in the area) Chili chicken, Manchurian fried rice/ noodles, hot garlic chicken.. The lunch deals are pretty cheap and they give generous portions. The regular dining prices are average.
Golden China has super friendly staff; Charlie the owner, and his wife are awesome! They will often try to alter a dish if you request it (as I like my chili chicken less spicy than usual). 

This place is a must try if you want some delicious and spicy Hakka style food."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Went in to eat. There was not one customer in the place. After sitting there for 15 minutes and NEVER once greeted,we decided to leave. The owner as well as the cooks and delivery driver knew we were sitting there as they looked at us several times. As we were leaving, the delivery driver gave us a dirty look and watched us walk out. As if we did something wrong!! NEVER GOING BACK!!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely inexpensive with very friendly staff!!! The food is delish! I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"This review is based on delivery only as I have not been to the restaurant yet.   Everything I've ordered has been great, love the Singapore noodles, and the portions are great for the price.  The delivery has always been super fast and only a $2 delivery charge."}
{"text":"This place is the 2nd best place ever must try on a cold sorry so short but i need to eat"}
{"text":"This little family run restaurant serves delicious Hakka food. Lunch specials are $6.2 which is a steal; portions are very generous too.
Chilli chicken was quite yummy; good flavour and good amount of spiciness. Hot garlic chicken was spicy and garlicky. 
I like the food and will definitely come back for more take out."}
{"text":"Finally a decent Chinese restaurant!!! Their spring rolls and pork fried rice are so good! Also the cream cheese rangoon yessssss! Been here twice so far and love it.. Hot and sour soup is super tasty and the eggplant !! We get it without tofu and it is so good! Spicy and sweet and so tender! I dig this place! Good prices, big portions, good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"The eggplant is to die for. I don't know how they do it but it is absolute perfection. I order it without the tofu as I'm not a fan. It is simply eggplant, sauce (spicy) and scallions and it is AMAZING!

Their NY style egg rolls remind me of the kind I had growing up in the Detroit area. The wrap and the filling are different and they're pretty amazing. 

Watching my calorie intake is usually hard with Chinese restaurants - especially since I am allergic to broccoli but the eggplant dish makes it alllll good :)

The staff has always been friendly and service has always been quick."}
{"text":"New business opened up in the little shopping mall next to Albertson's on Buffalo and Vegas Dr. They advertised Boba teas on the window so I decided to drop in for some dinner and drink to go. Its your typical chinese restaurant with a few tables, and mostly food to go orders. They do deliver within 3 miles if you are so inclined.

I went with my standard crab rangoon, and this was a standard crab rangoon. Big crispy wonton wrapper with a mediocre amount of rangoon. Same as you get everywhere so probably pre-packaged. 3/5

Next was BBQ pork and vegetables. This was steaming hot when I got home 6 minutes later and it was good, but again, nothing out of the ordinary. Pork lacked a little of that BBQ flavor. Nice selection of veggies and a decent sauce. 3/5

Thai tea with boba - I liked this version because you get a strong tea flavor mixed in with the milky part. Boba was plentiful, I wasn't even able to finish all the boba in the drink. 4/5

Extensive menu with many options, broken down into pork, chicken, beef, etc. Chinese food lovers will find something they like. I'm not a huge Chinese food fan, so not sure if I'll return for anything other than a Boba tea."}
{"text":"Was hoping for a new place to get Chinese food. I placed an order to go , service was very friendly and fast. The food on the other hand was horrible. Springs very greasy, and so was the tasteless fried rice and chow mien Tried their special chicken wings, I took one bite and spit it out. It was like putting a tablespoon of salt in my mouth. Unfortunately I ended up throwing it away and having a P and J for dinner. I'll never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Just moved over to this side of town! Tried to order Chinese food for delivery. This was my fourth call because apparently a lot of Chinese food joints over here don't do delivery? Incredibly odd to me.. Anyways. They were nice over the phone I ordered orange chicken, vegetable lo mein, and 2 orders of crab puffs for 27 bucks. They were here in about 25 minutes the estimated about 30-40 so that was a pleasant surprise.   The food was okay.. The orange chicken looked and tasted just as great. The noodles were bland.. Maybe a little under cooked they look light my colored and didn't have much flavor at all. The crab puffs were good but there was only like a spoonful of cram/cream cheese mixture in there.. Which was kind of disappointing because that's my favorite part. Will definitely try again maybe it was an off night for the noodles and crab puffs."}
{"text":"This place is nestled in a shopping center, like most are, but I am glad we got a mailer to try this place. They give good size portions on their food. Their Lo Mein and Fried Rice and Sweet N Sour Chicken was very good and had lots of flavor, that is hard to find a good Chinese place around town here. I will go back but I never known about this place if it wasn't for the mailer that we go to go  and try them out. The employees were very polite and happy to wait on us. They would be good to take home food also. I would recommend trying this at least once and then maybe this will be one of your favorite spots in town. I will be back to try other items. Their interior was clean, and well kept."}
{"text":"I gotta say! WOW 3rd time no complainers! Fresh! Hot! Yummy! Egg foo young......... Home run! Fair fast delivery! I would stay away from wonton soup! Was just ok ! But everything else was really good ! I never dealt with a person other then delivery man because I used grub hub but order always correct! 5 stars all the way around! Considering the other place around me are gross you go into store and salt shaker is stuck to table......is it glued ? Nope! Or the other place is on dirty dining. ......... AGAIN! Nope so far this place rocks !"}
{"text":"Nothing really stood out about the restaurant. The food was decent; the customer service was okay. The portions were pretty big so you do get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Have the lunch with friends, I order the chicken lettuce w and the honey walnut shrimp, it was very delicious. Will come back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had pad Thai it's was good and I got Mongolian beef that was absolutely fantastically amazing. It's a family owned business. It was a bit pricey but it was worth it. Big portions and kid friendly."}
{"text":"I am sad to report that this newer location has already gone down hill. 

There is no consistency as the taste of the food really depends on who is preparing it. 

They charge a lot for dinner meals and the quality, value and flavor is lacking.

When they first opened they were really good for lunch specials, the taste, quality and portion was great.

My last visit I got the orange chicken and cashew chicken dinner combos and it was styrofoam packages of slop. 

I am disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Great food and great pricing. Had the Orange Chicken, lunch special. Very clean and very friendly."}
{"text":"Once again perseverance  pays off. I am a newbie to South Carolina originally from Long Island NY. So we love our food and Chinese is at the top of the list, next to Italian which is my nationality lol. 

I have tried about 4 that we're not even close to the worse Chinese places in NY. 

I almost gave up hope but decided to try one more time before I would give up. Glad I stuck it out!  This is better than most NY places I've gone to.  Most of the restaurants I would compare this place to closed down after hurricane Sandy hit in 2012 so honestly, this beats the last several places I went to in NY too. 

The beef and broccoli, honey chicken and boneless ribs are not some left over food. The fried rice tastes fresh and the egg roll does not taste greasy. 

Also the food DOES NOT have the aftertaste of other cooked food lingering from an earlier order. 

Ordered in person around 2 pm and was out by about 2:15. The only problem is there is no delivery service at this time, but they do take visa and MasterCard. 

I can only say THIS THE PLACE TO GO! TRUST US NYers!"}
{"text":"Never ever disappointed. Made to order fresh ingredients. Workers are very nice some are shy. I really love hot and sour soup it is amazing. Call in to order or use EAT24 for delivery. Some of you may see the food as plain but I'd rather be able to add salt pepper spice condiments what ever I want to it than to have it too salty too spicy or something you can't fix. This restaurant is organized & very clean."}
{"text":"If you're looking for inexpensive lunch then this a good place. Lunch special is $6.20 plus a can of pop. I'll say the food is average (better than food court food), but for the price I think it's worth it. The portion is also huge! 

I had the General Tao Chicken lunch special. The chicken was tender and the overall taste was pretty good."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant ,here foods so delicious and fresh !hot sour soup it's my favorite,I think this is the best Chinese restaurant in this town !"}
{"text":"Great food, great family that owns the restaurant, (customer service is excellent) and a good price. First time there. Will be going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I just went for the 900th time today (not really but it's a mainstay) and it's STILL FREAKING AWESOME.

Great job, nice people, you just feel good going here."}
{"text":"Love this place went there lady night and had a great meal the food was so fresh the place was clean and the staff very friendly. We will be back so take the time to enjoy"}
{"text":"Reasonable priced for the quantity served, very large servings. Taste was average to good. a little more homemade quality than fast food."}
