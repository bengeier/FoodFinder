{"text":"Delicious food!  I normally get take out as I live right down the street and it is always done within 10-15 mins, like they say.  I've dined in about 4 times and each time it was pretty slow inside but unlike the other reviewers, we had very quick service.  Actually, my entree came out while I was still eating appetizer & soup so I was kind of sad.  lol.    I LOVE the decor.  It's not over the top, pretending like we're actually IN Thailand, but it's dark & sensual & usually very quiet, a great place to take a date.  The staff is super friendly and actually speak English too!    I am vegan (no meat, no egg, no dairy) and I order all kinds of special dishes and they never mess it up.  My favorite dishes there are Pan Fried Glass Noodles, Galanga noodle curry & Pad Si Ew.  The sticky rice is AMAZING too!!!  LOVE GALANGA THAI!!!  :)"}
{"text":"1 star for the poor service.  The one woman running the front of the house lacked customer service skills.  She was not pleasant at all. Food was mediocre and was served without serving utensils. When we requested serving utensils the woman was displeased that we even asked for them. The only time she somewhat cracked a smile, if it was even a smile, was when I asked for the check. There are definitely much better Thai places in town. Not coming back."}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD FOOD ESPECIALLY The sticky Rice mango dessert, the drunken noodle and the potsticker the chicken one"}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant through Yelp mobile. I ordered a chow mein version dish. Although I really liked the service of the lady (there was about 3 tables being served including mine). The dish was very salty, I did not enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"After spending a whole day on the strip, we came back to our hotel that was south of the strip.  Looked on here for some delivery and was surprised to find delivery Thai food.  We took our chances not expecting much and were extremely pleased with the big portions and the quality.  The roti canai was amazing, as well as the Panang and drunken noodles.  We were so thrilled about this food that we tried calling in for more later in the week, but were extremely disappointed to see that they were closed without any sort of warning, on a Thursday night.  Otherwise I woulda had no problem giving Galanga 4 stars."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY!!! I've ate here many many times and it's always great!!! Curry, rice, apps everything I've tried is great!   This is definitely a take out kind of joint. The interior decor leaves something to be desired. However, they always have my order ready to go as soon as I arrive.   Chicken satay, yellow curry, Thai chow mein are some of my favorites."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast and delicious.  Highly recommended.  I had the orange sauce chicken, which was great, coconut soup, and chicken satay skewers.  I have no complaints and everything I tried was spot on."}
{"text":"Another solid 4 stars for this place.  Yeah it is dead, but that's one of the things I like about it.  I love coming here and relaxing and listening to the off-beat jazz or satellite music they have.  It is so much different than the \"busy\" atmosphere of Pin Kaow.  And way cheaper too.  I also love the $5.00 lunch special!  I think a lot of the reviews who say it takes forever to eat are really, really hungry.  I'm in and out of here in 30-45 minutes.    Come and enjoy it!  All the curries and soups I've had here are really good!  Support Silverado Ranch businesses :)"}
{"text":"Great spot. Used to be full restaurant around corner from me. Since moving down the street, it's mainly a take out/delivery joint, but the food is still great. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and portions.  I still enjoy dining in the restaurant though small, service is still great.  They do get busy with the pick up/delivery orders. So sometimes it seems like you are only one there when in fact they are really busy.  It often looks closed but very very happy it's still opened.  One of the few quick healthy options around. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I'd give it five stars if they offered beer/wine.  Four of us went on Friday evening and the place was empty.  Most likely due to the fact that you can't get beer/wine.  We all ordered something different from the $12.95 dinner special, which offered an appetizer, soup, and entree, and desert. Coffee/Tea also included.  We chose the satay, the pot stickers, ragoon, and fried tofu for appetizers.  Very small sizes, really just a taste, but won't complain as the soup size was good and the dinner plates were full size.  Only thing that I wouldn't order again was the tofu.  Pot stickers were great.  Soup, they offer a couple different, basically a coconut and a spicy soup, both what you'd expect from a good Thai place.  Lot's of lemon grass and very good.  Main dish we had pad thai, yellow curry, peanut chicken, and one other thing I can't remember, except they were all good.  Spiciness levels varied greatly as I order a 4 (out of five) which was less hot than a friend that ordered a two and she couldn't finish due to heat.  Desert was coconut pudding and cream, sticky rice and ice cream and a banana eggroll thing.  All good, but I'd stick with the coconut thing.  Can't beat the price and the quality and flavor was a good as Pin Kaow for far less money. Unlike other reviews we had zero problems with speed of service, but this seems it could be the case during the busy lunch hours."}
{"text":"I went there for tom yum noodle soup. The food is not very good it's not an original tom yum noodle soup. I feel like it it's come from the instant noodle package. The waitress is nice, the atmosphere is fairly good but really small and there're too many table for the space. I will give it a try for something else that not Tom Yum noodle soup."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai food. I am a sucker for Tom ka. I also love the pineapple fried rice. This is a great place."}
{"text":"Place a little small Had take out food was really good  Seafood soup a little different then I'm accustomed to but it was pretty good food was ready when I got there no waiting and got."}
{"text":"I went there last nite . I ordered the soft crab and eggplants with shrimp with crab fried rice . All the dishes is good . The complementary rice is disgusting. It looks like over a week and it is over cook. I definitely won't come back again ."}
{"text":"Driving nearly 3,000 miles without stopping for a night what can be better then stopping for some Pad Thai made to order with all my crazy allergies and requests before arriving home at midnight."}
{"text":"Coconut soup was soooo good. I didnt get any pics but it was delivered by UBER was still quite hot and so delicious. I can't wait to have it again."}
{"text":"Cozy little spot. I got the Pad Soon Wen which is pretty basic, but it was still delicious. I'll definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery while staying at our nearby timeshare. Delivery was on time, but the food was just ok, and the portions were SO SMALL. We were extremely disappointed, given what we paid. Will not be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"AgaIn, still the best peanut curry chicken in the area. Fresh rolls are perception, but really consider the peanut sauce instead of the garlic.   What convinced me of the total awesomeness of the place that while I was typing this, a Thai family came in to eat and they were talking amongst themselves about how good it is when they eat here. Wow! And yes indeed :)  Anyhoo - Get to Vegas, get here, get good stuff!!!  Yum"}
{"text":"If you go in during lunch time, ask to see the lunch specials! You're presented with a regular menu first which doesn't list the lunch specials that they have but has a wide selection of food. So I ordered to-go from the lunch menu here, which is a pretty good deal. It ranges from like 6-8$ depending on what kind of meat you choose.   If you do so, I would suggest getting items that have noodles in them, as you seem to get more food entree-wise. I got the Pad Si Ew with chicken and Kung Pao beef. Both came with a spring  roll (I think they call it a Thai egg roll or something though). The Kung Pao came with rice as well but the Pad Si Ew didn't which wasn't a big deal to me since there seemed to be more food in there anyways.   They do their spice level from 1-5 and since it was my first time I requested a 2 for both dishes just to be safe. I generally like a mild spice so a 2 wasn't bad.   Overall I think it's a good place to try but I'm giving 4 stars because there was significantly less food in the Kung Pao beef than in the Pad Si Ew. But all in all a good place to eat and I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Good was amazingly on point!!! First time ordering food from here, we are most definitely ordering from here again. I ordered the Pork Larb with sticky rice and my boss ordered the Galanga Plate. She also order the Thai tea and sweet sticky rice and she loved it!! Delivery was fast and he was friendly as well."}
{"text":"Moved to the area and wanted to try this place out, but seen the posts about it being closed. Got a flyer on our door from them the other day and was probably more excited than I should have been, lol. It did not disappoint. The pad thai and spicy noodles were great along with the pot stickers. I think next time I'm gonna try the peanut curry. It will definitely be the new go to, especially since it's right across the street."}
{"text":"So far so good, always love a Thai tea thats free at check in. Woot! CHEERS!  Great location, friendly staff, authentic food, and I have a delicious person to do all this with"}
{"text":"nice and quiet place. great service. food came fast. ordered food  2/5 on spiciness scale but was still very spicy so order accordingly. prices are average. portions large. regular steamed rice was a bit plain-- seems like very cheap rice. delicious thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have had in Vegas.  Tom yum gai soup has layers of flavor.  They delivery and so far have never had any issues, brought me a free Thai because they felt it took to long, even though I had no complaints.   My go to dish at any Thai place is the basil chicken dish, chicken is ground not chopped which allows the meat to soak up more flavor of the delicious spicy savory sauce.  The dinning room is very tiny maybe room for 15 people, so I think they survive on delivery and take out.  Prices are very reasonable service has always been great,  However if your looking for alcohol they do not offer any.  Other than than that one thing, I would still say just going by food they execute the curry and other dishes very well, BTW I have visited Thailand on several occasions if you want to add in those two cents."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have found in the Las Vegas area.  The prices are great and the food is well prepared. I especially love the Galanga Curry, chicken satay, coconut soup, crab rangoon, ginger chicken, etc. I could probably keep listing, but the items listed above are my \"must-haves.\"   I do not like how stingy they are with the rice and if you ask for more than the single scoop, they charge $1-2 extra. The service is extremely slow, as they only have one server at a time and she is there EVERY SINGLE day.   This is a Mom & Pop shop, it's close to my house and easy to get to-go food from. I will keep coming back as long as they are serving food! Which I was concerned about when I first started partonizing, but as of late, there are more people in the restaurant. I tell everyone I know. I want to keep this place in business!"}
{"text":"Myself and a buddy of mine just so happened upon this small hole in the wall in the area that we had just moved to and we thought we'd give it a shot. I was amazed  at not only the quality of food but the service as well. They had more than adequate portions for the dishes that we'd tried which were the \"Pad Thai\" and the \"Mei Fun\" noodles. I'm no judge of authenticity but whatever I had wasn't disappointing at all. They even have asian deserts and beverages such as boba and mocha ice cream, perfect for those of you that have a sweet tooth!  The place is kind of small and sticks to its description of \"hole I  the wall\" but is very charming for its size. It's a perfect hang out spot for a small group of friends after a long day of activity.   My experience as far as service was awesome sadly I forgot the name of the waitress who served me but she saw that while I was waiting for my dish I had already finished the \"green tea boba\"  beverage that i had ordered and offered me another one, on the house!! I don't know if she was just feeling generous, but as a customer, it sure made my day!!  Thanks Galanga we'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Friendly owner, free Thai iced tea with Yelp or Fb check in and decent Thai food . Place is small but that doesn't bother us. Location is convenient for us so we'll be back"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and they make it to where u can choose your level of spice and I like it spicy. Best off all they deliver which is hard to get by a quality place."}
{"text":"I wanted to try it out for lunch, when I walked in it was empty, asked to use the restroom first and they don't have one for their customers!!! Why would you not have a restroom for your customers? Had to go to Chase next door, while I was there I asked how's the Thai restaurant next door, the teller replied \"my co-workers got sick after eating there\" glad I had to use the restroom first."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was absolutely delicious. The green curry was a big hit with my mother-in-law and the giant Tom Yum was to die for. The only drawback (and it was a big one) was that my MIL and I were quite sick afterwards. This is the reason that the restaurant only gets three stars. I'm sure this is an isolated incident, as we are big fans of Thai food."}
{"text":"Boyfriend loved the dumplings and curry, but I thought that all the food that should have been light and tasty were overcooked.  I do not like having my self shell crab salad done cooked.  It should be with a nice crisp salad with a light sauce."}
{"text":"We ordered from them for the first time using eat24hours.  The delivery time says 45-60 min and it took every second of 60 minutes for them to get here (even though we live only about 5 min away).  We ordered their Thai Egg Rolls, Pad Thai (Chicken/Hot), and Spicy Fried Rice (Chicken/Very Hot).  The flavor of the food was good, but the quality was just okay.  Since it took so long for them to deliver (although I should mention that it was a Friday, so that might be why), the food was cold.  I would say that the quantities of the food wasn't as liberal as some of the other places that we have been to here in Vegas and the prices were roughly the same.  I think that if you're in the area and are going out to eat somewhere casual, this might be an okay place to try, but if you're going to be ordering out/delivery I would try somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of the best places for Thai food I have had in the US. Every entrée I have tried here is awesome. And the lunch price is amazing. You can't go wrong whatever you order. I go there almost everyday for lunch. Owners are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Lunch specials here are a super deal. You can spend $4.95 or $5.95 depending on how many side dishes you want. I had the Yellow Chicken Curry, and it was delicious. The Galanga Rolls were fantastic too. If you like Thai Food, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times, I've been very satisfied with the food.  Pad See Ew - Delicious! I always add both chinese broccoli and regular white onions as an addition. Chicken Satay - Moist and flavorful. Chicken skewers tend to get really dry, but not at Galanga. The peanut dipping sauce is the perfect compliment.  The lady who works the counter (Jib, i think is her name) is very friendly, helpful and always smiling.  The reason I give them 4 stars is because they need better seating."}
{"text":"A hidden gem is an understatement!  The price is right for good proportions of high quality authentic Thai food.  Every entrée is great from this place but I recommend trying their coconut rice pudding dessert!"}
{"text":"First time here. Loved it. Food was great and Jamie was genuinely interested in giving me a great experience. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here with the Groupon to try it and it was good food. The restaurant area doesn't instill much confidence as it's very small and odd looking with just a beverage cooler in it.  I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the seating area. The bathroom wasn't immediately accessible which felt weird. My advice would be to get food to go!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, with a great lounge jazz meets thai vibe. Price is on par with other Thai restaurants.  Ingredients look and taste really fresh, great presentation."}
{"text":"We love the food and service. The staff is great! The prices are right too. A bit of a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Well I'm a fan of curry and decided to try there's red curry of coarse, wen I got. Back to work with my food I wasn't happy that there was so much vegetables and barley any chicken. Also I order a side of noodles and they gave me steamed noodles I wanted the flavored noodles, the counter lady barley understood me and had no knowledge of English, the atmosphere is dull and lifeless"}
{"text":"Nice place! Good service and fast delivery!  It only took 10 mins for my pick up order to be ready. Highly recommended for quick take out."}
{"text":"Horrible, I had a order of Panang Curry and it was delivered in a melted styrofoam container. The styrofoam had melted into the curry and was not edible aside from the fact that the panang curry had cooked carrots and green beans in it. The coconut chicken soup was watery and lacked flavor. Very low quality and underwhelming Thai food."}
{"text":"Keeping it simple!  I Like this place, it's always a good quality tasting meal consistently prepared to perfection. Never had a bad meal here!Staff is wonderful and pleasant. Prices are great!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. I think there are other Thai places in Vegas that would be a better option. The service was horrible it gets 0 stars. I walked in after ordering over the phone for carry out (literally 5 minutes since I was in the neighborhood)& I was with my bf. I had a groupon (I rarely use Groupon) and she informed me that it could only be used for dine in... I admit that was my fault so me and my bf asked if we could change it to dine in then. She rolled her eyes and brought out our food by throwing it on the table (no I am not exaggerating) she didn't ask us about drinks ... I have never been so uncomfortable eating somewhere... it was incredibly awkward. The bill also had a bunch of numbers all over it and stuff crossed off like a large algebra equation. I paid $30 AFTER the groupon for me and my bf. The Groupon takes $20 off ... so... How? I don't know. She said something about the catfish doesn't count ? Lol But I didn't even care I just wanted to get out of there. I am sad though since this place is close to my house and the food wasn't horrible but whatever I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a deal, it is only 5.94 for the lunch special. That price includes tax :)  Oh and the saying goes, you get what you pay for is true in this case. It might be because I had better, but don't expect to get tasty Thai food from this place because you will be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite. I always order delivery from this place. Foods good and I get my food pretty quick."}
{"text":"food is decent. The place is small but okay for lunch type of place the service was great as I was the only person in the place. the prices are decent overall was not great but not bad..."}
{"text":"A very nice restaurant with excellent service and food! I also get many great travel suggestions. Next time when I visit Vegas, I will come the restaurant first!"}
{"text":"The food from here is always good and it's always pretty large portions. They are very quick with delivering food. Good lunch specials if you were to sit in the actual restaurant. The restaurant is small so I prefer to have it delivered. They are always nice and courteous. We eat there about once a week and we've never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Best Food ! Good price !! friendly service !!! Curry here very delicous . Galanga Curry so good !!!!  Eggplants Basil very good too !!!!! ^_^"}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan of the pad thai, maybe it's just preference. I will definitely eat the grilled chicken plate again it's a great taste, price and deal! You get a plate of fried rice, 3 or so grilled pieces of chicken, spring rolls and sauce. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!!!     Excellent Service, The food was amazing, fresh and so much flavor, Had the spicy noodle, jumbo shrimp garlic, coconut soup"}
{"text":"I ordered and picked up today and it was ready when I arrived. I saw the good reviews and thought I would try something new.  It was average at best. The food wasn't bad. But it definitely wasn't  the best. The papaya salad was a little bitter because the papaya was a little too raw (?), the pad see ew was a little soy saucey, and the Tom yum soup was a little too sweet for my taste.   I wouldn't say it was bad either though. It was ok. I just don't think it would be somewhere I would think of as my first choice (or second, or maybe not even top 5) for Thai food."}
{"text":"Love this little thai place. If you are in the neighborhood, stop by for a pickup order.  (There is SUPER limited seating).   They have some super fresh dishes here with wonderful flavors.   Don't eat the standard faire.   Try something you wouldn't normally order and be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"My bf and I love this place! We probably go here a few times a month, sometimes even a few times a week. Little hole in the wall spot. Love their red curry more than most places in vegas. The lady that works there is THE SWEETEST. We've ate there so many times she's remembered our order. It's rarely busy with dine-ins, mostly take out or delivery orders. It made for the perfect Valentine's Day dinner."}
{"text":"excellent food, great prices, service is fast and the food is hot. I like coming here, conveniently located on the south end of town but in Vegas Blvd, so easy access. I recommend the pineapple curry"}
{"text":"The server literally brought the check by more times than she refilled our water.  Each scoop of rice is $2, which was also petty annoying, but the food was good."}
{"text":"I would say this is my current favorite Thai restaurant and a frequent go-to for take out. My review is based solely on the food since I have not dined in and have always opted for take out.  The portions are generous and price point is reasonable enough to make it a worthy option for take out.   I love their chicken wings; crispy and marinated to perfection in sweet chili sauce. I do believe they have basil sauce option for the wings as well, but have yet to try it. Chicken Satay Skewers are also a great \"appetizer\", but the portion is so large that simply ordering that and a cucumber salad can be a complete meal.   I am a Pad Kee Mao fanatic so it goes without saying that it is my frequent go to. They are very generous with the protein and the dish is not comprised of 95% noodles, onions and peppers like many I have tried before. I am a fan of the shrimp and chicken but they do have several other meat options as well as tofu if meat isn't your thing.   I also enjoyed their Grilled Plate with pork, egg roll and fried rice...it is a pretty straight forward dish, but a great filler when you are doing family style dining.  We are also fans of their Panang Curry with duck (extra $5), although the up charge for duck is higher, they are very generous with the portions of duck and meat is of higher quality. Lastly. when I am in the mood for something lighter Pad Woon Sen with chicken is an excellent, light yet refreshing option. Since my pregnancies my tolerance for spicy food has gone down immensely so I have become a weenie when it comes to spicy dishes and usually opt for 1 or 2 which are just right. Thanks kids for the acid reflux so severe that led to GERD. You are a gift that keeps on giving.  I do plan on exploring more of the menu, but it appears I have found a dish I enjoy to suit my mood and craving at that time."}
{"text":"This is a good take out place.  It's too bad they're take out only.  I love their food and use them because they make my favorite dish- Singapore noodles.  Just wish it wasn't so expensive!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Always keep coming back for my Fried Thai rice with tofu. And Thai Tea!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Second time in there, first time was a few months ago and I ordered some tofu soup as I was not feeling well and that was delicious, staff was friendly, today I went in to get some pork dumplings and BBQ pork fried rice.    Soooo good!  The lady who helped me was friendly   :)     Going back next week, in fact I think I will make it a habit to stop in at least once a week to get something!  Super clean by the way, beautifully decorated, soothing music, it was nice, wish I could have sat down and had my meal.   :D    Next time!"}
{"text":"Came here off a recommendation for a good Thai restaurant away from the strip.  The lady at my timeshare suggested Galanga.  It is located in a strip mall and is pretty small (but cute) inside.  It is clean and does have a handful of tables you can dine at.  It was pretty busy during lunch time with most people opting for carry out.  Ordered the Crab Raviolis/Rangoon and it was delicious.  Comes with sweet and sour sauce to dip.  Tried the shrimp Pad Thai noodle mild and it was awesome.  Lots of shrimp and the sauce was flavorful with the right amount of spice.  The soups sounded good but didn't have any room to try any on this trip.  Good size portions, attentive table service make this place a solid winner in my book."}
{"text":"Such a lovely small restaurant! The Pad Thai was authentically Thai and the fresh rolls were wonderful. Dining partner had the Penang curry Thai hot and stated it was great! Service was exceptional! Please give them a try!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas! I love the authenticity and the environment. The food is also great too. My favorite is the yellow curry. The flavors are so rich and the price is good. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ms Galanga is always so pleasant. She knows our order: Thai fried rice, pad see ew, yellow curry"}
{"text":"Yummo!If you are looking for a good Thai restaurant this is the place to go! The customer service is awesome! The pad Thai is my favorite! It is soooooo good! And the best part is that sometimes it comes with a free Thai tea! Could it get any better? Like I said if you want Thai don't think twice!"}
{"text":"food was full of flavors, the staff was very sweet and attentive. my family and friend truly enjoyed our dining experience. safe to say we will be back"}
{"text":"Every year while visiting vegas, I make a point to stop at this restaurant. One of the top thai places I have visited in the country. The panang curry here is the best I have ever had in my life. Also the thai ice tea is simply superb. The staff is really nice and the place is neat and clean."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Yeah, big deal, they dont have much for seating... But think about it... That makes the price of the food stay lower for people like me who really appreciate delivery and take out! Bottom line, dont come here to sit inside and eat. Come here to pick up your food or sit comfortably at home waiting for your delivery,  Low prices and high quality. My yellow curry had purple potatoes in it! Those arent the cheap ones. My dish was absolutelt perfect, as was my boyfriends pad thai.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"simple/small place. ok service and ok food"}
{"text":"Excellent quick lunch. Cozy atmosphere and very friendly service. Very tasty Thai food."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and they sell Boba Tea! Only draw back is no Bathroom at this \"restaurant\"!! What happens when you need to wash your hands before and after a meal?! IDK bout that situation. So bring your own wet naps!"}
{"text":"This is one of our go to Thai places. The lettuce wraps and sticky rice and mangos are my new favorite! The service is great!"}
{"text":"This by far is the best place to get Thai curry. I always get the galanga curry with chicken and spice level 10. This is the most authentic tasting and actually accurate spice level place ever. I've ordered spice level 10 from other places but it always takes like a 3 or 4. Service is good. Water kinda tastes funny but whatever. BEST CURRY EVER!!"}
{"text":"Wow food was so good and Iam very picky with thai food. Next time I would order it Spicier though slightly on the mild side spice wise. But great flavor. I love that they deliver and bring extra sauce. Also a low minimum for delivery price. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I can only speak to the Pad Thai because that's what I've ordered the three times I've been there, but it is EXCELLENT.  I'm not gonna try to describe the flavors but just know that it's very good and I'd highly recommend it.  The place isn't too fancy in the inside but seems to be clean and does the trick.   I think I've had the same server all three times I've been there and she is attentive enough and fills up the water when necessary, so that's all good with me.  I think that the chicken pad Thai was about $8.99, which is reasonable, especially for the solid portion they give."}
{"text":"First time I came here, I recognized Timothy Hutton (Leverage on TNT) who apparently goes there when he's in town.  But I suppose who cares if you don't watch the show.    I enjoy the lunch special options Galanga offers.  My big gripe is really the time it takes for the food to come out.  I have waited up to 40 minutes to be served.  It's not a like a Thai five course meal for crissakes.      The service is attentive so no issues there before AND after the food is served.  They have 5 levels of spiciness.  So I asked for a 1 on the spice level for my chicken curry and swear my dish was hotter than a co-workers curry.  So what's the point I suppose.    Anyone coming here for lunch, I would recommend blocking out 90 minutes seriously because you might just have to wait under an hour before you're served!"}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome service. I ordered the chicken noodle soup, Thai Mongolian, fish cakes and eggplant basil. They're all yummy."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is awesome, the server - a nice Thai lady - is a great person, always smiling, she does great job!"}
{"text":"I was afraid of the old reviews of this place about the timeliness of their service.  I experienced slow service the first time we ate there and we were the only ones there.  Since then (and there have been lots of times eating in and delivery), they really stepped up on their service.  Their food is also great.  I don't get along well with eating spicy food and they really accommodate my needs.  I love the Panang Curry, Pad Thai, and Thai Fried Rice.  I order from  them once a week and have them deliver.  They are also prompt with their delivery now.  My advice is to forgo the lunch rush so you don't have a long wait time.  With their lunch specials starting at $5, they get swamped.  If you like Thai food, give this place a chance.  They really are worth the price and they need some more patrons."}
{"text":"We picked Galanga Thai based on location only.  We were looking for Thai food close to us.  Best proximity find ever.  The food was amazing, the portions were generous and the service was fantastic.    If you find yourself near Galanga Thai don't pass it up."}
{"text":"Super good Thai food place that is tucked away in a strip mall in South Vegas. They've won a bunch of awards for their food and they make all the great curry dishes like Green, Yellow, Panang and Massaman curries. Great place to grab some Thai take out and relax in your room."}
{"text":"this is the only place they give me enough tom yum soup for the price so I drive across town to get it.  Its delicious:)"}
{"text":"So they moved from a place that seated about 40-50 people to a place that seats less than 10 on bar stools.  If you  loved them before your still going to love them here,  but just you won't get the best dining experience (paper plates and plastic utensils).  They said they was going to add tables or even expand til then its probably recommend to make your to go.   Took pics of the menu, pics seemed ok but after uploading them they looked blurry.  The lunch special, starts at $5.49 give you a choice of around 20 dishes, from 5 different currys to Pad Thai and various meats, comes with rice and an egg roll. I personally like the Massaman (meat, potatoes, beans, onion, curry sauce) or panang currys. The perfect amount of heat and coconut milk that I've drank out of the container a few times when I was out of rice.  They have some soft shell crab for $19.99 which I haven't tried yet but think I'll try them soon. Crispy soft shell crabs with garlic butter sauce or honey ginger sauce. And boba drinks at around $2.50, soups, salads, noodles, desserts, other Thai dishes.  Located at corner of windmill and las Vegas blvd, on the same center as food4less and chevron."}
{"text":"Seriously.  This food is DELICIOUS, and omg they deliver!!!  I am staying at the Worldmark by Wyndham resort on S. Las Vegas Blvd. for the week, not exactly in the main action here in LV, and didn't feel like going out or cooking in tonight.  Checked on yelp and found this restaurant is close by.  Easily located their menu online (google searched: Galanga Thai Las Vegas menu), as well as lots of other sites with positive reviews, so decided to give it a shot.  When I called & asked if they deliver here, the (very nice) lady on the phone asked someone else & found out they do.  So I ordered one of the dinner specials--for about $13 I got:  Edamame as an app Cup of the tom kha gai (chicken coconut soup) Chicken panang curry entree Coconut rice pudding for desert    (Yes, I am in a coconut mood!  Lol)  Added in a thai iced tea (they packaged the ice cubes separately!! What a thoughtful touch!!) and then the $2 deliv charge, and it was still under $20 for delivery!!  And better yet--they estimated 40 min but were here in 20.  And the delivery guy was really nice, too.  I truly can't believe how delicious EVERYTHING was.  I wish this place was near my home in the SF Bay Area.  But I will be back to Vegas, and likely back to this same resort, so I will do this again.   Highly recommend this place.  Check their menu--looks like they have chinese food too."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable food, and SPICY food which I love.  I have had many dishes, all were good including the Spicy Seafood Soup about a level 7 is just a ridiculously spicy soup, which is hard to get while keeping a great flavor.  Small eating area, I always get for carry out or delivery as I live nearby.  If you like good Thai food, this is the place, they do a great job, convenient location at Blue Diamond and LV Blvd."}
{"text":"It's a hole-in-the-wall place, does a lot of take-out. Good food but even 3 out of 5 was SPICY!"}
{"text":"Thai tea tasted watered down and the Chicken Chow mien had no sauce no nothing on it. It's was literally just like noodles and chicken and barely a serving of vegetables all tossed together but nothing tying them together. Thank god I have Sriracha at my house to help salvage this meal"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, friendly staff. We won't be back though unless they move or build  restrooms on-site. We were told we would have to go next door to use the restroom; they don't have one in their building."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here.  The Pad See Moo was amazing and the service was excellent!  They also deliver which sounds like a good option if you live in the area and like Thai food."}
{"text":"I often order from here when I am at work and I have never been disappointed.  Their food is delicious! I love the yellow curry, coconut chicken soup, edamame, fried rice, crab raggons, lettuce wraps, and the side salad--Tried and tasted and 5 stars.... plus their delivery is quick and the guy is always so nice and happy. Great food!"}
{"text":"Came here because there was a groupon for it, came on a Sunday night. Restraunt wasn't packed at all and it seemed as this was more of a \"I SHOULD TAKE OUT\" food here because of the configuration of the spacing in the restaurant. The tables are packed together and you are really close to the neighboring table. We ordered:  Peanut curry with crispy pork (12.00)- DEF DEF 5 star- crunchy and sweet with an almost pad thai peanut sauce on it. Served with a pickled cabbage.  Roti kanai- fried bread with a red curry zucchini carrot dipping sauce- the dipping sauce was not the traditional roti Kanai sauce. It was more of like a thai red curry sauce. The bread also wasn't \"roti-Ish\"- it was more like oily fried flat bread- Not recommended  Tom kha soup: onion, green bell peppers, shrimp, green onion, mushrooms in a sweet coconut broth- Very sweet and non traditional. The soup was very very sweet and not like the sweet/sour/spicy soup that is normally served- Not recommended unless you like things on the more sweet side   Side rice: 1.99$- quite large portion    Most people were dining out and in the span of 30 min- there was about 6-10 take out orders on a sunday night. Like I said, the dining area was SUPER small- sat about 30 people (which seems like a lot) but isn't because all the tables are crammed together and there is about 1 foot of space between you and your neighbor table. Kinda uncomfortable for me. Also they seem very short staffed because there was only one lady working in the dinning room doing both the seated patron as well as the take out orders. SHE looked STRESSED out! Poor thing!  Will be returning for the peanut curry spicy crispy pork!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I think I had my weekly dose of sugar eating here!  If you like Pin Kaow, you'll like this spot.  The food seemes to be the typical Americanized Thai style food that you find in Vegas.  I will say that the atmosphere of the establishment is very cool though.  The interior decorating was very modern, mixed with some Thai decor.  Jazz music played constantly, making me feel like I was eating in some trendy corporate restaurant.   But enough of that, let's get to what really matters, the food!  The thai iced tea was ok, but a little watered down.  Thai iced tea is about the only thai food that I like sweet, and this was a bit lacking.  I ordered the yellow curry with chicken and sticky rice.  The sticky rice was very nice in the curry, but this was about all that I really liked about this dish.  The curry was the typical \"Pin Kaow\" curry; overly sweet and without any flavor that sets it apart.    For dessert I had the sweet sticky rice with mango ice cream.  This was like eating candy; it was way too sweet.  The presentation was nice though, with the sugary cream sauce covering the plate and the rice in the middle, with a single scoop of mango ice cream on top.  Nice looking, but way too sweet.  I didn't finish any of the dishes, they were just too sweet.  The service and the atmosphere were nice, but Pin Kaow clones are not the type of Thai restaurants that I prefer."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef jerky and squid salad through grubhub. The food came faster than the estimated 45-1hr wait so the food was prepared fast. Both items had amazing flavor and I love the beef jerky sauce. I'll try to visit this restaurant and dine in next time."}
{"text":"My fiance and I called in our order and when we arrived it was bagged, piping hot, and ready to be taken home. We ordered two lunch specials. I ordered the Green Curry with Tofu and Brown Rice, and he ordered the Spam Fried Rice with Beef. They were both delicious, filling, and I still have enough curry left over for another bowl or two. Great value and very tasty! We'll be back.  I'm glad they left their menu on our door. Otherwise, I never would and have known they were there.  Also, the dining room is quite small. I'd recommend taking the food to go if you're not a fan of cramped spaces. Everything did look clean though."}
{"text":"They are so kind and make you feel very comfortable. The environment is clean with pretty decor and relaxing music But let's talk about their food OMG  their peanut sauce is the best peanut sauce I've ever tasted  the mango with the sticky rice was actually super sweet (what do ya know a sweet mango)  I just love eating here. Highly recommend if you want a good meal in a chill environment with friendly service"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We enjoyed the Pad Thai and Spicy Noodles.  Thanks Yelpers for the tips to find this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Got take out. Very small restaurant. Got Thai Egg Rolls and taste like just got out from freezer and then fried. Not fresh. Got the Shrimp Tom Yum. Not authentic tasting. No lemongrass in it.  Got Pineapple Fried Rice and Pad See Eew. Both not as tasty compared to other Thai Restaurants. Not recommended."}
{"text":"First time ordering takeout from here and I was pretty impressed. Big portions and appropriate pricing. I ordered the Lao style papaya salad level 5 spice and it was good. Their spice level isn't true Thai spice so it won't burn your butt. I love the way they cut their chicken in the pad Thai & red curry. Not too thin but not thick and chunky. The red curry was a little thick and salty but I was happy that it wasn't overly sweet. I definitely want to try the rest of their menu. (Delivery was really fast as well.)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service - what else is there to say?  Had the beef pad Thai and the egg roll appetizer, both of which were excellent.  Pad Thai spiciness level was perfect and just what I asked for - medium hot (hot enough to be fun and interesting) but not so crazy hot that it made the food a chore to eat.  Many Thai restaurants I have been to can't get the balance right, but Galanga did!  Highly recommend this place to those of you who might be considering it."}
{"text":"Placing a delivery order over the phone is just painful.  I had to repeat myself again. And again.  And again.  I ordered the fresh Thai Spring Rolls and a chicken and shrimp pad thai spicy level 5.  The spring rolls fell apart as soon as I picked them up because the shell was too watery.  The pad thai was just dry and gross.  The chicken was so dry I ended up eating only the shrimp.  Not the best Thai food I've ever had.  Lots of room for improvement in service and quality of food.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I had a pad thai lunch special today. The egg roll was soggy. The pad thai was absolutely flavorless. Not even salty, and they don't put in any chopped peanuts or give you a lime wedge. Blah.  Service was fast, though."}
{"text":"Red curry was excellent.  Small place, but great food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Yellow combo meat curry was soooo good and the shrimp tom yum was amazing! Loaded with carrots and zucchini, I loved it. That's one of my fav soups, hard to please me. Ordered through grub and it was there in half of the estimated time, which is also awesome because they usually take forever, but it was New Year's Day, so I wasn't leaving my bed lol. Pad Thai was great as well. A+"}
{"text":"We usually pick up our food to go, it's good and cheap. Visited once for lunch, place was slow but food as good as always. Free Thai tea in yelp check in. (One per table)"}
{"text":"The food is really good. Tom kha gai soup is Delish! BUT, every time I call on Mondays they DO NOT answer! Just say you're closed on Mondays! Geez!"}
{"text":"This is a nice Thai restaurant in a good location, especially convenient for those who are vacationing at nearby resorts and want something nearby thats not fast food. It's located right next store to Smiths grocery which is also convenient. The restaurant is small but quaint and nicely decorated. Service was prompt and friendly. The food was very good! I had the noodle soup with chicken which hit the spot for my noodle soup craving and when I asked my companion if he liked the beef Pad Thai he said \"YES!\""}
{"text":"Dont let this small space fool you. The food is very good and the service prompt. Many Thai places don't use very fresh ingredients And I can taste the difference. This place uses fresh high quality ingredients"}
{"text":"Their food is good tasting and inexpensive. The yellow curry is my favorite. Their fried rice is simple and good. I always get delivery. Quick and reliable."}
{"text":"Thai me up and take me to a different Thai Restaurant. The price and the decor are the only things going for Galanga.   The RJ Food section gave them a cover story review and romanticized about the DIY Thai Iced Tea so since I am junkie for Thai Tea I had to experience this. The presentation was original with the tea iced cubes, but when I individually smelled one of the ingredients it smelled like nail polish remover. Ugh. Maybe my smeller was off so I continued making my tea combining all of the ingredients and it was a fail. I didn't enjoy it and spent most of my meal trying to make the damn tea taste better. FAIL.   Now for the food, the only thing going for it is the price. My lunch was $4.95 and came with soup or rice porridge which fell flat in the flavor department. Both my friend and I tried to dress it up with Sriracha, but decided it still didn't work for us. Second out of the kitchen was the Papaya Salad for $7.95. This tasted different than others around the valley which was due to the lime vinaigrette. It was bitter and missing something sweet or spicy to balance it out. Sad because minus the dressing this may have been a winner. Last to arrive was my Panang Curry Chicken. The portion was to my liking and the chicken appeared to be all white meat which usually makes me happy, but with one bite I knew I would never be back. It wasn't so bad that I spit it out, but it was just boring. Nothing should be boring about Curry especially when you order it at the highest heat level. The sauce lacked thickness and spice. It was at a toddler heat level which just pissed me off. This white girl likes it spicy!   The conclusion to this story is just because a restaurant looks good and the RJ raves about it doesn't mean shit. I will gladly spend double the price for authentic Thai then come to this fancy shmanzy crap hole again."}
{"text":"There's no doubt that the food and the prices are great, but the service really needs some work. I want to see this place survive so go check this place out. Just... bring your patience with you because the service is very slow. I've been here for dinner and several times for lunch. My drinks (a coke and a thai iced tea) arrived AFTER my main course. Yes... I waited through my appetizer with no beverage... parched... waving my hand at the waitress.... parrrrched...."}
{"text":"Awesome! I wish this Thai place were in Dallas. Ordered the Pad Kee Mao and it was delicious. Also came with a ton of veggies which was a great bonus as most of the time it is basically noodles and chicken. The service was also incredibly fast."}
{"text":"I wanted to give Galanga a try since it is very close to my place so I decided to go with a friend for dinner.  First, Galanga Thai Eatery is located about 5 minutes south of the strip on Las Vegas Boulevard. They do have some parking spots that they share with the other businesses around it, so it can be difficult to park at times. The place itself is very small so it can also be hard to find seating at times.  One thing that annoyed me is that there is no bathroom inside the restaurant. After asking the staff, I was told to use the one at the car rental place at the other side of the strip mall!  We had the sweet and sour chicken (which came with a bowl of rice), and the Tom Yun shrimp soup and they both tasted good. Service was really good and friendly. Our food also came very fast, so fast that it almost made me a little suspicious...  In conclusion, I would say that this is a quite good place for Asian-American food. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"Galanga is a steady source of Thai food for our family for more than 10 years. The food is of consistent quality. Many of the dishes are hot but not spicy to the limit you cannot taste the food.   I suggest pumpkin curry and the eggplant tofu."}
{"text":"We Yelped and found this place - terrific food and very personable service. So happy we came!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight!! Ordered delivery and was really impressed with the food quality! I got chicken satay, a side of steamed rice, steamed veggies, steamed dumplings, and lychee juice. Nom nom nom. Everything was super tasty but my favorite had to be the steamed dumplings...something about the spicy soy sauce it came with I couldn't stop eating it. Delicious and I will definitely be ordering from here again!!"}
{"text":"Love this little hidden gem. Good service, great food and they have Groupon! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Some of the most disgusting Thai food I have ever eaten. How did this place get good reviews?! How do you mess up Larb? That's pretty much a normal entree in any thai restaurant. That's like, messing up orange chicken at Panda Express. It was pure fish sauce, no spices whatsoever. Then they didn't even follow my directions for the Lad Nah. I wanted it spicy! Not bland!!! The \"gravy\" was so watery it was gross. I was conflicted on the mixed reviews but thought I'd give it a try since this place had enough 4 star reviews. BOY, I was WRONG. did you pay these people to give you good reviews?? I hate you guys. Lol why did I spend money on this crap. YELPERS BEWARE. If you really want to know the difference between real Thai food and this junk... give Weera Thai a try on Sahara Ave. You'll immediately notice the difference on the first bite."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've been here a few times and haven't been disappointed yet.  So far, I've had the pad see ew, chicken larb, calamari & panang curry and it's all been delicious. The service is warm & attentive and they give you an option of how spicy you'd like the food (1-5) so you can order to your liking.  The restaurant is tiny, but the interior is cute and well-decorated so it's perfect for a cozy meal there or some quick takeout.  Will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and incredibly friendly staff. Cozy little restaurant. If I was to recommend a dish it would be the peanut curry with crispy pork and of course you must have sticky rice!"}
{"text":"The ambiance: Modernly decorated with faux deer mounts, distressed mirrors, and cute floral accents -- you'd think that you stepped into your saved pins on Pinterest instead of a Thai eatery. Galanga is so tiny that there's not even have a bathroom, which is the one glaring inconvenience you'll encounter when dining in. (You will have to go about six doors down to a car rental place.)  The service: My bf and I stopped in a little after lunchtime. It was fairly empty, but then other parties started getting seated and the phone started ringing, so the poor lady was spread too thin. Though clearly understaffed, she worked hard to juggle everything and luckily, everyone was understanding.   The food: I got the PAD SEE EW with TOFU... Sorry to say, but it was bad. Biting into the tofu pieces sent water squirting and the sauce was too heavy, almost bitter to the taste. Probably the worst pad see ew I've had. My bf got his usual YELLOW CHICKEN CURRY, which was surprisingly good. I was worried that everything would be horrible given how things were going, but the curry was the saving grace. His only complaint was that there's too many onions and he mistakenly thought they were the potatoes. (The last one is totally his fault.)  Overall, I'd suggest doing doing takeout if you want to try them. If you really want to dine in, then grab the Groupon to save a few bucks."}
{"text":"If they hire some an additional server and another cook, I'll bump my review up to five stars.  The food, especially the variety of curry dishes, is quite tasty and gives you some serious bang for your buck.  When my colleagues and I go here for lunch, the plates are seriously cleaned off.  The issue is the service and the amount of time it takes to eat lunch here.  Let's face it, this food is pretty easy to make, and yet if a group of us wants to do lunch here we need 90 minutes, and that's ridiculous.  It's especially frustrating because this place is minutes from my office, which should make it the perfect lunch spot when you have to be back at work in an hour.  So, very good food and great value, but far too slow...  If you have the time and consider yourself a patient person, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible dining experience! My wife and I had a date night that started at Top Shot in Las Vegas (incredible shooting) & tried Galanga Thai Eatery for the first time. This is our new go to Thai restaurant! We loved it! Keep Winning, Galanga! #winwithron"}
{"text":"Service was friendly, but I thought the food was just ok. I could tell that the dishes were made with care, but the flavors just fell flat.  It is located in a little plaza, with plenty of parking. The decor is minimal and the place is small. No restroom! first restaurant I 've been in Vegas with no restroom, you walk three stores down at the Car Rental place for restroom. I would suggest getting takeout.  Crispy Tilapia: This was a good size fish. It wasn't bad, but a bit bland even with the provided dipping sauce.   Duck noodle soup: my bf thought it was made well. The duck came in shredded and the broth was salty to me but he liked it."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when they were located at von's shopping center. Then they moved to Food4Less shopping cnter, I still like it. The business closed for several months, don't know why. Now they're back and I'm so excited. Today I came back for my favorite, pad thai. It doesn't taste as good and they no longer have lunch special."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food & Got it delivered within less than an hour. It's Vegas, so I didn't expect much from this place, but I was craving Thai food. It's very convenient that they do deliveries! We need more restaurants to deliver."}
{"text":"Good food at a better price. Huge portions! If you're a fan of spicy, ask for a 5/5....because even that isn't too hot"}
{"text":"Ordered Mongolian beef for carryout! ALOT of onions and like 8 small pieces of beef.It lacked flavor. For 7.99 cut back on the peppers and onions.The spring roll they give is a bulk frozen and was mush. When walking in you see 6 or more small tables.No counter but register hidden behind beads coming from ceiling and a drink cooler.As i just finished the food im still hungry!! Smallest amount of food ever!!"}
{"text":"It's a small place south of the airport but the food is excellent. t's my go to place for Thai when in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food made up for the waitress' attitude. The lettuce wraps were really amazing. The food overall was fantastic. It was a cute little place."}
{"text":"I have ordered here for over a couple of years. The food is great. However I am in shock that there located 5 mins from me and it's now been an hour and a half for my order. They said new driver which I understand however I know my food will be cold when it gets here. Last time I'm ordering from here. I have sent a ton of people here. Really disappointed. And am being charged the full amount. Not how to run a business when they know I order here every week."}
{"text":"Had their $9.99 luncheon. I had the Som-Tom (papaya-salad) combo. My wife had the Grilled Pork over Egg Fried Rice.  A bit of info on us: Thai is my favorite cuisine. We've taken several Thai cooking classes in CA and in Thailand. We've been to Thailand at least 4 times (about 35 days total).  The Som-Tom contained too much liquid dressing. In most Thai restaurants the Som-Tom is prepared to order, so they'll ask you for the degree of spiciness. (not here). Their Fried-Rice was overly salty (not just from Nam-Pla (fish sauce) but other condiments.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"This place was okay. the larb wasn't what I expected, it wasn't grounded up like other places and they didn't provide cabbage with it. :-(  The portions were not big for what they charge. I'll stick to Lucki Thai."}
{"text":"love the chicken Pad Thai lunch special. liked old location better but still good food."}
{"text":"The food is tasty!  Found a groupon online and came to have dinner one night at this place and for the price it was definitely a good deal. We ordered a curry and a noodle dish to share. The food was delicious and came out really fast. The portion size is comparable to other Thai places. We also got a Thai iced tea with Yelp check-in! SCORE! The mochi ice cream for dessert was also very good. We were so stuffed after our meal that I couldn't even walk.  Good prices, easy, no frills."}
{"text":"Pad thai (lunch special) and thai tea were good. Good portion too. Small place. Wouldn't mind going again."}
{"text":"We like this place. The prices are good as is the food. When they say hot, it's very very spicy!!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke, we placed an order for lunch at work and were told it would be delivered at 1:25 I'm writing this review at 2:35 and still no food. I'm positive that when and if the food arrives it will most likely be cold and old. 3 times we've been told the driver is 10 minutes away. Horrible customer service"}
{"text":"My philosophy is: the more hidden a Thai/Viet restaurant is in a strip mall or off the beaten path, the better the food. This place once again proves me right. The food is terrific and the service great. Highly recommended for a lunch or early dinner. Very tiny place, no alcohol, but you could still bring a crowd here and have fun."}
{"text":"I lived in the midwest and frequented many a county fair.  Well, when I took my food home and opened it, it smelled like when you would walk into the livestock barns.  No kidding, that exact smell.  Absolutely revolting.  Needless to say it went straight into the garbage."}
{"text":"Come here almost every other Saturday.  Best Thai Food in town. Spicy Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Chow Mein is a must"}
{"text":"These guys made our night, 4 courses for 13.95. The service is just remarkably slow but the guy was really nice. Oh well take the good with the bad. The Curry (yellow) was so freakin good the next day it was even better (the guy forgot to put the rest of my rice in with my left overs). OK there are two glowing blight's on this review yet I am still giving them 5 stars. Why you ask 1. Food is just that good. 2. Food is just that cheap. 3. So maybe you will read this review and eat here because they aren't very busy and I'm afraid they will close. 4. Yelp doesn't have half stars. 5. Oh did I mention super cheap lunch? P.S. BYOB"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic hole in the wall.  I noticed many people indicated that there was no seating inside but there is...very little but it is there.    The food was excellent.  I especially enjoyed the Coconut Milk with Chicken soup. I've never had it with so many wonderful mushrooms and zucchini.  I would highly recommend it.    We will be returning and maybe having them deliver since they do that.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Beef Noodle soup is a must. !!!!! Taro milk was amazing.  Fast and Great service with smile."}
{"text":"Great and literally hole in the wall for good Thai food.  Nice and friendly service... But small dining room.  Satisfied every time I have been there!  Love this place!  Prices very reasonable too.  Serving sizes were perfect."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 starts because I feel bad... Basically mine the worst Thai food of my life. The papaya salad was waaaay too salty with an over load of fish sauce and not balanced flavor wise. I tried adding sugar but it was still too salty. The Thai egg rolls were mushy on the outside which was also disappointing. My Pad See Eww was also too salty and I again tried to add sugar but it still didn't help balance the flavor. I ended up throwing everything away and just making my own masaman at home. So bummed and disappointed since I really wanted to support a small business."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp- but actually it was after we drove to Miko's Izakaya to try their ramen but sadly read on their door that they open at 4:00pm (Open for lunch please!!!!) that we drove across the street and I recognized Galanga from Yelp. The BF is always down for Thai- it's the kid that we had to convince to eat there- thankgoodness they have Yakisoba (that won the kid over).  This place is located right near Von's (the Von's that Flavor Flav frequents) and when you walk inside it seems very clean with the right amount of Thai decor. Against one window are shelves with various Thai canned foods, Thai sauces & Thai pickled items on display- interesting!!!  Now to the food, my daughter right away ordered her plain Yaskisoba with nothing in it just noodles (the waitress seemed very confused by this request...) The BF and I each ordered a lunch special- his was chicken yellow curry and mine was shrimp & veggie stir fry with ginger sauce. My daughter's yakisoba tasted weird but she was happy so I was happy- I just thought the Yakisoba had an unusal aftertaste and not like Japanese Yakisoba at all. The BF's curry was good and my stir fry was O.K. nothing special. My scoop of rice turned me off, it seemed like it came from the bottom of the rice pot- i hate that!!! Both lunch specials came with soup &  one appetizer - I got the egg roll and he chose the cream cheese crab rangoon- both were good but too small.  I don't know how it will be with  the regular dishes but my main complaint is that too little food is given for a lunch special. The food was tasty but we were still hungry leaving this place. The soup that came with our meals was what we thoroughly enjoyed. We did have to send back our Mango and Peach ice teas in exchange for water as they were just too damn sweet - i love sweet- but this sweet was too much. I would come back and try out other items on the menu...."}
{"text":"The food was alright. Had a Pad Thai and it was too salty. The restaurant is extremely small with no bathroom. Was not impressed."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. We will definitely be coming here regularly. Found a Groupon for this and decided to try it out. I ordered a vegetable fried rice and it was delicious. Perfect amount of flavor. Did I mention how amazing their service was. STELLAR"}
{"text":"I love the food and the service provided at Galanga. I come here 2 or 3 times months with my children and every time we go our cravings are satisfied."}
{"text":"The food was not memorable but, getting food poisoning was.  I ordered for five people and three out of five got uber sick.  The one thing we all had in common was the chicken.  If I didn't get food poisoning it would be three stars."}
{"text":"My 1st experience eating here was great - but I decided to wait to leave a review until I had eaten here more times. I've tried several different items on the menu, several different times, and every time the food was amazing! Everything was fresh and had so much great flavor, I ate here 3 days in a row I liked it so much. Every Thai place is unique, and I love when they take a classic item (like lettuce wraps or chow mein) and put their own twist on them. I look forward to eating here again, I'm excited to try more things from the menu!"}
{"text":"We always stop by when we are going through. We're from southern California and we are never disappointed. Wish we could relocate this place to our area."}
{"text":"While staying at the Cancun resort across the street from Galanga Thai, we went over and got take out one night. The food was good. The place only has a few bar stools if you want to eat there. It seemed a little dingy (could use some dusting)."}
{"text":"Im on this Thai kick and couple of friends told me to try this place out because its super close to my place but I guess this place is closed down it says they closed at 10 p.m. But it's 7:11 p.m. and it's close????"}
{"text":"Galanga is a small Thai restaurant, but don't be fooled, they have bomb a** food and they can accommodate special requests ;) this place is ran by a couple, and I just noticed how they were getting orders on the phone and people were coming in and out to get their food. I guess their specialty is take-out, but this is definitely a must-try if you love Thai food!"}
{"text":"The server here was so rude and disrespectful. She doesn't even speak English right or understand it so ordering food and asking for things was a headache.  Its obvious there water isn't properly filtered for their drinks becayse when I ordered Iced tea, it tasted like nothing but straight tap water.     When I asked to change the drink, she gave an attitude.     The food isn't anywhere near good as the other Thai spots. I recommend somewhere else if you want good food and service."}
{"text":"This place is not a place to eat at !! It is very small only good for take out. We got chicken won ton wraps there was no chicken in them !!! We got beef and broccoli barley any meat , it was basically only broccoli. I told the lady can we get more meat in here because there barley was anything and she looked at the other guy and played stupid like she didn't know what I was talking about . The only good this was the chicken fried rice . HORRIBLE PLACE ... Service sucks ..."}
{"text":"The server was so nice but the food was sub par. Not very good. Calamari was bad, and not the good juicy fresh calamari I'm used to, the beef curry tasted like they used old steak and frozen green beans and just boiled it real quick with the curry sauce. I got a Thai chow main that wasn't bad, but wasn't anything to brag about. I hate to be so negative but I would never go back."}
{"text":"The Galangal Thai Eatery is a winner.  The menu is extensive.  Dishes you would expect to see are there, along with many more.  Whether you like pork, chicken, beef, or tofu, it's on the menu.  Vegetarians and vegans have a good choice of dishes, too.  The restaurant is small, but comfortable.  Carry-outs are available.  The service was terrific."}
{"text":"New to the area and been looking for good Thai for over a year. Awesome. Huge menu with all the favorites. Yum."}
{"text":"Came across this place through Groupon. It wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The food was just so-so.   Pad Si Ew was 4/5 stars  the noodles were tender and the dish was seasoned very well. This was the best thing we ate.   Thai Egg Rolls 1/5 stars  it was so mushy in the inside and lacked flavor. The dipping sauce was not my cup of tea, there was so much fish sauce in it.   Basil Beef 3/5 stars  I'm use to having Thai basil beef as ground beef. This dish came as sliced beef and it was good but it did change the texture of the dish and with it being sliced meat there was very little protein.   Thai Tea 3/5 stars (free if you check in)  It was just okay."}
{"text":"Very good. The Pad Kee Mao was excellent.  I loved the eggplant in it.  The Tom Yum soup is also very good.  The flavor on the beef salad was very good.  The only complaint was the beef itself.  I wish it was more rare."}
{"text":"Wow, I guess I can't give an accurate review of the food since everything we received was obviously reheated from last night?? We got the galanga plate, the chicken was rubbery and definitely microwaved. The fried food was all chewy and refried, slightly burnt and stale tasting. My husband ordered the seafood salad and there is no way this is fresh made. Disgusting, you NEVER serve day old seafood salad even if it is lunch time and you made it the night before. Very upset and disgusted. Whatever you do, don't come here for lunch because you will probably be getting last nights leftovers.   UPDATE: We received an apology for our experience and a refund. The food was pretty awful and we ended up throwing out the seafood salad, but I'm always willing to give places a second chance if they try to make it better. We will plan on trying dinner here to see if ordering during busy times helps the quality."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe the amazing service we received here! I have never been to this place, so my girls and I decided to try it out after a long road trip last Friday 05/25/18. The woman working there was just amazing. We received free drinks and extra food to go because she was delighted how we reminded her of her daughter. Let alone, the food was delicious and service was so fast! Thank you! When we are back in town, we will definitely be dining here again!"}
{"text":"Great food. We had the panang curry and spicy fried rice. Both dishes were amazing and fresh. Will come back again when we visit again."}
{"text":"Galanga gives me some mixed feelings, but it won't stop me from eating here. You couldn't ask for friendlier service or more appropriately sized portions when eating Thai food, especially take out. It's convenient to my work and consistently delivers high quality food.   I've eaten from Galanga on a few occasions, always enjoying a form of curry. Panang is my favorite Thai dish and theirs has loads of flavor and tender chicken. Their mango sticky rice is enough to write home about and their coconut rice pudding was delicious. Two stars for food and another for service!   However, there's only a few barstools in this establishment and so eating inside would be uncomfortable and hot. Did I mention hot? Every time I come to pick up my food and end up waiting I begin to sweat. I'm not sure if their air doesn't work properly or they just have a hard time facing directly into the evening sun, but man is it HOT. It's happened three times now over a span of four weeks. In fact I tried to get a soda from the fridges inside and even they weren't cold. Not to mention she had to help me get the slider closed because the doors don't work on these fridges. Mediocre inside decor and the occasionally misquoted wait time added to the mixed feelings and I ended up docking a star. But note: the food alone is amazing. Eat here for that reason only and you'll be impressed!"}
{"text":"Dined in this time. Showed up at 940PM and they close at 1030PM; Ordered our food with haste: Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Pad See Ew w/ Beef, Green Curry Chicken. The appetizer Thai chicken lettuce wraps were the last thing to come out; all the food in general took a while to come out and after having our food for about 5-10 mins, the waitress came over and said time to close I get you a box (it was only 1015pm). Very unprofessional to rush us and box our food when it wasn't your closing time. On top of all that she had brought us the check but it had the prices increased by $2-4/item then what the menu reflected (because we were using a groupon?). I didn't say anything because I just wanted to get out of there.  Additionally when she did box everything up and put it in the bag, she did so poorly and it all spilled out. What a waste.  The food wasn't bad this time, but it wasn't amazing and I will never be back to this place. Just not worth my time, effort or money."}
{"text":"One of our favorites, the food is consistently good and they deliver. We love the Thai Won Ton Soup. The best Won Ton soup I've ever had. The BBQ pork fried rice is delectable. We also enjoy their sweet Thai chili chicken. We haven't ventured their menu too much because we love our favorites but the food is great."}
{"text":"Love this place for the quality and taste of food! Price being reasonable is a bonus.  My husband and I love this place and go there at least twice a week.  Ambiance is very nice too!  Sometimes when this place is swamped, the service can be slow! over all...AWESOME place to go dine and relax!"}
{"text":"Galanga had great reviews on Yelp and was near home so we decided on stoping by for lunch. Very small but cute place. The lady that took our order was super sweet . Food tastes great, we got the Mongolian beef and seafood soup. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Love the pan fried silver noodles. Such a great dish. Always a warm welcome. Overall great Tai food"}
{"text":"this place is as good as it gets ..price and size of meals..I usually always get the mei fun beef and shrimp combo..like 8 bucks..I have tried other plates but there noodles based dishes r the best..I have eaten here over a year and anyone I have taken has said its best in vegas....no grease clean amazing tasting thai food and this Is coming from someone that lives in Chinatown area"}
{"text":"From out of town and needing food quickly, two tables with little plastic stools, a cooler full of drinks and a chipper lady taking orders at the counter, we were cautious but it turned out great.  Cucumber Salad spicy and fishy just like in thailand, pad thai/ fried rice and eggplant something all tasty and spiced to level three.  Portions huge, still warming it up for breakfast 3 days later. Steamed dumplings  delish, roti cannai appetiser more than a meal, not the best ever but good.  tons of food and drink for three peeps $48.00"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food awesome service can't complain!"}
{"text":"great food, killer lunch specials -- the kind of low price that sort of make syou concerned that they might not be open the next time you want to go.  About $6 gets you plenty of food, and everything i've tried so far has been excellent.  Personal fave so far is the pad thai (to be expected) as well as the pot stickers (which i hear are actually steamed dumplings, but tasty none the less)  I would definitely give this place a shot if you're in the mood for Thai!"}
{"text":"Great little place for family and has a great selection of food and highly recommend the mango and sticky rice"}
{"text":"I don't really care about authentic. I probably wouldn't recognize authentic if it slapped me in the face. I'd probably just wonder why some stranger just hit me.  So I don't know if Galanga is authentic. I just know that it's pretty good food at good prices. For less than $6 during lunch time, I can get my Thai curry fix. I've had their Panang and their Massaman; they were both enjoyable. I actually never used to enjoy Galanga all that much. Perhaps they improved with their move?  Yes, this is the same Galanga that was previously down the road in the Vons shopping complex on Windmill and Bermuda. They are now in a smaller location with no tables--there is just a counter along one wall if you want to eat in. For the most part, it looks like they are now concentrating on take out and delivery orders.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I'm so sad that I'm giving this place one star, but it has seriously gone down hill. We typically order from here a few times a month and the last two times it has tasted off. Tonight was the last straw. The noodles were rubbery, the sauce was watery, and the Rangoons tastes like absolute crap. I normally LOVE their sweet and sour sauce but it tasted like syrup. So sad!  Did they change owners or what? Seriously so bummed, but we're never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Terrific food and service!  We came here for the first time tonight. The facade out front doesn't appear special and the interior dining area isn't particularly over-the-top, but their food and service is REALLY VERY GOOD! Our server was a total sweetheart. We ordered five items plus boba tea and all of it was delicious. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I wouldn't get food delivery from HERE again. The bean sprouts in the thai fresh rolls were not fresh, they were brown. The orange chicken was barely orange. Never had I had a restaurant fail at white rice. It tasted as though the water was bad or the rice cooker was too old to still be in use."}
{"text":"Great food. A little different presentation and flavors than most of the Thai restaurants in Vegas that I have been to but excellent. I had the crispy garlic shrimp, yum! Restaurant is very small, holds maybe ten people total and there is no restroom so you have to go next door. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"We got a free Thai Tea for checking in, which was cool and tasty. The food was excellent. The sticky rice and mango dessert was a total win. I would go just for that. We also used a Groupon and the waitress didn't bat an eye at the free Thai Tea for each of us plus the Groupon. She was nice and attentive. Its located in a strip mall and is a super small place, but worth the drive and taking the chance. You won't regret it! I know that I will definitely be back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"The server was super sweet, running around getting anything we were asking for. They had my favorite little enoki mushrooms in the food. I'm so happy."}
{"text":"I have lived around the corner for almost a year and sad I did not try this place until last month. I love the quality of food, quick delivery service, and menu options. My go to dishes are the sweet Thai chili chicken and galanga plate appetizer. I have ventured out of my go to dishes and been pleased every time. The only real knock is the lack of dining room to eat in the restaurant...this place is a take out/delivery establishment. I suggest all in this neighborhood order to go and give galanga  a try."}
{"text":"The reviews for this place is very up and down and the reason I'm thinking is that they hit the mark on certain dishes and just don't on others. That's what happened for me today. I ordered the shrimp tom yum, and YUM it was!! ;) The broth is perfectly sour and spicy. I wish there was a bit more to it, but there's a noodle tom yum I guess I will try next time. 4/5 stars for the tom yum. I also ordered sticky rice and beef larb, which are my absolute favorites as far as Thai food goes. The larb was just ok at first and the more I ate the less I liked it. It tasted like they did not use extra lean ground beef and didn't drain the fat properly, and as a result, the juices were thick with fat. There also wasn't enough lime juice. I was sorely disappointed in the larb.   I'm not writing it off though. I want to go back and try other things before I give it a real judgment call.   Note: The place is TINY. There are 4 total 4-tops with a long picnic table in the middle that seats maybe 6. Luckily that table was open so it was just me at the picnic table, lol."}
{"text":"Food was ok delivery came on time egg rolls were soggy and egg in my pad se ew was very soggy :/"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places for pad Thai. Not overly sweet and saucy like many Thai places I've tried in Las Vegas. My husband lives the BBQ pork."}
{"text":"Dont go here, they dont honor their promotions.  You take the time out of your day to make your way here and they shut you down even after you read the FINE PRINT for their groupon, no where does it say does not apply for holidays, if Fathers Day is even a Holiday?  It is not, that was their exscuse.  Place was dead, another sign place sucks!! Never coming back, n you should not waste your time as well."}
{"text":"Looks like the place is CLOSED DOWN, per the photo someone else shared of their storefront, and the fact that their web site is no more...    But I am posting a quick review just in-case they open up elsewhere.    I'm a big fan of Thai food, especially Mussamun (aka Mussaman) Curry.   I like it really spicy, and constantly try it at different Thai restaurants in the hopes of finding one that is able to both provide the 'heat' that I like, without it overwhelming the other curry flavors.    With that in mind, I tried Galanga in early January, getting a couple items for take-out.   While the Pad Si Ew was OK, it's always the Massaman Curry that I use to judge the place.   I ordered their Massaman Curry with Tofu to be very spicy, and when I got the order home 20 minutes later & sat down to eat it, it was NOT at all similar to the Massaman Curry I've had hundreds of times from dozens of different Thai restaurants all over the country over the years.   Clearly to me, something was WRONG with it.    While every place might do Massaman Curry a little different, it's always had the same basic taste that people expect when they order it, much like if you order apple pie somewhere, it should basically taste like baked apples.    But with Galanga's Massaman Curry, it had a very different & unpleasant taste that permeated the dish.  I thought maybe the tofu had been soaked in pickle juice, or that something had fermented before being cooked.   While I do not know for sure what the problem was, I've thought about it over the weeks & the assumption I've come up with is that because I wanted it very spicy, the idiot at Galanga chose to save time & effort by dumping a bunch of Sriracha sauce into it -- that's exactly what it tasted like.    I'm no chef, let alone a Thai chef, but I don't think Sriracha sauce is a normal ingredient to Mussaman Curry, and based on my many experiences with the curry elsewhere, is certainly not used to provide the heat.     But whatever the case may be, that curry I ordered from Galanga tasted utterly horrible, and I do hope the place is shut-down, but even if not, I'll never go back there."}
{"text":"Spicy Singapore Noodles were above expectations & delish. Pumpkin Curry was outstanding, service was top tier.Their mango sticky rice was fine but I have had better"}
{"text":"I love my San Fran Thai restaurants and this place compares. The Thai tea is amazing!! Def think u should chk this place out if your looking for Thai food."}
{"text":"This was just ok. I ordered togo cause it was on my way home and easy to do on the yelp app. I ordered the basil chicken. Anytime I have EVER ordered this at a Thai restaurant it comes with minced chicken. This restaurant served it with sliced chicken and vegetables. It was ok, just not what I was expecting. The Pad Thai is usually a staple, but it didn't have any peanuts in it or on the side. A little disappointed cause I noticed this after I left the restaurant. If I was in a pinch I'd order again but definitely not my favorite."}
{"text":"I went there today for lunch for two. It was very good. Near smiths blue diamond and LV blvd. It is a little casual place with a server but not too large. Food was ready very quick which is perfect if you are in your lunch break. Very clean and an A rating on the wall. For dinner I will probably do the take out. We had the chicken lettuce wraps, Veggie egg rolls and chicken pad Thai and all were fabulous. Well priced and I will be back there soon. Anxious to try some more of their items."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the quaint atmosphere & friendly service we received at Galanga. I \"discovered\" this Thai eatery thanks to Groupon & Yelp, even though it's in the shopping center of my go-to grocery store, Smiths, on the corner of Windmill (Blue Diamond) & Las Vegas Blvd. Thank you!  The Shrimp Pad Thai (10.99) was very good but a bit moist for my taste. I also missed the cilantro & lime which I like on Pad Thai.  The Galanga Plate (10.99) was a combination plate with 2 each of egg rolls, chicken satay skewers, crispy wontons, potstickers and crab raviolis. Loved it!  I'll return & try a different main dish next time. But I doubt if I'll be able to pass up another chance at the delicious Galanga Platter."}
{"text":"Just ate here, and must say, it was truly what I wanted. Mom n Pop Thai joints always have that feel and taste that other Thai places dont.   Pros: -Great service -Most meals under $10 -Great portions, even my Beef Curry had a steak full of protein!  Cons: -small place, could hear every other conversation in the room lol."}
{"text":"It looks like a hole in the wall, but the Tom Yum is one of the best I've had in a looping time."}
{"text":"I ordered the Thai combination plate for delivery and it was terrible. Not worth $10 at all.   Barely any rice, plain salad, and like 5 rubbery chewy pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"Potstickers, galanga curry mix, pad Thai chicken, vanilla ice cream with sticky rice! Everything tasted amazing, best Thai food ever! All for $12.95 per person! SJ style!"}
{"text":"Liked the quantity of the food they give. Taste is good. 2nd day and visiting 2nd time. Ambience is ok. Small place with 5 tables. But food is good worth coning here."}
{"text":"Good stuff! And they deliver to my work. We were all hungover at work the other day and nothing seemed like it would hit the spot like some good Thai. We are in a new office and weren't sure where was close and would deliver until we found Galanga online. The lady was very patient on the phone as we had a pretty big order. And she repeated the order to a tee including our boss's very strict instruction of absolutely no green bell peppers. Everything was pretty solid! Only thing is that we all love really spicy food and this wasn't very spicy even though we wanted between a 4 and 5 (on a 1-5 scale). The food was extremely flavorful but the heat just wasn't where we wanted it. Maybe we needed to emphasize \"Thai hot\". Still good though and I know we will order again when the craving strikes again."}
{"text":"Great find, delicious Thai food! We decided to also come here because they offered a Groupon and we were definitely not disappointed. Service was absolutely great (the gal who helped us was so sweet) and food came out quickly. We tried the papaya salad (very delicious) and the pad Thai was delicious as well. We also tried their peanut curry with crispy pork...omg YUM. The pork basically melts in your mouth and the extra peanutty-ness adds such a great flavor to the coconut in the curry. MUST TRY!   This will definitely become one of our go to places when we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food is ok... The waitress very nice, but when I have to wait almost 30 min for one pad Thai to go, then the order is wrong.. That is unacceptable.."}
{"text":"One of our fellow yelpers Rickilane had recommended this place to me a while back and I have been meaning to check it out. So the time finally came to do so and the place was empty... Not just saying it had one or two people in it... We walked in and were greeted very quickly and seated.   I was expecting the $13.95 4 course dinner in which Rickilane had mentioned and guess what; not only did they have it, it was $12.95. I went ahead and ordered my food For my appetizer i ordered the Galanga Rolls and the wife ordered the Chicken Satay. For our soup or salad I ordered the spicy chicken soup and she ordered a salad and for the main dish I ordered the amazing Chicken Pad Thai, Rebecca ordered the Beef Pad Thai and for desert we had the sticky sweet rice with ice cream and the coconut rice pudding...   Okay so now that your mouth is watering and you are grabbing your keys to head to Galanga, let me point out the not so mouth watering details..... Unfortunately the service is very very slow we finished the appetizer and sat for a while waiting for our soup and salad and the same thing happened course after course, eat sit wait and then start again. The quality of the food makes up partially for the service and I would love to see this place get a few servers and maybe another cook or something and really bring this place to life.."}
{"text":"The food is not worth eating, I wish I ordered from somewhere else. Appitizer combo is nasty! The Crab ravioli is a joke! Beef jerky is not good, and the pumpkin curry is gross. It's November I thought they would use better pumpkin. It takes weird and it has green skin. The only good thing I ordered was the Thai tea. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Great for take out. We frequent this joint because it's 2 minutes from our house. If you're visiting the strip and staying and a time share off south Las Vegas Blvd, this is a good, quick take out option!"}
{"text":"We were starving and had to go grocery shopping and this was the closest food. The place is being remodeled so the floor was cement & walls bare but we found a place with wonderful Thai food!    Hubby had the War Wonton and I had the Tom Yum Noodle. All I can say is WOW!! Amazing flavor for both. The war wonton had lots of seafood & a lovely mild broth.  The Tom Yum was full of chicken & noodles in a spicy broth. YUM Indeed!!  Two problems-we were so excited I didn't get one photo and we can't decide what to have next time!! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Real Thai food. A simple takeout-oriented, no-frills location with some of the best food in town.    I'm half Thai, and made it a point to take my Thai mother here last time she was in town. She's not stopped talking about the place since - this is genuine Thai food prepared as a Thai person would want it.   Curry meat is slow-simmered as it should be; papaya salad is amazing; pad prik king is the best I've had in town.  Never been disappointed by anything I've ordered.  It is a small and simple location - it used to be takeout only but now a few tables are set up inside so you can eat here. Whether taking out or dining in, though, I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Cute little place run by a couple.  If I could give 3.5 stars I would.  They are getting 4 because it is a family run place.    The wife is in the back cooking and the husband is taking care of front of house.   This place is definitely not fancy and the few tables they have are very close together.   The decor is a bit odd but not off putting.    The food is pretty tasty but there should be more of it on the evening dishes.   My wife ordered the large Tom Yum soup and it came a bowl that I would call medium.  The broth was a bit too salty for both of us but the ingredients were fresh.   The fried tofu appetizer we ordered was delivered hot and was appropriately sized.   I ordered a fried rice dish that was once again tasty but was pretty small portion size for the price charged.     There is nothing wrong with this place, just sort of meh about the experience.   The dining room is sub-par but not horrible.  The service was haphazard but you get the feeling that they care.  The food wasn't bad (other than the salty broth) but you leave feeling that you didn't quite get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Great thai tea. The food is pretty decent. My favorite part though was the awesome customer service. It's hard to find such good service in Vegas."}
{"text":"Establishment does not honor their Yelp Check in deal. I made a lunch order on 5/2/18. Upon picking up my order and showing the host my check in offer for a free Thai tea I was told : oh that's only for dine in. However that's not listed anywhere on the offer. There is not one word saying that it must be a dine in order. Aside from that I paid in cash, the hostess gave me my food and did not give me my change.  Then looked at me like, \"why are you still here\". I said: I need my change please. No way did she deserve a tip so I don't know what she was thinking with keeping my change. I work nearby and have come in a few times (never realizing they had a yelp deal). I've even ordered party trays here in the past. This is the first time I've ever received crappy service. I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, great prices, great food, and I didn't even think I liked Thai food :)"}
{"text":"Just stopped by here today since it was so close and I have to say its not too bad. However the four stars is a combination of their service and their food. Their service was 5 stars, absolutely attentive, polite, quick and everything that good service should be. But their food was 3 stars maybe 3.5. It wasnt bad but it wasnt very memorable either. The coconut soup was okay, a little too much milk and not enough flavor. The pad si ew was okay too but the spice level was just not there for that either. I really liked the place and really wanted more but the food was just okay. But I would go back because their service was that good and because I'm too lazy to drive really far."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR $$$!!  Terrible customers service.  Wouldn't honor a Groupon on a Saturday prior to a Monday holiday even though every other Thai restaurant did.  When we asked for the manager's number, worker claimed she didn't know it and even claimed she didn't know the manager's last name.  Amazing they turned us away considering they didn't have a SINGLE customer in the restaurant!  We had been there before and it was so-so.  We called Ping Pong Thai and they said they would take our Groupon.   Don't waste your time or your money on this place.  There are numerous Thai restaurants so much better than this hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"Food is really tasty and freshly made.  Prices are fair.  Service is not so good: the first time I tried, the waitress did not pay any attention to us (there were only 2 people other than us) and we had to grab napkins ourselves or ask for more water after waiting for 20 minutes.  The second time she was faster but charged my credit card twice for both me and my friend's meal, even though we had specifically told her how to split (on top of that, we went to the counter to pay because she wouldn't show up). That resulted in a charge to my account of $40 bucks and overdraft fee, which luckily I was able to get waived from my cc company.   Overall, I think this place is really good for take out but I wouldn't dine in anymore."}
{"text":"The noodles weren'd bad. Other places are better, but you do get a free thai tea when checking in on Yelp."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for years. They always make my special dish of spam fried rice with pineapple and green pepper.  Great selections."}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting establishment I've ever experienced. Their customer service is beyond abhorrent. I ordered from here and when my food arrived, there was barely any food in the containers and it was freezing cold and soggy! Lettuce wraps were sent to me with a scoop of meat laying on a bed of wet and wilted lettuce. When I phoned them to refund my money and to come pick up their food, they picked it all up and are now not issuing me a refund!!!!!!!! GALANGA THAI EATERY ARE A BUNCH OF CROOKS!!! Never order from here. WHAT A NIGHTMARE!!! I'm reporting them to the Better Business Bureau immediately!!!"}
{"text":"I'm siting at the restaurant as I'm typing this  Best lunch place to eat curry by far."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got the yellow curry with chicken. For $5.50, I really can't complain. The curry was decent, the soup it came with was yummy, the rice was a little too soggy but you cant really tell once mixing it in with the curry. Would definitely come back for lunch if I was working in the area again!"}
{"text":"Wow killer good food, but environment basic. They are improving inside soon. The food is fresh, inexpensive, and great service by Jamie.   No way a 3.5 stars. Only that because of slow deliveries. - but hello, it's fresh cooked food!"}
{"text":"Nnnn.  Naaaas food no so good a bit over priced ok with Groupon order than that no. Presentation of the store is really bad does not look open or welcoming from the outside extra charge for little things even if you use your credit card.. Wake up the next day with bad stomach ake ... Silverware clean but it it can be improve .. Everything can be improved.."}
{"text":"About a 4.5,the only Thai food  I've had that was better ,was in San Fran off of Geary in the 80's,at a place that has long since closed.   Lot's of style and creativity in the dishes (soft shell crab salad is the bomb) and,with the Galanga style curry, makes for a \"check this one\" out if you like well prepared Thai.    One other outstanding thing I've noticed,is the tenderness of the meats is consistently high in all of their dishes. I've been to many Thai places where the pork is  tough,chewy and dry in their curries.   This may be good or bad,but they have no liquor license,so it is BYOB. But the good part is they are in a strip mall next to an Albertson's and you have a good variety of wine and beer to choose from with no corkage fee at the restaurant.  Probably the best Thai I've had in LV."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for a quiet lunch or dinner. The restaurant is very clean and modern feeling inside. The lunch specials are all tasty. The service was good and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Worst fresh roll over. The roll literally had 1 piece of small shrimp.  The shrimp was sliced in half to appear as two pieces. That $5 fresh roll cost about 35 cents to make. It was the most disappointing roll of my life. The only thing that is worth buying here is the curry."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Galanga, and I was really surprised.  The interior is really modern, with some custom lighting, interesting seating, and good ambience.  The lunch special was 4.95, or 5.95 with an additional item.   I got the pot stickers (additional item).  Even though they were not really pot stickers (they were steamed dumplings), they were EXCELLENT, served with a spicy soy sauce that went great.    I then ordered the galanga curry.  It was amazing good.  They don't ask you about the silly number systems that other Thai restaurants use. I hate guessing what the optimum spiciness is at Thai restaurants.  I am not a cook, you tell me! The waitress asked if I minded a bit of spiciness, and I said that it was expected.  This resulted in a perfectly spiced curry.  There were delicious, fresh Chinese eggplant in the curry, and the sauce was good enough to drink.  I know it was only one meal, but this may unseat Pin Kaow as my new favorite Thai place, especially when you consider the price of lunch!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible but at least edible. Would I come back to this place to eat? - No The service was ok, she was nice, but did not really follow up.  Almost everything we ordered, there was something wrong with it.  The beef jerky was hard. The roti was super oily, the curry dipping sauce was ok though, and my kids really liked it. Calamari was horrible- although edible- maybe we were just really hungry... this \"Golden Calamari\" was really disappointing though, there was uncooked flour in the batter, it seemed like they just mixed a bunch of flour with water real quick for the coating, it was lumpy and had no flavor.  Nothing really stood out with this place, at best food was bearable, I definitely can't recommend this place nor will I come back."}
{"text":"Excellent Excellent Excellent. My only regret is going here on my first night in town.  Now my dinner decisions will be really tough for the rest of the week: try somewhere new? Or go back for more curry dishes at Galanga?"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I love the chicken curry (the pumpkin is my favorite) I've tried a lot of their dishes but it is so delicious!"}
