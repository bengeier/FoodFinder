{"text":"This place is recommend to anyone who enjoys an intimate and BYOB dinning experience. It's nothing fancy but rather a local and casual place to eat. The sushi is fresh and great! Everytime we go, I get the Volcano roll! Sometimes the chef even lights it on fire!!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Did not come out hot. Server was rough and not friendly. Would not visit them again."}
{"text":"Sushi don't come  after 40mins waiting while there's only three table at a time.  Really disappointing, the food quality, it is not as good as other sushi bar. Especially the noodle on the menu, those are the instant noodles which cost less than $ 1, and sold for 13.99. Experience is really bad. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Best sushi I had in a long time. They have great prices and it's delicious ! They have hibachi lunch specials for $10!"}
{"text":"You'd be hard pressed to find anything better on this side of town. Family owned and operated(I believe) they allow you to BYOB and there isn't a corkage fee. Take away is fast and easy."}
{"text":"We went to Kasai last night for my birthday dinner and it was awesome! We made a reservation, and while the place wasn't too crowded they gave us a table in the back room, which was really nice. Our server Siobhan (I hope I spelled her name right!) Was very kind and friendly. We ordered a bunch of rolls- Penguin roll, spicy octopus roll, Kasai roll, Top Secret roll, eel roll, Tiger roll and Crazy roll. The portions were perfect and everything was super fresh and delicious. I have already recommended Kasai to the other sushi lovers I know and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine was there a few days ago to order take out. After she placed her order, she witnessed a sushi chef drop a whole tray of fish and open containers of rice/veggies on the floor and in the nearby trash can. He went into the kitchen and returned empty handed. He then began to pick the fish off of the floor, rinsing it in the sink and not throwing it away. He also then began to dig through the trash can. She immediately cancelled her order. She also frequents Kasai often and has vowed to never go again. If they'd do that right in front of you, who knows what they do when no one is watching. I'll never eat there again, either, and I'm thankful she passed along the info."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh. Fast and friendly service.. The spicy tuna and California rolls were perfect."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service, friendly, affordable, no fee on byob.   Music is fun.   Clean, nice atmosphere.   This place kicks butt!"}
{"text":"A lot of nice restaurants have opened in Carnegie in the last couple of years.  We have been coming to Kasai on a regular basis since they opened.  My wife and I have come by ourselves and with large groups.  We have always enjoyed ourselves.  The sushi is great and the service is very friendly.  The friendly people who work there are one of the reasons we keep coming back.  If you are not fan of sushi then the hibachi dishes are a great alternative.   Kasai is BYOB without a corkage fee.  If you want to really get a feel of Carnegie then pick up a bottle of mead at Apis Meadery right down the street to substitute for white wine.  Kasai is definitely worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"When this place was brand new, I was so excited to try it out.  It's very local to my office, sushi is my favorite, and I love giving my money to small businesses vs. large chains.  The first two times I went, the service was a little slow...attributed to being new, I'm sure of it...but the sushi was fabulous!  And the ginger salad dressing is the best I've ever had.  Not that sweet creamy stuff that I despise.  That said, I was eager to return today for more delicious sushi!
Today, however, was NOTHING like my previous visits.  The waitress brought soup for my friend and then....nothing.  We had to ask her to get our drinks and also my salad...she forgot.  Ok, it was busy before we came in, she's just gathering herself....no problem.  I ordered my usual shrimp tempura roll add cucumber with eel sauce and sriracha on the side. The sushi chef gives me one side of eel sauce, sriracha, and spicy mayo ALL MIXED TOGETHER.  I told the waitress that I can't eat mayo, it makes me very sick and can I please have the eel sauce and sriracha in their own small containers.  She does this.  Then I got my roll.....without cucumber.  UGH.  She gives me a side of cucumber that I fumble with to eat on top.  Crisis averted.  Then I bit into the roll....this is where it gets weird.  So, usually the shrimp tempura roll is one shrimp stretched straight and deep fried.  This was not that.  This was a MASS of BABY SHRIMP that was deep fried and put in the middle.  Now, I wouldn't have cared if it tasted the same.  But it didn't.  Have you ever over cooked those baby shrimp?  They turn into chewy hard pieces of rubber.  Well, that's what this was.  Chewy hard rubbery meat with too much greasy batter.  So, I speak with the manager.  I ask him if there was a change to this roll lately.  He says to me \"No.  We typically use the one piece of long shrimp, not the baby shrimps.  I don't know why the chef did that.  I will speak with him.\"  I told him it was not good and I could not eat it.  He apologized and walked away.  I got my bill.  The (uneaten) roll was still on it.  I spoke with him and told him that I didn't eat it, it was not good.  He said that the most he could do is discount the check 10%.  Here's my problem....I said to him....I have no issues paying for anything at all.  But this is a customer satisfaction issue and it wasn't even edible.  I would gladly pay for the cali roll I took to go and my salad, but I don't understand paying for 90% of a roll that I didn't eat.  He said \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience\"....but that is all.  10%....which totaled about $1.60.
I'm not sure what planet this guy was from.  He TOLD ME that it was made wrong.  AGREED.  Then STILL CHARGED ME FOR IT. 
So, I won't be back.  That's a shame because it was so convenient.
Let me say also that had the manager said, \"I'm sorry your food was wrong and inedible.  I took that $6.25 roll off your check and I hope you will give us another chance to get it right in the future\".  I would have said, no problem....things like this happen. And then I would have been back over and over.
It's sad that a manager with no customer service skills killed this place for me.  Oh, and I'm in Human Resources for my company with 135 coworkers.

I sure hope this place gets their act together.  $6.25 was a small price to pay to get many return visits. Horrible business decision on their part."}
{"text":"Sushi was great.  Service was great too. One girl was doing everything (waiting on all tables and ringing guest checks). I give her a lot of credit. The man who made the sushi was nice too. We will be back. It's a nice local place for us."}
{"text":"Sushi is one of those hit or miss things. This place is a hit. It's tucked away but worth it. As others have stated no corkage fee for items you've brought from home. The menu has a great selection of items and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"So great! Food is always delicious, service is outstanding, authentic welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had a pretty good experience here tonight! It's byob, great service and friendly staff. We got some nigiri sushi(maguro and sake) and 3 rolls. 
The futomaki roll was big, rainbow roll was delicious, and really liked the Alaskan roll too! Also, the house salad dressing was great! Really enjoyed the salad, too. 
It was a bit pricy ( green tea was $2.99!) but it's hard to find a decent sushi spot in Pittsburgh, so we will definitely come back to try other things!"}
{"text":"The last time we were here was on a Saturday in March, 2016.  The restaurant was dead and the service was very, very slow.  We were nearly late for our stage call.  Plus, they were out of a lot of stuff.  The food wasn't nearly as good as it had been in the past.  It looked like a gasping business on the verge of extinction.

Hopefully, things have improved, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband I went to Kasai Restaurant again.  This was our second time and we certainly plan on going at least once a week or more.  Prices are really good and the quality of the food is excellent.  Had shrimp and steak and it was the best.  The sushi chef, Terry Is the best he sent samples of different fish and vegetables along with a squid salad to our table to sample.  The waitress, Michelle and host Joanne are the best.  They are really nice and make you feel really comfortable there.  Michelle even taught us how to use chop sticks correctly.  The dining there is really enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is a great place. My girlfriend and I went there last night for dinner. The sushi Rolla were amazing and the hibachi chicken was awesome. Great service and place. We will be back"}
{"text":"Very good sushi, especially for the area.  We had 4 different maki rolls, all of which were excellent.  The fish tasted very fresh and there is a good variety of selection.  Staff was attentive, though not the most professional.  They stood at the sushi bar the entire time we were there and gossiped very loudly.  Because of the great sushi I would gladly go again."}
{"text":"Easy to find, plenty of parking. I was disappointed they were out of hamachi Kama. Everything I ordered was delicious  and very  fresh. The portions are quite large and the prices are reasonable. I would return and recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with my fianc√© on a slow Monday. We were the only ones there so it was nice and quiet. We decided to split three different rolls and they were all delicious. The presentation was great and I loved how the sauces added a new layer of flavor. My favorite was the yellowtail roll; it was wrapped in scallions and added a great crunch to the rice. 

We tried to order some green tea mochi but they were out. Still, the food was great and our service was fast. I'll probably be back in a couple weeks. 

Oh I almost forgot, Kasai is right under a pok√© stop in Pokemon Go!"}
{"text":"YUMMY! Fresh sushi! Good rolls. Wish there were more in the raw department; maybe a few too many fried/cooked sushi roll options for my taste. Just hope they expand the menu a bit.

Another great addition to Carnegie!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food has always been very good. Very good sushi at a decent price.  Had the steak and shrimp hibachi one night as well and that was also very good."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Sushi and this is not bad.  The atmosphere was the kicker.  The server was better suited for a truck stop.  She was quite nice and was really trying hard to please, but lot's of honey's and yelling across the room to see if you needed anything.  Weird for an Asian place.  Better choices in the city, but if you are in the area and don't want to fight traffic, it suits the bill."}
{"text":"I had a chance to eat at Kasai for the first time recently, and I'm so pleased with Carnegie's little sushi bar! Cozy, quiet, and cute, Kasai offers the best balance of affordable and quality sushi that I've come across recently.

My boyfriend and I sampled and shared the Crunch Munch Roll (Spicy crab, topped with tempura crunch, shrimp, and eel sauce), the Spider roll (soft shell crab), and one of the spicier rolls (this was mostly eaten by my boyfriend). Yum! The Crunch Munch was just delectable, and the Spider roll was the best I've come across since one of my favorite places closed a couple of years ago. Everything was fresh and the meal was nothing short of delightful.

The excellent and quick service was the cherry on top of a delicious meal - we were checked on often and were never left wanting during the night. I'm definitely look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"Kasai is my go to sushi place when i am in pittsburgh. The prices can't be beat. The sushi is soild-good. I have eaten at most of the sushi places in pittsburgh, and have settled on kasai as my favorite (quality, price, atmosphere). The owner is super friendly, and is often giving out free sides and such.   I believe he has a passion for cooking."}
{"text":"I searched long and hard to find a good sushi place in Pittsburgh and finally found it the day I left. This place was great, they were fast, clean and welcoming! Jeff was very kind to me and we had a nice chat while I ate by myself. Thank you for having great sushi that would fit in anywhere in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"AMAZING sushi! I got the Kasai and Volcano rolls and it was seriously the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh! Better than Nakama and Benihana! I wish they had hibachi, that's the only downside! So glad I've found this gem! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm always down to try out different sushi spots. A hankering for the yummy stuff led me here. 

Parking in this area of town is fairly easy with a good mix of street and lot parking spaces.  It's outside of the city limits offering a nice break from the crowds. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the hostess from the counter who directed us to choose any seat we wanted. There are specials listed at the door along with some featured items on the wall behind the counter. Be sure to check that out.

The menu has decent mix of sushi (cooked and raw) and entrees. We settled in the Pennsylvania roll which has shrimp, cream cheese and avocado. It was tasty but would've been better if the shrimp were crunchy. They were soft which  didn't offer a good texture balance between ingredients. The yakisoba included mixed veggies and beef but there were very few noodles. Should I even complain about this? Lol it was very good nonetheless. The yakisoba comes out sizzling on a hot plate too. The flavors were perfect...that yummy slightly sweet and salty savory mix that only comes from a bit of teriyaki. It was good and the food tasted fresh. 

We sat in the front section of the restaurant and I overheard that the back doesn't have air conditioning. You may want to keep that im mind as many patrons were switching tables, moving to the front due to the warm temps back there. The dining area is somewhat small and the seats are not comfortable. Rest assured, you'll be distracted from the butt hurt once your food arrives. Lol

Everyone was extremely friendly from the waitress to the sushi dude. We were greeted and they also urged us to come back upon leaving. It's a sure thing...we'll be back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Pittsburgh! They have great hibachi too (it was unavailable for a while). The staff is very friendly. I go here regularly and it's definitely one of my favorite places in the area."}
{"text":"So good! If you're close worth it! Great sushi, you can tell its fresh when terry is cleaning them whole in front of you!

We will be back, fresh and affordable!"}
{"text":"Sushi is great I ordered takeout reasonable portions. Parking can be a challenge during lunch time"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp when I wanted sushi for lunch. When I asked Terry, the sushi chef, what he recommended, he asked me what I liked. I told him I like everything. So he made a 'Terry Special' ($10). It was a giant california dressed with spice dressed salmon, tuna, and yellow tail. Absolutely AMAZING. There was so much I couldn't finish it.

He also gave me an eel, crab, and cucumber salad to start with. I don't think you can beat that value for $10.

As I was leaving, Terry also snuck me a few bites of another roll he was making. Very friendly wait staff. I plan on going back!"}
{"text":"Very good, stopped in for lunch with some colleagues, we were all very impressed!
Had Nigri and a sushi roll,"}
{"text":"I work in Carnegie and passed this joint on a regular basis, so I decided to get some takeout. I sat down around 12:30, ordered the Udon - a relatively simple dish with noodles and veggies.... they didn't have it ready until 1:15."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great prices, and a nice atmosphere. I've tried sushi rolls, hibachi dishes, and spicy noodles and would recommend all of them! The sushi is presented beautifully and the rolls are stuffed. The hibachi is a great value - salad & soup with your entree. The hibachi meats are great, and I believe they all come with a serving of their amazing fried rice. Spicy noodles have a SUPER generous portion of meat & other veggies, in a delicious sauce with perfectly cooked noodles. The miso soup is sometimes a bit too salty for my taste, but still a good flavor. I would love to try their desserts sometime, although so far whenever I have asked about them, it appears they aren't available :(. One day, Kasai, one day."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time, and I wish that I had been going here all along.  Good rolls, good sauces, good service.   It's a smaller place which was good since they said the second server called off sick.  The woman that was there kept up, even as the place started filling up.  She did great.   There were plenty of choices and rolls and the ones we got tasted fresh and were beautiful. They were also good sized pieces, not huge they they could fit in your mouth and not so tiny that you can hardly see the fish.   It is byob so we are looking forward to going back and bringing a bottle or two!"}
{"text":"Everything was Delicious! Staff was minimal, but they weren't busy at all, and very friendly! We shared the steak & chicken hibachi (they make the hibachi in the back, not at your table) and then the tempura asparagus roll & the volcano roll!"}
{"text":"They've renamed most of the rolls here and made their own spin on them. I can see how this is a local favorite. It's close, the prices are decent, portions are good size and the service is good. But if you've ever been to a sushi restaurant in a big city, this place will make you sad. The food isn't super fresh. I ordered a roll with shrimp but it had both crab and shrimp in it when it came out? Maybe there wasn't enough to make it all shrimp? Either way- the crab wasn't fresh, it tasted \"fishy\". And the seaweed was the same. It was so old you couldn't even chew it. I appreciate the neighborhood love for this place but a visitor might find themselves disappointed."}
{"text":"Over priced, black dotted avocado, long wait, messy roll, small soup, two forks no spoon. Never going back"}
{"text":"I'm only giving them 1 star because it is required to be able to leave a review. My boyfriend and I aren't from here and stopped in on a whim. WORST service I have ever had at a restaurant. We waited 20 minutes and left because the waitress never came to take our order. She even waited on a table that walked in after us. My boyfriend and I both work in the restaurant business and this was 100% unacceptable service. 0/10 would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars i would.  Got here at 7:26 and didn't get any type of service until after 8 pm and only bc I had to approach the bar to ask.  It is now 9:05 and just got our sushi and waitress verbally assaulted me and told me to come at a less busy time yet we were th SECOND party in this dump and all other parties that got here after us got service, their meal and already gone.  Manager hasn't talked to us hence requesting it and sushi chef has completed the orders for everyone else and told us our order was too big, we are a table of 5 and each other 1 or 2 rolls.  This place sucks, the waitress is either drunk or high and can't put one foot in front of the other to save herself.  Then she had to nerve to ask me what I did for my job, as if that has anything to do with her crap service and favoritism towards regulars.  I think the Allegheny health office needs to make a stop here.  I will never visit thus restaurant again, it is a despicable establishment that needs shut down."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place four stars because my sushi came right out it would get five if my fianc√©'s food did not take forever and a day the first waitress that came to our table did not speak very good English which is fine the next one came and was prompt and took our orders very fast the sushi came really fast my fianc√© had to get up and go ask again for the sirachi  sauce and spicy mayo otherwise the food was cooked perfect but his Bento box was delicious I wish I had ordered my own the service was prompt and we were checked on consistently my glass of water was never empty I also bought the sushi tasted very fresh they had what looked like really cool sushi boat. 

The bento box was really good and the steak was cooked perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Local sushi place in the heart of Carnegie, truly wonderful- everything is priced reasonably and the staff and owner (sushi chef) is very gracious. He provided our table with a complimentary array of seafood salads. 

The restaurant is very clean and simple. Nothing too snazzy but a nice and simple dining room. 

Where you sit is very important, I recommend (if you like food and aren't trying to be too intimate) to sit at the sushi bar and converse with the chef- he's a really nice guy and will give you samples of random things he making! 

As far as the sushi goes- its some of the best I have had in the area. Tastes very fresh and the rolls are very exquisite, they really do a good job. My favorite rolls are the crunch munch roll and crazy roll. The kasai roll and their raw rolls are plenty good as well.

Good food and service, I highly recommend anyone to stop by this spot and give it a try."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Pittsburgh!  The owner is so incredibly nice. Come here every week for sushi. I have had sushi everywhere else, Nakama, Saga, Little Tokyo, etc and this place is by far the best. You can taste the freshness.  Highly recommend if you're a sushi connoisseur!"}
{"text":"Let me be clear. I'm a snob. The worst kind. But I love Kasai. It is high level stuff. The edamame is excellent. Gyoza perfect. And the spicy chicken habatchi is out of this world. On the second trip I tried a spicy tuna roll. The sauces were very good. The ginger dressing on the salad is too gingery for me but overall I love this place. Ask for Cici. Best server in the world. I have been there three times in a week. I just love this place."}
{"text":"I have frequent here a couple times and I've always had a pleasant experience every time. I enjoyed their sushi and fried dumplings! It's nice to see there are a variety of different sushi orders rather than your typical California rolls that's offered elsewhere. Very clean and traditional decorative restaurant. The staff are friendly and sociable folks, it's really great to have such mannerisms with their customers. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"This is not an authentic Sushi place. You have to pay for Miso soup and it's not Miso. Comes with something like bread noodles- not Tofu.
Frankly, I was embarrassed for myself that I had chosen it.
Especially after I got a free Japanese pancake, because they were out of green tea ice cream.
It had mixed reviews, but I decided to try it anyways.
Unfortunately the reviews were right."}
{"text":"This is some pretty awesome sushi with a spectatular, customer friendly owner/staff.  The sushi chef \"Terry\" is quite entertaining, quite stupendous at his job.  We have been there a few times, bring our bottle of wine (no corkage fee) and simply enjoy the food and company.  The cucumber crab salad is amazing. Their \"pink\" sauce for the fried rice is better than most at the other restaurants. All the sushi we had was ultra fresh and delicious.  It is a bit too bright/cafeteria like in there but with the lights dimmed, the atmosphere is totally perfect!!  Carnegie is really stepping it up with an addition like this. We will be going back and back and bringing new friends everytime!!"}
{"text":"The staff was lovely. The sushi was fresh and very delicious. We ordered a Spicy Tuna Roll, Salmon Roll, Rainbow Roll & Chicago Roll. All very delicious. Pricing wasn't too bad. I think we found a little gem. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"A quaint little sushi place with reasonable prices and quick service. Small, cozy feel with a bar and small tables in main dining area. Menu is mainly sushi with some salads. Typical soft drinks or BYOB. 

Pros: large menu of sushi items, friendly staff & regulars, decent prices, nice atmosphere, easy parking.

Cons: A la Carte can get pricey, but can build a nice meal for $15 or less, menu can be overwhelming for those new to sushi"}
{"text":"After ordering from Kasai yesterday and reading other reviews, I've decided to update mine from last year to be a little more accurately descriptive of my recent experiences here. It's always disappointing to see a restaurant you've enjoyed trip up a bit with quality and service, but I think it's important to know as a paying customer.

A few weeks ago, I called to order some sushi and was told the sushi chef was ill and was off work to recover, which of course is no big deal. Yesterday, my boyfriend and I left work early and I figured I'd order some sushi on my way home. When I first called to place my pickup order, the woman that answered seemed extremely frazzled. I ordered at 1:16PM after being on hold twice and was told it would be about 20 minutes, which is relatively standard for a takeout sushi order (usually anywhere from 10-20 minutes depending on business). We arrived right around 1:30 and my boyfriend went in to grab my sushi. I grew tired of waiting, and walked into the restaurant at about 1:45 to see what was going on. You'd think it was extremely busy if your takeout order is 10 minutes late and you're still waiting, but there were only a couple people in the restaurant including my boyfriend who was also patiently waiting for my sushi and sipping a glass of water.

As I waited at the bar trying to see what the issue was, the server appeared way more flustered than she should be with less than 5 customers including the two of us in the restaurant. My boyfriend told me that prior to me walking in, the woman was speaking audibly about the man at the bar (I guess he was friends with the owner) and how attractive she found him even though she had a boyfriend and that he made her very nervous. I stood at the bar area slightly confused and she had told me she was a few minutes late passing along my order to the sushi chef and also that he had cut himself and was working a bit more slowly. That's a hair unprofessional if you ask me. Even if the restaurant was packed to the max, the sushi chef is literally a few steps away in the kitchen and there is no excuse for as poor of service that she provided.

I finally got my sushi and wasn't expecting compensation for the 45 minutes it took to get 3 rolls, but a sincere apology for the inconvenience would be nice. Other reviews mention a flustered, slow-servicing server and I'd be willing to bet it was the same woman that was there yesterday. Today's order included a Philly roll (always a Philly roll), a tuna roll, and a rock n' roll. I'm not so sure my order was right, but I ate it anyways. The tuna roll was drenched in 2 sauces and a mound of spicy tuna (good thing I'm ok with spicy foods), the Philly roll was ok, and I'm not 100% sure the third roll was a rock n' roll. It was fried as the menu described, but it was so loosely rolled and sloppy that only a few pieces stayed together as I was eating them. It also seemed like there was cream cheese inside, which the rock n' roll doesn't have. There were 2 sauces on this roll as well and they were heavy so it was a bit hard to tell what I was eating.

To put it kindly, I'm let down about what I've seen from Kasai in comparison to the good experiences I've had here before. There's no excuse for treating your customers like they aren't a priority and it has clearly been an issue other customers have experienced, too. Hopefully something changes, because I feel like this place has great potential if they get it together."}
{"text":"Kasai is a very good sushi restaurant. A great addition to Carnegie. Fast and friendly service. It has some very great and delicious sushi rolls. I recommend that you order a roll at a time. Each roll I had was very delicious and well worth the value. 
Prices are about average and the atmosphere is fantastic. Keep up the great work Kasai."}
{"text":"Some of the better sushi I have had in Pittsburgh.  I could eat here once a week. And in Carnegie,  so it is never crazy packed for lunch!"}
{"text":"The food itself was delicious! I ordered the regular tuna roll and enjoyed it. It was a great price for the quality of fish. Some of the more expensive rolls have greater quantities, so if you're looking for something more filling, I'd be sure to ask the waitress or waiter. There are a lot of regulars who swing by to order, and the environment was a little hectic despite it not being too busy. The waitress seemed flustered at times when more people would come in and waited until we had our checks to refill our drinks. When she did refill our water, it was lukewarm. However, despite those little things, everyone was friendly and the food was good, especially for the price we paid."}
{"text":"I was unfortunately disappointed with my recent lunch visit to Kasai. I had high hopes after reading reviews. 

While I actually did enjoy the sushi (rainbow roll, avocado roll and spicy tuna) that I tried, the service was not very good and ruined the experience and the atmosphere. It is true that our waitress was the only server there at the time we were there from 13-115pm, however, there were only 3 tables to wait on during that time. The server was slow to take our order, did not get the quantity of our salads/soups right and openly complained to us about being busy and about not getting enough tips. She and the sushi chef also proceeded to have a minor disagreement in front of us and the other customers. I thought this service was unprofessional. 

The restaurant was clean but the AC was so low where we were sitting that it was uncomfortable. Approx 7 tables inside with what appeared to be a larger room in the back perhaps utilized for dinner. I would be willing to give Kasai another chance but might try dinner instead with the hope that they would be better staffed to handle the customers."}
{"text":"Found this place while on our way to PIT airport. Great selections of sushi and habachi items. Chef is very funny and nice guy. Please gets crowed during lunch time. we all left full and price is reasonable. Service is good too. We will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Service was lacking, though my fiance liked it. They brought her sushi order out 20 minutes before my bento lunch box so she was done with hers as I just waited. Some tables got what I assume was complimentary misou soup and ginger salad which we were never offered. The steak lunch box was ok, the steak itself was good the rest was mehhhh, her rainbow roll was decent but the rice was a little off. Trust me I would eat sushi everyday of my life if I could, this was no where near a 4.5 star yelp restaurant."}
{"text":"So nice to have a sushi in an intimate setting, close to home with such a great quality. I am now a regular here."}
{"text":"Wow is all I have to say. This was hands done some of the worst service I have ever had. We ordered an assortment of different items from the menu, both hibachi and sushi. Our server was beyond overwhelmed. She just kept telling us how she's not used to being this busy. There were 3 tables (13 people) in the entire place!!!!! After 40 minutes we finally got our salads, one missing of course. Then a few minutes later we got our soup. Not learning from the miscount on the salads, we were again shorted a serving. Don't worry though, we quickly forgot about the missing food as the sushi chef and our server began getting into a verbal altercation right in the dining room. 

Once they calmed down, our attention was quickly changed again to the ding of a microwave and the remarkable sudden appearance of our \"freshly\" made hibachi entrees. The food was ok. Wasn't terrible, but definitely wouldn't be something I would stop for again. Halfway through our entrees our sushi appetizers finally arrived, missing some of course. My wife politely told our server hers was missing. The server told her \"I'll have to check honey, I don't keep the checks up my butt.\" 

She finally reappeared with my wife's food. I asked her if we could just have our checks as our quick lunch was at this point pushing the 90 minute mark. She proceeded to tell us how she would get them as soon as she could, but was really busy and she only makes $15 on her morning shifts anyways!!!! I told her that's too bad but really needed our checks.  She then went over to the bar area and placed a phone call to what sounded like her significant other!!! They were talking about personal finances and what they were going to have for dinner that night!

This was by far the worst service experience I have ever seen! And I work retail for a living!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Last minute decision to try this place for lunch today and we were not disappointed! The food was delicious, large portions and extremely fair priced. Not to mention that the service was great and the staff were all very friendly. Would definitely recommend trying."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi in the South Hills. Super fresh and flavorful. It's a tiny little place in Carnegie. It's fast and casual. The only con is they don't do takeout! 
Terry the sushi chef is so good and always brings out a free app!"}
{"text":"Another good new restaurant in Carnegie.  

Friendly and good service.  Kasai was busy.  Had some good Sushi that is reasonably priced. 
It is a smaller restaurant. There are about 8 tables and 10 places at the Sushi Bar.

{"text":"New to the area, my husband and I have already hit the highest rated sushi places in Pittsburgh. And while many were good, this BY FAR is the very BEST we have had!

Newly opened, the restaurant is a good space. The front room looks small, but there's another dining area in the back. It was quiet when we came--a Monday night before the dinner rush. We were seated, given water and menus, and had our order taken fairly quickly. Miso soup came out right away.

We ordered the spicy tuna roll, the yellow tail roll and the hibachi chicken entree. Both rolls came out together and let me say: the fish is incredibly fresh! The sushi was absolutely delicious. We were so happy with it, we wanted to order more rolls just to take home with us. Luckily we didn't, because we ate the entire hibachi chicken entree. Cleaned the plate, it was so good. The staff was friendly, and the owner came around and asked us, and all the other diners, how our dinner was.

At the end of the meal, the owner brought us our check and gave us each a Hello Kitty chocolate marshmallow. It might sound odd to mention it, but to us, it was a sign that the owner really cared about his customers. He wanted to make a lasting good impression. Well, he did. We plan on returning frequently."}
{"text":"Best and most affordable sushi in Pittsburgh.  Extremely diverse menu with something for everyone. Sashimi is unequaled in freshness and flavor. If you venture in, treat yourself to the squid salad, possible the best you'll ever have. When the owner is preparing the sushi you can count on the perfect presentation, taste, and service. Give it a try sushi fanatics...you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Kasai is a tiny little sushi place on the main street in downtown Carnegie.  I have driven past the place a thousand times but never stopped.  So I decided to give the place a try.  They only serve sushi, the menu had a note explaining that hibachi was not available.  We ordered some gyoza, a variety of nigiri and 4 rolls.  The service was quick and there were no issues.  The fish was fresh and on par with most sushi places in the city.  After the meal they gave us some red bean pancakes and a handful of delicious hello kitty chocolate filled marshmallow treats.  Overall I would say this place is a definite try.  Parking is free and right across the street, the food is good and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Stopped over here for lunch to try something new. Practically the whole front page of their menu is sushi but you are not limited to that. The left side shows the raw version and the right side shows the cooked version and will indicate whether or not it is spicy.

On the back of the menu are other offerings including entrees. I was delighted to find that I could have these same entrees for lunch. I opted for the vegetable hibatchi grill which includes fried rice, miso soup, and a side salad with ginger dressing. In addition I got a small plate of noodles with various dumplings on top among which were beef and shrimp.

The place is small and if you sit at the counter you can talk with the chef and see the various sushis in the counter. I sat at a table and was served the miso soup first. It was very good and then came the dumplings with noodles. These were especially good. The salad came next which is nothing out of the ordinary except it has a nice ginger dressing on top.

When I got my main course I was pleased with the fact that they give you a good share of vegetables to equal the amount of rice. Most Asian places load you up on rice and don't give you enough of your entree. Not here. Portion size was just right and very good. Please note that this entree can be ordered with beef or chicken for a slight upcharge.

Needless to say it was a hearty and delicious lunch and was amazed that I got all that food for under $10.00. My waitress was very attentive to my needs and helped explained things to me. Next visit I will most definitely try the sushi. Kasai is located in the central business district of Carnegie and pay meter parking is available on the street or in a private central lot. It is best to come during the week if possible during the day since it was not too busy and easy to get seated.

So whether or not you order sushi I'm sure you will be pleased with Kasai. Take out is available and if you have the Eat 24 app you can use that to order out from this place."}
{"text":"Kasai! Fantastic service,friendly ,helpful wait staff,great sushi. The owner and sushi maker was fabulous, great personality. My niece had the sushi boat featured above, what a beautiful presentation. I have been in the food industry for 35 plus and I think this restaurant is exceptional. I am sorry I did not get the server name , she was exemplary! Took Tim's advise(previous review) and went to Apis meadary and got the raspberry mead. No corkage fee. I got the steak and scallop hibachi ,wonderful! But did try some of the sushi and liked it , I may be a convert! The owner put spices fish eggs on top, oh my, yummy! Crunchy with a little wasabi kick,ever so slight. Owner also sent over spicey salmon salad , I can't think of any more great  comments to say but go and eat at Kasai great food, great prices , great atmosphere."}
{"text":"UPDATE: $5 corkage fee now per table. Didn't seem like it was per bottle from what I understand. Good sushi too."}
{"text":"First time visiting Kasai tonight, hibachi was not available but I was there for sushi and BYOB. I started with the miso soup which was really flavorful and had a lot of soy pieces, maybe a few too many onions for my taste. We ordered three rolls, the Arizona, Rock and roll, and one other that had shrimp tempura with fish on top. The first two Rolls were delicious. The shrimp tempura inside the third roll was almost inedible, a very tough texture. We probably should have complained but we were enjoying ourselves and just decided to eat the fish and avocado off the top of the roll, which was tasty. No charge for BYOB is a plus! They also didn't open our wine for us so if they do start charging they may have to make a change to service or start with a very small fee. Overall a good experience and I will be back!"}
{"text":"We just did take out! This sushi is RIGHT ON. We ordered the scallop nigiri, crazy roll, penguin roll, and scallop roll. 
The penguin roll was by far my favorite. 
After we ordered, we sat at the small table at the entrance to wait. The hostess came by with waters for us. 
The order did not take more than 10 minutes to complete, and we were out the door with an order that was very reasonably priced. 

Sufficiently happy belly right now :)"}
{"text":"Awesome service!! You must try the Steeler Sushi Roll! Mr. Kim is very personable and the food is GREAT!!"}
{"text":"I went for sushi. I got the chirashi dinner. It came with a salad. The fish was a gigantic portion of tuna salmon yellowtail and also came with omelette daikon and avocado. The dinner was $20. So cheap for so much sushi!  The rice had furikake on it. I couldn't eat it all. I had to get a doggie bag and take a lot of it home. The service was good."}
{"text":"fresh fish meat, creative menus, delicious sources, and decent prices. definitely one of the best sushi restaurants in PGH!!!"}
