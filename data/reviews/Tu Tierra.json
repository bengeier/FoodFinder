{"text":"Now called Tu Tierra, this charming restaurant still uses the Chinese style sign of the former tenant on its facade. The food is good and fairly authentic but the prices are high, even for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to various different Mexican restaurants and Tu Tierra is definitely one of the better ones. The service could have been a bit better but the Chimichanga Beef Burrito was fantastic. The portion size was very large for the price and overall extremely tasty. I will be back to try other things on the menu. Thanks!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think it looking at this place from the outside...or the inside, but it makes it's a pretty good Mexican restaurant.    I've tried a number of different Mexican restaurants in the city over the years and I'm usually a little disappointed.  Not in this case, Mi Tierra exceeded my expectations.  I ordered the Tortilla Soup and the beef chimichanga.  Both were excellent choices.    Bottom line, Mi Tierra has friendly staff, generous portions, and quality food.  I'll definitely go back.    Oh, and did anyone catch the 'art' in the entry?  Painted old ATM.  Weird."}
{"text":"Liked the free chips and salsa. Service has been good both times been. The decore is million times better then when it was China City. The sign shows of those days with swoops curling bad luck up.   Both times I ordered Chimmichangas and second time quality not as good as 1st as watery. Neighborhood restaurant so eventually will try again.  B-)"}
{"text":"Went to Mi Tierra for a family dinner in December. The atmosphere is warm and pleasant, echos the homeland of the owners and staff. The food was fantastic, I had enchiladas mole and it was the best mole I've tasted since being in Mexico! We all enjoyed the spicy salsa and chips and taquitos. The service was friendly and the food piping hot. The only negative of the experience would be that the server took a long time to return to our table, but she was the only one working and we were not in any hurry. Very enjoyable place to eat."}
{"text":"The servers are friendly, the food is good, inexpensive, and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. Granted, the food isn't any sort of extravagant gourmet fare, its just simple and satisfying. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Mexican food, is often simple.... I ended up taking my folks here for lunch on a Monday. We were greeted and seated quickly; the server was prompt and answered all our questions. We were served corn chips and salsa.... the chips were crisp and not greasy, the sauce was fresh with a bit of a bite - a nice surprise. I ordered the Enchiladas Verdes with rice and beans. The Verde sauce was truly delicious. I sampled the Chicken tacos which were delicious mounds of shredded chicken, and a beef quesadilla which had a nice mix of cheese and shredded meat.  Everything was flavourful, felt scratch made...and delicious.  We were in and out in about an hour... and were very satisfied.  I am sad I have not been sooner. We will be back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"My first experience was this week and I lived in the Southwest U.S. for many years.  I am not a mexican culinary expert,  but I did bring my friend who is.   Both of us were extremely happy and satisfied with the quality of the food.  Apparently this restaurant is as good as Hugo's in Houston.   There is so much selection and variety of food.  The orange pork was divine as the orange taste stayed in your mouth as an enticing after taste.   Highly recommend it.  They also knew exactly how to make an outstanding Cadillac Margarita."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.   Oh, how I wish I'd know that in advance. Unfortunately, that's exactly what I and a group of friends did, to celebrate a birthday party.   Why is this a problem? They are chronically understaffed, and the space is ridiculously noisy because of how many people are crammed in. Ergo, the service becomes non-existent and you can't hear anyone else at your table.   Which means that it may take you an hour and a half to get your dinner... once you've ordered it, which wouldn't have been so bad if they hadn't  a) taken 1.5 hours to ask us for our order  b) hadn't come to take our drink order until 30 minutes after we were seated  c) didn't take the second drink order until 30 minutes after some more friends joined us  d) we couldn't get refils at all after this until after our meals were served e)didn't bring us chips and salsa refill when more people joined our table, even after we asked 2 times (the third time we asked, we got some).   We were here from 6:00 to 8:30pm, and we left as soon as we had eaten - it wasn't that we hated what we had ate, but that we were now late for the second part of the party!   The food was great; delicious, fresh and affordable, and the portions were massive. Because of this, I'd be willing to try it again (at lunchtime perhaps), but there's no way I'll ever agree to dinner there again!"}
{"text":"Tu Tierra is a hidden gem of Mexican goodness. Tucked away from the usual places, it's often easy to walk in and find a table.   Truly amazing food, very authentic. It's not fine dining, but that says more about the atmosphere than the food. We've been here quite a few times now and keep coming back. Great food and genuine friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great food. The service is a little slow, but still very attentive. Pricing is fair for the overwhelming amount of food you receive. Definitely going to go back again."}
{"text":"This is one of those strange places that doesn't quite add up...though, the good thing is it ends up being much more than the sum of it's parts.  Taken individually, this place isn't anything special.  The decor and space are bare bones. The old Chinese restaurant sign outside has been re-purposed, and the interior walls have been coated in a fake adobe and brick. The service varies between super friendly, albeit a little slow, to almost non-existent. The menu, at first blush, doesn't offer anything that jumps out as great value or weird or wonderful.  However, what they do well, they do very well, so I just keep coming back. Enchiladas are great across the board. Mole has a nice balance of chile, sesame and cocoa, and the entomatadas with jalapeno and avocado in a buttery tomato sauce are dynamite. Standout tacos include the chorizo, rajas con queso, and cochinita pibil. The pibil can also be had in the sopes or even on a tostada if you ask (a single tostada makes a great appetizer). Sides of rice and beans don't look particularly special, but always taste great.  Standard selection of Mexican beers (though no Tecate) and sodas. I particularly like the non-alcoholic sangria pop.  We come here whenever my folks are in town, and my celiac dad has never had an issue. They're happy to swap in corn tortillas on most dishes and since everything's made in-house they know what has flour in it.  I'm always a little reticent to bring people here, becausef I'm never sure if they'll find the flavor and charm that I like so much. But I do have to say, Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Was at Tu Tierra last week. It was okay, the food was alright. I was at El Sombero Restaurante here in Calgary on 17th Avenue a few years back and this was definitely a much better Mexican experience, the food was a lot better and there was actually Mexican music playing in the background. I just recently found out after searching El Sombero that it is now closed, very sad.  Anyways, back to Tu Tierra. The service was okay, there was only one server in the restaurant. There definitely needed to at least another server as she couldn't do it all herself. I noticed once people left around us that their dirty dishes sat on table and never removed, I wonder how long their dirty dishes and ours sat on the table after we left. Dirty dishes should be removed as soon as the guests leave.  I will be back to give it another chance."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as it is not too far from where we live. So when one of our supper club members picked the spot -  I was ready to go!  The decor was plain and simple...could use a little more pizzazz in my opinion but then again, I didn't come here to look at the walls. The servers were friendly and greeted us quickly.  The place was a bit bigger than I expected based on other reviews.  I had a Margarita - it wasn't the bast I've had but it wasn't terrible. I had a water with it too...sadly I should have rationed it as they didn't come back and offer more water for the rest of the meal. Also, just an FYI...they offer Margaritas and beer. Nothing else from a booze perspective so if you are picky and your adult drink tastes fall outside those options, you'll be having a dry evening.  You do get chips and salsa to start and they were pretty tasty. My partner and I then ordered a shrimp appetizer dish - basically 8 medium sized shrimps in a light spicy sauce with a little lettuce. It tasted okay to me but my partner hated it which is unusual for us. I do wish they had more appies that were good for sharing that weren't based on wrapping something in a tortilla. The other issue I had with the appies was that the mains came out 2 minutes later and we weren't really ready for them (even though we had ordered the appies with our initial drink orders and the mains significantly later).  My main dish was a chicken chimichanga. I expected it to be crispier - it looked exactly the same as my friends chicken burrito. However it was relatively tasty and the potion was giant. At that point in the meal though it was starting to feel like everything tasted the same...the chips and salsa, the chimichanga, the appetizer etc, so I wasn't really hungry/inspired to eat anymore. I decided to take my leftovers home. They brought us take out containers and we needed to pack them ourselves.  This is a cute little spot and the food is decent but not spectacular. The service is homey and friendly. I might try it again but it wouldn't be anything I'd rush back to unless others wanted to go."}
{"text":"We wanted something a little different on a recent Saturday evening and Canadian pub food just wouldn't cut it. Mexican seemed perfect so using John Gilchrist's \"Cheap Eats\" app, we quickly found Tu Tierra ( not to be confused with Mi Tierra which seems to be listed at the same Fairmont Dr address???) It was about 20 minutes before their closing time so we asked if they would still serve us. Getting a positive response we sat down expecting to wait for a long time for our dinners. The setting is bus depot basic but there is a certain police station quality to the lighting. The bright bare bulbs over our heads soon had me confessing my desire for an enchilada. My wife also broke down quickly under questioning and ordered the chicken fajitas. The meals were delivered with amazing alacrity and were ginormous. The salsa verde on the chicken was pleasantly piquant and we were fully satisfied with every morsel. We showed our appreciation by cleaning our plates meticulously. The price was very reasonable and we will return soon...with sunglasses."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times now, and I can honestly say, we've never once had a bad meal. Nothing to complain about.  We've eaten in, and had wonderful service, and even better food. I've also done take out for roughly 6 people, more often than not you get home and the place your ordered from has forgotten something, didn't have the issue here!  I love the chicken verde for my meal, and the taquitos to start! I've tried the burritos and liked them just as much. You get more then what you pay for as well, those portions are great! It's authentic, it's warm, and it's delicious!  And if you have a sweet tooth, but don't have time or room for dessert, I recommend the horchata! It's vanilla-y and cinnamon-y, and all kinds of great tasting!  I recommend anyone to go here!"}
{"text":"Casual dining. Been here several times and it's  Always delicious...love washing everything down with their yummy margs."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with my finance and I was not disappointed. From the moment we talked in the service was excellent. There was no point in time where if we needed assistance we didn't get it. The food was amazing!! Best Mexican joint by far that I have been too. Check it out !!! You won't leave disappointed"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in town has finally reopened! Took my lady friend tonight, and it was predictably awesome. The new location is nicely decorated and better than where they were previously. Service and meals are the same high standard and large portions they're famous for. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Probably my fault, tried something different last nite. Usually have the enchiladas sopes but tried a beef chimichanga, totally overwhelmed by the too spicy tomato sauce...and I like hot but also flavor. Love this place for it's authenticity and true cantina feel but you have to experiment to find out what you like."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, friendly and a joy to be around! Margaritas were delicious! I had the chicken fajitas and they were a bit salty but still very tasty. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"we've been BIG fans of Mi Tierra and Tu Tierra for the last 3 or 4 years now. We started going to the original location (Mi Tierra) and absolutely LOVE the food - it's quite excellent. However, when they opened the second location (Tu Tierra), they increased the prices and we feel that it's a bit overpriced (like 2 or 3 dollars per plate). we've been going A LOT less since they increased the prices. we used to go for weekend lunches, but just can't justify paying $15 each for a plate of tacos or enchiladas with rice and beans. :("}
{"text":"Cozy surroundings. I love that it's not a huge place.   The food was fantastic, and the margaritas were delish! The fajitas were served piping hot, and I couldn't possibly eat everything on my plate. I haven't had mexican food this good since I was in SoCal."}
{"text":"Good little original Mexican. Quality food and friendly staff, though their menu is limited. Well worth a date night."}
{"text":"Horchata! I missed you! If you like iced chai lattés, Tu Tierra makes Horchata, a sweet drink made with homemade rice milk, cinnamon and sugar that our server promised would be refreshing. I got addicted to the stuff back in Cali and was sad when none of the Mexican restaurants here seemed to offer it.  After eating the complimentary chips and salsa, splitting an appetizer with my two ladies and making a sincere attempt at plowing through an enormous plate of Rajas Tacos, rice and beans, I was ready for my food coma. Which was witnessed later on at the movies, har!  My one beef with Tu Tierra is their rice. Or should I say, Uncle Ben's Bistro Express Vegetable Medley. I know you! I ate you for years at my retail job!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken mole which was really great and generous portion sizes. The prices are decent at about $13-$17 a plate. The service was fantastic, very friendly people and nice ambience."}
{"text":"This location is also called Tu Tierra.  (Hopefully this helps people searching.)  Anyway, this place served me the only amazing burrito I've had outside of San Francisco.  It was the chile verde burrito, was large, spicy and came on a plate with a layer of cheese on top.  If this place was closer to where I live and sold burritos wrapped in tin-foil to go, I'd drop by every week."}
{"text":"Far from our NW haven but we will drive for good Mexican food in a heartbeat. In my top 3 fave cuisines. No Mexican music playing, just the soccer game blasting. Not so good for first impressions. Casual, no frills interior. Service, nonchalantly friendly. Some evident laziness - floors, tables and menus need a scrub. Beer - cold and fantastic. You have to ask for water to be brought to your table. Hubby ordered the Carne Asada burrito following a Yelpers' recommendation. They are HUGE! But he managed to eat it all! We came here very hungry! I ordered the recommended (by server) Enchiladas Verdes. Came out looking good! Everything is said the be homemade here and the chef himself is said to be Mexican. The Carne - was not so good. Tough and had an off flavor in the burrito. My Verde sauce was good as was the chicken in the enchilada but it was no more than a 3 star dish. It lacked seasoning and I had to ask for more pico de gallo (an extra buck but very fresh). No salt or pepper on the table. I did not find the food spicy, nor the salsa on the table for the chips as others have mentioned on line. BUT knowing how much I love heat after telling him, our waiter brought me a yellowish hot sauce (habanero) that I wish I could bottle from here and take home. My rice and beans really needed the hot sauce as again, they were bland and had no flavor, even with cheese on them! (I truly think the rice is the store bought prepackaged stuff) I honestly like Salt and Pepper Mexican Restaurant better than this place if I had to choose. I do not like to compare but the food and ambiance there is more my style.  No Sangria here either! Why? Would only come back if invited by someone else. It is quite pricey for Mexican fare."}
{"text":"We liked the food at Mi Tierra.  Now we also like the new Tu Tierra however I agree with the first person who reviewed.  It's over priced but the food is very good.  The old place charged around $10 for everything, now it's all around $15.  Quite a jump.  Most restaurants are over priced in Calgary so we might as well go where it's good.  I love the chicken burrito.  Husband loves the enchiladas in green salsa.    They serve homemade tortilla chips when you're seated. They are amazing, just like Mexico.  However the salsa that came with it sucks!  It's not homemade and tastes like tomatoe paste.   They could do better.    The lighting is very bright and has a classroom feel.  I wish they would install dimmer switches and use candle light."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town :) you even get salsa and chips to start and staff are always friendly. You must try the enchiladas verde!"}
{"text":"I loved the place, but since it re-opened the food all tastes the same. You are still allowed to use spice since taking over guys!"}
{"text":"I have been to Tu Tierra several times. I have to admit the first time I visited was when FFWD had freshly reviewed this place and gave it positive reviews. I wasn't impressed mainly because the place was SWAMPED and this quaint little place could not handle the volume. They did their best with the service and the food looked rushed.  A year later I decided to try this place again for lunch and it was 10x better, so much that I can stamp this as a \"Yay! I'm a fan\" on yelp. The service was great and the food tasted significantly better. I have visited this place several times for dinner and lunch since. Their lunch combos are a great deal and since I only have a 40 minute lunch, Tu Tierra is a surprisingly quick visit for a restaurant. $20 is the usual amount I would spend for a lunch meal, while for dinner the prices are a little more higher.  Their enchiladas verdes and mole are my favourite dishes. In my humble opinion this place is one of the 2nd best in the city, the first going to a two way tie between the two Mexican households of my friends. Given the right amount of volume, quiet restaurants like Tu Tierra can really shine as they have the right opportunity to be more attentive and give more time to the preparation of their dishes.  I feel like I should depart with some sort of humorous anecdote...but the enchiladas de mole digesting in my stomach only results in me seeing visions. Visions of...LUCHADORES!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YxQJxQcY8o  bwahahaha"}
{"text":"Had the chorizo cheese special dish with tortillas   Good, huge portion , too many raw onions though, kinda took away from the flavor , pico de galo excellent, horchata (rice, vanilla cinnamon iced drink ) was excellent  Could have made the 4 th star if the onions hadn't overpowered the rest of the dish"}
{"text":"We went to this wonderful restaurant for my birthday.   I wanted a margarita and was surprised when the waiter asked if I wanted it shaken or blended.    Most restaurants don't give you a choice, I was impressed that this one did.   Their flavoured Pina Coladas are wonderful too!  But on to the food.   The shrimp in the Shrimp Burrito that my daughter marveled was as big as her forearm was tender and lovely.    The appetizers were fresh and wonderful.  I love their homemade Salsa and chips and will we be going there again and again?  You  bet.  My mother is already planning to take my sister there when she arrives from England next week.  I can hardly wait to try some of their other choices.   And the fresh garnish of chopped lettuce and tomato and onion is perfect with each entrée.   The best part?  The price!   It is now our go-to for a quick bite or a fun evening with friends.   Ayyyyy Tu Tierra!"}
{"text":"You can always tell if an ethnic restaurant is good when it's filled with expats from the country that it claims its dishes from. Let me tell you, there was a lot of Spanish being spoken at this place.  The portions are generous and the food is balanced. I was left sweating from the hot sauce that I added to my chimichanga.  Definitely will return. Great lunch spot, probably even better for dinner."}
{"text":"Tu Tierra is a gem in SE Calgary. Admittedly the service wasn't over the top, but the food is something worth coming back for. As first timers, my significant other and I ensured we ordered very different dishes to get the best feel for the place as possible.  Like most Mexican restaurants, Tu Tierra provided us with complimentary chips and salsa. Because I wasn't yet allowed to have anything as crunchy as chips, I left these for my significant other, who told me the salsa had quite a bit of kick.  We both had enchiladas in the end. Mine were vegetarian, and so incredibly delicious! The layers of cheese, beans, and sauce were outstanding. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Tu Tierra has reopened at its new location at 8995 Bonaventure Dr SE, which is not far from their old location.  The food is still great and the location is many times better than the old one. It has a beautiful floor, modern kitchen, bar and washrooms and a patio that they will use in the summer."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa. Salsa great. Spicy and a bit smoky. A bit too much for your average pendejo. Would have liked to see the chips warmed. Can't deny the fact that them actually bringing them to the table when we sat down was a refreshing change from what the local standard is.   Lime margaritas delicious. It's worth it to show up here just for these.   Verde and Mole enchiladas were shared. Very good flavour in both. Rice and beans left us wanting. I'm really not sure if this is traditional in certain regions of Mexico but I expected something more flavourful than what hey brought.   Dinner for two with a couple drinks each, appetizer and two entries ran $80. Not out of the ballpark.   A fix in the flavour profile of the beans and rice and a bit more work on the entries would have forced me to award these guys a 4 star. Would return to try some more things on the menu. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I hit up Tu Tierra with a group of Yelpers - it was a fun experience. I'd never been as it's in a section of town I rarely frequent (south of Glenmore - what's that?)  The parking was a little dicey... especially backing out when the spots all around me were full. And I found the spots tight - I have a small car so it's not such a big deal but makes it squishy when larger vehicles are parked.  The interior is nice and the tables are easy enough to move to fit larger parties.   One thing that I was disappointed about were the margaritas. They were a little weak and needed something to punch them up. I noticed they use the same sort of margarita mix as me, so I'd recommend increasing the triple sec a little and adding some lime cordial to give it a kick.  One of our group had some issues finding a vegan option, and when it arrived, although she'd specified no dairy, there was cheese on the beans. They quickly took it away, noticing it before she had to say anything, but still she didn't get them back until we were pretty much done eating.  The problem? One server for the whole restaurant, it seemed. Don't get me wrong, she was very friendly, but it meant delays in getting our drinks, etc. and I never did get my water :(  Also, the food's a little overpriced, in my opinion, for what you get.  Beware - they make spicy the norm. I'm great with spice so it's not a big deal for me, but in Canada (Calgary, anyway) everything is usually mild with spice upon request. I'm not docking any stars for this, but letting prospective customers know to expect spice!  All in all, I'd come again because the food is authentic Mexican and very delish. But not sure I'd make it a \"go to\" place for the various reasons outline above.  BTW - I was wavering between a 3 and a 4... darn not having half stars!"}
{"text":"Wait a second... authentic Mexican food in...Calgary? Really? Can it be?  Yes ladies and gentlemen it can.  As sad as it is to see that China City bit the dust, a restaurant that had been around since my parents were kids, this is a great replacement for the neighbourhood. You know the food must be good if you see Mexicans eating there (can't say I've seen any Mexicans at the Taco Time across the street).  I travel to So Cal regularly where the Mexican food is fantastic (obviously). So to make a proper comparison I went with the Carne Asada burrito. The flavour was a little different than what I'm used to but it was still excellent. The portion size is great and the price is right.  What tipped this up to a five-star review for me was the fact that they make Horchata. I love this stuff. If you come here you need to order a pitcher of it. Yes, you have to get a pitcher, but it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"I tried their beef burrito, it was good, but the price is a bit steep. Almost $16 for a burrito to me seems high. For this reason, I would still be on the lookout for a combination of good food and good price. The free nachos is good though"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious I want to go again and again. Food was fresh and super hot. Lots of hot sauce to choose from to add. HUGE portion for how much you pay. Just delicious over all everyone was super happy with their food."}
{"text":"Best real Mexican in Calgary.  I know cause I'm from Texas  I've eaten here twice.  Had the pozole and the special tacos alhamre con queso.  Portions are muy grande  Great red sauce, nice corn totias and Mexican cervezas.  Looking forward to trying the tortia soup next time.  They usually have charro beans  Ask the friendly little waitress for extra limes and try to get her to sing Cu cu rucucu Paloma along with the music"}
{"text":"Went here last Monday for a quarterly dinner between friends. Got seated promptly by the friendly waitress (she was the only one serving customers at that time with the place only a quarter full).   When everybody in our party of four arrived, we each ordered our own entrée - a mistake on our part. Some of the portions are huge (I'm looking at you chicken burrito) and would probably have been best split between those of us who ordered similar dishes.   The good news is that the food is pretty tasty and quite hot - which I'm going to assume is how most people like their Mexican food. Regrettably, I'm not really a big spicy food fan, so I admit I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. I'm trying to get my tolerance up though, I swear.  This place was highly recommended to me by Mexican friends as well as friends who like Mexican food. My friends who came with me also enjoyed their meals respectively.   I guess my point is - just because I can't handle my spice doesn't mean it should stop you from enjoying a good Mexican meal."}
{"text":"On our last day in Calgary, my friend and I checked all over Yelp for the spot where we would grab our last dinner.... I guess we should've done a bit more research, as this place was a disappointment.  First off, I am by no means a \"location snob\" or \"decor snob\" but this place's location and decor is just horrible... looks run down and in all honesty, my friend and I felt awkward sitting in there after around 10 minutes.   Our waiter took a pretty long time to attend to us and ask us for our drink orders... Also, I asked him for the wifi info, he said he'd be right back with it and he never returned to give the info... he just came back like 15 mins later to take our order.   The complimentary chips and salsa were mediocre at best, nothing special.. cold chips and average salsa, although the salsa did seem somewhat homemade. Because of the decor and ambiance we skipped drinks and appetizers. For my entree I ordered \"the trio\" 3 enchiladas (1 verde, 1 entomatada, 1 mole) with Mexican rice and refried beans. The verde enchilada and the entomatada enchilada were very tasty but the mole was odd. The enchiladas had a good amount of spice and were just yummy. However, the Mexican rice was not Mexican rice at all and the refried beans had zero flavor!! Huge disappointment. My friend ordered the chicken quesadilla and we both agreed that it was bad. They used a corn tortilla instead of a flour tortilla and that threw the whole thing off... They barely grilled it, and it only came with a \"side salad\" which was old lettuce and ONE SLICE of avocado... No rice or beans (not that they were good anyway lol).  If I was you I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ordered the speciality tacos:  Camaron, chorizo & pina and also Alambre con queso.  Both were very good although a bit more salty than my liking.  Service was good too."}
{"text":"Been going to Tu Tierra for a few years, and am never disappointed. Delicious food, such friendly staff. Am looking forward to my next visit, as I am now craving the chile Verde Burrito."}
{"text":"Oh Yidah, you were run off your feet being the only server on last night at Tu Tierra, but for the entire two and a half hours we were there, you had a cheerful demeanor and a bright smile. Kudos! You get five fabulous stars, running all that food and fulfilling our demands for more, more, more margaritas all by your lonesome! Even though things took a moment or two to make it our way,  you didn't miss a thing.  The complementary chips and salsa were a lovely touch. For those yelpers not so keen on a spicy salsa, you may want to just stick with the chips. My chicken tostada came out looking like smiley face. For real, it totally did! And it sure did leave my tummy smiling. Yum!   Also, horchata? Just might be my new favourite non-alcoholic bevvy.  Although the margaritas were only $6.50, these are what's pulling the rating down from a 5 to a 4. Made from a mix, it could use a wee bit more punching up - whether that be with some fresh lime juice or an extra dash a little somethin' somethin' to make it a smidge stronger.  There's an extra section on the other side of the restaurant, it'd make good use for a large group of people, and when I first got here, there were quite a few folks waiting for takeout. Looks like that's a good option too!  April Underdog Challenge: 16/30"}
{"text":"Glad there was a \"no tip\" option in their credit card machine, I used it.  I have a soft spot for the Latin culture, I lived in South America for a long time, and consider it to be part of my global \"home\"... Yet in Tu Tierra I wasn't even motivated to talk to those guys in Spanish.  Out from the door we were greeted by a nasty, fake smile of a \"chief\" waitress. That was it - than she turned her back to us and barely squeezed a couple of words through her mouth further on. Not just unfriendly, she was totally hostile - without a minimal reason or excuse.  Another server, all reverse, was trying to be helpful - but the \"boss\" one was hissing and bashing her all the time. The whole picture was disgusting, and keeping in mind that dining room (that with the window) was tiny, the whole drama was pretty punishing to all the visitors.  I thought maybe it was us, but in the next 15 or 20 minutes uncomfortable scenes were following one another! For example, elderly couple with a daughter enters the door and waits to be seated, next to the sign. Bossing server throws them \"wait\" and turns her back - than she and another server keep on moving around the room, completely ignoring the customers. After a long awkward pause, visitors sit on their own - and the servers toss them water like nothing happened!  We were lucky to be served by a \"friendly\" waitress, who was very kind and helpful. However, the food was very much so-so. It took ages to get it, portions were rather small (though cheap), meat was burned, vegetables were bland. Not cool.  Now we're done, seating and waiting, and nothing happens. We've noticed that people were going to the counter to pay, but thought it was because they were done waiting. Not sure if that's the rule, but after a long wait I've just raised my ass and went to pay at the counter. The \"boss\" waitress caught me in the middle and requested (not asked) which plates we've ordered. Done with that, I've paid to a guy at the bar and off we went - felt like breathing fresh air again.  I don't know what the hell was wrong with that principal server, as she greeted a selected two or three customers in a very friendly manner, but we were not so lucky. Our stay was miserable, food mediocre, and overall experience a clearly never return, never recommend.  PS: Parking there was a terrible crap, too - tiny little spots, placed at an angle. Keeping in mind that most people are unable to stay within those yellow lines, one may as well park on the street, or risk damaging the car. Another reason not to visit Tu Tierra."}
{"text":"Been a handful of times and each time I'm wishing I had more room in my stomach to enjoy just a few more bites.  Each element from all the different salsa's, refried beans, rice and various sauces are well executed.  The meat has been tender whether it's been seafood, chicken or beef.   Their tortilla soup is wonderful, creamy, refreshing and filling. Their stuffed jalapeno's have so much flavor and perfectly cheesy.  The burrito's and enchilada's are pretty authentic/typical no new territory being forged in terms of execution or elements, but they still don't disappoint.  Going to try the molcajete next time as it looks very good. Blended margarita's are offered in a variety of flavors and are balanced never saccharine.  The service is very basic but efficient, just be direct or flag them down since they're always around.  If you've found yourself craving Mexican and don't want to put up with the downtown crowds, come to Tu Tierra!"}
{"text":"The decor is fairly basic but the restaurant is spacious and can accommodate larger groups without feeling crowded, which is nice.  The restroom looked as though it has been well used.  It could stand to be updated.  Mi Tierra closes at 9pm on most nights so make sure you get in early if you want to take your time.  I had the Chiles Rellenos (stuffed peppers).  This was quite good, as were the beans.  The rice was very plain but I suppose that's normal.  I didn't ask if there was more than cheese in the peppers and I couldn't tell because it was smothered in tomato sauce.  No complaints about that though.  This dish was served with tortillas on the side but I found a few of them a bit dry.  Clearly it didn't bother me enough to not eat them because I didn't leave an ounce of food behind.  Overall, the meal was okay and I'd order it again.  I sampled my friend's margarita and it wasn't very good.  I'm not sure what it was, but I can make better ones at home.  I had a Corona instead and you can't go wrong with that.  I'd say that Mi Tierra is a reasonable neighborhood option for Mexican food but it's really far from where I live so unless someone chooses this location again, I won't make the trip.  If you are in a large group like I was (8 people), expect the gratuity to be added to your bill."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and usually feel satisfied. The ambiance is poor, service is usually good. I do feel it is overpriced for what you get. Last visit I ordered a chicken burrito and it was tasty, but nothing else on the plate except a bit of lettuce and the whole burrito was floating in juice. I would expect to at least get a side of rice or beans for the cost. I would probably go elsewhere next time I wanted Mexican food."}
{"text":"It's not bad. A bit far for me but if you're in the neighbourhood then this joint is the perfect fix for some delicious Mexican."}
{"text":"The Verdes sauce knocked our socks off. The flavor was so spectacular I didn't dare use a drop of hot sauce, something I always use.   This is the best Mexican restaurant in town. I wasn't sure until I tried it myself, but I had been told by a reliable foodie friend of mine that this restaurant was the winner, best Mexican restaurant in Calgary. He was right.   This location will move in a couple months time to Bonaventure Drive from Fairmount, a close street nearby with more traffic. Details on the move will be on their website: www.tutierra.ca   We came here for lunch and started with the chicken tostadas ($8.49). The refried beans, rice and crispy corn tortillas topped with heaps of fresh delicious meat and lettuce & sour cream melted in our mouths. What sticks out here is the flavor. Is it fresh lemon? Hand ground chili? Not sure but whatever chef is doing back there, he's doing right.  Our main course was even better than our starter. Enchiladas Verdes ($13.49) was fresh, heavenly to eat, satisfying.   Staff was lovely, food fresh, tasty and authentic."}
{"text":"Mexican food in Canada. At least they're both in North America, right? I don't know why my tummy was thinking about burritos and tacos, but I let it drive the car here.  Service was good, but I'm an easy customer. I was able to figure out a beer quickly ($5.75 for a bottled Mexican beer!) and while she went off to get that, I settled on my dinner choice. Authentic (or at least as authentic as it gets north of the Rio Grande) chicken enchiladas drenched in a spicy verde salsa and rice and beans. It was prepped and delivered to me in less than five minutes.  Ten minutes later, I looked down and my plate was empty. I'm sure someone ran into the restaurant while I wasn't paying attention and stole my dinner. It was gone and all I had left was a full stomach and a slight spicy burn on my lips.  Why is beer so expensive in Canada? Without it, this would have been a $15 meal with tip. I'm glad I decided not to have another - there's something wrong with two drinks costing more than the main."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst Mexican food I have had. My tacos seemed sweet. Nothing was spicy. The rice was bland and sweet. I keep hoping to find good Mexican since moving here but seems to not exist.  Nice staff though and seemed clean."}
{"text":"Good mexican food and very much like many of the restaurants in Mexico. I would say this is one of the best in Calgary but it is not \"fine dining\" there seems to be no such thing here in Calgary when it comes to mexican unfortunately. If you want excellent Mexican I think the option is to learn to cook it."}
{"text":"I've been to Tu Tierra a few times, and found it simply delicious.  Even when the restaurant is busy, the service is good and the food is authentic and delicious.  I've had the burritos and enchiladas and enjoyed both immensely."}
