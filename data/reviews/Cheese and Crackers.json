{"text":"My issue with this store is not the quality of the products. I have found the cheese and the meats to be of very high quality and enjoyed them immensely. I love the variety. I've gotten chocolates there, too. Delicious. However, there is more to running a great establishment than the quality of your product, it's the employees, it's interaction with the business owner.   I have gotten sandwiches there before. The Italian is delicious, the veggie is great, too. However, one time I got my sandwich (an Italian) back to the office and the bread was so tough that I could not bite through it, and I have a good set of chomers!! I know baguettes should be tough to a certain extent so they won't get soggy from condiments and such, however, this was completely inedible.  In their defense, it only happened once, but for $8 a sandwich, I should always have something edible. I feel like the employee should have been able to feel how tough the bread was as it was being cut. I'll give them a pass on the bread. That's not my what really upset me. I WOULD have been willing to go back and try again however what I experienced in the store the last time I went in will prevent me from returning.   As I was ordering, the owner came out of the back and started yelling his other employee in front of me.  I felt embarrassed for her. First of all, if you have an issue with an employee or their actions, it should NOT be screamed in the employee's face, that is unprofessional. Employee issues should be handled calmly, professionally, and respectfully in an office and out of sight of your customers. I was very uncomfortable as this was happening. I regret not speaking up at the time but I find it best not to confront angry people who are larger than me. I just wanted to get my cheeses and get the heck out of there. The issue he was screaming about was olives. Freaking olives. Losing your temper, screaming, and waving your hands  over olives is ridiculous, sir. You should probably see a counselor for your anger issues.   While I understand that owning a business and managing employees is difficult and stressful, I was utterly disgusted by his behavior. Initially, I thought I would bite my tongue and chalk it up to a bad day, but obviously this is his norm. He's doesn't care if he humiliates his employees in front of customers. I'm not the only one who has witnessed this and mentioned it in a review.  Please sir, change your behavior before you lose any more customers."}
{"text":"There are few delis in this area. I was charged with taking a \"tasty lunch\" in with me to the office to eat before my boyfriend and I pretended to buckle down and carry on with our research projects. You can order sandwiches here to take away, however you really only have the option of ordering what's on the board, or some very similar variation of. Fair enough - the function isn't primarily to serve as a restaurant. The young guy working behind the counter this Sunday afternoon was meticulous and patient with me, even as others began to trickle into the store. Pricey, yes, but if I really wanted to save money I could have grabbed a particle \"meat\" and American cheese concoction next door. P.S., long story long, the service was very good and the food was good. My bf, with a more sophisticated and daring palette than mine, loved it. My only complaint was that the baguette used to make the sandwiches made consumption quite rough, but it's possible my dissatisfaction is due mostly to personal preference than anything else. Looks like a perfect place for meeting all of your cheesing needs, however.  Also, \"tomatoes\" is misspelled on the whiteboard, just by the by..."}
{"text":"I cannot tell a lie but no sandwich has compared to the sandwiches I get at this place.  I never even knew that I loved goat cheese. I am absolutely 100% addicted now. When I first went, a friend from San Francisco had looked up this place and I thought \"there's other stores around there but I'm down to go in and see\". We walked there on a summer night and when you first walk in, it doesn't strike you at first that they make sandwiches because they have samples of cheeses, sausages, olives etc. Along with of course various cheeses & crackers! Oh and chocolates and other delicacies it really is a true hidden gem and trust me I am very picky when it comes to sandwhiches but I am a cheese and crackers addict now. I really recommend going with how they come off of the list... maybe add some mayo  if you were obsessed with mayonnaise like me but I've even ordered it without it and forgot that it was not even on the sandwich because it was just that good but when I first went in the owner of the restaurant/store really explained how the flavors of the sandwich come out and all of that stuff that I'm thinking hey it's just a sandwich and I want this and I want that and then finally I thought I'll just take it how he says and oh my God he was right! 100% satisfaction. I always get the Woody's turkey. And I will admit something I had never had an artichoke that I knew of and I loved it. I keep their menu on my refrigerator and this is the only menu I keep out and I do it because I do Airbnb and when my guests ask where to grab a bite, I recommend there because it's less than a minute away from my house, you can walk there, and the price is comparable to all the other places around. Plus, I always end up having two meals with one sandwich so it is worth the money and the meat used is top of the line. Boar's Head is the brand. I really think anybody would be satisfied with their sandwiches and should give this place a try plus one of the girls and I have the same birthday ;)!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place Awsome customer service and great selection allows me to feel as though I'm in a small little shop in Europe love it nothing but good from here"}
{"text":"My new favorite sandwich in town! Quality ingredients really make this place amazing! A must try for gourmet sandwich lovers!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese platter as a birthday present and was very happy with it. I only knew that he liked a nice, hard gouda and the gentleman behind the counter helped me pick out other cheese that were similar. He obviously knew his cheese, and we were very happy with the selections he made for us."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of cheeses, with a helpful and informed staff.  A stop here is a special treat I try to bless myself with at least once a month."}
{"text":"LIFE SAVER!  8/2013 I cannot live without Boar's Head deli meats. The \"meats\" at the super market are terrible. The owner was behind the counter and was extremely helpful and gave us great recommendations when we told him what we were looking for. I will be a repeat customer.   Edit 8 months later: 4/2014 The prices seemed to just go higher and higher, and I've gotten sick from deli meat purchased there at an outrageous price twice now. It's the only place to get boars head but the small town premium is just ridiculous. I can live without boars head after all...."}
{"text":"The best place in C-U to get fresh fish, especially sushi grade (get on their email list to order it.). The emails could be better formatted, but the fish is excellent quality. They also have some good cheeses and meats, but that is not the real draw for me. I did see the owner be a bit rude and pretentious once, but Doug is great and so are the other employees who work there that I have had interactions with. Maybe everyone can have a bad day? I recommend them highly for the fresh fish and also have picked up meats and cheeses."}
{"text":"It's way overpriced. Almost pretentious. Easily 5-6 times more expensive than Trader Joe's. And the selection is limited. I understand that we need to pay a premium for being a small town, but this is too much!"}
{"text":"The sodas are interesting and the owner  was really pleasant had a good laugh with him."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is the best place to buy fresh seafood in town. Hell, maybe in all of central IL. They have EXTREMELY reasonable prices for sustainably farmed/caught seafood, most of which is organic, that you can order through their mailing list three times a week. Not only that but they have a huge variety of gourmet cheeses and deli meats in the store as well as chocolates and steaks. Now the quality of their products alone warrant five stars, but what really sends them over the edge for me is the great people they have working there. Do you have a question about a particular cheese? Give them a call or go into the store and one of the employees would be happy to tell you much more than you care to know. Would you like your food prepared in a certain way before you pick it up? They've done that for me many times and it's always been super tasty. Is there a product that you don't see in store or on their mailing list? Again, just ask! I once had the idea to make homemade beef stock and wasn't sure of where to buy the bones, but I called them up and they were happy to order them for me to pick up in store. Really this place is just flawless and it's a true pleasure to shop there. A true gem of an establishment."}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday and asked if they could fix a small cheese plate for three people that afternoon.  Not only did I get a fabulous platter of cheese, but also dried fruit, almonds, fruit spreads and wonderful crackers, it was delicious.  All this on a beautiful platter.  My friends and I were quite impressed."}
{"text":"They have a wide assortment of meats, cheeses, chocolates and delicious soda. YUM! They have great gourmet sandwiches with very, very tasty bread. Cool staff too! Ilene and Jada are fun! (difficult to spell names)  I recommend the delicious sandwiches with peppadews, their cheddar cheese, and yummy soda! !  They are very gouda! They won't make you bleu! Come spend your cheddar at cheese and crackers, don't delay, come today!"}
{"text":"Went to Cheese and Crackers with a couple friends the other day for the first time. I would give a five star rating, except for a couple reasons: the staff seemed very confused when I asked about the Yelp deal (free soda with purchase of sandwich and chocolate) and the interaction was awkward as a whole.  However, the sandwich was delicious. Very fresh ingredients, moist and succulent. I would definitely go back just because of how tasty the sandwich was. I wish I had gone there sometime before the day after I graduated from U of I."}
{"text":"This place is a straight up hater-free zone. One of the only places I trust in Champaign-Urbana to get things like fine cheeses and sushi quality fish.   Like I said, this place is a hater-free zone, you can even use that futuristic BitCoin money there. It's like I'm in the Matrix every time I buy stuff from there."}
{"text":"There's been a lot of hype about this place from my CU friends. And as you can imagine, after a long drive from Chicago to Champaign, I was looking forward to a tasty, hearty sandwich. I went to the shop on a Sunday afternoon, which may have affected the quality of my visit--I ordered the vegetarian sandwich and was given a sandwich with brown lettuce, minimal artichoke hearts, no herbs on stale bread. And for this, I paid $8.99. For one sub-par sandwich. Overrated if you ask me. Or, maybe I need to go back on a Monday, when they have fresh veggies and baguettes."}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with CnC. I love the fresh fish list and the deli selection. I dislike the constant need to comparison shop the prices to see how badly I may be getting hosed. I also dislike that I need to work overtime to feed my addiction to their fresh shrimp.  I wish they'd get rid of the absurdly expensive/pretentious chocolates and replace that cabinet with fresh sides/salads made with their seafood or deli selections - shrimp salad, cheese pairings, etc.   Overall, Bart is a super nice guy who works very hard to please his customers. At one point, he even offered to deliver an order when I had discovered an error. It is a little uppity, but it's in an uppity location and serving a specific clientele. We'll keep going, hoping they get a bigger space and keep double-checking.  Edit: I'm getting annoyed with not being able to get a sandwich because they're out of bread. It's bread. Over-order and take the loss, for crying out loud. That's three times, now. One more and I'm out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend raved to me about how Bart is so selective with what comes in and is sold at the shop. He also seriously talked up the sandwiches. Given that sandwiches are my favorite food and I'm one of these \"I'll be the judge of that\" types, we went in and I was cautiously optimistic. BEST SANDWICH IN TOWN-- so, so good. We also purchased some drinks and an awesome jarred vodka sauce that I kind of doubted could be as good as the description card on the display. It said something about Bart and his wife trying a bunch of vodka sauces (over a hundred, I think) and choosing their favorite and that this particular one stood out so high above the rest that they tasted it and exchanged a look of deep knowing and agreement that this was indeed the best they'd tried. Well, he was right and now I go in there knowing that everything was chosen and has a purpose there and I love it so much."}
{"text":"I love the place for the fresh fishes ~~  Oysters so yummy~"}
{"text":"If you are fortunate enough to be able to eat here you must! Sandwiches made to order cheese and meat selection outstanding. The young lady who helped us was incredible. Chocolates exquisite. No bathroom. Soda selection fun and interesting. Don't miss this place!! This is a deli, not a restaurant so don't expect to come in and find a table."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and such friendly service! We bought dates, olives, cheese, and chocolate. Cheese and Crackers treats food as experiences, not just products -- as it should be."}
{"text":"Great selection of specialty cheeses & meats along with a lovely selection of chocolates. The owners are great - and the service is awesome! Really love all the food and staff!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with everything I've bought here: scallops, salmon, halibut, trout.  The owner provides great customer service. They just started carrying low acid coffee which we used to have to buy from Trader Joes in Chicago. Ask to receive the fish and meat emails."}
{"text":"Have been a long time customer, but this place is going downhill. Lots of confusion and mistakes with orders, short shipments, emails that contradict themselves, & a GM by the name of Jayda who is unprofessional, has a bad temper, & is totally unpleasant. I called to ask an honest question and was exceedingly respectful in speaking to her; however, she started berating me and hung up on me for no reason at all, so I'm done. I can put up with the mistakes and confusion but the bad attitude seals the deal. I will not set foot in that place until she is gainfully employed *elsewhere.*"}
{"text":"Freshest fish in town along with a great selection of cheeses, meats, pastas, sauces, chocolate crackers, olives and more. A very knowledgeable and helpful staff is a great plus!"}
{"text":"Went probably half a dozen times and got what I needed (fresh mozzarella), but called or drove there an equal number of times to find that they were out.   The only time I got upset (and the reason I haven't returned since) was when I called them to check, they told me they had fresh mozzarella, but when I arrived they \"discovered\" there wasn't actually any there. It's at least 20 minutes for me to get there and I really don't appreciate my time being wasted like that, especially if I bothered to call in advance.   I'd strongly recommend World Harvest on University in Champaign as an alternative. It's cheaper (~$7/lb rather than ~$10+) and they've been much more consistent about having fresh mozzarella available."}
{"text":"Cheese and Crackers is a brand new business run by (I believe) a long-time local, and well-worth the return visit. A deli featuring both artisanal and local items in cheeses and crackers --of course!-- but also chocolates and meats, C&C proprietor Bart is immensely friendly and knowledgeable about the products he carries (and happy to take suggestions, if you've got 'em). Intelligentsia coffee, Audra's Toffee Tales, local honey, Cocopotamus fudges, and artisanal chocolates from Chicago and San Francisco (deliciously displayed in its own case) are among the mix of offerings. Bart is also hoping to offer a small selection of wines in a few months.  I believe Bart can talk about meats all day long, and is happy to try to convert you to his love of meats with plenty of free samples. I had some spiced pork shoulder, some beef thing, some cooked salami, and some black truffle something or another all in short order! And, in the time we spent in the store, we discovered that Cheese and Crackers already has at least one regular on a familiar first-name basis with Bart. Although there is no signage for sandwiches, Bart will make you one --as he did the regular-- with whatever meats and cheeses and other assorted sandwich bits you like (I believe the breads are Pekara, which I'd like to see more of on the other side of the counter!), or if you trust him, one of his own devising!   I miss the downtown Champaign artisanal deli Persimmon --I still miss the delicious sandwiches and gelatos-- so I'm excited and hopeful for Cheese and Crackers!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cheese and Crackers twice now. The owner has been more then helpful both times. He is so excited about food and so informative if you don't know what you want. He suggested this awesome buffalo milk mozzarella to go with the dry Italian sausage we got an it was awesome. This time I went in for a sandwich. They had run out of their baguettes, but instantly offered me another type of bread for my sandwich. I am also pretty sure he added some extras on the sandwich since he didn't have bread. It was awesome! I want to live there. Forever."}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly helpful, even to the point of recommending cheaper alternatives amongst their stock based on previous customer's reviews (I bought some basalmic vinegar and got some advice).  Bought a mix of confectionaries between both the store made chocolates and the imported chocolates and gotta say the in-house chocolates stood up.  The staff knows their stuff and is eager to answer any questions."}
{"text":"Incredibly helpful, knowledgeable and fun people!   I came in looking for something very specific that they didn't happen to have at this time, but they were able to direct me to something similar.   I had read reviews about their fish and, even though I hadn't come in to buy fish, they took time to explain to me what they get in and what the differences are and what makes their quality so special.  I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try the sandwiches here. I ordered the Mindy's Italian. The sandwich has so much potential, however, it did not meet expectations. The sandwich has too much bread and on top of that, the bread was a little tough. The sandwhuch could also use a little more meat. I might try another sandwich at some point just to make sure it wasn't an off day."}
{"text":"Every piece of fish I have eaten from Cheese and Crackers has been delicious and fresh, The fresh fish email list is also extremely convenient. 100% recommended for any seafood lover."}
{"text":"I've been stopping at Cheese & Crackers for close to three years now. It's one of those rare small-town businesses that are easy to become inordinately fond of. There are few other places around that compete with their selection of cheese, certainly. I've noticed that the nearest Schnuck's makes a somewhat dispassionate effort, but Schnuck's selection is more a disorganized trough of cheese miscellany stared down by the gleaming piles of bacon just across the aisle. I've read other reviews that suggest the Art Mart -- I don't really think the competition is there, to be frank, and I can't recommend that anyone without a sturdy constitution take their torch and compass through the relic halls of the Lincoln Square Mall.  If you've looked at the other reviews, you've picked up on a few things -- they can be a bit expensive, they sell far more than just cheese, and they make excellent sandwiches. All of these things are true. They're situated very close to a Subway sandwich shop, a Jimmy John's, and a Panera, but I'm always more than happy to spend a little extra time and money getting a sandwich from them. The ingredients are high-quality and the final product is always delicious. And while I'm waiting for a sandwich to be made, I love perusing all the cheeses, pastas, sauces, teas, coffees, chocolates, cured meats, and other inspiring food-fancier items they've got (they're always adding new stuff, too, which is fun).  Really, the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because there has been some minor inconsistency with sandwiches in the past. I'm not sure if there isn't a standard write-up for how the various sandwiches are made (exact ingredients and at least rough amounts of each), but I've occasionally ended up with 'variations on the theme' that I'd at least like to have been warned of beforehand.  But that's about my only complaint. As long as you don't mind a little waiting now and then and aren't scared off by premium fare, Cheese & Crackers is a great place to check in again and again. In fact, for some meals (principally ones including cheeses and meats), I consider it an indispensable stop."}
{"text":"Awesome place, we were on the mood for some cheese but didn't know what we got great service and bought awesome cheese"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and unusual deli items, and by unusual I mean unusually good. I had a hot ginger soda, my son didn't care for it but I thought it was excellent. The sandwich bread had some major crust that challenged my jaw muscles but the flavor was good. They'd do well to find a different but equally tasty bread that's not so tiring.   They have a nice number of imported items, chocolate, salmon, crackers, and cheese. The staff was nice and knew their product."}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets in town! The staff is extremely helpful and knowledgable about all of their products. My fiance and I recently went in for a cheese plate, and the woman working there allowed us to try all three cheeses before making the tray for us. Delicious! They also offer sandwiches with very fresh meats, cheeses and veggies, and they always have samples out of their cheeses and meats. I have not tried their chocolates, but my parents said they were some of the best they'd ever had. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Knowledgeable and fun cheesemonger. They obviously know and love cheese. It's all quality stuff here and they will let you sample as well. They also carry cured meats, chocolates, and now have a super fresh high end fish program. It's a local store that is a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"I was looking for a great deli in my area, and saw that there were rave reviews about Cheese and Crackers. On this rainy day adventure, I decided to give it a shot. It's a quaint little deli in an outdoor shopping center. Upon entering there's a good selection of boars head meat products, cheese and pops. There's also- you may have guessed, a great variety of crackers. The chocolates were very beautiful and I was highly tempted to devour a selection, yet I was looking for specific deli items that included pasta dishes. I noticed that Cheese and Crackers has a wide range of deli meats and cheese, but not many pasta dishes. After deciding on what to buy I waited at the register with a lady that had been waiting since I arrived at the shop, five minutes later we were both still waiting. I'm not sure what happened, but at this point I made the decision to go elsewhere. Yet I did receive samples of their kalamata olives and some beef meats which were great. I'd love to come back and buy those items as well, but on another occasion; which is why I gave Cheese and Crackers only three stars."}
{"text":"I love this place! Bart and his staff are very knowledgable and very helpful. I love their sandwiches, cheeses and sausages are great! One must to try is the smoked white almonds they are so tasty.   I have ordered multiple orders of fish and every piece has been awesome.  Would recommend the Blue Fin tuna that is my personnel Favorite."}
{"text":"Love trying the cheese here! I try to support them as much as possible but Harvest Market down the street has a lot of the same options for much cheaper. I want to support local business though because places like this are amazing! I wish some of the employees were better at cutting the amount that I want to buy. Sometimes they cut double what I asked for and then say it's hard to get it exact....that doesn't mean I want to pay for double if I don't need it!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I've had the turkey and goat cheese sub and the hot ham sub. They were both incredible. Inside of this specialty foods store, you'll find a huge variety of cheeses, meats, jams, chocolates, candies, and much more. It is small and intimate and usually only one person is working behind the counter. They slice the meat for the sandwiches fresh for each one (so they do take about 10-12 minutes). However, you have plenty to look at while you wait."}
{"text":"I love Cheese and Crackers. I first went there to check out its sandwiches that a friend recommended, but quickly wanted to try everything in the store. The employees there really know their cheese, including suggestions on how to use and serve it. I've bought a couple of boxes of unique chocolate from there for gifts that have been really well received. In addition to cheese and chocolate, there is a large selection of specialty crackers, throwback Pepsi products, Boar's Head deli products, really nice olive oil, and more. My favorite cheese is slightly less expensive here than it is at Art Mart."}
{"text":"Awesome service - friendly and knowledgeable. They have a great variety of cheese, crackers and chocolates. Great place to do holiday shopping or just pick something up for a nice dinner party (or snacking)."}
{"text":"This place has all the cheese, cured meats, and chocolates your could ever want, plus literally the freshest tasting fish I've ever had!"}
{"text":"If you're a home chef, you'll love this place.   It's so much more than cheese or crackers. They have some choice meets, chocolates and some packaged goods.   They also have a sign-up for fresh fish that is flown into Chicago and immediately trucked down. There is also a list of fresh fish that they have available.   Bart is a cornucopia of knowledge with everything in the store, and can even describe exactly what will happen under different cooking conditions with the cheeses. He loves talking with the customers and getting to know them. Clearly the guy likes his job, and it shows.  I was surprised not to see a huge mark-up on the cheese prices. They are high quality. And I was also very happy to get fresh mozzarella instead of something packaged up from one of the local groceries.   And root beer - there are so many choices. That alone makes me happy."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today to kill some time while waiting for the bus. It's a little gold mine for foodies. I think they have every kind of cheese and and deli meat you could want. The guy working there let me try some cheeses and patiently explained what everything was. Apparently cheese can get so salty thats its almost crunchy. Anyway I ended up getting an assorted pack of these obscure sodas that taste awesome. Coke is good but sometimes you want something different and I got plenty of variety."}
{"text":"What a cool little find in downstate IL!  I love, love, love the crusty bread they use for their subs.  They also have top quality cured meats and cheeses.  So many choices.  If you love stinky cheese and salty meats this  place is for you?  Chocolate you ask?  OMG, they have some of the best and most decadent and beautiful chocolate choices I've ever seen.  So wish I lived closer to this place."}
{"text":"I can't comprehend the negative reviews. This isn't a Jimmy Johns, this a gourmet deli. The selection of cheese, cured and fresh meats, and olives is diverse and expansive. The fresh fish is the freshest and highest quality that you'll find within a 100 mi radius  (you have to pre-order). The pantry staples are a little pricey, but where else will you find shaved truffles, authentic Italian riso, etc? (Common ground and world harvest are just as pricey too). I've had nothing but wonderful encounters with the owner and his employees. I look forward to their knowledgeable recommendations whenever I'm feeling something new. I would have never discovered my new favorite table cheese (bulgarian kashkaval) without Bart's suggestions.   i think what I've stated above should be the last word.   But let's engage the more popular complaints.   A) the sandwiches: this isn't a sandwich restaurant, this is a deli. They make sandwiches for your convenience (and to pad their margins lol). All that said, they aren't even bad! I literally can't value the opinion of someone who calls a Cheese and Crackers sandwich  \"the worst in [his/her] life.\" They are highly above average and very creative. Tough bread? O.k. go yell at Pekara bakery!  B) the staff: I've been treated with nothing but respect. I've witnessed the manager \"teaching\" his employee once. It didn't offend me. In fact, he was doing so to provide me better service! I have not seen any loud yelling or w.e.  C) the prices: this isn't county market. You come here to indulge in a treat or to provide yourself with gold standard ingredients. I get my produce and canned goods elsewhere so I can afford my cheeses here. BECAUSE IT'S WORTH IT. When it comes to artisan foods, you get what you pay for. And at Cheese and Crackers what you get is a lot."}
{"text":"So much cheese!!!!  Good selection, lots of cheese I've never heard of some international imports and a few local cheese too.  Loved that they offered samples of everything.  Ended up getting some small cuts of cheese and some Serrano ham.    My overall favorite is the five year aged cheddar.  Oh and wash it down with some Kitty Piddle soda.  Good customer service, I will have to go back and try the chocolates some time soon."}
{"text":"All of the products are good, I love the truffle goat cheese. However some of the staff are just rude. I went there for lunch to get a sandwich, meanwhile two other people came in and ordered as well, the guy behind the counter rolled his eyes and huffed: \"of course your here for lunch, we are surrounded by sandwich shops you have just HAVE to come here\"  I thought that was odd and chimed in, \"this place must be the best\" he just seemed annoyed and said: \"it's really not, but I guess you can do whatever\" I found that so off putting, it was the first time I decided to have a deli sandwich for lunch and although good, it's considerably more expensive than the other options as Panera, JJ, and subway are walking distance. I don't understand why he was so annoyed doing his job and why he would encourage customers to go elsewhere.."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches made with first class ingredients for less than Jimmy Johns? Yes please."}
{"text":"Can I tell you how much we love Cheese & Crackers? We like to stop by on Sundays right when they open (noon) to pick up cheese or cold cuts for the week. They also have fancy chocolates, pastas, and neat old-fashioned sodas in glass bottles. Today we arrived before noon, but because the owner was there already, he let us in and served us. He is very friendly and knowledgeable (the staff are, too). We got two subs (had to have been a foot-long, each) and a bottle of soda for $18.50. We'll be having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! During the week they use bread from Rick's Bakery, and on Saturday's they give some of Rick's pastries. Even if you don't live in SW Champaign, check this place out before you go to Subway or Panera. Support a locally-owned business! Your tastebuds (and Bart) will thank you."}
{"text":"I stop in eveytime I drive in from Chicago. The quality of cheese and deli here incomparable. And the service is amazing, they really go above and beyond. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Modified my previous review after the store owner's thoughtful response to feedback shared. I respect small business owners that put in effort to follow up to feedback shared. After his note, I have gone back to the business and better understand what their focus areas are.   SUMMARY Cheese & Crackers primarily is an order ahead market. The name 'cheese and crackers' is misleading, as what they offer stretches beyond cheese. You can order a range of things like artisanal cheese trays, cured meats to seafood. The trick is to visit their website and sign up for their mailing list. There, you'll get a better feel for the range of products Cheese & Crackers offers on a weekly basis beyond what you just see in-store.   PROS: - Order Seafood: They have a mailing list to order fresh seafood. Sign up on their website. They bring in fresh, high quality seafood from Canada. I went to a dinner party that served fresh salmon from here - was delightful.  - Catering: They are a great fit for catering, in particular artisanal cheese platters and trays.  - Baguette Sandwiches To Go: They serve sandwiches on baguettes like thinly sliced roast beef. - Cheese Assortment: They have an extensive list of featured cheeses.  CONS:  - They don't offer in-store or to-go cheese plates - only order ahead. I would love to be able to stop by, select 3-4 cheeses, take them home to try that evening.  - They have a few bistro tables, but the store footprint is small thus it isn't really a spot to hang out in-store.  - The sandwiches are only served on baguettes, and the baguettes are really tough on your teeth / hard to bite. Would be nice to offer another bread option for sandwiches, as the sandwiches are very tasty."}
{"text":"This is the place for a good selection of cured Italian sausages and ordering fresh seafood! The cheese selection is kind of bizarre and mostly infusions which are not my preference. Never been disappointed with the things I've actually purchased and the staff are really nice."}
{"text":"Stopped on our way back from Nashville for a sandwich and they were great. We got the grilled cheese with truffle,  Turkey sub and a couple of italian subs. Everything was tasty. I will be looking forward to my next travels down 57.  For sure check this gem out."}
{"text":"Was visitng U of I for a weekend, and my friend who'd just gotten back from Barcelona was obsessed with this type of ham called \"Iberico\". I'd never heard of it, but he insisted it was the greatest thing on earth. After a quick google search for stores in the area that had said greatest ham in the world, Cheese and Crackers popped up and we went in to check it out.   I wasn't expecting much when we walked in, kind of just wanted a quick sandwich for lunch, but in the end, we all ended up having a great experience!   The staff was friendly and extremely helpful. We barely knew anything about what we were looking for, but they immediately helped figure it out for us. Turns out the ham we were looking for runs upwards of $150 /lb, but the guys behind the counter offered to make a custom sandwich for us!   We ended up with a few more free samples of some other premium fancy meats, found some cool glass-bottled sodas, and ended up with a great meal.   I've already suggested the place to my friends at U of I, and I'll be sure to visit again next time I'm back!"}
{"text":"When EuroMart switched ownership and became Bombay Bazaar, I lamented over the dwindling cheese counter where I had previously bought my snacks over the weekends.  I later heard about Cheese and Crackers, and I was surprised to see the familiar cheese guy from EuroMart working there (I assume he co-owns the new cheese shop?).  Cheese and Crackers is a much improved version of the cheese counter at the old EuroMart.  They sell the requisite cheeses for which the store is named, but also a broad sampling of meats, chocolates, olive oils, and other items that you might need for an appetizer tray.  The store also attempts to carry some locally-produced items.  Another reviewer commented on the owner's enthusiasm for sharing his fine deli meats.  I've had similar experiences.  One day as I was browsing the case, the owner leaned over and asked, \"Do you eat meat?\"  He then handed me a few shavings of a delightful, smoky prosciutto.  He also generously allows you to sample most of the items in the case, which makes this a great place for cheese novices who might want to experiment before they commit to buying a pound of cheese.  Traffic has been generally slow when I've stopped by, so the owner has always afforded me plenty of attention.  This includes providing advice, describing the short history of his business, and sharing stories about his love of food.  We've discussed restaurants in New York and other prominent cheese delis across the country.  Overall, I was very impressed by his familiarity with his own products and his knowledge of the trade as a whole."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh special order seafood .flown in  . They have made the ordering process so easy . Some great sweets too  bart is very accomodating ."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where if you blink, you'll miss it! Tucked away in a small strip mall where Panera and PNC are located. It's been awhile since I have been back but it's right next to a UPS store.  Obviously from the name, they have TONS of cheese to choose from. They will let you sample anything that might look interesting to you.   They also have an array of little treats and gifts including hot sauce but you'll have to visit more than once because I think they get new stuff all the time!"}
{"text":"One of many delis in Champiagn Urbana where one can find nice meats and cheeses (seriously there are a lot per capita in this town!) What sets this place apart is the deli meat selection.  I would say it's the most extensive of the four 'high end' delis in town.   A year ago I would've given this place a five. I go here for the fish list but have been disappointed too many times lately. I have had my order messed up four times.  Two of the four times they didn't get in what I ordered and made no attempt to contact me to let me know despite the owners insistence that 'somebody should've called you.' When the order is right, the fish can be really good.   Another turn off is the atmosphere.  The owner occasionally berates/yells at the staff with customers present. It can be uncomfortable and makes you feel bad for the employees. Also the fact they accept Bitcoin is kind of obnoxious. Once I went in there and the guy in front of me was trying to use Bitcoin to pay and it was an ordeal."}
{"text":"I stopped by Cheese and Crackers while in town for a conference. The shop had a few cheese samples available, though they seemed as if they'd been sitting out for a while. I ordered the Italian sub which would have been excellent (fresh veggies and delicious Boars Head meat), except for the burnt baguette which was simultaneously too hard to bite into and too chewy to break down easily. The employee who helped me was pleasant and provided service as quickly as could be expected during the late afternoon rush."}
{"text":"The cheese and meat selection (and chocolates) are great and an unexpected surprise in the C-U area. I went in to get a few cheeses for a cheese plate, and they were reasonably priced and delicious.  Overall, they have some great stuff and I will definitely be back to this shop for the cheese selection."}
{"text":"I was really expecting to fall in love with this place. When I called them and asked what types of feta cheese they had, the woman who answered the phone corrected me and said, \"It's pronounced fay-duh.\" I'm Greek - I know how to pronounce feta correctly! But not only that, it's a little rude to correct someone's pronunciation...  I got feta cheese and kalamata olives, thinking that this would be a fantastic way to save a trip to World Harvest in Urbana. The cheese was very low quality - it tasted like it hadn't been in brine for a long time, which is really important for feta! The olives were \"meh.\" We decided the trip to World Harvest is worth it, but we'll keep Cheese & Crackers in mind for the future."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, and I'm rounding up to 4 to be fair, because there are some very good things here. Just not as much as you would think. I get the feeling this is a place that thrives on being highly-priced. In other words, people assume it's the best because of their prices. Their seafood looks okay, I guess. Maybe you have to order it special to really judge their quality. Everything on display looks no better than in grocery stores.  Their sandwiches are probably the best thing about this place.  Their cheese selection is slightly above-average. The staff, every time I've gone in, has been less than helpful. If you have the vaguest question (i.e. - \"What do you like?\") then maybe they know their stuff, but I've honestly received answers like \"Well, they're all cheeses\" when asking for differences between options or questions about where the cheeses are sourced. Not trying to be a cheese snob, but when the first word in your name is \"Cheese\", you should have more than surface information about your products.  Come here for sandwiches and a large(ish) variety of cheese. Go to Art Mart if you want knowledgeable staff, high-end ingredients and/or information on where everything comes from."}
{"text":"Getting on the Cheese and Crackers fish email list was probably one of the best decisions I've ever made! Every other day, I get an email about how to order the freshest fish possible in Champaign. They do a great job to source only sustainable fish and they have a huge selection of sushi grade options. I went with a pound of Canadian salmon & while I was there, I couldn't resist picking up a small box of chocolate. I was a little disappointed that the chocolate wasn't sourced from a local chocolatier but nonetheless, it was delicious and beautiful!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. When my husband and I have had a rough week, we usually end it by coming here, getting some great cheese, prosciutto and craft root beer. I would give them 5 stars but there is one man (i actually think he's the owner) who doesn't make the experience fun. Everyone else that works there is so nice and helpful but he usually acts like you're bothering him..."}
{"text":"I would transplant this shop back with me to California if I could.  Cheese and Crackers is, indeed, cheese and crackers, but also oh so much more.  Let's start with the cheese: I am no cheese connoisseur, but oh my, their cheese is delicious.  In fact, it is so good that I have been desperately canvassing southern California (which is where I am currently at) for cheeses that might just kind of sort of match up with their cheeses (so far, no luck).  And the staff doesn't care if you're if highly educated cheese-ologist or culinary-ily challenged med student (ahem, yours truly): they're friendly, sincerely passionate and excited about their goods, and more than happy to let you sample whatever cheeses you'd like.  (Tip: try their manchego, aged 12 months, with a bit of their wildflower honey.  SO.  GOOD.)  Next, the crackers...which segues us into the kinda sorta related delectable artisan chocolates (okay fine, they're not related.  So their crackers: very nice.  On to the chocolate!!)  They have an entire section crammed full of chocolates of every flavor and persuasion imaginable.  They are also, admittedly, not cheap.  Those who don't feel like spending a few dollars per piece of chocolate can instead indulge in the multitude of Cocopotamus truffles that they also sell ($10 for 5 pieces, which, at $2 a pop, is still less expensive than some of their fancier chocolates, but depending on which you get, arguably just as delicious).  Besides cheese and crackers/chocolates, they also carry meats, pastas, and other delicious miscellany (local honeys, exotic sodas, sea salts, etc).  So if you are ever in need of any of the above mentioned culinary delights, definitely give Cheese and Crackers a try!"}
{"text":"After seeing the local news video on their webpage and reading about the hubbub praising their Italian sandwich, I had to come try it for myself. I'm not from Champaign, but do drive into the city every so often on the weekends to try out various restaurants/eateries.  The Italian sandwich was delicious. The veggies are chopped and the salami is sliced when you order it. This makes a tangible, taste-able difference. You can tell a lot of thought went into selecting the ingredients and ratios of ingredients for an exceptional-tasting sandwich, too. The vinaigrette was something special. The baguette was crusty and delicious. (Can't have a terrific sandwich without terrific bread.)  I got the sandwich to go and was eating it in my car. Upon finishing it, I was feeling mildly bummed that the sandwich was consumed. And so I did what any reasonable man would do - I promptly U-turned and went back for 2nd one.  I do want to mention that the young lady who helped me and made my sandwich (both times) was really kind. She greeted me as soon I walked in the door. And although I knew exactly what I wanted, I appreciated that she offered to answer any questions I had, and even recommended another sandwich that I might also like. When I went back the second time, she was again welcoming and remembered me.  I also wanted to mention that even as I was waiting for my sandwich to be made, a gentleman (I believe the owner?) also promptly tended to me to make sure I was already being helped.  Really like this place and will definitely be back to check out some of their other products. Wish I lived closer and wish my hometown had a place like this!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place. I got some delicious feta cheese and they were good on describing the differences between the two (Bulgarian and Greek), and I chose the Bulgarian. It's a bit more tangy and has a creamy texture because it's made with sheep milk. Though there was probably a bit of tension because of a previous review based on the feta cheese (kind of apparent, but I appreciated the clarification).  It's in a good location and they have such a diverse selection. Unfortunately, the chocolates were a bit underwhelming. I got both Patricia's Chocolates and Norman chocolate I believe. I tried 3 types of Patricia's Chocolates and I wasn't sure if it was just old, or not well-made but there were no distinctive flavors of the chocolates. The habanero/chipotle had no extra spice flavoring, the pear caramel was also just plain, and the banana rum caramel was okay, but not amazing. I guess I've tasted really great chocolates before (Cocoa Bella, Mariebelle, etc; a few at the NYC Chocolate Show), and I've been really amazed before. But for $3 a piece, I'm expecting some sort of distinctive flavoring. Even with the spicier chile chocolates, I'm okay with a little spice but there was barely any note of spice. So disappointed. I'm not really sure where to find my chocolate fix in Champaign, but I'll probably have to order online from somewhere else. And to edit/ the Normal chocolate was good. I got a New York Cheesecake truffle which was really nice."}
{"text":"My personal pet peeve - when you walk into a business and you are not acknowledged. I'd be willing to wait for the \"world's best sandwich\" if I only knew that someone was going to eventually get around to asking me what I would like. It's really not that difficult to say \"I'll be right with you\" - this acknowledges that they realize you are there and are both wanting to assist you and willing to assist you.  There were two people working and one was working with a couple and I was the only other person in sight. But perhaps that is the problem because the store is a cluttered mess.  One could assume that is what the bell over the door is for - so that they know someone's entered their shop and can provide assistance in allowing you to spend your money.  Not worth the effort- driving down to the Art Mart.  Won't let me give a Zero which is the experience I had and won't return.  See 5 star review for Art Mart."}
{"text":"Restaurant review This is sort of a hybrid restaurant/store review. I've been meaning to visit this place for a long time after seeing the review of the day. It's a very small deli shop that also makes fresh sandwiches. I was surprised by the selection of cheese that they had. The menu is rather limited with only a few sandwiches. They do prepare these fresh on the spot. The price of the sandwich is about $6-$7. I had the Italian sandwich which is similar to the one at to Jimmy John's. It does come on a baguette. It was good but for the price paid I thought there would be more meat. In terms of their store, they have a large selection of cheese and you can sample some for free. They had a small display case for chocolates which seem quite pricey. Also there's a limited selection of fresh fish, but the prices close to $20 a pound. For seating there is one small table inside and a few outside, but you're likely to take your sandwich to go. For me this is a one-time experience.  Pros: Large selection of cheeses, high-end meat cuts  Cons: Very expensive, small parking lot  Hidden deals: Free samples of various cheeses on the counter daily  Health code rating: A. Very clean and well maintained. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1501"}
