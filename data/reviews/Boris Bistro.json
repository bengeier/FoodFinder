{"text":"This was the best meal we had during our week in Montreal. The shaded terrasse was wonderful during the heat wave. All 5 of us loved our food--we had the chilled leek soup, tuna a la boris, duck risotto, grilled scallops, beef sirloin, and neapolitan tagliatelle--and we ate every morsel. The kids fought over my soup and I should have ordered another bowl because they ate it all. Our favorites were probably the seared tuna and the beef which was cooked perfectly (my son was able to cut it with his butter knife because he didn't notice the steak knife) but everything was excellent."}
{"text":"Okay, here's the schpiel on Boris Bistro. You go there because they have the nicest patio in Montreal. You're also pleasantly surprised their staff is genuinely friendly and don't hurry up to grab your plates or come ask you \"How everything is\" too often (sorry, but there is such a thing as overdoing good service). You sit at your table and realise something's different - and amost odd! You can hear yourself think! You can even have a conversation! That's because the Boris Bistro patrons aren't blasting music to distract from their food, cause they don't need to. But, I digress. The reason I really wanted to write this review is to talk to you about their Cold Poblano Pepper Soup. It's soup that could easily be served at a three-star Michelin Restaurant. The flavors are balanced, the spicy peppers don't overpower you - they tease you and perfectly marry the cold wave of pleasure that kicks in shortly afterwards. I gave this restaurant 5 stars because to me, very few restaurants in Montreal can offer this level of ambiance and service and still make great tasting food at a very affordable price. My only critique would be the salmon tartare, which is a bit bland and under seasoned by my standards. Always fresh though! Props on presentation too, I love the black stone plates."}
{"text":"we had a wonderful dinner.  The food was very good, the service was outstanding and the ambience was simply superb. overall, it was also reasonably priced.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Tough call. I'm stuck literally between a 3 and 4. 

The ambience was exactly what we needed on a serene summer day and the food was good enough, but in the context of Montreal it was just ok. 
 
Boris Bistro is located on Rue McGill and hosts an outdoor terrace that transports you to a secret garden in the middle of a bustling city. This earns them 4, maybe 5 stars as it is the perfect respite for a relaxing lunch, brunch, or dinner.

The menu holds its own in a city like Montreal with offerings such as bison tartare, lamb shank and duck confit sandwich just to name a few. The drinks were solid and they have happy hour specials on the beer (it leaves much to be desired but at least they offer something).  I tried their sangria which was good, my friend had one of their cider beers (she seemed less than amused), and the boys got a sparkling red wine which was delicious. They score a 3/4 on drinks. 

My party started out with the charcuterie plate which disappeared almost as quickly as it arrived. It was a tough call for me between the duck sandwich, the risotto, and the fish offering (I forget what it was), but I'm a sucker for duck (done right) so I went with that.  I have to say, I don't think I've experienced duck quite like that before. I imagined something shredded, succulent and flavorful in between 2 pieces of bread... at least it was shredded.   It wasn't a bad experience, it was just different. The duck was served almost in a waldorf chicken salad style over sprouts in between 2 slices of a nut bread.  It was enormous with a more than generous amount of duck. The combination worked, especially the nut bread...I just wasn't what I expected so I was slightly disappointed.  I wouldn't get it again, just from personal preference. 

My friend ordered the lamb shank, and lets just say the next thing we knew all that was left was a bare bone, so I guess that was good! The other 2 ordered the bison tartare which they said was good but I didn't get an \"out of this world\" vibe from them. The food is a 3-4.

In a different city, this may earn a much higher rating but with so many other options in Montreal, the main reason to come here is their cozy outdoor terrace on a beautiful summer day (maybe for drinks and apps)."}
{"text":"French Fries fried in duck fat.  Need I say more?  Oh, and cute waiters too.

Fantastic patio spot for lunch that's mostly local young professionals.  Great wines by the glass.  I had an amazing duck confit sandwich with thinly sliced celery and apple on sliced bread that I believe had chestnuts in it.  Really unique and delicious.  

Did I mention the duck fat french fries?"}
{"text":"beautiful outdoor garden, real yummy food.. attentive + polite hostess/servers..

we got mushroom cappucino w/ rosemary (best soup I've ever tasted!)
yes, fries in duck fat here is super famous! and foie gras nem is a very cute yummy reinvention of this delicacy in spring roll version for people who can't engulf the whole fatty liver @ one sitting.. 
beef tartar looks almost identical to the one I got from Paris, it's good overall (just too many capers for my taste)... 

creme brulee is sooooo good. yummy melt in your mouth..  i'm from boston and it's 100X better than the ones from petit robert (always too eggy).

perfect for before/after light show @ notre dame.."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Boris Bistro so much during our first trip to Montreal that we made it a point to go back the next time we visited this month.  The patio was open and it was a beautiful evening highlighted with excellent food, great cocktails and excellent service.  My only issue is that it is a 6 hour car ride from where I reside!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect...!!!  We had fries cooked in duck fat with a great sauce to complement it.  The rack of veal was tender, moist and the balance of flavor was phenomenal, perfectly executed.  The snail feuilleté had a very rich and creamy sauce that was so good that we used the basket of bread to scoop up every last drop on the plate.  All of this for a very reasonable price.  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant. We walked by looking for lunch on a Monday and saw this beautiful outdoor seating area. Because we didn't have reservations, we sat inside but it was still nice. It seems many businesses host lunches there during the week. I would highly recommend making reservations.

The foie gras, warm salad (string bean salad) with shrimp, and red tuna steak were all very good."}
{"text":"Peperonata, mascarpone fritter, goat cheese appetizer was very refreshing (yummy peppers) and Red Tuna Boris Style was very good. Recommend outdoor seating when you visit - beautiful terrasse makes for great ambience! Good cocktails as well - had the Boris style mojito."}
{"text":"We found this place randomly while walking around... From the outside didn't look anything special until we saw the internal garden! 

The service was great! You need to try the duck risotto! Also the maple creme brulee and the chocolate cake with salted caramel!!"}
{"text":"I went here for a hangover brunch with 4 friends after a bachelor party.  We were pleasantly surprised by the amazing patio (on a 75 degree day).  The fresh and diverse menu was the perfect complement to the traditional bistro feel.  I had the grilled salmon, served on top of a vibrant spinach salad, and it was great.  The only thing that wasn't great was the wait - at least an hour.  Our waiter was very friendly though, and all the staff in general were very congenial.  Definitely go here on a nice day and order some appetizers!"}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, great service. Food is ok"}
{"text":"Sehr schönes Restaurant, das auch bei den Montrealern sehr beliebt ist!


 (Lustige Geschichte: Wir haben das Restaurant nur durch Zufall entdeckt, gleichzeitig mit uns kam ein Fahrradpolizist am Eingang zum Innenhof an. Wir haben etwas verwirrt geschaut, weil wir erst dachten, er hätte wegen uns gehalten. 
Nachdem geklärt war, dass wir hier nur essen wollen und sonst keine Probleme haben, hat er uns zu unserer guten Wahl beglückwünscht und uns erzählt, dass er hier regelmäßig und immer wieder voller Begeisterung isst.
Ich denke, das ist das erste Restaurant, dass mir von einem Polizisten explizit empfohlen wurde )


 Das Besondere an diesem Restaurant  abgesehen vom guten Essen  ist, dass man im Hof direkt hinter der alten Häuserfront sitzt. Es wurde dort quasi ein Haus abgerissen, aber die Fassade stehen gelassen. Das Restaurant selbst hat eine Glasfront zu diesem Innenhof, die im Sommer vollständig weggeklappt wird: Man sitzt also auch im Restaurant irgendwie doch draußen. Und auch wenn man draußen sitzt gibt es doch noch ein dicke, burgähnliche Wand zur Straße, die den Straßenlärm abhält.


 Wenn man mit der Familie unterwegs ist, sollte man allerdings beachten, dass man unter 18 nur in den Hof darf  und dan auch nur bis 20 Uhr. Das liegt wohl an den etwas strengeren kanadischen Gesetzen zum Alkoholausschank."}
{"text":"Slow service. Forgetful waiters. Lack luster food. Also 18 and over rule is pretty stupid. The menu is really meh and for the price, not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here not for the food, but to relax on the terrasse and have a few drinks. 

Service was incredibly slow on a day that wasn't even busy. Cocktails were over sweet with not enough alcohol in them, not to mention overpriced. 

The waitress also brought our bill out with our drinks, and returned every 5 minutes asking if we were ready to pay. Not a place I would return to."}
{"text":"I'll be honest. We had just arrived in town and were looking for lunch. I had decided to go to Holder and walked past this place thinking this was it. No sign, no name on the menu, just a beautiful outdoor patio. So after we were seated, we slowly realized we were in the wrong place. Oh well, menu looked good, and it was a nice shady spot on a hot summer afternoon, so we decided to stay. We ordered a pitcher of sangria (24$) to start. It was fresh, juicy, nicely chilled, and HUGE! Enough to serve a party of four. We ordered the foie gras nem starter (13.50$). It is a large piece of foie gras, wrapped in phyllo dough and deep fried like a spring roll.  As you bite into it, the melted foie gras oozes out. The cider reduction balances the richness with sweet acidity. It was delicious, but somewhat challenging to eat. For mains, I had the venison sausage (17$). It came with a generous portion of duck fat frites, with the house special mayo. The sausage was tasty, not over seasoned, but a bit dry and dense. The fries were excellent: crisp, not greasy. My wife had the grilled salmon salad(17.75$). Unfortunately she felt that the fish was overcooked and did not taste fresh, and the salad was overdressed with onions. Service was fast and attentive. Overall, I think Boris Bistro is a great place to enjoy drinks and have a decent meal, but come here for the patio and the ambiance, not the food."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful, unfortunately the chairs in the patio are extremely uncomfortable and the plates are expensive enough. 

The drinks are great, I loved lichee martini."}
{"text":"Le Boris Bistro offre une terrasse incroyable dans le Vieux-Montréal. Les prix sont raisonnables et la nourriture assez bonne, par contre, aucun Wow! Superbe option pour les gros groupes. Les cocktails pourraient être plus généreux."}
{"text":"No better way to take a break from walking the city on a hot day than to spend some time in their shady courtyard. Stopped in for a mid-afternoon snack and had the selection of cured meats and a couple of Boris Blancs. Staff was exceptionally friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious food, romantice setting. The portions of food were just right. I had the warm lamb with grilled veggies. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Food was good, took 120 minutes for food to Arline.  Waiter was extremely apologetic, food, when arrived was lukewarm, not bad, but not worth the wait.  On the plus side, the mojitos were very good, and they comped us dessert due to the wait.  May have been because the weather was so lovely, but no excuse, really"}
{"text":"awesome venue, nice place to have a drink or ten on a summer night... but the food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Boris bistro differs from other restaurant in the old port area as they offer a cute terrace , well built and lit for summer nights. 
As a result , the restaurant offers a quiet and romantic dinner or business dinners ;) 

As for the food , I really enjoyed my rabbit as I got to eat a bunny that was roasted for hours along with brocolis that was served in their sauce that was house made. I could also argue that the plate was pretty small and it doesn't really fill you up 100% but I guess you'll still get to enjoy the great quality of the food .

My partner had the risotto , which was able to fill her up and based on her comments , she really appreciated it.

Last thing , the lemon juice is literally house made and is probably a necessary drink if one is thirsty during one of the epic hot day of Montreal ."}
{"text":"Outdoor seating is gorgeous. Decent food, attentive staff. Business crowd."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour un 5 à 7 de bureau et je ne peux pas dire que j'ai été impressionné. J'essaie autant que possible d'être positif, alors commençons avec les fleurs. La terrasse est jolie et l'intérieur aussi. Le choix de bières est correct.

Mon expérience n'était pas complète (je n'ai pas mangé de repas complet), alors je ne peux pas donner des points sur la bouffe. Et c'est peut-être ça qui ferait monter la note. Et si je voulais être plus juste, j'y retournerais et je mettrais mon avis à jour par la suite. Je doute cependant que cela arrive à cause du pot.

Le pot, donc. Nous avions réservé pour un groupe de 20. Au final, nous étions 21. Un problème qui, à première vue (la terrasse était vide à l'heure où nous sommes arrivés), n'était pas insolvable. Pourtant, le propriétaire nous a expliqué que pour réduire le bruit et en raison d'une entente avec les voisins, il ne pouvait nous permettre d'être 21 à une même grande table sur la terrasse. Nous devions soit séparer notre groupe en deux soit aller à l'intérieur à une table de 22. En a suivi une longue discussion entre les organisateurs du 5 à 7 et le propriétaire, qui a refusé de plier, malgré le fait que nous étions un groupe de personnes plutôt calmes (pas exactement l'équipe de football de l'Université McGill, si vous voyez ce que je veux dire). 

Un petit groupe de trois d'entre nous est allé s'asseoir à l'écart le temps qu'un des 18 autres quitte pour aller prendre son train de banlieue (15 minutes plus tard). Les trois exclus (on se croirait à une émission de téléréalité) se sont alors joints à notre groupe. Mais, franchement, à mon humble avis, cette mésaventure était du vrai vaudeville et pas très orientée client comme approche.

Bref, je vais peut-être donner une seconde chance à l'endroit, mais l'attitude intransigeante et même assez hautaine du patron ne m'y encourage pas particulièrement. On verra..."}
{"text":"Really good spot in old Montreal.  The $$ is a stretch, I'd put it more at the $$$ level but it's totally worth it.  Friendly staff and great atmosphere.  The grilled Bison was fantastic, arguably better than any steak filet I've ever had."}
{"text":"Excellent accueil mais attention si l'on veut être en terrasse, il faut réserver obligatoirement.
Il faut dire que les belles et chaudes journées sont privilégiés de tous ici.
Cuisine très agréable et il y en a pour tous les goûts.
Mérite le détour quand on passe ici.
Bon rapport qualité prix aussi, y compris en boisson."}
{"text":"We had great family friends from Australia that we were proudly showing around Montreal. We had a fantastic evening on the patio. As they concluded their world tour, they remarked how much they loved Montreal and enjoying a delicious dinner outside was a real treat. The service and food were excellent. Merci and thank you for an incredible evening and making it a highlight of their visit,"}
{"text":"Excellent French cuisine with a very nice outdoor urban jungle feel seating area. They have a wonderful menu with reasonable prices. Waitstaff were super friendly and provided excellent recommendations!"}
{"text":"La terrasse est exceptionnelle en été ! Agréable et jolie vous pourrez y passer un très agréable moment autant en couple qu'à plusieurs.

J'y suis allée à chaque fois le soir, les assiettes sont belles et assez généreuses. C'est aussi agréable pour un 5@7 car vous pouvez choisir plusieurs de leurs entrées et donc les partager.

Je n'ai jamais été déçu autant sur les plats que sur le service. Mais c'est un restaurant qui reste un peu plus cher que la normale.

Je le recommande fortement surtout l'été !"}
{"text":"Dined at Boris bistro with two kids in tow. It was about 7 pm and we were famished. The maître d explained to us quite nicely that if we were going to eat at the restáurant, then we had to be out by 8 pm due to their liquor license. Since we were tired and hungry, we said that an hour was enough. They seated us in their beautiful garden patio and our waitress, without rushing us, took our orders. She got our orders of duck risotto, grilled lamb and tagliatelle out fast. The food was simply amazing and the service was fantastic! The duck risotto, in particular, was so good that it might have ruined other risottos for me. This bistro certainly beats the fine dining restaurant we were at the other night, in terms of food and service. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor seating.  Perfect with a nice glass of wine. The food was average...the portion sizes were really small, and not worth the $$$.  Had the sage ravioli, and the grilled salmon; both of which were average.  

The service was very friendly and the atmosphere was great.  Other than that, nothing too memorable."}
{"text":"Amazing steak. The atmosphere outdoors is lovely. A sure place to go if you're looking for a more sophisticated outing."}
{"text":"This is my favourite terrasse in the summer, I simply love the courtyard.
The parasols are wonderful and depending on which table you are at, you can sometimes even sit outside when it rains.
The food is tasty and they impressed me by having a vegan dish which tastes delicious - it would be nice to see a bit more variety as I returned a few times in a row and it had remained the same. 
Service is excellent. Ambiance is very nice. It is a perfect spot for a summer lunch or dinner. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"J'aime depuis toujours ce lieu. Non seulement la terrasse est unique, mais le menu varié l'est tout autant; végé, sans gluten bienvenus. Quant à moi, je ne me lasse pas de la salade méditerranéenne. J'ai été ravi par le tataki de buf à la péruvienne, nouveau au menu cette saison. J'apprécie tout autant la présence de son propriétaire-maître d'hôtel, Jean-Marc Lebeau qui veille sur ses hôtes comme s'ils était tous ses amis depuis toujours."}
{"text":"We went there because we were intrigued by the look of the place and ended up finding one of our favorite spot.
I can only speak for the drinks that we had (which were delicious) and regret that we had plans for dinner.

The place is nice (especially outside for the summer !), products are fresh, but more than anything the service is incredible. 
We will be back !"}
{"text":"Boris Bistro in Montreal. Was horrible My gurlfrind started with a chicken salad and it contained 3 leaves of lettuce and the chicken was non existent they tried to make up for the non salad salad and subsititude sevetal leaves of lettuce and nothing else I ordered  A Johnnie Walker Black straight up and maybe it was a half a shot Then for my main course I had a lamb dish that was breaded it was the worst lamb I ever had. All in all I would not ever recommend this place. Only plus the tomato soup was decent. Oh yes in addition my girlfriends wine had very sparce alcholol in it It wS cut with juice."}
{"text":"Great casual place with upscale food.  Very nice and fresh tasting authentic Quebec food.  French fries are incredible.  Kid friendly in the terrasse.  Decent service."}
{"text":"Absolutely Terrible service, and this highly effected my review because my friend and i didnt even want to order a real meal. 

 I cant explain how bad it was. we basically stood around confused if we should sit ourselves, then finally a hostess came  by and sat us.Waitress took forever to bring us water, didnt bring plates or utensils, and took almost an hour to bring over a soup, app, and i think a salad. Also, once seated we had to wait about 15 mins to even get menus. i get it, im from NY and im impatient, but it seemed really poorly organized here...everyone was basically sitting around for awhile. the tomatoe soup felt like it wasnt a soup and was actually marinara. Delicous marinara but it wasnt a soup. The froie gras was delicious, but barely came with bread to put it on. Trying to get even a glass of water here was difficult, and what felt more impossible was asking for some bread. It was just so slow, un organized, and our server seemed like she didnt know what she was doing. There were plenty of waitors, some empty tables, so i have no idea why this place has people running around like theyre not sure what theyre doing."}
{"text":"Excellent! Food is outstanding and so is the service. Jessica our Waitress was very sweet and on the ball.
We had the steak tartare, shrimp risotto and filet mignon.  Everything was delicious.
A bit pricey but worth it every penny."}
{"text":"One word: Amazing amazing amazing !!!! The terrace is very European and big, so if you are a large group its great. You always have to reserve in advance because its always full outside. You can just grab a drink of you want, but I really recommend the food. Love the presentation, very fancy and high class. I had the parpadelle with bore amazing !! Really recommend this place. It is very unique"}

Plats gouttus, service raffiné, décoration chaleureuse! 
Un vrai petit plaisir d'y faire un tour!"}

Ambiance ****  The Boris Bistro is a very nice place to dine, especially out side on their patio"}
{"text":"Great lunch. Had the table d'hôte for about 23 can$. The salmon tartare with french fries was fresh and very tasty, and the soup du jour with sourdough bread unbelievable.  Very friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Your typical trendy Montreal restaurant. Hi on flash low on service, quality, and elegance. Our table was not ready when we arrived. After some scrambling we got seated. The crowd that night was mixed. There were the required number of beautiful people, but also had some what appeared to be office groups which were quite loud. We sat in the terrace area which is pleasant at night. I stared at a busy spider constructing his intricate web while I waited for my cocktail which took forever to come. The servers were polite, courteous, too young and are just that, servers. At that price point i would expect a more professional staff. My cocktail got messed up not once but twice and the waitress never offered a complimentary one; Real rookie stuff. Again at this price point one should expect more. The meal was satisfactory, the portions were however small. Overall, the terrace area was pleasant and the weather was nice so overall our experience was OK. operationally, things could be quicker, the staff could be more seasoned. The place probably won't be there next year.

PS:  I wrote this review July 29, 2013.  The fact that the resto is still opened, is a testament to the low standards Montreal has come to accept."}
{"text":"What a delightful dinner!  I need first note, that if you plan to dine with children, you may only do so on the terrace (which is lovely) and must be seated before 6 PM (as you must be finished and departed by 8 PM per their bar license.  OK, to the review!  EAT HERE!  It was fantastic!  One of the better meals we have had in a long time.  The menu was creative and the service outstanding.  The Grilled lamb fillet, tzatziki, cauliflower tabbouleh was perfectly cooked and the cauliflower tabbouleh such a creative, non-grain side.  The Mediterranean chicken plate (think a chicken Greek salad-but SO much more) was THE PERFECT dish for a warm night on the terrace.  I believe they must poach the chicken before finishing on the grill because it was much to moist to have been fully grilled.  The salad is Canadian style (of course) with lots of veggies (rather than American style with lots of lettuce) and a creamy feta dressing rounded it off.  The Tagliatelle with napolitan sauce was light and delicious.  You MUST save room for dessert.  Skip the White chocolate and fresh rasberries nem, ice cream which is a 1/2 cigar sized spring roll filled with white chocolate and raspberries-OK but nothing special.  However, you will be glad you ordered the Cheese ice cream, guava sauce-it is amazing!  The ice cream is made with fontina cheese, but taste and texture wise, maybe mascarpone?  The guava sauce gives a fruit tangy contrast-wow! And make sure you try one of their snazzy cocktails-I particularly enjoyed the Mojito Boris.  This is a very happening place, lots of locals, so if you can, make a reservation."}
{"text":"Service amazing wine selection good French fries was average but a good place to stop and talk. I would stop."}
{"text":"Outdoor seating in a secret garden! At first sight you are blown away by the location and you keep praying to yourself  \"I hope the food is as good\". And it is!. One of the nicest hidden gems in Montreal, open late."}
{"text":"Amazing french cuisine, had the charcuterie board + foie gras which was very good, and the rabbit as a main, also amazing. The only thing I would recommend is upping the amount of bread/charcuterie ratio!"}
{"text":"This is quite the hot spot in Montreal. This was our second time at this restaurant and so glad to see they are going on strong. This place has a wonderful atmosphere with fashionable folks from Montreal. Wonderful drinks and lunch entrees."}
{"text":"Since us Montrealers are forced to hibernate for much of our long winters, the summer time is when we regain consciousness and park ourselves at the best terrasses Montreal has to offer. Boris Bistro is one of those places, with a great ambiance and a charming hidden terrasse that gives you a feel of the classic novel and film, \"The Secret Garden.\" 

It can get really busy, so don't expect quick service at all times, but the staff makes up for it with their friendly and accommodating demeanor. I've eaten lunch here before and it was great, but I prefer to come for the Bistro's extensive cocktail and wine list."}
{"text":"This place is getting 2 stars for the atmosphere on the terrace. Unfortunately the food and service were very disappointing. Our waiter, Eduardo, took our order and only came back to deliver the food. Not once before or during our meal, did he come back to refill our water or see how things were. Other tables received bread, which was complimentary, but our table did not. I ordered the vegetarian dish- celeriac root with cashew purée. The portion size was literally that of a starter. The 2 pieces of celeriac root were covered in a soup like sauce with cashew purée on the side and a small arugula salad on the top. The cashew purée felt out of place with the other stuff on the plate and did not seem like a composed dish."}
{"text":"Boris Bistro is fun, and it really is bistroesque. They have  a wonderful patio to sit outdoors during the summer months.  I've found also during the summer exclusively they offer a table d'hôte service during lunch.  If it is a nice day out, I'd make a reservation.

I'm a repeat customer for lunch.  My favorite dish is the salmon tartar.  You get two distinct variations with some baguette.  I've also tried the duck risotto which is extremely tasty as well.

It's a bit slow, so don't go if you are in a hurry.    Even though it is a bit sluggish, the food is delicious and the service is friendly.

Lunch will run about $20 per person."}
{"text":"Stopped by and got a 3 course meal for 31 dollars excluding tax and tip. The French onion soup was delicious albeit a bit salty. The poutine was great and dessert was decent. Great place."}
{"text":"Lovely place with good solid bistro food. Very reasoable prices. Great place for a date in the summer. Great patio, but some smokers."}
{"text":"One of the most pleasant restaurant experiences I've ever had, and no, I am not affiliated with Boris Bistro in any way! I'm just a happy tourist from New York City, specifically Brooklyn!

Duck fat fries were on me and my friend's mind as we made our way back to Old Montreal on our last night in this elegant Canadian city, resolving not to leave until we've tried Boris Bistro's legendary fries. But they paled compared to the service: our waitress was extremely nice and even though we only had 2 glasses of wine, 2 beers, and duck fat fries, she kept on checking to see if everything was all right and let us stay for two hours, never made us feel rushed, and even offering snuggies (available for all their customers) when it got a little chilly!! All I kept thinking about was: joie de vivre! This is what life is about: enjoying wine, good company, great conversation, great setting- outdoors underneath umbrellas and trees with chirping birds- and duck fat fries!

I wish I could rave and rave about the fries, they were great, but nothing out of the ordinary. Crispy and firm, with a bit of mayonnaise, each fry was delish, but I couldn't figure out how they differed from regular french fries other than the name. Yet I'm not backing down from my 5-star rating because my Boris Bistro review takes the whole package into consideration, and the whole package was an early birthday present wrapped up in elegant wrapping paper and a pretty ribbon tied with great care.

I left Boris Bistro and Montreal absolutely glowing!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Boris Bistro on a gorgeous Friday afternoon.  They had pulled out all the chairs and tables for a patio night and we took advantage of it.  We didn't have a reservation, but got really lucky and scored a darling table.  Music was subtle but the place was lively anyway.  My friend and I ordered a few apps and drinks.  I had the Boris Mojito...I don't know what was in it, but it was nice, but not strong enough.  (Note:  I've never had a strong cocktail outside of the US, and this was no exception, What's the deal?).  I ordered the Boris Poutine, duck fat fries, whisky sauce and guinea fowl.  It was good, but not my favorite poutine.  My friend had the caponatta and it was fresh and delicious.  Service was friendly, ambiance was great and the patio was lovely.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent outdoor oasis in the middle of the city. The food was good - fries cooked in duck fat, yummm - and the service was pleasant, but its the outdoor patio that makes this place special. Great for an afternoon umbra on a hot day."}
{"text":"I went here when I was traveling for work. The food quality exceeded expectations and was the best meal I had during my weeklong trip. From the presentation to the food quality - all was meticulously prepared. Further, the atmosphere felt so French! Felt like I was back in France. Highly recommend if you're in the area. The filet was the best choice of the meals we ordered."}
{"text":"Restaurant was recommended by the concierge at Intercontinental (Gerry) after a long work day. 

We had both risottos (duck and scallop) as well as the salmon tartar. All dishes were delicious! Dessert was a chocolate, salted caramel plate of amazing! 

Impeccable service, great food, great atmosphere. 

Will definitely be back and can't wait to enjoy the beautiful terrasse in the summer."}
{"text":"Hmm....

Where to start. I was recommended to go to this place by my partner in crime. She said the ambiance is lovely and the terrace is beautiful. I must admit the atmosphere is quite nice. You feel as though you're indoors yet outdoors. I think the terrace was less floral because of the extremely hot summer we had this year. But other than that, there was lots of green. 

My dish was salmon tartare and it came with fries. I enjoyed it. Not one of the best salmon tartares I've had, but it was still a good eat. My boyfriend's dish on the other hand was more expensive and more disappointing. A mahi mahi that was served slightly cold. He only liked the potato slices that were undermeath, not the main attraction of the plate. What really disappointed me was the popular chips with duck fat. We decided to order it to go because we wanted to see what the hype was all about. Almost everyone around us had those chips.  Instead we got totally ripped off with only a small bowl of chips that tasted almost burnt.  5$ for those chips...I've never spent so much money on chips in my life.

I give this place a 3 because my dish was ok, my boyfriend's dish was really not ok, and the chips were a total rip off. But I liked the atmosphere so I give it an ok rating

I wouldn't go back, just for drinks maybe."}
{"text":"This place has unique atmosphere as its \"face\" is a left-over of what was a building before. I really liked it. Service was kind and nice. Food was not bad, but not much impressive either. I would like to visit again to try Tarte here because it seemed like one of the most famous menu here as I saw so many people ordering it."}
{"text":"I was so attracted to Boris Bistro the minute we walked by on our first night out in Montreal.  It looked like an old building that had nothing left but the facade, where through a gate you can see a courtyard full of chairs, tables and giant umbrellas confined by the two tall buildings on each side.  The night is serene, lights twinkling, if I had to pick a perfect summer dining setting, this would be it.

So the second night we tried to retrack our steps to find Boris Bistro again, which was somewhat difficult without having read the name the first night.  When we found it, we were delighted to hear that they had available tables. 

I had the trout salad with walnuts and spinach, and my husband had the home made parpadelle with chorizo.  Both under $20.  My dish was light and yet flavorful.  The fish came in a good portion and was quite filling.  The chorizo was really tasty and the parpadelle was rich but not disgusting. 

Despite being in a hurry, we opted to try the maple creme brulee for dessert.  It was delicious, although I couldn't really tell the maple taste in it.  

It's also a fun place to people watch.  Large groups of friend and people on their first dates, drinking lots of cocktails and having a good time.  A great place to dine on a summer night."}
{"text":"We had the duck risotto, grilled scallop risotto and cheese nam appetizer and everything was wonderful!  . We (my wife) make some of the best risotto I have ever tasted and we know the effort involved to get it this good! And boy was this good!  The cheese nam was also excellent and
Something we will be making at home in the very near future!  Great service, good beer and wine!   Really like if there was an IPA on tap!  :-).  But all in all we will be back!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here yet, but based on ambiance alone, it's at the top of my list to check out the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Très belle terrasse intérieure au coeur du centre-ville. C'est un endroit parfait pour être au calme tout en étant au coeur de la ville. Concernant la bouffe, les frites en entrée sont très bonnes. Menu principal, la majorité des plats auquels j'ai goûté étaient très bons. Je recommande ce restaurant à tout ceux qui veulent relaxer le midi après une promenage au centre-ville."}
{"text":"Good food, but the service was a little off; perhaps because it was a busy Saturday night, or because the server was having a bad night. Either way, it was a little off-putting. However, the food was pretty good -- especially the braised duck with polenta (topped with bacon -- what what!). With that said, it's not the best meal in the area, but Boris Bistro certainly has the best patio."}
{"text":"One of the best meals that we had in town. 

A beautiful outdoor patio under canopy tops. Even better, they had smoking and non smoking sections, which I learned later in my trip are a must. Excellent, helpful service, and inexpensive prices. I had the Lamb shank confit, tomato sauce and creamy polenta. It was succulent and just fell off the bone. Kris had the Mahi-mahi on crispy vegetables served with jasmine rice and loved it. We also split an order of the duck fat fries, which were good. 

A great meal in a nice setting. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My friend and I dropped in for brunch. We didnt have a reservation so we werent able to get a table outside, but we sat indoors right by the window. We ordered the foie gras for appetizer, warm salad with shrimp (which was 4-5 jumbo shrimps on top of steamed veggies), and tuna boris style. Everything was delicious and we were very satisfied with our meal. It was the perfect brunch spot. Highly recommend checking it out but get a reservation in advance!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Great outdoor seating, fantastic people watching and their vegan plate was delicious.  It is around the corner from all the Old Montreal hotspots, but worth the extra walk."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fantastic, such a great patio, I was a little disappointed over the food though. The fries weren't very tasty and the potato wasn't very thick (I didn't taste any soft potato). The duck risotto was a little tasteless, although the steak tartar was quite yummy (strong mustard taste though). The coffee beer was great! Service was good too, I just wish that the food was better!"}
{"text":"Loved the backyard seating area. So sexy. We were lucky enough to get a table outside on a Saturday night without reservations. Food is very good. Risotto with scallops was delicious.  My husband had salmon tartar as a main dish. That dish was excellent."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner last night without knowing what to expect and we really enjoyed it.  The atmosphere is unique.  The front of the large open patio is just the facade of the original building..  Walking by you could easily miss it.  The bar and the indoor part of the restaurant are actually located on the ground floor of the building next door, and it opens up to the patio, which has beautiful large trees and umbrellas, giving it a casual yet elegant feel.  The food was great.  We ordered the mushroom nem as an appetizer, which is basically a spring roll with mushrooms and cheese, served with a berry compote.  The balance of savory and sweet was perfect.  Our entrees were the duck risotto and the grilled shrimp with creamy spicy quinoa.  Both were excellent and we've already decided to go back for more of the duck risotto - it was that good!"}
{"text":"A nice terrasse in the middle of the city. The feeling I had was that I escaped the city. It's a bit noisy, you can't hear your neighbor. Food is good."}
{"text":"This place has an enormous, lovely, shaded patio that was perfect for a warm May Saturday. It's hidden behind some beautiful iron gates and not super visible from the street, so make sure you've got it pulled up on your GPS. The patio itself is inside the shell of an old building and full of lovely trees, really something special. Our group tried a bunch of their small plates as shared tapas, which is not really how you're supposed to order, but everything was wonderful. Our server was excellent and very accommodating. Highly recommend the tuna tartare and the beef tataki!"}
{"text":"Très belle terrasse et serveur très charmant. Nous étions 4 et nous avons tous aimé nos plats! Ça fait longtemps que j'étais allée, mais j'y retournerai certainement dans un délai plus rapproché!"}
{"text":"The host refused to seat us because we had a child with us, or at least that is what he said.  However, there was another table where there were 2 kids seated.  The host said that since they have a bar license, they can not allow kids.  Either they violated the license rules by allowing the other kids, or we were discriminated."}
{"text":"Boris Bistro is a hidden gem in old Montreal. I pass by from time to time and always assumed it's a pretentious overpriced restaurant. However, after I finally got a chance to try it, I fell in love with it immediately.

The best part of Boris Bistro is their terrasse. It's only open during summer time and looks like an abandoned back yard brought back to life by the merry guests. Very few things can beat the feeling of sipping a refreshing drink under the trees in a breezy summer night.

Boris Bistro has a nice wine list and surprisingly cheap happy hour drinks that can make sure you are drunk before the night comes.

Of course, the food is the highlight as well!

I tried their red tuna, grilled to perfection. And the dessert! The combination of chocolate and salted caramel is just divine!

I'll definitely go back there for more drinks. :) The waitress told me that it's better to go before 5pm, or it may be hard to get seats."}
{"text":"Very cool place. The outdoor patio is one
of the nicest spots in Montreal. Had dinner on a Saturday night. Food was
excellent  and service was friendly and attentive. Duck risotto was a standout and all of the three courses we had were very very good. About $70-$80 per person all in with few glasses of wine each. Far from
cheap, but, a good value considering the total package of food and ambiance."}
{"text":"We went here after the light show at Notre Dome in Old Montreal.  It is a short walk, about 7 blocks, and has some amazing open air seating in their courtyard.  When we got there we walked into the restaurant and saw that no one was in there.  We started to get a little scared but then we were directed to the courtyard which was packed.  Once seated we were greeted by a nice waitress but she seemed somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of people she was waiting on.  We ordered our drinks and about 10 minutes later.  Then it just got worse.   We didn't get any bread, our appetizer took a decent amount of time to come out and our meals were pretty late as well.  That is the service side of things, now for taste.  The appetizer we got was very good.  My wife's meal was amazing but my meal was pretty bland.  I can not fault the restaurant for this though.  I ordered a pasta that comes with andouille sausage, but I asked for them to keep that off.  So the pasta wasn't up to the full potential.  

I would suggest this restaurant again and I would probably give it another try but I would definitely look at other restaurants before coming back."}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun at this restaurant. The food was good but the atmosphere was the best part. Great drinks! 
Our waiter was really helpful and polite. I would come back!"}
{"text":"When first arriving at the address listed this looks like an office building, but a few feet further you'll see the preserved heritage stone facade that opens on to a leafy lovely terrasse. When I called in advance Boris couldn't take my reservation for 10 for 5pm but assured me there was a good chance we could be seated when we arrived, don't know if it was the cloudy skies or the fact that we knew we'd be done by 7 but they seated us no problem (much to my relief) and accommodated all our extra guests without batting an eye.

The staff in general I found super sweet, attentive without hovering, and just generally professional. 

Nom-wise I enjoyed my wine immensely, and the rounds of duck fat fries with the mayo-ketchup-Harissa dip were definite crowd-pleasers. 

Overall, a great option to have in your pocket for downtown / old Mtl terrasses."}
{"text":"Perfect for afternoon drinks in the summer! This bistro's best quality is it's location and decor. An urban garden growing in the carcass of an old building, basked in warm rays of light. Great for a date or a (slightly expensive) 5 à 7. 
The sangria is fruity, fresh and high in alcohol content... The menu was pretty diverse for a bistro. I had the beef tartare, which was pretty good if it wasn't for the excessive amount of capers...
Overall, a beautiful place to grab drinks. Will definetely be returning for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - first time in summer when we sat at the outdoor terrace, and the second time in winter when we were all seated indoors. 

Obviously a popular place looking at the lunch crowd. Food is very savory. Amongst us, we had the duck risotto, salmon tartare and the grilled scallops - all delectable. 

Ambience is pretty much what you'll expect in a bistro downtown. Service was pleasant and fast."}
{"text":"A great find recommended by our concierge. We were looking for something in the neighborhood, nothing too complicated and reasonably priced with an interesting menu. Boris Bistro fit our requirements perfectly. A creative menu with French flair, the selections were interesting, creative and tasty. I had a bowl of what was billed as old fashioned tomato soup; fortunately it had chunks of fresh tomatoes as well as tasty croutons. I followed it with salmon tartare, actually a wedge of raw salmon accompanied by a small mixed greens salad and string potatoes fried in duck fat. It was better than it sounds. My dining partner had seared tuna and it was equally good accompanied by steamed vegies. For desert we tried the incredible chocolate with salted caramel, actually a hard mousse (fudge) and so rich the tiny portion served its purpose just right. The service was even, helpful and there when needed. It was not particularly busy that evening so the background music didn't drown out our conversation. We recommend Boris Bistro for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"We enjoyed all our dishes... the wines were good and the cocktails not so good...  overall we enjoyed the experience, the food was enjoyable and the service was good...but we were surprised by the size of the bill when it came ;-)

Would definitely recommend and would come back again..."}
{"text":"Super nice outdoor patio! Lots of place!
Be careful to the women wearing nice fancy stiletto, there is small gravel on the patio area.
The food was great, had the \"veau au lait du quebec\" 
It was great and reminded me of short ribs
The service was a little slow but that's ok
Nice food and wine selection.
My coup de coeur was the patatas bravas ailoli....the potatoes were ok, little saggy.
Would go again for the outdoor setting"}
{"text":"Highly recommend for el fresco patio and the fresh fare.  The staff was kind and attentive.  The courtyard seating was comfortable and pleasant.   It was a joy to have a our first meal on our #Montreal family vacation here.  #travel #foodie"}
{"text":"We were lucky to find Boris Bistro the first evening of our 20th anniversary week in Montreal. We've been back several times for lunch (specifically for the fantastic Charcuterie Maison - with a crisp white wine for me and a Quebecois gin martini for my husband). The environment is lovely and the staff attentive, but not intrusive. Do make lunch reservations if you think you'll arrive near 1pm. For dinner at any time, call ahead for reservations."}
{"text":"A solid 4 star review!

If I've learned anything about summers in Montrral, it's all about the terrasse!  In my short visit to this city, it's probably my favorite one.

Very spacious terrasse and tucked away behind some iron gates on McGill, walking in somewhat reminds me of the Secret Garden.  It was perfect for a hot summer day.

I ordered the salmon tartare entree, which included died of duck fat fries (if you read my other reviews you know how I feel about DFF), salad, and a glass of ceviche. You heard me right - 3 sides for one main dish! All three were delicious - the tartare was seasoned perfectly, the ceviche reminded me of Peru, and the DFF were parfait. Full as my dining partner and I were, we also ordered dessert - white chocolate and raspberry spring roll with maple ice cream. Perfect and light for a hot summer day.

I will be back you can bet on it!"}
{"text":"mcdonalds is tastier!   awful service and the food tasted like it was frozen and flash boiled, not grilled or baked.  no taste and dry, dont be fooled by the patio. a waste of money !  try garde manger or jardin nelson for a fine meal and excellent service."}
{"text":"Boris Bistro is simply amazing. The service is excellent, and the waitstaff are friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. The outdoor terasse is beautiful, and a perfect place for a group dinner. The menu has good variety and everybody was very satisfied with their food, and the winning dish was the beef tartar. Desserts were quite good as well. And to top it all off, everything is very reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend getting a reservation to make sure you can sit outside!"}
{"text":"A group of six friends made a late reservation  for a birthday dinner, we were seated immediately and the magic began!! 
The service was spot on the waitress was attentive yet unobtrusive. The food was fantastic especially the duck risotto with orange cream sauce! A must try if you are visiting Montreal-especially in the evening, the garden is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great late afternoon spot for glass of wine and snacks.  The mushroom and cheese nem - was awesome but would have been easier to understand if they called it an egg roll.  Relaxing and attentive service"}
{"text":"This was a neat place! They have a beautiful courtyard that you can see from inside the restaurant. Intimate, romantic ambience. I had the best mojito I've ever had in my life here. We just went for drinks, but I'd definitely go back to try the food!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended - for both fantastic food and excellent service!  The staff are highly attentive and genuinely want you to have a wonderful experience.  My mum and I had dinner at Boris Bistro tonight - my mum had special requests for her medial condition - the staff assisted and the chef made a perfect meal.  I had the warm poached shrimp salad - heavenly!  They have a beautiful courtyard and interior dining.  You will love Boris Bistro!"}
{"text":"Average service, middle-of-the-road food, pretty atmosphere.

Salmon tartare was simple, subtle, scruptious. Pomme frites in duck fat were perfectly done and grease-free. Main courses were unremarkable however.  We had some braised meat dish with bacon that was too shy on the bacon and virtually bereft of the braise/sauce.

This is a place to go if you want to:

(A) dine outside under a calming canopy of trees in in the midst of bustling downtown Montreal (once inside, the buzz of the city is virtually inperceptable)

(B) you want to go out for a romantic, yet somewhat communal date; the tables are intimately placed around thee expansive veranda 

(C) you have clients to take out (plenty of room for larger parties)

(D) you want to people watch (tourists, attractive servers, sexy Canadians!!!)

Great location too. Just off old town (Vieux Montreal) which means within walking distance of cobblestone streets sprinkled with cafes, nightclubs, and historic escapes."}
{"text":"We went there in the middle of the afternoon for drinks and snacks. Beautiful relaxing terrace with an amazing façade facing the street (maybe to maintain the old world integrity of the area) and nice trees on the inside. Perfect place to hang out with old friends. Inside looked very modern and a good alternative if the weather is not cooperating for the seating on the terrace. Food was good although they were out of cheese for the poutine so I decided to go for a similar style dish that is more of a Portuguese style, not sure if it is even on the menu since it was suggested by the wait staff as we felt like poutine that day. The mayo on the side was delicious so do not forget to use it as a dip for the fries. The second app was grilled scallops with risotto and lobster oil. I am not a fan of risotto so not sure why I ordered this dish, probably because of the scallops. Liked the two scallops, however the quantity of risotto overpowered the overall dish. I would go for something else next time. Service was good. I would recommend this place to others"}
{"text":"Boris Bistro was recommended to us by the Concierge at Place D'Armes Hotel.  
The food, the service, and the ambiance were just right.  The patio is a must.  We had a few appetizers inside as there was a wait and we later moved outside to enjoy our lunch.  
As appetizers we had patatas bravas with aïoli and Mushroom and cheese nem, fig compote.  At that point we were doubtful about having lunch as both were filling along with the homemade lemonades that were out of this world. But, we wanted to sit in the patio so we decided to proceed with lunch regardless.  We ordered the grilled salmon and caramelized walnuts on baby spinach and endives and the shrimp and quinoa.  Both dishes so incredibly flavorful.... we ate every single bite of it.  No room for dessert (unfortunately).
Thumbs up for originality of dishes, good service and ambiance."}
{"text":"A beautiful place to have brunch!! My girlfriends and I came here while we were in town from the states. They seated us in a very tranquil shaded outdoor area. I had their scallop risotto half portion, which was out of this world! It was so creamy yet not soggy, and the scallops were large. Everyone enjoyed their gourmet meals. My only wish is that I got the full portion but it was a little too pricey for me for a quick bite to eat and I didn't want to walk to town on such a full, heavy stomach. Highly recommend this gem to locals and tourists alike!"}
{"text":"Tres bon et en terrasse cest un endroit magnifique meme si nous etions en ville les arbres et la verdure  fesait tres beau et les repas était délicieux"}
{"text":"Cadre sympa,plats moyens-frites servies froides....,serveurs sympathiques mais désorganisé"}
{"text":"Great spot for a late night dinner or drink.

Please note that whoever identified Boris Bistro as \"good for kids\" was wrong.  Their website clearly states no children or minors even if accompanied by an adult.

This is a perfect location for dinner at 10 pm or a late night cocktail.  Our waitress was helpful, friendly and knew the menu well.

Have your smart phone flashlight app handy because the menu is in small print and the lighting outside is insufficient for reading.

The lighting is right for an intimate dinner.

We will be back."}
{"text":"I'll spare you the details but the owner here is a complete arrogant and rude human being. Has no care for customers and has a foul mouth. Barely tried the food here, was out for an exposition and almost nothing was offered to eat. Will never go back for anything hosted here. Save yourself from a disappointing night and go across the street to N900 for some pizza it's really good! :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a local resident. We wanted a place with atmosphere that was not touristy. This place was amazing and I highly recommend it. We started with the mushroom and cheese app. Had the scallops and risotto entree and tuna entree. They were both very tasty, and beautifully prepared. For dessert we chose the lemon and praline eclare.  Not one item was i disapponted with. The outdoor garden is a must to sit in. Situated in an old shell of a building, completely open except for the brick facade.  Truly a memorable dinner. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent!
The service was fantastic.
Everything we ordered was delicious and scallops risotto with lobster sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"Sitting outside on a pleasant summer Sunday evening, we had one of the best meals anywhere, anytime.  Although the highly touted duck risotto was less than expected, the Lapin de Val was superb in an enchanting rosemary infused cream sauce. Service by Anabel was exemplary.  Finishing off a fine meal was the super tasty, evidently local, strawberries with mascarpone and my wife had a lovely creme brulee, not exactly in the french style, but creamy and delicious nonetheless. An excellent dining experience"}
{"text":"Great outdoor atmosphere with the trees, and muted lighting. The food was terrific, as were the drink pairings. Enjoy this cozy place when in Montreal."}
{"text":"great service... not so great food. I had the vegan plate, described as a vegan pate made from vegetables and nuts served with vegetables. The \"pate\"  ended up being a sort of vegan meatloaf. Very dry while the \"vegetables\" was grilled red bell pepper. I ate the entire plate and was still hungry. My mom had the rabbit, and said it was okay, but dry, while my dad had the salmon gravlax, which he simply couldn't eat. Their drinks also were pretty bad and very overpriced! However, our waitress was a total sweetheart."}
{"text":"Very nice garden seating; food was quite nice as well.  If a relaxing patio evening is your goal, I would highly recommend taking Boris Bistro for a whirl.  My only complaint was that the scallops I ordered came wrapped in bacon, which was not on the menu.  I peeled it off and ate the scallops, but really they should put that in the menu; big miss."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend. We set outside. The environment and the ambiance were quite good. The service was satisfactory. I ordered a main dish with lamp. The smell of lamp was a little bit strong but adding the flavor of almond, mint and sour sauce, the taste in general was really delicious."}
{"text":"Llevo un mes en Montreal y es con diferencia el mejor restaurante donde he comido. El sitio es precioso tanto dentro como fuera. El servicio perfecto, amable pero no agobiante y siempre atento. Y la comida excepcional...yo ví el rissoto en una una mesa y lo pedí por la buena pinta que tenía y Dios mío que cosa más deliciosa. La morcilla de mi amigo deliciosa como la de España. Y el cordero de mi novio se deshacía en la boca...volveré seguro. Y el postre pequeño pero perfecto con lo intenso que era"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. It is a happening place. Vibrant crowd which is fun and exciting. Not a place for a small romantic dinner but a fun place to take friends; hang out on the huge terrace and have a terrific meal."}
{"text":"Had a prefix dinner on V day. Was a bit skeptic but after every dish I was pleasantly surprised as to how much I enjoyed everything. Even their desserts were soooo tasty but not filling. I'd say the taste is great! Small portions. Nice waiters. Not muh bang for the buck but very yummy."}
{"text":"Great food & nice atmosphere. Wish it had been warmer as the patio looked wonderful. I had the rabbit which I haven't had outside of France. It was a simple meal with rice, broccoli and a sauce. C'etait Bon and wasn't too heavy. My husband got the risotto which was amazing but very rich. For dessert we shared the Cheesecake Ice cream-a must!

Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We had arrived at Le Westin, Montreal, after the short flight from Newark, NJ and were hungry! After consulting with our concierge, we were sent off on foot with a map marked with the route to the Boris Bistro. As it is not very well marked from the outside, we had a bit of trouble finding it.
But it was well worth the walk and search; we were not disappointed!
Since it was August, a cafe setting in a terrace was perfect. We received prompt service and ordered the seared scallops over risotto, with lobster oil. Asking for the lunch portion we were perhaps misunderstood to be asking for the large portion. What a happy mistake: this entree was fantastic! Even the bread served us beforehand was wonderful. Highly recommend this hidden gem, which feels to be a secret garden only few are privy to, despite it being crowded. We will be back next trip to wonderful Montreal!"}
{"text":"We were walking towards Old Montreal and hadn't had lunch, and it was getting pretty late. I was looking for a place still serving food a little after 2pm, and while headed to another location we walked past Boris Bistro. I saw the really beautiful patio, with plants and wrought iron tables and umbrellas, and I decided to stop in here instead. I'm glad I did! 
It's so relaxing to sit in their really beautiful outside patio area, but it's still relatively private; it's walled in from the street. It feels a bit like eating in a garden :) 
We got caught up in the moment and ended up ordering a bottle of rose :) We're on vacation, so day drinking is OK, right? 
I had the salmon tartare with salad and fries, and my husband had the half portion of scallop and shrimp risotto. I thought his risotto was the perfect size for lunch, but him being him, scarfed it down and was looking for more food. Luckily, my tartare came with a huge portion of very tasty duck fat fries and lots of greens, and I had plenty to share. I really enjoyed the slightly spicy sauce that I ended up using on everything. 
Summary: solid food, friendly service, and a really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"An overall very successful execution of fine dining with the terrace setting, service and food if compared to places to eat of the same kind. I ordered to duck risotto as a small plate and the rabbit with potatoes. Along with two mojitos to complete meal went well. 

I wouldn't say that I was amazed but I would say I was satisfied with the entire experience. The service itself from our waitress was A++. I wish the terrace was lit better in between day to night but it was such a minor hiccup.

The meal itself was fulfilling, tasty and enjoyable. We had walked 20 mins from our hotel but def taxi cabbed it back because we were so full."}
{"text":"Cela faisait une éternité que je n'y étais pas retourné et je le regrette. Mon souvenir était que c'était bon, certes, mais un peu cher et pas très généreux.

Notez que je ne peux me prononcer sur le menu du soir car je n'y suis qu'allé que pour le lunch, comme aujourd'hui. Eh bien, j'en suis ressorti (presque) comblé.

D'abord le service était impeccable et attentionné. Ensuite la carte est passablement bonifiée pour offrir un menu midi à plat + 4$ pour avoir entrée (soupe, salade ou rillettes), dessert ET CAFÉ EXPRESSO.

Juste pour ça, j'y retourne. Là on parle de générosité.

La qualité des plats était correcte+, mon seul bémol étant la sauce des linguinis aux champignons beaucoup trop liquide. Sinon la crème d'oignons et le dessert étaient excellents.

Donc j'y retourne, c'est sûr. Dommage qu'ils ne soient pas sur Opentable."}
{"text":"4 etoiles pour la magnifique terrasse verte et la limonade maison mmmm tasty!! Chic service , chants d'oiseux comme musique de fond, chandelles romantiques , tout pour une belle date ;)"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant with great atmosphere and lots of potential but poor service and average food takes this review from four stars to two. 

Would you be happy spending $85+tip on this? 

1. The reservation for table on the terrace was \"lost\" and we sat inside.
2. Our food was left under the kitchen heater so long it was hot and cold at the same time (was there no one designated to run food?)
3. Our waiter was covering too many tables and could not manage all of them (e.g. I asked for a second glass of wine with dinner and was brought the menu half way through my entree). 

Management take note. The food is average at best and the menu predictable. Montreal is supposed to be one of the best \"culinary cities\" in North America. Either fire your manager or get a new chef because mediocre food and sloppy service is a recipe for unhappy foodies. I really wanted to love this restaurant but even duck fat fries can't save this one."}
