{"text":"Doffer's used to be Southfork and my husband and I were regulars at Southfork Sandwich shop and miss it so much! We tried Doffer's for the first time tonight and it was not too bad...but not the sandwich shop! I had the Cubanano sandwich with fries, which didn't compare to the Cuban that Southfork served. Honestly it was mostly about the bread. The insides were good, but it was served on a store bought hoggie role with little flavor. (Southfork had the BEST bread!) My husband had Tacos and enjoyed them. The fries were tasty, hot and crispy! We'll be back, but rather than compare to Southfork I'll try to embrace the new southwest theme and go for a rice bowl!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant. Loved the cuban sandwich! Friends tell me their burritos are really good as well. Really nice variety of local craft beers. You should try the Birdsong Jalape√±o IPA."}
{"text":"What a find in tiny Cramerton! Tacos are amazing! Mojo Chicken and Carneys are my favorite. Sweet potato and black bean is also incredible. Excellent selection of local craft beer is an added bonus. Check out Goat Island Park right across the street while you're in town."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a dozen times or so since my first review.  I've had the Philly, several of the tacos, the Cuban, and most recently the Mojo Chicken Panini.  All have been excellent.  For sides, I especially enjoy the retired black beans... Yum!  The staff is friendly and the food is good, I can't ask for more."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the tacos here. The black bean sweet potato or the shrimp option are both delicious. I like the decor and the vibe of the place."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Super fresh.  Great menu.  Customer service is as good as it gets.  Very nice draft and bottled beer selection, too! Doffer's is destined to become a local favorite."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant in Cramerton. Started out with pineapple salsa and queso. Both delicious. Our group had sandwiches and tacos. The tacos were especially flavorful and the creamy coleslaw some of the best. Nice home town atmosphere with good beer selection.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great selection of micro brews and ciders!! If you're not a beer drinker or would rather have a kombucha this place is excellent. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs - and the food was very reasonable and delicious. We will be coming back! (Family friendly too!)"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good taco and we found great ones ! I got the carney and my husband got the mojo and 2 craft beers on tap !! It was delicious! We will be back! And picked up some single beers to try ."}
{"text":"After a plethora of holiday turkey and ham we decided Mexican sounded about right for dinner. So glad we decided to try Doffer's this evening. Ordered take-out and everything was hot and fresh. I ordered the Beef Chili Tacos and they were AWESOME. My side salad was equally as good. I took a leap of faith and tried the Balsamic Caesar dressing.....excellent choice. The hubs ordered the Sweet Club Sandwich with fries. He loved it. We will definitely be regulars!"}
{"text":"It's better than any other burrito joint I've been to, and I've been to many burrito places all over the Southeast. Good job!"}
{"text":"We really like Doffer's.  It's an eclectic mix of a bottle shop (beer and wine) & a cool cantina serving up tacos and burritos, huge salads and tasty sandwiches.   Customer service is consistently good here, with Hillary at the front register smiling at you as you enter and quick to suggest a local draught beer from one of six taps or something from the large selection in the cooler.  If you're lucky, you'll stop by on a day that she's made sangria - yum.   We've pretty much eaten our way through the menu, at this point, and like just about everything.  I personally like the mojo chicken panini and the chicken taco salad. Others in my party have enjoyed the large quesadillas and steak tacos. The ONLY thing that I can complain about is the guacamole.  I'll admit that I'm somewhat of a snob when it comes to avocadoes and feel that any place that serves tacos and burritos should make guac that is ON POINT.  This one misses the mark a little, tasting like it came from a package and not made in-house. (I'm not sure if they make it or not, but that's what it tastes like to me) However, their pico de gallo and queso are both good.  There's plenty of seating inside and they have a nice patio outside.  Parking can sometimes be an issue, but otherwise, we'll be back often."}
{"text":"Doffer's has something for everyone! The tacos and rice bowls are quite tasty and the fries are addictive. Great food combined with a good variety of local beer make this a personal favorite.   It's my go-to answer for that dreaded question: \"What's for dinner?\"   Give em a shot, I guarantee you'll be back..."}
{"text":"Excellent place ... outstanding service and incredible food !!! If you're in the Charlotte area make the trip over.   Totally worth it if you're a foodie and if you're not, it might make you one !"}
{"text":"Good steak tacos. The salsa was charred green peppers. The slaw had black pepper and was great. My wife enjoyed her bowl with the chicken. The have a simple but good kids menu. Best steak tacos in the Charlotte area. Just under tower 7 at Wrightsville Beach. I hav been back and the shrimp and chicken tacos are good but the steak is the best"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere, an absolutely amazing beer selections, and the tacos are the best I've had in a long time. Thank you for bringing good tacos and good food close to home. I will be back, hungry for more Chipotle shrimp tacos"}
{"text":"I went to Doffer's with high hopes- I'd read a lot about it in the news, and well, let's be honest, it sits in the shadow of South Fork Deli. No. So many things wrong with this place.   First, I got the chicken tacos, figuring it would be a solid staple. No. The tortillas were cold, the chicken didn't taste like it was marinated in anything, the cheese was clearly the orange strings that come from a bulk bag, and the \"salsa' was a handful of diced tomatoes, red onion, and green pepper haphazardly thrown on there. Second, they kindly put sour cream on the side, but as an establishment that sells only hand-held items, had no utensils to spread it with. I used a straw. Third, the tacos were accompanied by french fries. What kind of self-proclaimed taco place serves tacos without chips and salsa, or guacamole, or something vaguely related to the theme? That being said, the french fries were delicious, even though I recognized them as the same brand served by my college dining hall.  Aside from their food, their aesthetic was extremely confusing. Doffer's makes me think of British chimney sweeps, but Canteen makes me think Wild West. Yet they advertise themselves as a taco place/ deli. They really mean that they sell subpar tacos and sandwiches, with some bottled beer. If they're really a taco place, why are there no margaritas or tequila? A bonkers place with awful food."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Everything is fresh and the flavors just burst in your mouth. I want to eat here everyday, it's that delicious! The owners are super nice too and you can tell they take great pride n their food. They want you to be happy and I can tell you, we were happy with the entire experience. I had the Carneys tacos and my husband had the sweet club sandwich. We had the chips and salsa too. The best salsa I've ever had! We will definitely be back with all our neighbors and friends too."}
{"text":"Updating my review after returning several times.  New favorite is the chicken salad sandwich with their house made pickles added.  Love the sweet club as well and the salads and all the dressings are amazing!  Peompt, friendly service everytime.  We love this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places for lunch. Lots of great vegetarian options that could easily also be made vegan. Not an easy find in this area. The food is freshly made and of very good quality. Some favorites are the sweet potato and black bean tacos, pintos, cole slaw, and the lean green salad with queso fresco and apple cider vinaigrette. They also have fresh soups made daily and local beers on tap as well as an awesome selection  in the cooler. The prices are more than reasonable and the staff and owner are so welcoming and friendly!! In the warmer months sit outside and enjoy the surrounding of the quaint downtown area of Cramerton. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find such a groovy lunch spot in the tiny town of Cramerton! The food was excellent -- great shrimp tacos, unique sandwiches, and killer fries. The food here is definitely better than most places in Belmont or Cramerton -- more on par with Charlotte. Even better, this place has a great craft beer selection! The beers on tap were super cheap and they had a wide variety -- IPAs, stouts, ciders, seasonal beers, etc.. The staff were friendly and they graciously let me sample several beers before ordering.   I'm so excited to have found such a good lunch spot in the area. It's the perfect place to grab a bite to eat (and a pint) after exploring Goat Island Park. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Solid place. They have a couple of decent drafts to enjoy plus an extensive reach-in cooler for bottles of all kinds. Tasty food to be found here!"}
{"text":"We love it here.  Good beer, friendly service even when they are busy, great music, and Dave has done an amazing job with the food.  But please don't touch the brownies.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is really eclectic and cool, and I was definitely surprised to find it in Belmont (though honestly I realize I shouldn't be now!). They had what I BELIEVE was blackened swordfish tacos on special when I went and wow. Just wow they were amazing. Fresh fish (or so it tasted, which is really all that matters), and they were beautifully spicy. This place has beers and a good selection of fun non alcoholic drinks as well (important for me as I'm preg!). We came during lunch and I'm certain we will be back for a weekend night out."}
{"text":"First time and I certainly will be back. Delicious chicken burrito (Chiptole style,not fried or sauced) I would call it a SW wrap, that being said it was yummmmm. Great selection of beer. Glad I found the place."}
{"text":"Doffer's is incredible. Some friends and I started eating here after podcasting and it has become one of my family's favorite spots. The food is always really, really good and they staff is super nice! I recommend the Carneys, the beans and rice, and the french fries. They use some excellent ingredients and have really good prices. Plus, it's just kind of a fun place. We have brought lots of friends and family here and everyone has enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is a great local eatery where you can build your own taco or bowl if you want to! They have a very fresh Tex-Mex selection and a very cool atmosphere! Kind of hidden but well worth looking for!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite spots in town, such a friendly staff and the food is outstanding, it's very kid friendly which is a huge plus, ever since they opened we typically go once a week. Highly recommend this place, great atmosphere, great food, and great service!"}
{"text":"Doffer's is one of our favorites on our regular rotation.  We were sad when South Fork Deli closed here but glad Doffer's has lived up to it's legacy.  The menu is similar with salads, soups and sandwiches but adds on a tex-mex section of tacos, quesadillas, etc.  Everything I've had here is good and it sounds weird but they have the best fries!  They also have a good selection of local and craft beer in the cooler with a few on tap, as well as homemade sangria.  You do order at the counter but the staff is friendly and attentive in spite of this.  The order counter can get backed up during peak times and take a while so just keep that in mind.  Otherwise you can't go wrong with Doffer's."}
{"text":"Chicken salad  and cole slaw were  great, the service and people were even better!  Great place for a quick bite since we were traveling!"}
{"text":"The Old Timer and seasoned fries were amazing. My husband had the steak tacos which were also great."}
{"text":"The food taste really good.  Just don't order Togo. They don't take as much care in that.  The place is also just a little too loud. A lot too loud. But that's personal preference.  The food is good tho. Just remember. Don't order to go.  Get a brownie. Don't forget.   Came back twice to my review to edit it.   The food is good.. the bowl is just not great. The lady does not give very good service.  And still please don't order to go. You will be more mad than me that you did because you didn't listen to this warning.  But if you get the brownie you will feel slightly better about it.  In the event that you absolutely have to order Togo. Make sure you ask for more pico. And then more pico again. And then one more time. More fking pico. More pico means more pico so please put more fkng pico in my order!!!!!!! Thank you.  One. Last. Time.  The bowl is shit. It is not steak. It's more like a dry shit ground beef. If I sound a little hostile. It's cause I am just getting more mad at how bad this is and how hungry I was and how much I was looking forward to this meal. The tacos I've had from here where amazing. But the same cannot be said for the bowl. This bowl is pissing me off. It is dry and bland and shit. I hope the workers read this review. I am looking at you as I am writing this. If this brownie is bad also today. I swear I am going to lose my shit."}
{"text":"Food is good, but too expensive for what you get. My husband ate a sandwich when we got home because his $10 plate left him hungry."}
{"text":"For what it is, it is pretty great. Good service. Tasty foods. Great beer selection. Cool environment. A great, quick stop."}
{"text":"Doffer's Canteen is a casual restaurant that is terrific for dinner, lunch, or just relaxing on their patio and sipping one of the many beers they have available. On this occasion, it was dinner time.  We started with their tortilla chips and queso. The chips themselves were beyond reproach. They weren't noticeably warm when served so I don't think they were fried to order, but they were so crispy and fresh-tasting they may as well have been. The queso was just what we wanted it to be: rich, gooey, salty, and tangy. We polished it off with only about 2/3 of the chips we were served so I wish we had more of it, but I guess that's what happens when it's that good.  For my main, I got the Cuban sandwich with slaw for my side. The Cuban is pulled pork with sliced ham, pickles, yellow mustard, and Swiss cheese on a pressed hoagie. While not entirely authentic (not roast pork, ham was thin deli-sliced, and it came on a pressed hoagie and not Cuban bread), it came close enough that if I closed my eyes, I almost couldn't tell the difference. It was really delicious. The slaw I got on the side was creamy, tangy, not too sweet, and not overdressed; in other words, it was perfect.  They have a huge canned beer selection with lots of craft varieties and some macrobrews as well. They also had a pleasant selection of five beers on draft.  The only downside was the slightly haphazard service. Our chips took a trip around the whole place before they got to us. It may have been because they were busy, understaffed in the dining area, or a combination of both.  I got one of the brownies they had at the register on my way out, and it was amazing. They have a cheeky sign not to touch the brownies for sale and it was fingerprint-free, which I appreciated. Protip: get the brownie. I'll be back here soon enough for another one."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and wonderful service always! My favorite is the October salad! Owner always makes sure customers are happy."}
{"text":"The steak tacos were amazing and the guacamole and chips good too.  If you are a vegetarian, my vegan GF recommends the poblano and corn tacos too.  The side salad with the southwestern avocado dressing was the bomb diggity"}
{"text":"We enjoy their tacos, which can be Vegan.  The black bean and sweet potato is a great combination.  The outside seating is fun with the train passing neArby in warmer months"}
{"text":"Great little find on Halloween night!  The vibe is great, eclectic and artsy.  You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you.  The food was delicious!  The tacos were well made, with smoky beef and a delicious sort of chimichurri to put on top.  The refried black beans were good too, needed to be just a tad warmer.  My mom had a salad and it looked fresh and amazing...and huge!  Don't skip the queso dip, delish!"}
{"text":"This place is uses fresh ingredients and stuffs the tacos full of meat. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Lots of menu items and beer/wine choices. Staff is attentive and friendly; food is delicious! We had the fries-awesome, slaw, ham and cheese and the crunchy gringo. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is a local spot I decided to try out when they first opened. I had the shrimp tacos with rice.... and I was VERY disappointed to say the least!! I went back to give them another shot was even more bummed then my first visit. Haven't been back since.. I really don't like leaving bad reviews either!!"}
{"text":"Great food here ! Friendly folks cooking amazing food ! They also have a great beer selection ! We had the shrimp, chicken, pork, and blackened salmon tacos and they were EXCELLENT ! My wife had a side salad that had plenty of good fresh veggies and I had fries as my side. The fries we very good as well. Doffers is definitely worth checking out if you end up in the area."}
{"text":"just a cute little canteen with good food and craft beer in downtown cramerton, the seasoned fries are to die for"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Cuban sandwich I've ever had. The pork was tender and flavourful, the ham was plentiful and had a nice saltyness to it, cheese was plentiful and melted perfect. They didn't over complicate the mustard and used regular yellow mustard (like a Cuban is supposed to have) and they had great home made pickles on it. The fries were great too. They were good and crispy without being burnt. This is definitely going to be my go to for Cubans sandwiches now."}
{"text":"After a disappointing first visit during DC's first week open, we decided to wait & try it again before writing a review. Well, sadly, it went from underwhelming to awful.   Our first visit we had pork & shrimp tacos. We were surprised by the small order for the price. We were even more surprised at the lack of \"specialty\" to the tacos. They were short on flavor and the toppings were minuscule. A cheap sprinkle of cheese and a single cilantro leaf. The salsa was way too spicy and the flavor was just not good.   Our second visit we ordered chili beef tacos & a steak burrito. The chili beef tacos were ok, again, nothing special and the beef not especially flavorful. The topping again, were scant. The tiniest dusting of cheese & a small cilantro leaf, and a few pickled onions. The steak burrito, was awful, literally inedible. The \"steak\" was a mushy ground steak wrapped up with mushy flavorless beans & rice. We each could barely swallow one bite.   Another issue is the menu listed online shows tortilla chips as one of the sides, but when ordering we were told that chips were extra. First of all, how ridiculous to charge extra for tortilla chips at a taco shop. Second of all, your menu should be correct online!   I don't like to write such an awful review but we have now wasted $40+ on disappointing and in some cases, disgusting food. We will NOT return. We ask the owner please contact us to discuss a refund for our dinner tonight.   *this review will also be shared elsewhere online*"}
{"text":"Great location, atmosphere and staff. Food is delicious and has only gotten better with time. My go to is the steak quesadilla, but the Cuban sandwich and mojo chicken panini are delicious. They have rotating taps featuring local beers that are actually selected well with a decent variety. Thanks for always being friendly and making for an enjoyable experience time after time."}
{"text":"We had a chicken and veggie burrito and a philly cheese steak. Both were excellent and served up quick! The staff was friendly and accommodating. Lots of craft beer choices. Ingredients were clearly fresh."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place from their homemade refried black beans and guacamole to their amazing tacos. This is the type of place that you'll be picking out your next meal while you're trying to order your current meal. These guys are putting a lot of effort in to doing things right."}
{"text":"Really good food that is reasonably priced.  The employees were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"We finally tried Doffer's, and we are mad we waited so long! My husband had the Cuban Sandwich. He absolutely loved it! The meat was tender and juicy and full of mustardy goodness. I had the shrimp tacos and they were flavorful and cooked perfectly. This is a great place for a casual relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Terrific beer choices! Great ambiance! There are no bad choices for meals, EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!  Don't let the line out the door deter you. The service is super fast and totally worth it."}
