{"text":"A most excellent dining experience and hookah too!   A group of coworkers & I met here on a recommendation of 1 of us.    So delicious!   Lamb mandi:   fabulous.     Chicken kabobs:   wonderful.   It's a new spot in University City.    Outdoor seating for hookah.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while on a work trip - great food and very friendly service. We got the chicken schwarma with rice meal, chicken schwarma wrap, hummus, and baba ghanoush. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a good price. Gave us a small cup of cardamom flavored coffee that was very good. Best baklava I have ever had."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service. Our server Mohamed was wonderful. They have an outdoor patio. It also looked like they offered hookah. I'm very happy this is near my neighborhood and will definitely be back. Also, there are vegetarian options, which is awesome for our family. Prices are very good and the portions were large. Super satisfied with our dining experience!"}
{"text":"Second and last time I will order from here.  They call themselves Lazeez for a reason...they are lazy with paying attention to their orders.  I ordered from UberEATS, because I am here on business and I don't have a car.  Both times I ordered hummus and both times they didn't send pita bread with it. So I either wasted my money, or I eat it with a spoon.  I called and they said yes they forgot it...yes I know.  They said I could come pick up pita and I said I don't have a car.  Then they said I could come by and they would give me my money back and that was the only way...guess what, I still don't have a car, which is why I ordered from UberEATS.  I will never order from these guys again!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food! Would of appreciated some more pita with my order since I only got one and that came with my salad. I ordered a combo appetizer and that had two items that come with pita and I didn't get any with that. Just my inner fat kid talking though. Great food otherwise."}
{"text":"Average at best. Didn't really have high expectations after we went in and were the only customers there (and it was during prime lunch time). I got the chicken shwarma over rice and my sister got the gyro plate. The chicken dish was alright, just nothing fantastic that I would want to come back for. We got a side of hummus and pita bread. The pita was thin, cold and stale. The hummus was decent. The gyro meat was thin and tasty and probably my favorite thing out of everything we ordered. Our waiter was very nice and service was great. Overall, not bad but don't really have the desire to come back."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and helpful without being pushy. The food was great! We got a single plate of swarma and it was enough for two!"}
{"text":"Lunch was yummy! Our waitress, Iris was very accommodating. We had the chicken schwarma & ground turkey wraps. We ordered a side of garlic sauce, which was delicious. Will definitely be back. Thank you"}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere and service were all excellent. There is a great selection of food. The soups are fantastic. I had chicken shawarma and was huge (enough for 2 meals) and was fantastic. The drinks are creative and refreshing. I am looking forward to my next visit. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed if you try this restaurant."}
{"text":"We could not have been more pleased with our first lunch here: the service, the setting, chicken shawarma over rice, and chicken pita that came with pickled cauliflower and olives.  Best of all was the Molokhia soup: it was perfect!  I do hope that this good restaurant finds a permanent home in the previously unlucky location behind the new blue line parking deck."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL SURPRISE! On a long road trip, we happened upon this gem, and it was far better than eating at some chain with overly cheery waiters and bland \"combos.\" My husband got the gyro plate and lentil soup. I got the molokhia soup and beef kabob. I asked the waiter to make one of my two kabobs a veggie one. Rather than do that, they added it to my plate for free. All of our dishes were wonderful. And the baklava was literally melt in your mouth good. Best I have ever had. We will go back when driving through Charlotte. Try it. You won't be disappointed. Only trick is Siri took us on a wild ride. You have to drive like you are going to the Panera next door, then hang a right to find it."}
{"text":"Attentive staff and delicious food made my first experience here a good one.  I had the chicken shawarma over rice and it was well prepared and promptly brought to my table.  The complimentary appetizer (small warm crackers and a tomato sauce) was nice.  A frozen citrus cocktail to sip on was sweet and delicious.  I'll definitely be back to this place."}
{"text":"Not very good. We ordered a Gyro & the Lamb meat tasted nothing like NY. Plus it was either baked, broiled, fried very hard, could not bite into it. The fries were cool not cold but cool as if they were cooked first. Just moved here and was looking for a great Mediterranean Place we could frequent either each day or each week.  The garlic mayonnaise's we are use to from a place in Atlanta, prepares it with fresh garlic daily for the Shawarma,  garlic and lemon/lime, Sea Salt are fresh. This did not taste fresh, Not to our liking or tasting."}
{"text":"First time visit and I was very impressed. Kind of hidden behind another building near a CATS terminal near uncc but worth the trip. Stuffed grape leaves, hummas, and kibbie so delicious. When you walk in you can smell the charcoal from the kitchen. tastes so authentic."}
{"text":"Ordered the Lamb Shank and it was CRAZY-good, and super reasonably priced.  Meat that \"falls off the bone\" is an overused phrase, but man does it apply in this case. Accompanying rice was perfect, and it came with a tasty BBQ sauce - not too goopy.  Lulu provided excellent service - definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice. I usually have a big appetite and the very first time I have been there I ordered kebabs and it was good but not enough in quantity to satisfy my appetite. I decided to give it a try again before getting an impression I ordered the days special. It was very rich and was beyond expectations. I particularly felt that the food was great but one has to enquire with them before ordering stuff."}
{"text":"Randomly picked lunch turned out to be a fantastic experience with both the food and service (Marleen). Highly recommended and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Mediterranean/Middle Eastern eatery to frequent for a while now and I think I've finally found it. My boyfriend and I ordered a small hummus starter, lentil soup, lamb mandi, chicken shawarma and Turkish coffee. Service was smooth and prompt without being overbearing, and the food made up for anything the restaurant itself could have lacked in decor. Seriously, the moment our food started coming out, I pretty much forgot about everything else.   I've always loved halal cuisine for the enticing flavors and sensuous spices, and Lazeez definitely does not disappoint on this front. My lentil soup was yummy to the last drop and my lamb was so tender it slid off the bone the moment my fork touched it. I probably could've stuffed myself and eaten everything on the table in one-sitting it was so good, but the entree portions are huge!! We only spent $40 plus tip on all we ordered, so pricing is more than reasonable. I'm very surprised this place isn't more popular but I suspect it has a lot to do with its unfortunate location (behind and completely obscured by the new LYNX station parking deck on Tryon). Don't let the restaurant's somewhat barren parking lot fool you though! If you love Mediterranean food and live around the University area, you should be eating here."}
{"text":"I should've known to turn around with no one else in the restaurant at peak lunch time hours. The shawarma was sooooo dry. The hummus was great. The Naan was DRY. The rice and veggies were ok but I had to mix hummus with my food to combat the dryness.  They told my husband to get a similar item on the menu to what he wanted because it was \"better.\" It was only double the price. Over $30 for lunch that honestly felt like a waste.  No to-go boxes for us.   I should've read the reviews first..."}
{"text":"The worse Mediterranean food Ive had in my life. Bad service and the restaurants freezing cold! Food was dried out and worthless."}
{"text":"I happened upon Lazeez during a business trip and thought it would be a spot to pick up something to take out but it's a beautiful, welcoming dining room with friendly service so I stayed.   An extensive menu, I tired the shish tawook dinner - very good, loved the seasoning. They also gave me a complimentary mint tea afterwards. I thought the veggies on the side were an odd accompaniment but the hummus was delicious. Nice place - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite go to places for homestyle meal.  We had the mandi chicken and rice  It's a nice portion with a reasonable price. They include half of a chicken! The chicken is delicious and tender. I ordered it using postmates just for a change of pace and so glad I did.  Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food was great so was our server.  My only small issue was when we walked in. No one was at the reception table and two staff members walked passed without an acknowledgement.  I certainly would go back again."}
{"text":"From the get go the staff were very confused about taking orders. We were asked by 2 separate waiters for our orders. Then I was brought the wrong meal. Once I got the correct meal, the Gyro large Greek salad, the meat was dry and had hardened in places, the salad greens were wilted and slimy. Their Greek dressing was awful. My friend's meal looked terrible and was not good. There was more confusion with wait staff and 2 people took drink refill orders from us yet it took them 20 mins to bring new drinks. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this restaurant and WOW! I'M AMAZED! I have eaten at many Halal restaurants in Charlotte and while the menus are typically the same, Lazeez has even more to offer. First, the service here is superb. We came in at 10:55 pm on a Saturday night and the restaurant closes for orders at 11 pm. Typically this means that you get lukewarm scraps and shoddy service. This was not the case at all! Our server was extremely polite, the food (more about that later) was steaming hot, and everything was served in a timely manner.   Second, the ambiance! This was definitely the nicest dining area of the halal restaurants that I've visited. White tablecloths, nice drapery, traditional music and soft, yellow lighting set it apart from the other halal restaurants that seem to have more of a hustle and bustle, casual dining feel. This is a place where you could take a lady on a date and not feel as if you cheated her out of a finer dining experience.   Finally, the food! Amazing! Like I said, we got there close to the kitchen closing time. They were still serving hookah on the patio (which, btw, had a nice sky d system and chairs outside. It was like a party out there!). First we got the citrus splash as our drink. It was freshly blended with ice, lemon water and fresh mint. It was so refreshing and an absolute treat! My husband ordered the chicken kabobs and I ordered the Mokat, which is a lamb shank. Each entree came with 2 sides and we both chose the Molokhia soup. The soup was steaming hot and extremely delicious. Our food, as well, was perfectly seasoned. The chicken was moist and grilled to perfection and my lamb literally fell off of the bone when I cut it. I literally have nothing to complain about!  Finally, closing out our ticket was a breeze. The waitress brought her iPad to the table, scanned our card, we selected the tip amount and were ready to leave in less than 3 minutes.   So, if you've managed to make it to the end of this review (Yes, I'm wordy lol), you can pretty much tell that I loved this place and will definitely be returning soon! I hope more people learn more about this restaurant and support it, but being that the blue line garage is literally next door, I don't think that they'll have any issues"}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery and after the delivery eta had passed I called the restaurant to see if my order was en route. The order had been prepared for an hour but there was no delivery driver to deliver my food. I'm so confused as to why the restaurant would cook an order when they had no delivery driver and NOT call the customer. Can't rate food you didn't taste but you can rate poor customer service."}
{"text":"Its not good at all Wait time and food test  Never been disappointed like this The test is not close to Middle Eastern food  No way coming back for lunch in this place I eat in middle eastern in the area  Many times  I give it a chance   First and last  Sorry"}
{"text":"I craving some Mediterranean food. My dad ordered 4 lamb kabobs.. so we waited for the food to get to us. Once the food arrived.. the food looked as if the it was thrown everywhere... I opened my food. Too much rice only 2 sticks of meat!   The rice tasted and looked like it was covered in curry powder. The meat was WELL OVER COOKED and tasted like it was SPOILED and they tried to mask it up by burning the meat. The meat was dry and the Tazaiki sauce tasted like Ranch and lime juice stirred together..  I wouldn't recommend eating here   Maybe if I was to go there and dine in I'd get better food.    Not again"}
{"text":"I came here at lunch on a weekday because I was craving a gyro! I didn't order any appetizer however my wonderful waitress brought me a complimentary one, pita chips with a tomato based sauce which was interesting. My gyro was so so, I've had much better however I did get complimentary coffee which was pretty good. The reason for the 3 stars was because the food wasn't that great but the service was awesome!  I will definitely give it another chance"}
{"text":"Chicken kebab and pilaf rice were good. I didn't find the rest of items tasty. Tried this place few times."}
{"text":"Not sure if this would have been on my regular rotation list for lunch places, but my friend saw this place online and we decided to give it a try.    The location is hidden.  It is located beside the Panera Bread but behind the large parking deck that was recently built.  The building is not new; it used to be another restaurant.   There is ample parking.  When we walk up they have almost a party like atmosphere, there is a speaker playing Mediterranean music and corn hole.  When you walk inside they seat you & greet you warmly; there was zero wait time and we were seated warmly.  The restaurant was not too busy for a Wednesday around lunch.  The ambiance was not my favorite.  There were plastic covers on the tables, think very 1990s.  But the customer service was great.  The waiter started us with the drinks we ordered and complimentary pita chips and a hummus like salsa; not exactly sure of the name.    I ordered a chicken kebab wrap and fries.  It was a ton of food & regretfully I ate most of it.  Definitely show up hungry; very large portions.  The food was not bad, but I'm not sure if it was my taste, some of the flavors were just different and strong.   I was thinking the pita wrap would be more along the Showmars style.  I ordered the chicken kebab wrap with fries; the total with tip was about $10; very reasonable.  Try it, you may like it."}
{"text":"The food here was incredible. We got the chicken shawarma over rice and a beef kebab wrap and neither one disappointed. A perfect balance of flavor and texture. The best part was desert, which we almost skipped out on, but thankfully didn't. The baklava I had here was unparalleled to any I've ever had the blessing of tasting. Absolutely delicious and flakey, with a burst of crunchiness and sweetness on the inside. Our baklava was accompanied by a coffee that further enhanced and brought out the flavors of our desert, I don't even like coffee but I ended up drinking this. The service was incredible as well and the restaurant had a very authentic vibe that I loved. Definetly going to be eating here again."}
{"text":"Excellent Food, service was excellent, prices were great! Ordered chicken shawarma wrap, the chicken was well cooked and the wrap was not messy. The after dinner spiced coffee was a treat. We will return!"}
{"text":"A bit hard to find but worth it   Falafel is very good and the Greek salad perfect    Chicken Shawarma over rice is Delicious!!  Very reasonably priced  our server (LuLu)  was wonderful   Glad we found this!!"}
{"text":"Another YELP find that proved wonderful! We were early for an appointment in Charlotte and hungry (as always) so we hit the nearby button and followed the directions. Wide variety of Middle Eastern food and creative drinks. My wife had a salad that was beautifully presented and a very large portion. I had a wrap and it too was more than I cared to eat as I wanted Turkish Coffee and baklava for dessert. Both of those were great as well. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was coming in from out of town and ordered takeout online. I wish I had waited to visit the restaurant first! They had a buffet set up that looked delicious. The dining area looked nice with comfortable seating. While I was waiting, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The manager/owner offered us coffee spiced with saffron and cardamom while we waited and we were even offered the opportunity to try some of the desserts from the buffet. It was great and I could barely suffer through the ride home to try what I actually ordered. The chicken shawarma was good, as well as the taboulleh salad and hummus. The gyro platter was delightful. The arayes was a must have and had a great blend of spices with some heat. Great food and exceptional customer service!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  I had the lamb chops and my wife had the kofta both were amazing.  The rice is spot on and the service is quick and friendly.  If you like Mediterranean food this place will rival any other restaurant in any city."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, have tried both beef and chicken kabobs; even their sides (hummus and baba ganous) were fresh. I am a fan of middle eastern food and this place is close to my house. If they keep up the high quality, it will save me the relatively longer drive to my other favorite middle eastern restaurant on Sharon amity."}
{"text":"I did not think the food or service was good at all.  I left half my lunch on the plate."}
{"text":"Lazeez is my favorite mediterranean restaurant in Charlotte. I like the fast fresh places like Yafo and Cava, but Lazeez is at the next level and is the best mediterranean. I love the chicken schwarma entree and the hummus. The portions are huge and give me three meals. The service is great."}
{"text":"We planned on going to Showmars for Sunday lunch but discovered they are closed on Sundays now. Through Yelp we found this place just a couple of miles away. We should have been wary when parking lot was empty at 12:30 on a Sunday, but it had 4 stars with over 100 reviews so we decided to give it a try. We saw the inspection score of 96.5 as we walked in so that made us feel better. However, after sitting down, we started to notice flies everywhere, dirt under the plastic tablecloth topper, dirt on the windowsills at the tables and dirt and crumbs under the tables. The only staff member we had seen had taken our order for 3 waters but I was ready to leave. My two dining companions said we should stay. After 10 minutes, we got our waters, 2 with lemons, one without ???and one had lettuce and carrot stuck to the lemon! 2 straws??? We asked for the one glass to be replaced and another straw. Finally got that and placed our order. After 35 minutes the order arrived. We had no eating utensils so we asked for them. He brings back one set! It takes almost 10 minutes to get two more! Did he have to wash them!?! We are still the only diners in the place. After that he never checks on us again. Nothing, no refills, etc. We have to find him to get our check. I could go on and on but really it's not worth it. Bottom line is food is okay but I would just avoid the place."}
{"text":"BEWARE they changed the menu.  Be sure to ask prior to ordering anything, because they are upcharging.    *Note to the owner:  update your menu and inform your customers of the changes.  1. They still have the old menu in the restaurant.  2. They still have the old menu on Yelp. 3. They still have the old menu online.  The person who runs the joint is a nice guy, I wish he was there to explain the changes.    Lekabob is literally one metro stop or 1.4 miles away....there are other options!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Great vegetarian dishes and fresh food. The Hummus tastes night and day from what you would buy from the supermarket."}
{"text":"What a welcome addition to the number of quality ethnic restaurants opening in the University area.  While some have catered more towards college students, a handful have raised their standard to the emerging professionals nearby.  Lazeez is a moderately priced, white table cloth sit down offering daily specials along with familiar eastern Mediterranean fare.  Monday lunch special is a lamb shank on a bed of kabsa rice.  The flavors are well-developed, a little spicy, but easily tamed with the yogurt side sauce.  My server,  Iris, was as charming as any newcomer could be and helped with the menu and side selections.  Lazeez is a great compliment to Sithara and Le Kebab Grille.  I say let's support quality and give 'em a whirl!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Lazeez for lunch wanting to get a good gyro. I did not get a good gyro. On the web site they have pictures of big spits of delicious looking gyro meat and amazing looking salads and what not. The actual gyro was previously frozen meat slices you would find in the frozen section of a store. The lettuce was brown and wilted and the tomatoes not quite ripe. I wanted to get a greek salad with the gyro but the waitress said you could no longer do that and all their wraps and sandwiches only come with fries now. That is not what it says on their website but what ever didn't even try to say I could do that for a few dollars more just I could not do that. I am really disappointed as I could of gone to several places very close by and gotten a real gyro and even my greek salad. I have seen this location as several different restaurants and I don't this Lazeez will have better staying power. At least not with this kind of food."}
{"text":"Everything I ordered was delicious!!!! Tried turkish coffee for the first time and it was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"We came from the mountains for a concert and fell into Lazeez thanks to Yelp. The owners were very friendly and incredibly generous. The buffet was incredible, even tho we couldn't identify most of the dishes!  The entrees were all excellent as well as the sides. Fabulous dessert. Great and friendly service.  Also a Hooka after dinner if you wish. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Walked in the door on a thursday at 9:55pm to order for takeout. The woman said they are closed. But the door is still open and on the front door broad as day it says \"Open 7 days a week 11am to 11pm\" plus the light in window said open. The little girl couldnt even talk to me about conflict in hours without walking away. If you cant honor your hours as a business, you need to hire dependable employees or dont open ur doors at all. Be more professional."}
{"text":"Loveeee this place. We had been passing it on the road for a while and finally decided to stop in. The food is authentic and delicious and the service was great as well. The waiter and waitress are really down to earth and seemed to actually take pride in their jobs. The hookah is nice and reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"I waited a month to try this place with my husband. While I enjoyed my falafel special sandwich, we were flabbergasted they were out of the lamb shawarma my husband had looked forward to trying. Pause at that.....out of lamb? The chicken shawarma was just mediocre; he described it as bland. Also, both our drinks went to empty before our waitress came to refill (we were her only table on a Saturday afternoon). It will take great convincing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"Lazeez was great! The falafel and baba ganoush were the best I have ever had and the chicken and shawarma over rice was good too. The staff was incredibly nice and the service was great!"}
{"text":"The smoothies aren't that great, had the citrus and tropical thunder. The citrus was to sour the tropical was warm and thick with a very heavy banana flavor, both of which I wouldn't order again. The food was wonderful, had the lamb mutton I think it was called and the kabobs.the humus was delicious, the kabobs were excellent and so was the lamb, didn't care for all the bones though. Other than that my only complaint is the food was all brought out at the same time. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Cuisine is somewhat different than Western Cuisine.  My wife and I are planning a trip to Israel early next year and she is paranoid that she's not going to find anything to eat. Keep telling her that everything will be fine and she is going to enjoy a new experience.  To give her a reference point, we went to Lazeez Mediterranean Grill near the University several weeks ago. Being somewhat familiar with Greek we were able to identify several items that sounded familiar.  My wife started out with Yalandji Dolma which is stuffed grape leaves with rice, tomato, onion and mint and also Baba Ghanouj which is Grilled Eggplant with Tahini etc.  I had the Lamb Kabobs and also ordered the Baba Ghanouj (GHanoush) as my  main course.  To start however, I had a complimentary bowl of Lentil Soup.  While we waited for our meal, we had occasion to observe the restaurant. Very nicely appointed with nice touches of the middle east.  TV's were tuned to Soccer.  Our server was excellent and we could not have asked for better service.  My Lentil Soup arrived first and it was delicious. Nice delicate flavor with a lot of texture to the soup as well.  Our main course came our a few minutes later. My wife liked her stuffed Grape Leaves but did not care for the Baba Ghanoush. Said it was too bitter.  My lamb kabobs were excellent. Best I have had in a long time since I went home with my Lebanese Room Mate in College.  I had never had the Baba Ghonoush before and initially I found it somewhat bitter but I ate most of it and the more I ate, the more I liked it.  Today despite the fact that I found it somewhat bitter initially, I looking forward to the next time I dine on it.  Must be an acquired taste.  Everything was very good but give my palette time to adjust and I'll probably rate it higher."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to devouring authentic Mediterranean food! The pita was hard (in fact more like Pita chips). I'd ordered a lamb kebab wrap, how I wish the meat was a little less chewy! Ambience is great for family luncheons, hospitality is great as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for a date night. I had checked the menu online and planned on ordering a la carte but when we arrived the buffet looked so delicious that we both decided to have that instead. The hummus was delicious, and the lentil soup was dense, substantial, and very tasty. There was a large selection of courses and we both loved everything we got. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not crowded noon Friday.  Disappointed that lamb shawarma was not available, so went with lamb kabob wrap with the recommended soup. Soup was delightful and I will add the name once I look at the menu again.  Wrap took about 15 minutes, and was hot and delicious. Preceded by complimentary appetizer consisting of homemade crackers with tomato paste dip ( slightly spicy).  Offered complimentary coffee and I gleefully accepted. Turned out to be Jordanian coffee with \"hell\" (cardamom).  I had not had this since I was in Israel 4 years ago. Very pleasant end to a satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious food, wonderful change from the ordinary. Courteous and friendly staff, food arrived quickly and was very good. Highly recommend to to those who want to try something different. The baklava was incredible!"}
{"text":"Baba ganoush was amazing.....sweet smoky flavor. Dolmades also excellent. Tomato \"salsa\" was the best....tomato, corriander and chips.  Will def visit again!"}
{"text":"Got delivery. Lamb shawarma and chicken shawarma wraps. Came with about 10 french fries. Wrap was mediocre."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised...we walked in with low expectations based on the number of cars in the parking lot.  Boy were we surprised, the food was absolutely delicious, everything was very tasty and well seasoned.  Our server was very good and took the time to explain everything and answer all of our questions. The service was top notch and the prices were great.  I have gone to many other Mediterranean restaurants in Charlotte but this one was definitely the best...I will absolutely be going back."}
{"text":"I'll do this in sequence: we sat for several minutes before getting water. My tabouleh salad came before anything else, including our appetizer and my husband's salad. Next came my entree and our appetizer. Then my husband's entree after that. Strange. The tabouleh had very little bulgar and tons of greenery. Much like the Costco tabouleh I stopped buying. Coincidence? The hummus was good! I ordered the lazeez burger which was lamb/beef. It was on a full size bun but the burger was just a bit bigger than a slider. It also had raw onion which in pretty sure was not listed on the menu. The fries with it were crinkle cut freezer fries. My husband's chicken special was quite dry. The salad dressing was strangely vegetal but not tasty.   Lastly, the place has an identity crisis. There's a large speaker outside blasting music with a cornhole set. Inside is more formal with ivory high back leather chairs and tablecloths (albeit with plastic covers). This spot is not on my future dining list."}
{"text":"This place has alsome food . I have pictures too. Mandi  chicken rice soooooo yommmy. They give large portions for the cheap price. Take me two three days to eat all if it. For first time I was very impressed.  Blacava. Was yummy too."}
{"text":"The ambience is extremely nice for date nights or simply going to get dinner! Delicious flavors. They also have a patio but it was rainy the day we went. Great Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Lazeez was absolutely fantastic! We had the gyro wrap, gyro plate, Turkish kabob, hummus, and Greek salad. Everything tasted incredible. The gyro meat was sliced so thinly and seasoned to perfection. The atmosphere was clean and bright. We enjoyed our experience thoroughly and will be back. Our waitress, Marlene, was a joy. She was attentive and answered all our questions. Our only note would be to reconsider the music. We wish it had been a bit more subtle in the background."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent customer service.  Chicken Shawarma was fantastic and garlic sauce was on point."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! The staff was incredibly accommodating and the food was authentic and delicious. Complimentary starter and Arabic coffee to end my lunch. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Great tasty food. Ordered the Chicken Kabob and Gyro wraps, took 20 mins. worth the wait tho. The hummus is just good, not the greatest but okay if your craving hummus. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"I'll have to share that this review is based on a take out experience, I actually didn't eat in, and not sure that I will considering it's so close to a similar restaurant with a similar variety of food.  Prices here are about run of the mill for Middle Eastern food.  If you want a chicken/beef/lamb shwarma with rice or the wrap version, they have this as many similar restaurants do.  The rice was on point that my husband got, as was his chicken.  I got the shwarma wrap and it wasn't what I was used to, so I felt like it was a wasted yummy meal.  The french fries were also cold, not crispy at all and soggy.  A plus is location, this place is close to the now booming University area and it's right off 29.  You may miss it, but it's in walking distance to one of the new light rail spots.  I'll give it a 3 because I felt it was eeeeeeeh."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! I've stopped in for dinner on 2 separate recent occasions while in Charlotte on business. The atmosphere seems a little dated but the food and the service can't be beat. My waitress was great; very friendly and helpful. I will definitely make this a regular stop when I travel to Charlotte.  I ordered the chicken kebab and falafel both times; both are terrific. I also enjoyed the lentil soup. The coffee is also very good (and unusual). It's light and brewed with a variety of spices; almost like tea. Its a nice end to a nice dinner. I look forward to trying some other items on the menu next time.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"We did order take out so our experience will not be the same if you dined in. Staff were very friendly and the online menu was a breeze. The food was good, we had the chicken shawarma and the falafel wrap, I guess we are used to more spices and maybe next time we need to add that into the comments of the online menu"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic food. We had falafel and chicken shawarma pita wraps. Great portion size for what you pay. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Will be back very soon to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Food was only ok. Greek salad would have been more Greek with a bottle of Thousand Island Greek dressing! Hardly any green lettuce. Don't know what it was; probably iceberg. Threw in a few kalamata olives and some feta and wallah ... Greek salad."}
{"text":"Stopped by while on a business trip in the area. The dining room was fairly empty for 6:45pm on a Wednesday night. Experienced very good service.  On this dining alone adventure, I had the falafel wrap with a side fattoush salad. I thought both were ok, neither great or spectacular. Yes, portions are large and prices are reasonable. But, I wasn't wowed enough by the food to warrant a second trip. I did try the Citrus Splash drink and it was delicious! Interior could use an upgrade."}
{"text":"We were in the university area around lunch time and had read so many good reviews we had to stop.  Overall it was good and would like to try it again.    Food -   So many options on the menu.  Everything looked so good.  The waitress was helpful with our questions and help narrow it down.  So here is what we decided on:  - Combination appetizer.  We picked Hummus, Dolmades and Falafels.   I would say that the Dolmades were the best.  They practically melted in your mouth.  Hummus was second best that had a very smooth consistency.  Finally the Falafel.  Personally I think that it was a little over done.   - Chicken Swarma wrap.  My wife had this and thought it was good.  I had a bite  and thought it was also good.    - Gyro Wrap.  This was my second choice as they didn't have Lamb Swarma.  Not sure how that happens but the Gyro was good.  The meat wasn't as seasoned as what I have had in the past but it was good.    Service-   So we were pretty disappointed with the service.   The restaurant was moderately busy but they only had one waitress.  I don't blame her because she was running the entire time.   It's really bad that she was put in that situation.    Overall I would try it again.  Probably would try an entree next time (waitresses original suggestion)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's family is Turkish and because of this I've had some great exposure to authentic Mediterranean foods. Lazeez offers an amazing mix of dishes from the Mediterranean. True, authentic flavors.  We ordered the Dolma (stuffed grape leaves) and a large Hummus to start. The dolma was ok, just a little too oily for me. The hummus was FANTASTIC. I could have eaten an order of that for my dinner. It was served with some pita bread that was a little flat and stale. I wasn't sure if it was old or if it was intentional (maybe a certain style of pita?) but to be honest, the hummus tasted so good I could've just eaten it straight. For dinner I ordered a chicken mandhi dish with yellow rice (cooked in the same spices as the chicken) and steamed vegetables. I used the veggies to eat up more hummus (BECAUSE IT WAS AMAZING) and ate about half of my chicken. It fell right off the bone and was a great flavor, just maybe not my most favorite. I would be interested in trying the kabob trio next time. My boyfriend gave be a bite of his lamb and it was incredible. Again, next time I would just make a different choice.   We ended with a little Jordanian coffee which was so lite, almost like a tea. It was delicious!  Atmosphere is QUIET. A little too quiet. The restaurant was almost empty but we were still seated directly behind the only other couple there. Next time I'd opt for a little more space!"}
{"text":"The dishes were so blank. Falafel was good though. Other than that the buffet was a disappointment"}
{"text":"When I first walked in, I felt like this place was going to be the ultimate ticket.  The atmosphere is alluring, with soft creamy colors and long draperies and hooka pipes. It looked trendy.  The menu was chock full of what looked like fabulous selections.   I ordered the chicken shawarma over hummus.   I always compare to what I consider the standard for Mediterranean food, which is the Jasmine Grill. The chicken was dry and hard to chew here.   The pita bread tasted like cardboard, so said my lunch companion.  And she was right.  At the Jasmine Grill, it is so piping warm and fresh that you just want to shovel it down your throat!   So, I was excited to have my friend try the Palestinian dessert, Knafeh. When I tried to order it, I was told that they didn't have the ingredients to make it. NOT GOOD!   Finally, there were a few other things that I noticed that made me wonder about this restaurant's potential to survive.   The menu said that tea refills were limited to just ONE.  Not good and I have never seen this before.   I was still thirsty and wanted more! There were no other lunch patrons dining in.  The Jasmine Grill is always full.  There were light fixtures burned out and the laminate flooring was in bad repair.   With all these things, there is no way this restaurant will survive.  They need to really up their game to stay in the game.  Sorry, but I am just not feeling this place.  At all."}
{"text":"We visited today for the first time and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was great and so was the service. I'm only sorry I didn't take pictures."}
{"text":"*Unfortunately this is a review based on what I saw after grabbing my takeout walking out to my car not the food. Word of advice: If you plan on bringing in 6 cans of RAID don't bring it through the front door. Yes, this is exactly what I saw. So the food was ruined for me before I could even open it. After seeing one of the workers do this I will never eat here again. Ever. That was disgusting. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"This definitely went above and beyond my expectations. The food was amazing and the service was quick. I had the chicken shawarma wrap which was the best one I've ever had. I had the hummus which was so fresh, the tabouleh salad, in the words of my friend, was \"pretty damn good.\" We both got the baklava which was the icing on the cake. I'll definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"I ordered a beef burger and it was delivered with Soggy buns with a water like sauce dripping in what looks like might have been from the lamb but it wasn't something that doesn't look like beef wouldn't refund money. Considering there only a block away from la kebab"}
{"text":"The food didn't have that flavor, they didn't have fresh bread for the table without a charge. I went to this place in Matthews on John Street next to the Post Office and they had free bread (as much as you like) and large portions unlike this Lazeez Mediterian Grill.  The Lentil soup had no flavor, it was bland. The lamb was dry & hard, like it had been kept from a day or so earlier.  Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. The waitress was warm and hospitable. She made us feel so welcomed and seemed genuinely interested in us enjoying every aspect of our experience. The owner came over a couple times and was gracious and passionate. The food was really amazing; authentic and perfectly seasoned. We started with a pot of the Turkish coffee which was the best we've ever had; aromatic and fresh. We then enjoyed a combo app of the dolmas, baba ganoush, and falafel. Shear perfection. You could taste each ingredient and all the subtle spices. Nothing rushed here...everything cooked and prepared with tradition and love. My husband got the lamb shank and it was exactly what you want from a lamb shank. Fall off the bone tender meat full of slow cooked flavor. My son had the roast chicken which was tender and flavorful without being overspiced. The rice that accompanied each of their dishes was amazing; full of warm, autumn spices. I had a chicken Korma wrap which was satisfying and beautifully seasoned. Again, they pay great attention to the balance of spices they use. They offer a buffet Thur-Sun which we can't wait to check out. This lovely restaurant is hardly convenient to us as its a good 45 min drive, but so very worth it. We will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Probably it was my worst experience at this restaurant. We ordered kebab chicken with white rice. We waited more than an hour. The waitress kept telling us that the white rice is ready, but toward the end she proclaimed that the white rice is never going to be ready. She finally brought yellow rice which tasted like dirt, it could have been leftover from the night before. It was dry, tasteless and hard, couldn't get down without a big gulp of water.    I never come to this restaurant again. The owner of the restaurant a lady in hijab was yelling on the phone outside window and her son was prowling across the aisle and out the front with a bottle of beer in his hand.  The waitress who I assumed was the daughter of the owner was kind. She at least showed us her tattoos and had it not been for her tattoos I wouldn't have given her a tip."}
{"text":"After craving a gyro quite fierce-like, I cruised around yelp to find who may satisfy my craving. I came across Lazeez's yelp page. Reviews look great. So I ordered a gyro and french fries on the EAT24 app. When I got to the restaurant, it was quite empty. Only two customers were dining at the time. The place looked very clean, but quite dark. The owners walked up to me with a very friendly smile and asked could they help me. I told them I was there to pick up an order made online. They asked my name, and handed me the food. The gyro was very good. The pita was quite fresh and soft. The tzatziki sauce tasted homemade and fresh. The fries were somewhat bland, needed salt. For a quick carryout order, I found that Lazeez was a pretty good option. I'd like to visit for a sitdown meal to get the full \"flavor\" of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place relatively close by and came across this gem. When we walked in we were immediately greeted and sat.  Ambience  The interior is nice with white linens and roomy booths and tables. It also does hookah if your interested but they keep it outside and separated from diners.  Alcohol I was told because it is Halal they do not provide alcohol BUT you can bring your own! So we brought a nice bottle of red from home and that definitely kept our bill way down.  Food Appetizers- We ordered the small baba ghanouj, stuffed grape leaves and kibbeh for starters. It was all very fresh and flavorful, the meat in the kibbeh was delicious and warm with a nice crispy outside. The baba ghanouj came with a lovely swirl of olive oil and fresh herbs sprinkled on top with warm toasted pita. The portions were very generous for such a low price. Those two of the 3 were definitely my favorite. I would have liked if the grape leaves were served a little warm with a bit more spice in the mix but that's just me.  Dinner- I had the mixed grill kabob that came with chicken, beef and lamb and for my two sides chose yellow rice and veggies. My husband ordered the grilled lamb chops and was suggested by waitress to order the mandi/white rice and the molokhia soup as a \"gravy\" to pour over rice and lamb.  Everything came out hot and was amazing. Large portions, the spices in the meat made my mouth sing! My husband who is not adventurous at all when it comes to food cleaned his plate and said the lamb was very tender and very flavorful. Everything had a wonderful, fresh, light char grill to it without overcooking or taking away from flavors of meat and spices. Even the rice was light and fluffy with just the right amount of seasoning to make it special. You can tell they really put care into the food and want everything you experience to be delicious . Dessert We were too full to eat dessert there so we ordered 2 baklava to go. We ate them later when we got home and oh my goodness, such delicate layers of phyllo between a very nice balance of honey, cinnamon and nuts it was a delicacy all it's own Service- Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. I really appreciated that she knew the food had n menu and had good suggestions for pairing certain sides with our courses. Nothing turns me off more than when I try a new place and ask for suggestions and get a blank stare or they say they really can't tell me cause they've never tried the food. She knew what she was talking about and her suggestions were spot on.  Because we were able to bring our own wine from home, 3 appetizers, 2 massive main courses and 2 desserts only came to $60! You seriously cannot beat that for that kind of service and quality of food. We will definitely be back here, and hope to see more people try this new place , they are such a breath of much needed fresh air in the University area. I think it's safe to say Charlotte has definitely reached its quota for BBQ and Burger joints, This authentic Mediterranean is a very welcome change!"}
{"text":"Best chicken shwarma in Charlotte. Portion size is very, very generous as well. The service we received from Marlene was outstanding. We will definitely be back frequently."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in charlotte period. The hookah is the best in charlotte. No one comes close to packing the hookah as good as this place. Would recommend it over king tut any day. Me and my friends come multiple times per week for hookah and food."}
{"text":"Wildly inconsistent. We've tried Lazeez six or seven times now and the experiences have swung between incredible and terrible. After our last experience we will not be back unfortunately. First couple of meals (shwarma, kofta, falafel, hummus, etc...) ranged between so-so to good. Then we had a few excellent meals where the same dishes were clearly made by a different chef - fresh, well cooked, perfectly seasoned, vibrant flavors - definitely the best middle eastern food we've had in Charlotte. Then the next time we get the same dishes - meat is very dry, vegetables are wilted, old, falafel is tough and flavorless, the schug is not schug but just a bottled hot sauce. Garlic sauce all of a sudden is something closer to mayo with some garlic thrown in. It's really impossible to know what you'll even get. We were still willing to keep going back because of the few truly exceptional meals we had, until our most recent experience where everything in our take-out order except the hummus looked like it had been thrown together with leftovers - it was a low they hadn't hit before. On top of that my companion was eating the kofta and found a big piece of sharp metal in it. We just threw all of the food away after that. We are willing to put up with a lot and mistakes happen, but when you can see how sloppy and careless and poorly made the food is, then find sharp objects in it, you just have to wonder what other ways did they mishandle our food? Just how sloppy is this kitchen? We have a theory that there are likely two different chefs and one is clearly far more experienced and talented. It's just so hard to believe that the meals we've had could've all been made by the same person. Two stars for the two really good meals we had...but we definitely won't be back this time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! The babaganoush wad delicious.  I also had the kofta wrap and it was very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here and the food is amazing! The service was great too! Authentic and absolutely delicious. We definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. It's Very authentic. And the people are friendly. Meat was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"So I was super excited to try this place, based on the amazing reviews. I was definitely steered wrong! The staff were nice enough but very disorganized. We were approached several times for refills but not brought anything. I ordered the Friday special which was some lamb dish. I was told it came with \"soup\". The \"soup\" was the sauce that the \"lamb\" was cooked in. Super salty, no real flavor. I used numerous containers of tzsaki sauce to make it edible. I was brought real \"soup\" as a consolation prize. It was flavorless lentil. The waitress asked me if I liked my meal. I told her no. I basically paid $15 for a flavorless bowl of lentil soup."}
{"text":"I have tried many different entrees from Lazeez. It has very decent quality! Their lamb shank is amazing. Felafel special sandwich is a must try. Their kabobs are good and their side options is just so diverse. Lazeez stands superior to all the restaurants of the same category, in terms of quality and service, at least in the university area."}
{"text":"Excellent hummus and shrimp kabobs. Staff is friendly and accomodating. Try the desserts."}
{"text":"What an amazing service by all the staff members. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. The food is just amazing.  Fresh, flavorful, and delicious !! Falafel, chicken shawarma , shrimp kabobs, lebonah dip, and hummus are few of the dishes we had tried. The best sauce is the garlic sauce.  It will give a nice flavor and kick to any dish. I am already looking forward to going their again. Please also try their double apple mint hookah.  Perfect way to chill and enjoy !!"}
{"text":"I was in the are for a Healthcare Class at the Hilton and I yelped and this restaurant came up. I love Mediterranean food and this place doesn't disappoint. The waitress told me and my colleague that Lazeez means Delicious and it sure was delicious! We started out with the Citrus Spark drink- similar to a virgin mojito. We shared the combination appetizer and loved the faffal and grape leaves. The faffal was the best I have had in years and gluten free! Also got the chicken kabob Greek salad. The fresh olives!!! And the chicken was tender. The finishing touch is they offered  complimentary cardamom tea to settle the meal! As a tea lover that sealed the deal! So good! I highly recommend this place the next time you are nearby."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how fresh and tasty the food was. Ordered hummus and then chicken kabobs with rice and would recommend them highly."}
{"text":"Husband and I ordered take out-  gyro, chicken Schwarma sandwich with fries and small hummus. Both sandwiches were good. Not great but solid. Fries were a bit limp. Hummus was creamy and tasty. Overall a solid meal."}
{"text":"A Saudi friend recommended Lazeez to me, and boy, he was spot-on! The food is absolutely delicious and service is stellar. My husband and I both ordered the chicken shawarma entree. We chose baba ganoush and hummus as our sides. I also ordered a small side salad. The meal started with a complimentary spicy salsa and pita chips. It was delicious. The baba ganoush though - OMG - BEST baba ganoush I've ever tasted. The hummus was also delicious, but the baba ganoush - divine! The chicken schawarma was perfectly seasoned, and the rice was perfection. The side salad with house lemon dressing was the perfect complement to the chicken. Portions were so large that I had enough left for the next day's lunch! The Jordanian coffee at the end was an ideal way to end this outstanding meal. We will def make Lazeez a regular on our dining out list."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Great service! Our family enjoyed all of the exotic items we ordered ...the Dolmas were out of this world.  The kids loved the fresh juices."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Kabobs were a hit. The hookah hit the spot! Brand new and just opened. Owner is awesome as well! Check it out!"}
{"text":"0 Stars, worst food and complete Frauds, Do not place order online for this merchant !  they will overcharge you! and will not deliver the order you made,  you will get zero response from the establishment."}
{"text":"The food was terrific! I always look for Mediterranean food when traveling because I am vegan. This was everything that I had hoped it was going to be.  The ambiance is not exactly the best, but with food and service this great, who cares! The Baba and the falafel were awesome!"}
{"text":"Very good food, and very tentative service! The chicken shawarma is absolutely amazing, I get it every time."}
{"text":"Went to Lazeez with a friend to check out this new spot in the University Area  We ordered a large hummus appetizer. The pita bread they had was the type you get in the Middle East, very soft and thin (unlike greek pita)  The Hummus itself was fresh and had a great taste to it. Very creamy as well !  Management and our waitress (Marlene) was super nice and accommodating !"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mediterranean restaurant. Lamb was excellent and had the best baklava I have ever had. Definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Been here first time with my family. Food was really good. Nice flavour. Side i asked was  vegetable that was not upto mark, oter than that every thing was nice"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the Chicken Mandi. The rice was well cooked but the Chicken didn't seem to be fresh. It was stinky."}
{"text":"Yelp will tell you that you can order delivery from this place. Don't do it. It took 1:45 for our food to arrive, and when it did, it wasn't the right order. Seriously, just do not order delivery from here. Honestly, it might be fine otherwise, but you can't come between my wife and her tzatziki."}
{"text":"Everything we had today was very good from hummus to lamb, chicken, falafel... Coffee with cardamom was delicious! And home made baklava is a must! Waitress was very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a meal through Postmates and my food was prepared quickly therefore it was delivered just as fast. The Chicken Mandi is a good portion for one person with a price point of $10 and it tastes amazing!  I look forward to visiting the restaurant in the near future!"}
{"text":"Bad food, expensive and terrible service! I'm writing this review because I ended here because of other reviews and it was terrible. Bad food quality, the service is terrible you have to ask for everything because the waiter don't do anything to make your visit pleasant. It was expensive compare to other Mediterranean restaurants around. Don't eat here!!!"}
