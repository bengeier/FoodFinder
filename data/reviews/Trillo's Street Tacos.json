{"text":"We had the street tacos, corn and a taco salad. All were so very good! Manny was very personable and when he accidentally put onions on our street tacos he gave us 3 more for free. Will be back!! Best street tacos and corn on the west side of town!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that is in a gas station fool you. The food is absolutely amazing!  By far the best street tacos we have ever had.  We also had the chorizo breakfast burrito....amazing!"}
{"text":"Read about this place on FB.  Came out from Henderson to try it and it was very worth it.  Family owned and run and worth the trip.  Plan on stopping by whenever I'm on this side of town and sometimes will just make the trip for good tacos."}
{"text":"Great food...the Mexican corn is out of this world!!! Owner is very friendly and accommodating. Was a little hesitant being inside a gas station but the food was amazing, very clean....highly recommend"}
{"text":"The best part of this place. Are the owner's amazing people. Great tasty food! It definitely worth coming again and again!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice already & these both times we have arrived they have been closed. No help from the cashier cause they never know whats going on. Don't lie & say you're hours are open online when they aren't. It's frustrating & a waste of time to come in. Poor hours. Poor service.

*UPDATE*

Came AGAIN at 3pm on a SATURDAY and they WERE STILL CLOSED. Nonsense."}
{"text":"Ate at Trillo's Street Tacos for the 1st time Thursday, June 14, 2018, with my friend Q. I ordered the carna asada street tacos and they were amazing. Not very many restaurants season their carna asada correctly, but Manny knows what he is doing. I will definitely go back an eat there again."}
{"text":"The burrito was huge, filling, and tasty and came with tortilla chips and three salsas (in the to-go box) for about $5. The food is comparable to Roberto's Taco Shops, but Roberto's does not include chips in their orders.

They received 4 stars because the ordering took awhile. There were two people working by the counter and I was the customer. Both of them were on their phones so I had to wait 3-5 minutes to place my order. They made it immediately so I was out the door in about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Very good ! Lots of flavor very nice owner as well will tell family and friends about this joint! Thanks agian"}
{"text":"While in Vegas to celebrate a milestone, my wife and I had a strong desire for some street tacos. A Google search generated a bunch of Mexican restaurants on the strip. However, we were both exhausted and not in the mood to deal with the inescapable hustle and bustle associated with the strip. A quick Yelp search for \"hot and new\" restaurants revealed a Mexican restaurant called Trillo's Street Tacos.
 
My Google Maps navigation led us to a small business complex with a Arco AMPM gas station on the corner. After a quick survey of the business complex, we realized that the restaurant was located within the AMPM. To be honest, we were both skeptical of the setup. In my experiences, restaurants located within gas stations (even well-established businesses such as Burger King) have an indescribable generic, mediocre taste (or maybe it's a mental thing). However, we were both starving so Trillo's Street Tacos it was!
 
When we walked up to the register we were warmly greeted by one of the owners (the business is owned by a couple). She took our orders (two Ground Beef nachos and four chicken street tacos) and gracefully accepted my Yelp offer for a free street taco upon \"check in (woot woot!).\" A little over ten minutes later our food was ready.
 
The nachos were delicious and were prepared using homemade chips (the difference between homemade chips vs. prepackaged chips is substantial). The large portion size of the nachos did not allot for any room to eat our street tacos (therefore I can't provide a review for the street tacos).
 
If you're looking for good Mexican food in Vegas, stop by Trillo's Street Tacos!"}
{"text":"I wish we could give 10 stars cuz I would this food is delicious flavorful and it was piping hot when it arrived my new favorite Mexican food place they make Roberto's look like McDonald's smh the absolute bomb"}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing! Awesome customer service..can't wait to come back and try the street corn"}
{"text":"Great tacos, fast service but NOT \"fast food\".  Its made to order, really awesome tacos!  Highly recommended, gotta try it if you like street tacos, best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Tbh I wasn't sure what to expect when I got here when I realized it was inside of a gas station. It popped up as hot and new on yelp when I was on the way to the DMV so I decided to give it a try. 

I ordered some carne asada, chicken, and carnitas street tacos and an order of the street corn.. literally all delicious! I would say that my favorite was the carnitas tacos.. yum! 

The guy working there was very friendly. He rang us up as well as cooked the food. He did a great job. 

Wish thing place was closer to me, but def will be back if in the area. Def come check it out :)"}
{"text":"So, I really wanted to give a high rating to this place as the owners seem to be very nice people and provide great service. I appreciate that I can see how hard they work at keeping everything fresh. With that said, the food is simply under salted and boring! Everything from the salsa, to the chips to the carne asada meat was blah.  I wish these folks the best but, probably would not go there again."}
{"text":"My street corn was absolutely amazing. Already craving another!!!! Service was good as well. Very happy."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight I wish I would have stopped in here and tried them sooner this will be our go to taco shop from now on. Food was great and service was excellent my family was really impressed with everything!!!"}
{"text":"Yay, a place nearby where we can satisfy our \"Mexican street food\" cravings! This place is legit! Ginormous taco salads, carnitas tacos, elotes, and Sonoran hot dogs. Very reasonable for the big portions. 
Pro tip: ask for extra spice on your elote."}
{"text":"Found them on restaurant.com and very happy with the food. It was good and the portions were just right. I got the asada taco bowl and it was big! We ordered the asada quesadilla and asada burrito and the street corn! The corn was perfect! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Went in to pay for fuel and found this gem. Omg, the street corn, the best I've ever had. The wings and fries were very tasty as well. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the items on the menu. It will be my favorite stop for gas,lol!"}
{"text":"I work at the salon behind this place and we eat here ALOT. Everything is delicious and fresh!!  It's very clean and the owners are just your regular hard working Americans doing something they love.  So happy they are so close!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Went there right when they were closing up and Instead of turning us away they helped us! We didn't have a small order either! Lovely people! And their food HOLY MOLY!! The carne asada was so so so good one of the best I have ever had!!! The elote(corn) was TO DIE FOR!!! Def will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! At first we were hesitant being that the shop is in a gas station, but we weren't disappointed. Will definitely  come back."}
{"text":"This place is has some of the best street tacos and Mexican corn ever. The customer service is the best. Manny I wish more businesses had your personality thanks again. See you soon"}
{"text":"I had to stop at the gas station for something. I noticed the Trillo street tacos. I was in a hurry and thought I would grab a bite on the run from there. I wasn't expecting much. I was very pleasantly surprised. The two gentleman at the counter were extremely friendly, asked if it was my first time there, and took the time to explain the menu. I didn't even have to Ask. I paid for my Carne Asad a tacos and went back out to my car to finish up. I came in after I was done. My food was waiting for me and the owner thanked me personally. The real surprise came when I bit into the food. I actually had to pull over and eat them because I didn't want to wait any longer. The taste was that good. It was fresh and delicious. If I hadn't had to be somewhere in would have turned around and gotten 3 more. I will definately go back, probably in the next couple of days."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST Street tacos in Vegas!! 
My husband and I love to drive around and try new places.... well, we came across Trillo's Street Tacos and we love it! Keep in mind we live by the Southwest so it is a far drive however we have tried almost every item on their menu, never disappointed. Both my son and daughter loves the  Sriracha fries, my husband favorite is the Street Carnitas tacos ( let me add that he is very picky and won't eat any carnitas  tacos, well he keeps coming for more!) and I could eat the Carne Asada Quesadilla all day! With our respective Mexican Corn to go and the BEST  part is that they have a grade \" A \" ( so we don't have to worry about our kids getting sick, like unfortunately they've used to be after running behind the elotero guy) Customer service is amazing! This place is run by a family, very nice people, they are always on top of their game, asking if we need anything else, very attentive. I have two suggestions, #1 will be to add natural fruit waters, like mango but that's only because I love to eat my qesadillla or my tacos with my agua de mango fresca. So I'll completely understand if I don't see this in their menu since it's probably just me who will be ordering it :) Second suggestion, please open a new location by the southwest area."}
{"text":"Really friendly and quick service.  I had the corn and tacos...  very fresh and delicious food will be coming back soon!!! Highly recommend for your taco and corn  fix"}
{"text":"Great, excellent, friendly business! The best tacos I've had! Thank you I will be a repeat customer!!"}
{"text":"Such a Great Taco Spot! I had been looking for a good street Taco place and happened to stumble upon Trillo's. I got the the Tacos two asada and One chicken. the seasonings were very good and everything was so fresh! I got beans on the side with chips and a Jarritos! yumm will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner today, just looking for something simple. Got a fish taco and a few carnitas tacos. Oh wow. The fish taco was great, just hit the spot on what I was looking for. But the carnitas were amazing, really tender and fantastic flavor, probably some of the best carnitas I've had. I'll absolutely be back."}
{"text":"The type of place u don't want to tell everyone about because your afraid there won't be enough tacos for u... maybe that's just me ! On a serious note this place is a hidden gem! The location can be misleading but u forget where u are until u get thirsty at which point your conveniently located inside ampm !"}
{"text":"Best street tacos in town!!! Check this place out for sure.  Helpful, friendly people, and try the street corn!"}
{"text":"I was very skeptical at first cuz it's a little sketchy on the outside. The owners were so friendly and nice. I had carnitas tacos. I am very picky about my carnita meat, but this was delicious. My husband had a carne asada  quesadilla and it was delicious also. Can't wait to go back and try more things"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here on a whim. From the out side I was confused. Why were we getting gas station food? WRONG. This is a classic case of don't judge a book by its cover. We ordered the street corn and fish tacos. I ate so much I could pop. The tacos are super fresh. They also make their own salsas. I can verify the verde taste amazing. The street corn was so good I ate two! I cannot recomend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Even the nachos are made to order starting by frying the tortilla chips fresh. And the street corn is amazing. My goal is to try everything on the menu. Don't let the fact that its in an Am Pm dissuade you from making this your destination. I drove across town to get some Trillo's Street Tacos specifically."}
{"text":"Our family had been looking for a good taco shop. We found this place through yelp. We had driven by before and decided to give it a try. The restaurant is connected to a gas station so we decided we would take the food home. The carne asada was SO good! We got tacos meals that came with chip and salsa. All of it was delicious and beyond my expectations. We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I would always drive by and see Trillo's Street Tacos sign and said I'd always stop by and try the tacos. Today was the day and they did not disappoint  Super friendly from the moment I placed my order and after receiving my order, Manny made sure to show my order to ensure accuracy. So happy to have found this taco spot right down the street from my house!! Will definitely come back again for more carne asada tacos!!"}
{"text":"First time there and we weren't disappointed. Everything was wonderful and very fresh. My husband had Asada tacos and I had one of each, a chicken, asada, and fish taco. I save the best for last to eat which was the fish and it was delicious!  The slaw they put in it was amazing. The only problem I had was since I ate it last, the tortilla fell apart from the lime juice and sauce. Still no complaints though because it was so good. Maybe next time I'll have them double the tortilla. We can't wait to go back and try their other items."}
{"text":"We went based on the good reviews.  It was awful.  

There were 6 chairs - 1 was totally ripped, the other one I sat on was leaning forward making me feel like I was going to fall out of it.

We ordered a burrito for $7 and Chicken Nachos for $7 - plus drinks came almost to $20 for 2 people to eat.  The gas station light was very bright and annoying and we ate our meal facing the beer cooler section - how romantic.  

My ' chicken ' nachos should have been called refried bean Nachos as there were a lot more refried beans then chicken.  The chicken was cut in TINY cubes and there were about 10 cubes on my entire huge plate of Nachos.  They were also COLD and the shredded cheese was NOT even melted.  The chips were hard, the Salsa was like water but very hot - more like Louisiana hot sauce then Salsa.  The Burrito was flavorless.  I would not go back if you were giving me the meal for free.  Employees were nice though and therefore I still tipped them a couple of $$$.
 
App. if you leave negative reviews about this place you will receive derogatory remarks to your inbox and publicly.   Guess some people don't get the concept of sarcasm."}
{"text":"Great customer service! They are always friendly and the food is good  My husband loves it!"}
{"text":"Tacos and corn are delicious and dude that works there is very friendly. Dont be fooled by the location"}
{"text":"Was great lunch!! I Had Carne tacos, were perfect!  It has a very simple menu, friendly, fast, nice owner!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat!! Customer service is excellent and they have awesome food!! Fresh at that!! Nice and friendly people and there is this one Hawaiian. Chick that is awesome  sauce!!!  WE LOVE YU TRILLO STREET TACOS"}
{"text":"This is a spot I passed over and over. DO NOT be like me and my wife stop in great food FRESH FOOD, FRESH SALSA, great service. Best tacos ive had in Las Vegas, corn is a must. This is not gas station food. Chef level tacos. Great consistency, great mixture of colors. Overall an outstanding spot."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back for more, they went out of their way to make me floor tortillas. Good business ethics and awesome good. Everyone Needs to try the Mexican corn"}
{"text":"We have a new go to taco and burrito place.  Can't
Go wrong.  Manny (owner) knows how it's done."}
{"text":"Just happened to drive by and saw the sign so I stopped and decided every day is a day for trying a new taco place. Before walking in I decided to check Yelp and saw they had an \"Buy Three Get One Free\" offer on tacos Mon-Fri. Today is Sunday and they still offered the deal to me. Awesome.

So I ordered three carne asada and one chicken taco. The meat was well seasoned and tasted great and had the perfect amount of char on it. And I felt like the amount of meat on the tacos was great. The tortillas were full, but not overstuffed. I saw other people complain about the tacos. But at roughly $2/ea, it's a damn good taco. It's not going to shoot out rainbows or cure the blues, but well worth the price you pay. 

The service was great. The lady at the counter was super nice and ordering wasn't difficult. The guy at the grill came out to ask what sauces I wanted with the Honey Sriracha fries I ordered. Which may seem stupid to some, but I think it's a great level of customer service to give a choice rather than just shove something in a bag and hope the customer likes it.

The only thing I wasn't a fan of, was the Honey Sriracha fries. I didn't really get the taste of honey OR Sriracha. Also, the fries were a little \"soft\" for my liking. But, to me, that doesn't warrant a lower rating because every place has things they make well and things they aren't as amazing. And the taste of the other food paired with the service, it's a well earned five stars from me.

Also, if you are scared to eat tacos from a place inside a gas station, you're not living. I have yet to have gas station tacos there weren't damn good!"}
{"text":"i found this place on yelp!!!!  im very picky w mexican food.  this place fulfilled and delivered in every way. down to earth owners. coming back again"}
{"text":"This spot is extremely good. I was looking for some street tacos but ended up with a Bacon wrapped burrito. An it didn't disappoint. Don't let the fact that it's in a gas station scare you from trying it."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city. Family run and it shows. Everyone is so nice and so welcoming. I highly recommend this hidden jewel."}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos ever!!! Everything is so fresh and the service is awesome!! Beans, rice, salsa! Everything was amazing!!! Definitely a must try! Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best quick tacos hands down. Just do it!!! Friendly staff, awesome food.

I tried the carne asada with guac... three tacos and tortilla chips with homemade sauces, definitely filling and delicious for the price. The horchata was also good, if you prefer it a little less sweet and less thick than usual. My friends got burritos which were massive. If you're hungry, skip the gas station snacks. Get yoself some tacos!!"}
{"text":"Needed to see what all the fuss was about, so, I decided to stop in and give the tacos and the bacon-wrapped burrito a try. I'm now swayed to be here every Tuesday when possible for the tacos and anything else on the menu. This could possibly be my new hangout...lol."}
{"text":"Where to start?! This place is amazing! It may seem a little off putting cuz it's inside a gas station but I assure you that it's the complete opposite. Since I came back from LA it's been really hard to find good tacos, burritos, and nachos. Everybody in Vegas is always like tacos el Gordo this and Roberto's that. Absolutely not! Those places are the worst to get Mexican food from. Trillos on the other hand hasn't let me down yet the owners are very friendly and genuine people. Their tacos are to die for fresh cooked asada and chicken daily, burritos are exquisite! And the nachos had me in a food coma. They even make the nachos themselves no store bought stuff at this place. I come here almost everyday for lunch as I work across the street. So if you're looking for a quick bite to eat that's satisfying go ahead and stop in you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken salad, 3 chicken tacos and street corn. Everything was fresh and tasty this was my first time here I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great flavor with just enough heat. Awesome service. Employee went above and beyond to serve us even though owner was late. Employee was new, didn't have access to the till and went ahead and made our food while we waited on owner. He was very polite and energetic in a trying situation. I Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The asada tacos and elote were really good. The owners and staff were extremely courteous and personable. I will definitely be returning when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I'll start right off by giving this place a 4 out of 5 star rating. The food was amazing and didn't leave me feeling like I had Taco Bell after it settled. That being said, there's a few things that I would change, when compared to the hundreds of other taco shops that are around the area. Keep in mind that these are just my personal opinions and in no way reflect poorly on the quality that this new restaurant has established. Being inside an AM/PM isn't that bad, with the exception of it being a complete pain in the ass to park and actually get inside. The lady at the counter was extremely nice and helpful with questions and suggestions. They were even kind enough to take our order over the phone so were weren't standing around waiting for it when we got there.

Let's give each item their own break down...

Tacos (Him):

We ordered (2) taco plates which equaled a total of (6) tacos. They came with a side of chips, green sauce, red sauce and a healthy amount of salsa. They were priced fairly at $2.00 a piece if you broke it down, which isn't bad considering you get a good sized side of chips and salsa as well with them. For me, the onions were unbearable. I always get only cilantro and onions on my tacos, but there were massive cuts. They should be chopped much finer so that it's not so overwhelming per each bite. The limes that were included where no where near ripe and had a sour taste that is far from the taste you would expect from a ripe one. The amount of meat in each taco is much appreciated. It's enough to fill you up if you have a small stomach and not leave you taking bites of tortilla that's meatless. That being said, it's no where near the amount of meat that almost every other taco shop includes in theirs. I should be able to pick that taco up and have meat falling out the other end with each bite.

Street Corn:

The Street Corn was fantastic. Not a single complaint about it. Next time, I'll be ordering more than one...

Burrito (Her):

The burrito was very good. I am a huge fan of having beans and rice in a burrito, so I'm glad it came with both. The tortilla was fried a little on the sides, which really added a nice touch to the burrito. It came with chips and salsa as well, which is really an awesome added bonus.

Salsa:

Not quite what I was expecting, nor what anyone else who tasted it was either. Hard to explain, it wasn't bad but it wasn't that traditional \"red sauce\" if that makes sense.

Overall:

The place is great. They are a new business and no one expects them to be amazing. From what I've heard, it's there first shop and they will get the kinks sorted out. If they don't... They will end up like the other taco shops who start off strong and end up being forgot really quickly (like Sin Frijoles). At the end of the day, it's just my personal opinion. Take that for what it is. I'll definitely be going back in the coming weeks to see if anything has changed and I'll update the review and hopefully kick this up to a 5 star where it belongs.

This place asked for honest feedback, so that's what I'm doing.

On a completely different note, the review from Oklahoma was written by one of the most ignorant Yelp reviewer's on here. They should have their rights to review anywhere revoked and account deleted. What in her mind would ever think that going into a gas station to get tacos would be romantic... Duh."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  Owner operator was awesome and very accommodating.  Great food!  If I lived in Las Vegas it would be a regular place for me to eat."}
{"text":"Look here and listen up. This place is awesome! My wife and I took our two sons her tonight after trying to do a sit down restaurant and we found the wait was 1 hour. Needless to say we left there and came here instead. It was a great choice! We saved about $40 bucks, the food was Fantastic, this place is clean and the staff there were super friendly. It just might have become my new favorite lunch spot. Double thumbs up to you folks."}
{"text":"I had chicken, carnitas, and asada tacos. All amazing. They're home made, and you can definitely tell. The chicken taco was my favorite and the red salsa is amazing. Coming back to try the bacon wrapped burrito!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Well seasoned meat, soft tortillas and fresh ingredients make this a good place to get your taco cravings quenched (and don't forget the salsas)!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The owners are friendly and go out of their way to make their customers happy. The corn is the best I've ever had and the tacos are amazing. Reasonable prices and generous portions. Don't let the fact that this place is inside a gas station fool you, the food is fresh and the kitchen (visible from the counter) is clean. They have a little something for every taste so I highly recommend them the next time you have a Mexican food craving!"}
{"text":"I'm going to change the review completely I just posted! I will give the owners 5 stars as the humility we all shared, with so much in common after speaking to them-  and I appreciate the willingness to come and speak to me. Goes to show alot between business owners and consumers and how human kindness goes a long way, even after bad days. Test and trials are every day  coming in any way. We are all human  and far from perfect, so I accept the apologies as I give my apology and my condolences again to you both! Thank you and Yes- The corn is Bomb- never had it with Iime, but I like it!!"}
{"text":"Ok. Lowdown.  Carnitas burrito is the best I have had in Vegas.  The place is clean. Owner is involved with quality.  I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu.  Menu is simple and not complicated.  The In n Out of tacos.  Do yourself a favor and head out here to enjoy the Mexican street food.  I hope they open one in Summerlin.  We need a locals street food taco spot in Summerlin.  Being from ELA, the Mecca of tacos and burritos! You will be pleased with the quality."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant we stumbled apon it when we ordered through grub hub. Many people talk about the best restaurant being a little hole in the wall and this is the one you will definitely add to your list. We love them so much we had them cater for my daughter's birthday and it was amazing!! The street tacos are perfect and the street corn is just like getting it off the little cart in Chicago. My company will be catering here from now on."}
{"text":"Brought a group of high schoolers from Southern California (that enjoy street tacos). They loved the tacos and the service from Manny was awesome. Don't be afraid to try them out."}
{"text":"Food was amazing ! Grub hub failed to us Big time ! They never brought our food ! I called the r stair any where THEY brought our food ! Of course food was already cold ... but even though was good !! Thank you Trillo's ! Horrible Grubhub !"}
{"text":"What an amazing little gem we found.. in the gas station! Very clean and welcoming spot. We both had carne asada burritos.. but my husbands was off the secret menu.. wrapped in bacon! Best carne asada burritos we've had. The owner was there cooking along with another lady.. they were both very friendly. We will be back for sure! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"nice n clean no to many options ground beef tacos for 99c on Tuesdays naaa no a big fan of those  lol carne asada n carnitas best way to star my day 
Well carnitad was good dost n greasy asada no to much flavor .

But you get 10% from yelp lol"}
{"text":"The service was fast and excellent. super friendly and the food was exceptional. will definitely be back! give it a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had their carnitas. After a long work week, carnitas were exactly what I needed. I had the combo and I loved the cheese on top of the beans and the chips and salsa we had were good too! I loved the green salsa. I'm such a baby with spicy food but the green salsa and pick were perfect for my palate. Thank you! I'll eventually be back for more."}
{"text":"If you want real street tacos,  this is the place! Verry authentic tacos and the service was fabulous. Very friendly just like a true taqueria shpuld be! Love it you must come try it!"}
