{"text":"Returned back to Chloe with family for dinner. We ordered more dishes to share. I love the house special baked pork chop in tomato sauce with rice. Cheese is so creamy and the sauce tastes good. My mom ordered the Portuguese baked pork chop with spaghetti. This is the first time we have tried the Portuguese sauce in Toronto. Really nice and tasty. Dad ordered the one I had last time, baked chicken fillet in spinach cream sauce with rice. No regrets at all!
It now offers traditional HK style breakfast. Will come back on weekends to try."}
{"text":"Average food quality, exceptional bad service, every time when I visited there, I asked myself why I still need to pay tips (service charge) for the waitress who provided such bad service to customers, however, no choice, 10% is compulsory.  The only reason that I went there again is my son love one (the only one) item from their menu,  for me \"no, thank you!\""}
{"text":"- My favourite dish.. Hainan Chicken Rice, it's not easy to find a place to have boneless chicken.. taste really good! Sometimes it sold out around 7pm..
- Their baked Pork Chop Rice is popular as well..
- Price increased
- Service - okay"}
{"text":"An avid Hong Kong style cafe enthusiast and this restaurant is by far my least favourite.  

Ordered beef brisket noodle soup, peppered-beef friend spaghetti, and bolegnese spaghetti...the freaken  portions were a disgrace for the price.

Both of the spaghetti came in a smallish size plate- the portion were so tiny that my 6 year old could finish.

The lady server was unpleasant as well- I don't expect any service from a Chinese restaurant but she was plain rude.  Essentially I had to show her what I wanted to oder because I could read Chinese...she made a sigh gesture because she had to read the menu...excuse the &#^/ me that I am inconveniencing her. 

Never coming back and would not recommend.

Lastly, the taste was below average at best."}
{"text":"This place used to be the Vietnamese noodle restaurant. Now becomes the Hong Kong style restaurant with a few Vietnamese dishes. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Their HK Style food like bake pork chop is good but just one pork chop. Other foods I had were all good but stay away from the German Pork Hock. The skin still had too much \"hair\" on it and the oil needed refreshing resulting the skin being brown but not crispy and had a bit of a taste of old oil to it. Killed my craving for it. And German Pork Hock is supposed to be pickled but that most places won't get right."}
{"text":"Price $$$$$^99

If there was an award for the most overpriced restaurant in Ontario, I'd nominate this place for candidacy.   Made the unfortunate choice to go  there for brunch, 2 people, spent 30$+ on two lunch specials and 1 entree.  Now I have no problem paying for decent food, but this was anything but.

First, the quantity was small, it made me questioned whether I had ordered from the toddler's menu.  I counted a grand total of 7 pieces of tiny beef tenders in my curry beef dish, which was priced at $10.99.  Wish I had taken a picture to show you guys, the portion was so tiny I seriously doubt it could feed anyone over the age of  5.  

The quality of food was nothing to write home about neither.  The so called  \"green curry\"  beef I ordered was so watered down I could barely taste any hint of curry.   In fact, they might as well rename the dish to stewed beef with vegetables, at least then customers would not feel being lied to.

The lemon tea that came with the combo was also beyond terrible.  Whoever made it must have broken the sugar jar on top, because it literately tasted like lemon syrup.   I didn't have the heart to try their soup.  Though, even the best soup in Toronto would not sway my opinion of this place at this point.  

In conclusion, go there if you are looking to feed your toddler with overpriced junk.  Otherwise, stay away."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had. I ordered a \"Black peppered steak\" for lunch. 

What arrived to our table was definitely NOT steak! It had 2 of the smallest pieces of \"beef\" I've ever seen a restaurant serve (it was literally as thin as paper, the kind you get at hot pot). Tough and inedible.

Whoever is working the kitchen at this restaurant should be ashamed, because that dish is simply humiliating to their \"chef\"."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a go for lunch as other places were completely packed. The place is clean and quite modern and there were not a lot of people eating there so we were seated right away. 

As with most Chinese restaurants, there are a number of set lunch options which range from $7-$11 and includes a free tea/ coffee (some also include soup). I personally think that the menu lacks choices and is a little on the pricier side than most other HK cafes in the area. I ordered the pork vermicelli in soup and the portions was a bit on the small side, though it was tasty. The HK milk tea was alright as well.

Service was average, typical Chinese restaurant service. Overall place is not bad but definitely scales at average compared to many other similar restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  Food was nothing spectacular.
Average quality.  
Only thing positive is the place is clean compare to other HK style restaurants"}
{"text":"Wish I can have the option of giving them 0 stars.
Food was sub-par, service was off the chart rude and inappropriate. 
While I was ordering takeout, my friend wanted to use their washroom.
One of the waitress thought he was just someone passing by wanted to borrow the washroom, and stopped him and started talking to him in a loud and rude tone. 
Asked for the manager, and the manager (name is Helena, I think) goes even further and started a shouting match with my friend. 
After a 3 minute fiasco, the manager started throwing things to the garbage can violently, and banging her kitchen stuff against the counter in front of the customers. Just pure, unmatched bad service.
Met the owner once, when it just opened, he was actually a pretty cool dude. But obviously he didn't care much for his business by hiring people like this to take care of his business.  pity. 
Never will I ever come back to this nasty restaurant again. 

I actually filmed a part of the incidence in my phone, still thinking about whether or not I should post it."}
{"text":"We came in at around 4:30pm for a HK style afternoon tea. The moment we walked in, the employees were incredibly curt despite there being absolutely no one else to serve in the restaurant. Despite their cold service, we ordered one satay beef noodles in soup and one French toast. When we requested for the noodles to be swapped for rice noodles instead of instant noodles (which mind you, is usually done at free of charge unless you're changing it to udon), she rudely told us it would cost an extra $1. We said it was fine but she still gave us attitude and added that \"our prices are already the cheapest\". This awful service continued for the entire duration of our meal. 
In terms of the food, the noodles were average and the French toast was poorly executed. They were skimpy on the eggs which made the toast very dry and non-French toast like. 
Definitely don't recommend this restaurant and would rather drive an extra 15 minutes elsewhere than come here again. 
P.S. They didn't even mention to us that we would be charged extra peanut butter on the French toast."}
{"text":"One star is well over rated.  I wish I could give negative star.  The worst food I have ever tried at a restaurant.  I ordered this pork noodle soup and they served this pasta looking noodle.  The actual noodle soup looked nothing like the picture.  $10 for 3 pieces of pork and noodles.  I don't know how any restaurant could even serve this to customers.  Good luck."}
{"text":"food was bad
taste made me sick
tasted like airplane food
had the pork neck portuguese style spaghetti
couldnt finish half of it cuz i felt nauseous  
restaurant is weird
soccer themed with chinese tv shows playing"}
{"text":"So I was pretty hesitant to try this place based on some of the reviews, but didn't find it as bad.  Pretty standard HK-style cafe fare.  Totally agreed the portions leave something to be desired, but I ordered a very basic carbonara...and I guess the creaminess of the sauce/it being a pasta helped make it more filling considering the portion size was on the small(er) side.  Also ordered a baked pork chop rice, and while it wasn't the best we've ever had, it was simple and did the job.  A passing grade overall for this establishment."}
{"text":"BlTCH This F)&$king restaurant served me f$@ckinguncooked, Nasty A$$ Pork, was probably rotting already, I didn't notice it was Still Bloody after I ate almost half of it because the sauce was also red, IT sent me to the washroom for 7 hours, yes, 7 hours and I counted... THE WAITRESS FACE IS THE BlTCHIEST FACE, I swear everytime I ask for ice she gives the most unpleasant resting BlTCH face ever, They also talk behind your back when your eating, the price is so high I can probably use that money for my college instead of sitting in the washroom for 7 hours. Please do yourself a favour and don't go to this ugly a$$ restaurant. They also demand tips, why would we give them tip if they ask for it? Service is $hit you get $hit, not to mention, they get so pissed off without tip won't go here again
Pls get ur shit together"}
{"text":"Bad service, we want to order beef brisket flat rice noodle, but would like to change to rice noodle only, the waitress said need to add $0.5, so we said go back to flat rice noodle, then she said no more flat rice noodle, what the hell at the first place you not let as know actually sold out. Her attitude was so bad and seems like to ignore us. Definitely NOT go back anymore!!

Food are not tasty as well, portion are super small, I can say their cutting skills are very good. The luncheon meat thin like a paper!!"}
{"text":"Had dined here a number of times. I do agree they probably have the best hainan chicken rice compared to the many others I've tried. But other than that dish, I've only come across major disappointments with the other dishes I've tried from this restaurant. Once had a stir fry noodle with beef with ample noodles but hardly any meat (maybe 5 extremely thin broken slices) Had a daily soup which comes with a combo that was super fishy it makes me feel nauseated. And the fried tofu that i ordered tasted sour."}
{"text":"Worst service. One of the staff was really rude. Food was ok, but not good enough to make me visit again."}
{"text":"Came here twice, first time was a typical Chinese restaurant experience, the food was good (we ordered the baked pork chop with spaghetti, and the hainan chicken) but expensive for the portion, compared to what you would typically get at an Asian restauran elsewhere in Markham.

Second time was definitely horrid. The total time we spent here was 35 minutes, in which 25 minutes was spent on waiting for our meal. The portions were miniature for the price paid. The cream sauce with ham and mushroom spaghetti didn't even have mushrooms in it, and the cream sauce had the consistency of water. We also ordered the fried pork chop bun, this took 20 minutes in which the order was asked about 3 times within that duration of time. When asked to check on the order, the waitress came back and lazily put down the order. Both meals were very bland. When waiting for the milk tea that comes with the dish, it was asked about 4 times until it finally came.
I wanted to like this place because of my first time here. But for the price and what you get it is not worth it. The servers here are either always glaring at the customers, or are completely clueless to their surroundings. Its clear the servers have had no prior experience or training when doing this job.
Needless to say, the experience here will turn your good day into a bad one."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good, never dissapoints me and their seafood rice in the stone pot is delicious, i would definitely reccomend even though the fried rice is their #1."}
{"text":"Worse Experience Ever.

If you don't mind paying extra for a teaspoon of ginger onion sauce for the Hainanese Chicken Rice, this maybe a place for you. If you want to try a chewy tasteless 0.5cm steak with black pepper sauce, no harm to go.  If you enjoy being treated badly, this is a place for you. If you are looking for an overpriced restaurant, this is definitely on your list."}
{"text":"Authentic HK Style Baked Rice and Spaghetti. Large and comfortable space with TV screens playing sports! My favourite is the Spinach Cream Sauce Chicken on Rice and Hainanese Chicken Rice  a must try. Also a great comfy place for inexpensive beer with competitive price compared to St. Louis."}
{"text":"Only 2.5 star? I thought that it would be worth at least 3. First of all, the decor is nicer than the average HK cafe. I  thought that service was quick and relatively friendly. 

The food was decent.. typical HK cafe food. What I really liked was that the Hainan chicken was served deboned!! That's awesome for a lazy eater such as myself. Thought the baked portguese dish was nice too. 

Most of the dishes come with a soup and drink. Pretty good value for under $10.

Accepts credit. Plenty of parking. I'll return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on a weekday for lunch; the place was less than 1/4 full.  We ordered from the Lunch Special Menu; the portion were relatively small.  The meal came with a choice of Russian Borscht or Chinese Melon Soup and a drink.

We choose the Russian Borscht over the Chinese Melon Soup and it tasted good; there weren't any beef brisket pieces like other restaurants would have but it had a thick taste of tomato with well cut diced cabbage, carrots, celery, onions etc.

1. House Special Baked Pork Chop in Tomato Sauce with Rice
- tender boneless pork
- nothing surprising; have tasted similar and or better at other restaurants

2. Malaysian Curry Beef Brisket with Rice
- the curry had a darker colour than normal HK style curry; it had a heavier taste of herbs causing a bittery aftertaste
- it was not sweet, nor spicy; the Malaysian curry at Phoenix is way better

3. Pan fried Chicken and Pork Chop in BBQ sauce (??) with Rice
- the sauce tasted like some kinda mushroom sauce cooked with bell peppers instead
- it served with a piece of chicken and pork chop; it was tender but each was relatively small

Service:  Avoid the older women as your server; I asked if the Malaysian Curry contain peanut because some restaurants do, she seemed uncertain.  So I made sure she understood I had peanut allergies and told her to double check with the chef.  She seemed very obnoxious. Whats wrong with her?  As a server you are expected to answer questions your customers offer; you may not understand the ingredients in each dish since you are not the one cooking, but it does not make a harm asking the chef does it?  She made it seem like I owned her money or something! 

Conclusion: I would not return to this restaurant due to their service and portion; most importantly, I have tasted better at other restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a new Hong Kong style restaurant, to replace the pho trend.

I had a late lunch there after getting a hair cut in the same plaza, the place are 40% full, not bad for a weekday lunch.
I guess they just took over the place not too long ago? Some of the decor are still having writings of \"pho trend\".

The soup was great, much much heartier than I expected. And it had quite a bit of meat in it too.
The baked pork chop w/ rice was really good. The overall balance of the dish was really good.

The milk tea that is included in the meal, didn't came for while. After I asked for it, it still took much longer than it should to arrive. Service was a bit slow, hope they will improve in time."}
{"text":"Holy soccer, Batman! There's probably more soccer crap in here than I have ever seen in my life. I mean, it's not really saying much since I'm not a soccer fan,  but there was still a ton of stuff!

With that said, we were planning on going to another cafe in the plaza, but it was closed, so we ended up headed across the parking lot to Chloe's. My mom had been here once, but it was my first time. Service was really quick, got seated right away, and checked on for orders.

I ended up getting the Hainanese Chicken Rice, as it came highly recommended by my dad and other Yelpers, and it definitely did NOT disappoint! I can dare say, probably one of the best Hainanese Chicken Rice I've had in the area! Rice was beautifully cooked with flavour to accompany the chicken, which was done perfectly. Gave you good bites of meat (unlike some places that just give you all bones), and was complimented by the sauces and radishes that came with. Everything else our table ordered was average, and nothing specifically worth mentioning.

A very interested vibe, as it was a mash-up between sports bar and Hong Kong style cafe, but it seemed to work. Space was large with lots of tables and seat, and servers worked really fast and efficiently. Loved the Hainanese Chicken Rice, so may come back for that, but probably just for that."}
{"text":"Very typical HK cafe in terms of the decor and menu. They seem to have some stone bowl rice which was popular and the chicken rice.

I decided to try the pork chop and fried egg with mustard sauce and spaghetti. It was not bad. The pork chop was fried of course and the egg was nicely cooked. I thought the mustard sauce was not bad it went nicely with the pork chop and spaghetti. It comes w a drink and I ordered my usual HK milk tea. I didn't think it was that good all milk no tea taste. That's kind of a deal breaker for me. How can a HK cafe have bad HK milk tea!!! Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yeah it's cheap but for bad service and bad food. I noticed something was in my drink and told the waitress and she got mad as hell. All I asked was to get another cup to switch it into and for the rest of the meal I was getting her attitude which just ruined everything."}
{"text":"Food is 3 stars but their service ruined my appetite. Their waitresses are super arrogant and rude. *They would expect you to place your order after you sit down for 3mins. *Will give you an attitude when you ask them for a glass of tap water becoz the 4yrs old kid couldn't drink the hot water they provided. *Just drop down the bill and pick up the money. No thank you No goodbye. In short, there are many Hk style cafes to choose from on HWY 7 that offer normal service and good food. I wouldnt be going to this place to ruin my mood again."}
{"text":"Not an HK tea restaurant type person, but everyone wanted to try this location, so we went. 

The decor was pretty good, not like some of the other HK restaurants that I have gone to. There was a lot of space, and it wasn't loud. I could actually hear the person in front of me speak. 

Ordered a couple of things, Beef Brisket noodles, salmon fried rice, pho, Hainan Chicken rice, and shredded pork noodles. 

The food wasn't bad. Not impressed with the two noodles, but the salmon fried rice was pretty good. Everyone else seemed to love the food. 

Service wasn't good, but wasn't bad either. Just like everyone other Chinese place out there where you are ignored unless you call the waiter. 

Pro

Lots of space
Not very loud
Ok portions of food
Very good soup base with the noodles

Con

Noodles didn't taste very good. Thought they were very soft
Hainan Chicken Rice wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with friends after church. Chloe's Garden Restaurant has a spacious and aesthetic interior - a crossover between the looks of a sports bar (soccer to be exact) and a typical Hong Kong style cafe. The service staff accommodated our group size by pushing tables together and were helpful in answering questions. Unfortunately, one problem was that they couldn't split the bill amongst individuals so all our orders were on one large bill, but thankfully we were able to make it work in the end. The food came quickly and it was extremely flavourful. The portions were sufficient to satisfy my hunger. A bit far (I had a ride with friends) so I probably wouldn't visit here again because of the distance and location from my home, but if in the plaza area again, I would give it another shot. My friends enjoyed their meals too. Prices are a bit more expensive than my favourite Hong Kong style cafe (Fortune Stone) but still affordable for a student."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick breakfast. I must admit their breakfast came super fast! The quality, not so much. I ordered the typical noodle in soup with shredded meat. It was alright, nothing to rave about. I kept thinking to myself I need more taste in this bowl of noodles! I kept looking for hot sauce, but its too early for that... My husband meal was better he ordered the toast with butter, fried eggs and spam. The best part was prob the bread with butter.... But that's hard to screw up.

I don't think I would come back here again. The price is decent... Roughly 10$ for two ppl which is pretty cheap, but there are better places out there that is only a few dollars more and it taste so much better! 

Oh their Chinese coffee is pretty good though!"}
{"text":"Spacious lunch spot (was Pho On 7). Pretty full on a Saturday afternoon. They have lunch specials starting at $7.95 and nothing over $10. All came with soup (tomato or cream) and milk-tea or coffee. Service was quick and courteous. Nothing to complain about the food, but price could defiantly be a bit cheaper compared to similar food in the area. See picture for the lunch menu."}
{"text":"There's soccer memorabilia everywhere and big screen TVs to watch the game. Came here at afternoon tea time and there were tables of men loudly cheering on the game. The service is nothing special and neither is the food. Menu seems a bit eclectic for HK cafe fare but the price is alright. Kind of a weird place to have tea/watch soccer. At least it's clean."}
{"text":"I was there last night and I can say it is edible food. Service is alright, I ordered a baked rice casserole and I was expecting it to be... Baked? But was in a rush, so u left it as is. If you are not asking too much, then come over for speedy service."}
{"text":"There's lack of flavor in the food and I felt the menu options were limited. No expectation with service."}
{"text":"One evening, my mum and I had somewhere to be nearby and needed an early dinner. She mentioned there's this Hong Kong style cafe behind Gal's Sushi on Hwy 7, so we decided to try it. 

When we walked in at 5:30pm and requested a table for two. They asked if we had a reservation, I looked around the restaurant and it was empty except for the 3 employees standing by the cash desk. Would it have mattered we had made a reservation or not?

We were each given a 1 page, double-sided menu. But I seriously just wanted wanted a bowl of shrimp dumpling with rice noodle in soup. The menu lacks these simple basic cafe items, but it's definitely different. I ended up ordering a bowl of beef brisket rice noodle soup with some sort of spicy pickled vegetables. Nothing memorable, it was just meh. 

There are a lot of TVs in this place and during my visit, they were airing football/soccer, and football bunting across the place. 

So is this place a sports bar or a Hong Kong style cafe? I'm not too sure."}
{"text":"If you are here, you are really just looking for something basic, cheap and quick for breakfast. Do not expect the food to be phenomenal or anything in general. However,  if you don't have a mobile device to read the news, they do offer free newspaper in the morning. If you don't want fast food for breakfast, come here.

AFTER BREAKFAST: I was debating if I should give 3 stars or 2 stars, because I had to wait 15 mins for the bill and another 10 mins for them to give me the change.... hmmmmmmm they are testing my limit"}
{"text":"This restaurant is an interesting one.  It's definitely geared towards a very specific niche.  People that like \"Cha Chan Tang\" (HK style Cafe) + Football (Soccer) + Beer.

A sports bar that is Football-centric where you can sit down and have a meal.

Food
======
I was with family, we ordered 4 dishes.
- 2 noodle soups
- 1 Curry Pork Chop (breaded and fried)
- 1 Haianese Chicken Rice (see photos)

Noodle soups were a bit on the bland side.  Pork chop was pretty dry.  And Haianese chicken was also pretty dry.  

The texture of the chicken was like cooked chicken that has been in the fridge too long.  It has that dry, stringy texture of days old re-heated chicken.

Drinks
=======
Cold milk tea was watery.  Horlicks was good.


Overall
=======
Probably won't be back unless they have some new menu items or something.  We ordered 4 dishes all of which were not very good so it doesn't exactly inspire us to try their other food."}
{"text":"I remember coming to this place during the summer to watch the World Cup, food was decent. So i decided to drop by and have a nice lunch, which is exactly what I got. Just an average lunch that got me full. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either; hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Nice, clean, spacious
Food: 
1. Pad thai lunch set
- creme soup: adequate, few pieces of corn
- pad thai: 1/5, entirely ketchup based, i couldn't even get through a quarter of the meal, barely any meats or veggies. 

Overall: probably wont be back, nothing memorable."}
{"text":"If you want lower than average HK style cha Chang tang and you can't drive anywhere around the area by all means grab a seat, but if you want to be full and expect quality, don't walk in. Portions were insanely small and taste was bland. The fried chicken wings came with TWO actual wings cut in half to show 4 pieces but the plate was so big it looked like the rest was left in the kitchen. Fries were tasteless and soft. The fried fish cutlet was no too impressive as there was more better than fish. And finally, my Guilin rice noodle had some soft noodles but was nothing special compared to all the newer noodle restaurants in the area. Too bad, their location is great and the place is comfortable but I can't eat a building....or can I?"}
{"text":"The top recommendation from restaurant is HK style thick cut baked pork chop rice in tomato sauce. Portion is very small for $9 and the pork is small but thicker than normal. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Chloe is a HK tea cafe that has relatively contemporary decor.  I had a lunch special stir fried here.  The food tasted okay, the pricing was okay, the services were okay.  The only thing that stood out to me was that the square food plate was quite large, making the portion seemed small.  Once I started eating, the portion was okay.

Choe offers free Wifi.  It accepts credit cards.

This store is conveniently located for me.  I probably will return for lunches and dinners."}
{"text":"Nice interior and spacious. 
Ordered pork neck in cream sauce with spaghetti, fried udon with beef, and seafood fried rice. All meals came with a drink so we got iced milk tea. Overall the food was good. Nothing really special to point out or negative to complain about. Food is affordable at about $9 to $10 a dish from what we ordered. Service was quick as there were hardly any customers."}
{"text":"2.5/5

Maybe I didn't order the right item. The place was very busy for a Monday afternoon, so something had to be good here. However both my dad and I were left unsatisfied with our soup noodles.

I had the seafood laksa and my dad had the beef brisket noodle soup, nicknamed the \"red devil\" noodle soup (hmm...seeing how the place had a lot of England soccer team flags, perhaps it's supposed to resemble Manchester United?). Both our meals didn't come with a drink, so we had to order them separately.

The seafood laksa was, to be fair, not terrible. However considering it was $8.99, I've definitely had better for less. For starters, the soup base tasted way off. I was skeptical when I didn't see a spicy icon next to the seafood laksa, and I can see why after trying it. The red devil noodle soup had a very sour taste, which honestly drove whatever the flavour of the noodles and beef  was away.

The saving grace was that both the milk tea and lemon tea tasted quite good, which made me not completely write this place off yet.

Service could be improved however. I don't think the waitress said a word to us at all, only pointed to our table, walked to us, wrote our orders, gave our food, gave our bill, and our change.

The free wifi wasn't working this afternoon. Tsk."}
{"text":"Clean place.  Has big screen TV and  alcohol license.  Service Ok.  Menu selection good.  Portions a bit small.  Had the crepe cake dessert at dinner time and it was dry."}
{"text":"Pros:
Large seating area
Specials for any time of the day

Cons:
Not as much variety as other HK style cafes
Portions could be bigger

Seen this place many times as I have a friend who lives in the condos near by.  Finally decided to give it a try for lunch.  

When we first walked in I thought the place was a decent size. Little did I know that I was only seeing half the place.  They had a whole other seating section on the other side I missed at first.  Needless to say there is a bunch of seating here.  There is also a huge soccer motif going on here.  The placed is lined with soccer decorations and the TVs have soccer playing as well.  If you love soccer, this is your kinda place.

This place has menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They have specials for every part of the day.  Having said that, I found the menus a little limited compared to other HK style cafes.  They have say 20-25 items per menu so you're really limited to what they offer at that time of day.  I don't know if you can ask for other menus for different times but we were only given the menu for the time of day we came.  There wasn't a regular menu that we could order from at any time of the day.  We came at 1030 and were given the breakfast menu.  I had to wait until after 1100 to grab a lunch menu and order from there.

The food was very well done in my opinion here.  The presentation was nice, even for the bowl of noodles which was nice considering no one really takes the time to make a bowl of noodles look that good.  My rice dish looked better than most places. Taste-wise everything is on par as far as HK cafes go.

All in all, a fairly decent HK style cafe.  I think the soccer motif is a different take on things as well.  They are pretty decent where it counts though, the food."}
{"text":"Other Yelpers commented about slow service but I thought it was okay.   The server was responsive and got all I asked for.  

I had Hai-Nan Chicken with Rice and it somehow \"missed\" to my liking.   Something about the chicken was off but I might be just me.   The food did not seem appetizing.   The couple in the next table seemed not to recognizing their orders when they got them.  

This restaurant's food is definitely not for me despite the attractive menus."}
{"text":"This is a Hong Kong style cafe, sports bar hybrid like Cafe Hollywood. The restaurant is very spacious inside and looks contemporary.
Menu items are limited but most are very creative and inviting.
I ordered a Portuguese sauce pork cheek and rice gratin, overall sauce and pork cheeks were tasty and concept is unique. However, portions run very small compared to similar competitors. For a baked rice, you're looking at ~$10-13, which is slightly more expensive than other HK cafes, not unacceptable. But given that I would finish the entire dish and feel unsatisfied, I don't really wanna come back. Usually, for the same price or less, other places give me enough that I can pack the leftovers for another full meal.
I also found the sauce to rice ratio horrible. Rice was too drenched in sauce so tasted too salty and wet."}
{"text":"They have wifi - it's their phone number. 

I really like this place. Particularly the \"House Special\" baked pork chop in tomato sauce with cheese. I like the sauce, which is plentiful and mixes well with the rice. The portion size is large. It also comes with soup and drink as one would usually expect from these places. I think I'll be coming here often because of it's convenient location and because I crave milk tea sometimes. :)"}
{"text":"This is probably one of those places i would never return. Ordered thick-cut pork chop rice and curry krispy pork spaghetti with two iced lemon tea. Pork chop was not juicy and they were seasoned badly, not thick at all. I say half the thickness from their pictures on menu, small portion; rice was poorly fried with egg. The only thing we like was the sauce. 

The curry krispy pork was ok as the meat was thin and tender, the amount of krispy coating was just right. Curry sauce was too watery and we weren't able to get extra sauce because the waitress said to me it will cost more and she just walked away. 

There are plenty of hk style restaurant with way better food quality and good value than this place in the area. 

The drinks came about 85% full so we thought they give you room to add the syrup/sugar. I asked for syrup and the waitress told me it's sweetened and all blended in already.

$30 for two people NAY..........."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was confusing; Sports bar with hong Kong  cafe style food.  Good was good but expect the device to be a bit slow and disorganized."}
{"text":"Newer cha chang teng or afternoon tea place.
The food here js mediocre with 2 exceptions: the hoi lam chicken rice and the pork with bolognese sauce.

If there is a football game on, with the amount of televisions in the resturant, it is a good place to watch it.

But otherwise everything here is meh."}
{"text":"The servers here are extremely terrible. They gave the customers hard feeling and bad attitude for my past experience. Foods are just fair but nothing special. Unforgettable awful service implanted in my mind. I won't give it a chance and will tell all of my friends about my experience."}
{"text":"I haven't seen the speedy service of restaurants in Toronto in a long while. The speed of the food coming out of the kitchen is faster than fast-food restaurants. It also gives a little bit of a pub feeling. 

We tried the German BBQ Pork with bread and sour vegetables on the side for $13.99 on Tuesdays. The skin is crispy and the meat is full of flavour. It is slightly oily but tolerable. 

Yes I think I will come back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Food is not up to standard. Service was horrible. Last time I visit with my daughter and waitress were swearing out loud with the kitchen staff. Not appropriate at all."}
{"text":"Small portions and food takes too long. I ordered the fish and salad. It came once my boyfriend was finished his meal and was breaded which was not in the description. This place is incomparable to other HK tea places in markham. Prices are high for the tiny portions and flavours are just average. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Another 'Hong Kong Style' restaurant that gives you great value for your money
with an array of authentic chinese style dishes on the menu.
We tried their Salmon fried rice and it was very good. Not too spicy, and there was a generous portion of salmon in the rice. The prices are very good here, but they could improve the service a little. If you are in the area and want to stop for a quick snack, try this place instead of a fast food joint. 'Cheap and Cheerful'. I could not give this place 4 stars though because it lacks the 'wow factor'..."}
{"text":"Chloe's Garden is a very average HK-style cafe.  It has all the staples from Hainese Chicken Rice to just fish balls with noodles.  
I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my mom and some of her friends for lunch. 

Service was prompt - they took our orders and then served us.

I got the Hainese Chicken Guilin Noodles ... which took the longest to come out (I swear they forgot until they realized I was the only person without a meal in front of them).
The chicken was decent and the bowl was big enough to fill me ... but the soup base did lack in flavour.

The mustard chicken my brother got was okie dokes ... the flavour wasn't bad and there was a big enough portion to fill him.

My mom's baked (tomato? saucy) chicken rice was actually not too bad and she didn't finish it so we got it to go.

The HK milk tea is average as well .. nothing to write home about but definitely has the HK taste.

Overall, very average.  I'll definitely come back if I don't feel like waiting at Phoenix or Sun-Sing on Kennedy and Highway 7."}
{"text":"I came with my mom on a Sunday afternoon and we we're quickly greeted by the waitress who sat us.

The daily soup and our drinks came pretty much right after we ordered - quick and efficient! We had the borsht and cream of corn soup. They were both quite good and the borsht soup had a lot of chopped vegetables and minced beef.

As main we ordered tomato baked pork chop with rice and Malaysian beef brisket curry on rice.

Tomato baked pork chop:
The pork chop was cooked to perfection, and the tomato base sauce had a nice tang to my liking. I love the melted cheese on top with a bit of a nice char! Also a great thing was that the default rice that comes with the pork chop is egg fried rice. Which is usually an added request.

Malaysian beef brisket curry on rice:
The beef brisket was very tender, but my mom find that the sauce was a bit sweet. Even though the sweetness was fine with me, just the spice wasn't working for me.

Overall, I will definitely come back. It's rare to have friendly and efficient service at a HK cafe, especially with delicious food!"}
{"text":"Walked in as mom heard from one of her friends there's a HK cafe beside the Hilton. Parking was limited (there's underground), all free.  Mom noticed multiple signs with a lobster with steak set dinner special for $19.99. We were very excited to get that to share + also try out the baked tomato pork rice!

Upon sitting we ordered, but only to a disappointment the waitress informed us that dinner special was for Christmas Day only.  Ok, come'on it's mid January! Urgggh so disappointed.  Instead, we continued ordering the baked tomato pork rice and mix meat grilled on sizzling plate.  We didn't want another plate of rice or pasta so we asked for veggies/fries on the side. Guess what? An extra $1! For maybe 8-10 strips of McCann home fries *sigh*.  The mix grill wasn't a wow, the steak well, more like beef cold cut. There were no fried egg, but chicken, hot dog, bacon, and pork were here to represent.  For over $12 bucks I wouldn't get it ever again.  It lacks quality or quantity.  The baked tomato pork rice, however, wasn't too bad. The sauce is just right and the pork was still juicy and tender.

Highlight of the visit: 

no lines. Half empty. Super hungry so that worked out :)

{"text":"Cleaner, quieter, and more spacious than New City. Prices are about 21.50 for 2 people at lunch time ordering a meal and warm drinks.  

There's steady wi-fi and not just some lie about free wi-fi (which  many HK-style cafes use as a gimmick to lure you inside). 

We've tried their Hainan chicken 3 times, the breakfast menu, and 2 styles of pork chop with rice/spaghetti (Montreal and tomato sauce).

Owners must love football (soccer), there's sports on at all times on their tv (but volume is quiet which is a-ok)."}
{"text":"When I opened the door and walked inside Chole's Garden Restaurant, I came face to face with a Toronto Maple Leaf's jersey!

The music here is hip and loud. The TVs are tuned to Hockey Night in Canada.

Am I in a sport bar? But what's that smell of Pho in the air?

This is really a new Hong Kong Style Cafe that opened up that replaced Pho Trend.

$9.99 or so will get you a set dinner with soup, main, dessert and drink. In line with most of the HK cafe in the area.

House Special Baked Pork Chop with Rice ($9.99) used lean pork and was quite tender. The only problem was the kitchen baked it at high heat and burnt some of the pieces! Taste of bitterness!

I don't mind coming back for lunch or afternoon tea if I am in the area to chill as the interior is spacious and has free wifi.

Btw, they serves beer..maybe Chole's Garden Restaurant can be a Sport Bar after all!"}
{"text":"My mood was ruined as soon as we got here. Staff were very rude. Dont bother asking any questions about the menu, which is all in Chinese btw."}
{"text":"Last night, we were there at 8PM and there were still plenty of seats. 
My friend and I ordered two dishes, one was the pork neck in Portuguese sauce with rice, and the other was baked sole fillet in spinach cream sauce with rice. Now with those dishes, you can only pick soup OR drink, not like before, I remember we had both.
Also the server had a bit of an attitude. Not rude, but she could have been nicer. 
When our dishes came, there was a lot of sauce. It was good for my friend whom liked a lot of sauce. But the downside was that there wasn't as much meat. The pork neck meat was thick cut, but the quantity wasn't a lot 

We'd usually come here for a quick dinner, so it's decent serving speed but don't expect too much from the food here."}
{"text":"The food is horrible, stay away, ordered teriyaki chicken, came never saw anything like it till I tasted it, taste like old fish, my friend ordered curie beef, no beef present 2 small pcs,  sent it back and left the restaurant without paying, do NOT even try this place. garbage goes not do it Justice."}
{"text":"A good place to go if you want a quick bite to eat. Chloe's Garden specializes in HK style dishes and tastes pretty good. Their service is relatively fast and prices are fair. Improvements could be made if the tables are cleaned more thoroughly."}
{"text":"Typical informal, prompt service. This is supposed to be a HK style cafe yet they have a TV turned to the sports channel and sports-themed apparel decorating the entire place. The ventilation is terrible and makes your clothes stink after.

Food was nothing great. I ordered the bolognese spaghetti which came with a mediocre cream soup. Props to them for putting enough cheese in the sauce. Overall, I would say it was on par with every other bolognese spaghetti I've had. The pho was a generous portion and came steaming hot. Not bad for a place that doesn't specialize in Viet food. 

I've had mixed opinions about the food from people I know. Just stick with \"safe\" foods and you should be fine."}
{"text":"I came here the first time. Service was good. Prompt. I just wasn't a fan of the food. I asked the waitress what's the best and most popular chicken dish. She suggested grilled chicken with spinach and cheese with rice. It came out very hot, which was great. It was an \"ok\" rating. One big piece was only the skin of chicken with no actual meet in there. I will probably not eat here again. Maybe it's just not my taste."}
