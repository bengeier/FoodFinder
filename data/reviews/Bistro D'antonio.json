{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Super friendly staff and great service. Had a lovely dinner. I tried the eggplant park and they gave me the option of broccoli instead of pasta, which helped me to lighten up my meal so I could have some more yummy bread, hehe. The Napoleon was super delicious too! The cream filling was amazing."}
{"text":"We went to Bistro D'Antonio for a birthday dinner.  Wow, it was wonderful, much to choose from on the menu and I was particularly amazed at the different salad choices they had.  We had a Meatballs Al Forno for an appetizer, and they were great, soft and very flavorful.  There were six of us and everyone enjoyed their dinner very much from Lasagna to Linguine Clam Sauce Pasta and more, no one was disappointed.  The wait staff were very helpful and always at hand for a request.   We will be returning soon and often!"}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to love this place after hearing so many reviews. Unfortunately I did not. The best part, the calamari, was excellent! Caesar dressing tasted like cheap bottled dressing and the shrimp scampi was...terrible. Zero flavor. There were chunks of garlic in the sauce and they didn't even taste like garlic. Instead of using traditional angel hair pasta, a thin spaghetti was used which was too thick for the watery sauce in the bottom of the dish. Shrimp was good sized and they didn't skimp, but had no flavor. Overall the dish tasted like plain shrimp and pasta in tomato water. Three of us had this dish and we all agreed that it was awful. $20 dish to boot.   Our waiter was super sweet and the mint Swiss chocolate martini is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of 31 people and the food & service were outstanding. Everyone's food came out on time and drinks were filled promptly. Like many others in our group, we'll be regulars here."}
{"text":"Went back again last night and ordered a martini with olives and it was great, with a thin layer of ice on top.  Shaken!!  Just as we were getting ready to order, a big storm came through and the lights went out.  They called the power company and were told it would be at least 2 hours.  We decided we were too hungry to wait, but we got the martinis on the house!!  We ended up somewhere else down the road, but made reservations for a group of us to go back in  a couple of weeks.  We also asked that Angel be our server!  He's the best.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the bruscetia and it was spot on! The wine selection is a good on but a little over priced per bottle. Had the surf and turf special tonight, and the steak was flawless! The lobster tail needs some work though. Tried other entrees tonight as well. The Maui over Risotta was another special and the Maui was a little dry, but the shrimp and Risotta was fantastic. By far the Eggplant parmesan was the best I have had in Union County!  If you like sauce ask for extra marinara! It has an old school Italian taste to it! Wasn't as much on my pasta as I like at first but they provided as much when I asked. Overall, it was a great evening out without kids, next time the kids come and they get the full test. Great start to a new restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice and both times it was delicious. I've had the bruschetta, caprese salad and both times I got the chicken Antonio's way. The food taste fresh and it's seasoned perfectly. The service was spectacular. They are very nice and attentive. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We tried Bistro D'antonio via a recommendation from a friend.  We are new to the area; 6 months.  I ordered the veal marsala and my husband ordered the veal parmesan.  For the price, I thought the veal should have been thinner and more tender.  It was a bit thick.  I didn't like the marsala sauce; a bit bitter and I thought the veal smelled close to being spoiled.  I have a keen sense of smell.  The lobster bisque was very good; however, I think $8 is pricey.  My hubby thought the veal was a bit thick as well.  Overall, I don't think we would try it again for dinner.  We don't mind paying a higher price, but we expect better food for the price.  Perhaps brunch would be better.  The food in SC just isn't as good as back home. The best part of the meal was the fact that we had a coupon. The ambiance was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I order the chicken parm to-go just about every weekend. It is absolutely delicious! I'm not sure about the other food, because that's all we get. Well, my husband likes their spaghetti with meat sauce also, however, I've never tried it. Their bread is awesome though! 4 stars instead of 5 because it is a bit pricey, but not when things frequently go wrong. Like just this past weekend, the hostess \"forgot\" to put our order in. So when my husband showed up 30 minutes later, she told him she forgot and put it in then. So then he had to wait another 30 minutes. We weren't offered a coupon, discount for that meal, or a managers apology. I also order extra mozzarella on my chicken parm all the time and it's a 50\50 chance if I get it or not. Issues aside, the food is delicious and we will continue to order our usual chicken parms!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful dinner.  All ingredients were super fresh.  Every entree was great - this is one of the best Italian places we've discovered near Waxhaw (outside of northern NJ)!"}
{"text":"After seeing all these great reviews wife and I decided to drive down and see.  First, hostess seemed uninterested in our seating preference. Sitting someone where the sun is shining when there are so many empty tables is unacceptable.oh,I forgot to mention there were only two other couples in the restaurant.  Then we waited nearly 10 minutes before our waiter showed up.he didn't bother to explain the daily special and when we ordered he rolled his eyes as if to show his disgust at our splitting a meal..  Our pasta was barely warm and the veal was also.  Waiter never came back to check to see if we needed anything. If the place was crowded I could understand wait staff scurrying about but like I said before there were only 2 other couples there.and several waiters but no one seemed interested in serving us. We almost got up to leave after sitting for almost 10 minutes but decided to stay. Unfortunately it was a bad experience.probably not going back- more than one Italian restaurant in area so unless things change here they won't be one of them. Sorry, but we were really disappointed."}
{"text":"Adequate food & overpriced, the pasta is very bland with very little flavor. Not sure if they make their pasta on site... It seemed fresh enough, but just needed more flavor. I'll say that at least it wasn't mushy!  We went on a Saturday around 6 PM and were lucky to get a table because apparently every table in the joint is reserved in advance, so call ahead!  Compared to our favorite, oggi, just a few extra minutes away... The pricing is about the same but nowhere near the same quality of food. We have a runner in the family and it's fine for a carb - load meal... But it was expensive. For four of us with desserts and only one glass of wine it was almost $160 for plain pasta dishes (nothing extra special or extravagant, only one meal w/added shrimp and one w/chicken, 2 others plain fettuccini dishes)."}
{"text":"We gave the Bistro another try last night and this time we had a truly wonderful experience! We noticed right away that the menu was different than last time we were here, and sure enough, Marcelino confirmed that they changed it and expect to make a few more tweaks to it in the near future.  That is great, see what works, and what doesn't and move forward accordingly!   Speaking of Marcelino, he took excellent care of us - he is a true professional! We were impressed with his service on our first visit, and even more so on our second visit. Definitely 5 star service!   Ok, so on to the rest. Since this was not a special occasion, we weren't going for a high end wine.  We ordered an Italian red - Anterra Merlot. For $25, this was a good dinner wine...very drinkable & it paired nicely with our food.   We decided to give the Calamari ($10) another try and I am so glad we did. This time it was much more flavorful. We noticed that it looked like there was more spices in the light breading and they had also breaded and fried a couple of peppers with the calamari... we didn't remember seeing that the first time. Again, I like the fact that they serve their Calamari with both a marinara sauce for me and an aioli sauce for my hubby.  We were very pleased with this appetizer.   Tonight we decided to try the stuffed mushrooms ($10) as well.  Wow, they were good! Stuffed with spinach & cheese and topped with melted mozzarella... yum! I was not a big fan of the mayo-based aioli style spread underneath the mushrooms, but that was easy enough to avoid.  I would probably order these again.   We both ordered the Ceaser salad ($8 each). Honestly, with the 2 appetizers, we should have ordered one salad and split it, because by now, I am already starting to feel full, oops! Or, it would be nice if they would offer the option of 1/2 salad... that way, hubby could get the full size Ceaser salad  & I could do a half salad.  So about the salad... the lettuce was fresh, croutons big & crunchy, and there was a nice amount of shaved parmesan.  Our only disappointment in the salad is that it was really lightly dressed...as in you could barely taste any dressing. I am not a fan of the places that douse your salad in tons of dressing, but this was too light. I suppose we could have asked for a bit more dressing, but honestly, we didn't think of it at the time.  Maybe next time I will order dressing on the side, that way I can put as much as I'd like without it being too much.    For my entr√©e, I was torn between the Cannelloni Florentina ($17) and the Eggplant Parm. I knew I wanted something with a red sauce, and either a chicken or vegetarian dish.  (I typically love seafood, but was not in the mood for pesce...and I don't eat beef or pork, so none of those offerings appeal to me.)  I ended up going with the Cannelloni Florentina, crepes stuffed with ricotta, spinach, mozzarella, and topped with red sauce.  It was very flavorful and filling. With the 2 appetizers and salad, I definitely had enough leftover for lunch the next day.   My hubby chose linguini with clams & white sauce ($18) for his entr√©e.  I took a bite and it was pretty good. The portion size was good for him and they did not skimp on the clams.   So, this time we did not save room for dessert since we started with 2 appetizers.   Based on this experience, we will definitely be going back. Looking forward to seeing what else they do with tweaking the future menus!  Speaking of tweaking the menu, personally, I'd like to see more options for people who don't eat pork/red meat... for example, both the bruschetta and aranchini appetizers have some sort of pork product incorporated in it, so its not something I would order.  In the pasta/entr√©e sections it would also be nice to see some other options such as ravioli or tortellini offerings with a choice of cream sauce or red sauce and the ability to  add a meat or seafood of choice (like chicken or shrimp)."}
{"text":"Amazing food and by far the best service we have ever gotten at a restaurant. Ever. Husband and I split an appetizer, the lobster bisque (which was to die for), and the two lobster over spaghetti pomodoro special, with an added side of mushroom garlic risotto. Everything was so tasty and big enough portions to split. It was a delicious date night."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our meal here. We had the stuffed mushrooms appetizer which was good -- four mushrooms. I ordered the shrimp scampi entree and I suggest selecting the vegetable of the day over the pasta and asking for a little more bread -- which was delicious soaked in that wine sauce. My husband ordered the chicken Antonio's Way and he said it was tasty as well."}
{"text":"In my earlier experience here I was OK with it, but did not like the menu and missed the previous operation and manager.  But we have since been back three times, once with our son's family of five and twice just with wife and me.  We are now true fans and think it a go-to restaurant in our area.  Open every day of the week it is great to not have to go on Fridays or Saturdays when most working people and their families can get out.  Being retired gives us the luxury of dining out on Sundays through Thursdays.  And although still  popular and busy every night, reservations are only mandatory on Fridays and Saturdays.     I will say that everything is good and the bar excellent.  Service and servers are super.  Hostesses and manager circulate to check on you.  You are in good hands.  The Osso bucco is outstanding.  It is veal, not lamb.  They cook it on the bone but instead of picking the meat off of the bone they have pushed down the meat to the end of the bone, giving you a dense, juicy, beautifully done hunk o'meat to slice into and eat.  Very yummy and even though I am not a fan of risotto, the rice dish with the osso bucco is very good.  Wife adores, yes, adores the eggplant Parmesan.  And I have to agree, but with a more masculine adjective.  It is flavorful, not veggie-tasting, is loaded with cheese and a delicious tomato sauce.  Super good and I think that is all she will order when we eat here.    They have cioppino, a fish broth stew/soup.  In my experience this is more thin broth with some pieces of seafood.  But at Bistro D'Antonio it is a generous pile of shellfish, fish and linguine with a thin tasty marinara poured over it.  A substantial dish that I have only finished once.  The other times I regretfully had to leave some of it in the bowl.  Sad, sad waste of wonderful tastes.  Drinks are well done at their full bar and there is a pretty good wine list that has a number of nice wines available by the glass.  Bread is served fresh from the oven.  GREAT with the cioppino if you are smart enough to order that dish.  You will want to hug me for that suggestion.  Very happy with the new Bistro that replaces Trattoria Antigua. An excellent replacement."}
{"text":"Was there recently for a quickie dinner... and to take advantage of their Tues. 1/2 price wine nite.  The Italian Chopped Salad was fantastic.... and since it was late... was plenty to eat along with their house made  bread.  Heard the lunch menu with a terrific Cuban and a real Philly Cheese Steak is also terrific.  Going to try that soon as well.  It's always aa treat to go to a place to eat and see the owners, (Antonio and Charlene) out on the floor making sure everyone gets taken care of ... a rarity today IMHO... so it makes for a nice experience."}
{"text":"The service here is excellent! We were watching as Antonio visited every single table. He was such a gracious host. The food is very good, but not 5-star. It's a dressed-up version of what you might find at a really good pizza place, but with a $$$ pricetag. I did appreciate,  however,  the very thin cut chicken piccata. It was delicious. The accompanying pasta was tossed in some olive oil and garlic and was just so-so. Maybe if the garlic was roasted a little longer, the flavors might have come through a little more. Our guest ordered the carbonara. It was really, really good. The desserts were very good too. I wish there were a way to give this place 4 1/2 stars, because it deserves more than 4. But 5 stars would be be perfection and I have eaten at Italian restaurants at these prices, that have more authentic Italian selections/flavors on their menu. Be prepared to spend $100+ for two people. This restaurant should really be listed as $$-$$$. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!! We loved their original restaurant and were so glad to see they opened another. This is a go to place for great Italian food."}
{"text":"Always a good time with Antonio! The food was wonderful and most importantly, they care about their customers. Do not miss out on the Risotto and Mozzarella balls! Can't wait to get back there."}
{"text":"We went here last night for the first time, and we had great food. We had an appetizer of steak flatbread. Our entrees were the rigatoni with italian sausage and a pork chop special. Both were wonderful. There's no need to drive to Charlotte, we've got great italian here in Waxhaw. My only minor gripe is I wish their signage was a little more attention grabbing. I think it is easy to pass by and not notice it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with quality food and excellent service! Having moved from NY, it's been tough to find a quality restaurant like this. A real hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Dinner here last night every thing was great Derick the bartender was excellent as was Ruby our waitress  Lobster tails and lamb chops were Great Salted caramel gelato for desert was great And our cocktails and wine were very very good These people know how to run a restaurant  The owner was watching everything and making sure all of the guest were happy This is a gem of a restaurant  We will go back often"}
{"text":"We Love this place!!  We go as often as we can. Never have been disappointed either!!!  Everything on the menu is delicious. We enjoy the ambiance and the service is stellar with the exception of one time. We have been here at least 10 times and had a large group once for Brunch!  By the way their brunch is awesome!!!! On March 31 we had dinner there. It was a Saturday nite. Appetizers and entrees were perfect. Our waiter was strange in many ways though. I tried not to be upset so I just quietly kept telling him how awful he was when he was was out of hearing range. Lol. I bet he doesn't work there any more. When to go check this place....You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Wow disappointing! So much potential...just falls short. 2 adults and a child $117 Went for dinner. Tons of service people buzzing around. Older crowd. Nice decor. Very loud. Nice looking full bar and well set tables. That is the end of the good. Ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer, veal Marsala, shrimp and lobster penne, and kids Alfredo rigatoni. Goat cheese app: extremely bland and boring Veal Marsala: Gross and side pasta grease is still coating my mouth 2 hours later Shrimp and Lobster pasta: slimy and fishy Kids Rigatoni: overcooked pasta slopping around in half and half. Ordered a Vodka martini that was great and an Old fashioned which was horrendous (same bartender). Despite all the service people (and there were a ton) the service was really lax and unattentive. The customers were kind of lost in the busy work of the staff. This was our first and last visit here. The above meal cost us $117. For a few dollars more we could eat at a prime steak house. Huge local disappointment. Bottom line...sub par Macaroni Grill with a giant bill at the end."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Charlotte for sure! The friendly, welcoming staff and the delicious food makes for a spectacular dinner. Started with the arancini, mussels and calamari - AMAZING. Then had the pesto gnocchi for dinner. All around an amazing meal. Definitely the go to for fresh, reasonably priced italian."}
{"text":"This rating is all about the food.  Went to Bistro D'Antonio for the first time last weekend.  Very busy so sat at the bar.  I'd give Derek the bartender 5 stars for his friendliness, professionalism and recommendations.  He made the night and cared about our experience!  The food.  Started off with calamari and it was ok with the portion being quite small for $10 (two legs and about 8 rings).  Saw another patron at the bar get the same order and they had a lot more calamari on their plate.  Let's be consistent.  Loved the aioli it came with.  Hubby ordered ossobuco and that was delish with a nice risotto.  I ordered the fileto  bianco and it was cooked just right.  The problem?  I was shocked at how small it was and should have said something!  I butcher my own tenderloin filets and it was NOT 8oz.  It was the smallest filet I've ever eaten and probably was 4 oz at most (actually looked it up in the menu when I got home to see how big it was suppose to be!).  And I'm not hallucinating...asked hubby how big he thought it was and he said \"no more than 4oz\".  The cognac cream sauce was great along with the green beans and polenta but the main attraction was lacking and had a big tendon in the bottom I had to cut out.  That should have been trimmed out prior to cooking.  Had a couple nice cappuccinos, hubby got the cannoli  and I tried the tiramisu.  I'd give the tiramisu a 3.5.  Needed more marscapone filling and less coffee soaked lady fingers.  Frankly the picture posted from another patron looked better than the one I had.  It was very nice to, meet Antonio who clearly is very engaged and hard-working as the owner!  We WANT people like him to succeed.  The management and staff is buzzing and busy.  They clearly care about the experience there.  The restaurant is welcoming and attractive.  Let's just fix the food the coming out of the kitchen.  It's not an inexpensive experience.  Two people with two drinks each, one app, two entree's, two cappuccino's and two desserts was about $140.  We'll give it one more chance because we really enjoyed chatting with Derek and know the place has potential."}
{"text":"Go here if you like fruit flies and under cooked lamb......3 terrible experiences!"}
{"text":"Decent for a close Italian option. I got the lobster bisque and shrimp scampi. My husband got the fettuccini carbonara. The bisque wasn't my favorite and the fettuccini was better than the scampi."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! The food, the atmosphere, the service. They've got it all.  This is authentic italian, fresh & flavorful! Me & my hubby frequent here 3 - 4 times a month & I have never had a bad experience.   From the time you walk through the door you're treated like royalty. They just go above & beyond to dote over you & let you know they're happy you're there. Almost like family but better! I love it.  If you visit during the week they have shareable specials, that are really reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Just Great! That staff and service were just terrific... After spending years trying to find an Italian experience that compares to the northeast, we found it...  The food was spectacular and fresh! Try the Mussels and the Veal and I promise you will come back for more...  A great spot, that is our new go to when craving a family type atmosphere with great food at a great price! Make sure you have Derrick the bartender mix you up a Pineapple Martini to get things started..."}
{"text":"Super! Their spegegeti taste so real! Meat balls taste fresh! And their desserts, OMG BOMB! Better then olive garden."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Will definitely be back!  Food is awesome!  Service is incredible!  Atmosphere fun and inviting!  I can't say enough about this place.  I was with a group, so everyone got different dishes and everything was presented beautifully and the taste was exceptional.  Best kept secret--as I never even knew this place was here!!!  Wonderful italian desserts too... if you have room! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't get the hype. We are used to NY italian food and prices, so price isn't the only issue. We tried this place two times and both times we thought it was awful. Many of our friends rave about it but the food was not good and the portions were also small. Maybe three times is a charm?!"}
{"text":"We were not fans of the previous restaurant in this space, and only recently learned that it was under new ownership, so we had to try it!       We read that they would be serving lunch starting October 2nd, so we decided to try it  today when we were in Waxhaw.  We had \"dinner\" for lunch and it was excellent!  My husband had chicken piccatta with asparagus (instead of pasta) - very light and flavorful!  I had the combination of chicken and eggplant Parmesan with sauteed spinach (instead of pasta) and it was great!  We saw another couple with a dessert that was HUGE and looked so good so we asked our waiter about it and ordered the Napoleon - Oh My Goodness!  Just perfect for us.  Such light pastry and delicate cream filling - not overly sweet, but delicious.     Antonio was very personable and helpful.  He told us that dinner before 5:30 was 15% off.  We don't often like going out at night, and prefer lunch, but we will have to try that early time!     Antonio also told us about a special once a month fixed price dinner with wine pairings, $50 a person. This month is completely filled! The next one will be in January though because of Thanksgiving and Christmas.  There are so many other items on the menu we would like to try, so we look forward to going back many times!"}
{"text":"This is our new go-to place for Italian. This makes me so happy because I really wanted to like the previous restaurant that was in this spot, but we really weren't fans. We love supporting local business and to not have to drive out of Waxhaw is an added bonus.    We have tried several items on the menu, but we have our favorites. I am in love with their Eggplant Parm, my husband's go-to is the Rigatoni with Sausage, and we both love the Arancini appetizer. The chicken parm is also delicious. I have to give a special shout-out for the side pasta that comes with the eggplant and chicken parm dishes. Typically, the side pasta is just a toss-away item for me. I eat a few bites of it because it comes with it, but I don't really give it much thought. That is NOT the case here. I don't know what type of magic they sprinkle in it, but it is absolutely delicious!  The service is always very friendly and the menu has something for everyone. The decor is very nice and they have a full bar, too.    The only reasons why I can't give them 5 stars is because the layout of the entrance is a bit odd so a couple of times were have stood there waiting for someone to notice us and it was a bit awkward. We also find the service to be pretty slow most of the time. Super friendly, but nonetheless....slow."}
{"text":"Just found this little gem recently and wow - it's good! It's definitely easy to get into (I encourage reservations). Any of the seafood dishes are worthwhile - if you have room for dessert, you should definitely try the Cannolis. This isn't the most kid friendly of places (not that the staff aren't kid friendly, but the dishes are not made for kiddos). Try the sangria too - it's a homemade concoction and it's pretty tasty."}
{"text":"It is a nice restaurant in my neighborhood. I like the ambiance and staffs. We ordered calamari and mussles for appetizers. Calamari was crunch and mussles were great. White sauce in mussles was well balanced. The appetizers portion is not much, just a right amount for appetizers. For mains dishes, we ordered associated seafood pasta(you can choose pasta you like) as daily special, chicken parmesan(comes with pasta), shrimp scampi and veal francese.   The best was daily special seafood pasta. We asked to make it a bit spicy and it was really good. A great amount of seafood in the pasta and also the seafood was very fresh. The chicken parmesan was pretty good too. Sauce was tasty and breaded chicken was well cooked. But veal francese was a bit chewy. Even though it was thin, certain part was not tender at all. The francese sauce was kinda plain to me but gnocchi was good. Shrimp scampi was just okay. Sauce could have more taste, was not impressive.   For desserts, ordered tiramisu and tres leches cake. Tiramisu cream was a bit plain to me but friend in my group enjoyed it as it is not too sweet. I liked the tres leches a lot. It was moist enough and not too sweet. Overall the food was good and service was great! But the price is not that cheap for fish or meat main dishes. Price of pasta is okay.   It is a good local restaurant and maybe will try their prefixed menu next time."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. The mojito is awesome. Favorite items were the Antonio Salad, chicken marsala and the Tiramisu.  Love the feel of this restaurant, family friendly and beautiful."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant we've been to in south Charlotte area!  The atmosphere, food, wine and service are all on point.   Try it you won't be disappointed but if you go on the weekend be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Yummy drinks. Great service. Love that the owner is present and involved. Will definitely be back!"}
