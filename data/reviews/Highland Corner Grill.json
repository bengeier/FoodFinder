{"text":"Great big pizzas, awesome cheese curds, and I love that you get two sides with some dishes. nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed two meals here and both were very good. Service is very attentive, in part due to low attendance. Most likely, locals don't consider dining at a restaurant associated with a hotel. And, they'd be satisfied if they gave it a try. I especially like the lunch and supper menu selections; nothing exotic but all the regular dishes VERY WELL PREPARED."}
{"text":"Great food, especially for a hotel restaurant. Very good service and atmosphere. Quiet space and attentive waiter. We had the cheeseburger and fries and steak and veggies/salad bar. The cheese burger was really good! The steak was cooked well."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled shrimp tacos, appetizers, and the Badger Burger is awesome. 3rd time here and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"This review is more for the bar than the restaurant.  I will say that the bar tender is very friendly.  He was patient and actually worked a deal for me.  I sat there because there is free wifi and it was in the lobby of the hotel.  The beer is reasonably priced, but sadly the draft beer isn't cold enough....I'm not sure why, but it felt like it wasn't the right temp and had a weird taste to it....Spotted cow  I tried a half order of the nachos....which wasn't on the menu, but the bartender made it happen.  The nachos were good, they added jalape√±os.  I didn't understand why they put lettuce on the nachos....but overall they were decent.  I also tried the Badger Burger....it was dry, overcooked, and tasteless.  The fries that came with it were actually decent, but I didn't even want to finish the burger it was so bland.    Overall, I would not rec'd this place unless you really need wifi and don't have cash...If you are looking for a good bar, go down the street to the Blue Moon Bar."}
{"text":"This place is decent for a hotel resto-lounge. I mean its open late and has OK food so I can't really complain.  Had BBQ wings and quesadillas. The wings were SLATHERED in sauce. I realize that wings come in sauce yes, but I literally had to dip my fingers in a bowl of sauce and fish around for a wing. JK, but not really. No wonder they offer them naked with sauce on the side because my God that was a lot of BBQ sauce. I would definitely recommend sauce on the side.  Quesadillas were standard. Service was standard. They give you huge glasses of pop/water though so I'll take that and quit complaining.   The best part about this place however, is the beautiful patio. Its so nice on a warm night to just sit there are chill out. I definitely enjoyed that part of the evening."}
{"text":"this is definitely an okay hotel restaurant. i came here after a long flight from LA . and i ordered a apple and walnut salad with grill chicken.   the speed for them to get the food on the table is a bit slow maybe because i am super hungry.  the salad is very good: large portion, fresh veggie, crunchy walnut, and sweet apple create a lot of tasted in the mouth and plus the savory grill chicken. the taste is complete!!!   i defiantly think it's a good choice as it's a hotel lounge"}
