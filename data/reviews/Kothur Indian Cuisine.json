{"text":"I think Kothur is the definition of \"Meh\". There were just too many annoyances that kept me from enjoying take-out I just grabbed from Kothur on Yonge.

On the front of the menu it says \"10% off dine-in or pick-up orders over $15\". When ordering, I confirmed this with the girl on the phone but when I got there the same girl said I needed to print out the menu and bring it in. Annoying, but not a deal breaker unto itself.

The rice (not included with any dish) was expensive and very average - I've never seen indian rice without cardamom seeds until now. Again, not a show-stopper but the \"meh\" factor is increasing...

Most Indian takeout I've had comes with little containers of tamarind sauce, mint chutney and pickled onions - or at least some napkins? Definitely no frills here.

And finally, the food itself. It was ready impressively fast, but what's the rush? Both the Saag Paneer and Butter Chicken were watery and pretty bland. Not particularly awful, but with so much competition in the area they'll have to step it up to be competitors for my return business. I'd take a pass and head down to Trimurti on Queen or one of the delicious buffets on East Gerrard."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in Toronto and easily one of the best restaurants in Etobicoke. I have been enjoying their menu since they opened. Their food is very flavorful and consistent in quality.

Delivery can take a long time but is well worth the wait. A few items I recommend are: gobi manchurian, muttar paneer and the chicken vindaloo.

I highly recommend Kothur to anyone. They are very accommodating to allergies and spice level preference and will alter dishes as required."}
{"text":"Got take out here on a Wed night from Just-Eat - delivery came within 45min.
Two suggestions - BUTTER CHICKEN, and try all their naan

Definitely ordering from them again"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall on Yonge between Bloor and Wellesley.  If you didn't know it was there, you could miss it entirely.  Which would be too bad for you.  This is one of the truly better Indian places in this part of town.  

We went twice and had an assortment of dishes both times: Aloo Bonda (appetizer), Palak Paneer, Butter Chicken, Malai Kofta, Aloo Baingan, Fish Curry, Garlic Naan, Onion Kulcha, Chicken Biryani, Mysore Masala Dosa.  Too much food, right?  Wrong.  My partner and I licked the dishes clean when we went the first time.  The second time, there were 4 of us, and we cleaned up as well.

What made the food so special?  The quality.  The portions were perhaps on the smaller size compared to most other Indian places.  However, we loved the spice mixes and each dish had its own unique flavour.  The fish curry was absolutely amazing - I thought I would hate it, but it was just the right amount of spice and not fishy at all.  Butter chicken actually tasted like butter chicken, not some sweet sickly mess - and real chicken breast, not overcooked and chewy!  The garlic naan was a little oily, but oh well, down it went with all the rest.

Service was also wonderful.  Our waiters were courteous and helpful.  The only thing missing about this place is the decor - for those who care, it needs a facelift.  If you don't care about decor and just want to have some good Indian food, this is the place to go.  For sure our new favourite Indian restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of authentic spicey Indian food. Relaxing atmosphere.  Staff have a low key yet friendly manner."}
{"text":"We've followed Kothur from the original Everest on Lakeshore W.  Food is as good in the new location but seats were more like fast food seating.  My husband and I mentioned to the waitress about it & the next visit we were pleasantly surprised by the new seats. Looks more intimate & cozier.  Thanks for listening to your guests and taking action

Loved the food. I've not found any Indian restaurant that I enjoy as much as Kothur on Lakeshore.  It's a little gem!  Chicken Korma & Sag Paneer are our fav"}
{"text":"Well I love Indian food and this was just disappointing. Only ordered a biriyani and tandoori chicken, thankfully. The Tandoori was bland and looked like it was oven baked. The biriyani was soggy and missing something. Would reco the roti place a few doors down for takeout"}
{"text":"I was there at 1pm on a Saturday and the door was locked. We saw there was a waiter at the bar and we waited outside for a few minutes but no one came to let us in!!!!"}
{"text":"Great, great, great Indian food.  Definitely my favorite in the Yonge/Bloor area.  Highly recommend the Mutter Paneer."}
{"text":"Bottom-line : The food tastes great. I live a stone's throw away from Kothur and have already made it my local for Indian food. I took my family here on a few occasions and they loved the food as well. I have lived in South India for over 25 year and I can vouch for the authenticity of the food that is made at Kothur.

They have great staff who are friendly and courteous. The service speed is acceptable.

If their name board was more visible they could capitalize their Yonge street location better."}
{"text":"I have eaten curries from Birmingham to Delhi, and this one rates.

The flavours were fresh, and the spicing just perfect. I had a little more fire in my Goan dishes than my wife had in her butter chicken, but they got both just right.

Service was warm and friendly, even on a Monday night

I shall return!"}
{"text":"Staff: Extremely friendly and helpful! :)

The food: Its average at best, and nothing to write home about. They use one base for all their curries and thats pretty evident! I ordered home delivery once from here, and found hair in my vegetable biryani -_- gross

Value for money: Definitely overpriced. Given the portion sizes, they charge waaayy too much. And the food isn't even that great for crying out loud.

Ambience: Its alright, nothing too great

My score is actually 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Had a meal delivered yesterday, it was the worse food I've eaten. I have eaten many fine Indian meals from London and across America and Canada but this was the absolute worse ever. So the order was veggie pakora they were dry as hell and clearly just refried, malai kofta these dumplings were nice but the sauce was cold, aloo palak this was just bland as anything it was just pure green blandess, chicken kurma was the worse and dangerous (a piece of chicken was cover and wrapped in plastic), the last items was a keema naan and plain naan both were fine and a plain rice.
It was so bad especially the da house plastic wrapped chicken. After a call to the restaurant and being passed onto the manager all he expressed was humms and arhhhhs. After saying it was very off putting and not a great impression he did seem to care. This place will never get my business again and I hope some people in the catering and food industry take more pride in not just what's produced but have an action plan ready to rectify issues."}
{"text":"the lunch special is amazing and inexpensive! Soup, bread, choice of main, dessert... delicious!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. I recently moved to this neighbourhood and it has been the greatest find. Not only is it inexpensive, the food is absolutely amazing. There are so many choices and everything I have tried has been impeccable. Also, I always have leftovers which are equally as good when heated up! To add a cherry on top, the owners/staff are so friendly and the service is remarkable. We came here for my moms birthday and they insisted on bringing us both a delicious dessert. I love everything about this restaurant and HIGHLY recommend it! Try it for yourself and you will agree!"}
{"text":"Last Night (Oct 16th, 2017 at 9pm) I had the worst experience ever while placing an order over the phone at your establishment. I have never experienced this as I have been ordering food and been visiting your businesses (Kothur & Everest Hakka) for more than 5yrs. The lady (Manvi) who spoke to me was the rudest person I have come across at your establishment. 

The first time when I called to place the order I was asked for my mobile no and she knew that I have been a customer as she could find my details in your system. I placed an order for a dish that is sold at Everest Hakka and was told in a rude manner that this is Kothur and not Everest Hakka. I told her that's fine and after discussing it with my guests decided to cal back.

 

She answered the call again and I told her it's me and the response from her was very very cold. There was no greeting and she came across as not interested in taking my order. I asked her if she has any issues to take down my order as I am a customer who is paying for the food and wants to place an order and her behaviour is coming across as very very rude. The response that i get from her is that \"If you feel I am rude it's your problem\". I couldn't believe the attitude and the response that i was hearing. I reminded her that the first time that I called I felt she was rude as well so the response I get from her is that they were busy(I was placed on hold by her for 2 mins). These are no grounds to be rude to your customers who pay for their food. Manvi has no etiquette regarding customer service. How difficult is it to take an order over the phone? I know Santosh who runs Everest Hakka and how good he and his employees have been to me whenever I have visited them or have placed an order over the call. This is so disappointing as I have been referring my friends to your restaurants. Thanks to her my day and my guests had the worst conversation over dinner. 

Note to Owner: Please take care of this situation as this is hurting your business."}
{"text":"I really liked the place and the food. their indian breads are really good and even the curries are awesome. I'm so glad I found this place ."}
{"text":"Ambiance:
The decor of the restaurant is decent. Nothing shabby. I felt the whole space was slightly small. We were seated right in front of the bar/checkout so it was slightly uncomfortable with people standing right beside us to pay and the bar protruding out and hovering over your head.

Food:
We ordered the Chilli Chicken, Chicken Biryani and Dosa. The chilli chicken and biryani were pretty good. Chilli chicken had a sweet+spicy flavor to it and was slightly crispy. The biryani was made in South Indian style, hence it was rich in flavor. The chicken was tender. The Dosa was not the best, we have had better dosas elsewhere.

Service:
Staff was friendly. Everything came on time and the wait-staff took care of us. 

Value:
The prices were reasonable relative to the quality of food."}
{"text":"I generally don't enjoy eating at downtown Indian food restaurants; somehow I find their blend of spices imbalanced and fake in an attempt to conform to a rather odd Indian food stereotype.

I went to Kothur for lunch with three other colleagues and it was a surprisingly pleasant experience. The place is bit hard to find, tucked away between two large storefronts, one of them being a strip club, I think (Edit: It's next to the Panasonic theatre). There are no windows in this restaurant and the decor is modest. It felt like this space was carved out of an area under a stairwell.

We ordered from the lunch menu which was surprisingly cheap and came with generous portions of food. Soup came first, a watered down lentil and vegetable daal, followed by the main course in stainless-steel containers that reminded me of cafeterias and small eateries in India. Besides rice, a fried bhaji (falafel-ish fried goodness) and generous amounts of naan (people like that awful thing so much!), the menu had over fifteen options for the main entree. We picked different chicken dishes, mine being the 'saag chicken'. There was a rice pudding dessert to finish off with. All this for $8!

The waiter was very friendly and polite, he even offered a complimentary bowl of daal for the table to share. How nice, and how Indian!

Overall I was quite impressed by this restaurant and certainly I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Food was fast and delicious. The service was outstanding! Had little kids with us so it was an early dinner - and meant the restaurant was quiet.  They had a singer who serenaded the kids. Think we will become regulars"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved the food here! Authentic Indian food...
It's a hidden jewel. 
Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times.
It is rare that you see a restaurant that offers both North Indian and South Indian cuisine.
The South Indian dishes (dosa,idli,etc.) are well cooked, the meat dishes are also well made.
However, I am not a fan of the assorted meat dish.
The masala tea is also very good.
Overall a very good place and I highly recommend it if  you are in the South Etobicoke/Mississauga area."}
{"text":"Disgusting place. I could not even eat the food. 30 bucks down the drain. Not fresh and not tender. Old meat and bad taste."}
{"text":"The ambience was decent and Indian. Typical desi, with idols, huge Indian bronze lamps, wall décors and Tamil songs playing in the background. They had copper water pitcher and glasses. Felt that the place was empty for a Friday night. 
Food: They offer complimentary pappads while waiting for the food. We ordered sambar vada, malai kofta, garlic naan and onion kulcha. The food tasted good (average and decent. Didn't feel anything was extraordinary). It was not too pricey and had generous portions.
If you crave Indian food and are in the neighbourhood, do check out this place."}
{"text":"I lived around the block for years and couldn't find this place even when I had instructions and address in hand.but when I finally found this gem it was well worth the effort!

Their food are all delicious and the dishes are plentiful. Between my friend and I we cannot finish a single vegetarian dish nor the side of rice. Potato cakes are well spiced and creamy. My boyfriend took a liking to their mango lassi. Great (albeit slow) service all around makes this a good place for an evening out! 

Two minor suggestions would be 1) turn on a fan for some air circulation if possible, and 2) the storefront should do more to compete with the glowing signage from attached Panasonic theatre."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend to find some cheap & good Indian food in a place that wasn't grungy- found it! I was impressed with the service, and the food was really delicious. Everything that we tried was good, and the atmosphere was pleasant as well. It's hidden away on Yonge near Charles St, hard to find if you aren't looking for it!

+ points for the large variety of types of naan, including whole wheat. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, freshly made, well priced. Place was very cozy, nice music."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food.

My friend's Tandoori chicken was not cooked well, we had to return it and worry about diseases. Too bad... It looked nice from the outside."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch special and had chicken curry. Although the wait to order was a bit slow, the food was good. The chicken was moist and the curry full of spices."}
{"text":"Solid northern indian place in Mimico. Went to get take-out and noticed large Indian family dining there as I was walking up. Good sign!

We had samosas, naan, butter chicken, chickpeas and the blended spinach dish (without cheese). Everything was excellent, and very flavourful. Both the veggie samosa and naan were impressive. Far above standard fare. Samosa was beautifully crisp yet moist on the inside, and the Naan was fluffy - and very large.

Enjoyed the butter chicken a lot; not too runny and beautiful pieces of tender chicken. Both spinach and chickpeas were tasty as well, albeit I found chickpeas slightly underdone.

Next time will be trying more meat dishes. Happy to see a local place thriving!"}
{"text":"Kothur is an Indian restaurant with South Indian owners. With that in mind we were set on ordering 'South Indian' dishes if possible. There were surprisingly few that fit the description (though the menu has over 100 options).

***

Assessment of the food:

Mixed appetizer tray - This was a good sampling of all the appetizers. Unfortunately we found everything had a pretty overwhelming deep fried taste to it. 

Two different soups, both of which were a bit flavourless.

Chicken dish (#35 I think?) that in the description identified itself as 'South Indian'. The flavour of the sauce was very unique compared to any of typical indian dishes served in restaurants.

Tandori Shrimp Sizzler. Large portion and came with a BIG basket of naan bread. Unfortunately it was quite overcooked and didn't have a lot of flavour but I think this dish has a lot of potential. It certainly looks delicious with big succulent sizzling shrimp.

Dosa - this is a staple of South Indian cooking. It's a big pancake filled with a potato based filling (big as in larger than a dinner plate!)

***

In case you can't already tell...we ordered WAY too much food and did a terrible job of ordering a good variety. Our meal was essentially carbs, carbs and more carbs. (Totally our fault).

No air conditioning in the restaurant, but lots of fans to help keep it cool.

Anyway, I honestly haven't had a waiter as sweet, friendly and eager to please as ours was tonight. 5 stars for the smile our waiter's face, but just a two for the somewhat bland food."}
{"text":"Went in in Friday  evening. Restaurant wasn't so busy. Wanted to order a dosa but they refused that it would take 30 mins plus. Ordered other food. We felt non India's for better service than Indians- which was weird. My sister brought take out a week ago and we liked the taste so we thought we would go again but were disappointed at the treatment. Not sure if we would go again. 
Oh and they gave some ppl complementary papadaums and panorama where we didn't get any. Just weird and would not like to go again to be treated differently when I'm bringing them business."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to our Lakeshore condo while moving in with no idea what was in the area. Went with familiar dishes for our first Kothur experience - butter chicken and fish curry. Both exceeded expectations! Looking forward to trying more from Kothur in the future :)"}
{"text":"Yummy, Indian, and veg-friendly.

Walking in, you are at once fearful and hopeful: fearful that, as the narrow space and mostly empty tables suggest, the food may be as questionable as the setting; and hopeful that, since it is clearly a hole-in-the-wall, perhaps you have found a hidden gem.

I would say that Kothur is the latter - a hidden gem. Most entrees are priced around $10-11, give or take a couple dollars (veg dishes tend to be on the cheaper side). Both my friend and I loved the Vegetable Kurma, and I really enjoyed (her) Lamb Xacutti. The garlic naan was also everything I hoped it would be. However, as people have said, the appetizer platter is completely meh. If you want apps, go for the onion pakoras. My friend also liked the cutlets.

Overall, this is a pretty great hole in the wall, and it gets bonus points for having so many delicious vegetarian entrees. I will be back for yummy Indian food (with good vegetarian options, too!) when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I can see that Kothur has opened up a Yonge street one and I cannot wait to try it out as my sister took me to the one on Lakeshore and I loved the food. It was full of flavour. The smell in the restaurant is warm and intoxicating. The wait staff there were very nice, patient and even gave us an extra dish.What is really impressive is that we ordered over seven dishes because there were a lot of us and the wait staff remembered it all. Did not write down anything. That is impressive.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant. I do plan to try the Yonge street location and will see how that goes as the lakeshore location is very far for me to go."}
{"text":"Looked up urbanspoon and tried this restaurant. The service was prompt. Clean and nice interior. Food was made with high quality ingredients; it was a little pricey but probably worth the occasional indulge."}
{"text":"Popular place for lunch and known for their lunch specials. Came here after work for dinner on a Friday night. Lots of tables available. Service was ok. One lady working at the front herself. We pressed a button at our table to order. We ordered butter chicken, malai kofta with naan and rice. Food was delicious and filling. Would come back."}
{"text":"3.5 for the food.
2.5 for the service

Got some take away from here after working up an appetite for Indian by watching the Great British Family cook-off on Netflix.

Susksur Briyani up the street was closed so I ventured to Kothur.

The staff seemed a bit disorganized but I still got my order for chicken tikka, aloo Gobi, naan and onion bhajis. The server told me to come back in 30.

30 minutes later I arrived, only to see my take out bag being hustled back into the kitchen. Someone had forgotten part of my order. 10 more minutes of waiting and I got my food. No apology for the long wait.

The food was a saving grace though. The tikka and aloo Gobi were great as was the naan.

I may try an eat in experience next time as the food for customers sitting down seemed to be coming faster."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we've found a fantastic Indian food restaurant in the west end. My husband and I will frequently make our way to the East side/Little India when we crave indian food but have been looking for something delicious in our neighbourhood. 
We ordered from Kothur over the phone and went in to pick it up 30 mins later. The man on the phone was helpful and nice. When we went to pick it up the restaurant was cozy and there was a gentleman setting up for some lives music on a Saturday night. If we hadn't already been in our 'comfy clothes' for the night, I would have loved to stay and enjoy the music with our meal. 
We ordered quite a bit as it was our first time so there were many thing we wanted to try. We still have leftovers in the fridge. Papadum, raitha, veggie pakora, onion bhaji, aloo gobi, butter chicken, lemon rice and garlic naan. I had everything except the raitha and rice, which my husband said was fantastic. I enjoyed all the food! The naan was huge! Butter chicken was really saucy and the chicken pieces where chunks of really good meat. The aloo gobi was also yummy and saucy. Delicious. We enjoyed the veggie pakora more than the onion bhaji, but both were great. We will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Kothur. It's been a few years since I came here and everything was still good. In addition to the delicious food, the service was excellent, all wines on the list are available by glass, 1/2 litre or bottle and they have little call buttons for service at each table. We never had cause to use the button because our waiter was awesome. 
Probably my favourite Indian restaurant in the city right now. Why no 5 star? The meat was not super succulent and tender. It was good, but could have been cooked differently to make it more delicious.
Otherwise, the sauces were bang on and I'd be happy to come back again."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE BEST!

honestly give them a shot you won't be disappointed. Not over is the butter chicken my favourite in the city but they always get my order right. I like to order extra butter chicken sauce and they always accommodate that. ALSO best service they were close to closing but got my order to me without any hassle. I HIGHLY recommend this place for some great Indian food."}
{"text":"The set lunch price is around $11 tax included it comes with soup, rice, naan and the choice of main u choose. 
For these price in the area is not bad and their food is pretty decent. 
But don't hope for any services if you come here for lunch. Cause is like a one man show for the waiter. If you are in rush for a quick lunch here is not recommended. 
I would say around 3 stars for the decent food and price. Could give it a try if in area and craving for Indian food."}
{"text":"Wow 
The food here was fantastic! We got pickup through just-eat tonight 

The staff are so friendly and it was some of the best Indian I've had in this city

We ordered chicken biryani, naan, lamb curry, chicken korma and beef samosas

The meats were so tender and the sauces very flavourful (Not too watery and not too thick) 

I like that you can adjust the level of spice 
We will be making this our new Indian take out restaurant.

She even called us to tell us the food was ready for pick up 

We will be ordering Indian from here from now on"}
{"text":"Delicious food, very fresh, but service was super slow and the restaurant itself was freeeeezzzzzing on one of the coldest nights of the year. Get the food to-go and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I tried this place out for take-out. 
I've gotta say that I was pleasantly surprised. The portions were a very good size, because most Indian places give you your dish in a small round 
container, this place gave surprisingly large portions. 

The soup was very delicious. I had (the name is escaping me) lentils pureed with veggies, and he didn't add chicken since I told him not to. 

The naan was good, the rice was fine, my eggplant dish was so, so good. 
The chicken masala was mediocre, lacking flavour and spice despite me asking for medium to spicy, but other than that it was a very pleasant meal that lasted me 2 1/2 meals and my fella one meal. 

Prices were average. 

Usually when I get a voucher for something the service is often not as good because they know they aren't getting much money out of it (which is dumb because I won't go back then) but this place knew the benefit and was actually very friendly and kind. 

If you're nearby, try it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening and it was just our table so it was very quiet and awkward. There weren't any music so you basically heard our table talking throughout the entire restaurant. 

The food was amazing and arrived very fast. We tried the butter chicken, lamb biryani, and some garlic naan. The customer service was also fantastic, every staff member was very friendly. 

Overall, I recommend coming here if you want some quick, delicious and affordable Indian food!!"}
{"text":"Great food at decent prices. I'm a fan of the shrimp biryani and garlic naan and have never been disappointed. They can even make it as hot/spicey as you like. If you enjoy indian food, give them a try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The hubby has been raving about this place for months and I finally got a chance to try it with him for lunch. 

Around 12pm it was unusually empty but we were seating and served quickly. The lunch special is $7.99 and comes with soup, a veggie fried thing, another lentil soupy dish I don't know what it is, naan, rice, your choice of entree and a dessert (today a small bowl of coconut milk and tapioca thing).  Tons of food! 

Entrees the list goes on from veggie options, chicken lamb and beef dishes. Had the butter chicken and it's one of the best I've ever had!  

It was a great meal which I could barely finish for an excellent price."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant I have gone to in the Church & Wellesley district of Toronto. I went here after I purchased a dining deal at Rdeals.ca and it was worth every penny.  The decor, ambiance, and service were all great and the food was amazing. The restaurant can be hard to find on the Yonge Street strip as there is no signage large enough to spot it from the street (it's located in a retail space where a former restaurant called the 'Duke of Gloucester' use to be; the former name still remains). 

Food spiciness can be adjusted according to your desire (speak to waiter/waitress when placing your order).  Stay in for dessert if you still have room for it."}
{"text":"Our go-to Indian restaurant is Chutneys but they are so damn expensive. I'm all about paying for good quality but when 2 dishes and plain rice cost over $50 with delivery, it becomes questionable. 

We decided to give this place a go and I'm glad we did. The flavours remind me more of southern Indian dishes (less rich and creamy) but I'm okay with that. The flavour is on point which is key! I would most definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"I work around this area and go to this place occasionally with an Indian coworker.  The decor leaves something to be desired but most of their lunch specials are decent and good value.  For 10 dollars including tax, they have a lunch special which includes soup, rice, naan, lentil, one pakora, side veggies and the main entrees (I usually get butter chicken).

It's cheap food, large portion and a good lunch spot, but not really a date spot"}
{"text":"I wouldn't have known this place was any good until I bought a couple deal vouchers online, but I'm glad I took the chance. I pass by this restaurant all the time and never really noticed it, but now I've been there a few times and it's safe to say that this is my favourite Indian restaurant. 

The decor isn't to be desired but it does have a homey kind of feel to it. One complaint is that it gets pretty cold in the winter time, but the spiciness of Indian food can help that :) 
The service is great, everyone is so nice and very accommodating with the various levels of spiciness for each dish that you order. You get complimentary poppadoms with sauce at the beginning of the meal, and I even got complimentary rice pudding one time - I guess they were very excited with my reactions to their food :P

I'm not sure if the food is absolutely authentic, but it's great. Ordering the mango lassi, vegetable pakoras, and garlic naan every time is a must. I try to order new entrees every time I go, and I am never disappointed. Everything I've ordered so far on the menu has been amazing. The portions are quite big even though its usually shared, but I always take left overs home to enjoy the next day. With an appetizer, extra garlic naan, mango lassis, and 2 shared entrees may sound pricey, but the bill came up to around $40!

Every time I eat the food here, I get so happy - it gets pretty ridiculous at times. I can't stop telling my friends about this place and I would not want this restaurant to go unnoticed. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"We discovered this lovely place a few days ago. I ordered a masala dosa and my friend ordered a plain dosa for take away. To my surprise the dosa weren't available to order until 6:30-7ish because the batter wasn't ready. This is the very reason why I wouldn't give this place 5 stars. The dosas were very good, they came with some sambar ( a bit spicy but still delicious) and mint chutney. 
I will definitely order from this place more often!"}
{"text":"Just had a great dinner at Kothur with friends.

2 of the people with us were pregnant, therefore we had asked for a mild meal - which we did get.  The food was rich and creamy, but somewhat tasteless.
The business caters to its local audience, and not to the Brampton/Mississauga crowd - which they have done well.
We ordered the Paneer Makhni, Saag Paneer, Malai Kofta,and an app plate.
As a Mimico/Long Branch local - this is my favorite indian restaurant when I do not want to drive 35 mins.  
Would I go back? - YES!! (and I'll be ordering the food Spicy!)"}
{"text":"We got delivery from our local Indian restaurant Kothur for the first time. Tucked in  and camouflaged next to the Panasonic theatre, we had never really given it a shot before. It's easy to miss when the eyes are drawn to the classic and blinding Mirvish light-and-poster display. I was excited and hopeful that we'd have another great restaurant in our neighbourhood. Our order:

1. Aloo Gobi (Spicy curried potatoes)
2. Veggie Kurma (Cauliflower in coconut gravy)
3. Veg Paneer (Giant cheese cubes in spinach sauce)
4. Garlic Naan

They were all delicious. The paneer cubes were perfectly shaped and would not have looked out of place in any cube-based films:

Cube
Cube 2: Hypercube
Cube Zero
Hellraiser
Star Trek: First Contact
Anaconda

The Aloo Gobi was as good as any I've had at Amaya (and 2 dollars cheaper) and my first experience with Kurma was postive - it was the only dish there was 'naan' leftover.

Speaking of, my only complaint was that the two orders of naan could have yielded more. We definitely ran out of bread before we ran out of dishes. Thankfully we had supplemented our meal with some extra pita, and weren't hung out to dry, having to drink the remaining sauce out of takeout containers like common vagrants...I would suggest getting one order of naan per person at a minimum. Otherwise, I had a great delivery experience with Kothur, and look forward to giving them a try in person."}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. They feature a special lunch menu that is not featured in detail on their website (Photos of menu provided), which has a wide array of entrees that come with a soup, vegetable pakora, puvlav rice, naan bread, and a dessert of the day. This combo is $8.99 +tax, a great price for what you get. 

The Channa Masala entree was very flavourful. From first glance the portion looks small, but I assure you that your hunger will be satisfied. I asked for the medium spice level and it gave a good kicker, so choose your spice level wisely. The chickpeas were not too firm and not too mushy, the way channa masala is meant to be. I mentioned to the waiter that I was vegan, and when the chef (yes, chef, not the waiter) came to deliver the entrees, he put an individual bowl of rice on my plate because the puvlav rice contained butter. Even though I didn't ask about the rice, they took the initiative to make this change which I very much appreciate. 

The water is served out of a copper ewer and copper cups. It may look like drinking out of the cup will give you tetanus, but rest assured you're A-Okay. Drinking out of copper vessels have been proven to have many health benefits (go look it up!), so don't be alarmed. 

The only thing I'd say can be improved is the service. They should definitely hire more staff during the lunch rush hour. It was hard for us to get hold of our waiter when we wanted to pay our bill, so we ended up walking to the counter to pay. 

Overall, a satisfying experience with tasty food at a great price despite the lack of staff available. Would recommend if you're looking for some authentic Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Had lunch.  We were a group of 6, but were seated with no problem, as there was only one table sat in the entire restaurant.  Two of my group got their meals, while the rest of us waited an additional hour after they received theirs (and finished eating).  After an hour, we asked what was going on, as our server had at that point been ignoring us.  Finally, food arrived, except for one person's meal.  They did not punch his order through, so they began to make it then.  A \"apologies for the wait\" was made, but at that point, I had already decided never to return.  No bills were brought to our table, so we went up to pay.  The food was good and that redeemed my experience at least a little bit, but my lunch break from work ended up being 2 hours +, which is just unacceptable.  If you're looking for decent Indian food but have a million hours to wait, go for it, but I'd recommend Banjara 100x over."}
{"text":"You might not notice this unassuming narrow restaurant while walking along Yonge Street, but you'd be missing out some really tasty dishes.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, and made us feel very comfortable right from the start.  We had Onion Bhajia, Rasam Soup, Channa Masala, Lamb Biriyani, Butter Chicken, Shrimp Coconut Masala, Veg Kurma, and Naan.  For desert, we tried the Rice Pudding, Russ Malai, and Mango Ginger Ice Cream, along with Chai tea.

The only dish that underwhelmed was the Shrimp Coconut Masala.  The shrimp were small and overcooked/chewy.  The favourites were the Channa Masala, Lamb Biriyani, and the Rasam Soup (which only one of us had).  The deserts were amazing, especially the homemade ice cream.  The Butter Chicken was okay, but could have been a bit more tender.

Overall, we really enjoyed our meal, the atmosphere, and the service, and we would return to try more items on the menu.  The whole meal for four people, including four beers, came to about $124, taxes included.  With a good tip ($22), that's about $36.50 per person.  We had a coupon discount, so it was even cheaper."}
{"text":"Hey!

Just ordered take out from this place. Delicious. Portion sizes were fair. Naan was divine. Pakora, Palaak Paneer, Aloo Gobi, Fish Curry, Vegetable Kurma, SO GOOD. Thanks Kothur! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of indian food. And I had never heard of Kothur. But my take out app listed it. So I thought I would give it a try. My delivery was amazing. I ordered the palak paneer, chicken vindaloo, beef kahrai and a chicken biryani. The food tasted so fresh. The spices were a great level of flavour and heat. The beef was soft and flavourful. The chicken was white meat and well cooked. The rice was nicely cooked. And the best part is that there wasn't pools of oil on top like some places can give. The prices were great. I spent $60 and received 4 large dishes plus two ras malai desserts. I'll be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"two thumbs up!  have only done delivery and takeout and both have been great.  food is always piping hot.  paneer makhani is f'ing delicious.  like, crave-able.  i like everything on the menu and i can never not order this damned dish from here!

would give 5 stars but the biryani (which is one of the dishes i measure a restos true ability) is abysmal.  sorry kothur, but you do have a bit of work to do here."}
{"text":"It's truly a hole in the wall place. So far I have been there twice both times with a dealsharing coupon. The first time service was extremely slow, but the food was great, the second they did right. Service was courteous and speedy, the food was very good for the price we are paying. Butter chicken and lamb Saag with garlic naans, to die for. I was extremely pleased. Even without coupons I'd say they are pretty reasonably priced. So yes, definitely will go back there again, and will recommend it to friends. 

On a side note, the place is quite small, so probably not good for large gathering."}
{"text":"Updating my review...

Their food was delicious and inexpensive but now they failed their health inspection and their service has gone so downhill. They always seem to be understaffed and don't allow groups to pay individually, raised their prices twice and have a conditional pass. No longer coming here... "}
{"text":"Nice and quiet place in downtown on yonge street. The food is good. Decent Indian food around this area."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall type of restaurant - very cosy with lovely live music on Saturday night to complement the meal.
The menu is extensive and we haven't ordered anything bad to date.  Portion sizes are generous, lots of flavour for reasonable price.... Staff is courteous and knowledgeable about the food.  

I can't comment on take out / delivery experience, I know sometimes it differs from a sit down meal."}
{"text":"The butter chicken and curry fish are always simply delicious. We come here almost three times a week! Best curry place downtown."}
{"text":"This is the same as the old Everest (which was across the street.)

The Butter Chicken is delicious. Combined with the Lemon rice and Naan bread it is a wonderful meal. 

If you don't have time to eat in they do take-away to."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. My friend and I shared a chicken biryani because we were not that hungry, but the waitress seemed annoyed that we only got one thing. We got medium spicy but felt like the kick was non-existent.

The atmosphere in this restaurant was soooo awkward. It was DEAD SILENT even though there were three other tables there when we walked in. There was no music and it was almost as if the walls were sound-proof. The waitress was pretty awkward too, it seemed like she didn't really know how to waitress because she tried to stack our plates on top of each other with utensils between them. She ended up dropping something.

Overall, it was okay. Would go back for food if desperate for Indian food and all other restaurants were closed, maybe..."}
{"text":"First impressions while we wait for our food: 5pm and a completely empty restaurant. We had to walk all the way into the back, into the kitchen, to get someone's attention and seat/serve us. The server is uninterested, but brought out the water and pappadum with chutneys very quickly. On an amusing note, one of the songs playing was \"1 2 3 4 get on the dance floor, booty shake booty shake booty shake\" hahaha. 

On the less bright side, they only have dosas on weekends, which is what I came for. Pout!

Appetizers came out after several minutes (sampler platter) and was quite good, if greasy.  

Food (malai kofta and mutter paneer) was delicious and particularly enjoyed by my dinner date, although very mild and not flavorful enough for me. Also unsure if it was actually malai. My south Asian bias familiarity kicks in...

VERY unimpressed that the server brought out our bill before we were done eating, without asking if we wanted anything else (what if I wanted dessert?) In a completely empty restaurant. Such a rush to kick out paying patrons?"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here.

I specifically asked for no cilantro. No cilantro. I even said \"please\", because I'm polite like that. Not only did every dish have cilantro in it, but it did not seem to be just cilantro that was cooked in; cilantro was added in top. Generously. Like, tonnes of it. On the soup, on the vegetarian dish, and on the chicken dish.

Very disappointing.

(I get that they can't make certain dishes to order without cilantro. I do. If I ran a restaurant and someone mentioned a food intolerance, I'd either accommodate it, OR tell the customer that the intolerance couldn't be accommodated and suggest alternative dishes.)"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends for Sunday lunch.  We all ordered the $7.99 lunch special.  Tasty but everyone left still a bit hungry.  FYI, we thought the  bowl of rice that was brought to the table was kinda large for one person but, once we discovered it was meant for all four of us to share, we freaked!"}
{"text":"In my ever lasting journey to find the best take-out butter chicken in town, I can finally say that Kothur Indian Cuisine's butter chicken is a buttery oasis of DE-licious! And I have proof!

Some friends got together for a Butter Chicken contest, ordering it from our six (6) favourite places. Then we set up a blind tasting table with the dishes labelled 'A' through to 'F', and then got to it. 

After hours of tirelessly dipping our naan, through over two rounds of furious debate, our butter chicken soldiers finally settled in a vote of 8 to 12, that the best butter chicken in town was Kothur Indian Cuisine.

Kothur's butter chicken stood out for being
-deliciously sweet, yet very spicy (there is an option of mild medium or spicy, whereas most butter chicken is just mild)
-not too thick, not too thin, buttery texture
-perfectly cooked chicken pieces (the best cooked meat at the table)
-beautiful mercury like sheen

My only complaint is that there wasn't enough of the perfectly cooked chicken pieces."}
{"text":"Ordered veggie platter, dal makhani, paneer makhani, naan and tea which costed approximately $40 for two people given how much we ate and still had some leftovers. The place was tiny and cozy and had some tamil and bollywood songs playing in the background. The service was quick with decent and cheap indian food in downtown toronto. Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"In general my experience has been that Toronto has amazing Indian food. We ate at Kothur for lunch and it was definitely not amazing, though it was a lot of food for a decent price. For $7.99 we each got the lunch special which included rice, a choice of dish, a piece of naan, a potato and peas dish, and rice pudding. We ordered mattar paneer and aloo saag. Both of them were fine but not particularly flavorful. It wasn't that anything was bad, it just didn't have a ton of flavor either. Service was friendly and it was an ok meal, but there are so many options in Toronto that I can't see going back here."}
{"text":"Small space with friendly service.  The food was good and cooked fresh.  The place was clean and relatively busy.  The price point was appropriate for the food quality and portion size.  Will try this place again soon."}
{"text":"Food was better than average but the staff needs training. They were finding it difficult to place vessels and make enough space on the table. We had to move stuff around ourselves. Also they initially gave us just a knife and fork which I think is silly for an Indian restaurant, because it's difficult to eat most Indian dishes especially the ones with Rice without a spoon.

Also the tables need to be replaced or at least covered using some good table cloths as they have scratches, dents etc"}
{"text":"One of the best in the area. It's way cheaper than the fancier Indian across the road from it, but not at all compromising. 

Lots of the standard variety, tasty curries, quick delivery in the area, and friendly staff. 

It's kinda a standard go-to Indian takeout... Especially for the North American pallet, but it's solid comfort food and reheats like a champ for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner last night and used Google Maps to locate this place - it's really not easy to spot next to all the bigger, flashier signs. I used a voucher here, so I had a bit of a discount. I'm not sure that I'd return for full price because the portions were pretty tiny compared to other places, but I didn't feel the quality really compensated for this. 

I had Aloo Baingan, Chicken Tikka, and Shrimp Tandoori with plenty of Naan bread.  My favorite was the Shrimp, which arrived sizzling hot and with plenty of grilled veg. The Aloo Baingan was also good, although I would have liked a higher ratio of eggplant:potato. I'm not sure what was going on with the Chicken Tikka; it just didn't taste right to me. The chicken was a bit mushy - not exactly fresh I'd say.

The Naan bread was a big disappointment - I could swear I tasted margarine, and the bread itself was a bit dry and overly chewy. I'm not sure if margarine is commonly used on Naan bread, but that ruined it for me.

My friend and I were kept in high supply of delicious Papadum while we waited for our food, and the service was excellent. Large pitchers of water are provided to every table.  Bathrooms are clean-ish and quite chilly. Just something to keep in mind for the winter weather."}
{"text":"This is a good Indian restaurant and judging by the name, which is a town in Southern India, they are owned or specialize in southern Indian cuisine so butter chicken is not their forte. The price is decent, portions are generous and the food tasted fine. They have vegetarian dishes, meat dishes (somehow they consider chicken not meat as it has its own non-meat category on the menu, many appetizers, alcohol and dessert). The chicken pakora was light, yet tasty. The Chicken Chettinadu was absolutely delicious and the chicken was moist. The rice was extra, but very well done and tasty. Good job with that fluffy rice! They also allow you to adjust the spiciness of your order.
The food was served in copper bowls and the water was poured into copper cups. Those are nice touches.
The décor was typical Indian restaurant with the carpet, decorations and dripping chandeliers.
The washroom was clean, which is appreciated. The outside sign is small and sitting under a pub it may be difficult to locate them.
The waiter was a little rushed and overwhelmed, but he got help somewhere in the middle and moreover was quite friendly and cooperative. He was happy to do the bill per instructions, bring more of this or that (more water and more bread and chutney...) and seemed kind.
The only reason not to give them five stars is that their specialty and South India's famous food Dosa (Indian tortilla or crepes) was not available at all. Yes, the five or six kinds on the menu were all unavailable. That is like Swiss Chalet not having the Quarter Chicken isn't it?"}
{"text":"These guys are great again!! The chefs are the same!Can't believe how much I enjoyed their food. Only missing from before was before had perfect decor 7-this is still fairly charming... The service was delightful. Don't I repeat don't... miss this gem*"}
{"text":"Best butter chicken in all of Toronto ,generous portions, Great selection of vegetarian dishes, beautifully baked nan bread The best kind it is garlic, inexpensive prices, very friendly staff to go out of their way to make you feel comfortable with their menu... They even ask you your spice level"}
{"text":"Don't get the lunch special, the quantity is too small. I would rather that they charge more than have to look for a Wendy's afterwards."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favourite indian food restaurants in the GTA. Amazing butter chicken, naan and actually, everything is just fantastic. 

Make sure to try the mango lassi's here if you like that sort of thing. They're excellent! And the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Average food and service. Enjoyed it as much as i would enjoy most other restaurants. Nothing notable worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Horrible service, which is a shame because their food is great and price is also attractive. I came in here at 2:30pm for a late lunch. They close at 3pm for lunch (reopen a couple hours later for dinner) but the waitress didn't inform me until AFTER I got my food, which at that point was already 2:40pm-ish. A snake move by the restaurant trying to get your money - not happy. They should have informed me that they were closing soon as soon as I walked into the restaurant. I ended up having to rush through my lunch which was hot and sizzling. I still left a tip because my parents taught me better."}
{"text":"Ah hell no! 

I went here for three reasons: firstly, having passed this restaurant many times, I had never noticed it and that intrigued me.  Secondly, I read a few decent reviews for it.  Most importantly, they have dosa on the menu which I haven't had for a long time and I miss it so.

I kind of liked the campy interior hence the two stars.  My partner said it reminded him of Scarborough basements of childhood friends' houses.  My friend said it reminded her of \"that\" restaurant you see in various Indian movies.  I think they both have a point.  I didn't like the fact that there was only one other customer in the restaurant, but hey, we were there now, so we might as well sojourn on.  

My hopes vanished when I ordered the masala dosa and was told they didn't have dosa that night.  Wha WHAT???  After unsuccessfully trying to recover from my disappointment, I completely abdicated responsibility and allowed the rest of the table to order.  I knew I was in safe hands anyway.

Unfortunately, I didn't like any of the dishes except the naan which was decent.  I only had one small sampling of each dish and even that I didn't finish.  Before we left the restaurant my face was burning.  I am very allergic to MSG and a few other food additives, so that's not too surprising.  What was surprising was by the time we hit the streetcar, my partner's face was on fire too.  Believe me, it wasn't the spice in the dishes because even though we ordered them medium hot, I didn't find them remotely spicy.  I'm not sure what stuff they're putting in their curries, but both of us had a terrible case of gut rot.  It was so bad that the leftovers ended up in the garbage can at the corner of Queen and Broadview.  

I suppose it's needless to say, but just in case, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried to go to this restaurant on a recent Saturday evening.

The place was almost empty, a bad sign. A waitress pointed  a table without a word.She looked upset We sat and waited. 

We continued waiting. No water. No menu. No waitress. I turned around a few times trying to get the staff's attention at the far back of the room. So were two other couples. No luck. Some staff was behind the counter .
This went on for a good 15 minutes. 
So we left."}
{"text":"Great food and good quantity for the price. We had the lunch special and it was pretty good. Loved the naan."}
{"text":"I came here for a dosa as I was craving one. Service was fast and friendly but the dosa was very thick and spongy, none of it was crisp at all. I was very disappointed. The sambar was good, the coconut chutney had a very weird flavor. The masala potatos inside were big chunks with runny liquid, nothing I've ever experienced before and very strange. Normally it's one of my favourite meals but I will have to find somewhere else to go for dosa."}
{"text":"The ambience and food are good. We ordered the navaratna curry, chicken biryani, masala dosa, and garlic naan as main course. They served us pakoras and papad which were complimentary. It's a small place but simple and neat. I liked the South Indian vibe to the place. The server and chef were very friendly and courteous, they made sure we felt welcome and enjoyed our meals. Unfortunately, the dosa was cold and the sambhar that accompanies dosa was cold and had no salt or flavouring. The biryani was spicy and super delicious. The navaratna curry was a disappointment as it didn't live upto our previous experience. It is supposed to be a little sweet rather it was spicy. We had gulab Jamun with vanilla ice cream, and mango ginger ice cream. They gave us 2 gulab Jamuns with 2 small scoops of vanilla ice cream which was just about perfect. The mango ginger ice cream was unique and the sharp taste of ginger was quite striking. The portions were generous for a couple but not enough for more than that. Overall, the service and the food are good."}
{"text":"I recently ordered the vadas and Sambar to go along with a madras coffee. 
I fully expected the vadas to lose their crispiness on the outside and would have been ok with that, however, they placed 4 very small vadas in a styrofoam container that were soft on the outside and gooey on the inside. They seemed undercooked. 
The sambar was thick in consistency which is not that I was expecting - sambars are usually light and help cut into the oil that the accompanying food is cooked in. 
Lastly the madras coffee tasted ok as a latte but was definitely not a madras coffee. 
I don't think I will be returning here"}
{"text":"Food was pathetic I won't even give a zero star.  Gobi Manchurian was bitter and oily.  Sizzlers oh my God you call that one ??? Raw and uncooked very bad experience don't even get in that direction"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and for the most part were pretty happy with the order.  Portions are larger but matches the price.  

Love the kid options and the different bread selections were great as its not usual to have that large a selections

Palak paneer and Lamb curry were a hit for us- will need to try out more of the menu soon"}
{"text":"Kothur IS NOT Everest Cuisine. Both are located within several meters from each other on opposite sides of Lakeshore Blvd.  
Food was bland. Everything was water based. I can understand trend to serve healthy, saltless food but I don't go to an Indian restaurant for that ! It should be creamy, and rich and heavy to be authentic. It was not. 
Mutter Panner described in the menu as \"Home made cottage cheese and green peas cooked in creamy sauce\" was an expensive for its size small bowl of tasteless sauce with couple pieces of equally tasteless pieces called home made cheese.
Chicken Tikka Masala and chicken Vindaloo differed by spiciness and while sauce appeared to be thick underneath there was water. Again - it resembled healthy heart diet. It was bland. It was not exciting. It was boring. My colleague liked it and I hated it. 
Water in a pitcher was warm and with no ice. There were no lemon slices available. 
They offered no extra condiments, no pickled carrots or lemons or yogurt. A waitress said that I'd have to pay for it separately.  I think she noticed how dissatisfied I was with their food because she decided to bring me a sample of mixed pickled veggies for free - now that was the only thing that actually made any Indian sense !
So - two stars for the effort with pickles otherwise I'll stick to authentic Indian dishes in Brampton and Malton in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a coworker and was so surprised by this whole in the wall. Way better than the Biryani House down the street at Hayden and at around the same pricepoint. The lunch special is amazing and so much food for such a fair amount of money."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Gave me the wrong order but didn't do anything about it. Server did not apologize but rather insisted that it was my fault. However, the female server was very sweet."}
