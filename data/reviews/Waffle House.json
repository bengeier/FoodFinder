{"text":"Service was great.  Food was delicious.  Small place compared to Ihop overall a good experience and the food wasn't greasy like the reviews stated.  (5030 W McDowell Rd Phoenix, AZ 85035-3945)"}
{"text":"I've been to many a Waffle House in my life. This is one of the best I've been to. Extremely friendly staff, the greeter Martha gave us all hugs- I mean come on what could be better. Our waitress was on top of our drinks and made sure we were happy. I love good service and good food, and Waffle House nails it when it comes to good traditional breakfast food. One of the few breakfast places that can actually cook an egg over medium the right way. All star special is the best deal-get it! I don't go to Waffle House and expect fancy, I just expect good food and friendly staff- you will get both here."}
{"text":"The Tabasco crusted chicken is amazing. Haven't had anything there that isn't outstanding. The service is always great and the atmosphere is very nice."}
{"text":"Well rude staff. Kitchen was dirty.  Waitress forgot my drink...twice and  the bun looked wrinkles and smashed, won't be back for sure."}
{"text":"No problems and first time here. Had a great waitress! Good food!"}
{"text":"The service was great, but it did need a good cleaning some good tlc.. The restrooms were disgusting,  the food was great."}
{"text":"Omelets (two eggs) at this Waffle House tend to be the best in Charlotte (depending on the cook).  Server should be able to spot a not so perfect omelet and send it back to the cook for a remake. Cost of a meal (with tip) is on the high side for breakfast.  Coffee is OK. You have to ask for cream and Splenda if that is what you use. Bacon can be really ugly if the grill hasn't been cleaned in a while. This has happened maybe once or twice. Normally bacon is good. Toast is normally half toasted (warmed bread is more like it). If you like it that way, go for it. I like bread toasted where it is crunchy.  Eggs are usually done the way you ask.  Cheesy eggs are very good (scrambled with american cheese). Staff? Well what can I say...you takes your chances. Some are very good; some are horrid."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, always in the middle of the night because it's across the street from my data center, and I always leave here full and happy. The servers are always friendly and the foods cooked quickly and to order. It's not the best breakfast in town, but it's probably better than you can make at home... and with none of the cleanup work. Waffle House seems to get a bad rep, be it for the food, cleanliness, or servers... but there's nothing bad to write home about here. Give them a try... I'll bet you'll leave happy too!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service everytime.  They serve the best breakfast in town."}
{"text":"Tonight sucked ass. We got seared. Waited over 15 min to . Had some guest sit down after us and they got THIER order and check before we even got our order taken. Our waitress looks like she is a meth head. Whole staff stood around bull shitting   Finally got our order and I didn't even get my entire order. She finally asked after we was done if everything was ok and I said no would of been nice to get my whole order.  Will never come back here again. I will eat McDonald's cold stale food before coming here again"}
{"text":"I mean.. It's a Waffle House but it used to be a Waffle House that was cleaned once a day. Now it's a little closer to every other day which is a bummer for those of us who remember it being built."}
{"text":"Delicious diner food! If you order the All-Star meal ask them wait to make your waffle until you're ready for it, that way it's hot and fresh! Bring a jacket it's Antarctica in here!"}
{"text":"I ate at this location today and it was a disaster. Nobody knew what they were doing. One waitress shoved food in her mouth right in front of us and continued to touch other people's food with bare hands. There was at least three waitresses that were grabbing people's food with bare hands and one grabbed a piece of bacon off floor with hands then grabbed other bacon and put it on someone's plate with bare hands. This place should be shut down. It is very unsanitary and chaotic"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review and I'm only writing it because it's my responsibility as a human. First thought once I sit down is this place is filthy, maybe the staff had a long busy night. I believe it was a server or manager but this lady that didn't have gloves was grabbing dirty dishes using her fingers to clean them in the dish sink and immediately after begins packing to go orders without once stopping to wash her hands.   A few moments later the same woman was walking through the kitchen with an open container of degreaser chemicals. I found this odd but decided maybe it was a grease emergency. After dispatching of the chemical degreaser the woman once again failed to wash her hands.  As I was eating and watching these woman wash dirty dishes with their fingers. I see one woman grab a paper towel to dry her dirty hands and head towards one of her tables. At the table she takes their cups for refills and uses her dirty hands to fill the cups at the soda fountain before bringing them back...that is when I left mid bite.  I don't recommend going here at this time."}
{"text":"This is what I've come to expect from Waffle House. Great food with excellent customer service. My new home store since the one two blocks from my house is run by a cranky, sarcastic non-clean district manager (Kyle I was told is his name)"}
{"text":"Normally great food and service. Today was a different story. Employee cutting/making food without gloves. I asked him to put gloves on before he prepared my food and I was met with attitude. He sarcastically told me he has been busy and washed his hands 9 times already. When I asked for the manager, he told me he was the regional manager. Continued with sarcasm and rude comments. I walked out with my 2 starving kids.  I live 2 blocks away and I. Won't. Be. Back."}
{"text":"Floors are dirty. No choice of soda as they are all flat & no one seems to know what to do to fix the problem. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually like waffle house but I will never go to this one again! Our waitress was a straight up bitch and I was so polite to her. She was rude in the way she talked to me and my friends and she rolled her eyes at me. All I even said was that I would like water when she asked what we wanted for our drinks. I just let it go cuz I figured it's late and she's grumpy but seriously it was rude"}
{"text":"Waffles r the best!!! I love their waffles! Our waitress was soo sweet and nice also. I had the ribeye and eggs. And my bf got a breakfast sandwich and we added a waffle. The ribeye is not good but u can't expect much from it cuz it's $9.99 and the breakfast sandwich is yummy! I would definitely go here again it's cheaper and better than Denny's or ihop hands down"}
{"text":"Eeeeewwwww!!!! Nastiest place I have ever visited. Brought my family here for the very first time(out of state visitor)ended up walking out due to unsanitary reasons. Not only was the restaurant filthy but some of the employees were even filthier looking. I do not want people like that making or handling my food."}
{"text":"Late night great food as always.  Very clean, and staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! By far the best waffle I've tasted. Excellent service and clean facilities. I only tried their waffle and hashbrowns and regret not ordering more. Everything was made fresh to order in a timely manner. 10 out of 10 would eat again"}
{"text":"Not expecting good quality, its a waffle house. However, I expect them to value their coupons. It was in multiple places online, including a coupon app where I had showed it to her. Instructions said to present to your server. The confused waitress brought over two other people who told me I had to print it or give them a code. Nowhere did it say I had to print it, and there was no code."}
{"text":"We walked in no greeting or anything. Waited close to 10 minutes for a table to be wiped off. Finally sat down. Waited about 4 minutes to be acknowledged then when our waitress came over not a good morning but what y'all drinking. We told her waited about another 3 minutes to get drinks. Then she comes back what you eating today. Never told her name, no greeting or anything. She brings the waffles out 5 minutes before the other food. The toast was burned black couldn't eat it. She sets our check on the table and leaves. When we checked out the lady at the register didn't say 2 words handed me the slip to sign. As we were walking out another waitress told us to have a good day. Maybe they were having a bad day. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Normally I love the Waffle House. The Help Wanted sign on the door should have been a clue. No greeting (which is always our favorite part). The tables hadn't been cleaned so we waited 5 minutes before sitting down. Still no service. They had one cook and 2 helpers with 4 tables waiting on orders. Cold waffles were returned. That was our cue to leave. Please join the Waffle House staff so we can enjoy our next experience there. They could really benefit from nice folks greeting the diners as is customary at this establishment."}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing! Food came out very quick and was cooked perfectly! Jessica was our waitress and she was so sweet and helped us out! LOVED my first experience at waffle house and will definitely be back again! (If i could give this place a bunch more stars i would)"}
{"text":"These people are fucking ridiculous and clueless. I sat at the bar while some incompetent server tried to take an order from people who didn't have a clue what they wanted. They then proceeded to ignore everyone at the bar. After 10 minutes I walked out and wasn't even noticed.  I won't waste my time at this hell hole again."}
{"text":"Do not I repeat do not go to this Crap hole Waffle House it's super ghetto and the people behind the counter were arguing about serving customers even though it's their job I went to IHOP great food"}
{"text":"Well, I go here pretty often. You would think this would be one place to get hot coffee. Nope. It's often cold, and they don't care enough to make fresh. Just recently, I had a waitress on the night shift try to jip me out of a $14 dollar tip. ALWAYS check your receipt and look at what your signing if using a debit card. Today, I went in and didn't get a refill at all of tea while the waitress sat on her butt talking. So yeah, not good experiences here."}
{"text":"Love the Waffle House!  Scrambled eggs with cheese and chocolate chip waffles were excellent.  Had the same waiter twice (Jeremiah, I believe) and it was very evident that he's got a lot of enthusiasm for his job.  Hard to have a bad day after being waited on by him!"}

{"text":"I definitely agree with Amy A.'s review.  I came here tonight (a Tuesday evening around 5:00). I could count on my hand the number of other people in the place. There were two servers and one cook. The other people already had their food. We sat down and still waited 5-10 minutes before a server came and greeted us, asking what we'd like to drink. We each ordered a coffee and I a drink. Another 10 minutes go by before we get our coffee...but no water! She took our food order...pork chops for me and eggs for who I was with. Not a hard order. 30 minutes later they finally come back and my water is still no where to be seen (it came a couple minutes later).  The pork chops were rubbery and had nothing to them. It came with hashbrowns and salad from a bag. Her scrambled eggs weren't cooked all the way. When we asked for more coffee she didn't come back. We finally had enough and got up to go. Can you believe that the server had lost our ticket? So she made up some number and charged us.  Never coming back and this experience has put me off from any Waffle House. The place was unsanitary: flies, gross build up on the table edges, sticky floor, splotches on the tables, etc. You'd think this Waffle House in particular would look much better and have better service being so close to a decent hotel and sort of off the I-10. The location at Baseline and Priest is much better. They're normally packed but deliver impeccable service. Doesn't matter we're not going to any one of these places again. 1 star is too much."}
{"text":"Food was good, but could have done without the manager running her mouth and keeping the staff at her attention while she would rant. That kind of talk should be done outside the business, not in front of  customers. I've seen other employees fired for that type of behavior. Our waitress was friendly and kept our drinks filled."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with the fact that I love Waffle House. However, tonight was just unacceptable. I stopped by this particular location in the early hours of around 2:45am. After sitting, I wasn't approached by anyone. Not one server - until 3:13, 23 minutes of being ignored.  This type of customer service was unbelievable and I will not be returning to this Waffle House. This was the slowest service I have ever received (in ANY restaurant may I add) and the poorest form of communication. I wasn't even offered a, \"we're sorry for the wait.\", of even a simple, \"Hello.\" No, what I got was, \"is this for here or to go?\" Very personal.   Being a patron and supporter of Waffle House since I was a child, this was just a terrible overall experience and sucks to know that I won't be returning to the closest location to my apartment. I'll make the drive over to the location on University next time."}
{"text":"I frequently come to this location at various times of the night. Typically around 3am, after work. I usually have Malik as my server and he is just fantastic. He is very energetic, funny, and quick to take your order and cater to whatever you need.   Just the other day, I saw him conversing with another patron and they were both laughing and having a good time. He's definitely a good employee.   If you're in need of breakfast food that's 24 hours, Waffle House is your place.  Loss of star is only because sometimes the place can seem just a little dirty, but then again, I always visit at the graveyard shifts - so I can't really complain.  I'm definitely going to continue to eat here and recommend it to my friends for our late night endeavors."}
{"text":"This was the worst one I've ever been to! The service sucked starting from the second we walked in the door. No one greeted us or even acknowledged us!! It took awhile for our waitress to pay any attention to us and I had 2 kids with me!! I will never again go to this waffle house! The only reason it gets a star is because I had to!!"}
{"text":"What can one say about Waffle House????  Texas bacon cheesesteak (somehow trademarked) melt with hash browns smothered, covered and topped (with Bert's chili, again trademarked).   Tastes great, but I'm sure it shortened my life!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Clean restaurant! Waffles are great and steak was cooked perfect."}
{"text":"Wiped table immediately, coke was a-a-amazing! Food was like I was eating in heaven on a cloud. Oooow! I tell you child, this is heaven on earth. The waffles are like nectar dripping from teets and the bacon like eating a crispy angel. This is the place to be."}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you want hair in your food!!!! This is was a complete let down ! I had to remind my waitress to get my coffee, she didn't get our order right and the was hair in the hash browns GROSS"}
{"text":"Nicest staff you will ever see.  Even in the middle of the night or on Christmas Day (I was there this Christmas).   The food is, of course, delicious and they are incredibly accurate with orders.  And SO NICE.  They can't make much in tips, but they are so incredibly nice.  The service is top notch."}
{"text":"I want to say thank you waffle House on baseline and i-10. Everyone is nice and good customer service.this is my new favorite location. Thanks again. Manager is really nice"}
{"text":"We are Waffle House nuts and if there is one anywhere near where we travel, we go there.  In the last year alone we have probably visited at least 12 different locations in half a dozen states.   Having said that, I have to say that this was the worst that we have ever seen.  We were there at 11 AM. Not that busy. No greeting. Got a booth right away. Sat there for over 5 min. Before we stoped a wait person to be waited on. Trash on main floor, and on kitchen floor, not cleaned up in 40 min we were there. No refill on drinks until we stoped someone. No pickup of dirty dishes on our table as they were emptied or on other tables after patrons left."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times knowing I'm a precise person make a point to tell my waitress this before hand, I don't find their cooks to be very good at all they had to redo my over medium eggs like 3 times waffles twice they gave me my friends bacon and her my hash browns considering we were 3 of the 5 people total in the restaurant there are no excuses! would not go back ever !!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service and food tonight from the swing shift crew! Sad, but this will be my first negative review on Yelp.  Waffle House #1208 (480) 833-0005 1831 SOUTH COUNTRY CLUB MESA, AZ 85210  My wife and I are regular customers at this Waffle House on Country Club Dr.  On Wednesday night, we brought our whole family to eat. The location was not busy. There were 2 other customers in the restaurant & 3 crew members working - 2 servers and a cook.   The food took twice as long to arrive as usual.  The waffles were burnt, there were eggshells in the eggs, the toast was cold, and food items were forgotten.  When we received the bill, the amount was $15 more than usual, yet we had not ordered anything different from previous visits.  We observed that possibly this was because they had itemized every single food item instead of grouping into meal specials as regularly advertised on the permanent menus.  I had to leave early with a few of our children.  My wife stayed behind to pay for the bill.  After my wife requested they re-calculate the ticket, the servers were surprisingly rude.  They said that their manager told them that they were not allowed to combine items into the meal deals and they refused to accomodate our request.  My wife was more upset about their poor attitude in their reaction rather than the actual initial concern of being overcharged.    The staff's unprofessional and rude interaction (combined with the longer-than-normal wait times and poor quality food) was the main reason why my wife was so upset when she left the restaurant.   This is by no means the average experience that we have had as regular customers.  We understand that employees are human and can have bad days too.  But feedback is essential for companies and management to see experiences from a customer's viewpoint and identify areas of potential improvement."}
{"text":"I'd like to thank our server, Krisslynn whose name I hope I've spelled accurately.  My wife and I were there the other night to eat dinner.  She was so sweet and helpful.   We had a local newspaper's coupon and though my wife's dinner would have been twenty-cents extra, she allowed it under the $6.00 price off your second meal.   Krisslynn was very patient in explaining what a \"basted egg\" was to my wife.  My wife loved it most importantly.  That was her meal choice. The server/waiter's warmth, charm, knowledge of the menu and interpersonal skills make us want to come back for those alone.  Oh, I want to try a basted egg, too as my wife adored them."}
{"text":"For a place open 24 hours it was a welcome site. Remembering a couple of years ago staying at the Hilton Garden Inn that was across from this place. We had arrived to late to find some decent place in Scottsdale and even the hotel seemed like it wouldn't do.   We arrived and sat down at the counter looking over the menu. It was front and back and there was a variety of items to eat. It was strange eating breakfast at night, but then again there's always Denny's right? Well we sat down and started to stare at the menu trying to decide.   I ended up ordering a grill chicken sandwich and that being the only thing I ate as a true meal it was decent. I did want to try the waffles to compare it to Country Waffles, but I didn't want to feel really full.   It was decent and made to order which was nice. However, sitting where I was sitting I knew most of the items on the menu were prepared before hand. The salads were done and placed into bowls ready to be served on a plate. The orange juice was in a machine that keeps running to make sure it's not sitting still was scary. It looked like one of those machines you see at Orange Julius. The orange juice was in buckets ready to be refilled.   Overall, I thought it was a little creepy and disturbing in the restaurant. If I had a choice I'd make sure that the airlines would have informed us that the luggage was already set a side. I wished that we'd got back into town to eat at a real restaurant before everything closed. Good for a snack, but not a place I'd want to return to unless desperate."}
{"text":"Being from a place where we have many a Waffle House, this wasn't my first experience but it was my fiancé's. However, we came this particular one because of the reviews and I must say they are a bit understaffed BUT it is what makes Waffle House what and who they are. I also noticed that they are quite unorganized to boot; which is their Achilles heel. It would be nice if they could incorporate like a headset to the cooks so that the orders aren't as rushed to the patrons and food is t running over the sides. Why? Because presentation is everything!"}
{"text":"Never again. We used to always get breakfast here on the weekends. This morning my wife called to order pick up. The waitress said, and I quote- \"You'll have to call back in 5 minutes. I'm TRYING to run a credit card.\"   Ok. Good luck with that, we will never bother you again!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here today.  Kids and wife wanted waffles, but I was watching carbs so ordered the country ham and eggs platter.  Oh man was the country ham good.  Waffles (melt in your mouth), eggs and hash browns were all very good.  Country ham was so good, kids wanted a second order of it.  The place has that close to the Interstate diner feel, but the people are nice, the food is excellent and it was clean."}
{"text":"Short wait, but not bad for a Saturday. Food tasted home made like I used to make when I cooked. Shontel was my delightful server. Nice smile and efficient. Don't come for ambiance, but do come for nice people and good simple food. Best coffee ever too."}
{"text":"With out a doubt the worst Waffle House. Customer service is absolutly worthless. Our server Vanessa was such a bitch to us, other customers and even to her coworkers. The manager Vernon was just about as useless. Will never go back to this location. If you like getting talked down to, by all means eat here."}
{"text":"This place has good food. But bad customer service. We waited 15 mins to get service. This will be the last time I come here. This fucking place is covered in FLIES!!!!! Ever heard of a fly trap? Or cleaning??!!"}
{"text":"This place looks horrible especially the kitchen area which looked greasy, wet & dirty. Foods wasn't impressed to me. Waffle was overly cooked in dark brown color & dry. Bacon came with dark color oil residue over the plate. Scrumble eggs were overly cooked as well. It doesn't serve a single star but it was not allowed. The prices doesn't worth from a resturant standard."}
{"text":"Well.... our visit started with a ten minute wait to be acknowledged, and it went downhill from there. I complained about being ignored. The nice manager apologized and asked us to stay as we were walking out. I wish we had left. Our food arrived quickly. The manager seemed eager to make up for being overlooked. But... I got a big, gross hair cooked into my eggs that I noticed when I was almost done. I felt like puking. I really don't understand how people rave about the waffles either. My son's was no better than an eggo waffle. I can do that at home, without the hair. I'll never go back. Nice manager... but horrible service. The employees were so busy chatting and visiting and whatever they were doing, they didn't notice us sit down or assumed someone else had us. Pretty crappy."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here after a particularly hard and long day. It was almost 1am and we were beat. The staff were friendly and extremely courteous. Our waitress bent over backwards, always checking on us. Brought us refills without needing to be asked and making sure our food was alright.  No this is not a Michelin star restaurant, it's an all night diner. The food is tasty and fast."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly and pleasant. I've never really have to wait for a seat... I like the bat area the most it's were all the action takes place... the food is amazing... first time I came I thought \"that's not enough food\" oh, YES it is... more than enough and at a fair price... I have made this my new breakfast spot no matter what time of the day it is ... you should come check them out if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"Dirty, dirty DIRTY!!! Floor covered in trash and food. Wont ever come back here. The waitresses were all just standing there talking to each other instead of attending customers. Waited 10 min and no one came to table. We got up and left."}
{"text":"Too many tweekers. Outside panhandling & inside hanging out. Grilled chicken was tasty, & service was OK though."}
{"text":"Good and I WILL go to this diner again. It gets its 5 stars, period. The one waitress, Tammy, is a sweetie. :)"}
{"text":"OK: several of us have gone to this Waffle House a lot over the last year so and we def like it.  The only reason it doesn't get the full 5 stars is because a few of the employees there; in particular one young skinny brunette, have no business working there. Dulce OTOH, IS good IMHO and Margo, Anita and a few of the other 'older' (age 45+) waitresses are great."}
{"text":"Went here once a few months ago and the 'vibe' was weird to say the least. There was a hell of a LOT of drama between the employees, etc. Note this was in the late morning.   The only reason I even give it 2 stars is because our waitress was decent, a 'good ol' gal' Black lady."}
{"text":"When there for to go. Staffs were nice and their food was very delicious. The only thing that disappointed me was the sanitation. I saw the lady was taking out the bacons with her bear hands and the table was sort of greasy."}
{"text":"Yes, it's Waffle House it's a diner it's old school, and this location is old BUT it is clean and well kept. It's obvious the kitchen staff work hard to keep it that way.   I went there on a break around 1pm because I had a craving for pie and Chali greeted me was so genuine and nice! All the servers were. Talkative but not too talkative, it was perfect.   The pie was good the pecan warmed is the way to go. I tried the chocolate too but it tasted more like pudding."}
{"text":"Nothing like a waffle breakfast with some eggs & hashbrowns.  The staff is always great."}
{"text":"Very surprising. Staff was very Pleasant they even knew the names of their own local patrons The cook willing and outgoing fun to deal with. The food was nice and for you liking as to order.  Clean place spacious and plenty of Windows space. A little surprising since the last time I have been to one. That was early 90's and in the Midwest. So check it out yourself. Let us know. At least The food was editable compare to the competitors on the far side. Trust me it was descent and nice and family kind of staff. Good food good people."}
{"text":"Awful! When my husband and I walked in our shoes stuck to the floor...we should have left then. It looked sketchy so we ordered something simple...waffles and eggs. The eggs came immediately, but where were our waffles? The kitchen is open so you can see everything happening. A few minutes later I saw the cook, who was coughing and sneezing, open the two waffle irons. When he opened the irons, they both stuck and he said \"shit\"! He sprayed the two other irons, but ran out of batter. Soon he had more batter and tried again. The waitress (using that turn lightly) asked how we were doing. I said my eggs are cold and I still don't have a waffle. My husband ate his eggs alone. The waitress went into the kitchen and tells him she still needs two waffles...someone else must have gotten ours while we were talking to her. So, finally I got a waffle to go with my cold eggs! Yay! Then my poor husband says \" where is my waffle? She goes over and sprays the waffle iron herself...this is so painful to write...I'm going to stop now.  Ps They didn't care how crappy the food or service was."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars for the short order cook named Young. To anyone that thinks eggs, potatoes and a protein is a simple meal...has never consistently cooked for the masses. Sounds simple but many of us have experienced sh*tty food such as this time and time again. It really isn't as easy as you'd expect or you would go home and do try to cook yourself. What I will say is Young, the uber young cook at this particular Waffle House is better than where he is at. He's got skills.  I just had a super delicious...simple but delicious breakfast that most F up!  Thank you Young for filling my all too hungry belly and proving you're better than where you're currently at but I know I'll see you in some cool ass spots.  This is just the beginning son.  Follow your dreams..you've got this. As for Nikita (the nasty, lazy server), do us all a favor and fire her. Piss poor attitude and lazy as hell. It was like a chore for her to take my order. So over people like that.  Best of luck Young!"}
{"text":"Provides everything you would expect from a Waffle House.  Interacting with the awesome staff makes a late night visit a must."}
{"text":"Best waffle house in AZ, we always stop here at least twice when we are in the area visiting. The manager Caroline is an absolute doll and made sure we were well taken care of, she is the sweetest person you will ever meet. We've gone to other Waffle Houses in AZ and the food at this one is always consistent. My mom says they are the only ones that don't make her grits all lumpy. Last time we came Caroline was a waitress, nice to see she has moved up, definitely well deserved. Can't wait for the next trip back, craving it already and we just had it before leaving town this morning."}
{"text":"Came to Waffle House with my kids to get waffles for dessert! I don't really get the food but I feel Waffle House has the best waffles! The best part is that they are cheap! I got waffles for the three of us and spend less the 12 bucks. I also get the waffles to go and they stay hot till I get home. Absolutely a place I would recommend for a waffle. I was in LA and had Roscoes waffle and I feel Waffles Houses waffles are better."}
{"text":"First time here. The most entertaining breakfast experience ever! So much going on today. Coffee machines are down, which isn't good for a breakfast place. But the repair guy is here along with a delivery in the back. These ladies don't miss a beat though, service was amazing, food was hot and delicious. They greeted every customer as they walked in the door. Thank you for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"Love the waffle house but the one baseline sucks.  We waited suck a long time ended up leaving and went to Denny's.   I would recommend not going to the one on baseline."}
{"text":"This place sucks ass. Yo floors be dirty af clean that shit up. Stop being cheap and watering down drinks, and fuck Ya mayo"}
{"text":"Had a great experience! It's always weird when you walk in and you get 13 \"good mornings\" but it's nice. We got to choose our seating and were promptly greeted. Tameka was our waitress and she was SUPER nice. She has great customer service skills. The food was delicious and cheap, definitely not healthy,but on my budget I can't care today. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Good comfort food, 24/7/365 is what this place has going for it. The $1 menu is a big plus, and beats the fast food chain versions of similar items that come microwaved & rubbery. The service here can be really bad, and there are a lot of flies in the dining area. I would come to this place more often if the staff were just more respectful. When I get an item off the $1 menu, even if I tip more than 20% I get treated in a way I feel is just rude. I have been getting some pretty obvious mistakes made on my orders too, like ordering a cheeseburger that comes out with no cheese on it, and then when I ask for cheese on my cheeseburger I have to explain what seems to me to be too simple to not understand to anyone who would actually care at all. I like the chili here too, especially on the $1 cheeseburger for 45 cents extra. Biscuits, & gravy are a little bland, but could be worse. They have the basket's of sauces available for good reason, a lot of times the food needs some real flavor. I bring a shaker of ghost peppers too that helps."}
{"text":"Need a quick breakfast fix on a limited budget?  The Waffle House may meet your needs.  The food is not great, but good enough to satisfy the \"diner cravings\".  The service was okay as well.  My gf and I each had a waffle, eggs and sausage (all just okay) but good enough fuel for our road trip."}
{"text":"The Waffle House is always good!!  But then I love waffles!  I reviewed this one only because it's where I drive to pick up my sister when she's coming to visit from Erie PA.  It's like halfway between Medina, OH, where I live, and Erie.  My brother-in-law brings her there for the \"drop-off\"!!  : ))   Everyone probably knows about Waffle House.  They are all the same.  Friendly staff that say hello to you when you come in the door and the famous large plate-sized waffle.  Of course there's other good breakfast items too.  Try the scattered potatos!  Mmmm.  Not much real healthy here : ))  Casual and cheap."}
{"text":"Good place to eat...nice waitresses and clean"}
{"text":"All you can eat special is a great buy. Food is served hot and accurately cooked to order. Service is very friendly. Nothing fancy, good comfort food better than fast food."}
{"text":"Good, not great, service. Food was average. Might be back if no other options available"}
{"text":"Good Food And Great To Go Service. I haven't dined In But We Do To Go Breakfast Often. Biscuits & Gravy & Hashbrowns All The Way Thumbs Up."}
{"text":"Prompt service. Clean. The orange juice was very fresh and tasty. Ordered 2 minutes ago a waffle with two eggs. / food arrived 6 minutes later. Very prompt. But have us grits that we didn't order and didn't ask us about options. Eggs were alright. Was given strawberry jam. My girlfriend grape jelly. Never asked us about those. Our waitress was nice so I won't disclose her name. But the service was not great. Will not come back and do NOT recommend. /finished waffle. It was not great either/"}
{"text":"The night staff was awesome food was delicious only downside was we were freezing our asses off trying to eat lol the temperature in the building was a bit low but other than that customer service was on point food was on point that's why I give them a 5 star rating"}
{"text":"Okay so I typically wouldn't review a waffle house (or denny's and chains like this) but I simply want to thank (I believe her name was Shelley sorry if it is wrong) for the outstanding Customer Service I received.    Was here a few days ago after working a 14 hour graveyard shift and locking myself out of my vehicle, I came here with my nephew to repay him for driving way over from the west valley to bring me another key to open my vehicle.  Well, being exhausted and feeling like a zombie I parked in front of WH and as I closed my door I realized I left my door key inside locking myself out yet a second time!!!  So naturally, YES I became upset and caused a bit of a SCENE, and everyone inside began to stare at me.  (hahaha only at WAFFLE HOUSE right)  After failing to get into the vehicle on a hot day I walked in and right away was greeted in a nice manner by the waitresses.  I told them what had just happened as I made my order for a blueberry and pecan waffle (which is of course amazing).  When I asked for sweet tea I was given 2 tall glasses (they knew I was THIRSTY).    I simply appreciated that they were understanding and sympathetic when they did not need to be.  Shelley also allowed me to wait and leave my vehicle (my wife returned later with another key) behind.  I am grateful there are still kind people out there who provide great CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I like the busy vibe of the place. The cheese eggs are probably the best I've had at a restaurant.. they give you the bang for your buck, too.   *side note: the strawberry waffles tastes more like a jam. Not a huge fan."}
{"text":"Great after a night out drinkin! Gets crowded but it was pretty good. I would def go back. Waffles and omelets were delish"}
{"text":"My husband and I just arrived. We haven't even received our food and already feel uncomfortable. The chef is 10 ft away talking negative about our order. Just because we don't eat eggs unless they are hard boiled. \"Who eats hard boiled eggs?\" he says. Obviously us. I love waffle house but I won't be back to this location.  #notip"}
{"text":"The food was great, but there was an employee walking around playing inappropriate music on his cell phone. It was loud enough that I could hear, and I'm sure other customers heard it too. I never caught his name but I wouldn't appreciate someone representing my company playing music like that in front of my customers. Not cool."}
{"text":"I will never come back to this Waffle House.  Not one bit about this experience has gone right."}
{"text":"I just ate there this morning and a very negative experience. Usually when you order a waffle and eggs they both come at the same time. The waffle house model is to bring you the eggs (underdog with runny egg whites, yuck!) and then the waffle shows up 5 to 7 minutes later. I don't understand, crispy is never crispy there. Anyway, I need a break from Waffle House and it's odd practices."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a trip from Chicago to NH. Our waffles and omelets were very good. The service was not what you would call great. It was extraordinary! Everyone was friendly, as they should be, but they all seemed to take care to make sure we were enjoying our time there and had enough to drink to take with us to continue our road trip. If we take this trip again, we will plan a stop here for a meal."}
{"text":"The staff was not organized! It was total chaos. We were seated but it took several minutes before getting our drinks and it took the caller many minutes to place the order with the cooks. This located is always chaotic. Management needs to make changes."}
{"text":"If all the waffle houses were run like this one, they would soon be the biggest restaurant chain in the nation.  Good version of an American standard.  You know what you are getting, and it comes with coffee and a smile."}
{"text":"Employees have no idea what is going or even what area they are working. The store manager has no idea either."}
{"text":"Great food great service need to change the cooks attitude about everything. The whole time all he did was complain about how busy he was when their was only four other customers besides me. He was rude to the servers and kept cussing about every little thing. Seriously if five customers have him this wound up what does he do on sat and sun mornings."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype about Waffle House and this location proved me right. I eat pretty healthy especially for breakfast, so this is probably why I am not as excited to eat breakfast here. However, I do eat a few things on the menu. I did not have a good experience at this Waffle House location. Service is slow. Breakfast food is probably the quickest to prepare, but it took about 20 minutes to receive our order. The food was mediocre and was not hot. I barely finished my food."}
{"text":"I went from Buffalo to Ohio to ride bicycle. On my back, I stopped with a friend to eat something. The food was awesome, but what surprise me more is that I saw the most beautiful I have seen in the last 2 years, her name was Jaclyn. Of curse I didn't even try to say \"hi\" because i'm too shy. Between the food and that girl, I'm seriously considering driving 2 hours there to eat again :) ."}
{"text":"It was a fun experience, but the coffee and food were not great. This is not fancy, just plain diner food. The servers were really a lot of fun and the experience overall was ok."}
{"text":"I've wanted to go to this location for a couple weeks but on Sunday mornings this place is PACKED, with a line out the door and wait.  I don't care how much I want a waffle, I'm not waiting in line for Waffle House.  This weekend though I got up there about 9am and it wasn't that bad, busy and full but no wait.  First thing I noticed was they had the radio cranked to 11, I had to damn near yell to the waitress.  Otherwise it was a pretty uneventful breakfast, the place is open and clean and prices aren't too far out of line.  I would recommend this place at any time other than around church time, at that point good luck getting in anywhere."}
{"text":"This waffles house is so welcoming.  The food was great.  There wasn't many people in the restaurant but people are missing out on great service  and  food. I will  make time to come back here."}
{"text":"Great friendly service, clean and the same unhealthy food that every Waffle House has. I love this place."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here every morning while I was staying at the Ramada. It never got old and our waitress was always friendly. I highly recommend purchasing one of their coffee cups for $5."}
{"text":"This place was ok until I went in the other day. The cook didn't wear gloves when grabbing my bacon from the fridge. When I complained n walked out he had the nerve to shrug his nasty shoulders and say \"oh well.\" Stay away from this location."}
{"text":"Really people ' you all must be drunk or stoned when you go here.. .Nothing special here unless you like your waitress counting change then  making your toast with out washing her hands!    dennys is on the west side of the free way , ihop 1 mile east and cracker barrel 3 miles north,, avoid this yellow dump"}
{"text":"This Waffle House location has the friendliest staff and is typically very prompt timing-wise. Personal favorite is a waffle and hashbrowns diced and peppered. Arizona is hot so the AC is on high inside, so eat your food when it gets to you or it cools fast!"}
{"text":"First time to Waffle House and we were not disappointed. Selection is basic but service was friendly and the hot and delicious was served in under 5 minutes. We were headed out of town and this place was perfect for a hot meal on the go."}
{"text":"Went there last night after 11teen beers and numerous tokes. I entered some sort of dream sequence when we were greeted and served by the sweetest eye shadow hog of a lady.   The food is always dialed. The ladies and dudes alike are always atleast baseline for a restaurant- it's Waffle House for Christ sake.  Anyway, the breakfast wizard we had last night deserves a shout but her name tag was all clapped out and faded. Keep doing your thing!"}
{"text":"horrible service!!!!! we were the only customers in the place and 3 people were working. of course 2 of them couldnt do their job due to planning their next sexcapade ( something i dont want my children hearing) the sat there for 45 min and all we got a waffle! none of the other food was cooked due to by this time a customer comig in making a togo order! ended up paying $10 for a couple drinks and a waffle! and as we were paying for the stuff we did get the waitress decided to stare everyone down and be totally rude! not sure if this is her first job or not but im sure she hasnt had many with that attitude!!! wouldnt recommend anyone going here!!! its a new place and close to home but i think ill just drive 20 min longer for good service and food!!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst waffle house I've ever gone to. We walked in there and nobody welcomed us and not to mention we were the only customers there. If i could give this place no stars I would. We decided to get up and leave because we never got a waiter to come up to us after 5 minutes of just sitting there..."}
{"text":"Jess is the best! After a long drive from the mid-west, I was hungry. She assured me my food would be very good and hot. Yes it was! Thumbs up to Jess."}
{"text":"I'd like to say a few words, both as to why I frequent this particular establishment and what your expectations of this place (and really, all places like it) should be.  First off, my wife works nights near this location. Sometimes I have to pick her up. She gets off at 5AM, we're both usually hungry and breakfast is on our minds. So that's why we have gone here so much. It's always great because pretty much nobody is around. We get fast, pleasant service and generally perfectly prepared breakfast food. What more could we ask for? Us? Nothing. This place hits the exact spot we're trying to fill.  In general, I think, people expect too much from Waffle House. You have to be able to appreciate the experience. There's always an early morning smoking crew out front, trading jokes and stories about what's going on in the world. To some people this kind of thing is off-putting. To us, it's endearing.   If you go to Waffle House expecting world-class anything you're going to be disappointed. This is more like the best the lower-middle-class has to offer: food and formica; friendly, cheap and fast. We love it and we're not ashamed to say it. This location in particular has an awesome staff. I reserve my 5-star reviews for places that I can't say anything bad about - not for places that fold my napkins when I go to the restroom."}
{"text":"Delicious food and coffee! I liked the flavor of the cream in the coffee and the waitress was a very nice lady. I would go again soon which will be this Wednesday morning cause the food is deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Right now, you can get a lot of value at this waffle house. From 2-9pm everyday, you can order off of the all you can eat menu. They make whatever you order fresh and it comes right off the grill. During that time, it's hardly anyone there (not the best breakfast time I guess). However they have burgers and breakfast sandwiches on the menu in addition to eggs and waffles. Also, dare I say it one of those things called a salad (tasted pretty fresh to me, but pretty basic). They have new staff there since March and very little turnover since March. Tell Nancy that Dom sent you and she'll take care of you."}
{"text":"Bad service even is almost empty the place is not attention to the customer you need to wait and find sit yourself and calling to clean the table, the servers only looking you without intent to service ignoring you the food is ok"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service and awesome experience!  Thanks Waffle House, I love you :D"}
{"text":"I tried straberry waffle, it was fluffy and delicious... Coffe was ok. This is comparable with a Denis (if you ask me) I Did not expect to much from this restaurant; andIi liked what was served at my table."}
{"text":"OK lunch.  Came in around 130pm for a quick bite.  Steak and eggs. Food OK. Staff seemed to occupied by sitting around to refill me drink. Oh, you also can't substitute a salad for hashbrowns with the steak and eggs  not even with an upcharge."}
{"text":"I love The Waffle House; however this is one is horrible. Our server was horrible, the cook made 1 order out of 4 orders correct. The place is full of flies, all the employees keep going 2 the back room AT THE SAME TIME. After about 30 min Of this we finally left. Still hungry. I will never go here again & I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The customer service here was excellent. Our server was so friendly.   We got our food/drinks in a timely manner. The food was good. I didn't have a waffle, but my husband did and said it was great tasting.   We will be back. :)"}
{"text":"I had never been to a Waffle House. Most have been in less than great places and screamed stay away. This one is clean and neat (mostly) and everybody said \"good morning\" or \"welcome\".  Food was better than expected and served quickly. One complaint is the waffle was not that hot and cooled off. Coffee was nice and hot tho.  Like they said in the movies \"I will be back\""}
{"text":"My all time favorite when traveling to the states. ... And its too bad they dont have those in New England. An involuntary stopover in Phoenix left us stranded here on our way to Albuquerque. But hey, a Waffle House saved our day.  Friendly people, clean and easy to get to. I will remain a waffle house fan."}
{"text":"Always a pleasurable visit. Today was the best. Miss Dee took my order, cooked it and couldn't have been kinder. A sweet woman. Thank you."}
{"text":"1/2 hour for my coffee ... Drank that 10 mins ago  I hope I get some more cheaper Before sunrise"}
{"text":"Quick and fast service. Food tastes ok. Too small of a place. Not good for a party of more than 2. Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Employees are always greeting people when they walk in and are ready to answer any questions you have.. They are open 24-hours and always seem to give pleasant customer service. Food is tasty and comes out quick!"}
{"text":"Vanessa did a great job of taking care of us.  Service was quick and food was good. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"one of the best breakfasts i've had in a while.....beats a mcdonald's and other fast food  hands down.... will definately go back"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location. The service is great and the food is also. Came on Mondays special buck 50 waffle special and it is great. Hash browns are good extra crispy. Thursday seems to be the best deal with the $5 all stars combo. I like the breakfast all star best."}
{"text":"Waffle House is always good, greasy, delicious artery-hardening food.  This Waffle House also does a good job at friendly and fast.  The food is always delicious."}
{"text":"I've been a customer of Waffle House for over 10 years. Eating at different location from Florida, Georgia, south and North Carolina. And I have to say this is the worst  Waffle House I've been to. The food was ok a lil more greasy than usual, but what was really disappointing was the service. All the employees were talking about they don't make enough money and just seemed unmotivated to work and to help each other. As customers were walking up they were saying lock the doors!! I mean no customers no jobs genius. Tables weren't  wiped and when I went to go pay the old women was so rude. The only one that was at all professional was the middle aged blonde women. There are so many places to eat in this area avoid this Waffle House location"}
{"text":"If you've not been to a Waffle House before... well... that's pretty odd, but this is a good one to start at.  Basically, they have delicious breakfast foods, and then a variety of other lunch/dinner options, but if you're at Waffle House and you're not eating breakfast, you're doing it wrong.  It's a diner, so the atmosphere is great.  Sit up at the bar and watch them prep the food and enjoy the delicious smells, or grab a booth by the window and stare out into the parking lot while you try to ignore your hangover.  The people working here are friendly, and the establishment is clean.  The food is prepared well, and delicious.  I recommend the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Eat here several times a month.  Always clean and everyone is so friendly.  Food is delicious and fast service."}
{"text":"Well I am a Waffle House connoisseur and I will eat at anyone anywhere.    This one needs a little help. THe staff was friendly but slow.    The grits were run and my hash browns were under cooked.   I had to ask for a coffee refill  Overall it's a 2.5.    But I will continue to add WF's in every city I visit"}
{"text":"Walked in by myself and got seated at the counter by a young lady, I was handed a menu and for the next 20 minutes no one acknowledged me. After one girl told another waitress \"he's been there a while I think he sat himself there\" I was then finally asked what I'd like to drink. Being that I had 20 minutes to look over the menu I was also ready to order but this lady brought me my drink and walked away. After exactly 15 more minutes of sitting there I walked out. Ironically THAT was noticed by the cook who till me to have a nice day! Ha! I laughed, drove down the street to THE GOOD EGG and I'm sitting here less than 5 minutes into this visit and I've got my order in and OJ ON THE TABLE! Needless to say, I will not be back to Waffle House."}
{"text":"I have read the reviews and mostly it's a timing thing with restaurants..  I must have timed it right because I had a great experience. About 5 p.m. on a Tuesday evening.  I have learned not to totally judge a place on one visit.  Everyone has a bad day.  If you have not had a steak from Waffle House you are missing out.  I had the T-bone and when compared to places like Denny's and the like this is a  very good cut of meat and they cook it the way you want.  I am a medium rare guy and that's what I got along with a huge side salad, with Texas toast and hash browns.  (The hash browns were a little dry but still tasty)  Jennifer was terrific handling my order.  Very friendly and attentive.  I definitely recommend this place and will return on my next visit to the area, which is about once a month."}
{"text":"Disgusting, waffle irons filthy,floors fillfy, paid for my coffee, and left"}
{"text":"Just walked out of the store, FILTHY 15 employees , they didn't acknowledge us, three employees were out front blowing bubbles ,literally.  I called the number to report the store and the manager flat blew us off.  Did I say it was FILTHY!"}
{"text":"What the heck?  Why are there so many of these around and people eating at these places.  Was it me? I've these these places a few times and this by far is the worst breakfast place I have ever tried.  REALLY! First, it took a while to be seated because they had customers.  So I thought, ok the food has to be good. Next, we placed the order and it took about 45 minutes to get my food.  SERIOUS!  I had enough time to count the tables and chairs on the counters and they had 8 tables, and about 12 spots on the counter, I say around because they squeezed them in.  So let's say they are filled to capacity: 4x8tables = 32, plus the 12 counter spots = 42  I guess you have to wait a minute per person. I've been to busier IHOPS, Denny's and other breakfast places that have been food and faster service that this place.  They have employees serving other employees drinks because of the tight quarters, yelling the orders only when the cook is willing and ready to listen.  Am I missing something here? OK, so when I FINALLY got my food, the eggs were cold, the hash-browns were burnt on one side, of course they hid the burnt side on the bottom, and when I said I ordered grits, they said they ran out and replaced them hash-browns.  WHAT?!  Ran out of grits! The waffles were ok, nothing to write home about, but in reality, this place is horrible!!!!! Would not even mention this to my enemies....well maybe."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Friendly waitresses. What more could you want. Drop by and tell them I sent ya."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at a Waffle House. This place is a DIVE. No rating posted. And extremely DIRTY. The quality of food is poor. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I can give a half star for being open."}
{"text":"please never eat there! the staff are very unprofessional, there were screaming and yelling and  two employees walked out the back in order to fight! i'm not make this up! save your money and make a good investment by going somewhere else"}
{"text":"oh waffle house gods in the sky. thank you for arranging the stars so the good egg had a wait. i know your feelings may have been hurt because a certain someone didn't have her heart set on partaking in a meal at your restaurant.   but i love you, even though the tables are gnarly, the silverware is kinda clean, the floor is not to be made eye contact with and it is advisable to drink your beverage with a straw. and we with the help from the wait gods got three more waffle house converts out of a meal.   our server was fantastic. she apologized because they were short staffed yet she was accommodating in every way. she exceeded all of our waffle house expectations. we had a little bit of everything and you can't go wrong with anything. get the hash browns all the way - it's a style, not a request. the burgers are good diner burgers too.   y'all it's not a high class place. it's cheesy greasy, tasty and cheap. but it's f*(king delicious! and CA needs to get one."}
{"text":"Back in the day, when I used to travel all over the country, I would look forward to my visits to the south. Warmth and sunshine in the winter .... fantastic BBQ ... and Waffle House. I made it a point to stop in at least once per visit for breakfast. Now they've expanded and one is even located not that far from my home. So, before I voted today, I decided to treat myself to a Waffle House breakfast. Of course, their breakfast is served all day long, so matter what time you wake up they'll be waiting for you.  They still look the same, inside and out. I grabbed a seat at the counter and checked out the place mat/menu. My eyes immediately went to the All Star Breakfast. Get this: for under $10.00, including tax, I had coffee, a waffle, two eggs (over easy), toast, hash browns and three slices of bacon. And since they cook everything in front of you, you know everything is fresh. The eggs were nice and runny, perfect for slopping up with the toast. Bacon, cooked under that metal press thing they use, was crisp, as were the hash browns. I would have preferred the waffle been left in the maker a bit longer to crisp the outsides up some more. But, after smothering it in butter and syrup, I was happy. Just like old times!  I noticed other reviewers complained about the service, but I couldn't have been more pleased with it. They were attentive and friendly (refilled my coffee cup twice), and checked in on me numerous times. Maybe I was lucky, or maybe there is a new attitude there, but I thought the service was fine."}
{"text":"I ordered some hash browns (smothered covered and chunked) and they gave me some digestion issues.  They're normally very good but the last two times i've gone I felt sick the day after eating here.  Try a different one maybe?"}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome! Everything came out perfect. I'm in love with the blonde headed glasses wearing cook.. (not relevant) marry me?"}
{"text":"This place is great for what it is.  The service is quick and friendly, and the food is inexpensive.  The All-Star special is a good deal and you get eggs, toast, grits, a waffle, and bacon for $7.95.  If you are looking for a quick breakfast, this is a great option!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food.  The employees are courteous and the service is fast.  The portions are good for the price and the small dinner feel is great to eat in.  I have gone here many times with my disabled brother and have never had any problems with the staff or employees.  I also like the fact that they are one of the few 24 hr restaurants available to eat at and this has come in handy many times."}
{"text":"This place blows! Fuckin dummy ass kids. I do understand that you wanna go for a smoke but should at least take my order before you go out and do just that. Service was garbage. Took forever. So I called from my table and ordered my food over phone. Was way faster. And then the girl expected a tip?! Like wtf so NOT happening. ... The food tho after the long ass wait was amazing!"}
{"text":"We visit this Waffle House often and enjoy it.  Staff are friendly & engaging.  Food is good.  Lots of locals & regulars."}
{"text":"This wasn't our usual WH, but we decided to give it a try since we were in the area. I ordered a chicken melt and it appeared to take a long time to prepare. When I asked someone to check on it, a cook came over and asked questions about it, such as did I want onions or the bread toasted or grilled. I order this whenever I go to WH and have never been asked such specifics. I wasn't sure how the bread is usually prepared, so I said I just wanted it however it is usually done. She proceeded to blame the waitress, stating it was her third day. My husband spoke up and said it wasn't a problem with the waitress. It was a simple order of a chicken melt. (I did not ask that anything special be done to it.) The chicken melt did not taste as good as the ones I'm accustomed to getting at WH. No surprise with all the initial questions.  Anyway, when we got our bill, there was a note that the order was taken wrong and and the customer had to wait a long time. This is unfair to R. who'd simply put in for a chicken melt. It is not her fault the cooks did not know how to prepare it. Even if that was the case, it was not necessary to attempt to make her look bad. If they did not understand the order, someone should have come to our table sooner to ask for clarification. Instead, we sat for a long time wondering what could be taking so long.   All in all, the young lady did an outstanding job. She provided good service by bringing our meals as soon as they were ready, refilling our waters, and clearing the plates as they were emptied. We'll be going to our mainstay WH from now on."}
{"text":"Hadn't been the House in a very long time...was craving some potatoes and they're the place for some seriously good greasy fried potatoes! Ordered sausage egg and cheese sandwich, would have preferred the egg over medium but my fault for not asking. Really just looking for something to order aside the potatoes. The sausage was excellent. Potatoes scattered(not in the ring) smothered(with onion) and peppered (jalapenos) well (extra crispy) were just what I was looking for.  Head server was so patient and kind to the staff of mostly newbies running around the place she really was something special. Sunday morning rush and she was a cool cucumber telling everyone were to be and what to do so that it all ran smoothly. And of course it's always fun to watch the cooks handle the griddle with flair.  Looking for a good n' greasy, clean, truck stop breakfast with friendly staff this is your place."}
{"text":"Shit was gross I ordered chopped steak and they brought me fuckn hamburger meat..I Know wut chopped steak taste like biitches..ill Neva go back food was wack..my wife ordered strawberry waffles expecting strawberries on the wafflelz..nope!! They frozen waffles..I'm so pissed I had to leave there and go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"I took my 10 year old grandson to the Waffle House thinking it was the same as the Waffle Shop in California. Dont make the same mistake I did, they are not even close to the same! I ordered eggs and porkchops and my grandson ordered a chicken biscuit. The eggs were runny the porkchops were raw in the middle and it took half an hour to get the raw porkchops! I was really disappointed when my grandson got his meal ( Chicken biscuit ) and he looked at me and said \" This tastes like a TROUT BISCUIT.\"Not sure what exactly it was but my grandson wouldnt eat it and neither would I. They offered to recook my porkchops but when I smelled the grease and saw the old waflle batter hanging off the counter, I wasnt gonna take any chances. After that, WE LEFT."}
{"text":"Decent, fast, cook to order food.  Typical waffle house.  Truck Driver friendly and 10% off if you show your Carrowinds Season pass."}
{"text":"We walked in to a big hello. Two guys helped with the doors as we had 3 large suitcases. Friendly and great personality of waitresses everyone in a good mood. I had the grilled chicken biscuit.YUM jack had the omelet and the best hashbrowns yet. Great place. Cheap. Good coffee too."}
{"text":"Food was good and had really good prices. Service was the worst. We sat for more than 20 minutes at the counter before we even got utensils. The people sitting right next to us got their food ate and left before we were even acknowledged. When we finally got their attention the server was rude and stated with attitude and annoyance as to why we didn't say anything when clearly we were waiting on being served while multiple servers just stared at our empty counter without once offering anything not even to double check if we had already been helped. Because of the service we received I would have rather waited outside for a table at IHOP."}

A common joke that my wife and I share when we go out for a special high-end dinner is what appetizers will I prepare at home before we leave just in case we are disappointed $100 later.  Well I was on a \"Daddy Daughter Date,\" with my 14 year old and wound up at this waffle house.  Needless to say I was skeptical, the place was virtually empty yet the server was friendly and the place was clean.  Looking at the menu I thought the prices were a bit high for a restaurant of this caliber, but I feel that any sub-par food is over priced.  My daughter, who would have rather been at McDonald's, ordered a plain cheeseburger ($3.25) without the hash browns (they don't serve FF), and I ordered something like a Philly steak melt ($7.65).  Initially I was looking at a sliced steak sandwich but when I asked the server if it was good she said yes but most people like the Philly steak melt better.  I appreciated that as I didn't feel like chewing too much--my teeth hurt.  I was still skeptical but I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the cook who came from outside the building to cook, but meticulously washed his hands first.  It told me that this man was serious about his craft.  Then a wonderful thing happened.  The cook felt that I would be missing out if I didn't have sautéed mushrooms on my sandwich and suggested it.  Yes, I said, yes. The food took a bit to get to us (about 10 mins), but even that was comforting, as I knew that much care was going into this preparation.  We got the food and to my amazement every morsel was magnificent.  I cleaned my plate.  Even my daughter denounced McDonald's as the king of the burger and asked when I will return with her.  \"Daddy Daughter Day,\" was a huge success and I believe in flavor outside of the home again."}
{"text":"It's a cheap diner, what do you expect? Didn't expect service to be so horrible. Like, sorry our group of 10 ruined your fun of sitting around doing nothing on a Sunday. Guess they were used to no one coming in at all, and it was quite an inconvenience for them.  Jon especially.  Yeah, obviously 10 people is a little difficult for seating, and a large party can be a bit overwhelming... but god damn it Jon you could have been A LOT better...or the very least put in some effort. Jon, and then the cook, and some other server. Would have at least expected the other server to help him out and cover half of the group instead of awkwardly mopping under our booths and feet.  Personally got a BLT and some hashbrowns. Doesn't a BLT come with mayo?!?! It's to be expecting right? Right! Well I didn't get any, let alone the drinks we all ordered, so Jon had to he reminded. Is that standard operating procedure? To not get ANY drink at all until you get your food? If I hadn't said anything I probly would have been charged for a drink I NEVER got, wouldn't have been happy about that.  Anyways, the nonexistent mayo for a BLT came in the form of Heinz squeeze packets. It was an ok BLT for the most part. People's burgers seemed from frozen and thawed at some point during the day...no thanks. Liked the hashbrowns with the grilled onions though, was gonna get more, but, Jon probly would have forgot that to.  Other than shit service I really didn't expect, oh and Jon texting on his phone...yes Jon you were that noticeable behind the register!! How about focusing on the needs of your damn 3 tables you selfishly got all for yourself instead of poorly sneaking a text!....sorry, I digress...my respect to the cook though, handled everything like a pro and everything was accurate and came out pretty timely. If anyone deserves whatever tip was given its the cook. If Jon had any self respect he would give ALL of it to the cook and get NOTHING. Ass.  Glad it's too far away from me to worry about coming to again, because its really not worth the trip on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and my husband and I enjoy eating at Waffle House but unfortunately the last time we ate there (Wednesday, November 30) the outside of the restaurant had trash all over the place and the inside was not quite clean either.  Food and service was as good as usual but with 3-4 people standing around just talking seems like the trash, at least on floor inside, good have been cleaned up."}
{"text":"I love this place and take the kids there a lot of mornings before school. Always fresh, the servers there are polite and caring. They remember our names and what the kids want to drink. We have our favorites of course but there is no bad choice when it comes to service or the food. Pretty cool to have such a good example of what I wish the rest of the nations Waffle House chain was doing. Best so far and gained my business on a weekly basis to be more precise. Great food anytime of the day as well, not just breakfast but dinner once a month I suppose. Go Tempe Waffle House. 5 stars well deserved."}
{"text":"Traveling through town and stopped for breakfast. We're familiar with Waffle House, but this is the best one we've been to in a long time. The food was quality, hot and fresh, and the staff was so personable, attentive, and our drinks were never empty, even though there wasn't an empty table in the place. They kept calling customers by name as well, which I love. Made the start to our long morning drive a good one."}
{"text":"We came to this location after walking out on the location at IKEA. The staff here was so friendly and attentive and the store was gleaming. The food was the usual waffle house menu but I discovered something today: they have three different menus. If you don't see what you want on the menu you get, asked the staff for it.   My go-to breakfast is cheese omelette, raisin toast and grits."}
{"text":"We walked out without eating. They must have just had a rush because every single table and placesetting was dirty. There were a lot of flies. But the final straw was the crowd of ants on old food on the floor under our table. Ugh.   We went over to the location on WT Harris close to Statesville Road, and there was a world of difference! Clean store, friendly staff, and a good breakfast. I hope the Tryon store cleans up their act before the blue line goes in!"}
{"text":"Standard Waffle House grub BUT 4 stars was for the great service. Quick and friendly from the servers to the guy making the waffles."}
{"text":"\"B\" cleanliness rating ......  Never a good sign.  Waffles looked deceased and greasy food , complaining employees.....  If you wear a cowboy hat, enjoy the smell of manure and cocoa butter, this is your joint. Yuck They get one star for the location and the coffee is okay."}
{"text":"Damn they make some good food. The service was also pleasant and friendly. They are very helpful even with the most custom orders."}
{"text":"First time going to a Waffle House with my best friend. Didn't expect much because there was no people inside but it was the afternoon. The food was good and the music was great. The waiter was super nice!"}
{"text":"Its 2:45 am, after having a few drinks with friends needed to get something in the stomach and decided to stop at Waffle House. This fills the void of limited eating options late night /early morning and most of the patrons here at this hour have the same need. Basic service, cookie cutter drab atmosphere with florescent lighting, and basic food but definitely fills a late night niche."}
{"text":"KidS love place. Waffle is best choices   But severs is slow and not nice.take long time for asking to go box"}
{"text":"Overall great service. Waitress was very friendly and polite. The food is always good. A little under staffed for a holiday."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service ever at a Waffle House. Seems like a bunch of kids working. They are just messing around and talking while customers are in store. They messed up my order. I got part of it and then had to wait for the rest of it."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for breakfast and I'm questioning whether to give them another chance.  It was a weekday mid morning and about 8 customers.  The \"manager\" was sitting at the counter reading a newspaper when all of a sudden she screams \"I'M GOING TO BUY A PUPPY!\".  One of the other girls working asked her what she said and she continued to scream over and over about getting a dog.  I certainly didn't expect a quiet experience but I sure as hell didn't expect to hear an employee, much less a manager to be screaming at the top of her lungs.  You can't enjoy breakfast when someone is screaming like a banshee."}
{"text":"This is the beat Waffle House that I have ever been to. They even fix my son's first so that it is cool when it gets to the table. Not many places will let a 10 month old's meal cool before it comes to the table. Love it! Great food and everyone who works there makes you feel at home too."}
{"text":"Second visit within past two months.  Great food.  Can't go wrong with the all star.  Both times came in with large group.  Same waitress both times (TJ).  Very fast, very friendly, very impressed.  Extra star in my review for the service"}
{"text":"Left coyote joes , came here , great service.  Fast service and friendly folks.  Our waitress was Dee! She did an amazing job. The whole restaurant was singing country a country song, staff was record out ! To funny. They are blessed with patience because most of us were drunk."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the courteous staff and excellent service. My wife and I were traveling through early and glad we stopped here.  Food was wonderful and cook even stopped by to offer his service."}
{"text":"We ended up here for several reasons. They were pretty much the only place open, we love to eat here and we had just left a comedy show featuring Kevonstage and he always talks about how this is his spot despite the staff and cleanliness. Check out the video he did on this place, hysterical.  And of course, just ask Uncle Google and he will locate it for you. So we sat ourselves and I have to say that it was a bit chilly inside which was a bummer but we were greeted very kindly and attended to in a way that we rarely find at a Waffle House. Score for the staff. They were amazing. We ordered our food, me a cheesesteak hash brown bowl with raw onions instead of grilled and I added an over easy egg to go on top. My hubby had a cheesesteak omelet, grits, a biscuit and a waffle.  Our food came out in a timely manner, she forgot the waffle but it was made quickly and though I've seen prettier waffles, it was still tasty. His grits were also lukewarm, which I didn't get because grits should always be piping hot.   My order was good with the exception of two minor but could be major things. My over easy egg whites weren't all cooked.  You have to know how to do over easy eggs where the white is fully cooked and the yolk is still runny. Thankfully my hash browns and steak were hot so I just stirred it all up to \"cook\" the part that was undone. It worked.  Secondly, the raw onions I asked for instead of the grilled that comes with it, were very chunky. Like whoever was on onion chopping duty was having an off day. I love raw onions so the chunkiness didn't take me down.  As is standard in many Waffle House restaurants, it was in need of a good sand blasting, bleach filled cleaning.  I noticed the 93 score on the wall, but like Kevonstage says, you go into a Waffle House knowing exactly what you're getting in to. Will I return? Yup! That is all!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here.. my food is fast and perfectly cooked! The guy that cooks (I'm pretty sure he's the only guy there and is there every time) is always on point with everything and is a great multitasker from what I saw so no wonder my food is always fast."}
{"text":"Waffle House continues to not disappoint. The quaint establishment has great options for any time of the day. I definitely recommend the Texas bacon cheesesteak melt plate."}
{"text":"We visited Medina's Waffle House on a Sunday morning and found the place bright and busy. We were greeted aloud by happy staff from behind the counter and invited to sit anywhere. The general feel is one of a vintage diner and the music playing added to that impression. We found our booth and in short order were met by our friendly server. Ordering from the laminated placemat/menus: one waffle, one order hash browns with onions. Our table and surroundings were clean and neat, napkin-wrapped flatware was clean. Our orders arrived promptly. The waffle was good in flavor but could have used another minute cooking time -- others' waffles looked the same: a bit too blond -- but acceptable. The hash browns were done well: browned areas, tender portions, not too greasy, and the onions were lightly sautéed. This was our first visit to a Waffle House but it won't be our last. One thing took us aback a bit... with the name Waffle House, why is the waffle selection on the menu so limited?"}
{"text":"Came in at 11, 8 people on staff, 1 customer in.  Women complaining loudly about whoever was supposed to be on dish pit and what is or isn't their job. Super tacky and uncomfortable.  My waitress took my order, went and called it out to an older lady who was on grill.  This older lady had absolutely no sense of urgency, and I watched my waitress make at least half of my order while other lady was getting confused between my order and the order of one other customer.  I watched other employees leaning hard like they were keeping the walls up.  I kept thinking about how much money waffle house was losing having 8 people on staff on a Thursday 11 am...... The manager and my waitress were the only people I saw doing anything besides ol complainy asking my waitress to get her ice water because she had worked up such a thirst cooking a couple of liquid eggs, hash browns and toast.   Food was decent, regular breakfast food.  I did not like the kraft single slice on top of my grits.  I asked for cheese but didn't realize that's what they were working with. Thank you Amber, for taking care of me, and I hope they pay you enough to work there.  I can only imagine what kind of shit show it is when you guys actually get busy.  I would also like to note that I heard Amber politely coaching other girls on how to read tickets or make things."}
{"text":"the worst waffle house i've ever been to.  the waitress picked butter up from the floor, put it on our table and didnt wash her hands.  there was a piece of hair in my food which really grossed me out.  the waitress was guzzling down some energy drink between customers which was also gross.  i ordered a vanilla coke & was instructed to mix it up because it probably wasn't good.  it was so gross the amount of syrup in the drink.  it was mostly vanilla with a little bit of coke flavor.  it was dirty and gross.  also wreaked havoc on my insides probably as a result of the cleanliness."}
{"text":"we were in phoenix for the weekend from Los Angeles. this location was convenientley close to our hotel room so we decided to check it out. The hostess was very friendly and our server was too nice, almost as if he was on a good one.  The place itself inside doesnt look very attractive and you would think you walked into a trailer trash type of location. but dont let that fool you, the food was great! we had waffles (of course) eggs, melts and we loved it all. the service was fantastic. it was crowded when wer were there and noisy but we cared more about having breakfast and getting on with our day. We will definatley check this place out next time were in town"}
{"text":"I love this place! Its so awesome to go to a place that has the taste u remember as a kid.  If I could afford it, I would eat all 3 of my daily meals here. Thats not to say there prices are high, because they are not.  Another nice thing is that there menu is the same as when I was a child, and there is something comforting in knowing that."}
{"text":"Good service. Excellent value. I went for the \"All You Can Eat\" deal they have from 2-9 PM and was there for a few hours. I'm not fat or anything, I just felt like finding a good place to study and eat for a bit. The server was pretty attentive and the kitchen staff was pretty fast. I was kind of disappointed that the menu for the all you can eat deal was missing many of my favorites from the regular menu, but there were still quite a few good choices."}
{"text":"Its the Waffle house, friendly people and decent food. Food is usually good enough for someone who loves a quick simple breakfast and some mediocre coffee. I can't complain for my most recent tab of $6.44 before tip. It's the Waffle House there is a billion of these things across the South and East for a reason. Just don't go the one in Covington, KY. That one is nasssstyy.... Oh and I have never had a waffle from a Waffle House so couldn't tell you."}
{"text":"Lots of attitude from the workers, when I asked to cancel one of my orders they haven't even made yet 30 minutes after I had already ordered, they rolled their eyes and sighed. Not only rude but takes forever to take orders when the restaurant wasn't even busy. I recommend going to a different location."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service with a smile from all the employees---even on a SUPER busy Sunday late morning RUSH time!! Good Waffle House food :) our server was Jeremiah and he was excellent!!! :)"}
{"text":"The waffles and food were very delicious and I was impressed with the pricing. The only reason why I am giving three stars is because of the service from our waitress. Bre looked like she didn't want to be there and not once did she smile. I guess she is not a people person per say, and to me, customer service and a smile goes a very long way!"}
{"text":"Our food, once we got it, was good.  Our server was new and a very hard worker. The problem was that she was doing everything but wait on us. She was washing dishes, drying dishes, sweeping the floor, etc. She brought us half of our meals (eggs, toast and hashbrowns) and when she finally came back, she asked us if we needed anything else. When I responded that we wanted the rest of our orders (waffles and sausage), she looked puzzled. It took us well over an hour to finish our meals. Our \"iced\" teas were not iced, even after we requested ice several times. There were other issues with our orders that I won't go into. I blame all of this less on our server and more on management. You don't put a new server out waiting tables on a very busy Sunday morning and then make her do all of those other jobs."}
{"text":"nice and clean location. there is a lot of people working in here. maybe shift turn over. the food was served pretty fast and the waffle was cooked perfect nice and crispy shell and moist inside."}
{"text":"I believe this was the best waffle house I've ever been to. Speedy service and the 2 cooks....(had to pause) omg food was great and the coffee was on point  (great as well)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at quite a few waffle houses in my day, so I know not to expect much. They're usually pretty good and this one was about the same. BUT I was VERY disappointed at the service at this place. It took almost 5 minutes just for someone to get our drink order(the place was not busy) and the table was still dirty from the previous customers. I saw 2 employees on their cell phones while cooking food. Another employee was actually walking around talking on her cellphone while working. But the one thing that got me, was seeing 3 employees drinking beverages around the food. One server kept her coffee cup on the tray that held the syrup(which was right by our table). Another server had his on the counter near the stove. And another had hers near the coffee machines and I saw them quite frequently drinking from them. I know this isn't the grandest place the eat, but I was expecting a bit more than how I saw the employees behaving..."}
{"text":"I wouldnt drive all the way from reno and not give it 5 stars. Ive been to the waffle houses in the midwest and south and i am a fan. I miss waffle house since moving to reno and this is the closest to us so guess what we drove here. There arent any places whose waffles even come close. I love the warm syrup and everything is cooked fresh. This place is definitely worth driving to and will be an annual vacation favorite."}
{"text":"Ehhh. Ordered chocolate chip pancakes. I got pancakes with chocolate chips sprinkled on (not melted)   And we made a new friend that crawled across the table smh. Dissapointed me today waffle house"}
{"text":"Waffle House, I can't give you five stars for awesomeness, but you deserve at least a couple stars for being open 24 hours and feeding a hungry girl with a late night craving of waffles and eggs.  This place is the typical diner fare, but for a fraction of the price.  Don't expect haute cuisine.... but you'll be happy with the cheap eats and friendly service."}
{"text":"Funny staff. Quick service. Cheap food. Clean-ish. They're not trying too hard and that's what I like some diners to do."}
{"text":"I have never had bad service at Waffle house until yesterday at this location. It started with us having to ASK for coffee not being offered a drink when we sat down not even water. Then we had to ASK for refills  twice once when a manger(who was very nice) asked us how our food was. We asked if we could get more coffee our waitress heard us ask and with a look of disgust brought it to us and were ignored by her only food came (which was lukewarm at best.."}
{"text":"If you're going to have a exposed kitchen area I would suggest you have employees properly trained on safe food handling. I watched a cook use a food catch to compact trash and then proceed to touch food on the line. She did not change her gloves or wash her hands. This is how food illness outbreaks occur. Hopefully my cheap meal does not turn into a expensive hospital bill."}
{"text":"Just a good ol' American breakfast with hearty portions and good presentation - not to mention delicious!  Love the hash browns with grilled onions ... oh so GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Waffle House food is always delicious in my opinion. However, this was the dirtiest location I had ever been to. It was 11:30pm on a Friday night. There was a total of 4 tables occupied. 5 employees that I had seen and there was 1 that was working non-stop. Our waitress worked so hard on acting busy. Ridiculous. Another woman served us and had to resubmit missing orders. Restaurant is dead on business and no one could pick up a rag and clean up dirty tables, clean the disgusting floor or clean the bathroom which had a toilet covered in feces. Just horrible. Blame the workers? Sure. Where the hell is management?"}
{"text":"First-ever trip to Waffle House a success!  Despite frequent travels across the Midwest and Southeast, never had the urge to pull off into the 24-hour staple of franchised cooking.  This came to an end in Willoughby, Ohio.  Ordered the pecan waffle along with a large side of hash browns done smothered (with onions), and chunked (and ham).  Food emerged promptly, and I was actually impressed.  Waffles was Eggo thin (no odes to Brussels or Liege here), but were nevertheless crunchy on the surface with a hint of soft on the inside.  Batter evoked the smell of sweet vanilla cream; probably intended.  With butter and Aunt Jemima-style syrup, overall very satisfying.  As were the shredded hash brown, which was served just a bit crunchy.  Reasonably clean overall, but noted leaky syrup bottles left sticky rings on everything it contacted.  Including my elbows.  Will return."}
{"text":"Breakfast...good fast cheap. I like sitting at the bar so i can watch the staff cook all the plates. Thats another feature i like watching them cook and work in the open. Dani is an awesome server with a dry wit...don't get butthurt ok"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!! My husband and I wanted some good breakfast there were some mixed reviews on this place, so we decided to try it... I sat down and ordered the Strawberry Waffle and bacon, my husband ordered the chopped Steak and eggs... My SO-Called strawberry waffle came with NO strawberries and the bacon was thin as paper. I asked where my strawberries were to put on the top of my waffle and she said they were inside my waffle... MY WAFFLE LOOKED LIKE A BIG STRAWBERRY EGGO BUT FLATTER THAN A PANCAKE. To top it off my Husband got his SO-called chop steak and eggs...LMAO they brought him a fried HAMBURGER Patty dripping in grease! Sent it back, left and went to mcdonalds.... WAFFLE HOUSE MY ASS!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy waffles, quick, friendly service and a simple and inexpensive menu..... what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Late night waffles and other breakfast foods at an affordable price.  Worthwhile if aren't afraid to dine next to big scary bald men with tattoos on their head.  Mostly friendly servers, plus it's nice to see them make your food."}
{"text":"We walked in and no \"hi\" or \"good morning\"Sandrah looked at us at least 3 times and never said anything...didn't even say someone will be right with you..finally a guy came and said how we were doing and be right with us..he didn't come back a oriental young lady helped us about 10 minutes later because she asked if we had been helped..talk about customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Waffle House. My waistline does not. But for once in a while it is just damn good stuff. Luckily it just when I am on the road."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first ever visit to a Waffle House restaurant.   Tons of food for the money. I ate an All-Star Breakfast Special and added a biscuit with gravy on the side.   While the grits were swimming in margarine/oil and were therefore not nearly as good as they could have been, the rest of the meal--waffle, toast, eggs, sausage, biscuit & gravy, hot chocolate--was great.   The standout of the visit, though, was the waitress. She was mid-way through a split double shift and exceptionally kind, attentive, patient, and seemed genuinely concerned we have the best dining experience possible.   I will be back. Thank you, Waffle House!  EDIT: We both came down with viral pneumonia. The waitress was still infectious despite her claim to the contrary. -2 stars and I won't return. If a chain pushes it's staff so close to the line that they must work while terribly sick, don't give them business. If a staff member chooses on their own to put the public at risk, don't go back."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice with my  friend,  the first time coming  here i got the chocolate chip waffle,  which in have to say was good. For just one waffle, i was content, the flavors were good and neither were over powering the other . The employees were also very friendly, i got the same experience the second time coming here. This time, my friend  and i got the triple hash browns all the way, which is basically with everything on it. It was enough for two people to share, you would think just pileling everything on it would be gross, it actually wasn't bad. Like i said before with the waffle, everything was balanced, this place has a good habit of succeeding in that. This place is great and i recommend it"}
{"text":"We haven't been to a Waffle House in years. We stopped for breakfast today. Very friendly service. We were served the fastest we've had in a long time! Food was exactly as ordered and hot when it was brought to our table. Friendly service, good food served hot, and the the way you order it! We will be repeat customers! Thank you WH! :) Pecan waffle with the big breakfast Yummy!"}
{"text":"the 1st place we have never been to that are meals came hot straight from the kitchen!! damn!! never been here before..  order the super plate(I think that's what it's called) the average plate is $7.50 it's right next to the 17fwy  can't miss it ..."}
{"text":"Visiting for the spring training games and waitresses we're very rude very snappy like my family and I were inconvenience."}
{"text":"Service was so friendly and the food was ready so quick! We stopped in for breakfast and it was delicious. Couldn't be more happy with our experience!   11/10 would visit this location again!"}
{"text":"I'm officially grossed out. Not only is there decaying food spilled all over the kitchen counters & floor, which is in plain sight as you walk in, but the flies in this place are out of control! This was my 2nd time here & I got sat in the \"fly corner\" by the exit door. It was swarming with flies that were crawling all over the window behind me, the table I was supposed to be eating at, & hovering over & around me. Needless to say, that is NOT very appetizing.   \"A fly infestation poses a serious hygiene risk. Unfortunately, flies are attracted to conditions found in restaurants, where they can do the most damage. Flies are known to carry numerous diseases, including tuberculosis, typhoid and cholera. Flies feed on decaying organic waste, and then transfer pathogens from their feet to human food and food preparation surfaces.\" -via Orkin website  I hope management does something about this as it poses a health risk for its customers & creates a very unappealing atmosphere. I don't understand how the health inspector missed this place.   There's a difference between a clean dive/hole in the wall spot with GREAT food & a dirty/hole in the wall restaurant with mediocre food.  You be the judge...or just save yourself a trip & your money."}
{"text":"Oh no no no !!!  never going there Ahh! or any Waffle House.....  I went with my wife to try it out , it looked if we went back to the 50's . The kitchen was so dirty, only two people working there the Cook and the Waitress. I order the Waffle , it took 20 minutes to be done, while waiting in the back room the waitress was smoking where all the food is stored.. I was like wait a minute, the cook called her for my waffle , then she tells me is the waffle brown enough touching it with her hands ...  this is a Twilight Zone Moment ... sorry , but never and ever stepping in a Wackala House !!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Awesome friendly staff. Quick too. Got our food to go.  Also they have an epic way of ordering hashbrowns. Options like \"peppered(jalapeños)\", \"smothered(chili)\" and others. So when you order it comes out something like  \" Covered, smothered, peppered and capped\"  Gave us a smile!"}
{"text":"Service was fine and I've been in some nasty waffle houses but lord, I just tried to wet nap my whole body in the car.  Mostly from grabbing the Tabasco.  Oh and the salt and pepper and then my napkin was stuck to the table. It was really pretty comical cause my sleeve was in turn, stuck to the menu.  I actually ate the food against my better judgement because I was starving. I understand they are busy and it was lunch time but there's really no excuse. And I just noticed I sat in something in the booth. Oh God."}
{"text":"Just terrible.  No greeting.  Took forever to get coffee.  Took forever to get eggs and toast.  Took forever to get the waffle.  Did I mention I was the only customer in the restaurant.  The staff was the epitome of lazy.  And they were lazy right in front of the district manager who was clearing out the cash drawer.  The waffle batter was not mixed properly and there were dry lumps in my waffle.  Eggs were overcooked.  Toast was good.  Weird whispering and snickering by the two lazy workers.  This place needs an employee and management enema.  Will never be back."}
{"text":"If you want to know how much I liked this experience, I gave a $25 tip on a $35 bill.   Monika (I believe that was her name) is the sweetest most attentive server I have seen in a long time. Absolutely delightful and made sure we were cared for with refills, cleaning up quickly, a happy attitude and fast. I cannot say enough good things about her.  But that's not enough... I am lucky to compare one Waffle House to another in Tennessee that I went to. Complete opposites. This one was clean...even the usual sticky syrup containers were clean! We sat at the counter so we could see the floor, the storage, the \"back of the counter\" areas and they were spotless.   So if you get that waffle house craving this is the one to drive to."}
{"text":"A friend of mine was employed there and she was regularly sexually harassed by customers. The management did nothing. She had to resign. Sad... must be a sign of the times..."}
{"text":"In reading the other reviews on the food, I was somewhat hesitant on dining here.  I am glad that we took a chance, as all the staff were friendly and warm.   They appeared to enjoy their time at work and consequently their interactions with customers were sincere and greatly appreciated by my family and I.  In terms of the quality of food, it was okay for the price.  I wouldn't and shouldn't expect a 5 star dining experience or high quality food when the average cost is about $7 per person."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to AZ from the Chicago area for 5 days. We stopped at this Waffle House on our 2nd or 3rd day for breakfast, and our last day in AZ for breakfast.  We had the same waitress, Tosha, both times. She remembered our orders, she is so friendly, and had us smiling the entire time.  The rest of the staff does a fantastic job as well. It had gotten quite busy and their teamwork was phenomenal.  I have to say,  without a doubt,  my first time at a Waffle House was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Waffle House may not be the most \"healthiest\" option but I LOVE going there. The staff at every store is friendly, the food is freshly cooked. I love the hashbrowns and the Grits. The fact that they are open 24/7 is good for when I am out and need a quick meal.   Tip  IF there is a storm or bad weather in the area and you have a waffle house they have a index  The Index has three levels, based on the extent of operations and service at the restaurant following a storm:[3]  Green: the restaurant is serving a full menu, indicating the restaurant has power and damage is limited. Yellow: the restaurant is serving a limited menu, indicating there may be no power or only power from a generator or food supplies may be low. Red: the restaurant is closed, indicating severe damage"}
{"text":"these places are great...fast....good...and cheap.  you can also try grits which as it turns out are quite lovely.  this one is situated around several hotels, so it's a much better option than eating that free lobby shat."}
{"text":"Just barely sat in,  at least 10 servers and was not helped out for a long time. Finally got my order in and  staff is not happy at all. Will most likely be the last time I come here."}
{"text":"You don't expect much from a Waffle House and they still disappoint! Service terrible and the food was worse."}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it ! Decided to give this place a try and so glad we did and we'll definitely be back on another trip .I had the all star breakfast with raisin toast and grits ive never had grits before but very yummy and the ice tea is delicious. The staff was very friendly and welcoming thank you for a great experience and yummy food !"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst waffle houses I've been. I got something to drink and just sat and watching around just seeing how they do things. (I've been to Waffle House's all over) the only person to wash their hands was the cook and it wasn't very often.   The servers took dirty dishes off the table, then went to the clean dishes and started putting them away. Very disappointed in this place.   I was sitting in a Kay's section and she kept asking me when I was going to be ready to order. I let her know I was doing some work on my phone and I would order shortly. After about 20 minutes I told her I was ready to order and she pawned me off to another lady. NOT COOL.  Not to mention she is rude as hell and louder than my 3 year old.   This place is also very dirty."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have had. First took 10 min for service and there were 3 people working but noticed one guy who was off work get free chocolate milk like he owned the place. The food sucked and never got my waffle. Let's think about this I am at the Waffle House and didn't get my waffle that's after I told the waitress twice. Guess why you don't go there at 12am. Then I leave and cook says have a goodnight from his car. Really!!!  Cracker barrel here I come."}
{"text":"Ah, the Waffle House. I won't go into any detail regarding decor, food, or even service, because after sampling several dozen of these establishments across the country, I can say that they're all pretty much alike. What made this experience stand out was the fact that some poor kid was experiencing his first day at work here, and watching him blunder around blindly and watching the more experienced workers giving him only the minimum guidance (with maximum attitude) made this more like a dinner show than a simple late morning breakfast. It was riveting. I hope he hangs in there..."}
{"text":"I've been to a Waffle House before and the service was top notch and super fast so I was excited to try this one out. I came on a Sunday morning and the lady taking names didn't even greet me and was super rude, she also said the wait would be 15-20 minutes and we waited for almost an hour. When getting seated I noticed several dirty napkins utensils on the floor. then a young lady named Britney came to give us our drinks, she rudely asked \"who's the coffee for?\" we then waited for another 45 mins for our food and when we had to get up to ask for our waffles! when our waffles came they were cold and Britney rudely came back to take the plates we were done with and we could clearly hear her complaining about our table to another employee. there was never an apology for the wait or delay in our food. the whole staff looked very unprofessional and we're running around like they had no idea what to do. I'm only giving this place one star because I don't have the option for zero stars.  bottom line is there are other waffle houses in Phoenix and I definitely recommend going to another. the food is mediocre. the service, attitude and cleanliness are beyond poor. I will not be visiting this Waffle House again!"}
{"text":"It's closed indefinitely.... y'all need to update your site. Smh and you should really take down the highway sign if you're not planning on opening or at least let folks know you're closed."}
{"text":"It's a Waffle House. Years pass by and I see one and decide to eat at it. I ordered some eggs, pecan waffle and a cheesesteak melt. It's all very plain. Reminds me why I go years in between eating at Waffle Houses."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my breakfast today! I love trying out places I haven't been befire, and i must say this place is a bit unique. We sat at a table that was connected to the barstools and we could see all things in the kitchen. As simple as the menu is, our service was fast and efficient! When I get back close to another location I'm most definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Ok. So I always order the same thing when I make a Waffle House run. It's amazing how great it is when it's done right. It's quite another when not. Hash browns, scattered, smothered, peppered WELL. Lindsey, our incredibly witty waitress nailed it. She brought a smile to my face and this location is now on my MUST GO TO when traveling thru. There is only one other Waffle House which even can be compared and it's in Atlanta. Go!!!!  Enjoy!!!!  And Lindsey will make your day."}
{"text":"Gross! You don't know me, I don't know you.  Imagine. Rude service, standard coffee (didn't even ask if I wanted sugar at the table.) I got the steak and eggs. I'm a big man and usually love what I eat but this was gross. Poached eggs look like plastic eyeballs and the *steak* was all grissle. I enjoyed the toast. Please just drive down the street and go to sunnys diner I promise you if this is one hell reciew you take for granted it will be worth it, because that s**t at the Waffle House is nasty. At least when I took a bite and asked for the manager they didn't charge me and I left. Shoutout."}
{"text":"To start not good. We are from TX and love the waffle house. When we pulled up 2 cooks were outside playing around the waitress was on her cell phone there was no customers and tables were dirty. All of the staff working appeared to be teenagers or young 20's.   Now once we ordered the food was good and the waitress was on point and by this time they had a 1/4 full house. I will give them a 3star but be cautious when you first drive up."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here late nights the staff is ALWAYS friendly and quick with a joke and a smile!!!  the coffee is always plentiful and the price and quality of food is spectacular.  I get my eggs poached and never had them as good besides by momma!"}
{"text":"The truth about the waffle house.  The dirtier, the better.  This Waffle House location in particular is fairly clean ... fairly ... definitely not as dirty as those in the South and it's always busy.  Always busy!  I've dined in twice, ordered take out twice.  Both times I dined inside, no problem at all with my order.  When I ordered take out, both times, the orders were incorrect.  One time my order was incorrect slightly.  The next time I was totally giving someone else's food.    For instance, during my last take out order, I ordered a pecan waffle, sausage, scrambled eggs with cheese, grits with cheese.  After waiting about 20 - 30 mins or so, I received a Chocolate Chip waffle, sausage, scrambled eggs (No cheese), grits (no cheese).  Ham - No Burger, Peanut Butter - No Jelly lol ... that's kind of what the experience was like.  Granted, because I've experienced this before I should have thoroughly checked my bag before I left but I waited about 30 minutes and I was starving.  One of the workers noticed I was sitting around waiting a while so he offered me a drink while I waited. That was nice!  I will say, which I don't really want to mention, but the lady that took my order had a very hard time.  She repeated me and herself more than once, she wrote the order down really slow and asked someone else to add everything up for her because she couldn't do the math.  Understood!  However, she should not have been on the register or taking orders.  While the other worker added up my total and took my money, the initial server started wiping down the countertop.  On my way home I noticed a strange smell coming from the bag.  I grabbed the bag, sniffed harder and realized it smelled like old mop water.  Yuck!  This most have come from the rag the server used to wipe down the countertop.  Once I got in my house I opened the bag immediately and noticed that every single thing (except for the sausage) was wrong.  Everything!  I didn't bother calling the Waffle House to rectify the situation.  I decided to drive back up there and straighten things out.  When I got there I spoke to the manager, she searched for the ticket my order was written on and realized what I received is nothing like what I ordered.  She apologized, refunded me my money and personally made everything.  This is totally unexpected but appreciated."}
{"text":"I live in CA, we don't have Waffle Houses for what ever reason and I love this place! The waffles are huge and fluffy. The hash browns are great too and I'm somewhat of a hash brown snob. Our waitress was so southern and charming. So cute. AZ is not southern so this was a very welcome surprise. If ever I'm this way again I'd gladly go again."}
{"text":"Don't go to WH and expect 5* service, it's a DIVE DINER. You'll get \"how ya' doin' hon\", possible dirty table, people yelling across the place, sub-par water but again....it's a DIVE DINER! This is the same chain where Kid Rock got into a fist fight with another patron if that doesn't spell it out for you. This location was my first WH and the only one in Phoenix back in the day. You can imagine my squeals of delight when driving through Georgia, I saw a WH on every corner! Almost made me want to move there. Almost.  This is one of those places that I love sober, it's that good. There's something about those cheese 'n eggs that screams illegal. Many have tried but nobody can replicate that taste or that texture with those eggs. Unadulterated heaven on a plate!  Trust me my friend, get the cheese 'n eggs, hashbrowns covered and raisin toast (don't skimp on the apple butter). I don't do grits so I sub the grits for the hashies. Every once in a while, I walk on the wild side and get a waffle too. It IS the WAFFLE House afterall. I'm kinda glad we don't have these in San Diego because I'd probably weigh 1000lbs or be in the cardiac intensive care. Definitely my favorite breakfast. Or breakfast for dinner. Or 2am breakfast for drunkards."}
{"text":"The employees here are VERY friendly! I really love this Waffle House in particular because my (current) boyfriend and I came here for our first date, (it was beautiful). ...not that anyone cares...but Music from the jukebox is always playing, and the employees are easy to speak with, and the food is always hot and yummy!"}
{"text":"Would you like a side of grease with your grease? Because that's what's served up here 24/7.   Our hotel ended up being just two doors down from our hotel on Basline, so we ate here twice in one day. Once for breakfast and one late-night, farewell sesh to the WH. We stuck to the classics for breakfast, splitting a plain Belgian waffle and each having a bacon, egg & American cheese sandwich with a side of hash browns. You can get the browns a number of ways, but they're all served \"scattered,\" pretty much meaning they're thrown on the grill. Then you can go \"splattered\" (grilled onions), \"peppered\" (jalapenos), \"chunked\" (ham), \"capped\" (mushrooms)... you get the idea. You can even get all the fixins if you're feeling macho.  What would we order again and again if we had more than a few days in Arizona? Easily the Texas cheese melt--oohwhee, gooey cheesesteak and onions inside some bready Texas toast. Wash it down with their Iced Tea and pray to the Pepto Bismol gods for mercy."}
{"text":"Ugh...I had never been to a Waffle House, but my southern friends who frequent them a lot back home convinced me to try it out for a late night creep.  The food is just sub par and sits hard in your belly.  All I ordered was waffles and I wasn't impressed.  I do appreciate that they are open late, so I wont' \"throw the baby out with the bathwater\".  The cocoa was cool and the server was cute, sweet and attentive.  Fortunately for me, my taste buds are already spoiled with The Good Egg.  I'm so sorry I cheated on you baby!"}
{"text":"My dining companion and I visited This store around 5 pm.  As we entered, the cook and a server exited the building with individuals who appeared to be friends of the staff.  Immediately after sitting down, our server asked if we were ready to order or if we needed more time.  After telling her that we needed time she quickly walked away, without taking a drink order.  I watched the parking lot and saw the server having a conversation with someone at their car; the cook had to be summoned inside several minutes after our order was made.  My companion and I were the only customers in the restaurant.  Once the three person team was reassembled they were invested more in personal conversation rather than the task at hand.  At some point, we lost visuals on the servers and when the cook hollered \"Order up!\" the servers we nowhere to be found.  He brought it to us, annoyed, after about a half minute of him calling for the servers.  My companion ordered a side salad, bacon and a strawberry waffle.  I ordered a triple smothered, covered and capped hash browns.  The salad was full of yellowed iceberg lettuce and over ripe tomatoes.  His waffle was overcooked and the strawberry sauce inside crystallized making pebble like pieces.  However, the most shocking part was my hash browns.  The platter full of beautifully browned potatoes was horribly scarred by a single slice of processed cheese that appeared to have encountered a nuclear melt down. There were no onions.  When I brought it up the server admitted that she did not write it down.  The cook did offer to correct the mistake but I was far enough into the dish that the lack of onions was less heartbreaking than the deception of smothered in cheese.   In retrospect, we should have left.  We witnessed the servers play with a puppy in the parking lot.  We overhead gossip.  My iced tea refill was simply a cup of tea. The salad had browned leaves hidden within.  Any time I tried to get the attention of the staff they were busy doing something other than work.    We left confused and stunned as to what really transpired during our meal.  I am a customer who enjoys a relaxed environment however I still have the expectation of manners.  If I don't text during my meal, my expectation is that my server will restrain as well.  I expect a quality of food that's equal to or BETTER than what I can make at home.  My expectation is food that's better than what you can find in a frat house, especially from an established budget eatery!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, they're never bring the rest of the food and still charge it..."}
{"text":"Wait for 20 min to be seated. When we did get our seat. We had no help just sat there waiting for another 25 min. We didn't even get asked for drinks. Then, we overheard the cashier say they were only accepting CASH, no Cards. One waitress said we have a sign on the door, but as we left the sign was facing inward. So, anyone coming in wouldn't see it. It was only noticeable as we left the place. Bad experience from the get-go. Waited for nothing and no immediate service for a small eating area. We are heading to Golden Corral instead."}
{"text":"Waffle House was the bomb it was like a volcano errupted for food in my breakfast bowl of sausage,eggs , creamy cheese . I felt st home I got to take my dentures out lol"}
{"text":"Last time I was at a waffle house was about 15 years ago and was amazing! Times have changed. My wife, son and I stopped here on our way back to CA a few days ago. We were met at the door and seated promptly. It was very busy. Our waitress, Andrea, was nice, though quite rushed. She took our order and delivered our drinks...all's well. We watched our waffles being cooked and then placed on a counter. They looked good. Sadly, it took another five mins for our food to arrive, incorrectly. Our waffles still looked good way over there. I pointed out the errors in both mine and my wife's meals. Andrea took then to make them right. Waffles were looking good. She returned a couple mins later with sad fixes, but sorta fixes. We asked about our waffles and she turned and got them. They were naturally cold so we asked for something a little fresher. The waffle girl got right on them. A couple bites into our meals and we realized our meat hadn't made it out yet. A couple mins later we flagged down Andrea who apologized and found some meat for us. The new waffles were very good. In the end, the food was adequate but the service was too bad to return. At least there are many to try in the area, we have very few in Cali."}
{"text":"I like it better then Denny's so I stop on by to get some breakfast. It's okay not the best place in the world but if your having a hard time picking between after hours with Dennys and Waffle house I would pick waffle house for sure."}
{"text":"Quick and courteous service. Amber is always great and love the waffles and bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ugh was craving biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were so doughy and gross. Service was bad, which I didn't expect much but won't be back"}
{"text":"Really like watching my meal being cooked. All fresh ingredients prepared per order. No heat lamps warming precooked food.  Always friendly servers.   Prices are reasonable.  No scrimping on meal sizes either."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast yesterday. My wife had an omelet and it tasted so fluffy and fresh, along with some great tasting biscuits & gravy. I had very crispy hash browns smothered & covered, (grilled onions and cheese), bacon and a biscuit. What a GREAT breakfast. I never saw the bottom of my coffee cup. We need to start coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Slow service but good food...usual consistency on the food.  Hash browns cooked as ordered.  The burger tasted good and was cooked well."}
{"text":"You'd think food was free here! This place seems packed 24/7. We stayed at the Courtyard across the street and it was so busy day and night we were almost afraid to head over.  However, we went for breakfast and had great service. As with all Waffle Houses this one is very affordable and the food is low grade but packs value. Staff is very well mannnered and helpful."}
{"text":"This location excellent! Great service, atmosphere is welcoming and some of the best and most seasoned waffle house cooks and salespeople!"}
{"text":"Everything was executed to perfection! My tastebuds will forever be grateful to the Gastonia's waffle chef that cooked my very first,  delicate & subtle gourmet \"All Star Special\" to perfection. I will not be surprised to see the French people capitulate. Soon enough they will fall for the finger licking Waffle House's cuisine and they will forever forego their ridiculous cultural pride towards the thin pancakes they call crêpes. Our waffle connoisseur hostess was abrupt and sophisticated in the same time, like the sweet and salty deliciousness of fake maple syrup dripping down my fried bacon. Our concealed gun carrying cook can perfectly execute breakfast and protect us in the same time.  This was a life changing experience, I need to quit my comfortable US corporate manager job and open a \"Maison du Waffle\" in France...as soon as the Air France pilot strike allows me to fly back to the old continent.  ~ A converted Frenchman"}
{"text":"Clean and friendly.  A lot better than the usual fast-food breakfast at the drive-thru.  Had a big ol' waffle and coffee.  Couldn't be better."}
{"text":"it was a 6 hour plane ride from SF. i arrived at charlotte at 6am west coast time. the car rental place denied me a rental because i was but a few weeks from 25. i called my brother and waited the 45 minutes while he rolled out of bed, put gas in his car and rolled on over (he lives in charlotte). during this time, i was stressed, crying and being told by the southern folks there that SF is where all the crazy people are...  my brother took me to the waffle house for breakfast...and it made it all better.   HOW MANY WAYS CAN YOU HAVE YOUR HASH BROWNS?!?!?!?!?!?!  smothered with jalapenos, cheese, nacho cheese, gummy bears, marshmallows, brussel sprouts...maybe not, but it seems that way.  if you are ever in the south, try the waffle house, any of them. they are  EVERYWHERE. we mustve eaten at one for almost every meal for a week..."}
{"text":"The food is decent; however the tables were super dirty. We came in as a family of five and nine of us wanted to sit down. My husband wiped down the table with a napkin and then someone came over and wipe down the table. Sat down and no one gave us menus. Saw the worker wipe down the menu before giving to us. I've been here many times, but this is the worst I've seen this place. Employees were cursing amongst themselves."}
{"text":"Ok reviewing the Waffle House is kinda lame, but here goes.  If you have lived in America at any point in the last 50 years you know they have good waffles and hash browns.  Is it the best breakfast option you could possibly encounter, well no.  It's just every once in awhile I find I just want Waffle House. ( Fond late night memories from college I would guess. )  It can be for breakfast, lunch, dinner, whenever.  So what does this location have going for it that makes it better than the average Waffle House?  1. Lots of parking 2. It's not in a shady part of town 3. It has a really nice staff  4. They are fairly speedy 5. The restaurant is clean  So there you go if you have a craving for waffles and hash browns then this is one of the better WH in the area."}
{"text":"No stars if possible. I walked in with my bf at 9:45. The place was now packed. All servers acknowledge we came in and says down. However none of them attended to is immediately, which was understandable. 9:55 NOT a single server had said \"I'll be right with you\" or even brought out menus (we didn't need them because we already new what we wanted but besides the point) 10:00 2 gentlemen walked in were acknowledged, they picked a table and sat down. 10:02 a server went straight to them gave them menus and got their drinks. Needless to say we promptly got up and left. This is unsatisfactory, I've never experienced this kind of behavior before even in a Sunday after church packed Waffle House. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened with first poster, but found the staff here very courteous and friendly. They are a joking bunch, so the \"told me how I wanted my eggs\" was probably a mistaken try at a joke. Get a sense of humor and sense of adventure, and you'll be fine.  Anyway....food was excellent, and while the place was busy, we had just a short wait, and the lady checking for open tables even brought us drinks (coffee, water) while we waited. Have I had better food? Of course. The fact remains though you come to a Waffle House for good food fast, not Tilapia and stuffed shirt maitre D's. As a Waffle House location, it's does very well at what is intended, and the staff's friendliness is what got the 5th star."}
{"text":"Small portion meals they cook the food in the open very quiet and the server and cook is very polite located right off the 101"}
{"text":"\"Cheezebuhguh!  Cheezebuhguh!\"  Quite an entertaining bunch of employees at 4 A.M."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Waffle House in my life.  This one is very small and cute.  Sat at the counter and our server Sierra was excellent.  She was so efficient. I used an Entertainment book coupon and they took coupon even on the specials that we ordered.  Most places dont so this was a plus.  I ordered egg bacon and cheese sandwich with hashbrowns.  Very good.   My friend ordered the hasbrown bowl.   It had hashbrowns, sausage, scrambled eggs and cheese also very good.  The staff were all very friendly.  I will come back and I do recommend this WaffleHouse."}
{"text":"It's not fancy and sometimes it can be a little ghetto depending on the folks inside but the food is good and the service excellent."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was quick! There was a long line of people, but the quick and friendly service was phenomenal and ready for the challenge and executed to feed our happy tummies  ! I suggest this place to anyone passing by and wanting a nice hearty breakfast!"}
{"text":"This particular waffle house has the best staff i have ever come across at any waffle house i have had  breakfest ever, they are so welcoming,friendly, and they make you feel as if you are one of the family and not to mention that the food was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The food was average, it is nothing to write about. The waffles were decent but thin and soft and almost soggy. The service was very good, April was a great server. The prices are within reason, however other diners have the same prices but you get more for your money. This place has a very \"middle of nowhere, backwoods, country greasy spoon\" atmosphere. I felt comfortable but that might not be for everyone. The seating is minimal so I would not bring more than a total of 4 people or you'll be packed like a can of sardines. I had a good first experience here and I'd come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today. Pretty good overall. I got the hash brown bowl that was good. I asked if I could have my eggs over easy instead of scrambled (like it comes in the picture). She said sure, finished out orders and left. I noticed that for a place called waffle house, they only had about four different types of waffles. Waffles and chicken wasn't on the menu either. That's like IHOP not having pancakes. It's weird, right? When I finally got my bowl, I got scrambled instead of over easy, which sucked but overall the bowl was really good and filling. The place is relatively small, but stayed full during my visit. I probably won't return though. It's nothing super spectacular that I have to have."}
{"text":"Stop here for breakfast and meet Katie. She is so friendly, polite and customer service oriented!  We thoroughly enjoyed our perfectly cooked breakfast and Katie was an extra special treat. Happy morning!"}
{"text":"This piece of shit place doesn't even answer the phone. How are THEY still in business with SUCH SHIT SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this particular Waffle House a few times and they always do a great job cooking the classic Waffle House items. Had the best Waffle House T-bone I've had at any of their locations here. Usually safe at this location for a good meal."}
{"text":"Good. Just what you expect from a traditional breakfast diner. Great service! Clean and good location for spring training breakfast."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place is open 24/hours. We got our food to-go, so I couldn't really tell you what dining there was like.   To be honest, the reason we got our food to go was because its a shit-hole structurally, and we didn't feel like being inside."}
{"text":"Went in at 6:30am for breakfast and the music was so loud it was almost painful to the ears. I am hard of hearing and require hearing aides (which I wasn't wearing) and this music was WAY too loud for me. I can't imagine those with good hearing.  I asked the waitress to turn it down and she mumbled something about not having a remote and walked away. I heard another customer ask them to turn it down and they told him they couldn't.  I don't have any idea what the deal is with the volume but I will never go in this place again if the music is that loud. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"my 2nd time at a WH and I think they are great. Open 24 hours. We were in Phoenix visiting family and staying in a hotel with my parents and needed to get some alone time. Cheap, diner food, but always freshly made. I had waffles and they come with all kinds of topping options. I had plain and they are still very fresh and light. The loaded hash browns here are great too and you can choose from chili, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, ham, sausage, cheese, gravy or all of them. My hubby had all and it was really good. Really fast service and cheap prices."}
{"text":"After extending our 4th of July weekend to include a roadtrip to see the Dodgers finally win over Arizona, we stopped again at this Waffle House, still the closest to the PRC, a family fun highlight of the trip.  Waffle House roadtrip anticipation--Which is almost as fun as those blowing-up-propane-BBQ-tanks-with-a-Glock-in-the-desert-trips years ago.   Ahhhhhh....Arizona.  Having gotten tired of eating waffles with all manner of foodstuffs stuck between them, we (a family unit) chowed down on real...round...old school...waffles. Not those oversized \"Belgian\" waffles that taste like a ceiling tile and take the skin off the roof of your mouth. Also highly recommended is the chili--after dozens of visits over the years and around the fruited plain, in lieu of eggs with my waffle I do chili and waffles... breakfast, lunch and dinner.  After milking our check-out time for a few more hours at the hotel, it's time to unplug the laptop, hit the road and have another early waffley dinner...with a Texas sausage melt for dessert."}
{"text":"It's 33 outside and they have the air on!  at 12:30am Don't have an all new staff and not have at least 1 experienced WH employee! Over easy eggs were more like an omelette . Waffle light came out brown toasted. TOAST?! Ha burnt Bacon large is FIVE (5) strips not 4. Been ordering the same meal forever and I get challenged by a new waitress. What tops it is was charged for 2 breakfast plates and the order was :  1 All-star breakfast over easy, wheat plate, hash Browns, waffle light. Make the bacon large and add another waffle light . Suppose to be ONE breakfast plate! Oh yea...the OJ machine broken UGH means NO OJ."}

As my friends and I walked in (group of 5), we did not see any servers; there were not greetings, and the front counter was dirty. When looked around for a server, one of the cooks in the back said that there was no more clean plates to serve us."}

The boy got two pork chops n eggs with double smothered n covered potatoes. Sooo mine was lick the plate good and his was no meat on the bone good!!   Oh and the best for last... MIA kept us entertained our whole visit!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Got my order wrong, and while they were cooking my order.  Staff was laughing and just cussing at each other as if I wasn't even there.  I'm cool with an occasional cuss word but it was F words left and right.  Then since I just wanted to get the hell out out of there, they got my order wrong and I was already home.  I complained on their website and I promptly received a call from their \"people\".  Who said they saw nothing on their cameras of such an incident .  I'm like, they weren't fighting, they were cussing horribly.  They did nothing to make me happy about my experience and at least apologize for short changing me on my meal"}

Had to seat myself because they never called my name after waiting, then no one came to take my order or give water. Had to flag someone down. I work in hospitality myself and I was appalled when I told her that we had been waiting a long time and she felt the need to argue with me. I asked her why she was arguing with me and she says she has the right to defend herself. What an interesting world it would be if we all had the right to argue with our guests."}
{"text":"Horrible service after night 2:10 am , big old fat lady took my waffle plate after making it without  sanitation gloves very dirty &  we argue about her not putting extra chocolate chip on my Waffle when she charged me dollar extra. Not worth my money nor time. Definitely calling cooperate"}
{"text":"Ate eggs and bacon toast with a glass of water got food poisoning. They are dirty be careful don't sit at the counter the dish washing liquid splashes on to your food"}
{"text":"Let me first start off with saying WOW! This place is amazing super clean and the food is out of this world the waffles are made to order of course and the staff is by far the best their personality just made the experience complete the service was speedy and attention to detail you ask for it they make it happen if you want smothered waffles you got it and the waitress Miss dee and Miss Red where great!! All I can say is that I'll come back any time!!"}
{"text":"We were going to go here for bfast this morning.  However when we got there we saw a server out front rushing inside with a cigarette...she put it out in the dirt and left it on the brick ledge by the door...I popped out to go inside and the smell of smoke was so strong I told my family not to even get out of the car. This has completely turned us away from wanting to eat here. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast at 0430. Just your basic good old greasy spoon type of dinner. Get a pecan waffle.. you will NOT be disapointed."}
{"text":"Just stopped in on our drive to Yuma, Az. It is Christmas Eve and everyone working was festively dressed and happy. The food was delivered quickly and delicious. I obviously had a waffle!"}
{"text":"Well I called to ask a question about the burgers and got hung up on by a rude employee.. Well, I guess I'll take my business elsewhere.  If waffle house had any sense they'd hire relatively competent staff, and staff that cared to work there and provide good customer service.  Regional manager should be ashamed at this location"}
{"text":"I come here way to often and always have an awesome experience. Tonight was a mess, nor only did it take an extremely long time for the food, when mine came out it was uneatable.  It was burnt on edges, crisp amf soaked in strawberry syrup. In the time I was waiting a table of 8 left,  the ladies behind me changed theirs to go and my three year old was starving. The servers were amazing as ALWAYS, BUT NOT ONCE DID I SEE THE MANAGER COME ON THE FLOOR TO CHECK ON THINGS, APOLOGISE OR ANYTHING. Until I asked for him, even then  I got he had to help in the kitvhen. I get it but when your losing business,  people walking out,  oders changing to Carryout...you make it your business to check the floor even if it's one round.  The servers were more apologetic then the  manager, which then I felt bad for them add they are awesome."}
{"text":"I stopped in this morning after voting for a quick bite to eat.  The food is good.  The price is great too for what you get.  I tend to get small hash browns, cubed ham and cheese.  The servers always have a nice smile and make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Came here in the afternoon with a friend and definitely regret choosing this place. Staff is not friendly at all and we waited over 20 minutes just to have some one take our drink order. The person that finally takes our drink order places the silver ware on a napkin and practically throws it on the table. Just flat out rude. She brought or drinks and I asked her for straws 3 times and she finally  gave them to me... Again throwing them on my table...definitely not coming this place again!"}
{"text":"My order:2 Eggs breakfast with bacon and oatmeal.....  I ordered the Basted Eggs medium and they came out runny.  It's a good thing THAT doesn't bother me.  A cook who doesn't know the difference between \"Easy\", Medium\", \"Hard\", is bad.....in my book.  Just saying.  My bacon came out burned.  Funny, I didn't even ask for it crispy.  It was OK.  My SO took the burned bacon and gave me his. . Everything else was excellent and super fast.  My S/O Order: All Star Breakfast special:  His came out perfect.  How do you mess up scrambled eggs, hash browns, and toast, lol?  The service was great.  Very nice and friendly staff.  Would go again."}
{"text":"I went there Thanksgiving night . The all American was awesome. Friendly people there . My waitress asked me several times of eve tuning was ok ."}
{"text":"My first Waffle House experience. Good simple food and nice portions. Jerimiah was outstanding and hustling, but the service to get a seat and to pay to leave is sloooow. The crew was hustling and getting orders out, could be cleaned up a tad, as others have said, but the effort of the staff was 100% to me."}
{"text":"holy crap they have an all you can eat menu!! they cook it right in front of you and it is really good!! the dirty floors and flat soda is all part of a great experience. Waffle House is all about really good food in a crappy, hey you gonna eat that, type of atmosphere. Look at it this way, you ate, got full, paid, walked out with noisy shoes and didn't get robbed. success!!"}
{"text":"Service was the slowest of any Waffle House I have ever eaten at (and that is quite a few). As we waited for our breakfast we watched the kitchen staff do their thing. Aside from the cooks standing in about 1/2 of spilled waste water puddled on the floor with a piece of raw bacon laying in it. Egg shells dropped on the floor, dropped spoons - all being walked on by the staff. It was truly disgusting. This place needs a visit from the Health Department. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"This is my best breakfast place. It's much cheaper then IHOP or village inn. I walk out usually paying less then 25 dollars including a big tip for two people. I always get the cheese n eggs with jalapeños and gravy on my hashbrowns. I'm so happy with the amount of jalapeños  and  gravy! I love spicy and they are never shy with them! This is my first go to breakfast place. It's just so simple and so delicious with the chocolate milk, oj, sweet tea is so good and great coffee. The service is always great, sometimes I wait like 5 minutes on the weekend when it's busy. I'm always coming back and leaving so full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Pretty much the only thing open at 1 AM. Nice employees and was able to be sat right when we walked in. Basic as far as food options go, but the price was right. Best item on the menu to order you ask? Just go with the waffles."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap breakfast. Wait staff is horrible to the point of hilarity. If the waffles weren't so delicious and cheap we would not come here based on wait staff."}
{"text":"The Waffle House is kind of like an old friend.  You may not visit them very often, but you're always glad to know that they're there.  And dagnabbit, sometimes you just NEED to have a triple order of fresh hash browns in the middle of the night  May be a little bit too brightly lit for my tastes, especially in the wee smalls, but the food is consistent and the service alway polite and attentive without being pushy  Oh btw, always make sure you tip a little extra to the good peeps working the overnight shift   ; )"}
{"text":"Despite this place looking run down I decided to give it a try. Nothing about my experience was even decent and we even had to wait to sit down. We ordered OJ that took 15 minutes to get to us and when it finally did it tasted like chemicals. Our food took at least 30 minutes to get to us, our server may have forgotten to put the order in. Then she explained how sorry she was and how she was going to give us a discount. When I received the bill it was a whole $2.50 off. Only decent thing about this place was how cheap it was but I would much rather go to Denny's."}
{"text":"I have been to many Waffle Houses before, but this one is gross. I had to get up and leave due to general lack of cleanliness. We sat down at a \"just cleaned\" table which still had a big smudge of syrup or jam on it, then we grabbed our menus which also had finger-smudged gunk all over them. I ordered an ice tea and the aftertaste of it was gross... it had been over-brewed. It was incredibly cold in there as well, which was totally unnecessary considering the temperature outside was in the 70's. Yet they had the AC on full blast and I was uncomfortably chilly. The final straw for me was when I saw a small group of flies buzzing around next to the window near my table... at first I didn't think anything of it; I thought they were outside the window. But then I noticed they were all actually inside, and if I can see that many flies right at my table, there must be quite a few roaming freely inside the restaurant. Overall lack of cleanliness made us get up and leave. I shall not come back to this particular Waffle House."}
{"text":"Lots of food for a low price. The service was really good and I ate so much it was almost disgusting. Even left my credit card there and they found it and held it for me (I'm not used to that). I do wish the tables were clean? They seemed a little sticky and had crumbs/water rings on them.... Other than that, I think it was great!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to The Waffle house. Food isn't very good.  I wasn't impressed with the food what so ever ,  not very big selection on the menu.  I also ordered a waffle with my meal but wasn't given syrup.  Had to wait awhile before the waitress brought me syrup. I won't be coming here again,  so many other places to go for breakfast that are delicious & have a better selection."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but it seems like they don't know who to hire (jail birds or the elderly). Twice now we've had to buss our own tables, but the food again is good. I feel they just need to screen their employees better...  And pay attention to what people order...   P.S. Kudos to the managers for trying to be accommodating I guess...."}
{"text":"Wow, newly rebuilt store, same crappy food and service... My wife ordered a to go order and we were charged almost $10 more than what the menu said everything was priced... When we finally got home with the food, we were missing several items and the food was not cooked how we ordered... I guess that part is our fault since we didn't check it before we left... My wife ordered the biscuits and gravy, the biscuits were still frozen when we got home and there was maybe 2 or 3 tablespoons of gravy, barely enough to moisten the biscuits... I had a double cheeseburger with bacon, and ordered the toppings on the side... Nothing was on the side, it was all on the burger which made the bread soggy by the time we got home, and the bacon was a little more than crispy... It was black and almost not edible... Please take the extra few minutes to drive to another WH location as they are spread all over Charlotte..."}
{"text":"Good quality food, served fast by a friendly server!  My waffle was very good, as were the grits...creamy with butter! Egg was fine, but the hash browns should have been cooked a bit more.  They have excellent, smooth coffee, served hot on their Waffle House mug.  The host greeted us and made sure we got seated as soon as a booth was ready. I appreciated the time he took to clean the table and the seats of the booth. When a place cares about keeping it clean for the customers that says a lot.  Overall, a nice breakfast place...too bad they don't have one in OC."}
{"text":"It's good ol' Waffle House!  My friend and I arrived on Sunday afternoon after church ,the staff greeted us right away when we walked in. It's seat yourself, so we found a booth right by the window and a few moment later our waitress came over.   She was pleasant, she grabbed our drinks and when she came back we already knew what we wanted to order. I went with the lunch special chicken, bacon and cheese sandwich. It comes with a drink and hash browns.   I may be the only one, but I love it when they call out the orders to the cook. I mean sure it's loud but its always entertaining especially when it comes to the hash browns ...\"SCATTERED, SMOTHERED, PEPPERED and COVERED\"...lol what?!!? Awesome and delicious!   Anyway, I digress, our food was ready fast and came out hot. The chicken sandwich was good, the bread was a little soggy and the bacon could have been crispier but it was still a pretty decent sandwich. The star of the meal was my hashbrowns...I love them extra crispy and loaded with goodies especially the jalapenos...do yourself a favor and just try it! But overall, it was a good meal.    I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My final WH of my NC stay and our waitress was the best ever! She has been working at WH since she was 17 and she is probably around 60 now. She was attentive friendly, funny and informative. the food was piping hot and exactly as I expect it to be.  I will eat at this WH whenever I am in Belmont, NC. Try the new dark roast coffee."}
{"text":"Ok- it's a Waffle House- same menu, same food pretty much and for the most part same quality. But what makes this Waffle House in Charlotte NC rate five stars is the cleanliness and the friendliness! I arrived here at a good time- 6 am- it was after the night of the living drunk crowd and before the main morning breakfast rush- so the night shift had a little time to clean up the place- may explain the change of shift cleanliness. But from the wait staff to the cook- the service I got was extraordinary- treated me last like I was a one of their regulars- instant hellos, initiating pleasant conversations - even my waitress was singing the theme song from Mr. Rodgers neighborhood- extraordinary for a night shift employee at the END of their shift- plus coffee was fresh hot and constantly flowing- Again- OK- it's a Waffle House- but don't tell that to the employees- they might stop caring about the customer!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for 25 minutes and order not even called in yet! People that came in after us are already finishing up their meals. Jonquil came back strong through. Got the manager to comp our meal for the long delay. Tipped him handsomely for the recovery. Will definitely return when i am in the area next time."}
{"text":"First time ever trying this place and I was completely disappointed and disgusted! The server didn't offer to get us anything to drink till we were ready to order our food. Then right when I get my plate of food I see a bug crawl out from under it. I tell the server and she just casually wipes it off the counter. It wasn't a big deal, since it wasn't on my food. As I begin to eat my food I pick up my toast ready to take a bite and I see another bug! Dead. On my toast. I tell the server again and she just smiles and asks if I wanted her to bring more toast. Never going back there again!"}
{"text":"If you are coming home from a concert, driving across town, you are drunk, or you like old style diners then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Waffle House never disappoints on breakfast and always delivers on cleanliness.  All Star is the place to be for sure.  Greasy goodness when you are hankering for calories."}
{"text":"Jeremiah was an excellent server!! Food was great as usual and it was fun to watch the cook behind the counter... he was a machine! It's great to see people take pride in their work and these folks clearly did!"}
{"text":"Been going here about six times a year since 2013. The food is pretty consistent, so is the service.  The menu has shrunk in the past year.  You should probably look over the menu online before going over there to eat. This restaurant is open 24 hours a day, all year long. But I'm not sure if they're open on the major holidays or not. You might call on those days before driving over.  The breakfast menu is actually pretty small now.   My only complaint is the flies. The place always has a decent bunch of flies buzzing around inside. Aside from that I have no complaints. I prefer this restaurant over ihop, which is about a mile straight south of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Gotta try the biscuits n gravy, be sure to ask for the jalapeño biscuits!! They always give you plenty of gravy!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and cheap. It's Waffle House so I don't expect it to be fancy. But I will say this is the cleanest location I've ever been to. Each time we've gone the staff has always been exceptionally friendly! Great breakfast and a great price."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Service was excellent.  Value is good.  Entire staff overall very friendly.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Lately this seems to be our go-to brunch spot after church.   However, it's ALWAYS super packed. I know....shocking a brunch place is pack on a Sunday!   So most of the time it's to-go orders....I basically order the same thing ever time The All-Star Special which comes with a waffle, eggs (any way you like), your choice of bacon, ham or sausage and then a side (hashbrowns, grits).   And yes....I eat all of it. NO judgement. I work out....(kinda!)   Anyway, the ordering process is pretty easy and there's never been an issue with the order so I'd say they are A-OK in my book.  On another note, I will say that it's nice to have another option outside of IHOP on this side of town....."}
{"text":"Every time I stop there the staff are friendly and the food is good. What more do you want at 3am on a Wednesday?"}
{"text":"It's a greasy spoon joint, and is exactly what the doctor ordered. Pecan waffle was outstanding, the smell of the batter cooking was heavenly. Grabbed a double drop of hashbrowns with diced ham and gravy. Didn't expect to get so much, ended up having the rest for an awesome breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"Fairly new and still amazing! One of the best Waffle Houses I have ever ate at. Everyone is friendly and you get super speedy service"}
{"text":"The three stars are only bc I don't think the intent of the ladies there were malicious just not professional. The food was mediocre the service was subpar. I don't have high expectations for Waffle House because well...its Waffle House, but this location was definitely not meeting even minimum expectations. No one greeted me, it took awhile before someone would take my order and again the food wasn't good. I'll stick to my regular Independence location from now on."}
{"text":"I first came to waffle house back in Orlando when I went there for Disneyland so it was a nice surprise for me to see it here in Charlotte.   I walked in and the staff immediately greeted me and sat me at the table. They took my drink order and asked if I knew if I wanted I want to eat.   The waitress was nothing but sweet kept saying please and thank you and sweetie, which I liked.   Being in LA you're not used to this southern hospitality but it was pretty awesome.   I ordered the steak special with hashbrowns toast and eggs. For the price it was a great deal 1145.   My steak was cooked just the way I wanted it medium. Sounds toasty and my toast gently toasted with butter.   I enjoy my food.   I would order the dish again and I will come back."}
{"text":"Normally pretty good but the last few visits they've fallen flat. Staff unmanaged and to busy talking on cells and texting while cooking. Totally unsanitary. Waffle House in Belmont is better."}
{"text":"My first time here. Food was really good. Their speciality waffle was thinner than expected but excellent. I asked for eggs over medium and got over easy. The server was very attentive and very good. She did get our order correct so the kitchen was at fault on the eggs. It would be nice if there was a uniform definition of what over easy, medium, well, or scrambled eggs are exactly.   The reason for 4 stars is the place was filthy. Everything on the tables including menus were sticky with syrup. Window sills were dirty. The floors were filthy. I watched other servers take uneaten food off of plates, wrap it in foil and put in refrigerator. The kitchen was very unkempt and needed to be cleaned.   OK, so I was there at 9am but the old restaurant adage of clean as you go should still apply even if there is a kid running the place and you're open 24hrs.  This tells me they have serious management issues.   I will be back because of the server and the fact food was good but it won't be because of how clean it was."}
{"text":"Maybe my standards are low, but I have always loved this place. The company I work for used to hold training classes in Mesa, and I always tried to make it here at least once for each visit. WH is big in the south, and I think AZ is the furthest western location of any WH. Most are just like any fast food, but you get to see the cook, and they have waitresses who step lively between their various chores.  The last time I was there , the group of co-workers I was with was amazed at the price we paid. I think the most expensive thing was a NY steak for 10 bucks.  If you like a \"hangover\" style meal (breakfast anytime, greasy-but-good burgers, etc.) this is the place. And there's thousands of variations to the basic menu.  Grits, hash browns, chili, greasy/good burgers. And folks that look like they should be servin' them to you.  God, I wish there was one close by, but my health is better for the fact there isn't."}
{"text":"Nobody has reviewed this place yet!?  Wow.  I get to pop Wa Ho's cherry!    Lucky me!  Let me smother and cover you with my love!  Wa Ho is the best place to go after the party is over and the club has ended.  Just don't expect friendly service.  Wa Ho's waitresses are notorious for being the rudest people on Earth and they will mess with your food if you provoke them."}
{"text":"Screw this location. I sat for 10 minutes and no one offered me a damn thing, even with 6 servers in front of me bs'ing about what was gross in the sink and who was more ditzy. I am pregnant and just wanted GRITS! I'll stick to the west and north valley Waffle House!"}
{"text":"Yep, it's just a Waffle House.  This one is a bit below average in cleanliness and service.  An average Waffle House would get three stars; this one gets just two."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because the waitress was super nice, and the waffles are awesome!  The place is kinda shady, doesn't accept bills over $20  after 2pm..lol...  atmosphere is nice, and food come out fast!   My friend had the BLT, and he said it was good.  I had the blueberry waffle and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this Waffle House a higher rating but can't. The waitresses and some of the other staff don't seem to care about their jobs. I get that this is a diner but dang. Could you act like we matter long enough to get our drinks and take our order before you decide to lit with a coworker, go for a smoke, and come back and act out with another waitress who thinks it is a good idea to cuss in front of children? You are at work! Act like it.   The cooks are sweet and made our food very well. Everything was made and served in a good amount of time. The gentleman who prepared our food asked how everything was and I told him it was good and thanked him. He was a sweetie. The rest of the staff were a mess. I won't be coming to this Waffle House again.   My rating for my food is 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I had to put 3 stars for food only. The waiter is friendly and patience.  The food: it doesn't look exactly from the menu which I thought it looked good. Hash brown looked like squashed. Where is the nice neat circle hash brown? I ordered Grilled Bacon chicken sandwiches. It was alright.  Would I come again? Hmm probably the next five or ten years later."}
{"text":"So I've always called this place Awful House, and really it aint that bad.   For some reason I thought it would be like an extra ghetto Dennys with more roaches and surly teenagers, but it was spotless and ruckus-free.   The waitress seemed happy to have people ordering more than just coffee and was pretty attentive, especially for a diner.  Good selection for a late nite menu. Im always down for late night eats and now this is one more place to try when the city is too hot to venture out in during the day."}
{"text":"I love Waffle House! This location is an awesome one. It's right down the street from where I live. The place is always clean and the service is extra friendly. I get the All Star breakfast. The chocolate chip waffles are awesome and the coffee is always fresh! Stay away Sunday mornings after church or you'll be waiting for hours. Good good for a good price! Go to this location :)"}
{"text":"This waffle house sucks because of the customer service the waiters they don't care. we were there waiting for food almost 40 minutes and nothing we complained  and told them that other people that were behind us were getting their food first and they did not care so we had to leave and go somewhere else which sucks because I like the chocolate chip waffle."}
{"text":"My wife was eating her food and the waitress attempted to take her food from her. Then the waitress brought a box as my wife was still eating and kept coming back for asking for us to pay the check. My wife left there in tears. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"I loooooove waffles!  My first time ever eating at waffle house was in VA and this place was just as good. Their service was great and quick.  I can't wait to visit this place in october."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  The cook was a friendly young man who cooked our breakfast exactly as we requested. It was perfect.  Aly waited on us and was very friendly.  This could not have been any better.  Great value for the money spent."}
{"text":"The waffle house is the bomb!   This location is like every other location. You're going to enjoy everything about it. We can get busy and it's not in the nicest area but the food is fantastic the service is really good and you're just going to enjoy yourself. You"}
{"text":"Dear Yelpers,  I have many fond memories in the waffle houses around our dear valley. Why? because I went to college, and I wasn't always under the influence of strictly oxygen if you know what I mean.  The place is what it is. Hightened sensory perception makes it \"burn a little brighter\" perhaps , but its A FRIGGIN WAFFLE HOUSE!  Most Sincerely, Dr. Obvious."}
{"text":"If you want something extremely late at night, very unhealthy, but deliciously tasty and not so expensive, then come here. I am really impressed how the ONE cook was able to keep up with all of the orders. He was young so clearly did not have much experience but handled it all well. I hope he makes it to culinary school if that's what his dream is.   Side-note: If you squeeze your sausage or bacon in your napkin it will remove some of the calories. Lol."}
{"text":"I love Waffle House. All of them. Small little place but who cares. The food is always so yummy and I don't ever get sick of it. Would recommend any location. Mmmmmmm!!"}
{"text":"I am currently sitrying in this waffle house 05/28/16 and cannot wait for the experience to be over. The waitress does not want to serve us. Her name is Robin. I haven't seen her smile, she is rude, and her tone is not inviting in the least. They need to do something with her because I am a regular waffle house patron and I have been to them all over the US. This is bbb review worthy."}
{"text":"They have waffles! And it's not waffle shaped pancakes, they're waffle waffles (waffle shaped pancakes is an abomination and legitimate problem in the food world).  Protip: If you like your hashbrowns extra brown, everything is made to order so feel free to have it extra crispy."}
{"text":"I've gone to Waffle House all over this country for over 20 years now. I like to visit this location cuz they are really friendly and treat you like one of the family."}
{"text":"So I went into Waffle House to get my sweet tea fix- since I live in Arizona good sweet tea like thy make in the south is hard to come by... If you are looking for genuine southern nitty gritty greasy good ol' fashion food-search no longer! Sure the place inside my smell and May not look the cleanest but hey then again all the BEST PLACES have something wrong with them haha  The PRICE IS JUST RIGHT!  The service is without a doubt southern hospitality!  Vicky Woods was so kind enough to give me a FREE WAFFLE coupon for ONE FREE WAFFLE next time comes back"}
{"text":"Shitty service, bad attitudes throughout the entire staff, rolling eyes, sighs and panting, yelling \"Jesus Christ\" when the cook find out what someone's going to order, seems like no one wants to be there... I don't blame them I hated working in retail food service too but damn you got a job to do. Went in and left within 3 minutes. Not worth the stay and never going back."}
{"text":"Come on. It's Waffle House! Cheap breakfast, doesn't taste awful. For the price, it's awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing! This is the first WH I've been too outside of NM and it was just as good if not better! I usually get the all star special with coffee and a pecan waffle.   Finally bought the mug too! Only 3 bucks!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We were visiting from NY for a few days and were snowed in by the 1/2\" of \"inclement weather\" down here in Charlotte. Our hotel was across the street, so off to Waffle house we went!   The waffles are the best waffles I have ever had in my entire life! The waitresses were wonderful and so was the food. I cannot wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I had the patty melt and hash browns that were smothered, covered, peppered and capped. They make their sandwiches with Texas toast type style bread. The bread is really yummy. The bacon was super crispy- just the way I like it. The food came out very fast. It probably came out in less than 12 minutes. The service was good. My waitress filled up my drink three times before my meal was over without even asking. I'm not a big waffle fan but I will come back to try the pecan waffles because Anthony Bourdain promoted it."}
{"text":"Great service! Awesome chocolate chip waffle. Yummy! Pretty busy on a Sunday morning (which is expected). Parking lot is kind of small but other business is closed on Sundays which opens up parking."}
{"text":"Our server was extremely nice food was good, we  had ordered the waffle combo $7.90 and a sandwich $2.00 .. which is not bad considering we were kinda just looking for some food to grub on after drinks.One thing I didn't like was that  we had two different solicitors ask us for money which is kinda not good for business if you ask me. Great place to eat just bad location thanks though waffle house !"}
{"text":"LaJoy was a rela joy having her as a server! The food here was pretty good, and the place was packed! They (Waffle House) need to come to Washington State!!! This is a very busy location though, so be prepared to wait a little bit to get seated."}
{"text":"My first time here, EVER. We were there super early amd the employees were chatting amongst themselves. The workers are pleasant and accommodating. The menu is vast and very reasonably priced. The location is off the beaten path behind some hotels and that was perfect for me. My to go order was done promptly and when I ate it, I was satisfied. Of course I've forgotten the name of the meal, maybe an all star or something.  It had almost everything,  waffle, grits, egg, bacon. I think they add butter to their grits which is a bonus.  I think the waffles are ok, not great, however I do love that they are NOT Belgian waffles. The next time I'm in the south, I'll go there."}
{"text":"I was disappointed once I got seated. Food was ehh and the cleanliness was not good. Our server was new so the forgetting parts of our meal was explainable but she made it up by getting us to go drinks. I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"We came in and ordered food. It was my daughters first time there. She loved it I would've given a 5 star review but my waffle had a bunch of black hard things in it & our server kept leaving to mess with the jukebox. I've never been ignored for a jukebox before that was a new experience. This was my first time there I usually go to the Waffle House on university & the 101 & I think I'll just keep going there. Bree & Laramie are the best servers ever."}
{"text":"Really bad service. I ordered a chocolate chip waffle and when it came it was a plain waffle with a lot of chocolate chips on top. When I asked the waitress because other waffle houses have the chips inside the batter she said they no longer do it that way here. Grabbed my waffle and threw it away. She then had someone make it with the chips inside the matter. Once the waffle came she said to me I did this for you but doesn't mean someone else will. They had attitudes and did not seem happy that I said anything."}
{"text":"I love my local Waffle House, the food is decent and I love that it's always open. Sometimes the service is really poor though :("}
{"text":"Well, I am absolutely done with this location and I am not particularly motivated to write a negative review; however, and in a nutshell, the location's staff is mostly younger high school aged workers who are supervised by an older person whom appears not to provide sound training.  Everyone is respectful; however,  if this restaurant happens to get slammed, your value as a single customer rapidly gets thrown out of the window.   They do not respect loyalty nor those who pay the bills during the season when things are hot and dead out here!  The food is nothing to write to anyone else about and is below average with other chains in the same family of stores, both in this area, the south, and the Midwestern states that I have personally visited during my lifetime. I won't be returning to this location at all.  I had given this location at least 6 to 7 chances, as it is so close to my home.  Sunday, I was taken back with the uncaring attitude that I perceived was demonstrated by the hostess and manager the morning of my arrival.  I may be dining alone; however, my value is reduced as a single diner and larger tables are reserved for two or more people.  Sounds reasonable, correct? Well, when they are scraping by to find customers during the \"off season\" when many have gone back to their home bases, there is never a problem with seating at that time.  I suggest that it won't inconvenience many with someone who sits alone in a space just to really relinquish this space in the next 10 minutes any way.  But, when every visitor to the area returns to their lives in other states, how much business can be lost by shunning or pushing your regular income customers to the outskirts for those 5 months or so; especially, when they do not return ever again?  In some ways I understand; however, it is the way with which the people in this store, have conducted such business with regulars,  that is crucial to my understanding of this issue.  I was treated very poorly, and shoved to the side, so to speak, because they could not manage their breakfast time patrons adequately.  It is not my fault as I was there for both a meal and I was exceedingly patient, as well.   So, if this is the way in which a regular, solid patron is treated when things are going well for the business (high season with all of the visitors), what then will they do during the slow/hot season when regulars like myself who sustain these businesses,  do not return to eat in their establishments?"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Waffle House staff ever. Everyone was friendly and helpful.  It's Waffle House, so y'know it's not super healthy or gourmet. You aren't here for that are you? No, I didn't think so.  We're all here for the scattered, chunked, etc, etc. hashbrowns of awesomeness.   Food was made perfectly to our order. Delicious coffee."}
{"text":"Branched out to the salad world here at Waffle House. Had my second salad there last night and these things are pretty good if your hell bent on staying healthy and Waffle House is your only option. The chicken walnut apple salad was last night's choice and on top of salad mix was a full grilled chicken breast chopped up and walnuts, some apples I believe, dried cranberry and red peppers also. The one salad dressing they include is never enough, so ask for two, but at $7, this salad is a surprise winner and bargain at the House."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a cheap and delicious meal?  The service is always great.  Love taking my boys here late at night."}
{"text":"The one server was friendly and attentive.  Two stars for her.  The food, however, was not impressive at all.  The Texas bacon sandwich, hashbrowns w/piece of melted American cheese was not good.   Being called The Waffle House, we ordered a waffle ... it was soft and cool in temperature!   And my husband and I were 2 of the only 6 patrons in there!   Go to IHOP or any other breakfast restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at Waffle House this week. Both the plain and the chocolate waffle were so yummy!!! Our waitress, Robin, was the real reason I had such an amazing experience. She was hilarious, helpful, kind, and a genuinely friendly person. Overall, I enjoyed the food and loved the staff. Thank you Waffle House"}
{"text":"I am rarely in Phoenix, so I don't know the best spots, but if you are looking for quick, cheap breakfast foods at any hour The Waffle House is your place. I found that this location had that old style diner feel. You can sit in an open booth or at the counter. The people are very nice. They even yell out your order to the cooks. There is a great friendly atmosphere as you sit in and enjoy your meal. I felt like I was in a scene of Seinfeld. It was great. I would recommend you order the waffles. That is a no brainer"}
{"text":"I grew up with Waffle House and love my browns smothered, covered and chunked.  It did not matter if it was 7am or 2am it was good eatin.  Memories.   Now this one is nasty.  The eggs come with cheese AND eggshells.  The hash browns are not worthy of mention, they should be covered with a garbage can lid.  All in all the food tastes like freezer bought food from the grocery store.  Those waffles?  Let go of my lego quality, did the toaster pop?  My rule of thumb after this experience, always use the restroom first.  If it's nasty so is the food."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is right by my house. They know my whole family by first name! I can go here anytime of the day and they are always happy to see me!"}
{"text":"I am currently here and am receiving the worse service from the worse waitress I have ever encountered....name on tag says PRESCOTT! She asked us if we wanted separate checks or one check, we said separate. She came back with combined checks and the had an attitude when we corrected her and sarcastically said \"it can be fixed.\" We asked for warm syrup, to which she responded Waffle House doesn't do that, but she would ask. She then brought out a cold waffle, so I asked for warm syrup or a hot waffle and she sarcastically responded \"when I receive, you will receive it.\" When she brought the syrup out I noticed her whispering me laughing with two of her colleagues. They would look at me, whisper and laugh. They kept doing it up until the point that I paid my check. The salesperson cashing me out asked if everything was worked out OK for me, I said no not your service, it was horrible. He handed me my change and kept it moving. I look to my left and see Prescott giggling with a the same colleague to which I respond we'll see how funny it is when I post a review and you have no job. I thought to speak with a manager, but Marlene, the manager, just so happened to be one of the colleagues laughing with her. HORRIBLE!!! I will also be sending an email to your corporate office!"}
{"text":"Normally the good is greasy, the service is bad and the place is empty. This location must be broken because the food was yummy, the service was great and there was a 20 min line to get a table. God I love this place."}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly staff, and food is always great!  Been her multiple times and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Worse service I ever seen at any restaurant... rolling eyes and basically giving a \"I don't give a f***\" type attitude. Couldn't catch her name well but it was ethony or ebony idk but it was very bad. Even the workers could tell how it was going and the unit manager step in and gave us the service we should've gotten from the start. It was for a short period which sucked. But ya never again going to this location."}
{"text":"Our first time visiting this Waffle House and it didn't disappoint. There was a wait we we got there which is expected on a Sunday morning. The \"hostess\" seemed flustered with all the people coming. You could tell though that the workers were trying to work, clean tables and seat people who were waiting as fast as they could. The food came out quick and was delicious! Our waitress was very friendly and attentive even for how busy it was."}
{"text":"I wanted a quick dinner but not a burger.  I hadn't been to Waffle House in years since there isn't one close where I live.  Sharlot greeted me when I came in and was super nice and friendly to me and everyone else.    I got breakfast for dinner and they had my food out in just a few minutes.  It was very tasty and price was super cheap.  Grilled biscuits were great but probably not the healthiest thing on the menu."}
{"text":"This is the worst Waffle House I've ever been in. The food was undercooked and doughy, and another waitress told us to go easy on our server because he was new. I know that you don't go to Waffle House for the service, but I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"First time at a Waffle House, love this place. Wish I had come sooner. Wait times were quick even on Sunday/Father's Day. Food was amazing, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This location I've found to be seriously hit or miss. As a truck driver, I am used to the quirks usually found at the \"Awful Waffle\" as we fondly name it, and this location is full of them. The one thing I have noticed is in the past year the business has dropped off dramatically .... which is interesting as there are no less than two trucking companies using nearby hotels for orientation. This \"captive audience\" should be making business boom. It is not a good sign when drivers will not patronize a Waffle House.  My main problem is that a certain team on nights do nothing but gripe and moan about the customers, their coworkers, and life. I also heard a number of very crude comments made on the sexual orientation of several customers. In the meantime my waitress was so busy talking and eating I finally offered to just get my own coffee.  The food was very well cooked both times I stopped in (I did want to give this place the benefit of the doubt), but better for takeout unless you stop in when Jen is waiting tables. Now I look through the window to see who is working before deciding to stop and eat here."}
{"text":"So I was in the area visiting a friend and I saw this place and decided to stop in. As soon as I opened the door I was met with a foul odor. I was greeted by a lady. I wasn't sure if she would seat me or if I sat myself(never visited a Waffle House before) after an awkward silence she said \"ok\" and walked off. I sat down at the bar stools and looked at the depressing placement menu. The same lady can back and asked if she could get me something. I told her I'll just look at the menu for a while. Again this place smells. So I'm already not liking it. From where I am sitting you can see the whole kitchen line. It was a mess. I've been to culinary school and I know how to keep s kitchen. This was dreadful. Dirty pan and utensils thrown about. This place looks outdated, dirty, and it smells terrible. After taking a fake phone call to get out of there I wrote this review. I never got close to trying the food. Maybe I came on a bad day, but I'll never be back anyway because I don't live close. Over all bad atmosphere, awkward service, and food????pass"}
{"text":"Cheap, clean and consistent.  Service is always good.  My husband and I always eat our pie first.   Be mindful this is designed as drunk food, so eating it sober might not agree with your belly right away.   Also, I don't think the soda fountain is cleaned often; it tastes a little funky."}
{"text":"The service wasn't good at all. I had to wait at least 5 minutes for someone to take my order, while the servers were standing around. Finally I ask can someone take my order and was told someone will be with you in a minute. Then when it was time to pay stood at the register for another 5 minutes while the staff conversed with known customers. Again I had to say something before someone check me out. The manager was rude and not very accommodating."}
{"text":"It was ok. My over medium eggs were a little too runny, my hash browns were not very crisp and my toast was cold. I was looking for the dollar menu but couldn't find it. Service was good though."}
{"text":"This is a review to compliment Mary.  She has beautiful silver hair!  This Waffle House was very busy but got us seated so quickly.  Alec was working hard cleaning tables and everyone in the building was hustling.  I was very impressed.   Mary was a great serve and my mom and I loved her!  She was so sweet despite being it super busy she took time to talk to us, joke with us, and ask us how our day was going.  My mom said as we were leaving \"I don't know how they hire people who work so hard for minimum wage. Everyone that worked there was really working hard and everyone made sure to tell us to have a good day. It's amazing really, where do they find people who work so hard?  Businesses kill to find employees who really work hard to give customer service that's fast and efficient.  Waffle House seems to attract hardworking nice employees.\"  So, this is a compliment to the staff of Waffle House.  Thank you Mary and Alec!  They deserve a pat on the back and a raise from management."}
{"text":"This Wafflehouse is right across the street from our house.   We love this place.  The staff is friendly, the food is consistent. They always have apple butter at the table, instead of hoarding it in the back, only to be distributed to people who order raisin toast. The bacon is always perfectly crispy, but not burnt.  I always order the All Star Platter, because it comes with a little of everything. I wish I could make my made at home grits taste like weefy-ho.   It's VERY clean by diner standards. I saw some booths being bused, and they wiped EVERYTHING down.   Our only grievance is how often they run out of chocolate pie. My husband and I, traditionally, start out our Wafflehouse meals with chocolate pie. Don't know why, just always have. However, this location seems to always be sold out (Perhaps we talk about our tradition too often lol) But I'm sorry, Pecan pie just doesn't cut it.   Of course we will be back, we can WALK here, and everyone knows our name."}
{"text":"Been to this particular location multiple times.   Maybe I'm just lucky, but I feel like the atmosphere at this location with both the staff and the patrons is just right.  The staff is chatty enough to keep the place from being boring and the patrons aren't too weird.    It's one of the few locations that will have strawberries instead of candied strawberries for your waffles.  I did have one less-than-positive experience.  I asked for an chicken salad with an egg on top.   For that egg, I'd been charged something like an extra $0.50-something cents in the past, but this time it was around $2.60.  Turns out that the add-on is around $0.50 cents, but a single egg is $2.60-something.  So there's a lifehack tip for ya: ask for an egg as an add-on and confirm it's not $2.60.  My salad came up to $10+ which made me feel like I should have went to IHOP.  But then again, who orders a salad at Waffle House?  My own fault.  If you're not coming for the waffles, get the All-Star meal with grits or a triple-order of hash browns.  It'll fill you up good."}
{"text":"I went to this Waffle House with a friend because it was across the street from the hotel we were staying at and it was 12:30 at night.  The food was consistently good. The service was great. Everything was clean. It was a consistent Waffle House experience."}
{"text":"Half decent waffle house. Walked and and I was greeted right away, grabbed a seat at the bar and also had prompt service. Ordered the all star special with a pecan waffle no toast. I must say this was one of the better all stars I have had. Bacon was cooked just right for me and the eggs were nice and fluffy also got hash browns with jalapeños and cheese and they were cooked perfectly. Coffee was filled on the regular and I ate every bit of my meal. ONLY call out is that I hate when you sit at the bar and you can see a dirty floor in front of the stove... this is common at these joints. I would come again!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm reviewing Waffle House, but here goes.  If you have never been to a Waffle House before, the food is exactly what you'd expect: greasy, unhealthy, and strangely enticing.  I normally wouldn't put Cheese Eggs and Grits at the top of my \"to-eat\" list but few things sound better after a night of drinking.    If you have been to a Waffle House before, the food is exactly the same as you remember.  The only distinction this location possesses is that it is very clean.  Pristine, even.  I don't know if it is always so immaculate, but I was shocked.  I'm used to a Waffle House that looks like an unkempt trailer on the inside, not a passable budget restaurant.    The food is really worthy of only two-stars, but this location gets four because when you eat there, you feel like you must be part of some rare historical accomplishment.  My compliments to the janitor."}
{"text":"So the one rule about Waffle House - don't order and eat the waffles.  Trust me.  I played it safe with a ham & cheese omlette, toast and bacon.  My poor friends didn't know any better and found themselves with a case of \"the bends\" about 2 hours later.  Unfortunately, this was also the only place we visited on our entire stay in NC where the folks working there weren't the least bit hospitable.  Could be they were the only restaurant in a sea of travel lodges and they just get sick of making sh!tty waffles and rubber band hash browns for the general public.  Shoulda brought some granola bars."}
{"text":"I was in need of a place to charge my free cell phone, act all sketchy, and maybe score a glass of water. My destination was obvious. Waffle House, Bell Rd. After combing the parking lot for used cigarette butts, I saw a New Buick drive in, with the driver looking out through the opened sunroof. Who do I see, but Shaquille O'Neal, with actress Natalie Portman at his side. What???? The Big Aristotle, Shac Fu, Diesel, loves Waffle House!  Apparently, he also loves skinny white women, 'cause Natalie and Mayor McShaq looked pretty chummy. All he kept talking about was his golf game. Oh,and Gold Bond Powder. Anyway, they wound up asking the competent and attractive male server to package up their entire order \"to-go\". Following great aplomb, they got back in the Buick,he popped his big head out the sunroof and peeled out of the parking lot. I wasn't too surprised to hear the server exclaim     \"I think that klepto, Natalie stole my Worcestershire Sauce\". I guess old habits die hard. Rock On, Shaq Daddy, and Rock On Bell Rd. Waffle House."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast when staying at the Great Wolf Lodge. The resort meals are pricey. Like most waffle houses, fast and super friendly. Everyone gets greeted with a cheerful hello. Good food, fast friendly service, good prices."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the food here seems to always hit the spot, other than that- this specific location offers crappy service.  I get they're a diner, but they're never busy. Especially busy enough to cut customers off when trying to place their order with suggestions by the server.  First and last time I'm ever coming to this location.  Servers are just rude, rude, RUDE!  Plus, the look and feel of this place seems dirty."}
{"text":"My wife Angie and I were out, little after 11pm, needing to eat. Dropped in the Waffle House in Belmont. Waffle houses....some better others worse than average. We were pleasantly surprised!!!! Bacon was well fried, not too crisp. The delight was the eggs. We both ordered scrambled soft, not a crazy order. But, as we order often we have learned it is rarely done well. Tonight it was excellent.  We will return, enjoyed this visit. Good to know the place can be counted on when needed."}
{"text":"The 4 stars are based on my other Waffle House experiences.  This is a 4-Star Waffle House.  There is an old lady that walks around and massages all of the customers.  Stay away if you dislike people touching you, because she will.  The service is pretty good, but it is sometimes hard to find someone if you need something.  The food is always good, but it seems our order often comes out in shifts and isn't always correct when it first comes to the table....but it is what it is.  And what it is, is good, greasy, Waffle House breakfast!  Yum!"}
{"text":"first visit to any Waffle House and was not sure at all what to expect. i have a friend that visited one in tennessee and raved about it, craving it everywhere he travels. it was our last day in the desert and had gone by several so we decided to check one out and decided on this location as it was closest to our hotel, i got a pecan waffle and a side order of hash brown with onions and mushrooms, wife got a plain waffle and bacon, service was excellent, some of the best we have receiived anywhere. inside was a little divey, kind of a sketchy neighborhood. food was pretty average. i guess i was expecting something larger or a little more decadent. waffle was just a 6-7 inch waffle with pecans in the batter. the food was ok but not so good i would seek it out again."}
{"text":"Customer service was horriable until I got back an demanded my money back.  After the lead server says you ate my food and want your money back.  Y eap have several seats and let the district  manager handle this.....if you don't want items on a special....get them and throw them away.  It takes away from want not waste not.  Waffle House policy is absolutely  ridiculous.  All because I didn't want eggs.  I paid an extra $5..."}
{"text":"It is currently 4:30 am, 3 tables sat, and 3 servers working. We were told to seat ourselves so we sat down, waiting ten minutes before flagging down a server and waited another 5 minutes to get our order taken, then in the middle of taking our order the server says \"hold on I'll be right back I need to go pick up an order in the window\" and walked away. Worst service I have ever had, I will stick to Denny's for my 4:30 am breakfast/dinner"}
{"text":"With Waffle House I guess you have to set your expectations accurately. You know your food will arrive fast and it will be typical greasy spoon type fare. This particular location is a bit hectic and possibly a bit off with respect to consistency of food and service. I guess this may be good if you were hungover, drunk, or just broke and in need of some sustenance. Other than that I would save your three bucks and spend 5 over at The Cracker Barrel as the Waffle at this Phoenix location was more like a flat, soggy, burnt biscuit."}
{"text":"Just go 2 Lo Lo's. Not moved by anything on the menu but the staff were super exellent. Asked 4 cheese on my eggs & grits & they threw SLICED sandwich cheese on it. Terrible."}
{"text":"What do you expect from a lower level Denny's in the south?  I was glad I saw this on our way to the hotel while waiting out Hurricane Irene back to NJ.  I passed a busy highway because Domino's was closed by the time we were settled in.  Mind you, I was amp'd because I grew up in the south and had Waffle House available to me unconditionally the whole time.  And during those times I had it available, I never took advantage, EVER.  It seems as though, whenever I ever needed the Waffle House, it was out of desperation and it always welcomed me with open arms.  In this case, desperation was knocking at the door.  Once I got there, I felt I was in a scene of A & E's \"The first 48.\"  Shady characters were lined up ordering and seated.  I ended up ordering two (thin) steaks, burger, and  eggs.  It took an hour to get my order.  By the time I got everything, they were out of plastic forks and knives.  Thankfully I stopped by the gas station on the way back to the hotel to pick up some Krispy Kreme donuts and R.C. colas, the attendant noticed my Waffle House purchase and handed me some forks and knives.  The burger was good and the steaks were super thin.  Great meal for desperate layover-ers.  If that is even a word.  I know it's not, just saying."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed when I walked in the restaurant   was the employees. They were obnoxiously  loud to the point where the waiter had to tell them to be quiet in order to hear me speak. Then I ordered waffles with peanut butter. This was the best waffle I ever had in the past year. However, the sausage I had with was, \"okay.\" One last thing I loved was the kick pad on the bathroom door so you don't have to push it open with your hand."}
{"text":"Some people love this place and some cant stand it.  I am in the love it catagory.  Dubble waffle and some hashbrowns ill be set. O...So plump..."}
{"text":"I hope this never happens to you, let my story be a warning, always check before you scoot at the Waffle House... and always keep a bottle of hand sanitizer in your car for emergencies.  Ugh, I shutter just remembering.  The patrons of the Waffle House consist of drunks, late-nighters, night laborers, Denny's rejects, and the homeless.  I being of the drunk variety tend to wander in for a waffle in the wee hours of the morning when I'm not in the mood for a grand slam or a monster taco- if you know what I'm saying.  Usually, I get the company of some colorful people and a belly full of waffle, but one night I got a little more.  My friends and I decided to grab a booth near the windows and as I slid onto the bench my hand touched something wet.  I immediately pulled it back expecting to find food on the seat.  When I looked down at my hand it wasn't any sort of waffle excrement between my fingers, it was human excrement- a big ol' loogie.  Yes, someone spat on the seat and not just a little, I couldn't create that monster with an upper respiratory infection.  I just want the culprit to know- I hate you.    As for the food, you will enjoy it if you are drunk, hungry, and your hands haven't been soiled so that you can actually eat it.  Yummy."}
{"text":"The food is really good. Ended up eating at this place back to back for our morning starts. The only set back is it can get a bit pricey cause their combos don't include everything you want so the cost adds up as you add sides. Still worth it though."}
{"text":"Wow the only thing I can say about this place is I think dog food would be a step up. When I walked in I was wondering why no one was in there and now I understand. POOR service with a waitress with a very bad service.  I would recommend locals and visitors  to not keep on passing by. If you do eat here good luck."}
{"text":"The food was great for the very cheap price. The staff was friendly and always came by to check if everything  was good. I must admit go early place get jam pack or maybe because it was a Wednesday"}
{"text":"The waffle house in Cornelius, NC is by far the best serviced cleanest waffle house in NC! The food is prepared better than other waffle houses I've been to. I was impressed by how all the cooks wore gloves & worked as a well oiled machine to prepare my order! Great waitstaff & it was a joy to share a laugh with the manager & the regulars!  You must absolutely try 2 things when you come here: The bacon patty melt plate & the t-bone & eggs! The manager prepared my t-bone to a perfect medium temperature (better than Ruth's Chris!!!) & my sunny side up eggs were membrane free (without me having to request it!)!!!  5 stars across the board!"}
{"text":"my boyfriend has been raving about this place for a while now; so we finally made a stop. they don't have these in San Francisco. first thing I noticed, cheap!!   the waffles were ok.. I like them a little crispy on the outside, but these we're nice and fluffy. still not bad though. \"they're not as cinnamon-y as I remembered them to be\" says the bf.   what was so unhealthily delicious though was the bacon and egg sandwich on jalapeño cheddar biscuit and a side of hash browns!   best junk food breakfast on this Arizona trip!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant and clean place to eat. Not to mention my waiter Mario is at the top of his profession. Good job sir! Good job!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and most likely my last time. Services was good, food was just low quality something like continental breakfast at a hotel."}
{"text":"The service at this location is always horrible. The food is ok but they always screw it up by either forgetting the toast or the bacon or when we ask for raw onions we get cooked onions. Never give refills and last night we had our food 15 min before we even got our drinks in the first place. My husband had to say Uh can we get our drinks over here or what? The waitress was too busy talking on the phone. From what I could tell she was past she shift cuz someone didn't show up. How is this MY problem? The poor lady who came to relieve her got the wrath of my husband when she asked how everything was and he said horrible! Food was eh and the service was pathetic. I keep trying to give this location a chance but they got their last dollar from me!"}
{"text":"Will someone explain why there are no Waffle House's in Cali ?  Usually male waiters suck as they don't pay attention to the small things but this group was on it\"  The food here is so good and greasy. Lol  The place is very clean as the staff was cleaning the entire time."}
{"text":"Double Dee ordered breakfest, chesse eggs with raisen toast and laughed out loud in front of our waitress when I ordered from the childs menu."}
{"text":"Oooooo wee love this place Burt's chills with any meal is good eats service is on point friendly and swift"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Waffle House location in about a year, so as far as I know, things may have gotten better.  The reason I stopped going was that the last time that I went, the waitress was incredibly rude to me, so much so that other guests started looking over at my table probably because they were so disturbed at the treatment I was receiving as well.  The waitress wouldn't look me in the eye, spoke harshly to me, and I had to ask her multiple times to tell me what my choices for soft drinks were.  I am 90 percent sure that this was a racial issue.  I was the only white person in the establishment and I feel that this was almost an attempt to send the message that I wasn't welcome there.  Well, it worked.  I haven't gone back.  I think whoever runs this Waffle House needs to ask him or herself whether this is the kind of reputation he or she wants it to have though."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts i've had, I mean, for diner food."}
{"text":"Nothing like some affordable short order breakfast after a long night out. We frequent this Waffle House very often, and every time the service is always great. Very friendly hostesses/servers, clean tables, and rarely ever a wait over ten minutes even for this tiny location.   Our favorite dish is definitely the All-Star Special. Enough food to feed 2 people for $10? And we can split it?! SOLD!!  Always great food and great service at an affordable price. Definitely our favorite breakfast/hangover food."}
{"text":"My second favorite breakfast spot! Good food and depending on how busy it is you get your food in a timely fashion. Good prices for the amount of food you get is good as well. I love Waffle House!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Not much room inside. It's like a small diner. They have booths for 2 people and they have a couple of booths that fit for 4 people.   My favorite to get is the bacon cheeseburger with hash browns. The chocolate chip waffle is good. They have breakfast & lunch/dinner.   The restaurant is open 24/7."}
{"text":"Today the place is standing room only - it is breakfast hour and the weekend. The aroma of pecan waffles is in the air ...  Food is good - I had steak and eggs with grits. Steak is good - don't have High expectations and you won't be disappointed . It's Waffle House ! Clean restaurant with slamming grilled food . Waitstaff is pleasant and that's half the battle at any restaurant!  I'd recommend it anytime - just keep perspective of where you are !"}
{"text":"Every Waffle House I have been to has the southern style hospitality. You are greeted and tended to at the time of entry. Now WH is no fancy brunch place, people come here for the food not the ambiance. Neither is this place gourmet so don't expect a fancy presentation.  MUST HAVE: dress your hash brown!  POSITIVE: fast, friendly and fresh. Tons of selection and affordable. This particular location is right off the highway, has plenty of parking, pretty spacious and clean NEGATIVE: depending on the location, there may be a long wait."}
{"text":"Took my family to their first Waffle House and they loved it!! From the customer service to the food, everything was great. Alan was our server and he was on point and friendly. Meeca (I believe that was her name) was hilarious and friendly. I didn't get the cooks name but he rocked out on the griddle and was super nice!! I been to several Waffle Houses in different states and hands down this was my best experience. Waffles were golden and fluffy, eggs cooked perfectly and my covered grits were a special high light..California dont know about grits like these lol"}
{"text":"This is on the lower end of Waffle Houses I've dined at across the country.  The restaurant was full from the \"hungover\" crowd from New Year's Eve, but I feel that the management team needed to be better prepared.  There was a wait list, but it wasn't being maintained very well and most parties were seating themselves regardless of their position on the list.  The food took at least 30 minutes once it was ordered and one of my two dining companions found two hairs in her food.  The waitress (who was trying very hard with the busy crowd) was nice enough to take her breakfast sandwich off the order, but the damage had been done.  My friends were soured on ever returning to a Waffle House, which is a true shame because it really is a fantastic place to get breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late dinner and decided to have their large breakfast meal. The waitresses were very friendly and the service was pretty fast--probably because it was late in the evening--after 9:30p. I only gave it three stars because the eggs were a little runny even though I asked for they over-easy. The ham was a little over-cooked also. Everything else (waffle, grits, toast) were ok. I'm sure they would have corrected the problem if I would have asked but I decided not to."}
{"text":"We in California do not have Waffle House.  My wife and I love WH waffles... Belgian waffles do not compare to the excellent size, thickness and flavor.  Yes, we like the thinner style, not the thick Belgian style.  We missed WH waffles so much, we drove to Phoenix, AZ just to have breakfast at the Waffle House.  I know that sounds extreme, but we did.  I have to thank Jim, the owner, for his hospitality, conversation, generosity and the people he hires to work for him.  We had an outstanding breakfast and when that itch comes up again, we'll do it again."}
{"text":"Wasn't happy with the service.....or lack of.  It wasn't everyone (thank you to young lady that asked if I wanted anything and the one who apologized), but one specific server who made the experience negative.  In the area visiting but I know I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"This Waffle House appeared dirty down to the dishes. The employees could need some serious help on professionalism and what's appropriate behavior in a restaurant. To top it off the food was not so good either."}
{"text":"ew. i will never go back. just thinking about my experience makes me want to vom."}
{"text":"The food is good,staff is very nice. The place is old but it will do. There is temporary parking for large vehicles on the street. The place is small but nice. The location gives you easy access to interstate."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want to be ignored. Waitress brought our food and never came back. Had to even go ask for our check!! Sad to because the only place that got crispy bacon right. Gave this place a second try and got the same service."}
{"text":"On one of my regular visits to Arizona, my Girlfriend took me to this wonderful hidden gem!  I say this as a compliment \"It's a great greasy spoon of a place!\".  It is small, portions are big, it is no frills, takes you back in time to some old TV diner shows.  If you love a great greasy spoon and aren't to stuck up and all white glove type of person, then you must visit here!"}
{"text":"As usual, you can't go wrong with the Waffle House!  Too bad we don't have these in SoCal!  While basic Faroe, the Waffle House food and Staff are terrific. A great experience."}
{"text":"Good customer service. Food was good and fresh. The only thing I didn't like the way the hash browns were made. It was too oily and had a strong oily smell. It smelled like a strong canola oil. Not sure. Either way, the smell was just too oily. It tasted good, but could have been better. Their coffee was great. They are not greedy in regards to coffee. The sizes are big. Love it. As I said the only downside was the oily part. Otherwise, it is a good place"}
{"text":"This Waffle House is the closest to my how so it's the main one I visit. It's does a pretty good. Job. I never have to wait too long and the staff is friendly.  I always get the same thing and it always come out perfect!  Last time I went was so good I finally had to write a review! We went late one night and it had a couple tables in there with most people getting to-go food. I like that they had police in front because we know how late night eating spots in this area could be, so thanks for keeping us safe!   I switched up and tried their new philly cheese-stake bowl. Hash browns covered with steak and cheese, yum! I added jalapeños to it because I like an extra kick and y'all it was GREAT! All our food came out hot and no long wait for a waffle( we tend to order a meal that comes with waffles and numerous times it had came out much later). To make it even better before our food came out a group came in and sat at the counter. I guess the staff found out it was one of their birthdays and started singing a church version of Happy Birthday! IT WAS EVERYTHING! the ladies in there was killing it at 1:30am! The entire staff sang for her for like 4 minutes and our food still came out fast! You can't beat service like that! Please keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Servers take your order accurately and make many efforts to repeatly tell the cooks but the cooks are either too old to retain or hear the order.  Could NOT get it right.   Go somewhere else if at all possible but if you must then be patient and don't expect to get what you ordered."}
{"text":"Went here back when I lived in FL. I used to love it! Saw this while in AZ and was really excited. Had their infamous Hash Browns. They are well known for their Diced, Covered, & Smothered Hash Browns, but now they include Chili, Shrooms, & Jalapenos on top. Decided to have everything on it. It was ok, nothing to write home about. Honestly this dish needed more cheese. Their coffee was awesome. Price was right, the dish was only $3.99!"}
{"text":"Good service, nice staff, but they can never get my hash browns right. Every time I come here they forget the topping. Watch out ordering chocolate chip waffles. Last time all I got was a puddle of chocolate in the middle of my waffle."}
{"text":"I eat at the Waffle House  periodically.  But this location profiles clients.  When arriving to the waffle house we were given a regular menue.  Then I noticed all the ither customers were getting the all you can eat menu.   When I askes the waitress for the all you can eat menu she ignored me.  So I thought she didn't hear me and asked her again.  It was very obvious that she didn't want me to order off that menu.   They were only for certain customers.   So we left and I hear the waitress say she was rude.  Really!!!  If you haven't noticed we are in the 20th century.   Were that traylor trash hillbillies bull isn't excepted anymore. I won't be.back shame on you."}
{"text":"They're food is good and they are relatively quick about serving. However, the employees were loud at times and even cussed at some points."}
{"text":"Okay let's start by saying the place is filthy dirty. When I walked in 2 waitresses were sitting at the bar eating. I ordered 3 eggs, double order hash browns, sausage patties, and a waffle that was supposed to come out last (when I was done eating other food). While I was waiting for my food a guy and girl walk in with plastic cups of beer. Yes beer!  More quality clientele. First out was.....you guessed it, my Waffle!  I reminded her that I didn't want it until after my other food. Next up was was my 2 eggs. Although I ordered 3 eggs at this point I just wanted to eat. Also didn't get my sausage until I was done with all my other food. I suppose they thought I ordered the sausage as dessert. Finally my Waffle came and it was like 3/4 of a waffle. I guess they didn't put enough batter on the waffle iron and when it came out looking like a deflated basketball she thought \"good enough\". By this time I'm ready to pay. But couldn't pay because the beer drinking couple were complaining they didn't get enough syrup in their to-go cups. And you know what???? I LOVE IT!!!  Waffle House is the second best place to eat on the planet!!!  Great food!  Cheap!  Great people watching!!!  LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Over the weekend visit to AZ I had nothing but corporate stores and in my attempt to try something that didn't look familiar we came here for a quick breakfast only to find out it too was a chain that I just didn't know about so much for that idea. Got cheese eggs, toast, grits, and a waffle with coffees. Cheese was a Velveta type flavored egg, toast and grits solid ad waffle ok too. 10 times better than the Denny's meal the day before but overall greatness just OK. Solid cheap regular not healthy breakfast period."}
{"text":"I love that you always get greeted every time you enter the restaurant (actually at any Waffle House location)! The food is consistent and always delicious. Staff is friendly and hospitable."}
{"text":"My experience here; They did not even give us any menus for 20 minutes, then when they did, it took them another 20 minutes to come back and take our order. Mind you, the restaurant was only, if only, half full. Then the cup that they gave me my milk in was dirty. The orange juice was watery. The food was alright. The people could have been just a smidge friendlier rather than grouches!"}
{"text":"Everything was very sweet and very filling. Our waitress was nice, but service was a little slow and had a few miscommunications throughout the experience."}
{"text":"I had a non-professional  experience at this restaurant. I took my grandson out to brunch at the Regent Parkway Waffle House on April 29, 2017.  After 10 minutes I asked the workers about cleaning the table and giving us water and silverware.  A young lady by the name of Nicole came to take our order. I found out later that she was the manager. She brought the water and silverware (no straw)to our table.  We gave her our order. She told us to hold on, that it would be there soon.  A young man came back to our table without the food we had ordered. He stated  \"that she,(Nicole) had forgotten what we ordered\"(although she was writing on the order pad). He proceeded to ask us for our order again. Might I say, there was no apology given.   When the order finally arrived, it was not the food that I'd ordered. Nicole came back to the area only to pass us without a word. She instead got her coat and left.   I would have left the restaurant also, but my grandson was excited about me taking him out to eat.  I must mention Jay, the cook. He was more polite than Nicole, the manager. He apologized and gave me the correct order.   The other gentleman that took our order gave me the impression that he was being trained with no one training him. He served the food and worked the cash register. In spite being given the challenge of both jobs, he was very polite.  I vow to never step foot back in that restaurant again. My grandson who is 10 years old felt the same way.  By the way, there were  only three tables that had to be served at this time (3pm). All other tables and counter were empty.   I heard the customer behind me say \"lousy service\". If I could've  given a ZERO star rating I would've done so. This restaurant did not deserve more than that."}
{"text":"Apparently I've been to this location before. Since we don't have a Waffle House in California, I always make it a point to go to one if I can.  Love the fact that they are open really early. Even at 5:45am they were starting to get pretty busy.   Our waitress was really nice and helpful. The prices are decent. You get so much food for the price. I didn't have room for the \"all the way\" hashbrowns so I ordered it to-go.  Will definitely come to this location again."}
{"text":"Pretty bad when you get your check before you even get all the food you ordered. We didn't even have water yet!  We didn't get our drinks until the end of our meal and when we sent them back because we were through with the meal and on our way out, the server rolled his eyes and another yelled \"wooow\" repetitively as we were leaving.   There was an intoxicated homless man leaning over onto our table talking very loudly. Not wanting to be rude my boyfriend tried talking to the man only to realize he could not carry on a conversation due to \"too many beers that morning\" is what he told us.  The staff did nothing as this carried on for 20 minutes until the server finally came back with our drinks, which were sent back and then we promptly left.  Needless to say we will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.. staffs come and goes.. Few good ones and some shouldn't be in the service industry.. but over all, it's somewhat consistent. Food is alway on point.. place are kept pretty clean.. On any given day it's never too crowded.. that's what I like!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Everyone always raves about waffle houses.   Personally I think it was \"typical\" diner food. I would prefer going to Denny's for breakfast.   The inside has that Diner feel, bar seating where they cook right in front of you.   Our waitress was very odd.  She walked up to our table and just stood there... Never asked us if we were ready.  It was our first time there, so we needed more than 15 seconds to look at the menu. Oh well, can't expect tip top service from a Diner.   Found it kind of strange they only take cash.  What business in today's age doesn't take cards? Especially a chain.   Oh well"}
{"text":"Love the food but wanted to write this to say that while I was here the cook, 'Jonathan' I think, was really rude to my nice server David and I could hear it from my table. Go David you rock! :)"}
{"text":"Waffle Warehouse  I know Arizona is littered with these amazing little breakfast joints (open all day) but it was my first visit ever to a Waffle House and I gotta tell yah, it wasn't too shabby.  Sure being in AZ can be a tad daunting when you find yourself walking into a yummy smellin' restaurant to find yourself being stared at by all the white folk patronizing & workin' (besides the single black male waiter, everyplace gotta have one). I didn't think that Arizona had too much of a white supremacy following...then again their everywhere! But I digress..  Even though they got my order pretty much wrong, it was still mighty yummy (I got a small biscuits and gravy and hash browns with a lot of trimmin's). Service was courteous and food was pretty fast as well. Here's a few things you might like (or not)...  Highlights & Low-lights:  *Old fashion joint filled with locals & cranky old men workin' the grill (how else would you have it?!) *Old school way of shoutin' the order to the cooks and gettin' the food out ASAP- no computers here *Can't complain about the service *2-9pm all you can eat with all the favorites from the menu *Hash brown heaven! Cheese, jalapenos, mushrooms, chili, onions, ham, options *Budget friendly and pretty tasty  Good stuff! I guess that's why their all over the dang place."}
{"text":"I went down to Phoenix for Spring Training and ran across this place in the middle of no where.   Waffle in the name of the joint and I love breakfast food so why not?  Went in there first thing I saw was a Lamborghini outside the Waffle House, and my friends claimed they just saw Amare going into it.  I was too slow to confirm this nor could i get a camera out so oh wells, but if rich people will eat here, why not an average joe like me?  The place is a bit small, I wouldn't bring a group of 5 or more since none of the table can be together.   The wait wasn't horribly long, about 5-10 mins.  When we sat down the waitress was prompt with the menu and gave us some time to order which is rare in a quick serving food joint that's packed.  I got the Special which consist of a giant waffle, 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and 3 bacon/sausages for 8 bucks.   You order this with the warm syrup and bam instant gratification.      1 star for the food, 1 for the service, 1 for cleanliness (for a diner setting), 1 ease of parking/location"}
{"text":"It's in the ghetto, but if you don't mind people being loud and yelling across the restaurant, this is one of the better Waffle Houses I've been to, and I've been to many throughout the south east. The waitress was very polite and attentive. She never let our glasses get empty. The cook, well, he was in a class all his own. Every item we were served was cooked go absolute perfection. My wife is very particular and makes a lot of special request, who h usually causes at least a few mistakes. I always ask for my waffle cooked light with my all star breakfast, which I rarely get. The cook here hit every mark we set. Given the chance, I would absolutely go back.   The only reason I only gave 4 stars, not 5, is I prefer a quiet atmosphere. This place was loud even for a waffle house, especially since the weren't many people  there."}
{"text":"It is a Waffle House.  I enjoyed my meal.  It arrived hot.  The service was great. The restaurant clean. Yeah!  Waffle House."}
{"text":"LOVE Waffle House. Best people watching and reliable food for a little greasy spoon diner. I wish we had one in Vegas, but will visit every chance i get. Food is always reliable, love those waffles and hash browns."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Service is so so. Prices are fair. The all you can eat is awesome. Cherry sprite is what I usually drink here."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Fairfield Inn just steps away and caught a meal after a day of drinking and horse racing. Love that they are open 24 hours and menu has whatever you want. Friendly staff and very clean. Mary cooks a mean breakfast."}
{"text":"Gotta love waffle house... Butvthis one is special.... The cooks make your food the way you like it.... And everyone is very friendly!"}
{"text":"The welcoming aroma of good ole breakfast and friendly smiles made me feel right at home! Shannon was a delight and such a hard worker. Mrs.Sue was a chef momma must have sent with that just perfectly done plate. The atmosphere and energy kept me comfortable and at ease. I had a few hours to kill as i waited on my car....this was the perfect place! The fellas were hard at work and very respectful.  Mr.Antonio  arrived to supervise but dove right in sweeping the parking lot. This team was impressive to watch and i will return again & again! #QueenCitysFinest"}
{"text":"Visiting from California my friend insisted that we come here since Phoenix is a second home to her. I can't even say how thankful I am for her showing me this place. It's a small spot, probably one I wouldn't normally go to without recommendation. Shelly was our server and she was so nice! By the end of the meal she became a mama to all 4 of us! Not only was she caring but she was on top of everything and helpful with the menu! Her alone can be 5 stars!  The food though... is on another level! AMAZING! I'm so mad that the day before we went to Denny's when we could of came here.  My friends got sandwiches which they loved and I had the hash brown bowl w/ cheese, sausage and OM eggs. Lord have mercy!! That was probably the best breakfast I've ever had! The waffles are so freaking good. I can't even! I'm devastated that we don't have this place here thank you mama Shelly for incredible service!"}
{"text":"After a night out with the guys, a few of us stopped in for early early breakfast. I wasn't that hungry so I enjoyed a few slices of toast. I was craving coffee so enjoyed a few cups with cream. Great conversation over greasy delicious food and great service. This early morning will definitely be one to remember -- awesome memories. Thanks so much! Cheers***"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a late lunch.  The food was prepared quick and the service was great. Would def recommend this location.  This is the second time I have been at this location. It was a few months ago but now I can say for both visits the food and service is outstanding."}
{"text":"I do believe this is the westernmost Waffle House in the US.  Don't be confused by my 4 star rating. Waffle house is not going to make delicious waffles that you could imagine King Leopold of Belgium eating. The eggs are never going to make Alice Waters, Charlie Trotter or Thomas Keller smile and reminisce of a simpler time.   Waffle House is great because it is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I don't think the employees even know where the keys to the locks are. Don't even think of going to Waffle House unless it's between 11pm and 6am, but during those hours, that's when Waffle House deserves it's 4 stars."}
{"text":"The best server in the world works here and her name is Mary...she is so funny, friendly and outgoing."}
{"text":"Excellent service- our waitress kept checking on us and was super nice- excellent Food! It's my first time here- I had eggs w hash browns, toast and a waffle on the side and it was all good! I usually don't eat/touch the hash browns, but I finished all of them today!"}
{"text":"Came here last saturday morning at 2am. My bf and our friends finished drinking at the bar and everyone wanted to eat here. My bf and I never been here before but we went for fun. We got there and looked at their menu. Very cheap I thought so the food might be semi good. I order just hashbrowns with cheese and my bf got a blueberry waffel. We got our food and to my surprise the food was actually good. My bf liked his waffel and my hashbrowns were yummy too. The food wasnt good because we were drunk (we sober by now) the food was actually tastey and not gross. Plus the workers were really nice even though they were dealing with other weirdos at this time. We are totally coming here for normal time breakfast."}
{"text":"One of my oldest and dearest friends is in town visiting his family and called me at 2:30am asking if I wanted to meet up for a cup of coffee & conversation. I suggested this Waffle House. As always, the coffee was hot, delicious & fresh. We shared a breakfast wrap, eggs and waffles. Server was awesome and the food arrived quickly -- food was yuumilious. I can always count on Waffle House to be there for me when I'm in need of comfort foods and sharing times with good friends. Thanks, Waffle House!"}
{"text":"Mom and dad really like Waffle House. The food is tasty and fresh. I like the raisin toast and cheesy eggs."}
{"text":"One of the best Out of State breakfast in AZ.  Very small inside,  but fast service."}
{"text":"A few years ago, I took a trip to Phoenix as a thank-you gift from a client.  Hey, win a $330,000,000 case, get a free weekend trip to Phoenix.  Who knew?  What was the highlight of the trip?  The fantastic hotel?  Nope.  The multiple free rounds of golf in the middle of February?  Nope.  The adoration of my client, who owed their entire continued corporate existence to my courtroom magic?  Oddly, nope.  Waffle House?  You got it!  The Mason-Dixon line can also be called the IHOP-Waffle House line.  North of the line, IHOPs abound.  South of the line, Waffle Houses flourish.  Given my choice, I'd take Waffle House every time.  Here's why.  1.  Everything on the menu can be added as a side order to anything else.  Want bacon and eggs?  Fine.  Want to add 1 pork chop to that order?  $1.99 more.  Want to add 2 pork chops to that order?  $2.99 more.  And so on, all the way up to 6 pork chops.  Same story if you want to add a t-bone (higher price, but still).  So, you can literally start with bacon & eggs and end up with a 15,000 calorie buffet-buster, and still be out....maybe....$10.  2. The waitresses don't fark around.  They keep the water and diet Pepsi coming, call me \"hon,\" and get the job done.  Plus, the check comes with the meal, which saves me time when the ambulance arrives to take me to the ER for an emergency stomach pumping.  3. No reservations required.  Listen, I can eat New American food till the cows come home.  But sometimes, you just need a little old fashioned Low American.  Traditional.  And Waffle House fits the bill."}
{"text":"Brought my son to this Waffle House for lunch. The staff were all friendly. The waitress was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. Another waitress was mopping the floors, since it wasn't busy at the moment. The cook even came to ask if our hash browns were cooked to our liking. This is a pleasant surprise, as many Waffle Houses aren't as clean and friendly as they once were."}
{"text":"This is the closet Waffle House to Las Vegas, so I was excited to stop by as I frequent WH in Georgia. I got the pork chops, which were meh. Typically they are my fav but was lacking flavor. The waffle however was delicious as always! Great service as well. Our server was so sweet. I give it 3 stars because it was extremely warm inside and many flies and bugs near our window. But you can go wrong for the amount of food you get for the price. It was extremely busy as well, as expected. Lots of college students since its near ASU. We waited about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Finally hit up Waffle house.  You get a crap ton of food for a low price.  It was mediocre, but it is waffle house.  What did I expect? The positive was it was cheap, the staff was singing and having a good time, and there were a lot of regulars interacting with the workers.  The con is that it is waffle house."}
{"text":"Walk into this place and the little girl that was seating the guests looked like she hated her life. She attempted to sit us at the bar stools and gave a shitty face when the guests behind us also wanted to sit in a booth. As she went to clean the table from some guests that were leaving, she noticed another guest was walking in and made the motion of blowing her head off. You need to be fired... I cleaned my seat since it wasn't done."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place they are having a Christmas party for their employees and employees gawker children and Santa Claus is here. What more could a person ask for this is absolute Nirvana."}
{"text":"My Waffle House excursion was the result of jokingly saying \"Let's go there\" and then somehow being taken seriously. Literally feet from the front door and I was ready to turn around. In case you were wondering what happened to the cast of Dangerous Minds with Michelle Pfeifer and Coolio, look no further; I've found them.   After about ten minutes of trying not to stick to the menus, our waitress walked over and said \"You ready?\" But I wasn't ready because I was too busy trying to figure out what on the menu couldn't be made by a five-year-old with an EZ-Bake oven. Everything is a variation of grilled cheese, except for the waffles which I daringly tried because the pictured portion looked plentiful and I figure, if I have to go to a Waffle House, might as well try the namesake.   After what I can only imagine was five minutes spent microwaving a frozen waffle, I was given a plate of grid-like moosh and a plastic packet of butter resting atop it. I HATE when people put things that they've touched with their hands on my food, but at this point I just wanted to eat and leave before the utter disdain imprinted on my face upset one of the Wrestlemania fans sitting behind me.  I can't NOT recommend this place enough. It's on par with Denny's in terms of pricing, but you don't even get what you pay for. And you might get stabbed."}
{"text":"They charge you 10% for a TO-GO fee which is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. They said it was to cover the cost of plates and silverware.. what... I have never heard of having to pay for what to put my food in. This policy needs to be changed."}
{"text":"Oh boy, where do I start?  Firstly, the table had been wiped down, but was still very wet and not at all clean.  The menus were filthy.  Food, grease, and smudges of \"I don't know what\" were all over both of them.  We ordered decaf and had to wait for it to brew (not really a big deal, but you pay $2.20 per cup, then get to enjoy it for half of your meal).  We both ordered a two egg breakfast, which was supposed to come with toast, or biscuit and hash-browns or grits.  One of us ordered a biscuit and grits, the other hash-browns and a biscuit with added gravy.  We also ordered one waffle to split.  So first, two plates come out with a biscuit and gravy on each, then two cups of coffee show up.  Next comes a thin, cold and rubbery waffle.  About 5 minutes later one plate comes with two eggs, toast, and grits and another with two eggs, toast, and grits.  No hash-browns.  So they had added a  side of biscuits and gravy to each plate and just assumed we wanted the toast.  I ordered hash-browns, not grits.   So they take back my plate and scrape my eggs onto a little plate and bring them back, then after a few more minutes, and after my eggs have become cold, a little plate with some hash-browns shows up.  To top it off, the biscuits tasted like they were cooked in old, burnt grease left after popping popcorn.  I will say they comped our meal, but I would much rather have skipped the whole mess and gone to McDonald's or something.  The waitress was very nice, but I don't think she had been properly trained.  Beware..."}
{"text":"From my Army days, party days, till today Waffle House will hold a place in my heart.  The price and 24/7 breakfast will always keep ppl coming. The small tight knit restaurants, \"salespersons\", ppl yelling Mark, will have them coming back. I have seen rich people and poor alike come together in this place and I always feel comfortable."}
{"text":"With a foul, noisome smell immediately upon arriving , I was ready to leave, but comradery with a coworker  required just a change in seating to palliate the icky and disgusting smell.  Off to a bad start, I ordered just a lonesome pecan waffle. And for six dollars, you can't go wrong.  Portioned as \"not too big, not too small,\" my meal was over relatively quickly as I was in a rush.   Coterminous with dennys, IHOP or other breakfast franchises, you get what you pay for, and without any fear of sinking your wallet"}
{"text":"So came in waitress by the name of TJ, told us that she can't take our order right away.. and will be with us shortly.. 5 mins later 4 people walked in and there order was taken right away by another waitress with red hair.. named Chris? and when I asked her if she could take my order .. she said yeah, she thought TJ took it and will place my order first before the 4 customers.. next thing we know as Chris was taking my order.. Tj said to Chris to call out the other first and that she didn't care that me and my family came first.. after hearing that.. I will never be returning to this location..."}
{"text":"My hubby and I frequent this Waffle House, usually late at night. Most of the time I'd give this place 4 stars, not 5 because they always forget something on our order. But yesterday was a disaster. We went around 1pm and it was pretty packed. We ordered our sodas and our food. When my husband's soda arrived it had stuff floating in it. When we received our order it was missing country gravy on both our hashbrowns. Our waitress, I believe her name is Monica, fixed it. My cheese for my hashbrowns wasn't melted, at all. I asked for ham in my hashbrowns and she didn't even write that down, so I didn't have any ham in my hashbrowns. When she dropped off our food she gave us the check as well. We didn't see her after she dropped off our food. I pay $2.10 for a beverage with refills, I got one tiny cup, mainly ice, and no refills because our waitress never came back to our table. I had to go up to the cash register to get my own to go boxes because our waitress was MIA. When I told the lady at the cash register about our missing server and the horrible service her response was \"I'm sorry, that'll be $23.87\". HORRIBLE customer service today!"}
{"text":"It was packed but they are super friendly and their lemonade is made fresh every shift! Our pork chops and hash brows were really good! We've been to many in the country and this is one of the best ones!"}
{"text":"The first question I ask myself almost daily, is WHY IS THERE NOT A WAFFLE HOUSE IN NEVADA?  Arrived in Charlotte around 1am and we were famished. Someone in our travel party had been raving about Waffle House from before we even touched down at the airport, so of course we had to try it.  There was a minimal wait even at that hour. This meant that the atmosphere or food was legit, and my assumption was correct. The juke box music is cranked, and the cooks are serving up deliciousness. It is styled like a diner, with the hometown atmosphere that I like. I can appreciate a simple breakfast meal, and this place definitely delivered.   I had OJ, chocolate milk, a large waffle, sausage, grits AND an omelet that I got to choose what items I put in it. DELICIOUS, and hit the spot. Because breakfast is one of my favorites, I constantly find myself longing for a waffle house here in Nevada."}
{"text":"This was my first time experiencing The Waffle House and I must say it totally sucked! Bacon over cooked sausage overcooked tasted like the meat was already pre-cooked and then all they did was just reheat it on the grill the only thing that I say that I love the most or was the Grits but I do not see myself going to another Waffle House again for breakfast to me the food taste was just not worth it!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat, management could use a few classes in customer service. Food is good thanks to the cooks service is good thanks to the waitresses. Management needs to learn who pays the bills."}
{"text":"Going in here, I wasn't expecting a fabulous experience, after all, it is a cheap place to grab a quick bite to eat. The restaurant was full, and the staff seemed stressed out and hurried. It took a minute to get seated, and around 20 to get seen to order. That was a minor annoyance. The waitress was busy laughing with her coworkers, which I've done before when I worked a customer service job, but never in view of customers, openly ignoring them. I was disappointed that I didn't get offered refills and my order was wrong. It took a bit to get a to-go box as well. I'm normally a patient easygoing person, because I've worked numerous customer service jobs before, so I won't yell or raise a fuss, because I've been on the opposite side of the counter. Don't eat here, find somewhere else to go. The food, once I got it re-ordered, was excellent and filling, as always. The service left a bit to be desired however."}
{"text":"First time visiting Waffle House. The food was very inexpensive and very tasty. My server was very sweet and attentive. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I went to the Waffle House the other night with my boyfriend and a few of his friends. The waitress (she had pink hair) was super sweet and very attentive. She had our drinks within 5 minutes of us getting there and the food didn't take long to arrive, especially since had a big group of people. The food wasn't bad either it was pretty good. My only issue was that my eggs tasted like the had soap in them. I think they may have not gotten rid of all the soap when washing the dishes which I didn't finish. Was too bad because the cook made them to perfection. That's the only reason why I'm giving it a 3 stars."}
{"text":"First time to a Waffle House ever and I loved it...I was expecting burnt sloppy food but found it to be better than other breakfast places. Will be back with my kids to sit at the counter next time."}
{"text":"Breakfast here yesterday.  The waiter, Danny, was new but very nice even though he messed up my order.  I didn't bother to tell him and ate it anyway.  Had a lite waffle for $2.75.  It was the softest, mussiest waffle I have ever had but tasted amazing.  I also got the regular size hashbrowns ($1.60) with sauteed onions (.25) and cheese (.30).  What I had wanted was hashbrowns with onion and mushrooms.   Everything tasted good though and was a decent size.  I will go back because both breakfast and lunch/dinner are served 24 hours a day and the food is downright CHEAP.  A grilled cheese sandwhich is less than $2, ect.  An easy place to take the kids."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing very homey very happy the wife and kids always love it breakfast at its best simply easy and quick"}
{"text":"The diner from Georgia that made it real real real real real big and branched out all over the south and is slowly but surely making its way north and east. I'm still envious that Michigan doesn't have one of these gastronomic institutions. The alter ego of HiHOP. The better one if as far as I'm concerned.  We ordered the t-bone steak combo, one for each. I ended up with the short end of the stick since for some reason, that day we walked in, was the day they only had one t-bone steak left. So, no big deal,,, fiance' get's the better cut. I'll just settle for the sirloin. Which if cooked properly, as it was, medium rare is still a pretty good cut of meat. hashbrowns with mushrooms and texas toast for the win. Pair that up with a hot cup of coffee and I am a very happy camper.  The place was really nice and orderly. We seem to have walked in right before their dinner rush, so It was very empty. We did get primo seats at the bar as well. Plus, we were pretty much the only customers at the time, so we did get their full undivided attention.  I had a great meal here, specially the fact that we were driving back to Detroit from Pennsylvania. Yes,, long drives can definitely work up an appetite.  Thank you so much Waffle House. You guys rock!!!"}

{"text":"Waffle House is Waffle House. Of course you don't expect it to be fancy but it's cheap good eats.   This particular location is clean. They clean off the tables and sweep the floor/area before seating the next party.  I went on Sunday around 11:45 and was seated in about 15 minutes. It took about another 15 minutes for the food to be served.  The location at this time was busy but they kept it things moving along.  If you're in the area and looking for a traditional breakfast diner experience stop on by."}
{"text":"For a Waffle House, this place is great. It's a newer location, the staff is friendly and the kitchen is clean. The cooks get the food in and out quickly even if there is only one cook and a restaurant full, they do well.  I wasn't much on the Waffle House craze but my boyfriend loves it for any occasion. It's becoming a trend for us. I don't hate it. It's easy to get in and out of the parking lot and only a short distance from some of the local bars if you're looking for late night. Still a family friendly place even later."}
{"text":"As others have said, it's a Waffle House and you need to base your expectations accordingly. HOWEVER, the staff here was AWESOME when they were short handed and slammed on Mother's Day. Once seated, they got our drinks out quick and kept checking in. We were in the loop on where our order was (behind 2 x mega-take out order) and they apologized to us for the wait. When they missed an item from our order, it was taken off no questions asked. They called in what looked like a manager-type / off duty bouncer to help expedite orders and food began to fly out of that kitchen. I'm impressed, really. I get less attention and care from \"better\" restaurants and this place needs some respect. Good work to the crew on Sunday morning! Recommended."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Got sat, after 15 minutes nothing. Server kept saying he'd be back with me, but take another tables order before the even sit down. Guess you have to be buddies with these guys. Breakfast supposed to be fast. Even watched them seat a walkin over someone who was waiting. Guess they take reservations! Not too friendly!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst Waffle House ever!!! The service is slow the food is cold & the staff is rude!!! I'm never going back. The District Manager has even attempted to call me & offer me a gift card or a free meal & I have turned him down... This place is horrible!!!"}
{"text":"An average Waffle House but I will say that this one is MUCH cleaner and has friendlier staff than the one off Tyron by IKEA."}
{"text":"Roaches roaches and again ROACHES!!  This used to be my favorite local Waffle House. It's in a good area and it's always fairly quiet even on the weekend. Last night December 26, 2015 I took 2 of my daughters for an easy dinner. I walked in and was a little surprised. The restaurant wasn't near as clean as it used to be... We were in the middle booth on the bathroom side of the restaurant. I was facing the restrooms. Before we even received our drinks I saw a roach crawl from the back into the open and eventually scurry into the women's restroom. Unnerved, we ordered and our food arrived quickly. Half way through I saw another roach, yes a different roach as this one was slightly smaller and more red. I decided at this point I had had enough and was ready to leave and go shower. Pat, our waitress took my payment and as I went back to the booth to roust my daughters we all saw a roach crawling on the cooler door where the pies are stored! 3 separate different roaches in a matter of 45 minutes in the same restaurant. I WILL NEVER BE BACK. I hope they shut the place down and drown it in insecticide. I grew up in Georgia, in Waffle House's home market and a WH on every other corner... NEVER EVER even in the ghetto or the most back woods of Waffle Houses have I ever encountered a roach issue like that."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and the food was really good, but the service was horrible! Our waitress was rude, and forgot part of our order after she took forever to bring our food out"}
{"text":"Gia the owner is really cool I can see she is focused on her business. Kiki was the server she was so nice and the food came out in under 7 minutes!!!! Great food"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and attentive.  We were a party of four and each had eggs, hash brown, ham or bacon, toast and a waffle.  Food was good. However, I expected more of their \"waffle\", afterall, its in their name.  Waffle was a little underdone for my liking and there wasn't anything that stood out as far as taste.   We were entertained by their digital jukebox with Kenny Rogers singing tunes about the restaurant....\"only at the wafffllleee hoooouusssee\" and \"raaaaaisin tooooast\"  I did like their thick coffee mugs and bought one as I left for $5"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible I also watched them also make the food and it appeared to be what some would call \"unsanitary\". Definitely eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went here late last night after a concert. It was a happy, unexpected find. The prices were good and the breakfast was so yummy! I can honestly say I've never had a restaurant meal taste as close to a home-cooked one in my life. The cheese eggs, bacon and raisin toast hit the spot. We sat at their little bar and you can see them cooking right in front of you. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"You always know what you will get, tasty food quickly. There is usually a wait for a table for breakfast, but if you don't mind the counter, you should have no trouble sitting quickly. I don't eat breakfast, but my girls do, and I love their coffee."}
{"text":"Well let's say I Was not very impressed with this place at all ... the food was eh and I mean eh as super bland I went with four people and I tasted all of their food as well. I found that it was not just my food. It was definitely not clean anywhere I looked and the area where they were cooking was a complete disaster.  I'm also sure that they were not properly staffed... The food took forever to get to me and I ordered something super simple. The staff was not very friendly but it could be due simply to them being stressed with being short staffed who knows. People were confused as where to be seated and you could tell that they were getting upset because no one was telling them where they could sit much lack of direction and order. Aside from all the tables smelling like they were wiped down with a musty used rag.  I won't be returning to this location hopefully there is better waffle houses in the area. But I'm sure other people probably had a better experience depending on the day or time who know."}
{"text":"east valley waffle house treats its employees like they are slave labor with low pay and demanding hours. they take pay from their employees paychecks and threaten them with low hours and no job if they resit. i recommend calling the labor board and ethics departmen if you work there especially on that pos owner andrew!"}
{"text":"Just ur standard ass Waffle House, convenient nothing great nothing wrong. Something to eat 24/7 , 7days a week"}
{"text":"You realize that the whole staff of the this place does nothing but sell and smoke weed in the back near the dumpsters, and they have friends in cars sitting out front it's like a social drug network there the moment they it dies down from the late night bar staff.  Food is still good just takes forever to get anything and THEY NEVER HAVE SUPPLIES OR ANSWER PHONE. Constantly out of cups and carry out containers."}
{"text":"I would say; waffles are the most overrated item at Waffle House, and probably the worst on the menu.   Bacon? Hash browns? Amazing.  Eggs? Toast? As can be expected.   Does Waffle House often have a sketchy vibe? I mean, sure. But it's always a great time.  Just don't come here expecting it to be a classy brunch venue; it isn't.  But I have been to Waffle Houses throughout the Southeast and Southwest USA, and it is consistently sketchy, cheap, delicious food, and I will always return."}
{"text":"We decided to give the. Waffle House a try!!! All the years we have driven by and never stopped in... this could be our lucky day! Our service was exceptional. We were seated right away and boy there was a lot of food!!! I will definitely be back and try other items on the menu. Thank you for a great first!!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly at this location and I appreciate that. The food is hot and fast. All that aside, I won't be going back Waffle House. They don't believe in butter, instead it's a butter spread. What's that about? Oh, now you wanna cut calories. The white bread toast was stale. But this is was took the cake....my bacon was burnt! I could have overlooked the \"butter\" and the stale bread until you burned my bacon. Oh no you didn't!"}
{"text":"Walking into this place, you already know what you're going to get.  Sticky tables, sticky floors, nasty bathrooms.  My friend ordered a waffle that came with strawberries, frozen strawberries-watery and tasteless. Unfortunately, this disappointment, big Eggo-type waffel stayed with her for the next 24 hours.  I ordered the patty melt that did not come with the requested grilled onions, was said to be on Texas toast.  The toast was more like the size of Rhode Island.  Will we go back?  Nope, this was a night not worth repeating.  Only reason for two stars is our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"One reason why I can't move back to Sacramento is Waffle House. When it's late and you don't want regular fast food, or if you just want some good waffles, cheese grits, and other diner food and you're on this side of the Valley, this is your spot. Great after a concert at the nearby Ak-Chin Pavilion gets out, and it'll let some time pass for the rest of the departing traffic."}
{"text":"Skip this location.  Restaurant was dirty, server was disheveled, standing water on the floor by the frig area, etc.  One of those times that I wished we had just gotten up and walked away...."}
{"text":"Terrible chili bad service not worth the walk from the hotel!!! The servers were real ghetto!!!!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, Waffle House. It used to be a guilty pleasure until Sean Brock affirmed my affection for the place (check out Anthony Bourdain and Sean Brock Eat at Waffle House on YouTube). We had the two egg breakfast, one scramble and one over medium. I'd suggest not getting scrambled, they just don't come out nicely on the flat top grill. The over medium came out perfectly. We also got smothered hash browns that were delicious, and a side of sausage gravy over biscuits which was lights out tasty. The grits are something not to miss; creamy, buttery, flavorful deliciousness. Excellent location right off of I-71."}
{"text":"Oh infamous Waffle House, ubiquitous breakfast place of the south for many a hungover/still drunk patron.  As far as Waffle Houses go this one was pretty clean and friendly. Food here tastes the same as any other Waffle House I would say mediocre. But you know what? It all tastes so good when you're hungover from a crazy night. Granted I felt a bit sick afterwards from eating so much fatty processed food but we all have to make sacrifices when we are trying to eat and have only found $7 around the house right?  Service is friendly, being really close to where I had passed out the night before, cleanliness, and massive amounts of cheap food make this Waffle House a winner in my book. Really what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I was at this Waffle House on the way to Williamsburg, and bumped into Chad E. on the way back from the outer banks in the wee hours of the morning. If you classify the wee hours of the morning as 10am anyways.  We ate our super cheap breakfast and man you sure get a lot of food for like $6 don't you? Then we left. I mean it's a waffle house, they're pretty much all the same except for the service right? I actually just felt bad because this has been bookmarked for so long and I've never actually taken the time to write something about it. The service here is very cheerful and will even take some time out of their busy cooking to chat it up a bit. How nice."}
{"text":"I go here a lot. They have this Hashbrowns Bowl that you can sub for Philly Cheesesteak for a dollar more and it's so good.  I just wish they could bring their prices down a bit. Also I find it very disconcerting that if you order Togo you are charged a 10% gratuity THAT THE SERVER DOESN'T GET.  Come on Waffle House you make me pay extra and you don't even give them the tip that's bad business but still back to the review.  The people here have figured me out I'll start playing the TouchTunes jukebox before I arrive and I heard them wondering who was playing music.  Now they ask me where the music is when I go in there.  Food always comes out quick at this Waffle House and is prepared correctly to order which is a !majority of the star rating here.  They do tend to keep clean so that's good too."}
{"text":"You know I've been to a whole slew of Waffle Houses but this one is special to me.  The ones here always take good care of me here.  Food is made well and quickly on every visit.  Since May of 2017 I've visited this location about 10 times and they've never failed to please.  I go more for the experience than the food and that's weird to say considering it's just Waffle House.  I will say they keep the temperature pretty comfortable compared to other WH which like to run the AC and it be 20 below zero outside.  They do like to keep it pretty clean which is always a plus for me.  The bathroom was nice and clean.    My waitress kept checking on me and kept my drink refilled.  She was working by herself too so that's definitely worth merit here alone.  I really go out of my way to come to this Waffle House because I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I'll receive great food fast along with quality customer service.  Check them out if you haven't been to this location.  It's on my top list!"}
{"text":"Picture it, Monday late morning.... hungover college kids in their jammies trying to soak up the residual alcohol with greasy hash browns...... perfect..... I didn't shower either.....  Waffle House.... always offers a stick to your bones kinda breakfast... Greasy spoon,truck stop meals offered at all hours of the day. The service was quick and prompt, the food hot.  Place reminds me of the old Waffle Houses I frequently went to back in the South East. Glad to see them here in Tempe. Ordered the steak and eggs... hash browns with chili topping.... pecan waffles... oh snap... dessert for breakfast.... anyways... good belly filling meal.....  The AC was nice and cold and ate a good meal. What else can you ask for? For breakfast anywayz."}
{"text":"Waffle House at this location is as good as it gets !  Great food.  Fun staff.  Weird clientele.  However, we are all there for one thing and that is to eat great food at a great price.    My favorite meal is the two pork chops and eggs which includes hasbrowns and  toast all for about $7.  Its a cool place to hang out as well.  Their dessert pies are super cheap too.    $1.50 are you kidding me ?"}
{"text":"Lady cooking the food can't get off her phone long enough to cook. The waitresses reek of cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"Waffle House oh Waffle House, you are the redheaded step child of Ihop; Denny's barefoot, pig chasin' cousin from Alabama; but by golly, if you aren't there every drunken 2 AM. with your arms wide open and a plate full of waffles on the table!   You're a steadfast friend, tired and true. You don't have a morning and night menu with increased prices, no! Your prices are the same no matter what time of day it is, and hell, you keep the menus on the table, and that's what I like. By the time the waitress comes around I've already decided what I want, how my eggs should be cooked and what I'm having to drink. You even have Senora Jackie's Casa de Waffle Picante Sauce, and that's what really matters."}
{"text":"I really just had to eat here. I've seen this place so many times from the drive from California to Texas. On my visit to Arizona I made it a must try before I headed home to CA. It's a diner of course with truck drivers that eat here. The waffles here are excellent! The only place that make it better would be Roscoe's in CA. They were made to perfection here. I coulda ate just that. I also got eggs, sausages, toast ,and hashbrowns with country gravy. Everything was typical sort of like Denny's. The waffles though were like WOW.   Recommendation: WAFFLES!"}
{"text":"Service and Quality has fallen off.  Beeen awhile since I have been and I hate to say, it's not as good as it was when I  was here last year in August.  Granted it was a lot busier at 10am than in was at 2 am but they seemed to be fully staffed.  Walked in and with some hesitation, they seated me a booth.  Granted I know that they prefer to seat singles on the counter seats and save the booths for couples and larger parties but I get a booth.  They did have the music turned up so loud that you could not hear yourself think but they did eventually turn it down.  Ordered the Steak and Eggs with hashbrowns.  Steak was to be medium rare, eggs over well and just straight hashbrowns with no toppings.  Steak was far beyond medium rare and rapidly approaching well done and had not been trimmed properly so that was a big slab of fat on the side.  Eggs were OK but the hashbrowns were so under cooked they were basically raw and I did not finish them.  Did get my coffee promptly but did not get a refill till I was getting ready to pay my check.  One additional point I find amusing is that the menu encourages you to share on Facebook, Twitter and all the other major Social Media sites but the don't have WiFi, free or otherwise. If they do, it's turned off."}
{"text":"So i am starting this review without the star rating. Once i have eaten i will add that. The server i have here has been nothing but rushing me to order... food showed up. Cooked amazingly and well seasoned.  This server is just hounding me about things. I would enjoy this meal if i could eat in peace."}
{"text":"Always nice and friendly service when we dine in or carry out. We never know what we want and our server always lets us know what's the best value for what we're craving."}
{"text":"This Waffle House is closed. It's been leveled due to the light rail construction. The building is no longer standing."}
{"text":"First of all the waffles are warm and soft and the bisquets are so good. You put honey or jam on the bisquets and ut melts in your house. They sure know how to make any egg dish you want. And the coffee is great. So stop by at a waffle house"}
{"text":"Since most all the Waffle Houses are in the south, was not sure what to expect from one in Phoenix.  Especially since the company refuses to build in Las Vegas telling us they need a distribution center in between Georgia and here.  So why is there one in Phoenix and looks like its the real thing??  White Castle figured it out!!    But i digress.  This is the real thing right down to the cute little old lady who was our waitress, complete with an apron filled with buttons and badges.  the Waffles were the same as I remembered from the south.  Tasty, a little chewy and round with their syrup... Absolutely heaven... The hash Browns are the selling point.  Smothered and covered!!  So easy, yet nobody else has figured out how to do that!    They move you in, get you seated and fed and move you out... Love it..."}
{"text":"We were greeted at the door by a young lady letting me know it would be a 20 min wait for a booth.  The place is a bit small and looks like it may fit about 100?  Once inside Angel greeted us with our menus.   Food came to us QUICK!!   We had:  Peanut butter waffle - it's peanut butter chips melted on waffles. yum!! Plain waffle - butter n maple syrup soooo good! Texas eggs and bacon sandwich was delicious Scrambled eggs - plain variety Eggs over medium - PERFECTLY MADE!!  Grits - kinda clumpy Hashbrowns - processed, but none the less fine Coffee - great cup of cafe Java  Angel is an awesome server, though the cashier mentioned she from another House... Just helping out here as most of their crew is in Vegas for a wedding.  They need to snatch Angel up! She was super busy but still kept up with checking in on us.   Everyone there is so friendly!  I literally walked out with a smile from the great experience.  Talk about starting the morning off right! :)"}
{"text":"Loud and noisy.  Don't go there if you want to have a quiet relaxing meal.  Food is just ok.  IHOP is even better."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, huge portions, very cheap. 4 meals with drinks 39 bucks. cant go wrong. too bad there's none in LA!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, like most Waffle houses.. but service is bad, never pick up phone for take out orders"}
{"text":"Took almoat 40 mins to get my to-go food There were people who ordered after me who got their order before me Then, the waitress who took my order, kept my change thinking I was tipping her for my to-go order.....Worst experience!!"}
{"text":"Dad- this is a relatively new waffle house. The staff are friendly & cheerful. The service and quality is not up to Waffle House standards. WH corporate should spend more time training at this location. Considering the attitude and demeanor of the staff this location has potential I will try it again in six months in hopes that training and proficiency has improved the service and quality.  Son- My waffle was good but there was an uncooked batter like substance hanging off the edge of my plate. It was disconcerting and freaky. And they forgot to bring the syrup but that's ok."}
{"text":"fire!!!   great customer service, food made to perfection! bummed I didn't get our servers name but she was just a doll!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I went to this location. I am very pleased that this location as with all other locations it is consistent in the flavors and everything else. This is the go to place in a pinch."}
{"text":"This is the best Waffle House I've ever been to, and I've been to a lot. Great food, super friendly staff, clean and efficient. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"They're casual as hell in here and just as friendly.    Isn't that what Waffle House is all about?"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place but my first impression was to run away. One of the reviews actually mentioned that the grungier the place, the better the food...  In any event, we were staying at a hotel around the corner and one of my children woke up sort of sick so I wanted to go some where super quick with the other two (non sick children have to eat y'know). It ended up not being super fast because they were slammed and there was a lot of confusion when we first got there about how to get a table. I almost left a few times...but I just had a feeling I should stay. We ended up at the bar with a view of the staff ordering process and cooks!! What fun! The wait staff has an order in which they can place the table orders to the line cooks and they yell it out! And you can watch them making the waffles, too. The coffee was yum. The staff was the greatest and to see them all giving eachother support and still smiling at the customers and eachother was just a great way to start the day!   If you like waffles and nice people, come here!   It was only like $24 for food for me and my three kids (we brought the sick one a waffle) and I recommend tipping well, they deserve it."}
{"text":"So if you're going to a Waffle House, you are expecting Waffle House food and they are amazing at consistency. Waffle perfection according to teenagers... and the over easy eggs are as oerfect as you remember 20 years ago. I rate it 4 stars because they deliver exactly what you're looking for from them. Do I prefer different fun awesome brunch and breakfasts?? Of course! But.. if you need Waffle House you know it's going to be exactly what you want."}
{"text":"It's always nice to have breakfast at 8PM! A nice fiesta omelette (ham, cheese, tomato, jalapeño pepper omelette), sunny side up eggs and bacon always be my number one breakfast item. Top it off with white bread with butter. They offer order as you like for $6.47 which I think it was a really good deal if you are really hungry. Overall, going to this restaurant is really worth my breakfast craving on dinner time!"}
{"text":"They only get 2 stars because the price.  I know the Waffle House isn't known for their service but, today's was horrible. The cooks had yelled for our order to be picked up 4 times and she kept walking by it and even took another order after ours was finished...before bringing ours. Jodi was our \"server\".  Late night is way better"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday around 11:30am. Was greeted upon arrival and told to sit anywhere I'd like. There was only one other customer there so the waitress was very attentive. They were in the middle of switching shifts so my check came at the same time as my food but I was told there was no rush on it. It was pretty noisy because they were cleaning, moping, taking out trash etc. preparing for the shift change. My food was served quick and hot. I'm not really a fan of their waffles which is crazy because it's called the \"Waffle House\". Anyways, for a basic meal it was ok. $9.50  scrambled eggs, raisin toast, a waffle and grits. A little high for breakfast prices. If you're looking for fast, basic food in a place where you can sit down with decent staff and attentiveness this is the place you should come."}
{"text":"So Christmas eve we ventured out to IHOP for dinner only to discover that it was closed. We headed for waffle house instead. My wife wanted breakfast and I just wanted food.  We sat at a booth and had a look at the menu. There was a wide choice of food available. I ordered a waffle, Bert's best chili and all the way homefries. Our waitress Jane was prompt with our drinks.  She did tell me that they had to throw away the chili so I ordered a ham & cheese omelet instead. I thought the food was great with the exception of the omelet. They folded the eggs over a hunk of cold cheese.  The homefries were delicious. The waffle was cold but filling. My wife didn't like her view of the kitchen and commented that my meal looked like vomit. She kept staring at me in horrified fascination as I cleared my plate.  Never again she said! I'll go back one day. As other yelpers have commented it's a very friendly restaurant with good food."}
{"text":"It's a Waffle House, what are you expecting. Yeah, it's bit sketchy-looking. The food is always great and served within 15 minutes of ordering. Oh and need I remind you of the cheap prices. My husband will walk out of there spending less than 20 bucks and when we hit up WH we eat like it's our last meal.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of the Waffle House. I usually get the Double Waffle for $3.95 and leave with a full belly. Sometimes I can't get any work done in the morning since I'm so full. So I need to remind myself that one waffle will usually do it. BTW - I think the hash browns are weak with too much grease and need to be cooked a little more.  I brought the owner of our company to this place and now the only place he wants to go to is the Waffle House. I really blew it, since I'm no longer dining at the more fancier restaurants in the area since the Waffle House seems to be the only restaurant in his rotation.  This place also has all you can eat starting at 2pm thru 9pm for like $6.99. I'm not sure if that's breakfast or everything on the menu. This place serves burgers, pork chops and pie as well. I haven't had a burger or pie but I would definitely give the pork chop a \"B\", as in BRUTAL. Do yourself a favor and don't order a pork chop. I would stick to only the breakfast items at the Waffle House, especially the waffles."}
{"text":"There's not a Waffle House in our area. So I've been eyeing this one for a long time waiting for the right opportunity to check it out since I've always enjoyed the Waffle House in my travels to Atlanta. It so happens that they were paving our street and my wife and I had to get out of the house early a couple of weeks ago.  You seat yourself at the Waffle House and then the waitress comes over and takes your drink order. I also ordered the two waffle plate with water which came to $4.20 after tax. The waffles were excellent after coating them with soft butter and syrup. If I can editorilize a little bit here, this is soft butter, not the hard butter pellets that have been sitting in the freezer. It makes a big difference for me in enjoying the meal. You should never have to melt your own butter.  In conclusion, the food is affordable, tastes great and the service and A/C work just fine."}
{"text":"The Waffle House.  A national breakfast tradition.  People get married at Waffle Houses.  People plan family reunions at Waffle Houses.  I really, and I do mean REALLY do not want to meet these people.  The yellow plastic sign is a harbinger:  this will not be fine dining.  I know, I know.  People love the place because it is cheap.  Very cheap.  If you only had the coins you found lodged between the seat and the center console, they would still roll out a full breakfast for you.  WITH the standard three percent tip.  So, here's the tradeoff:    The Good?  Price!  It is cheap.  Inexpensive.  Downright stingy.  If you can't afford Waffle House, chances are you'll never, ever see this review, because you'll be too busy re-writing your cardboard sign or standing by the exit ramp.  Have I mentioned it doesn't cost much to eat here?  The Bad?  Everything else.  They save money in so many ways.  Cleanliness.  Food quality.  Lighting.  Menus.  Employees.  This is the bottom of the food chain.  This is where, if you're either still drunk or supremely hungover, you slide into a booth, pull down your ironic hoodie, and mumble, \"Coffee.  And whatever else I can get for... let's see... four dollars and thirteen cents.  And Coffee.\"  \"We're not in the food business.  We're in the people business.\"  So goes their slogan.  I kinda like my restaurants to BE in the food business.  My final ruling:  Betwixt one and no stars.  Keep driving.  (And Mark G?  That last comment of yours is un-called for.)"}
{"text":"Ok lets just talk about the food on this one. I love waffle house food. I always get the same thing when I go there. The pecan waffle, country ham, smoother, cover hashbrowns, and vanilla coke. I'm usually never disappointed. With Waffle House is always depends on location. Depending on which location you go to your experience will varies. One location you might be in the middle of soap opera, at another you are seeing what you missed at the club last night. So my overall point is you will never be board if you go to a waffle house."}
{"text":"Arrived early on a Sunday morning during a shift change.  Thought we'd have to wait as a result.  We were seated immediately and ordered shortly thereafter.  Food came fast and was delicious.  They never missed a beat during the shift change.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Is the waffle chocolate chip suppose to suppose to have the chocolate chips melting inside and through the batter itself or throw the toppings on top as serve? Or is it laziness?"}
{"text":"Ok just went here with my kids they were off from school , so i decided to go here for breakfast . We got there it's somewhat busy but not extremely place is small so looks crowded. Waiting for a table see 2 tables that have empty plates , made eye contact with servers no one notice us for 5 min until the guy cooking say something one of the waitress went and pick table , she didn't look like in a good mood already, we sat and  and order drinks she came like  4  min later and took order here where the fun begins. Finish coffee wanted more see her going to refill other customers bypass me until I asked for more she refill it. My kid wanted waffle with chocolate chips , she said didn't have any( when paying saw customer with chocolate chips waffles on her to go order ) we got our breakfast with my other kid no bacon so i waited  nothing happened so I ask for bacon she replied it was on my way but she has to clean table . Ok bacon arrived min later, cold so was my breakfast that I ate half waiting on bacon. Ok almost there, guess what ? She forget my kids bacon so I call her ( my kid saying forget dad) and ask her not to charge me her bacon, her replied was I don't have u ticket yet, ok fine hopefully she didn't charge me.

Ok hang in there go pay at register customer ahead of me she pays, so I'm next girl walk away and leaves me there cash and ticket on hand, min go by so I ask her can u  charge me, she said, you have to wait , can u believe that? Ok maybe this was my first and last  time at this Waffle House ."}
{"text":"Superbowl Sunday and coming back from playing tennis, looked at Ihop and lines out the door so came by here. Also a line but not so crazy even though it's small inside we went in and ordered to go and it was quite efficient and when we got back to our hotel to eat where quite pleased and good value."}
{"text":"Great Waffles delicious hot coffee and cooked to order breakfast.  They also have a juke box."}
{"text":"This was a joke for a diner. Server i had was extremely unprofessional. 3 types of waffles on the menu. No french toast. McDonalds breakfast blows this place out of the water and way cheaper."}
{"text":"Was a usual great experience. Thank you Waffle House because no matter which one I go to I am assured a great experience.   The Waffle House at:  8635 Hankins Rd Charlotte NC 28269,   I was really impressed with a waitress \"Whitny\" who was calm, courteous, and attentive in a very busy morning on her job! She proudly represents what Waffle House intends on their customers to experience! Thank you Whitny for making my morning much better!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Waffle house! We don't have them back home in CA, so it's nice to get to come here and get really good breakfast for cheap! This is along the lines of good and gets a lot of locals like Roscoe's chicken and waffles in socal.   I usually get the same thing: hashbrowns smothered (onions) and capped (mushrooms), with a side of bacon and sausage and if I'm really hungry that day, either the chocolate or strawberry waffles. I haven't been disappointed yet! My friend likes the chocolate waffles and my bf is more adventurous, he gets the specials, omelets, sandwiches, biscuits and gravy and he usually leaves stuffed and very happy. I don't think we've ever spent more than $17 for two people and that's a good amount of food!  The service is pretty good, even at busy times. And I'm tempted to try the all you can eat buffet for $5.99 but I don't wanna clog my arteries!"}
{"text":"I think I like this waffle house location less than the one on N 59th and the 1-10, though this one is slightly less ghetto. This location is usually pretty busy, but good thing is that the service is pretty fast and the food quality is still good. I would advise not sitting by the bar where the sink is. If someone is having a bad day, they might splash a lot of soapy water near your food!   The servers are nice and they make the food relatively quickly considering how many people come in and out in an hour's time. It's cheap, good eats and fun to go to once in awhile for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, we love Waffle House.  This location is typical for a WH, old and dirty, but that somehow doesn't detract from it.  There was a wait to be seated, also normal in our experience at several WHs.    We stopped in for breakfast, and had Mama Jude as our server.  She was awesome, and funny as well.  She took our orders quickly, kept our drinks full, and brought the food out hot and fresh.  We both got our usual All Star Platter, and added cheese to the grits.  I love the customizability of the menu items (cheese, chocolate chips, etc).  It was greasy and delicious as always, and as is expected at a diner style restaurant like that!  And seriously, you can't beat the people watching."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked into Waffle House. There was no one in Waffle House at around 1:35. It was silent. Workers doing nothing. We sat down and we were having a conversation and my boyfriend said a swear word, next thing we know before we got any type of service we were being asked to leave. I get it he should not of swore but when no one is in a business and you kick them out that is beyond ridiculous. Worst part is unlike all these other people I always take care of my server. You def lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in Phoenix visiting family we stop at the Waffle House at least once. We enjoy the waffles, eggs, and bacon. A delicious way to start a day of shopping and hanging out.  Laurel, our waitress, was both friendly and attentive.   The waffles were just as expected . . . warm, tasty, flavorful and abundant. The hint of vanilla brings it home for me everytime. In fact, I use no topping so as not to dilute the robust waffle flavor.   Scrambled eggs. Perfection. Two eggs scrambled on the grill. Not overdone. Fluffy, and delicate.  Glass of orange juice. Heaven."}
{"text":"I stopped at this waffle house it was really good, affordable prices and the waffle was soooo good. I was surprised even the people were ok dint expect this since I was in Arizona, maybe everyone is just happy since the food is so good. Its a small place seems everyone is eating next to each other but you forget it once you get your order. Wish we had them in the LA area as we lack breakfast places that are actualy good."}
{"text":"Definitely a truck stop place but they make great hash browns and my breakfast was good. Attentive servers....little too noisy for me but in all, a decent breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Went here with the kids on a busy Saturday morning, they provided excellent service and food.  Our waitress was top notch and the food was excellent! We couldn't have asked for a better experience!"}
{"text":"Clean, prompt service. The food was ready quickly. Taste very good. One of the better ones I've been at."}
{"text":"Great place to stop. The service was good and so was the food. Simple menu with all the basics.  This joint is pretty small though but still a good stop for early or late breakfast."}
{"text":"Seriously..I love Waffle House.  On all, i mean, ALL of my trips to GA to visit fambly, I make at least a trip or two to Waffle House.  So imagine my surprise when on a trip to Dodgers' Spring Training in Glendale, AZ, my hubby brings me to Waffle House. I could NOT believe they've made it this far west! SO very pleasing.  So, I ordered my greedy-gut/fave dish....the All-Star Special...PECAN waffle, 3 strips of bacon, grits, cheese scrambled eggs and white toast...plus a SWEET TEA. (singing)  HEEEEAAAVENNNN....I'M IN HEAAAAVEEN My hubby also got the All-Star Special. How can you not when you want to sample ALL the wares?!  He got regular waffle, bacon AND sausage for a dolla more, hash browns smothered and covered and double diced (that's cheese, onions and double tomatoes for all youse NOT in the know), white toast, cheese scrambled eggs and a coke. YUM!  If you're not a grits fan, definitely get the Hashed Browns...customized exactly how you like it. (Mine were   Everything was great. I mean, as far as great gets at Waffle House. Don't fricking go here thinking you're gonna have a fancy-schmancy meal. But it'll be GOOD!"}

However my Brother would disagree and I have plenty of friends that call it Awful House.....  one down side on this location....come on guys mop the damn floor...kind of gross...  Was a cutie seating near me at the counter....  I got my Waffle House fix....cheese egg special for me  Cheap as Hell...wish we had them in Cali"}

When I see your awkward plain square yellow letters...W...A...F....F....L...E.....H....O....U....S...E....I truly light up inside.....you have been my inspiration to continue driving on many of my road trips.....I just keep going and going and going...from one waffle house to the next through out the whole country......sometimes I am unfaithful to you and swing in to Cracker Barrel...but you always get me first..they get your sloppy seconds......Yes I can see your sign in my mind right now.....  I swing in and almost sprint inside....I force myself in between to fat smelly truck drivers at the counter...and then I wait for the oh so ugly staff with the lazy eye and missing teeth to ask my for my order.( I wonder if having a lazy eye is a job requirement at Waffle House ).....no need for a menu...I know....I always know.....I want the cheese egg special that comes with raison toast ,apple butter and yummy ass hashbrowns ( be careful in some states it comes with nasty ass grits ).......sometimes I get a double order of eggs......and a diet coke ofcourse.....  Then I watch as the even uglier sweaty cooks go to work on my breakfast...my mouth waters...not even the stench of the fat truck driver staring a my tits next to me....can stop my excitement...my tongue waits to lick the plate...greesy cheesy goodness....no need to have any class here....as I look around at another truck driver picking his nose in the corner.....  I dream of Waffle House.....and my 3 dollar breakfast...its the first place I stop as soon as I leave California.....God how I wish we had one in my State"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Waffle House for many, many years.  They have the best waffles , chicken breast and hash brown in the buinsess       Waffle houses at times get a bad rep, open 24 hours , so called truck driver stop. Truth be told they usual live up to that hype.   I just so happen to bump into a very nicer waitress names Andrea , very out going and attentive to my family's needs."}
{"text":"Nina and the chef were awesome! They were so much fun and have a great sense of humor! The customer service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Very rude and disrespectful.. Called in to place a to go order and was hung up on the first time. Called back and asked to hold only to hear chatter in the background for several minutes.. This is not the type of establishment I have grown to love from Waffle House.."}
{"text":"The food was ok, service decent, staff was friendly. However for a place that calls themselves \"waffle house\", the waffle was as thin as a pancake and very small. I was bummed out looking at the waffle.      On the flipside, hashbrowns are good. They allow you to load it with different tons."}
{"text":"Love the food here The waffles of course are a must. I like a side of bacon to go with it. Smothered hash browns are good too.  I prefer them well done.  Ice tea, I ordered 50/50 sweet and non sweet.  Our server remembered us from last year.  Pretty amazing the details she rendered about us."}
{"text":"Great little eatery off the freeway. Great deals on everything comfort food. Staff was friendly and nice. A few booths, lots of counter space.  Food was definitely comfortable. Reasonably clean. 7 bucks gets you 2 eggs cooked your way, meat, toast, hashbowns or grits, waffles. Parking is a snap. Close to everything.  Check comes old school, written on yellow carbon copy. Decor is old school googie style. I love this little place. I'll be back again and again....."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Waffle House many, many times. My breakfast this morning was absolutely perfect. Just what I was hoping for. Their hashbrowns are delicious, and they have THE best bacon ever. Always crispy, never burnt or undercooked. My eggs were cooked perfectly too. They were very busy this morning, but we didn't wait more than 5 minutes for our food. Two thumbs up, and a very satisfied belly."}
{"text":"DELISHHHHHHH. Need I say more ? Enjoyed some food with the gang here. Day 2 in Charolette. The chocolate chip waffle was amazing. Just enough chips inside. I also enjoyed eggs & cheese, hash brown and sweet tea!! Yup.... I'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a softy for breakfast foods. I fell in love with Waffle House in Orlando, Florida and when I was in Arizon; I knew I must have some breakfast. I love their menu prices and fast service, sometimes it can be a bit of a wait yet be patient as it is worth it."}
{"text":"Took my brother to Waffle House on our trip back from Texas to California. He's never been to a waffle house before and he was a little nervous about going in. Once we were seated and he looked at the menu he was amazed.  Our server Kevon and his sidekick Karee we're the best funniest servers I've ever had the pleasure of waiting on me.   Karee Carrie wanted my brother to put on one of the Waffle House hats. When he went into the bathroom I placed a bet with her that she couldn't get him to put it on. I let her know I would buy her breakfast if she could get him to do it. Without telling him that she and I had placed a bet with each other.  That kind of tweaked her a little bit she had to think. At the end of this amazingly good breakfast. I asked to take a picture of my two servers. That was Karee's to get my brother to put the hat on and take a picture. This girl thinks very very smart she won the bet. I paid her we left I laughed.  Thank you so much for making a fantastic breakfast experience for us."}
{"text":"Waffle House has never let me down and this location didn't either. It was roomier than others I have been to, so that was a plus. Our server was very attentive and so were the other servers there. I really felt the servers provided exceptional customer service, constantly coming by to ask if we needed anything else. The food was delicious as usual. First time we had ordered sausage there, they use the sausage patties. The waffles were phenomenal! They are a must to order, even if you've never been much of a waffle person before. They can't go wrong with baking in the \"toppings\". Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Never been to a Waffle House until today and I am impressed. The two women who worked here are friendly and courteous! I was about to order to go but there was no need as my All Star meal was cooked in less than 5 minutes and delicious. Hash Browns are unique here as they are mixed with other things like mushrooms, onions, ham and cheese. I did that and put my eggs on top (Very delicious). Also it us the WAFFLE HOUSE you should get WAFFLES there too. All of this and a soda for less than $16 with tip. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Also great menu to choose from and open 24 hours.  Can't go wrong with that.  Perfect for after the bars or just want a late night snack but you don't wanna cook.  Yes ma'am!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing and friendly-the service was fast and we were in and out in no time :)"}
{"text":"Last Christmas Eve my wife and I were staying in a nearby hotel. We had our dog with us so we needed to find a takeout place that was open during the holidays and Waffle House fit the bill. The service was so prompt and friendly and the food went so well with our hotel room screening of Die Hard 2 (a solid sequel, though a little limiting to Bonnie Bedelia's character), that we just had to do it again the next year.   Once again I was met with excellent service. While waiting for my order, every single member of the staff (not just wait staff, cooks too) checked to make sure I had been helped. I imagine there were a lot places they would rather have been late at night on Dec. 24, but everyone working was laughing, joking, and making merry. I ordered a breakfast wrap with eggs, cheese, and hashbrowns. It was hefty, tasty and kept me nice and warm while my wife and dog and I checked out Die Hard With a Vengeance (not overtly Christmassy though still fun - but where is Bonnie Bedelia?!)  The day after Christmas this year we went back to Waffle House to meet some relatives for breakfast. The place was packed but they handled it quite well. One staffer was stationed at the door to direct customer traffic and wish everyone well. Our family was opening a lot of Christmas presents, and our server offered to collect the used wrapping paper to save space. Awesome!  A sign in the restaurant said this franchise was called JD's Wild West Waffles. If Phoenix is where you keep your homestead, or if you're rambling through like me, stop in and enjoy a hot meal and the feeling of being welcome."}
{"text":"Awesome meal! Great service our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive to what we needed. The food came out quick and it was very good. Visited this location in the afternoon so there were minimal guests. Making it very easy to have a normal conversation. No shouting necessary. Definitely will be back !"}
{"text":"My First and Last Visit   So I always hear people say how they  love the Waffle House and in all my years I had never been to one, but I wanted to try it. Unfortunately that was a  mistake.  I have to be honest I  wasn't impressed when we walked in, however, I tried to keep an open mind, after all I couldn't expect fine dining.  It didn't take long before I knew I'd never visit another Waffle House again.   The first hint was the horrible smell that could only be compared to a port a jon. Next was the  dirty greasy menu and spotty silverware the waitress delivered to the table.  Then our food came and everything appeared to have been cooked in old grease, the food tasted absolutely horrible. The waitress noticed we weren't eating much and asked  if everything was ok. We paid the bill and quickly left to free up the table.  I know many people like the Waffle House and that's great , but the Waffle House just wasn't for me. At least I satisfied my curiosity."}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Used to eat here regularly but service has gone down past few visits.  Asked for water 3 times and didn't get it. Coffee cup was filthy with some unidentified piece of something floating in it.  This is a greasy place but is to be expected.  Usually get good service here but last 3 visits have been substandard.  Won't be going back...too many other options.  Note:  The waitress that I asked 3 times for water preferred to go over to her friends and chat.  I walked out."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast this morning. There was a short wait but nothing too crazy. There was a family in front of us who was waiting to be seated. The waitress seated them and after a couple of minutes they were back in the waiting area waiting to be re-seated. They seated them at a different table and everything seemed ok. We thought it was a little strange but didn't think too much of it. The waitress came over and seated us in the same section the family had been sitting in. My boyfriend picked up his menu and ants started crawling out from under it. He started to look around and there were a couple crawling on his pants. We immediately got up and walked out. We were disgusted and couldn't shake the feeling of things crawling on us. We've been to this particular waffle house a few times and this is our first time experiencing something like this. Doubt if we'll go back after this."}
{"text":"We decided to eat at the Waffle House because the diner we really wanted to go to had too long of a wait time. We walked in and we were surprised that they had seating available right away. We sat down and immediately felt uncomfortable because the a/c was on full blast. The  waitress came over right away and we ordered coffee. As we waited for the coffee, we got colder by the minute. She brought the coffee over and the minute she sat it down I realized that it wouldn't be long before my HOT coffee would turn into ICED coffee. The blast from the a/c was literally blowing all the steam right out of the coffee cup. We were wearing thick sweaters but we were still freezing. I started to realize that our food would get the same cooling effect as the coffee so we decided to leave.  Who wants to start out eating a hot meal to only have it turn ice cold before you have a chance to finish? We told the waitress that we didn't want to order anything else and wanted the bill. We told her that we were too cold to stay. She waived the bill and apologized and we left. The waitress was warm and friendly but the Waffle House was icy cold."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Entire family (8 of us) went in and where totally ignored.  We ended up leaving after 20 minutes with no acknowledgement."}
{"text":"After a morning of running errands, my hubby and I needed food. We decided Waffle House was a good, nearby option. We hadn't been to one in many, many years.   Let me tell you we were disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the prices were decent and the establishment fairly clean. We were seated right away and took a few minutes to look over the menu. I thought the menu was very confusing. Why? It was like a kindergarten picture book. (See my photo.) Give me a straight forward list with prices not all this back and forth, look here and there, here are the up sells, type menu. What the heck? I can read, I don't need a picture of a scrambled egg. I know what they look like.  Service was quick and our order came out very quickly. I had a waffle and a side of bacon. My husband had eggs, hash browns, grits, biscuits with gravy,  and a waffle.   I could not believe the look of my waffle. It was such a sad little waffle. I don't know what I was expecting, but has my husband said, \"It's the WAFFLE House\" meaning we were expecting amazing looking waffles. Ours were overcooked and so, so THIN. I think all I wanted was a pretty waffle for breakfast. Poor me! My bacon was so tiny and overcooked as well. I was good though, cuz bacon is bacon!  The syrup was so so sugary and the \"spread\" (aka butter substitute) was disgusting. It's nothing but hydrogenated oils. I didn't use it.  My husband said his biscuits and gravy tasted like English muffins with gravy on top. They did not look very appetizing at all.   It wasn't my favorite meal ever and we likely not be back. Just not our kind of place."}
{"text":"I like this location. Very safe Waffle House and it's clean and the staff here is friendly.  Always a good meal here. Our kids love it too!"}
{"text":"Went into this establishment while visiting Charlotte for the first time, and was not impressed. Upon entering there were only 2 tables being occupied but all of the other ones still had not been wiped down and were filthy. Also there were 3 prisoners or community service people in yellow vests washing the windows, splashing water all over the tables. So we had to sit at the bar. The bar was situated right next to the sink where one of the workers was vigorously washing dishes and splashing water all over the area where we were eating. This splashing did not stop when we got our coffees to drink.  The waitress was friendly but upon receiving our silverware I was horrified to see that my fork had a big glob of mustard on it. How could you b e working so hard to wash the dishes and not even notice the silverware isn't even clean?! Also my girlfriends butterknife looked to have water on it still but not clean water, dirty white soap water.  The only redeeming quality of this place was that our order was taken accurately and I didn't get food poisoning from my meal.  Would not go to again, if I'm visiting Charlotte again I will wait until I get back to Georgia to eat, this is the only nasty Waffle House I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I had to give them 1 star just to write a review. They deserve nano! Well I take that back. My waitress deserves no stars and made my visit very unpleasant. 1st I had to have her wipe the counter and she only did one pass missing lots of spots. Then I had to ask for the rest of my order. Next, she gave me a water and the cup smelled like dishwater! But here's the kicker she laid a napkin out with my utensils and it was dirty.  I really love the waffle house cause I love waffles. But, I won't come to this location again. I should just buy a waffle maker and make my own. One day. One day."}
{"text":"Im a little partial to this Waffle House it is closed for remodeling right now,it will reopen around Nov 6 2013 it will be even better that before.Stop by and check it out best breakfest Ive ever had.Good food fast and reasonable"}
{"text":"It's Waffle House  10:30 on a week night. Service was ok. Food was ok. Order wasn't 100% correct, bacon/waffles arrived long after eggs/toast/hash browns. Some Waffle Houses are better than others.  There are better Waffle Houses IMO. It's also a tough gig, so I don't have high expectations and you shouldn't either at this one."}
{"text":"Oh waffle house. How great you are at 2, 3, 4 AM. Some people love you. And some people hate you. I however, am a lover. I recently came to this Waffle House on a random whim. One night of gaming with friends and then \"hey, lets go to Waffle House!\" Is exactly how that went down. I believe it was 3 AM, and how delicious that all star breakfast was.   Mind you, I wasn't drunk at even the slightest. So that definitely makes me a credible review. This Waffle House is on of the close ones near my parent's house so I come here often. That and it it's a mid point between my friend's house. It's clean, and it's not like most other waffle houses.  So I get this, every time I come here. The all star breakfast: Over easy, hash browns, sausages, and waffles. Oh yes, delicious whenever at any time. If i'm up late again and decide to have food, this is where I'll be coming to for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. i got the special that came with 2 eggs (i got them over medium) hash browns (capped & smothered meaning mushrooms and sausage gravy as a topping on the hash browns which was amazing) 2 slices of ham, 2 pieces of bacon, two slices of toast and a waffle of your choice.  First of all this place is not called \"Waffle House\" for no reason, Absolutely the best Waffles here than i ever had anywhere else... and ive had waffles all over the damn place. Outstanding staff they were very nice and on top of things, if i ever come back to AZ i would come here first before stopping by at any other place."}
{"text":"I can Waffle on about Waffle House for hours and hours, but I won't. I'll just tell you - it's good.  I've eaten at several different Waffle Houses in Charlotte because well what can I say. I like the hashbrowns all the way - with Chili all over them - even though they make me run to the bathroom - and sometimes at 3 a.m. after a good concert there is nothing else worth eating. The problem is, as I say, they usually makes me run to the straight to the bathroom.  Then I have to Washle House my hands."}
{"text":"If you try to enter another dimension by eating here, you should go to Wormhole House instead.  I've eaten at this Waffle House in Fort Mill twice now. It's in the Chicago suburbs I mean the Charlotte suburbs not far from my friend's house. (Sorry, almost everything is in the Chicago suburbs so my predictive text likes to imagine that this is too, but I don't think they have Waffle Houses there).  I like to get the hash browns smothered and everything all the way (with Chili all over it to make it wet af), and she gets the all American breakfast. The food is actually pretty good. Prices are okay. The fact that is 24 hours is awesome. I run to the bathroom soon after having those Hash Browns, but what are you going to do? No literally, what?"}
{"text":"You know you are in a part of the country where the cost of living is lower than in San Francisco when the bill for 3 people is less than $15.    The restaurant is almost brand new.  There is a steady influx of locals and the staff is very friendly in that Southern sort of way.  The food when presented looks just like the pictures on the menu.  Imagine that, receiving exactly what is promised in advertising.  Unbelievable.  It is probably a good thing that we don't have this restaurant chain in the Bay Area because the fare definitely hits the spot after a night of imbibing.    If you visit this part of the country, make a Waffle House part of your tour.  You are guaranteed to leave feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Went here this morning around 10 am. There was like a 20 minute wait, but no biggie. Service was fast, orders were fresh and correct, and place was clean. It is the Waffle House, not a fancy joint. So for what it is, it was good. Plus the staff are all very easy going and create a fun lively atmosphere. Good for a casual breakfast."}
{"text":"I love Waffle House even when I'm not drunk and it's been many years since I was in college. Is it fancy? Hardly. Is the food good? Always. My standard fare is a regular waffle and hashbrowns that are smothered, covered, peppered with an over easy egg on top.  This location was super fast, the food was cooked well, and the waitstaff was on top of things. I just realized I left without looking for and taking over a TouchTunes, which is also a tradition I try to do when I go."}
{"text":"first thing I noticed was two employees eating a waffle off the same plate. They weren't on break just eating while working. The kitchen floor was filthy with food all over the floor near the grill. The employees just walked through it. Must of been 8 to 10 employees working but no one can sweep up the floor? The waffle makers and area they sit in were covered in globs of waffle batter...not sure if that's normal but it looked pretty gross. I'd pretty much lost my appetite while I stared at the kitchen from my seat..food was average but I didn't eat much..that was my first and last visit to waffle house. .not for me"}
{"text":"Pecan waffle was terrific. City ham was delicious. Coffee was so-so. Biscuit was amazing. Tip: order your bacon crisp and your hash browns crisp if you want them cooked right. One of our party of four got cheese melted on top of her hash browns and was really pleased. So all in all, a pretty good breakfast before the start of the drive back to CA."}
{"text":"worst service ever waited 15 mins did not get drinks.. every table was dirty.. saw them on their phones and smoking.. grosss!!!! worst server ever goes to Bre"}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!!!! Staff are very rude and loved talking amongst themselves rather than to paying customers. We arrived and waited for a table to be cleaned. Everyone noticed us just standing there but no one was in a rush to clean the tables off so that we could sit. Finally, when the lady went to clean the table she did so about 1/3 of the way and STOPPED to answer the work phone so that she could take an order over the phone, which left us standing! None of the other coworkers seemed bothered by it either bc no one stepped in to clean the table. After the phone order was taken another customer who was leaving wanted to pay his tab so, this same worker then proceeded to cash him out first before cleaning the table for us to sit down. Lastly, after we stood for a good 7-10mins (waiting for a table) before the worker cleaned it. When it was time to take our order she did so in a whispering manner! But was heard speaking way louder to her coworkers. I had to ask her several times what she was saying. The workers were extremely loud and playful and talked a lot about their personal lives. It was SO many workers there but no true team work at all!!!! One worker kept staring at me while he was on the bacon line! Very Weird!! Food was okay. My bf asked for grits but got hash browns. No one wore hair nets! JUST HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Should have trusted the reviews. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, SERVICE!!!!! Go some place else!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. But we had to listen to the manager bawling out a new employee while waiting for our food. Also noticed on the walls that all of their certificates were outdated"}
{"text":"Horrible we ended up just walking out they never even took our drink order after being there for just 15 minutes this was my first time there and I was looking forward to trying it but this just killed it for me"}
{"text":"We made a quick stop at this place and even though we ended up having to leave without eating, I wanted to mention the service was great. We were promptly greeted and seated, and our server was great. I believe his name is Brad."}
{"text":"Been here once with some friends late at night.  Good was alright, service was alright.  Our server had his girl hanging out who kept staring at us like we're about to \"steal\" her man....we were on a double date.  Worst part, the cook was brushing his hair with a fork...it was disgusting.  I stopped eating instantly. Will not return for any reason at all."}
{"text":"Decided to give this location a shot. Been here once before but, it's been awhile. Our server was Kadijah (most likely misspelled it) ; She was definitely friendly and well around a good server. The food was okay.. I ordered biscuits&gravy, so did my folks. Do not try the biscuits&gravy. The biscuit was flat, not fluffy plus the gravy was thick. Unfortunately, both biscuits&gravy was cold by the time they got to our table. Mentioned it to our waitress thinking she would take it off the tab but no. Just paid the whole meal but the staff are well around pleasant/upbeat."}
{"text":"Okay, let me explain the 5 star review.  This is not because it is a big fancy restaurant with gormet food, quite the opposite.  This is a good old fashioned diner that does what it does very well and consistently.  The whole staff is great and I love watching the 'Show' in the kitchen area.  The food is all very good and plentiful and I usually eat too much.  The prices are good too.  This place just brings back memories, pretty much exactly the same as the one in Orlando that my dad used to take me to 40 years ago."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for a quick, hardy meal. It's not the Ritz, but they do a fabulous job with the basics. Everything tasted fresh, and of course is made to order. My meal was cooked precisely as I ordered it, as was my sons chocolate chip waffles and bacon to go.  It was interesting to sit at the counter and watch the entire staff interact with each other. It is obvious that they all like each other and get along. The entire tone of the restaurant reflected that.  Mastercook Twan did a great job with my food, and Tina the waitress had a wonderful and genuine personality. Both offered up genuine conversation and sincere smiles."}
{"text":"If restaurants were fairy tales, Waffle House is \"Prince and the Pauper\". Its an exercise in humility. It allows you to see how the rest of the world eats while you're eating 25 dollar salads.  \"Oh what a wonderfully horrid place! Now, if we could only find the hostess...\"  Can't afford a hostess. Sorry. Just find a table. Try to find one that's clean.   \"Very well. Oh, I do think I would enjoy some sparkling water and cranberry juice-\"  There's soda and there's coffee. Or they have two flavors of water; dirty tap and dirty tap with ice.   \"Oh, um, very well. There doesn't seem to be enough menus for everyone at our party.\"  Share.  \"Oh...um, fair enough then. I will have the all-star special, with cheese on my eggs and, how do you say it, my hash browns 'smothered' and 'covered'? Oh that sounds so delightfully filthy.\"  Whatever turns you on, man.  \"Oh dear me, they're cooking it right in front of us...that man's not wearing any plastic gloves! He's man-handling my food with his bare hands! This is outrageo--oh wait...is this how you lowly folk eat? Well then, don't mind me! GET YOUR HANDS ALL OVER MY FOOD, GOOD MAN! IN FACT, I WOULD LIKE SOME EXTRA HAIR IN MY BACON! HAHAHA!\"  ...  \"No, seriously, I didn't want any hair in my bacon\"  Okay, well let me just pluck it out off your plate. All better then.  \"Did you just put YOUR hands on my food too!? The gall! The bravado! I love it!\"  How's your food?  \"My bacon's crunchy, I can feel the cheese you've smothered all over my eggs clogging my arteries, these hash browns are a texture and consistency I've never seen occur in nature anywhere, and another cup of this coffee and I'll be able to do wind sprints back to my house. I absolutely love it! I'm never going back to my old life of roasted pheasant and caviar ever again. Do you hear me world, EVAR!\"  It's something like that. For serious."}
{"text":"The people that work here are far from friendly or helpful.  You need to argue with them to have them take your order.  One guy said he couldn't take our order because our table wasn't in his jurisdiction.  Finally our waitress showed after quite some time.  Our waitress claimed it was because they had been busy since 9:30PM (we got there around 3am).  I do sympathize with the staff because the place was pretty busy, but they have to be a little friendlier.  The food was ok, but not great.  they also were out of the beef for the dinner i ordered."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this Waffle House, I wasn't sure if I should risk my only chance at eating at a Waffle House at this location. However, I took my chances and was not disappointed in the least. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and pointed to an available booth. We got service pretty quickly even on a pretty busy morning. The place was clean and efficient. Food was good: just as good as I remembered in my previous Waffle House experiences.   For all the people complaining about how this isn't like IHOP or Denny's, that's kind of the point! Waffle House started as a truck stop 24 hour diner. And this location proves to continue that wonderful tradition. If you want IHOP or Denny's, just go there!"}
{"text":"Awesome don't have these at home always a treat to find one near me on holiday waitress was pleasant cook was well trained and food was delish thanks Wafflehouse for a happy tummy"}
{"text":"When we got there, no one greeted us or sat us down to our table. Once we got to our table, it was filthy. We got a waitress that was sick and coughing and yawning during our order process. She finally realized that the table was dirty and did a horrible job cleaning it. The menu was very confusing to understand and took over 30 minutes until I heard them tell the cooks our order. I definitely do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Breakfast is always consistent. It is a small noisy place, but breakfast is good and always fast and fresh. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Ok, I'll admit it, I love waffle house.  I know they're not exactly the highest quality establishment but lord almighty... those chocolate chip waffles and hashbrowns seriously make my day. We go here about once a month and consistently have a great experience."}
{"text":"Friendly Service and Good Breakfast Foods  I've been visiting Waffle House locations across he country in and off for going on 20 years.   Affordable prices and friendly staff with actual sweet tea makes it a decent stop when you need a bite.   I always order the All American which is a feast that leaves you stuffed...  Stop by and grab a bite..."}
{"text":"Literally just walked out of this place come here all the time with my husband never have a complaint about Waffle House but today the cook and waiter really had some racial issues.. Markees or mark for short was our waiter I ordered a bowl of chili for my family he gives me 2 packets of crackers with 4 people at my table after watching mark serve other people and not attend to us I nicely asked for more crackers then the cook started with slavery jokes he must've not noticed my husband is half black and knew what he was saying... I have never been treated this way in a restaurant.. My family and I will never go to this Waffle House again we waited 40 minuets for mark to give us a refill of sweet tea very upset and disrespectful cook and waiter will be filing a complaint with corporate Thank you for the horrible slavery jokes and bad day mark and cook"}
{"text":"Absolutely no team work, totally disorganized location. Order was delayed by 30 minutes did not come together. Dirty tables everywhere floor needs to be cleaned."}
{"text":"Great service and food was just what we wanted.  Kids got a kick out the place too"}
{"text":"Very fresh burger very fresh hash browns more healthier than fries that is cooked in oil very good place to eat we had a blast prices are very reasonable and nice people I would recommend it to anyone who wants some nice fresh waffles with a smooth sweet buttermilk taste and would like a fresh midnight snack"}
{"text":"This Waffle House is poorly managed. They chose the busiest time of night to \"clean the grills.\" There were 5 tables waiting to be bussed and over 7 groups waiting to be seated. Three tables who were seated after us were served before us and we had to wait an hour and a half to get our food. I have never had such a terrible experience at a Waffle House. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Strong five for best customer service....my mom is on a wheelchair and they took awesome care of her I was su rprise the place is tooo small...and to top ot off good food and at good price"}
{"text":"I can't see how this place has as many stars as it does. Maybe I came on a bad night.  A night where I wanted to order a chicken wrap and found that if I wanted lettuce or tomatoes then I would be charged extra. When the girl came back and asked if I wanted tomatoes on my salad I asked \"are you going to charge me extra for them?\"  A night where the salad dressing packet was covered in some other type of dressing.   A night where I saw a fly land on the chefs towel and where he proceeded to wipe his spatula with said towel.   A night where I saw a patron at the bar area holding his hand roughly three feet off the bar. Curious to why he was doing that, my questions were answered when he slammed his hand down on a fly (unconfirmed if it was the same fly who rested earlier on the towel) and then lightly brushed the stunned yet permanently disabled insect over the counter.   The saving grace was music over the speakers playing Micheal Jackson. Most likely will not return unless I'm in Phoenix and for some reasons they are the only place on the planet that has waffle mix."}
{"text":"Wow!! What a great and fast cook we have in here ---- awesome. He even made my \"over medium\" eggs over medium. The cook is so organized and clean.  Clean waffle house. Very good breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Arizona, I can always count on some quality Mexican food, In-N-Out, and amusing signs that prohibit firearms in various establishments (#1). Little did I know, they also have quite a few Waffle Houses throughout the greater Phoenix area.  Admittedly, I hadn't seen Waffle Houses this far west, let alone in desert climate. Being that I was also traveling with two west coast friends who hadn't (ever) had Waffle House, suddenly  the desire for greasy, cheap food was appealing - not just for the sake of folks who hadn't had it, but also because we could say we had Waffle House in Arizona.  Walking into the place, it was evident we were in the right company, as the place was crawling with people from Auburn University. The BCS National Championship (#2) brought out many of the orange and navy faithful out west, only to go for a reminder of home in the Waffle House. For a hot minute I felt like I was in Auburn, AL.  The look and feel of this Waffle House was on par with virtually every other experience I've had: the molasses speed of the service, the grittiness of the interior with the smell of grease in the air, the ghastly bathrooms, and Southern patrons. The prices felt a tad higher, but I imagine they just creep up the further west one goes (#3).  In the end, it comes down to the food. Waffle House is a destination for those who seek greasy food at cheapo prices during all hours of the day/night. Yet, for throughout our meal, most of the food was just bland. My biscuits and gravy were definitely lacking seasoning and my beloved hash browns were surprisingly on the bland side. I could tell my friends were scurrying along with their meal of grits and raisin toast and hardly raving about their food.  One could blame it on the fact I was in Arizona, but it still is technically the South (west). In the end, my stellar WH experiences in Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas can only confirm that not all WHs are built the same. 2.5 stars, with the additional bump of *#3* below.  _______ (#1) What? Did you think I was kidding? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f6mQYyU_ga0DVRuRZhkmfQ?select=O9Tae0X_t_MOaP1yhpslUQ (#2) That's College Football for all of you knuckle heads.

{"text":"Long wait. Eeeems like the service is inexperienced with the simple tasks they are doing ."}
{"text":"My first time at any Waffle House and I came in just to get that... a waffle.  I already had dinner and I consider waffles to be like a dessert.  Especially because I can't see paying upwards of $10 at some other trendy breakfast places for flapjacks, French toast, or waffles.    The waffles here are $3.25 and you get a waffle.  It's not Belgian but it's a pretty good waffle.  The syrup is good and the butter.. well, it isn't real butter but it still tastes fine.  I was happy with my waffle.    The service was friendly and fast.  Overall, a great experience for my first time at Waffle House."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Waffle House. The service was friendly enough and our waitress Andrea was helpful in explaining the pricing of dishes. I had CheeseNEggs and my boyfriend got waffles and hashbrowns. He seemed to enjoy his and mine was ok, but I have to be honest - I could make better breakfast at home. I was expecting WH to be cheaper than it actually was considering the food isn't outstanding. When I go out to breakfast (and this might be just me) but I expect to get food I can't compare to my own homecooked selection. But I guess it's a place to consider if you want fast service and decent food."}
{"text":"We had fantastic service and wonderful food!  The cook was a peach!  Left with our bellies full but wanting to keep eating what was on our plates."}
{"text":"I have't been to a Waffle House in 20 years... Now I remember why.  If you're looking quick, cheap, greasy spoon type food... Don't come here, it falls far below that standard.  Not any cheaper than a comparable meal at Ihop or Denny's, with much lower quality. The food at Flying J and Petro blows Waffle House out of the water.  Thin chewy waffles, undercooked hash browns, pasty sausage gravy, super salty diaphanous bacon...all rubbish.  Even the butter was some sort of \"butter like\" spread in an individual serving tub.  The premises were wet. Having come off 4 days of rain I was willing to give some latitude. Then I encountered the smell.  Upon peering behind the counter I discovered a small marsh which, at a guess, was caused by backup or overflow from the dishwasher.  Why won't yelp allow me to give a zero rating?"}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was terrible, waitress did not listen to the order we gave her. Why is it that nobody listens to people order, one think the juke box was so loud I am surprised anyone heard the orders"}
{"text":"Don't judge me. I love this place. I love that I have to drive through the parking lot of the truck stop to get to it. I love that the same staff has been there for years and they remember you if you have come in more than twice in the last year. I love the 'tude of the place (yes even though it's a chain) and by all reason, it has no right to have an attitude. I love that the servers have to stand behind a little imaginary line on the floor and yell out the orders to the cooks. I love how the cooks don't actually have tickets to reference, but rather have to set up plates with their secret Waffle House codes to know what orders are up. I love that the hash-browns are made with one part potato and one part greasy stuff, then stuffed in to the perfectly round molds, so when they hit your plate they are like little crunchy hokey pucks. I love that you can get the all you can eat menu, if you simply can't decide whether you want a waffle, an omelet, grits, or a hamburger. I love that regardless of the time of day or night, you are guaranteed to see something that makes your inner teenager summon up your best valley girl \"oh maw gawd!!\" I love that they will let a  homeless guy sit at the end chair to get warm and have a pork chop. I love the weird collection of music on the jukebox and the fact that they actually have multiple WH mixed CDs. And most of all, I love that when you order a pecan waffle with extra pecans, they don't look at you oddly. They simply add as many pecans to the batter that will fit on the griddle and when they shut the lid, the nuts get toasted as the waffle cooks. I love this place."}
{"text":"Open late and by all the strip clubs, Danny our server was awesome great customer service skills. The waffle I had had strawberries infused in it sooooo good.  5 stars to Danny our late night man."}
{"text":"Not all Waffle Houses are the same, this one always seems a little bit better. Food is solid, service is excellent and friendly and they're always open! LOVE IT.   I mean a Waffle House is pretty much a Waffle House... but this location was a regular haunt for me and my friends for years when I lived in 'Tukee... I don't live close by anymore but when I'm nearby I wouldn't hesitate to stop by. It's much nicer of a location than the one on baseline & I-10"}
{"text":"What can you say about any Waffle House. They do an excellent job at being what they are trying to be. I always enjoy the food and the service. If you're expecting it to be something it isn't then you'll likely be disappointed. I will go back to this one and enjoy every greasy morsel."}
{"text":"Love the cheese and eggs. Sometimes the cooks are lazy bit other times it's good. Usually clean but can use some more  cleaning at times."}
{"text":"C'mon!  If you don't get an All the Way Hashbrowns, you don't know what you're missing out.  Or possibly missing tastebuds."}
{"text":"We stopped at Waffle House as our last stop of the night before heading across the street to our hotel to get some sleep -- The place was packed but we got a table right away.   The server was very sweet and knew just how to handle our inebriated friend who was a bit uncooperative.   We were in and out in less than 40 minutes (table of 6), and our bellies were full with warm, fresh waffles!"}
{"text":"Great location to soak up some drink before you go home to pass out.   The staff can be nice or rude depending on you. (I prefer rude)  The food is good, nothing pretentious or assuming. You get what they give you and you eat it.   I don't think I would bring Mom for Sunday Breakfast but for a quick bite, it hits the spot. Better then Denny's unless you want your Superbird or French Toast.   The waitress was even nice enough to call a cab for us."}
{"text":"Place was ok. Too much oil in the omelette unless you ask for light oil. Food tastes ok if you are in a hurry. Friendly service. If you have more time to eat you should go over to the peppersauce cafe."}
{"text":"This restaurant in this location was the absolutely worst waffle house I have ever been to. I ordered a waffle and 30 minutes later it was still not ready. I asked them what is going on with the waffle and they said the waffle irons have not be cleaned in 2 days! Finally, I got my waffle and and I turned it over a it was blacker than my car but I ate a small piece of it and it was raw. Me and my family were so mad we kinda sorta went off on them and we made them not include the waffle in our bill. Now we are driving home mad and hungry writing this yelp review. #healthdepartment"}
{"text":"We arrived a little before 4:30am and the employees were out behind the restaurant smoking. No one washed their hands before serving us- although the cook did put on gloves. We were the only customers and one of the employees went and started playing the juke box, VERY loud. We asked if they could turn it down and were told that was not possible. They did not have any decaf coffee, nor did they offer to make some. Our server was rude and seemed to wish we would leave. $29 for two simple breakfasts was a total ripoff, save your money, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My first time ever to eat at the waffle house.  The foods was good,  fast,  made the way I ordered it. Coffee was super yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this place this morning with the family.  Manager/owner runs a tight ship and treats his employees with respect.  Fast clean courteous and all of our orders were perfect and delicious!   Great experience!  Going to start going here with the family more often! Thanks  Waffle House on Bell and I-17!"}
{"text":"Sure it's a cute little diner set up...sure they make your food in front of you...sure they have adorable mini juke boxes on every table. But please tell me WHY do they use the kraft cheese singles when I ask for some covered hash browns?? That plastic square shaped cheese... I will never understand. But will I come back to Waffle House again? Probably"}
{"text":"Very average.  Food was ok,  service was fast and friendly but definitely felt a little rushed.  It was next to our hotel and served its purpose."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try waffle house since I moved here because we dont have them in San Diego to my knowledge.  Well, really, my gf has been telling me how great they are \"after a night of partying\"... and we don't party all that much so Saturday night, after a LONG night we decided to go with our neighbor, and it must have been about 3 am (technically Sunday).  So we finally get there and we go ahead and have a seat because there is no sign telling us to wait to be seated.  There are no menus and the only table available is dirty with dishes left over from the last patrons. But we figured, its late and they probably just left.  So we sat and waited to be greeted/drink order taken/table cleaned?  Something?  Anything??  HELLO!?!?!    Meanwhile the waitress is waiting on people sitting at the counter, truckers I guess? -she's chattin it up and having a gay old time.  Finally after about 15 to 20 mins ( felt like an eternity, especially at 3 am) we got up and left and shouted a big THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING as I left.   Wow... It will have to be a seriously long night before I ATTEMPT to eat there again.  I'm told \"the other locations are not like that\".  I'll believe that when and if I see it.  PS, IHOP is so good at 3:30 am!!!  I dont care if its a chain... it hit the spot  and they don't pretend that you're invisible.  And if I could give this Waffle House NO stars I would."}
{"text":"I like my hash browns covered, chunked, smothered, and diced. Then I order a plain waffle with butter and syrup. Yum! Granted there's always some shady people hanging around but it just adds to the adventure."}
{"text":"It's a decent place for food. My friend loves this place. I have to hand it to this place for being 24 hours though. It's like when everything else is closed, you can always come here. You might run into a lot of drunk people or some sketchy people but yeah... those are the ones coming in at 4am. And the question you have to ask yourself is... what are you doing and awake at 4am as well? But decent food, convenient and not overly expensive. It serves its purpose for you crazy people out there.  I also think it's cheaper and better than Denny's."}
{"text":"This is the good Waffle House! It's cleaner and service is faster than the other ones I been to.  Waffle House has some pretty cheap food. I always and usually go for the Hashbrowns all the way. It's only $4... and it's a lot of food with ham, gravy, chili, potatoes, jalapenos, mushrooms, etc. Probably not the healthiest food but you can't have everything.  The menu has a good variety from burgers to waffles to pancakes to steak and eggs and a lot of stuff that you would expect for breakfast and lunch. And this place opens late! Actually, it could be 24 hours... I think I went to one at 3 a.m. before....  It's a cheap late night eats place. You know what you are getting into when you come here. ;)"}
{"text":"Food was good and came out quickly, portion size was big, price was cheap, and service is great. Waitress got me everything I need and checked up on me when needed; she didn't overwhelm me and at the same time didn't forget about me. Atmosphere is calming and friendly. Great place to unwind and enjoy a great breakfast."}
{"text":"My friends and I had our first visit to a Waffle House this week for a late-night nibble.  We were surprised when we asked the waitress (who was super nice) what was good, she said, \"Not the waffles.\"  We ordered a regular waffle anyway and it looked and tasted like a big Eggo.  It wasn't that great, but it wasn't expensive at all, so we got what we paid for.  I'm sure it's great for drunk people late at night."}
{"text":"This is a good place for breakfast when you are traveling in Phoenix. The menu is small, but the food is good. How many places can you find Raisin Toast??? My only complaint was that some of the wait-staff didn't pay attention when I gave my order and I sometimes had to ask for my check. Otherwise, it's a good, inexpensive breakfast!"}
{"text":"What can I say. I looooove Waffle House. I wish they had one in Southern California. The coffee, the hash browns, the bacon, the chocolate pie and yes of course the amazing waffles. The service is always on point too. The first time I had Waffle House my boyfriend drove me six hours just to try it and I just fell in love. Now whenever I'm in Arizona or any state that has it I'm sure to make a stop before coming back home"}
{"text":"There are Waffle Houses all over the U.S. but this one is particularly different for two reasons.  One, it's located across from Tempe's favorite outlet mall, yet the restaurant is \"technically\" in Guadalupe. That means you pay higher sales tax on your meal than you would across the street. I believe it's in the 10% range.  Also, if you go there late enough you can catch a stripper in there eating a meal after her stint next door at Christie's.   Parking is not great, particularly on a weekend morning and the place is not very large so sometimes the line goes out the door on weekends...For a Waffle House?  I've found that Waffle Houses are not inexpensive, they are merely convenient.   You can find better eggs, better steaks and better meals elsewhere. It's simply not worth waiting in line for on Saturday morning.   At 2 am however, when you crave a hot pecan waffle and could run into a stripper in 4 inch heels, Baseline Waffle House could be an interesting place."}
{"text":"Yes. Five stars for Waffle House. Absolutely the best experience I have ever had at a Waffle House. The were busy but the crew was amazing. Friendly. Warm. Asking how everything was. Interacting with customers. The mood was fun and friendly. Service was fast and fold prepared perfectly. Two obvious new people training on the crew and the old schoolers were patient with the newbies. They were all clicking and having fun. The energy in this place is amazing this morning. In a world of 3 star waffle houses, they deserve the 3.5 they have earned on Yelp and are holding strong! Worth the little extra drive to bypass the 3 star ones!"}
{"text":"I visited the waffle house in Huntersville  with a party of 3 and the server was rushing us to order and when she first approached table  she did so on her cell phone. The one of the people say I want 2 waffles  so he get 1  then one of the people was in  wheel chair so the whole time she say what he want. Well he capable of hearing and speach next time try sir what can I get u. Then his coffee was cold then one of the people ask for ketchup which was brought so long after we ask for it was done eating"}
{"text":"Its a beautiful day so I'm out on the motorcycle for about 4 hours and its time to get something to eat; unfortunately its Easter Sunday so not that many places are open.  Fortunately I remember that there is a Waffle House at I-90 and Route 44.  I may lose some of my foodie cred, but even though I generally don't like chain restaurants, I do have a soft spot for the Waffle House.   This trip I ordered a waffle and a medium hashbrowns scattered and capped (with mushrooms added.  The waffle is a large disc, fairly thin with a good slightly sweet flavor.  The waffle has a softer outside, but the inside is fluffy and perfect to soak up the syrup.  The hashbrowns are exactly what they should be, crisped up on the grill with good potato taste, but not too greasy.  There are plenty of jokes about Waffle Houses, but I have found that they are good road food, the food is good, service is friendly and fast, your order is cooked fresh and served quickly; prices are good and most of the time the restaurants are clean.   You can count on the Waffle House to give good, decent food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I have given this place so many chances and now I am done with this location and maybe Waffle House in general.  The skinny  By no means do I expect Waffle House to be a 5 star restaurant but what I do expect is a clean and friendly place and this place never gets it right I have been there 6 times (no car closest food chain)  as I work around the corner. Out of those 6x only once did I see a worker that I had seen before this place seems to have a high turnover rate. They made a few mistakes such as giving me the wrong burger (I order the lunch special 5$ double burger with drink combo) they tried to charge me for wrong burger and I had to tell them that I ordered special which I always say can I have the 5$ burger special to avoid confusion after a brief argument she gave me the special price. The food is ok I don't expect it to be great but it's not bad. The very last time I went there, there was 2 employees one cool one waitress they seemed to be texting and getting calls from friends on the work line as it kept going off and they would have small quiet conversations with. When I ordered the special the cook seemed to be upset over me disrupting his convo he finished my burger literally in 2 minutes he gave me a small plate with just burger no hash browns and my drink. He asked how my burger tasted I advised it seemed under cooked and not that great which he laughed and walked away I didn't finish burger. When I went up to pay she charged me for the special I let her know I did order the special and that  I didn't get my hash browns she deducted .60c when I asked if that's how much hash browns cost she replied rudely and barked yes I paid with no tip and as I was leaving could hear her complain about it I let them know how I felt and how unprofessional they were and left. The cook was also cursing out loud as he thought I would be cool enough to not say anything.  Even if I was starving and had a free lunch coupon would I ever go back to this place."}
{"text":"I've only had this place once and got food poisoning. Will never have again. The place is old and run down, better off going to McDonalds or Denny's"}
{"text":"Consistency is the name of the game at the local Waffle House.  Cheap, filling, and always good first thing in the morning, it's our favorite place to crash in the mornings. Gone are the days of \"cash only\", as they now except most major credit and debit cards.  The staff are always quick with a \"hon\" or \"sugar\", which brings us back to the ol' southern charm we hear about often! Are you going to be served the greatest breakfast/diner meal you've ever had?  Heck no!  But you'll get what you ordered, and more than you paid for!  My \"usual\" is the All Star Breakfast plate; 2 your-way eggs, choice meat, choice hashbrowns or grits, toast, and a waffle.  I go for the hashbrowns smothered and covered.  all for about $6.50!   It is what it is, and I find it to be delish!   Noosh!"}
{"text":"Oh, Waffle House... I don't even know what to say. Living in California, we are deprived of your cheap diner food. My cousin calls me crazy for liking it so much, but I can't help it. When you have a 24-hour diner that serves up some cheap breakfast in good sized portions, you can't help but like it. ESPECIALLY, considering they have some AMAZINGLY good grits! Prices vary depending on the state you're in, for obvious reasons, but the food is generally consistent. I had gone to one other Az location last year, but this particular location hit the spot! $9 for their all-star breakfast (additional cost if you want to upgrade your waffle). Overall, a good place to eat if you aren't looking for anything fancy or upscale or if you just want to get something quick, tasty, and CHEAP!  California... PLEASE step your diner game up!"}
{"text":"Most of these places are the same. This one was like eating in an ice box or a walk in cooler. The servers were very attentive and our food came out super fast. It was packed with people and more coming in to order food to go. We all went with breakfast options including the hash browns. I will always be impressed with the cooks at these places. The servers just shout out the order, \"hash browns smothered, covered, chunked...\" I would end up making scrambled eggs all the time."}
{"text":"You've been to one Waffle House you've been to them all.   Good people work there, the food is really good. I ordered the all star which comes with: A waffle, egg and cheese, bacon, cinnamon raisin toast, hash browns and OJ. The food at these places are aways a little bit greasy but you know thats just some extra lovin from the south.   The waitress was a little all over the place, was not much of a fan. However, they were busy which they usually are. I love this place for breakfast though. Every time I am down south I eat at one of these."}
{"text":"I like their grits and their basic sunny side.their waffle is yummy yum. besides their price not too bad. I HAD 2 sunny side and bread and waw whole day i felt full and the portions were huge  i even had some to go for 6 dollars they also had 8$.... huge waffle so delish  yummy waffle i call it"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick dinner driving back home from Florida. I haven't been to a Waffle House in about 2 years.  The place is semi clean (waitress was sweeping after we arrived), located a short distance from the freeway. Wasn't busy. Food was served to my parents, 2 steak melts with hash browns. They enjoyed theirs. Mine came about 5 minutes later. A Texas toast chicken melt and I got grits as my side. Sandwich was surprisingly good. Hot and melty with bacon and grilled onions on top of grilled Texas toast. My grits were good after I added butter and salt. You know, the good stuff. Overall it was decent. Nothing to write home about. It's a nice Waffle House with good quick food for a good price. 3 dinners 2 pops for 31$ not including tip. Can't complain too much. Their breakfast looks good. Maple Pecan or blueberry waffles hrmmmm sounds yummo. I'll be back"}
{"text":"We waited about 30 minutes to be seated... no biggie... waited another 30 minutes for the food only to have the wrong order brought to us. So instead of waiting longer, we left without eating... Probably a good thing as I had ordered steak and eggs and caught a glimpse of what I think was their \"steak.\" It resembled a Jack Link's kippered beef product in both size and texture... Oh, did I mention the B rating from the Dept. of Health... I feel a need to point out that the dynamic I observed with the employees indicates management issues and not necessarily an issue with the staff. My recommendation... stay away from this one.. far away."}
{"text":"This isn't the best waffle house in the area. We went there to try a different one. We sat at the counter and felt uncomfortable the whole time. The manager, I'm assuming, was yelling and barking orders at the staff the whole time. We felt bad for the other cook working with her. When we got our food it wasn't comparable to other waffle house restaurants. We got our food really spread out too. My friend got her hash  browns first (which weren't as good as other locations) then 5 minutes later I got my biscuits and gravy. As we were finishing those we remembered we had ordered waffles. We got those like 10 minutes after all the other food. Mine was like half over done. It was Medioric. Overall, mehh.  We wouldn't go to this one again."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and polite, quick to give you your bill stating that there is no rush, but then they never follow back up with you. That's a problem when you need a drink refill.  The most notable was cleanliness, which is why they only received 3 stars. I observed staff clean the table, but when seated I had to wipe off benches (gritty & sticky), as well as the table. The floor was also swept, but remained littered with crumbs.  May consider returning, but there are other restaurants in the area who also serve breakfast."}
{"text":"The food was good and reasonably priced. The place is a diner. It's a little small. There were already menus on the table. But it's not the full menu, you have to ask for one. Only complaint is I received my waffle a couple minutes before the rest of my food. Would have liked to get it all at once."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving Waffle House 5 stars! But, this place rocks! Impressed that the server thoroughly cleaned the top of the table, sides of the table, and even the seats before seating us. Great service, food tasted great. One minor problem with the order: the server didn't give one person in my party the choice between hash browns and grits.  Bacon is crisp. Eggs cooked just right. Almost perfect experience."}
{"text":"Typical Waffle House. Looks like some place out of a horror movie. Lol The food was ok. I ask a Ihop kinda girl! The staff was friendly, I guess, no smiles, just spoke. Not an atmosphere I would frequent. I only went for the smothered covered hash browns, and they weren't anything to go crazy over."}
{"text":"Like cheap, greasy, filling food? This is the place to hit up. Great for late nights after the bar/club when you get sick of denny's or ihop. Get yourself some steak, hash and waffles drenched in syrup. Don't forget the sweet tea to wash it all down. I've been to different waffle houses across 4 different states and they're all pretty much the same."}
{"text":"Service was average. Waitress was nice, but kept forgetting to bring req'd items to the table. Although the place was packed full of people, the temperature of the food was good, food was timely and the price was right. Overall satisfaction."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see Waffle House still listed at this address as it's been located down the street fir years.  I'll have to report this one to Yelp as closed."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times this trip (so far) and all three have been good.  Plus I've eaten here on previous trips at least a coupla times.  I've had  breakfasts, steak and eggs, chili, and pork chops with eggs most notably.  See photos of all.   Surprisingly, the only thing that was a disappointment was the waffle, a bit incongruous considering their name and assumably their claim to fame is the waffle.  Most places would be $10 and up for steak or pork chops.  Here it's closer to $8, depending on the size you get.  Both were perfectly good.  And there just aren't a lot of places that offer grits.  They do and they're good.  So are the biscuits and gravy, Texas Toast and chili.    The service has always been good and even the cooks are friendly.  It's clean and the tabletops aren't sticky, no easy task to clean considering the amount of syrup that passes over these tables.  This is one of those chains I make an exception for because they are reasonable, have good food, and are pretty consistant.  Since there are none in San Diego, I will continue to enjoy this one on my trips to the Mesa, Az area."}
{"text":"I'm am use to a certain level of untidiness at Waffle Houses in general, but this morning was by far a clear indication I need to stop eating here. There were a number of flies as well as a couple of roaches in clear sight. One roach was even at the register as the serve packaged my food and collected my money. Please do better Waffle House Your $3 breakfast bowl is amazing, your pest control is lacking!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Good food with just enough grease. Clean facilities. Good portion sizes"}
{"text":"This is the worst Waffle House I have ever been to. Over easy came over hard, toast was stale bread, hash browns were undercooked and cold. I paid for the coffee and left. In won't be back."}
{"text":"A waffle, eggs and hashbrowns to go was not such a good idea.  Never eat waffles to go as they soggy.  I have to admit it wasn't bad but I'd rather eat my waffles at the restaurant next time to enjoy them crispier. :)"}
{"text":"So an old faithful after a long night! I stick with the all American which is a waffle, eggs I get a side of home fries smothered and covered with onions and cheese bacon and toast.  What makes this Waffle House unique is the staff is just as upbeat as the music as they have playing in the background that definitely took me back to my college days. They a security guard that watches the parking lot and to make sure the after club folks don't get out of hand!"}
{"text":"We tried the store over Avondale and it was fine but this store BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER! We stayed right next to the bell location but it didn't \"look safe\" according to my wife so we came over here. Great location (area), staff was friendly and store was super clean."}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast with big portions at a very reasonable price!  The staff are super friendly and made me feel at home."}
{"text":"Came to this location late at night and was greeted by the friendly staff. Very affordable prices and good food! They even have a dollar menu! I would come back!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. The team at this location works well together and the energy is catching.  They are across from Arizona Mills Mall. Good location to eat."}
{"text":"Waffle House was great. Service was quick and the food was delicious. During my time here, a big group of people came in on a very busy day. They realized it would probably be a long wait and left immediately. Instead of letting them leave and choose a different restaurant, a worker ran outside and told them a table was about to open up. I was very impressed by this. I would definitely recommend Waffle House for a quick and tasty breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to locations for Waffle House in North Charlotte. My other geographic options are the one near Speedway Blvd in Concord and the one off north Tryon street in University City ( near Ikea). All three locations have the updated WH style. This location on Hankins road, is easy to get to and the service is friendly. The restaurant and bathrooms are clean too.  I only get the All-Star from WH. For those who don't know, this is a big breakfast that includes a waffle :-), your choice of bacon or sausage, your choice of grits or hash browns AND toast. This time I got bacon and hash browns with my All-Star, my hash browns included jalapeños , onions and cheese. There's lots of variations you can do with your waffle and hash browns.  If you don't know WH, there's usually a juke box ( dollar bills only), you seat yourself, there IS NO real healthy substitutions, so this is not the place to go on a diet. Waffle House officialdom also know that Waffle House  serves a full menu 24 hours a day."}
{"text":"The staff are very very nice however there was hair in my food and hair my another persons orange juice so I cannot justify a good review. Will not be returning. Go to Cracker Barrel down the road."}
{"text":"OK, I finally drove in to a Waffle House.  They have managed to keep the stereotypical diner in place right down to the cast of characters working there.  I got a patty melt on Texas toast, a side of smothered hash browns and an iced tea.  The sandwich was good the hash browns and onions were greasy and undercooked.  Service was fine.  It isn't as cheap a place to eat as it looks if you are hungry because every thing is extra.  The closest comparison I can come up with is Denny's which ranges from 1.5 to 4 depending on which one you go to.  This would be in the middle of that range."}
{"text":"Although my server was fantastic, this place was filthy and dirty. There were empty plates on every table, food all over the floor. Napkins and paper towels all over the place. Behind the counter there was food all over the floor. The food was so salty it was inedible, I should of stuck with my gut instincts and ran out the door after I walked in!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would!! In all my years I have never seen a restaurant this poorly ran. I entered the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. There were no other customers in the establishment however there were at least 10 employees standing around talking. The staff acted as if we were not there they were either on cell phones making person calls or screaming at each other from opposite ends of the store. The supervisor appeared to be all of 18 years old and decided to re-tuck his uniform in requiring him to unbuttoned his pants and showcase his underwear in the middle of the dining room floor. After about 40 mins. a couple with their child entered the parking lot the supervisor said \"Let's tell them we're out of waffles\" and the entire staff laughed. This was a disgusting act of customer service, corporate really needs to look into closing this location they,are over staffed without any customers."}
{"text":"Okay, so I grew up thinking these places were dirty little places to dine.  I ate @ this location on New Year's morning thanks to a visiting friend, Jenny from SF.  She hearts WH.  Anyway, I was surprised at how clean it was, no fancy furniture, but clean booths and tables.  There were a lot of people waiting, but they moved people in / out efficiently.    Coffee awaited us complete with sweetener/ cream.  Yay coffee.  This probably helped make the wait seem less.  There are a lot of smaller tables/ booths, so not real good for a large group.  The kitchen is open to the dining area, so you can see the cooks make your food.    We ordered a single waffle and side of bacon.  I didn't realize they served lunch/dinner, too.  The waffle was just the right side, and they made my bacon crispy like I asked.  The cooks actually seemed to be having a good time cooking up a storm of bacon, waffles, eggs, etc.    Our food came out fast, hot and delicious.  I can officially say I am a fan, and will return to WH for breakfast whenever I get the chance.  We got out of there with 2 waffle breakfasts, sides of bacon, and drinks for under $15 for the two of us."}
{"text":"Love the waffle house fun friendly and yummy waffles cant go wrong here or at least so far."}
{"text":"In my 37 years I have never been to a Waffle house, I know crazy right?? Went their sat night and being a true geek sat at the counter to watch the cooking go down.  I of course ordered a waffle with chocolate chips & whipped cream,,yea that's how I like it! Got me some loaded hash browns with ham & onions and coffee, man so good luv it!!! Service was fast and friendly; it was great late night snack on a Sat Night! Ill will be back!"}
{"text":"Every WH is different, depends on the cook and the management. I just moved from houston and they dont have the best WH's there as much as i love the place. When my husband and I recently moved to AZ we were skeptical about trying it on the west coast. I am so glad I came here, I like my waffle cooked light and my hashbrowns in the ring and my sausage cooked a little darker/longer/ and they cooked it perfectly. The food is great and reasonable priced. The waffles are SOOO good, love them. Now of course the best WH are located in ATL, where I visited and it was the best but Avondale will do just fine for now"}
{"text":"During my meal with my son at the Deer Valley location of the Waffle House, I observed many health code violations including but not limited too: employees eating on the line and returning to cook and serve food with out washing their hands, texting or using their cell phones on the line while their cooking with gloves on but not replacing them after they touched their personal phones (including the owner Jim). This observer then expressed concerns to the employee eating bacon on the line with her fingers and serving patrons without washing her hands. She was standing next to this observer on the line, so while I was eating with my son, she was eating and serving other patrons. She then walked over to the manager to inform her of my concerns. I observed her, the manager, and another employee rolling their eyes, laughing, and looking back and forth at this observer. Not once did the manager approach this observer a paying patron about the concerns.   Precisely 10 minutes after the manager was informed of my concerns, the owner Jim walked over to express that he appreciated my concerns. This observer further expressed dissatisfaction with their practices here at this Waffle House, as this observer frequently eats here. Not once did the owner or manager ask his staff to stop what they were doing and go wash their hands, nor did the owner himself, quite a disappointment and disgusting.   Overall, this experience was very unprofessional and a hospitality nightmare! This observer will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Yum yum... I *heart* Waffle House!   It's cheap, fresh food, fast... 24 hours a day.  What's not to like?  Sure, sometimes it's a lil greasy but, it's not as bad as some and in a 24 hour breakfast joint like this, a lil grease is to be expected.     Trust me and try the biscuits and gravy (gluttony) or plain grilled chicken sandwich (healthier)... they delish!  That being said, they have a pretty good salad, if you're ever in an no-grease mood while at Waffle House. And don't get the waffles... they're weirdly one of the worst things on the menu!  Good people watching and juke box selections at this location... especially as it's right next door to a strip club!  Woot woot!  See ya there!"}

{"text":"I've never experienced such bad customer service until I stepped into Waffle House and met Audrey.  As soon as we walked in, so rude. When we sat down waited to be seated she asked us how many and a name. After we told her 4 people and our name she rolled her eyes and said \"I'm suppose to be off the clock\". And asked our name again, so rudely.  Our server amber, she was okay. She seemed more occupied with literally everyone else in the restaurant except ours, even as we are ordering.   The food was good but if I wasn't craving waffles, we would have left. The online menu is nothing like the actual menu. False advertisement!!! For a Waffle House, they only have two kinds. Pretty pricey for the quality.  Waffles were mediocre at most for a Waffle House."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy my experience here. Unfortunately, the service was very slow. I ordered bacon, grits and cinnamon toast. My boyfriend ordered the Grand Slam and his meal came out before my order and then when my bacon and toast came, I had to wait for my grits. I really wanted to give this location another try but I'll be taking my business back to the Independence location. Melvin at the Independence location gives the BEST service!!"}
{"text":"I go in and it's busy. They say I cN have his booth when it's cleaned off. People walk in after I've been waiting and offer the table I was waiting for to them. I drove like 15 miles to eat here. Not cool won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed that an establishment that is known to be \"family friendly\" allows employees to be so disgustingly rude. My children (ages run from 13-18) were treated so rudely and found hair cooked into their meals. Unfortunately I am out of town at the moment, but post an update when I get back and have to opportunity to speak my kids and the restrauant manager and waitress."}
{"text":"This is such a great breakfast place when you're traveling through Arizona.  We loved the breakfast.  Our server, Akira was an absolute doll.  We had an egg breakfast with waffles.  Everything was perfectly made.  The coffee was the best!"}

{"text":"Me and my mother visited this Waffle House for an early morning/late night snack. The food was good. The staff was super friendly and the price was reasonable. However the riff-raff that lingered around, both inside and out made things very uncomfortable. One guy, who Im sure has been a patient at the state hospital at some point, sat himself down at our table and began telling us his whole (imaginary) life story while another across the room said \"mmmm\" everytime we took a bite of our food!!"}

{"text":"This place was packed because of Father's Day which made for a festive environment. We ended up sitting at the counter which gave us an up close view to all the action.  Amazingly,  the chefs could keep up with the orders that were being barked to them as there was no apparent ticket system and they kept up with the orders well as far as we could tell.  Our food did not take long and the staff, while clearly in the weeds, were all upbeat and seemed to genuinely enjoy the large number of people.   By WH standards I suppose this location is clean enough but we noticed a few flies sitting on a mans back just lounging, lol, but really,  almost wouldn't feel like a WH without some flies darting about :).    Now the food, according to the fam, was the bomb.  I just had coffee and it was ok, but not strong enough for me but was fresh tasting at least.  The wife and son 1 had the waffle with chocolate chips and son 2 had a texas sandwich which had egg and bacon.   They loved  it.  My wife was extremely complimentary indicating it was the best waffle she's had out.  Ummm, say that into my good ear please,  lol.  She doesn't care for the overly thick cakey waffles and these are thinner than most I've seen but she loved it saying it was fluffy enough and the outer part had a crispness to it that just really took the butter and syrup well.  Same with son 1, and he's had his fair share of waffles too!  The sandwich looked simple enough but son 2 said it was great, so it was shark eyes all around!    I would definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff. Manager is silly and they all got along with each other. The manager even gave us a box of chocolates for our wait"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, affordable, and delicious. The staff was super sweet and friendly, but the service was slow. Personally, I didn't mind, but I just want everyone to know that their service was maybe a 5.2/10. They were all really nice though so that was a plus. It was my first time here and I came with my friends after a party around 3 am on a Saturday night. Well, I guess Sunday.   Anyways.. We got there and it wasn't all that packed. There were some people, but not enough where the service was acceptably slow. I was waiting for my food for awhile and I was super hungry. The ambience was very comforting for some reason. It wasn't fancy, but it wasn't ugly. I can't explain it? It just gave me a good vibe being in there. I ordered a waffle and hashbrown. When our food finally came I was so excited. Our waitress surprised us with extra hashbrowns. My face lit up so bright haha. Great times.   Man, I also feel like cute black guys are always going there around that time lol. I regret not getting this guy's number last night. I really should've.. But trust and believe I will be back!!! Go to the Waffle House everyone! Good food, attractive other customers, and super sweet staff. Service could be sped up, but it was understandable why the service was slow. It was 3 am I'm sure they were tired!"}
{"text":"First time dinner visit. Ordered the hamburger with hash browms, they don't have fries. Got back to hotel with food. My mistake, I should've checked before I left. There was No fork to eat the hash browns, no napkins, and no ketchup. the Burger was okay, guess I should stick to their waffles."}
{"text":"It is the same at every one; food is fast as service friendly; I love how the call in the orders and the juke box. I could not work here because I would forget the orders! When you visit try one of the Waffle House songs on the juke box! Food is always good; you know what you will get!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast after stopping by a different location to eat. We walked in and was greeted by all the staff members which were very friendly and helpful. We were given a table and drinks immediately. We finally decided what we wanted to eat it within five minutes of ordering our food was hot fresh and at our table.   This is all we ask for a friendly service, a good meal and quick. If you're looking for breakfast lunch or dinner and have a quick with the friendly staff I would recommend this place.  I am sure others have had different experiences here, but as far as my experience I will be returning to this Waffle House."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! I have been in this business for 15+ years and have never seen such a pathetic example of team work. All 3 of you just sat there talking about how proud u where to not be white and making complete jokes of yourself. Funny thing is the only person working in the whole damn place was an older white gentlemen named Steve. Steve you where amazing and deserve a better job and team then the crap I witnessed. I will NEVER STEP FOOT IN THIS SHIT WHOLE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"The vents were so dusty. The grits tasted old and nasty. Asked for super crispy bacon and it came out super fatty and not crisp. Menus were sticky. Booths were just not clean. Is it really that hard to wipe down everything?!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great value! Great food! Love waffle house! Left a good tip for my very awesome server.  My coffee cup was never empty! And was clean and friendly! Was greeted right away!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a week but there are some new people here that just don't get customer service. I had to walk out one day after 15 minutes and nobody acknowledge me or offer me coffee. I won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Cleanliness a 0.    Ick, ick, ick.  Couldn't stand to eat the meal after noticing the crickets crawling around the floor and hairballs rolling like tumbleweeds.    Vom."}
{"text":"Waffle House is a cultural foundation in America.  Have to stop my at least once a year to maintain citizenship."}
{"text":"Delicious food, go for the breakfast! If you ask for the hash browns extra crispy they are CRISPY!!!"}
{"text":"Poor service, waitress forgot to bring drinks. Food arrived before we got our drinks. Burnt waffle, which I refused and didn't pay for. Lack of overall customer service, the few that were working were too interested in gossiping than actually helping the customers in the store"}
{"text":"If you are the franchise owner of this waffle house you should really reach out to me. Your being robbed blind."}
{"text":"Always friendly staff and service. Great price and consistent food. Remember, this is a diner with diner food. With that said the food is consistent and decent price. Although the   portions are small there's nothing like getting breakfast 24hrs and 8 different types of hashbrowns!"}
{"text":"Always friendly staff and service. Great price and consistently good food. Nothing like getting breakfast 24hrs and 8 different types of hashbrowns. Working on trying every one!"}
{"text":"Want diner food with friendly staff and fun people watching? Waffle House is where it's at! Yes, the food is typical diner food - i.e. a little grease, a little butter, a lot o' calories and tasty!  Just plan a day of walking around or heading on over to the gym and you'll be golden.    There was a bit of a wait to get seated here, but they had a list and moved through cleaning up tables and getting people seated in a quick and efficient manner. Once it was our turn we were seated at the counter where our waitress, Mama Jude (highly doubt that's her real name, but it doesn't really matter does it?), was amazingly friendly, joked around with us and made sure we were well cared for from start to finish.   We both had the All Star platter.  I opted for cheese in my grits, a chocolate chip waffle, eggs over easy and sausage patties.  He opted for cheese in his grits and eggs, a plain waffle, scrambled eggs and ham. Everything was cooked exactly as ordered and tasted great.  Yes, we walked around the rest of the day to work it off, but it was worth it!  Overall: A Walk in knowing that you are getting diner food made on a grill and you'll be good to go!  Ask for Mama Jude!"}
{"text":"When I lived closer to the East Coast, I used to eat at Waffle House's often. It was the Atmosphere , food & price that drawed me. That loud diner feel. Orders being yelled out, the small busy kitchen of employees running around without walking into each other, & the hashbrowns \"covered & smothered\". Been living out here in AZ over 13 years now. They have Waffle Houses out here.  But up until this morning, I had never been impressed. This one here is about as close as they come to the ones back home. Lauren was a great waitress. I think the prices are just a little high. But definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in through the moment we left, the service was great! Chela is excellent at keeping everyone organized and she routinely gives her staff positive feedback. Denajah, our waitress, was quick, attentive and friendly. The food was good as always. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I had scrambled eggs with cheese. I had hash browns with mushrooms. Take note that that there were hardly ANY mushrooms. I had white toast with butter and some mixed berry jelly. And a glass of water with lemon. Not bad. But I could have made it myself better. My waitress, Daniella was very high spirited. I liked her customer service. I also liked the welcome from the staff as I walked in."}
{"text":"Went to this location for breakfast sat down and when it was time to order my husband had requested to try the grits to see if they were cooked properly and soft, the waitress brought a sample and they were very grainy and hard.  He nicely asked if they would make a softer batch as he has a broken jaw and she told him they make only the batch for the day and can't make any fresh.   Turns out that was a lie as we went to another location and they instantly made them fresh just the way he requested."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a decent breakfast this is not the place.  I could make the same food at home.  I ordered the cheesy hash browns. They just took a square of fake cheese and lapped it on the middle of the hash browns.  The waffle was mushy and thin.     I remember the Waffle House growing up as a good place....not so much any more!"}
{"text":"Not liking Waffle House is Un-American. This location has super friendly staff and great food. Overall Waffle House is one of my top 3 favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING and the service was fast.  But the people here were the best part. They were friendly, considerate and made us feel welcome the whole time."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff. Hash browns were tasty and kids loved the waffles.   Diner styled atmosphere. Safe area.   Waitress gave us a free waffle which was nice. Coffee was good.   Very satisfied for what it is."}
{"text":"We walked in and put our name in for two. The wait was about 20-30 minutes. We sat down to wait and the host sat four other parties who got there after us. When I asked her nicely about it she didn't know what to say. I told her we were going to leave she rudely said ok bye. This was our first experience and will be our last. I can understand that the place was busy and there may have been a miscommunication but there is no excuse for being rude!"}
{"text":"I know, I am giving a chain breakfast place a 4. But you know, it was good. Imagine a sit down place that might as well be fast food. The kitchen setup is roughly the same with a well oiled machine of an assembly line working. The menu looks a bit like Denny's but with less choices. The prices are a bit more than you would expect to spend at a place like this, but the food amount is worth it.   The waitresses go to the tables, take the order, go back behind the counter and call out the order. And it has to be done a certain way too. There is a lead and three other people cooking, each with their specific job. The lead is handling the bread and the waffle irons. The others deal with the potatoes, eggs, and meats. The basic meal is eggs, potatoes, bacon or sausage and toast. You can substitute grits for the potatoes. We ordered \"1 scrambled, grits, bacon over cooked, wheat and 1 scrambled, potatoes scattered, bacon, sourdough.\" And proceeded to watch the production continue. It was fun to see the whole thing and how quickly our food came out. No written orders were kept in front of the cooks, it was all by memory. There were a few people learning different rolls and funny to see them picking up all the nuances of the waffle house machine.   The food was good. A bit greasy, but lots of food and fast. Its good if you just want to get some average breakfast food and get on your way to something else."}
{"text":"5 stars for excellent service!!  Tonight my best friend, cousin, and I decided to dine in after a night of drinking and before going home, and because I had to use the bathroom.   The bathroom wasn't the greatest but what can you expect from a fast food establishment. It was better than a port o potty and it did the job.   The food and service, however, was on point!   Our server, whom I did not get to catch her name was very attentive as well as friendly. Our cook, Madea went above and beyond. Honestly looking forward to going back when Madea is cooking. Not only did she cook our food really well but she felt as if she had to redeem herself because one of the eggs was slightly cracked when asked for over medium. Something was wrong with the grill or something so she wanted us to know she knew how to make the eggs, we didn't mind although but she felt we deserved the best and what we asked for. It took three attempts to perfect the eggs without breaking and she gave them to us each time she made them. Such an excellent example of customer service and a great cook - someone who prides themselves with cooking. Excellent, excellent staff, service, and food! I ordered bacon and she asked if I wanted 'black people bacon' or 'white people bacon', lemme tell you, the 'black people bacon' was fire! Extra crispy!!"}
{"text":"I love the food. Allstar special is excellence. The people are nice and they know my name. When I am back in town i always visit. Also it is open 24 hours. It is a great place to get food at night or in the morning."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying, I will never hold Waffle House to a very high expectation simply because it's Waffle House. That isn't to say that they don't have some pretty tasty things on the menu, though.  Every Waffle House I've ever been to just seems dirty to me. I don't know if it's because I can see all of the waffle presses and all of the ingredients or maybe it's because I can see them cooking my food? I don't know.   My sister, my boyfriend and I wanted to get some grub before we hit a late showing of Insidious Chapter  2 last night and it just so happens that Waffle House is located just across Baseline Road from AZ Mills Mall.   Their menu is a little overwhelming to me, but then again there are quite a few options for everyone's taste, which I can respect. So eventually we make our decision and I get my hot chocolate and everything is fine minus the lipstick on my mug. Then I get my food.  So. My food was okay. Except for one thing that bothered me. I ordered the Smothered Hashbrowns which just means that they hashbrowns are supposed to be covered in cheese. Um. No. They were a normal serving of hasbrowns with a piece of American Cheese just melted right on top. It still held the perfect square shape of the cheese. Whatever. I still ate it.   The service was decent. She was quick to take our order and quick to bring us our food. She didn't really speak to us other than that and she seemed to be a little irritated that it was taking some time for us to make our decisions.   One more thing.. WHY IS THE CASH REGISTER IN A BOOTH? You either lean over the table to pay or crawl into the booth, I guess!  But! As I previously stated, Waffle House is Waffle House and I can't hold the standards too high against them."}
{"text":"Good food on the cheap is awesome. Better yet when you can sit at the bar and watch the food being made.  No, Waffle House isn't exquisite fine dining. C'mon now.  I guess it's the fact that WH doesn't exist on the West Coast is what makes it taste SO good.  I love Waffle House. Its pretty much the only reason why I'd leave CA."}
{"text":"Being from California, this was my mom and uncle's first time at a WH. I was a little nervous about my mom liking WH 'cause she's a little more health conscious than I am when it comes to eating, and I've played up WH since the first time I had me some in 2009.   I've yet to dine at a WH that I didn't like, this location isn't an exception. Everything was great and went well. My mom liked what she ordered and the service was good; Richard was patient and made reasonable accommodations to our party of five."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE WAFFLE HOUSE!   Anyplace I can pick what I want to eat off of a \"picture menu\"... you got me hooked! :)  I love the loaded hash browns, and waffles. Nothing more, nothing else. They usually can't screw that up... so its generally consistent.... and cheap! A plus is the really good coffee.   So... get yur briches on, put yur teeth in... and come on down to da Waffle Houze!"}
{"text":"This can be one of the dirtiest restaurants in the world however the food is good, waffles are amazing and the service here always make you smile! Simple people that give you five star service and make sure you are properly taken care of!"}
{"text":"One of the very few things that I miss about North Carolina. The Waffle House is a great little spot for after the club, after drinks, or if your hotel's breakfast completely sucks. I had the grilled chicken, eggs, & potatoes. Def hit the spot. This location is one of the cleanest Waffle Houses in the area. The staff are definitely THE most attractive in comparison to most Waffle House employees. I recommend a quick visit."}
{"text":"There is no better omelette than the fiesta (minus the ham).  It has so much creamy egg goodness, spice, and delicious tangy flavor.  I also got the famous hashbrowns with mushrooms on top.  Fast friendly service, and seriously affordable prices.  Nothing beats the waffle house for custom omelettes, hashbrowns, flavor and low price.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I love this location! i mean its ghetto and ive seen a lot of crazy things happen here lol. But they're customer service is awesome, the food is awesome of course! its always nice and warm when it comes out, the staff nice and friendly and its just feels kind of homey here :)"}
{"text":"This is actually the first time I have ever been to a Waffle House. My husband's cousin talks about going here all the time, so I had to check it out.  Our server was friendly and she even was able to incorporate the phrase \" sausage fest \" into our brief conversations. In other instances this would have annoyed me because of how inappropriate it was in this setting, but while staring at her huge pregnant belly, I could do nothing but laugh.  The food was not good. The sausage gravy was way too salty, eggs were way under-cooked, waffles were average, coffee was alright ( served in a lipstick stained mug the first go around ), sausage and bacon were below average, hash browns were limp, mushy, and flavorless.  I would only return to a Waffle House if this was my ONLY option."}
{"text":"The food is usually good but the cleanliness of THIS location is in question.  Not sure how they keep getting an \"A\" on their sanitation score."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Staff was incredibly friendly, our coffee was never less than half gone before it was instantly refilled, the food was a caloric festival of the stomach, the clientele made people watching amazing. Omg. We went two mornings in a row. The biscuits are divine. I had the Texas Toast something and my boyfriend the melt something. It was beyond words. We walked in and were greeted by no less than five people. It was clearly a hot spot for the locals, and I watched the staff be extremely accommodating with an older disabled couple that nearly made me cry. Amazing music selection due to the jukebox, so be sure to bring your quarters!!!"}
{"text":"It was awesome !!!! Fast and very yummy! I don't have Waffle House in Las Vegas . So when I come to Arizona it's nice to get my quick fix. My server was super nice and very helpful."}
{"text":"I decided to get breakfast here today since it's next to my work.  The All-Star special is reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.  Add coffee and you're good.  The food overall needed some seasoning, but a little salt and pepper fixed it for the most part.  The eggs had a little bit of a weird flavor and the waffle was far from being crisp, but overall, I'd get it again for the price.  The bacon was the best part if you're into crisp bacon and the food comes out quick.  Service was a little weird with the seat yourself setting.  I might be back next time I'm looking for a bigger breakfast."}
{"text":"Definitely the nicest Waffle House I have ever been to. Really friendly service and delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"Can't lie... I don't like it. It's always dirty in there no matter the location of the Waffle House. The food is alright. And everyone looks like ex con that works there"}
{"text":"Most amazing waffle house in the world I have been going to him for 20 years plus my entire family has been going here for ever staff is amazing customer service outstanding food is always great mama Jude is the best love her ., and Mary is amazing can't get enough of this place"}
{"text":"Pretty decent. I'm used to a Huddle House where the menu is more expansive. Not a waffle person,but you can't go wrong with the hashbrowns. Service was good, even thought they were packed for Sunday Brunch time.   One major suggestion, well two. Add omlettes go the menu and remodel. It feels like I'm back in the 50s, haha."}
{"text":"Busy Saturday morning, but staff waiting at door to quickly seat guests. Waitress didn't know my table was hers, but apologized and gave me coffee on the house. Food was great overall and appealing."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a whim for waffles. Have been going back because the food is good, the prices are cheap, and the staff is amazing. I am astonished how they accomplish so much without making mistakes. I am sure they make them, I just have never had it happen to me. I cannot remember the names except for Cindy- she is funny and works her tail off to make sure you are happy and everything is good- ( so do all the others). I was hesitant to go because it is just another greasy spoon place, but the atmosphere is worth it, breakfast with conversation."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices.  Sadly, no real butter.  They do have half and half for coffee.  Grits are superior and Texas egg bacon cheese melt is a lip smacker.  Atmosphere reminds me of the good 'ol days.  Fun place.  Servers are exceptional."}
{"text":"I drove from Buffalo NY for Waffles... Waffle House Waffles.  I was back in early summer 2016, I chose this location based on Yelp reviews and being a newer location, I'd been in an older one in N.Carolina, Loved it too.  The staff was nice and friendly, the food Awesome we did the eat in breakfast at 8 30 pm, eggs meat toast and WAFFLES with pecans.  Everything was great, so great we got  an extra round and triple waffles to go... Return trips are planed."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since it's close to home and I can't say I've ever been disappointed. Staff has always been friendly and my kids just love the all you can eat option. It is a Waffle House so mediocre food but you can't expect too much from a Waffle House anyway. I've been to another Waffle House and found a bug on my menu so that was quite a turn off but so far this one seems fairly clean. Good for a quick meal but would head elsewhere if you're looking for great."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and my wife's first time too. She's pregnant and she loved the waffles and hashbrowns. I got the jalapeño hashbrown and that was great too! Very nice ma and pa style restaurant. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Closed due too freeway expansion. The 59th Ave & McDowell next to circle K is open.  We will miss this location!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about the Waffle House from my husband who was formerly a truck driver, and my friends from the south.  That's it.  No one else raves about it because it's not good.  No offense to my friends with all the melanin, I'm sure if I actually liked waffles or pancakes, I might enjoy this place.  But the idea of liquified sugar on an empty stomach makes me want to gag.  Actually syrup at any time of the day is gross.  And the rest of the food is bland.  Blander than Denny's and way worse than IHOP.  You would think that eggs and hash browns wouldn't be so hard to make, but I've never tasted anything with so little flavor.  That must be why they offer it smothered, covered, etc. because the actual vehicle/food has so little taste that it actually sucks the ability of tasting anything out of your tastebuds.  There are so many decent breakfast joints around, I have no idea why anyone would purposely go here.  Except for the fact that it's in front of the Red Owl and you might be able to go here after you drank way too much and wouldn't know the difference anyways."}
{"text":"Food is great and it comes out fast.  I usually end up at the waffle house at night so I can't comment on the day shift.  It's one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite late at night."}
{"text":"I make appearances all over the county and when I am in a city with a WH I GO!!  this WH has been there forever I lived in Tempe 37 years ago and I think it was there then , I love the hash browns, smoothed , covered and chunked !!!! The best ! Just down home fun food"}
{"text":"Ive been to many Waffle Houses and always had decent service at best, so decent at best service is expected. This visit this morning to this location was terrible. Waited 10 minutes for one of the 8 employees behind the counter to address my drink order. 7 minutes later finally a diet coke shows up. Numerous other customers looked not pleased with the terrible service as well. All tables were filthy. Floor was covered with trash and food scraps like a third world. Patty melt came out burnt.  Watched my server coughing in her hands, picked a straw and soggy wet napkin off the nasty dirty floor with her hands and then not wash them. She continued to fold place settings and give her tables refills. I asked for a different server. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Good food for the price, and one of the better places that is available late night. This location is in need of serious cleaning. Which is the ONLY reason why I'm giving  3 stars and not 5. The best food and great service doesn't make up for filth when it is dead in the middle of the night / early morning and there are employees standing around."}
{"text":"I mean who doesn't love Waffle House this one is pretty consistent in terms of quality it's everything you want from a Waffle House"}
{"text":"Sunday...a little after 11am. Met a friend there, it's my first time eating in a Waffle House.   First thing I notice..it's cold as heck in this place. I guess it's to get people moving, eat and get out huh? Didn't want a counter seat, waited less than 5 minutes for a booth. Waitress, Tammy I think..VERY nice. Coffee, then took our orders. I ordered..Omelet cheddar and chives..no cheddar, no chives..american only on hand. Grits, wanted rye toast, got white toast. Wanted link sausages, nope..round patties. Biscuits and gravy...YES!!  Took a while for our order to come..a long while but that's okay. It's a Sunday and we ARE in the South..lazy Sunday Breakfast are good. Food came, it was cold. Duh?! With the ac on ARCTIC, what would one expect. I had no problem with my food being cold though. I dug in. NEVER seen an omelet in that...made like that before. Looked like it was thrown in a microwave and...POOF! Still good though. I wondered 3/4's through my food where was my Biscuits and gravy, had to ask the waitress...she bought it out and it was steaming!! Man, I wish I was a slow eater, I could have thrown it all on top of my eggs and grits and...  Overall, my experience was great. I guess I have to come back on a not so busy day and really taste when the food is brought to the table hot. If I owned a car, I would make this place my 'to go order' spot."}
{"text":"The waffles here are pretty good! Not too sweet, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Our waitress was very friendly and kept checking on us to make sure we were doing ok. If I lived nearby, I'd definitely frequent this place after a night out."}
{"text":"The staff was incredible.  I was looking for a quiet spot off the I-10 to meet someone who lives on the other side of Phoenix, so I chose Waffle House thinking it would fit that bill.  However, when I walked inside, the place was buzzing and the staff was completely slammed. They were bright, friendly and efficient. It was noticeable to more than just myself as I watched another patron ask to speak to the manager so she could compliment the service.  I was not in a hurry and told them that, so please take their time with my order. Despite that, my food arrived so quickly after I ordered that I barely had time to sip my coffee.  Great and unexpected experience!"}
{"text":"So this is not the first time we came in to eat. Late at night their really nothing else that is open so we don't have much of choice. Every time we come in the service sucks. The staff all look like they are on some Kinda drug. I would seriously drug test every single person who works here. One of the older lady looks like she is about to expire any second. If you want decent service. The day crew is why they even have 3 stars. If you want the full waffle House experience come on down to this location. You will get it. I don't think anyone here know what customer service means."}
{"text":"I have NEVER had a good experience here and I know it's a diner! But I still think it's unacceptable. My food has NEVER been cooked how I liked. Plenty of times undercooked. Also their service is horrible! They leave most of their tables dirty so they don't have to deal with customers which is crazy to me, because we're essentially how they get money. Also, you will wait AND for a long time. I have given them multiple chances since they're down the street from my friend's house but I am officially done. Beware! I live Waffle House and now we drive to Concord! RIDICULOUS !!!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped by this place on our way to New Mexico. Their service was quick even though they were super busy.  Their breakfast is amazing and prices are also reasonable... Family of eight; including my parents, my son and siblings w/their significant others our bill total about $80."}
{"text":"Its a Waffle House.  We don't have one in California and I haven't had any in years.  My only experience with this place will be a one and done kind of story, so I can't speak to what other yelpers are speaking of with the service and cleanliness.  While our waitress did get our order wrong, we were pleased to be the only patrons in the establishment at 4pm on a Thursday.  Ignorance is bliss and I will take that along with the new cellulite cells forming on my thighs."}
{"text":"We ate here before midnight because it's the only place open. Ordered a waffle and a plate with hash browns topped with sausage, and scrambled eggs. The service was good but the food was just ok."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Waffle House, and it didn't disappoint. In fact, it far exceeded my expectations. The food was good and plentiful and a good value. The service was fantastic. Our waiter, Kelly, was very helpful, funny, and made us feel right at home. A great experience all around."}
{"text":"July 2017  Bad service and filthy - see pics    2016  Waffle House  Pretty standard where ever you eat at one.  Service at this one is also descent.  Waffle House seems to keep raising their prices every 3-6 months.  They are becoming a little expensive for breakfast compare to their competition like IHOP and Denny's."}
{"text":"Ok, yes..... I am a WH fan!  Bacon egg and cheese on texas toast with a side of hash browns.  Great breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love Waffle House.  Not all locations are the same quality.  This is a good one."}
{"text":"Well there ok but I love the meal with the eggs pancakes toast and hash browns yummy you should try it it's very cheep and my meal for 5 people only came to $12.35 cheep and so awesome"}
{"text":"I love their omelettes and hashbrowns! Also, I love how everyone always yells out, \"Hello\" whenever you walk in!!"}
{"text":"Greasy but good. This place is a sinful treat and I love that hashbrowns are served with everything! Service was prompt and the restaurant was clean. No chicken-fried steak?"}
{"text":"Tiny small place we came to this morning for breakfast. It has the local diner feel and food was average with nothing special nor bad about it. Service was average, and our server was very kind, smiling sincerely and friendly. Our waffles were delayed and we had to remind her about it after our meals, and she mentioned that 2 of the waffle makers were. Token, therefore it was taking time to prepare. Myself and one of my cousins ordered the all star special, and my other cousin ordered steak & eggs. Food was tasty and came out in a timely matter (except for the waffles scenarios mentioned earlier).  Will definitely come back here for another quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Been here twice while on different vacations.  Staff is attentive, food is good and if you sit at the counter, its fun to watch everyone work behind the counter.  If you have kids with you, have your kids ask for a paper hat, they'll love it."}
{"text":"As always the food is what you come here for. Not so much the service. The place was clean but the staff was very rude. Didn't say hello to us for quite sometime we just waited there. They then said \"just sit wherever\" so we took a seat to wait for maybe 10 mins just to get a drink. The staff then proceeded to fight with eachother while we waited. The food was good as usual. But they forgot 2 things we ordered. I could understand if maybe it was busy although even then fighting with eachother and being rude isn't the way to go. With this said on our birthdays we have waffle house and we will forever continue to do so."}
{"text":"Anyone that hasnt been to a Waffle House before may find this kind of place a little different for them. But its a good different!  Its a tiny little building that is always crowded on the weekends. The food....its your basic diner fare, except that its awesome! You dont get the typical greasy egg and hashbrowns here, no sir! They do it like you would do at home. Just good, fresh, made-right food at impeccable prices. The staff is ALWAYS friendly even if they may seem a little too personable to you sensitive types who believe that all servers should treat you like they are your butler. Personally, I love the friendly personal chatty atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Server argued with customers although she was in the wrong.  Extremely rude to others and we decided to leave because we didn't trust the food at that point."}
{"text":"Happy! The people who work here are super-friendly, attentive, and cook your food to order and it comes out FAST. Meals are inexpensive and I had NO issue with grease, and I ordered my hashbrowns with \"the works\" which included sauteed veggies and chili. The chili had a lot of meat in it, too, pretty awesome! I also had an order of biscuits and gravy and I was super-happy with that, as the biscuits were soft and chewy with just a few crunchy edges. The gravy may be a little salty for some but for me it was perfect! Even had some mystery chunks in there (sausage?) that gave the dish depth. I enjoyed it and I will be back!"}
{"text":"It looks like the workers really don't care and clean well enough.... I was sitting by the window with my girlfriend and I swear 3 flys kept swarming around us and our food. Really ruined my appetite but the waffles are good ."}
{"text":"Waffle House serves the classic Americana breakfast... Top value, great quality on all the breakfast basics... And with the dyed in the wool Waffle House crew attitude, this chain does it right. It's Disneyland for breakfast lovers... delicious and campy.  This location gets five stars, not just for doing everything Waffle House to the T... but this is the closest location to us 40 million Californians.   Can I open a francise in Cali? I'd bet the farm on it being a hit. With a Waffle House on Hollywood Blvd., I'd retire like Warren Buffett, or at least like Jimmy."}
{"text":"Grew up in the south where Waffle House is a staple.  It's grits hash and eggs.  This morning I had extra crispy hash browns with jalapeños, ham, onions and cheese.  Perfect hash brown fix.  Thank you Waffle House for having consistent food for at least the last 40 years.  Because that's how long I have eaten at one.  Damn I am getting old but at least Waffle House is still the same.  An American Tradition."}
{"text":"Feel like like a celebrity when you eat here!  Well, not really, but it's a great place to \"people watch\".  The food is pretty good, and the staff is friendly. I eat there a couple times a week. Free coffee on Sundays for those who wait for a table."}
{"text":"I walked in to a chorus of \"Welcome to Waffle House\" by a group of enthusiastic servers.They were motivated from the time we entered until the time we left.  Our server made sure we didn't have to wait for anything we needed.  She was very prompt and nice.  They had a sanitation grade of 97.  It looked and smelled clean.  What was most comforting was the fact that you are able to watch your food being prepared.  The floor in the food preparation area looked clean as well.    The food was just regular breakfast food but it was served exactly the way we ordered it.  They do have a few new things on the menu that I may try on my next visit!  Good job, Waffle House."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good I've seen a fight break out amongst the staff before they also don't like to answer the phone all the time but the food is good lol"}
{"text":"I loved the hospitality! The food was good and the wait wasn't as bad as most. I wish we were seated faster but it is understood on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"If im eating here it's 2 am and i've been drinking. nothing taste better than waffle house at 2 am. The take such amazing care of us no matter how \"happy\" we maybe.  no matter the group size the always got us. I've never eaten here during the day. That waffle and those hash browns yes!"}
{"text":"Want to try some delicious, buttery, fluffy waffles? You've come to the right place. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their waffles here. I have not had a waffle as delicious as here. I have tried Denny's, IHOP, and Black Bear. None as delicious as Waffle House. Come on, the name says it ALL!! Not only do their waffles blow me away, but the HASHBROWNS are freakin good. You can order them like 5 different ways. Smothered, spicy and all kinds of delicious ways.   Not a big fan of their coffee (I like mine a bit stronger) but their options, service and waffles keep me coming back. I also appreciate the friendly service every time I come too. :-) Thank you to all those hardworking cooks, servers, and cleaning crew that make this establishment great!"}
{"text":"Quick service with a smile! Early on Sunday morning there was someone at the door to greet me and open the door for me. Plenty of good cheer once I was seated as well. Service was prompt and courteous. Eggs, bacon, and sausage were cooked perfectly.  My glass was never empty and we had great conversation. Easily walkable from the multiple hotels on this street."}
{"text":"If you like greasy truck stop-esque food (like me) you'll LOVE The Waffle House.  And I can not recommend the Hash Browns enough! Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the best drunk food drunk money can buy. Very self explanatory, if not just order a greasy burger and enjoy. Never has any issues with this place at all, always friendly and correct. :)"}
{"text":"I LOVES me some Waffle House (the best hashbrowns in town IMHO) but this location is not their best."}
{"text":"Trying the All Star Special with a blueberry waffle, eggs over easy, raisin toast and grits. Details to follow.  Alright, didn't catch the details on the menu but it cost $.50 extra for the blueberries.   I don't think it was worth it because they seemed fake.  Service was prompt and efficient. Food was decent and a welcome change from routine. The grits were delicious, my eggs cooked to order.  I asked for the ham steak and it was alright.  I liked the apple butter served along with the toast but I'm more of a grape jelly fan and darn it we weren't even given a selection to choose from. The waffle is probably something that should've been consumed first because it got cold and the side touching the plate lost that crispy exterior that I like.   It was, um, okay I guess.  I ate a quarter of the waffle and then told my son he could have the rest if he wanted.   Next time I'll pass on the blueberries and try to eat a bit of it immediately after it arrives at the table so I can determine if it's actually good or not."}
{"text":"Stopped here at 3am after a fun evening, had the bowl with grits, eggs and sausage, so good after a night of cocktails excellent service!"}
{"text":"We were here in AZ for a conference, needed a place that was open late to have dinner and came across this place. We are for a week and have already been to the Waffle House 3 times. All young people working, but they were all great and friendly. We went once during the day and I think there was a newer person on the waffle station (our waffles were burnt and it was flipped over so we couldn't tell until we turned the waffle over---otherwise it woulda been a 5 star rating). We ordered waffles each time and hash brown bowls and breakfast plates. Everything was awesome and at reasonable prices. Would definitely recommend for breakfast or late night dinner/munchies."}
{"text":"Waffle House I love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach, when feeling out of sight for the ends of being ideal and grace. I love thee to the level of every days most quiet need, by sun and candle light, I love thee freely, as most Waffle House lovers strive for. I love thee so purely, I just love thee...  My love and admiration for the Waffle House is evident... But seriously what's not to love? You tell me of another place where I can get a delicious buttery waffle, two eggs, bacon (or meat of your choosing!), toast, and some seriously epic hash browns with all the fixins' for under 8.00? Yep me neither. But all jokes aside the Waffle House serves up a killer breakfast with no pretentious fluff just good ol' American greatness. Service is adequate, people watching is as good as it gets and you will go home full, happy and entertained without emptying your wallet!    Whatcha waiting for?"}
{"text":"Was not really impresses with the food, mediocre at best. Went because of the 4 star review. Not sure why it got that."}
{"text":"this particular Waffle House is great! super clean! food was perfect.. my waiter demarea was great along with the rest of the staff who greeted everyone with a smile as they came through the door. the energy here is amazing.... would deff stop by again when in town.."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a waffle house in years but my cousin wanted to go. All I could remember is they had the best grits. When we walked in we were greeted right away. I didn't know what to get so i got the basic breakfast it's a great bargain for the amount of food I got. Everything was good  and served hot. Everyone who worked there was in a great mood and super friendly."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Waffle House in town. The biscuits and gravy tasted like cardboard and salt. The waffles with chocolate chip tasted and smelled like plastic."}
{"text":"This place has the most special ed employees ever!! I call them ever morning because it's my favorite breakfast place in Tempe. Every morning I order the sameeeeee thing. Every morning they get it wrong...!! I ask them to repeat the order back to me and they stillllll get it wrong!! Like how stupid can you truly be? Apparently super stupid because I tell these dumb broads I'm allergic to mushrooms and chili and guess what they put on my food both mushrooms and chili... Now if I wasn't paying attention to my food every morning and just eaten it, and gotten sick I would sue the brakes off their ass which is something I should've just done... The most super low level females in there no commonsense, no education, ridiculous..."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Waffle House so I wanted to give it a try... I enter the restaurant and took a seat at the counter it all booths were full... I was greeted by a friendly staff and I looked over the menu and saw the managers special posted on the wall and had to try it. Eric's Southwest Sausage burger with Hash browns (Contains ground beef, pork onions and jalapenos)... I rate the food as followed.  Eric's Southwest Sausage burger - C Hash Browns - C  I could have made this meal myself at home... I was pretty disappointed but I did see other things I want to try so I may be back... Friendly staff keeps people coming back."}
{"text":"Not sure why some reviews classify the location as \"ghetto\". It's basically in a truck stop, obviously not the swankiest neighborhood but nothing too sketchy. Simply put: you get what you pay for. The food, service and decor are not the best in the biz, but it's very affordable. Who's complaining?  Not me!"}
{"text":"Wanted to goto a Waffle House since we dont have any around us in california.  We chose this one because it was in North Phoenix and hoping it was a little nicer then some of the others we drove by. It didnt matter, i guess a waffle house is a waffle house. They had some teenager cooking the food and we where wondering how the food was going to come out, well the bacon was black and burnt, atleast the waitress asked us before we said anything about it. So she got us some more bacon and this time it was just under cooked. The egg's were not cooked all the way. The waffles where good and the hash browns where good if you didnt eat the burnt parts. Might try it again but maybe a different location"}
{"text":"Chandler Boulevard Waffle House employees smoking ?? in front of the store...! I'm a regular at my neighborhood Waffle House, so I am used to walking through clouds of cigarette smoke to get to the front door, the rowdy after hours crowds, the waitresses screaming orders at the cooks, it's all part of the charm. But the Chandler Boulevard store is out of control. We arrived at about 10:30 PM, April 14, after attending the nearby races. We walked up on two uniformed male employees smoking within about 10 feet of the entrance. It was obvious they weren't smoking cigarettes. I said sarcastically \"gee what's that smell\". One of them handed the ?? back to the other and quickly turned and headed into the store exhaling slowly as he was leaving, trying not to be too obvious. The other one loudly proclaimed \"it's medicine I've got a card\". I replied \"really waffle house lets you medicate at work and you can share your medicine with your buddy? Upon entering the store we noticed about 15 rowdy high school kids bouncing off the walls, with no employees actually working. The place was a disaster, all the tables were full of dirty dishes. We turned and left and went to Cracker Barrel across the parking lot. Had a nice late night breakfast. I am a big fan of Waffle House but what happened here? Where is management?"}
{"text":"The service was okay but the cleanliness could use improvement. Some of the syrup bottles had been leaking for awhile and built a nasty sticky crust on the outside of the bottles. The exterior of the restaurant looked great, customer service could use some improvements with a smile! Although none of the staff were rude, they also did not appear to be having a good day and partially projected that towards the customers. I would definitely go back to this location with the hopes of providing a higher star rating."}
{"text":"First the orange juice was very salty and the water was murky. The waffle machine had not been clean in weeks. The cooks did not have gloves on which is very unsanitary!!! The worked were sitting and talk and they did not even care to help or ask if we needed anything!!! They could have been cleaning or whateva!!! The waffles tasted like hotel food with best western quality. The entire Waffle House vibe is kinda bad. I can't all that air conditioning it is colder in there than the North Pole and that is saying something. Can we just go back to the health concern for those people. The had had some really good place mats tho really nice to eat on."}
{"text":"This is the second time that we had breakfast at the Waffle House in Goodyear. Both times we really enjoyed out meal. The staff is friendly and attentive to our needs. It is fun to sit at the counter and watch everyone interact."}
{"text":"This Waffle House is by far the worst of the chain I have eaten in. The waitress did not pay attention when I ordered, so my Fiesta Omelet did not have any tomatoes. The jalapeños where caps with stems attached. I ordered fiesta omelet with grits, no toast. She brought me the omelet with nothing else. So the omelet was taken back to get the grits and when I got it back, it was already cooling. The omelet only had about half of the ingredients I have had at all other Waffle House restaurants. P Poor."}
{"text":"Wow they have the music up so loud we could not even talk to each other. The waitress did not call the order the way we gave the order to them. If they don't call it right the cook can't cook it right. Other than that it's a Waffle House ."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and amazing people working here. Not to mention the great people who love our waffles. But First time at a waffle house and it is just what I imagined."}
{"text":"When reviewing Waffle Houses you tend to seperate them according to service and cleanliness of restaurants; mainly due to the fact it's hard to screw up Waffle House food.  Now down to the review. This Waffle House has very friendly service. Several tables needed to be cleaned once my family and I arrived but they were promptly cleaned shortly after our arrival. The food came out fairly quick and the servers were super friendly to my family and the other patrons that arrived after us. My only problem was this Waffle House floors were fairly dirty and it seemed like the waitress waited for a few tables to pile up with leftovers before actually cleaning them. Other than it's cleanliness, It is a good Waffle House in Columbus to go to."}
{"text":"We came here after spending some time at the strip club next door. This place has awesome breakfast food and really cool staff. Their sausage patties were not greasy and their waffles were delicious. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd definitely go back..but I can't say the same for the strip joint next door.   Uber!"}
{"text":"How can you not like the Waffle House?  Just knocked back the pecan waffle loaded with butter and syrup. Oh and a side of sausage. You know the food is good when the kids are quiet.  Place is far from fancy, but never disappoints."}
{"text":"Totally unexpected, but the overnight shift at this Waffle House were the nicest people. It's a Waffle House so the food is what it is, but the people were genuinely polite and friendly -- not expected."}
{"text":"All food here should be served with a side of pepto and some TP.  Fist off no tables for 5 or more people so our group of 5 was split.  5 orders 1 right and the other 4 were never corrected only a casual sorry was offered.  I had the classic 2 eggs grits and sausage.  The grits were cold, lumpy and watery.  As a true southerner I knew them for what they were right away.  They had been setting for a long time and someone tried to add some water but they added cold water and did not stir it in. I spent the rest of the night in the bathroom so enough said."}
{"text":"The food is the same as every other Waffle House but the late night service leaves a lot to be desired. There was one point where the staff was loudly cursing at each other, including the supervisor, whom we asked to speak too. There are so many other places to get hash browns in the middle of the night, IHOP and Denny's both have better behaved staff"}
{"text":"Service here is great. They're very kind and fast but will let you sit and enjoy yourself. It's a good location. Can't go wrong with cheap breakfast!"}
{"text":"When you tell me you've got the original sweet cream waffle, well- I expect you to beat every other waffle place I've been. Unfortunately, the Waffle House didn't deliver on that. But, the food wasn't horrible. I'd give their waffles a step up from Denny's & IHOP.   And maybe it was the fact that we were at one of their smaller chain restaurants, but the seating capacity was so very limited. The booths only sit 2 people and parties larger than that have to sit at the counter (and even then the counter only seats about 4).   Other than that, our server Linda was super sweet and very attentive. She was older which may have added to her kind demeanor. Her name tag says she's been working here for 16 years! No wonder people come back :-)  All in all, not a bad place to grab a quick bite to eat. Plus the cook came and offered us DVD's that he sells on the side  hilarity!"}
{"text":"I mean it is the Waffle House. You kinda know what you are going to get. The food isn't anything to rave about, but the service is usually hit or miss. Everything here is usually better after a night of drinking!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast and Service I've had in awhile. Tina our server was very very very polite best service hands down.......5 stars for me....."}
{"text":"Waffle House is the Ultimate Hangover Helper.  So picture this: It's your annual company Christmas party.  You knock back three too many glasses of Pinot Noir and not enough jalapeno bacon wrapped shrimp and bruschetta to counter the effects.  Upon waking up, your partner (kind enough to DD / ensure you don't say anything dumb around the Company President or boss, thanks love!) informs you you survived the night with your dignity and class fully intact.  High-fiiiiiiiiiiive!  But, you still wake up exceptionally hungover.   What do you do? You hit up Waffle House for a hangover breakfast to feel better stat, that's what!   I can stumble to the counter wearing Yoga pants and hoodie with my hair a hot mess and no one will judge me (outloud).   At least I hope not. Come on, it's near ASU fah cryin' out loud! Oh, you're judging me? Pound sand, sweetheart.   The place was clean, and the employees were friendly enough.  I can get some coffee, scrambled eggs, semi greasy hash browns and a heaping stack of raisin toast for a great price and feel halfway better by 1PM.   Thanks Waffle House for always solving our hangover crises and drunk munchies needs! I know we'll meet again soon ..."}
{"text":"It's a waffle house so it is as you would expect it to be.  They are very friendly and helpful and the food is always fast, hot and good.  There are a lot of Dallas fans in there and they were even friendly to us as Steelers fans!"}
{"text":"The place was ghetto but the waffles were pretty good.  I ordered a hot chocolate, made with hot water btw, homie is like \"We dont give out Free Refills.\" Who asks for free refills on a hot chocolate.  Lot's of interesting people lurking around. Worth the try but not coming back for a second time."}
{"text":"The hostess told us a 15 minute wait. After about an hour of waiting we finally got seated. Granted it's a Sunday, terrible service all around."}
{"text":"We go to Waffle House occasionally. Waffle House's tend to be behind the times. They just began accepting credit/debit cards 1-2 years ago. They may still be cooking with lard. Kidding. The only thing I ever eat is chicken breast with two eggs and coffee. Kids love the waffles of course.   This place is good for a quick breakfast although there are times when the lines get long and you end up waiting a while to be seated. Rochelle, the hostess, is great -friendly and gets people into seats as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better waffle houses in the area. I had the bacon patty melt, service was fast and staff were friendly! This location is very convenient to my house, which makes it even better. Also this location was cleaner than most which is ALWAYS a plus."}
{"text":"Make sure you say hi to Thomas in the morning. The best cook at this location. Try the green chili's on a sandwich."}
{"text":"Its a good waffle house the only reason i am giving 3 stars is because i was alittle disappointed with the menu chioces."}
{"text":"Like a time warp back to the college days: with coeds crawling over booths, late night boozing til morning, recuperating with Waffle House and one arm around a friend at a 70s style booth.  Slunk over to Waffle House with Faster Pussycat after their Club Red show. Waitresses were friendly enough, a little bit of that coarse \"what can I do ya for\" attitude that we all know and love. Food came out fast, and hot, too! Not a single complaint from anyone.  There's absolutely nothing better than the memories you'll make at 3am with close friends at a Waffle House filled to the gills with happy-go-lucky drunks."}
{"text":"It took my 18 years to make it to Waffle House, but when I finally did, I was hooked.  My personal favorite is the chicken melt, hash browns, chocolate chip waffle, and a glass of sweet tea. One of my high school friends and I go eat, sit, and talk there for hours when I come home from college. The waitresses at this Waffle House are so accommodating and don't bat an eye that we stay so long. They take good care of us and are constantly refilling my tea.. Not to mention, this particular  Waffle House is exceptionally clean and safe. I've spent many late nights at this Waffle House and foresee many in the future."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday morning and the service was excellent. Attentive, friendly, and with a smile.  We got the All Star Entree and add on of pecan and drink for a total of $14.44.  Waffle was oh so fluffy and buttery. Bacon was on point! The butter spread they gave us was so soft and whipped, making? it? easy to apply (I hate hard-stick butter ?for soft bread/waffles?). This is ?also? total drunk-people-food?. It's r?ich in fat, starch, sodium and carb?s?. It's great to enjoy once in a while to fulfill your \"breakfast\" cravings. Maybe those who come in late and DRUNK get terrible service as? some other yelpers have commented. I mean, when is serving drunk people ever nice anyway! Lol.  I would come back when I visit from CA! If you all ever come to Southern CA, come visit Roscoe?'?s Chicken? &? Waffl?es."}

{"text":"I had steak and eggs and egg.  That is my attempt at humor because I ordered an extra egg with my meal.  The steak came out a bit overcooked so they happily turned the first into a dog treat and made me abother.  It is a very low quality piece of meat, and I know what you are thinking, but for $10 I was hoping for something a little nicer.  Regardless my eggs were cooked properly and they gave me plenty of tomato.  The parking lot is a mess, hard to get in and out if it with such a severe bottleneck.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Uhmmmm, yum. This was my 1st waffle house experience & I was not disappointed. We heard the waitress tell the cook to make it extra good since it was our 1st time.   I had a breakfast burrito and asked to have the hash browns inside - the waitress told me in all the years she worked there that was the 1st time anyone had asked for that. I felt special. No, it doesn't take much.   I also tried the banana split waffle. It has blueberry, strawberry, pecans, banana, apple cinnamon, chocolate chip and whipped cream. I was going to get a plain waffle but when the waitress told me that I couldn't resist. I ended up eating the waffle and took 1/2 the burrito home to have for breakfast the next morning. It heated up well! I did ask for crispy bacon in my burrito but ended up taking it out because it wasn't at all crispy and fatty bacon grosses me out.   My friend had biscuits & gravy, said the gravy was a bit to peppery and ended up just eating the biscuit part really. She kinda had a biscuit party for breakfast actually. Had a breakfast biscuit w/ another biscuit. Lets just say her biscuit wants were larger than her biscuit abilities and they didn't all get eaten.   The biscuit wasn't that great to me, a little too dry for my liking but the waffle & breakfast burrito were tasty! So glad I was finally able to try a Waffle House!"}
{"text":"I love Waffle House, I really do. Unfortunately in the 3 times I've come to this location, the waffle has been burnt. Today I got a burnt waffle AND my order was wrong. I ordered a waffle and a covered hash browns (covered means with cheese) and I got a waffle that was so obviously dark and burnt and a hash browns with no cheese. I pointed out the no cheese and the waitress was very nice so I didn't send it back. But then I dug into the waffle, I mean, maybe I was wrong and it just looked dark. They wouldn't give me a waffle that was burnt or not up to Waffle House standards would they? And while the great taste was still there, it was so crisp as to be hard. The syrup had to soften it up a little. I looked around at other people's waffles and they were light in color so I imagine they were soft and fluffy in texture. I pointed this out as I paid and the cashier very nicely offered to not charge me but of course I paid for it...I ate the whole thing and it still tasted good, not just the awesome waffles ice come to expect from Waffle House. I don't send stuff back unless it's just horrible, plus you have to wait a long time for the replacement. I just wish this Waffle House could be consistent. It's always a gamble when I come here and I have to go in knowing this and be okay with it."}
{"text":"Will forever remind me of being on tour, often in the south. There is never any other place open after you load up the gear, pile in the van and finally get on the road. IWaffle House in always there, like an old friend, no matter where you go it's a little consistent, familiar piece of my redneck home. There will always be great George Strait, Bob Seger or Eagles songs on the jukebox... and of course there will always be the wise ass in the group (usually me) that will put in 5 bucks before we leave and secretly play one of the many terrible \"Waffle House\" songs, now forcing the remaining unsuspecting patrons to listen to \"844739 Ways to Eat a Hamburger\" twenty times before they likely unplug the jukebox. Ahhh, Waffle House. You are forever in my heart."}
{"text":"I get the same thing every time: one waffle and the hash browns all-the-way with an over easy egg to top it off. Never fails. So damn delicious"}
{"text":"This is one of the old school Waffle House's; not one of the new clean ones!  Not sure if that's good or bad but who really cares when you're there in the wee hours of the AM?!?!  There's probably not a lot to say here because who's never really been to a WH, right?  If you haven't then your probably visiting from a foreign country...  Any who, the staff here is always friendly and eager to serve.  The ham and cheese omelet is fluffy and cooked just right.  It's pretty impressive to cook one this well because I've had a few that were as tough as a leather bag.  The 'All Star' breakfast is the best deal and guaranteed to add an inch to your waiste or a bad case of late night heartburn.    Best joke I ever heard at a Waffle House in college:  \"What has six boobs and eight teeth?\"  Answer: \"The night shift at the Waffle House!\"  Enjoy!"}

{"text":"The food is awful! Don't waste you're time and money keep on driving. The burgers are frozen patties the hash browns taste like they came out of a bag and the waitress was annoying."}
{"text":"Wife had the craving to eat at Waffle House, it was a semi-busy night, I would've given a 4 star the reason because our server was ghetto, you don't chew gum while taking orders need to pronounce each word & please use an order ticket to take our order not write it on your hand, didn't even wash her hands after she placed the order to the cook.       I give it to them the place/restroom was clean, the food was good just as usual, you can't go wrong wth breakfast at anytime of the day even if it's for dinner..."}
{"text":"100% better then the old one that was here. Much cleaner and the seating is slightly different it has the bar seating across the front counter. I'm a coke connoisseur and usually Waffle House Coke is on point this location however is slightly sweeter the carbonation is off. However most people aren't as picky as I am about that. The food is better the some but very typical of Waffle House. However, the food depends on how well the cook prepares it."}
{"text":"Anytime he utters the words WAFFLE HOUSE I am in... Sunday morning breakfast... Friday night bite...I freakin' LOVE Waffle House! I always get the hashbrowns smothered (onions) covered (cheese) and topped (chili)  Granted its a total dive, older place but who cares... we all love it, kids are always happy and so is momma! We always get great service and our coffee stays full and hot and the ice tea is great!"}
{"text":"We used to frequent this restaurant weekly but after a certain supervisor left it just wasn't the same.  We tried it again today and were pleasantly surprised.  The food was excellent but the snappy bickering is annoying between a couple of employees.  Otherwise a great experience."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch today as something out of the ordinary.  I guess Waffle House is best when you're drunk because today, in the bright sunshine, it was less than I remember in every way.  I ordered the #1, the All American Bacon Cheeseburger with plain hash browns and a coke.  In an effort to find the silver lining, I'll say that my coke was tasty and leave it at that.  I won't make the mistake of coming back unless it's in the wee hours of the night."}
{"text":"Love Waffle House. Best breakfast ever."}
{"text":"If your plan is to shave a few years off your life, then this is the place to be.  The only remotely healthy menu item is a BACON chicken CHEESE salad.  Every other selection is smothered in some artery clogging sauce.    The place is popular for breakfast so be ready to wait.   There are lots of employees, but they still have a hard time keeping up."}
{"text":"We came here after not getting any service at the Waffle House on I-17 & Bell. This one was great! Everyone who worked there was sweet and acted as if they were family. Super quick service and the order was on point! The cook even took the time to ask how everything was. Would definitely come here again-glad we stopped."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and sat there while literally everyone else was helped - phone orders AND walk ins included. Meanwhile we just sat. After 15 minutes, we got up and left. Threw a $5 on the table and left. They were awful!"}
{"text":"I have never been so disgusted in my life I ordered steak and eggs and they brought me a cold piece of grey matter uncooked eggs and on top of all that it was freezing cold in there I could see my breath that place needs shut down for how gross it is too I will contact the health department"}
{"text":"Whenever you review a chain you have to do so on the merits of the already held assumptions of the public- the menu, the prices, the service model. These things are set. What remains are three simple things: the courtesy of the staff, the efficiency of the order process and the quality of the food delivered.   I've eaten at this Waffle House 4-5 times. Each time, the staff had been kind, responsive and warm. The order has always been handled almost instantly. But most importantly, the food comes hot, not lukewarm. As I say, the options, ambiance, food choices and chef skill aren't part of the experience at a chain like this. But for what it is this Waffle House does excellent at giving it's namesake a worthy showing."}
{"text":"First time at a WH, and it was pretty good. Everything is so cheap so I ordered everything, when I could have been satisfied with half of my pecan waffle (which is the amount I ate). I would definitely order the pecan waffle again! I was surprised that you can add a topping such as blueberries, or have blueberries cooked inside your waffle. Fancy! Jk. It was very cold inside, which is probably because windows surround the entire little diner. Nice waitress, clean, and also practically empty at 2am."}
{"text":"Waffle House is Waffle House so no detailed review here.   Only, this was the worst service I had ever gotten at a WH. I watched the room and it seemed to me that I was not the only one getting bad service.   They were not even that busy.   Food was good."}
{"text":"Upon entering at a busy time - the friendly hostess took our name and told us the approximate wait time.  The wait was shorter than told - which is always a plus with kids.  I also liked that they took our order while we waited for a table.  It did make things quicker.  Food was delivered quickly and it was hot of course. When my son needed a milk refill, the gentleman at the register did it since our server was busy.  It is always nice to see people working together and helping each other out.  Our server - April, was friendly and was able to answer our questions.  When my son asked about the baseball style hat - we were told that we could buy one online.  If they had them there - it would have been an additional purchase.  The picture we took is of the manager - Shea - who was constantly working. We really enjoyed our Father's Day & my hubby's birthday meal today."}
{"text":"I love the waffle house for their speedy service,  this one didn't offer such service. The place was empty but pretty muchb all the tables were dirty......had dirty dishes on them. The staff went about their business behind the counter in no rush to clean the tables. I sat there for almost 20 minutes waiting. No one seemed to care. No one asked me if i needed anything or why I was sitting there etc. The floors were pretty dirty too. Food and used napkins strewn about."}
{"text":"I just love this place! Can't beat the All Star breakfast. I don't know what type of batter they use for the waffles but it's great. Every time I visit Charlotte I have to go. The service is fast and the food is cheap and greasy and I love it.  I don't care that all the cooks might be on parole I still love it."}
{"text":"I'm a long time customer of this location... I admired the cleanliness of the location. I visit today and I'm disgusted by the uncleanness of the waffle  irons, the lack of communication, and the overall disgusting service.. I am truly upset!"}
{"text":"If memory serves - and it might not - this is the first Waffle House that I ever visited where they accepted credit cards.  For years, the Waffle House would take cash, and only cash.  No checks, no credit cards, just cash.  That's a business model.  Of course, it's not convenient, but it makes life easier for them.  As to the experience, you may have to wait, depending on when you get there, but because the service is quick, it's usually not a long wait, and it means you just get more time to marvel at the process that is the Waffle House.  These people are simply amazing - the way that the servers yell their orders, and more impressively the way that the cooks keep up with them.  If you pay attention, you'll see that they actually set up plates to indicate the way that eggs are cooked, or what they come with (toast, etc).  But it's still very cool to watch, and you'll typically be in and out in no time.  The food isn't fancy, but it's a good greasy meal for a fair price."}
{"text":"There used to be an older Waffle House location just down the street from this location - and when I say just down the street, I mean just down the street - it was probably not a thousand feet from the new place.  Why did they move?  No idea whatsoever.  There are Waffle Houses all over that look like they should have been torn down decades ago, and quite frankly that old one is probably newer than many of them.  Other than being a bit dingy, there really was nothing wrong with it.  But the new building is definitely nice.  Set back from the road, with a nice parking area rather than about three spots that you have to fight for at any time of day or night?  Sweet.  Though every 'house seems to be on just about the same layout, this one just feels larger.  Perhaps they have an extra stool at the counter or maybe they have yet to build up the additional layer of grease around the edges, so you feel less cramped.  Whatever it is, you get a completely different vibe in this building, and it is all good, baby!"}
{"text":"Usually stop here once a week on my days off for breakfast. Great waffles, great breakfast food. It's your typical diner inside. Not the cleanest, but the food makes up for it. The food comes out really fast. Beats having to wait, sit, order etc at other places. Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just Dirty..   Need to actually wipe the tables, change their gloves, washed her hands. Probably the worst experience in North Carolina I had. Thats all I have to to / need to say."}
{"text":"So, I will say, this place lives up to its name in terms of waffles. They probably have the best waffles I have ever had. However, that's probably the only thing I would care to go here for (oh and the cheap pricing). The eggs were wetter than I would like, the hash browns were greasy and the toast was pretty soggy. The only thing I really liked other than the waffles was the bacon. So I would say if you want really good waffles at a cheap price, come here. Otherwise, I would say your safe to pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"Horrible service and even worse food. I will NEVER go back to this shit hole!  It took over 45 minutes to get in. The server was an idiot. Just horrible."}
{"text":"I go to this Waffle House almost every week, and for the most part it's pretty good. Everyone is nice, the food has never tasted bad, the sweet tea is delicious. The only complaint I really have is there is an employee there who hooks their cell phone up to a Bluetooth speaker and blasts some form of rap music while cooking, sometimes playing the rap music over whatever music is already playing through the jukebox, which is incredibly annoying and adds an unnecessary level of obnoxiousness to my meal. This usually happens at night, though, so if you go during the day, maybe you won't have the same experience. Or, ya know, if you like that kind of thing, go at night!"}
{"text":"No reason to return, not as clean as it use to be. Female manager on duty does nothing but micro manage. Food still good and hot. Cook was busting ass greeted and said thank you when leaving. His momma taught him right."}
{"text":"Stopped to have breakfast this morning. Unfortunately my food was less than ok. Placed my order, another waitress had to come back to ask what I ordered. 2eggs scrambled, hash browns, bacon well done, white toast, coffee and water. Received my bacon and was told the rest was on its way but noticed the plate just sitting there. Then she delivered my food and told me my toast will be up soon. Eggs over done and cold, hash browns cool from sitting. Still no toast. I have never ever received my food cold from Waffle House."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars not for the excellent food or exceptional service but quite the opposite. When I eat at Waffle House I expect greasy spoon food and atmosphere which is truly delivered. Nice waitresses and surly cooks greasy breakfast and hot coffee. If I had something I didn't like I guess it would be the gelatinous butter like substance they serve. I prefer real butter. Other than that all the things that are wrong with this restaurant is what makes it right. My order usually includes hash browns scattered, covered, smothered and chunked."}
{"text":"I live down the street from this WH so my circle of friends often finds ourselves here after a night of debauchery. It's really nothing special, trucker food at it's best, but the staff is really nice and there's something about it that makes my hangovers feel better."}
{"text":"The service here was a notch below other locations and I have eaten at my share of WHs. Food was solid as always, but the bacon had more than the typical grease/crud expected from a WH. Overall, while the location is not the greatest and the server did not offer a cup of coffee to go(happens about 40% of the time) for the price and speed of service; I will take this over McD any day!"}
{"text":"This Waffle House was my first experience at one of its kind. Boy, it was pretty dirty in the kitchen. However, it's understandable due to how busy they are. I have to say, the waffles are delicious! It's one of those hole in the wall comfort food places. The prices are comparable to other breakfast places and I think it's one of the only options for a decent breakfast place in university area."}
{"text":"Delicious, greasy, diner  food in a tiny little open restaurant, yes please!!  It's definitely not the most fancy of places, but what you see is what you get. I love the prices and simple menu. The value meals are huge and worth the price! I got a 2 egg scrambled plate with bacon, raisin toast, grits, and a famous waffle. And it was all around 7 bucks!! I could barely get all of it down but I had to sample everything since California doesn't have these. Waffles were so good, it was the favorite part of meal. I also love raisin cinnamon toast as an option compared to the boring toast most places offer. Coffee is really good here, probably because it is served constantly all day long. They put whipped cream on the hot cocoa as well. :)  Service was okay for a place that is extremely busy. There was people standing around waiting to get seats and a ton of to go orders being made. Since waitresses are literally right next to you it doesn't take long to get refills, condiments, and anything else you might need."}
{"text":"Late night craving for breakfast.  Ordered: scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns and wheat toast. Bacon was on the burnt side as well as the hash browns.  Bf had: waffle, bacon, sausages and hash browns. He really enjoyed the waffle."}
{"text":"They use to have a fail \"F\" and were close to being shut down, but they've redeemed themselves and they are better than ever."}
{"text":"Servers are surly. Jennifer is not friendly at all. Really disappointed in the service.  Hash browns all the way are good. But two eggs are $2.75?! Wow.  Need to update the prices and service."}
{"text":"Server Jackie needs an attitude adjustment. Slow, angry, surly, doesn't smile. Sad. I asked for hash browns extra crispy she just refused to tell the cook to do that. Needless to say, they weren't extra crispy.   Food is inconsistent. Sometimes the all the way hash browns are great, sometimes they're soupy!  Second night in a row Jackie is horrific. Go find something you enjoy doing. Serving is not one of them obv..."}
{"text":"Situated right next to the Sports Connection, an easy and inexpensive way to get some grub after playing games there. My expectations at Waffle House aren't very high and this place isn't really bad, but the service was a bit slow and the waitress was quite unorganized. She did have to keep coming back to ensure we got everything and things came out in piece-meal fashion. Hoping this wasn't just \"part of the Waffle House experience\" as I've been to a couple where the food was good for what it is and the service was superb. Fortunately, she was very apologetic which made it seem worse than what it really was.  This may be the one particular server so I'd come back and try it again next time we're in the area since the waffles are pretty good."}
{"text":"Gotta temper your expectations here so the Rating is calibrated as such for a diner.  What else can you ask for late at night or early morning for breakfast.  We sat at the bar and were able to witness the cooks and staff work diligently the late night we came in.  They were very friendly and laughing with us as we waited.  The prices were low, of course, for typical breakfast food and the establishment was generally clean as they are relatively new.  The best deal looked like the \"All the Way\" hash browns.  It came with everything and the kitchen sink.  Definitely a must try especially after a night of drinking at the new nearby brewery...  The only issue is that there's limited seating, but they apparently do take-out now.  Fortunately, this part of town doesn't appear to get too slammed with late night party-goers."}
{"text":"Food is always consistent and tastes decent. Service is kind of blah. The place is kind of dirty and this includes the appearance of the employees. Eh...but its cheap and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"BEST OMELET EVER!  FLUFFY, MOIST  The cook made the most fluffy omelet I have ever had.  The waffles were so good too.  I asked for warm syrup and it made the twice as delicious.    They have a jukebox that plays 6 songs for $1.00.  Very cool!  This restaurant is small so go between breakfast and lunch or after lunch for great service."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and fri service. I just wish the restaurant was bigger. It's always packed since it is so small. Food is made when ordered and they use real eggs not the powder stuff. Waitresses are very efficient and friendly"}
{"text":"First time I walked out of a restaurant if they where my staff they all would be fired. Lady cocking my food burned omelet with unmelted cheese in middle.the hash-browns where wrong. Waitress drop customers food on floor. The place smelled like burnt food"}
{"text":"Get the pecan waffles, extra crispy, and side of bacon. Great late night food with my bestie."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Refuse to acknowledge their patrons. Too bad there aren't more places to go in this podunk town at 1230 am. Food was decent considering the time of day and the lackadaisical attitude of the cooks."}
{"text":"Wafflehouse is always a treat. Original style grill shop. If you haven't been because it looks low grade, well, it is, but on purpose. Order your custom hashbrowns, to go with your breakfast... Anytime!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed during my trip to WH.  The waffles are just ok...nothing \"oh wow\" factor about it.  This location is small.  The workers although some moved quickly, some were just taking their sweet time...service was spotty.  We sat on at the bar with a good view of the \"kitchen\".  It was cluttered and dirty.  I didn't enjoy listening to the workers complain about each other."}
{"text":"Never eat here, ever. My friends and I are scarred for life and we from now on will stick to safe late night breakfast places.   Our server was crazy, legitimately insane. She rambled on and on and on and immediately started picking on my friend who was clumsy and spilled a drink. So we cleaned up the mess because it was our fault, the server brings her another drink but this time it was in a to go cup and she says to my friend \"You better not spill this one or I'll have to cut you.\" And while she was saying this she pulls out her pink knife and clicks it open. What do we do in a situation where my best friends life is threatened? We laugh trying to diffuse the situation and make the crazy lady go away. She did after 10 minutes  of discussing how she hated her Hispanic lazy sister in law. After she leaves my other now silent friend whispers to me don't order anything that could harm you. I asked her why and she said simply \"I saw a bug.\" Great. Cockroaches are now added to our horrible experience. We all got a singular waffle and ate very quickly after that. We left as fast as we could. As soon as I got home I took a very long hot shower and changed into clean non Waffle House smelly clothes. Thankfully I didn't get sick but I will never again set foot inside that establishment. Ugh."}
{"text":"Ok, so we finally decided to eat at the waffle house... Bad choice! The food sucked and my server Kelly was not very nice.  Now I know why it's called the awful waffle!!"}
{"text":"Brad is my fucking guy ! This is the best service i have ever had at any breakfast joint in the whole country ! The hospitality was phenomenal, the atmosphere was crisp, clean, and well organized ! I will be returning here drunk as fuck again early in the am"}
{"text":"Sat at the counter and just waited there for 10 minutes without anyone ever acknowledging my existence. I got up and left. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Really good food and service was on point they make you feel at home great job guys since you walk in they are greeting you into explaining the menus to you really fast service keep up the good works"}
{"text":"This place always hits the spot when you are hungry late at night. I went to Waffle House last night and the food was delicious. The waitress was super sweet and she filled my coffee on time, i never had to ask for more more coffee. Great experience."}
{"text":"One of the few places that's just as amazing to eat sober or slightly inebriated. Patient, friendly staff. Very clean."}
{"text":"Waffle House has never been known for fantastic food, service or cleanliness but this location is an exception to the rule!  The place was spotless, Beth was the nicest waitress I've ever had (at ANY Waffle House), the food was served fast and everything was incredibly tasty.  Hailing from the East coast, I know a good Waffle House when I see one & this was it!"}
{"text":"1.30 am and I'm looking for breakfast.  Motored on up to Waffle House.  Delighted to see they are all wearing Santa hats.  Great service.  Great food.  Unfortunately 2 drugged out guys were trying to start trouble but the staff handled it very professionally.  Time to leave and I didn't want to run into the druggies if they were still outside.  Staff said they would walk me to my car but instead a really nice gentlemen picking up his to go order offered instead.  Kudos to good people."}
{"text":"Greasy, low quality, disgusting food.   It's getting 2 stars because the waitress was friendly and the menu doesn't pull any punches: the pictures look exactly like what you get. But what you get is pretty bad.   A friend ordered breakfast patties, they were maybe slightly larger than quarters. The hash browns had the consistency of greasy noodles. The signature waffle was just ok, but nowhere near good.   How these chains are all over the country I have no idea. Sorry, America."}
{"text":"Too good. The server Natalie was really really nice, food was incredible. Amazing experience"}
{"text":"Used to come here literally every day a few years back. It was outstanding everyday. I don't know what changed. They seemed to be mad when we walked in and looked like they did not even want us to order. They seemed to to try to deter us from ordering by saying things like \"You're ordering that? You know that is $_____? Right?\" The dude was cool but I can't vouch for the rest of the staff. They seemed to be annoyed the second we walked in and we ended up leaving half way through ordering due to their attitudes."}
{"text":"I have been to a total of one Waffle House that was decent.  This particular location follows more of the norm, being dirty and with low standards expected out of the employees.  The food is standard, including waffles and things involving texas toast.  The double patty melt on texas toast is what i get on the few occasions that I do visit this place.  The staff was especially funny.  They had very loud conversations with one another while my dining partner and I were trying to get down our greasy, yet expected, meal.  I then got to watch every employee examine a regular's new tattoo.  I learned that tattoo's are supposed to be deep and have straight lines, what a concept.  I wouldn't not come here, especially considering that there are hardly any food places open past midnight in this area, but I wouldn't come here by choice."}
{"text":"Not going to make this long. It's breakfast. But it's a little fun. I sat at the counter for the first time and it was cool. Fun to watch them cook and wash dishes felt like an old time diner from the 50's.   I've read some reviews people crying around about long cook times and having to wait for this or that. It's pretty much a given when coming here for breakfast But its worth it. So for those who don't like to wait for something good, please don't come back and that way the rest up us will get sat faster. ;)  If you haven't ever been to a Waffle House you should try it. The waffles are mandatory and it doesn't hurt to try a side of scrambled cheesy eggs. Jen had a omelet and I think not weighed about five pounds. With tip we still walked out for less than $20. Shout out to Keshaun who served us he was very pleasant and made the visit that much better."}
{"text":"Ohhh, what I wouldn't give for Waffle House to come to NY.  Maybe there is one, somewhere in the hinterland, where lumberjacks go to calorie up before a day of log hauling, but 'round NYC there is nowhere to go for hash browns 7 different ways including smothered and ALL THE WAY.  There is no place that has such perfect sausage gravy, such friendly servers, all of whom seem like they should have a sitcom named after them (\"Verle\", \"Sherrie\", \"Mame\", and that is just in one location!), no place where eating well and being full at the expense of your cardiovascular system is taken as seriously.  You can have your Cracker Barrels and your IHOPs and your White Castles, but a patty melt with bacon, sausage gravy on hash browns and a bowl of cheese grits at the Waffle House is really heaven on earth.  I haven't been in one since college in Bloomington, Indiana, where a WH walking distance from my apartment was the first place we would go after a night of too much drinking when we were hungover...I would get a Reuben sandwich and my roommate would have an omelette.  It appears that Reubens no longer appear on the menu, but the food is as good as I remember, the coffee is as weak, and they are all still open 24 hours.  I saw a Phoenix one from the highway as we tried to find Roberto's, and we made a special trip out there the following day so I could have my sausage gravy.  I have no idea if this is the actual one I went to, but they're all about the same thing--cheap good food.  Everything is made with love!  You'll love it here."}
{"text":"My husband and I had so many nights when we ate here. The food was so cheap which is what we loved at the time being we were first married and sometimes broke. We loved coming to this location as it was close to where we lived, the food was terrific."}
{"text":"Dear Waffle House,   I love you dearly.  You are like a comfy pair of shoes, or a really good boyfriend.  Your always available 24 hours a day, your always within a few miles of me, and your food is reliable comforting goodness.  I came home from work on Friday tired and very stressed out.  When I woke  up Saturday Morning, the mood was somewhat still present. I decided that I needed to treat myself to a warm hearty breakfast, and I knew I was overdue for a visit to a Waffle house.  This location is just like all the others, in regards to size and design.  It seems to be a more dated, possibly older version of some of the other waffle houses I have been in.  But, the food here is always good, reliable and tasty.  I had eggs, hash browns and raisin toast with coffee.  I cleaned my plate and left one happy camper!"}
{"text":"I was craving some wafflehouse, and after spending the AM at coffee buzz, I decided to drop in here.  Ive eate at this location before, but not in some time.  The service here is usually pretty consistant.  Its one of the cleaner locations too!  I ended up getting 3 eggs over easy, with toast and hashbrowns.  YUMMY.  Bill was cheap, and I was in and out in no time!  Will most likely return again when I am on this side of town. This location is one of my prefered Waffle Houses!"}
{"text":"I love Waffle House, especially for breakfast.  I usually get the same thing every time I come here, and its always tasty, filling, and really hits the spot.  This is my \"got to\" location for Waffle House's.  Not my favorite, but its closest to me for getting my fix.  I came here for the millionth time this morning, and got my 2 eggs over medium, hash browns and Cinnamon raisin toast with their apple butter spread.  Service was quick, and it was early enough that hardly anyone was there.  The only downside to this location is a two part thing.  First, their parking here is tight.  be careful!  If you drive a bigger car, or its busy, you probably will want to park a little farther back.  I've had to do it a few times myself, and its worth it versus getting hit or whatever in the parking lot.  Also, the place is located right next to the loop 101, and I've passed it more then once.  This is part of why its not my favorite location.  Aside from the cramped parking, it can be a pain to get to if your going during a heavy traffic time.  Kinda sucky.  I will be back in the future because I love Waffle house...this one has good service, but parking and getting in and out can be tricky at times."}
{"text":"Since moving, this seems to be the closest Waffle House to me and I've eaten here a few times already.  Place is just like all the other waffle houses in regards to menu and size, but let me tell you, this is probably one of the weirdest groups of clientele I have experienced at a Waffle House yet.  I've eaten at a few different Waffle Houses in the Valley and one would think that eating close to ASU's campus would bring in the college weirdos and a crazy mix of people. Surprisingly enough, its THIS waffle house has the crazy people mix! weird, huh? That's what I thought.  This time around I went yesterday morning with a friend whom I treated to breakfast after helping me out doing some heavy lifting in the apartment.  We scooted up to the waffle house to grab a quick bite to eat and even he noticed how random the people were here.  For starters, our waitress was a little koo koo.  We said something to her and she went into some random speech that neither one of us could understand. We tried to figure out what she was saying, but neither one of us could figure it out.  We had a good laugh about it later, but while she was rambling we just kind of smiled and nodded our heads.  Other notable people at this restaurant while we were there: young cute douche-bag sitting at the counter alone looking depressed eating his breakfast with his earphones in jamming to music.  Two old yuppie biker dudes who came in and were trying to pass as hardened bikers, but were clearly NOT.  (that roused a good laugh between said friend and I.  They were driving sissy dirt bikes, but dressing like Hells Angels, despite the fact that they were totally married church guys with wives at home who probably bossed them around a lot.)  Crazy waitress listed above who rambled incoherently, a few families and other people as well.  Definitely go here for the people viewing alone, and you can enjoy your standard issue waffle house breakfast like we did yesterday!"}
{"text":"It's called waffle house but it doesn't offer many waffle choices. Ordered cheesesteak melt at last, not bad but bit pricy for a melt. Small room, looks not very clean and tidy"}
{"text":"Filthy-- after killing the cockroach on the table -- we left without eating.  Noisy unpleasant atmosphere -- the waitress was at the table when we killed the cockroach and the manager explained that they are working on the issue-- and offered everyone in our group 20% off our next meal. I normally enjoy the fast diner atmosphere at waffle house -- but I think I'll stay away from this one."}
{"text":"The Waffle House team is great when you come in ask for Rhonda get a waffle get some hash scrambled cheese eggs bacon of course. Wash it down with some Alice's tea lemonade or Arnold Palmer. Of a great time as we were getting refueled."}
{"text":"The two of us were visiting the area and was excited to see there was a Waffle House here. We got Great friendly service and I enjoyed the pecan Waffle for the first time."}
{"text":"I love this place i used to travel alot and always would hit up a waffle house and when i moved to AZ i was happy. This place is great love the food classic diner food i wish there was one in CA"}
{"text":"First, I have to admit I've always been a big fan of Waffle House. Simple menu, good food, you can watch them cook your food, relatively inexpensive and the food comes out fairly fast. I think it's a love/hate thing with this chain though because I've heard many people call it \"Awful House\".  I went to this location twice this week for breakfast, once in the morning and once at night. I sat at the counter both times and both times was mostly impressed with the cook/manager. I had covered hash browns, a side of sausage and a waffle both times. A pecan waffle the first time and chocolate chip waffle the second. The food was excellent both times and the service was good.   This would be a solid 4 star review except the second time I went, I noticed a sewage odor. The manager was running the dishwasher right below where I was sitting so that probably was where the odor was coming from. Needless to say, no one wants to smell that odor while eating."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre but typical diner food. I really wish that you would use shredded cheese instead of American slices on your hash browns. Big portions and cheap prices. If you want a server that will sass you back ask for Birdie."}
{"text":"Ate there two nights in a row! Both nights the breakfast was cooking perfect! Eggs, waffle, bacon, hashbrowns were all made prefect by the cook Adam...I believe that was his name was"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great prices. This place felt like a mom and pop shop and not a big chain restaurant. We had fast seating and service. Our waitress was funny and on top of what we needed. My daughter spilled a full glass of orange juice all over the table and floor and our server came over with a towel and was so nice about it. Not irritated or anything and offered a refill right away! It was our first time there and we can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Very good Waffle House is always very good!!! Waitress Rose was AWSOME!! Thanks you Waffles are always very good!!!"}
{"text":"You guys. Our waitress was incredible but the chef... he was absolutely a jerk to her, and to us. He berated our poor waitress right in front of us, when all she was doing was trying to call out our order (and made it super awkward). Then we tried to sing happy birthday to my cousin, and he actually yelled at us and told us to stop because he couldn't hear the other waitress calling an order out. I know it's a little obnoxious, but it takes less than 30 seconds to sing Happy Birthday, he could have handled it much better.  I feel sorry for the staff that has to work with him."}
{"text":"I usually love Waffle Houses.  I try to go whenever I'm in a town that has them.  But if I'm ever in Goodyear again I'll be avoiding this one.  I had breakfast there yesterday.  My order included sausages.  When my order came out, no sausage.  The waitress immediately caught that and told the cook.  This lead to a 5-minute play argument between her, the cook and a third person.  All the while they were screwing around having fun I noticed that nobody was making my sausages.  It took a while to finally get the final item of my order.  By then I was almost finished with my meal.  To the managers of this restaurant I'm all for a fun, playful work environment, but your staff's first job is SERVING THE PAYING CUSTOMERS!!  Not screwing around with each other."}
{"text":"They don't have these in California. Made a pilgrimage to this particular Waffle House during our last trip to Scottsdale, before hitting the Musical Instrument Museum right down the road. Food/quality is consistent and pretty much the same at every location. Limited old school menu of eggs, meats, starches (grits, yum), in different combinations; and yes, waffles. As always, everything was perfectly cooked and tastes decent for the price - which is incredibly low compared to just about anyplace else around. I'm not looking to drop $100 so my kids can eat breakfast at the \"Scottsdale Farm-to-Table Brunchery.\" They are HAPPY here. It seems like a lot a food when you order, but somehow, someway, you manage to eat it all.  What we really liked was the service. Everything was super fast and efficient. Our waitress was absolutely delightful - commenting on how polite our kids were, telling us little stories, checking up on us every couple of minutes. Great value for a fun and satisfying breakfast experience."}
{"text":"I was sitting at counter, saw the guy behind the stove drop a steak from the refrigerator, he took it off the floor and threw it on the grill.. not looking to see if anyone even  looked at him at all. Unbelievable"}
{"text":"I ordered steak and eggs and it was very bland. There was a lot of fat on it. It didn't taste like steak, but more like a processed meat. I added caramelized onions were not caramelized at all. So i don't know why they would call it that. I was even disappointed in the toast. It wasn't crunchy, it was more soggy if that.  Hash browns are average.   Server was sub par. The girl who took our name to sit down was very rude. Her name is Audrey and she obviously doesn't posses basic customer service skill."}
{"text":"I now feel obligated to write this review, why?   I've just relocated to the area from DC, staying at a hotel nearby.  Decided to have breakfast here before going house hunting, so I did and it was a very good experience.  All of the staff were very professional and my steak & cheese sandwich was delicious!  After a long day and driving all around the area, I decided to have a late lunch (between 2:30-3:00pm).  I stopped by again, was very slow only a few customers inside.   There were only two people working, Young (chef) and Khadijah (waitress).  I must admit and stress that they were HIGHLY professional, very polite, caring, and punctual.  Honestly, they made me feel very special and as if I was at my own home! I cannot say enough, both of them are an asset to this WH and I would steal them away IF I was a restaurant owner! They made sure my food, ordered the same thing again :), was good and checked on me often to make sure I was satisfied!   I certainly didn't expect such high class and professional service from Waffle House.  These two individuals certainly changed my perception! I would return here again and again!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Terrible service. Took 20+ minutes to get food, and then the orders were not completed (hash browns weren't done right, waffle came out way later than the rest of the food). She brought out multiple drinks for each of us at our already crowded table. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Waffle House is always hit or miss, but this time they got it right. My friends and I visited immediately after having a poor experience at another restaurant. We walked in and found a booth immediately. Our waitress came over shortly after. She was pleasant. We all looked famished and I'm sure she could tell. She took our orders right away. Now, usually I'm a huge fan of the Chocolate Chip waffle, but at most Waffle House restaurants they tell me I can't have the chips baked in. It makes no since, but several waitresses have told me that. However, our waitress explained that it could and should be done. Sooooo, I had a Chocolate Chip Waffle with hash browns, scrambled eggs and toast. It blessed my life. My friends ordered something. They enjoyed it. Our experience was great. We had our food in about 15 minutes. It was cooked fresh and exactly as requested. Our waitress was nice and this Waffle House location will be my go-to whenever I'm in Charlotte on the hunt for a late night bite."}
{"text":"Dee is the jewel of this place.  I want to bring her back to Chicago with me!!! Wow, personality, warm and inviting I swear I walked into a friends house.  I LOVE the patriotism GOD BLESS AMERICA! Everyone knew each other's name, just simply amazing.  I will rave about THIS place to all my snowbirds back home.  So so so so sooooo clean and upbeat.  I'd really consider this the heart of breakfast in Arizona. Thank you yelp!"}
{"text":"Today was my boyfriend and I, first time eating here! It was amazing and such great customer service. We told our server that it was our first time and she recommend us so many options. I don't know how to spell her name, (sorry). But she was super friendly, made us feel comfortable and welcomed. Way better service and food here than at the Denny's across the street hahaha! I ordered an omelet which was soooooo tasty! It was stuffed with ham, cheese, jalapeños, onions, yummmm! Best omelet I've had in a while! It's a simple omelet but bursting with flavor! I'm glad we decided to give it a try."}
{"text":"Called three times to place a to go order and they hung up on me and didn't answer the phone. When I drove by the employees were standing around doing nothing.... so wack."}
{"text":"I only reviewed this place on June 3rd--why do such a negative update?  In a word, service--or lack thereof.  Our bad experience started with a waitress named \"Dulce\" or \"Dulcie\" or something like that.  She and another male employee were all that were running the place that night.  We sat down, and she, without any kind of \"pardon\" or \"excuse me\", starts pushing my cell phone and our hands and menus out of her way on the table so she can put down the utensils.  Quite rude, and not the end of it.  The male employee was somewhat nicer, but he and her began to engage in a kind of fake belligerence in front of customers--yelling at each other from across the restaurant and using profanity.  Not pleasant at all.  Our food was okay, but showed some degree of not caring--my daughter's chocolate chip waffle didn't have the chips mixed in.  They were thrown on and then burnt on the griddle.  I have been to this location a number of times and this is my first bad experience--unfortunately, it was a lulu.  Hopefully it won't be repeated or I will be going elsewhere for my waffles from here on."}
{"text":"What an amazing service at this location last night. I think all big chain restaurants could learn from the ladies who were working here last night. Greeted as soon We walked in and right away asked what we wanted to drink.  Our server was excellent I wish I could remember her name. She displayed excellent customer service. Treated us like we were friends but also with professionalism.  Madea who was cooking our meal also displayed perfect service. She was talking to us as she cooked our meal asking us how we liked our bacon cooked as well as perfecting our over medium eggs.   You ladies did amazing it was nice to see people enjoying what they do !"}
{"text":"I normally don't eat or yelp about corporate restaurants but I was very impressed with the Waffle house on University, not Baseline that's a different story. I'm not going to say that the food is great but as said before it is what it is and the workers are doing the best they can with their restaurant.   -Clean -Good service -Open Clean Kitchen -Juke Box"}
{"text":"I used to live in Texas and live in SoCal now, and there are no Waffle Houses here. My pregnant butt had been craving it, so we drove to AZ for a mini road trip and took advantage to eat here. Now the food was as I remember it, except pricier, lol. What makes me give this place 1 star is a certain employee that was working during the time we were there. The place was pretty full except for a couple of booths. When one of the waitresses asked him if we could sit in those booths, he said they were already reserved. It's Waffle House. Since when does Waffle House accept reservations? The hate coming from this douche was obvious. Everyone else was super nice, especially our waitress. She cleaned another booth for us so we could sit down. After we sat down, people walked in and they were just able to sit there, as if nothing. So it was blatantly obvious that he didn't want us to sit there. Waffle House has been in the news a lot recently, and everyone knows why. I'm very disappointed that Waffle House allows people like that to work there. Even living in Texas, I'd never experienced that before. I have always had good experiences, and the people working there have always been super nice. I guess things have changed in the past couple of years."}
{"text":"Something has drastically changed. I have been patronizing and enjoying this Waffle House location since the early 80's. It's always been great food, fast service, and exceptional employees. The past several months have seen this all change. What used to be a well oiled machine has turned into chaos and poor service. The current staff with some exceptions looks overwhelmed and confused. I see dirty tables and customers waiting, people lined up at the cash register while multiple customers were asking their wait staff for their bill so they could leave. A clear departure from what used to be poetry in motion, food orders being yelled in to cooks that looked and worked like a real team. A greeter at the door that when not opening the door and inviting you in was cleaning dirty tables and helping with the cash register. A word of advice from a business owner, whatever you're trying, stop, it isn't working. Turn back the clock, up the staff, find your stride and get back to doing business the way it used to be done."}
{"text":"Every time I am here, always have great hot food and service.    Love to get the allstar.  It comes with a waffle, two eggs, a meat and toast.  Very filling.    The restaurant is always clean.  Their sanitation rating is a 98."}
{"text":"Went here because I was staying at the airport hotel 1 night. It wasn't ideal that I had to walk in an unknown area late at night, but it was a short walk and I was happy I did.  Staff was very friendly, there was good music playing on the juke box and the good was served quickly. I actually thought the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich I had was better than some big time BE&C sandwiches at well know eateries."}
{"text":"I can't beleive I am giving a Waffle House 5 stars, but I am. Only because I could not give them more!!  We had a party of 6, so we were split up. 4 of us at the counter and my wife and I at a table behind them. Kinda nice actually, as it sort of felt like were were on a date ; )  The waitress (I wish I could remember her name, but it has been two weeks since our trip. I think it was Amanda?... sorry if I got it wrong) was out of this world! She knew the menu inside and out, made great suggestions, was really friendly, and could not have been more attentive.   Food was really good. My only complaint is that they did not have a \"nap\" area for us to sleep off our food coma.  Will visit whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!!! I went to for lunch on 3/6/18 at 12:37pm...we walk in and the place looked awful!!! It's trash all over the place the waitress informed us that there would be a 25 min wait because the cook was cleaning the grill. My sister were starving but we opted to wait. The employees were arguing in front of the customers it was very unprofessional. I'm still here waiting on my food and the place is still a mess! There are 6 employees here and not one has came by to sweep the trash off the floor or clean the tables that previous customers have left."}
{"text":"Today ...What we ordered (to go) from Waffle House #1797 in Tempe, AZ:  1st Meal - 3 eggs, double order bacon, hash browns, grits, raison toast;  2nd Meal - 3 eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, toast, waffles.  WHAT WE PAID (Cash):  $23.77  Missing FROM BOTH MEALS was ALL THE BLASTED MEAT !   There was NO bacon in either meal; There was NO sausage; There was NO meat in either meal !!  And the receipt ...it was a \"REPRINT\" (??) so NONE of our ordered items appeared (??!!????). What's going on at THIS Waffle House?????!!    What kind of con game are they up to????  We are not NOT happy!   We called the Waffle House immediately & they offered NO explanation or remedy; told us to go online & complain. So here we are!!!  This is the SECOND bad experience with this Waffle House #1797. The 1st bad experience is when we used our credit card at this SAME Waffle House ...then 1 day later, our bank called & said \"possible fraud activity on the account\" and the amount was HUNDREDS (100's) of dollars !!  Fortunately, our bank watches closely & they declined the charge, canceled our credit card and issued us a new card with new numbers.  THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!  ...and it's the LAST time we'll go to THIS Waffle House or any other Waffle House !! And we're certainly going to let our friends & family know about BOTH incidents, so they dine elsewhere too."}
{"text":"The charm of this Waffle House shone through during a late breakfast on a somewhat lazy Saturday afternoon. My buddy and I selected this restaurant simply because it was en route to our pressing weekend chores. The interior is dated and the staff are friendly and talkative, but this place has just the kind of small-diner charm we were in the mood for. They even have an old-timey jukebox in the corner that plays 45's.  The prices are completely reasonable. Throw down $7.50 for the breakfast All-Star Special... it's a no-brainer. You get eggs, bacon, toast, grits (or hashbrowns) and, of course, a waffle. You will be tempted to modify your order, however, as there are a surprising number of options available, including eight different additions to your hashbrowns: onions, cheese, ham, tomatoes, jalapeños, mushrooms, chili or sausage gravy. I dug the banana nut waffle, as I was craving pecans from my past memories of Southern comfort food.  All told, Waffle House hits the spot when you feel the urge to stuff your gullet."}
{"text":"I've been to Waffle Houses in different parts of the country, usually to slow down absorption of that night's excesses, so this is a bit of a re-discovery for me. After stumbling upon several unusual and fancy breakfast/brunch places in the Phoenix metro area, my usual dining partner and I decided to go the standard route and check out this Waffle House. We wanted waffles and we wanted bacon and we wanted hash browns... but they gotta be CRISPY! We wanted the traditional spread of American breakfasts without paying too much money. And this Waffle House delivered spectacularly!  The All-Star Breakfast is the way to go. You get eggs, you get a waffle, you get breakfast meats, you get hash browns (and when you order them crispy, they are perfectly browned and crunchified!). You even get toast with that, in case the carbohydrate content of your meal isn't enough. This meal harkened back to the days when a healthy American breakfast always included toast in addition to your entree carbs (thanks grain lobby!)  The service here is fast, friendly and efficient. The open kitchen lets you eyeball the process as the line cook chefs up your grubble. And the condiment selection far exceeds most people's requests. They typically offer red Tabasco, green (jalapeno) Tabasco, ketchup, steak sauce, bizarre house salsa in a bottle, steak sauce, Heinz 57 sauce, and even Worcestshire. I guess some of the less obvious condiments are for lunch and dinner meals, in case your not here to order breakfast (which I'm guessing is available anytime). I did venture to eat the chicken/bacon sandwich here once and was totally pleased. You get a side of hash browns!  I'm sold! I love this place. Even though I'm a big fan of unusual, gourmet and gastropub riffs on breakfast and brunch, sometimes I don't require that my food has been dressed in unicorn tears. I just want the standard traditional American breakfast... and this Waffle House excels in exactly that type of fare!"}
{"text":"I love this Waffle House, not only is it close by but the staff is great and the food is good..."}
{"text":"Looked like a bunch of children working there.. I ordered chocolate chip waffles & got plain, basic as fuck waffles. Halfway through eating my plain ass waffle, I realized homegirl gave us HONEY instead of syrup. No fuckin wonder my food taste weird. She never came to check on us.. One of the waffles was burnt as shit. Eggs were runny. They got the water order right though so that's cool man."}
{"text":"The food was good, very good but the place is annoyingly small. Our group was 6 people and they crammed us into a small booth that did not fit us all at all. What annoyed me the most is that they sat a group of 5 into a table that would have for us much more comfortably, plus we got there before they did yet they sat them first. Also their hot sauce selection was limited to Tabasco, Tabasco sucks, at least throw some chalula or tapatio out there for those with discerning taste. The grits were good as always, service was ok, table was sticky and we had a very rushed and uncomfortable meal."}
{"text":"I'm going to start adding the TIME from order placed to TIME food arrives on my Reviews.    First I ordered the ALL-STAR SPECIAL  Waffle, 2 eggs, hash browns... smothered & covered, 2 pieces of sausage, EXTRA side of bacon. and reg. Coffee  My breakfast date ordered a Ham, Egg, and Cheese sandwich. OJ w/ a cup of ice.  The food arrived in 8:36 mins."}
{"text":"Their service was good, nice ppl. The food is absolutely junk. I feel like they got a group of kindergartens kids cooking microwavable gas station food in the back and that's what they're serving. Don't go there. Bad waffles :("}
{"text":"For a diner the food is really good and flavorful!  Service is friendly!  Tamara was really nice and checked in on us several times.  Great experience all around."}
{"text":"Horrible workers. Came in with my friends and they thought it would be funny to tell us they're closed. First time visiting waffle house and do not plan on ever returning. They need some sort of managerial worker here, or at least a new one."}
{"text":"I was starving after being sick for the last 4 days. Waffle & hash browns were awesome!!  Hubby had a cheeseburger that was good. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a 1, run don't walk...it was so bad I called the health dept...while paying I saw a floor drain that was clogged, there was so much slime it looked alive"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, although not the place you come if you're counting calories.  I had to try the waffles here, and I am really glad I did.  They were buttery and delish and the hashbrowns are amazing.  I'd definitely go again.    My friend ordered eggs, pancakes and potatoes and said they were close to the best he's ever had.  You probably wouldn't think that driving by...the restaurant kind of looks run down, but if you come in and give it a try, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I just can't. After eating here I leave feeling awful. And it's happened more than once. This is only a good spot late at night after a concert and nothing else is opened."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday morning while visiting NC. Place was pretty busy. Food was exactly what you'd expect from Waffle House. Cheap and mostly grease, but still not bad."}
{"text":"As far as Waffle Houses go, this one was pretty clean.  I enjoyed the waffle and their coffee was surprisingly good.   Our waitress was probably well over 60 years old and she was the hardest working waitress I have ever seen - she hustled"}
{"text":"Years ago, I attended my graduation in Macon, GA. I stayed with a couple of dear friends, one of whom had graduated from the same master's program as I did.  We were all heading our separate ways on my final day there. One of them suggested going to Waffle House after hearing about my love for waffles. I loved my first experience there that I tend to visit a Waffle House when one is in the area.  I was thrilled when I saw a number of Waffle House places around Charlotte. After visiting the Billy Graham Library, it was around 2 pm when I decided to hit this Waffle House.  I pulled into the wrong lot. I ended up parking in the Pier One lot next to Waffle House. It wasn't that busy and I thought that I would pop in after lunch. Sadly, that didn't happen, but I thank that store for allowing me to park there.  I walked in to Waffle House and sat down. It's funny that I seem like such a regular, but I am far from it. I took one of the laminated menus from the condiments area and figured that I wanted the all-star breakfast. It consisted of toast, grits, two eggs (I got mine overhard), sausage, and a waffle. It is also one of the best deals as far as food and pricing go.  My server was polite and efficient. Moments later, my food came.  Everything was delicious. My overhard eggs were done perfectly. My sausages were yummy. I always gets grits over hashbrowns when I am in the States and love them. My waffle was delicious, as expected.  The only downer was being rushed to pay when I was still eating. The rush happened because one of the other servers was leaving for the day and my bill somehow affected her. This incident put a bit of a damper on my experience. Thus, my rating is 3.5.  The washroom was clean. I have no complaints.  A young couple came in to the eatery halfway through my meal. They both ordered pancakes and wanted whipped cream. I overheard the server indicate that the place no longer serves whipped cream. So, if you love whipped cream, you are out of luck. I have never been big on that stuff, so it doesn't affect me.  I would come back for the decent food. I hope that I don't end up feeling rushed when I do.  (151)"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of times while staying at the Hotel Tempe.  First off, the staff here is super nice.  The food was excellent and the coffee was good.  My only complaint is that at times the staff looked a little overwhelmed.  The taste of the food and the friendliness of the staff makes the wait worthwhile. I will be back again in November!"}
{"text":"Nice staff but just nasty food.  I tried to think of a reason for 2 stars but couldn't.   The only thing going through my mind was the high risk for food poisoning.   I could not recommend this place to anyone for any reason.  There are so many better and cleaner places.  The breakfast sandwich is a over easy egg Kraft cheese slice and cheap bread.  You could do so better in your own kitchen.   It was disappointing for kids.  My dry eggs and soggy bacon was no better."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in, there was already something wrong with my experience. No one greeted us, so me and my friends (group of 5) decided to find a seat on our own. Once I sat down the cook told us they could not serve us because they had no plates. Once we didn't leave after she stated that, she proceeded to make a smart remark to convince us to leave. After she said that, we all left and took our business elsewhere. I don't know why this place is 24 hours if they're not able to function. We went while there was one other customer there! This place was not even busy, if it was busy I would understand why they had no plates. But if they had one other customer in the building, I don't understand why they had no plates. Horrible experience and would never go again."}
{"text":"Nasty place overpriced $2 for nasty coffee just gross people service was good bill was high for nasty"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning. Service was excellent and the staff was very friendly.  Food was great, well prepared and cooked to order. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I had been to this particular waffle house; the first experience being God awful. Terrible service, their tea had soured, and the food was incredibly poor - even for waffle house.  I decided to give it a second chance, and in hindsight that was my first mistake. They were slammed when we got in, and we're not greeted, and almost walked out. But saw one open booth and decided to take it. The waitress apologized for the wait and took our orders.  My problem doesn't lie in the customer service we were given; she took care of us quite well.  The food, however, is a completely different story. The toast was cold, I had shells still in my scrambled eggs, and there was a hair in my hashbrowns. Never again."}
{"text":"Early Saturday morning meal needed before the crowds kicked in. I come here often. I'm just picking with my food being served correctly and in a particular order. But that's just me (I like my waffle cooked well & want to eat that 1st vs the other stuff). Staff is always friendly and I know what I'm getting."}
{"text":"Well this is. Waffle house player, what else do you expect except the best waffles money can buy? The breKfast menu is pretty vast and lets be real the hashbrowns are only rivaled by cracker barrel. All the options on the hashbrowns are amazing i get them smothered covered and topped. The waffles you can add choolate chips and peanut butter and just game change everything. The texas cheese steak sandwich is so cheesy and amazing. They dont mess up your eggs those are great too. But dont expect much out of a steak there. Its a waffle house bud not a ruth chris. Literally cant go wrong and there is always good hardsorking people there. Love it!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great, the food was okay, the coffee was not coming in fast enough LOL, and the worst part is the cleanliness. I felt like I was sitting in an area where a child had a lollipop and decided to spread the lollipop all over the table and seats. It was not a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst, I was sick 10 min after leaving here. I don't expect much from a Waffle House and I was still disappointed. Never again Waffle House, Never Again!!!"}
{"text":"The Waffle House is a good ole fashion American breakfast diner serving waffles that you can eat any time of the day breakfast, lunch, or dinner. They are that great.   Prices and proportions are reasonable. Best traditional breakfast diner hands down!   I'm sooooo pissed SoCal does not have a Waffle House!! Hopefully soon in the future."}
{"text":"Mmm..waffles!!  Though it may not look like much from the outside, this place serves some amazing waffles at a great price! It's your typical diner setting and my friend and I sat at the counter.  We both had the simple waffle and hash browns.  When I first looked at the waffle, I thought it was small, but it does fill you up! The hash browns were delicious, but I would've liked it more crispy. The waffle, hash browns and a cup of coffee was only $6.80! Not too shabby. They have other items on the menu as well like pancakes but it's waffle house - I suggest getting a waffle.  The people here are so welcoming and nice.  Definitely a great spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The service was near horrible. Sat down at counter I was seating there for 10 minuets nobody would approach us? A both opened up so we went sat there the table still had dishes from previous people. But it took them almost 20 minutes come clean the table and take are order! But once they took my order my food come quickly! But the server won't even come check on you? This place is badly organized!! But the food was good!"}
{"text":"Ahh the good ol' Waffle House. Who doesn't love breakfast all day??  This location is great. The staff is usually friendly and welcoming and the best part... It's always clean :D   It does get crowded at the usual busy times for breakfast (weekend mornings) but usually it has a good turn around so if there's a wait, no worries! Play a song on the digital jukebox they have :-)   It's in a good location, and because of where it's placed, there's a ton of natural sunlight to peek in. But if the all star breakfast has you feeling a bit guilty about your completely satisfying food baby.. There is a gym across the street :p HA!  But in all seriousness, this is one of the better locations for Waffle House so if you're hankerin' for some bacon or want your browns smothered and covered, I would really recommend this one over any in the surrounding areas."}
{"text":"Rude employees. Two of them were talking so loud my husband I couldn't hear each other. My food was just ok. I always get the same thing when I go to Waffle House. Half my order was good, the other half not so much. My husband said his food was good. I gave it two stars instead of one for my husband's meal being good."}
{"text":"Visited for breakfast, food was decent, the waitress was nice, courteous and patient. The only thing I didn't like was the establishment wasn't as clean as it should be, the floor didn't look like it hadn't been swept in a Lil while, and the bathroom was disgusting! It looked like someone threw up and they just lifted the toilet seat up and left the throw up on the seat, so nay for cleanliness, especially in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Fast stop good breakfast for dinner. Grits were prefect and waffle as always was a treat . Skip fast food and eat a meal."}
{"text":"I have passed waffle houses for years and I have never dined at one. Was in town with friends and stopped in for breakfast. The place is a small diner. I could tell it was new when we pulled into the parking lot as Waffle House typically appear to be Shabby from the outside. We were greeted at the door by a young man who was very nice. It was 4 of and no tables at the time. he seated us. we waited about 5 minutes and the counter became available. Our orders were quickly taken and our food was quickly served. I had a waffle, hash browns with onions and a fried egg with cheese. The breakfast tastes good as if it was made at home in the kitchen. The waffle was served hot and fresh off of the waffle iron. The eggs were real shell eggs cracked and cooked. The hash browns were delicious. The place isn't fancy because it's not meant to be. The food is good and the people working there are working hard. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I love the Waffle House, and being from California, don't get to eat here enough.  Stopped at this one around 0130 on a Sunday morning.  3 of the 4 of us in our group were greeted right away, but they forgot me.  I mentioned that to them, got a free waffle.  Great staff here, and the food is always the same, which in my opinion, is great grub!"}
{"text":"Another Waffle House stop, another good meal.  That's one thing I love about the Waffle House, no matter where you find one, they're usually the same good grub at each."}
{"text":"Service was terrible!  Usually very pleased with Waffle House, we try to stop at least once when we travel in Ohio.  We were very disappointed on our visit this time,  the waitress was not friendly at all, service was slow and the waitress had a bad attitude.  Definitely will not be visiting this Waffle  house again."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Waffle House, right. I've been here late at night and called in, which was the case for my latest visit. I was getting my car washed at AutoBell and called in my order. Some Waffle Houses don't take call in orders, but it's at the discretion of the store. Fortunately, this one does. My order was ready and accurate upon pickup. No complaints. The food here was consistent with other WHs. I had a chicken melt plate and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I was traveling from Statesville to Charlotte and stopped to get gas at the BP nearby. I Called in my order before arriving and it was ready by the time I arrived. The staff was nice and my food was ready by the time I arrived. Food was consistent with all other Waffle Houses."}
{"text":"I just love the waffle house!  It doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't. Good food at a good price with fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Came early on a Saturday morning and beat the crowd.  By the time we left, there was a huge crowd of people and a line.  The food was good.  Ordered a waffle, of course.  The service was quick.  The only issue, which is typical of all Waffle House restaurants I've been to across the country, was the bathroom.  I don't know what it is about bathrooms at Waffle House, but they always seem to be dirty and in need of cleaning.  At least this one had a decent supply of toilet paper."}
{"text":"Very clean, very friendly and fast. My favorite waffle house to get bacon and waffles."}
{"text":"My wife and I had brunch. Waffles were great  and portions large. April and Young were  top notch we felt wecome from the minute we entered."}
{"text":"I wish I had something positive to say about this location but I don't. I had been to the Waffle House before many of times down south and took a liking to them.    Our whole experience here was jus bad from the beginning. When we pulled up it wasn't crowded which was fine. we said perfect because we were from out of town and had been looking for a place to eat since it was late. Our waiter had a attitude and was rude. They messed up on our simple order. Some of the food was half cooked. The other was over cooked. They didn't bring any condiments until I had to say something. I'm like who eats a waffle with not butter or syrup. Service and food was bad. They never even came back to check up on us.   To top it off towards the end of our meal they started counting their register drawer over in our corner. I'm like u guys can't do that on the other side where nobody was eating!?! I'm like we are eating here. Then we didn't want to hear their stupid ass conversations. This place gets 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"Is there really a bad Waffle House? Sometimes they have a bad cook, but those cooks don't last long.  This Waffle House was like any other. Great breakfast, fast and fresh. Delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic Waffle House. Chef Jernell (not sure the spelling) was spot-on with the meal. Our server Kendra was great. Nice meal after a spring break day at Carowinds."}
{"text":"Waffle House seems to be a lower tier version of other major chain breakfast establishments.  I went here for breakfast in the evening with two other friends and came out with mixed feelings.  First of all, the atmosphere in the restaurant just seemed a little too dirty and sketchy.  There were some strange characters in the store.  Perhaps it was just that night or it's that part of town, but nevertheless I felt a little off put throughout as a result.  The food was nothing special.  I got a standard two-egg breakfast with hash browns.  It was perfectly acceptable, and I would rate is as average.  You could certainly get better at other breakfast places.  Service was fairly good.  It took us a while to get our check and cash out, but it didn't ruin the evening.  Honestly, if the atmosphere were a little more inviting I'd have felt a lot more comfortable with the place."}
{"text":"no utensils even after we got our food, trash on top of the trash. also the bathroom sink wasn't working so couldn't really wash my hands. management needs to really take charge and retrain their employees. overall 1/10"}
{"text":"I love me some Waffle House. This location was very crowded on a Sunday afternoon. It took a while to get my order. The food was great though. Can't wait to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Thank you, Cooks and Servers!!! Another lovely \"batch\" to keep me complacent 'til midweek. These people are phenomenal when it comes to dishing up a 15 plate order to go. For me. For later. Maybe I will share."}
{"text":"Waffle House has a certain cold, institutional weirdness about it. Combined with a folksiness that seems unforced but so strangely out of place, it just adds to the weirdness. It's like an episode of Hee-Haw directed by David Lynch.  Waffle House--and not just in terms of interior appearance-- is weird in a Mentos-commercial sort of way. It's an odd blend of shapes and textures that make you think it was somehow cooked up in lab by space aliens based on things they observed about our culture remotely, quickly prototyped in a large hanger, then deployed to our planet overnight in part of a program to observe and study our behavior.  The menus have the odd appearance of a parts catalog for a Pakistani-made bazooka. Odd, drop-shadowed fonts that just seem  . . . wrong in some way. The graphic designers for this place must just love their jobs. But then the food pictured is all Southern-style good-ol' boy trucker grub. Including grits. This is the weirdest one can make waffles, eggs and grits look without really trying at it.  The servers for the most part are friendly and efficient, though some of them speak in accents that probably haven't been commonly heard since around the time of the Civil War. I think there are still closed-off little mountain enclaves where people go from adolescence to military service to indentured labor at Waffle House. That's just the way of it.  The food seems ample, but it really doesn't satisfy. Shove a plate full of the oddly-textured waffles slathered in butter substitute into your mouth and you'll be hungry for lunch two hours later. It's not cheap, either.  So why does it exist? Setting aside for a moment the alien-conspiracy theory, I think Waffle House offers a minimal level of edible items around the clock. They are usually clean and located near highways.   And that's about it."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy going to Waffle House but my experience lastnight truly left me in awe. I have never had a bad experience going out until tonight. My waitress was so rude I couldn't even believe it ! She was rude the moment we sat down. She kept rolling her eyes , huffing and puffing when we asked for something and when we told her the check was separate it was unbelievable. We weren't being rude and didn't give her a hard time. But she was unbelievable ! It's not like she was having a bad day or she had a table earlier that changed her mood because she was so kind to her other table but with my table she was just so rude eye rolling and everything ! I did say something to her because of how rude she was I just couldn't stay quiet anymore! Even her coworkers were on my side ! That says a lot !!! I don't know her name she was an older white lady with reddish hair ! I truly hope she gets fired because the way she was ... was just crazy ! Idk if she didn't like Hispanics or what but she was ridiculous ! I even left her a tip because I serve so I get it but she honestly didn't even deserve my tip ! Because she was horrible ! I'm still shocked at how she was with us !"}
{"text":"I have lived nearby the Waffle House chain for years, and I had never gone there before, until I got stuck in Charlotte for a day and found one near my hotel.  I went in of course to order...well...a waffle, because I would be remiss to not order a waffle at a place called the Waffle House.   As for the waffle. It was pretty good. It was a little too sweet and tangy for my taste. Plus is was a bit flat. I can tell they are designed to hold food on top of them, and I think it would be great if paired with fruit. Alas, I was trying to conserve money, so I ordered it sans fruit and opted for maple syrup and butter to adorn it. They made it even more sweet, so I ended up just eating the waffle itself which was sweet enough for me.   As for the customer service, it was fine. The woman who took my order did a good job and was quick to take my order even though it was packed. there was a man sitting next to me at their bar area next to me, who kept trying to sell me these coupon books, which frustrated me quite a bit, but he seemed to be a regular and was interacting with the staff quite a bit so they didn't tell him to leave me alone, when it should have been obvious that I was really tired and jet lagged and I didn't want to talk.    However, as far as cleanliness goes, this place needed some sprucing up. First, I got a dirty glass with my water. Second, the woman who took my order gave me dirty napkins. Third, the floor was sticky in some areas.   While I can understand that in a rush, sometimes these things can happen. Those issues happened too many times in the space of an hour for me to really give it a pass, which downgrades the review a bit.  Still, it was not a bad first experience. I would probably visit another waffle house in the future, but I would steer clear of this place if you are in need of something to eat late at night."}
{"text":"Your basic Waffle House. Only a lot messier. I will pass in the future on this location."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back to the desert.  Good food.  Fast.  Friendly.   Great customer service.  What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I dropped in with three coworkers to grab some supper after work around 10:00pm. They were not busy, maybe 3rd full. We waited for almost ten minutes and the waiter walked by us multiple times without acknowledging us. He watched another employee cook some of the time. When they began to take the order of someone who came in after us, We left without getting food."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to go here for a while and finally decided \"what the heck\" and got some breakfast! The place is super small! Not at all busy on a Tuesday morning. We were able to seat our selves and only waited about 3-5 minutes for our waitress. I couldn't really understand her due to her thick accent, but she was very nice and brought our drinks. Once we were ready we ordered and our food was brought out in anywhere from 10-15 minutes- or even shorter! Food was pretty good, only about 9$ (we got some American breakfast which is like a build your own). The only negative thing I had was that I didn't like the lemonade and only had about two sips before ordering a water and explaining why, but I was still charged. I didn't complain, and if I did I'm sure it would've been taken off. Another thing was the waffles were super thin- good but I expected better for it being called a \"Waffle House\" also wish there were more options other than pecans and chocolate chips (which I ordered). Over all a simple diner with great service (:"}
{"text":"Went to Waffle House for dinner last week. It was chilly inside, as usual. Ordered a waffle and hashbrowns covered (with cheese) and chunked (ham). Our server took a long time to bring us our waters. Shortly after, the food came out. It tasted very good, but then our server disappeared for the entire meal. Didn't get a refill until the very end. The workers behind the counter were having a very loud conversation about drag queens. Weird."}
{"text":"I havent been to a Waffle House in many moons because they are not around my neck of the woods too much. It was darn good. The waffles were thin and tasty. It was not sparkling clean in there but it was kept up. I was in and out the two times I went during the weekday around 0730. The bacon is cut a little too thin but it is very good. Coffee isnt the best. If you want a nice breakfast without the BS of the other places, it wont disappoint."}
{"text":"Fast! Very fast service. Coffee was ok. Eggs were good. Waffles were whatever but we needed to have breakfast. Right off the freeway."}
{"text":"Great little place, food was fast and hot.. just as expected. Our waitress was Patricia and she is amazing and very attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Soooooooo prior to this experience, I had never been to a Waffle House. I spent years with people asking me questions like \"Where did you go after the bar/club in college?\" (answer: Cook Out) and \"How have you never been?\" (answer: I just haven't *shrug*)  So one Saturday morning my fiancé said he wanted us to order it to go and sit on our deck to eat it. He ran in for us while our puppy and I waited in the car. He ordered a bacon cheese steak sandwich for him, medium hashbrown for me and biscuits and gravy for us to share. Now the parking lot was packed but as I sat in the car, I saw 5 vehicles come, go inside, order their to go items and leave with them in the time that we sat there. After 35 minutes of sitting, I called my fiancé inside to figure out what was going on. He said that he asked multiple times about the status of our order and was told the delay was the biscuit and gravy. I think that's BS and they are lucky he was inside and not me because I would've cancelled the whole order.   After 45 minutes he comes out with our meal. We drive the 2.5 miles home and the food is all (drumroll please) COLD. What a waste of time and money. THIS is what people have been saying I've been missing out on?!?! No thanks.   Public Service Announcement: unless Waffle Houses are partnering with Sallie Mae to forgive student loans, you won't find me in one or ordering from one again. While I know each location is different, nothing about this experience made me want to try the franchise again."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast this morning. The food was good...not great. The service was good. It was so humid in the restaurant, the booth seats were wet. I had them turn the air conditioning back on and soon all was well."}
{"text":"Just had my first experience at this location today with my mother and it was great.  The food was fresh and delicious.  The waitress was very nice and kind. I plan to return here in the future."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Waffle House. Come here for their waffles and everything else on the menu. My favorites include the raisin toast with apple butter spread, grits, the eggs, bacon, sausage and not to forget their famous hashbrowns. Scattered, smothered and covered is my favorite way to go. Bert's chili is also great too! This is a great place to go 24/7. The place is a bit tight but I prefer this over Dennys anyday. I wish there was WH in California but these are abundant in Arizona and all over the south. Not so much in Texas though."}
{"text":"Considering the location I thought this would be a good breakfast place. Sadly I was mistake. The Restaurant smells dirty. There hole staff is ghetto and trash. They have employs wearing street cloths were our food was being cooked. No one was wearing hair net's and some employs were not even wearing gloves wall handeling food. All employees were loudly talking about drinking, partying, and other inappropriate things.  The food it's self was alright for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I miss going to the waffle house and this one was closest to home so i went in and was mostly excited about the waffles. Sad to say that the waffle was kind of cold but still tasty. Beside that the service was great and my meal was great. Refills were prompt and you usually dont get that. Great place."}
{"text":"Came here after a night out drinking with my cousin and her best friend. This location had the best service that I've ever experienced at waffle house. Right off the bat we were greeted upon walkin in.   Madea, was our amazing cook for the night. She freakin made our food with passion. She was considerate enough to ask my cousin if she wanted bacon that was more lean or more fatty. Or in her words \"you want blacknpeople bacon or white people bacon?\"  Hahaha. at that moment, I knew she was about to throw down.  I tried their new cheese steak bowl & asked them to hook me up & make the bowl \"all the way\" style. That bowl was so huge & literally was bomb.com  Madea had a little bit of difficulty with the pans she was using to fry up some eggs. They weren't turning out the way she wanted to because they kept sticking. When she brought the food to our table, she had apologized and felt the need to redeem herself to let us know she could cook and it was the pans fault since my cousin and her friend asked for over easy cooked eggs. She went back to cook some eggs for them to make up for the broken egg yolks & kept giving us a plate of 2 cooked eggs. Finally after the 3rd attempt she got it down!   She takes great pride in her cooking. Our waitress for the night was friendly as well. She made great conversation. Made us feel comfortable and provided the best service as a waitress should. Unfortunately, we did not catch her name."}
{"text":"My first time here , heard a lot of hype about this place , food was good , customer service was good , still would like to try a few others to get a true feel  for the franchise and the food ! Overall I give them a thumps up , good prices as well if you have not tried it ? I would say go for it !"}
{"text":"The Waffle House totally exceeded my expectations. I thought it'd be just another crappy Denny /IHOP like spinoff, but the food here was actually really good. I'd even go far enough to say it was the best waffle I've ever had. Plus, it's dirt cheap. The decor of this restaurant is classic late night dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to two Waffle Houses.  Both had great service, and the food was fine.  Tons of it for cheap, which makes me question the quality.  But, in the end, it's a waffle with chocolate chips, so I won't be too concerned about health.  Easy parking, nice people working."}
{"text":"This experience at Waffle House was wonderful! The staff was very attentive to our needs and made it a very enjoyable meal. Our waiter, Redrick constantly served us and made sure we had everything that we wanted!"}
{"text":"I have only visited this location one time with a date. We decided to order breakfast foods. When we walked in we were not greeted. This was my first and only visit to a Waffle House, so I had no idea what to expect. We eventually got seated, and waited. The tables were dirty and the employees acted like they were bothered that they had to serve customers. The food was the best thing about the visit, and it was not even that great in my personal opinion. Will I return to this location? Never, ever, again."}
{"text":"Go here if you want to smell like your greasy meal afterwards for three days!!! Don't dare wear a cute little outfit because you'll smell like sausage, deep fry grease, and stale coffee forever. The aroma infuses into the fibers of your clothes! I had to take a shower immediately after because my hair smelled like so much grease.   I took my jacket off and left my room and came back to the whole hotel room smelling like Waffle House, but not in a good maple syrup warmth way."}
{"text":"Not much going on with their menu. Little in the way of options. I had the Texas bacon egg and cheese melt. Nothing to write home about. The waffles were lame. The waitress was friendly but never came back to offer more coffee. Oh and the tables were small and cramped."}
{"text":"Dirty! Unsanitary environment. Bugs on the floor , dirty cups and plates. . I looked at my food and saw what they were doing and I just wanted to barf. The cook was using dirty gloves to handle the food and cleaning things off the floor. I spent 30 dollars for two people. I could have went to chili's or Olive Garden. Idk it was such a waste of food and money. Im never going back everrrrrrr! I never right reviews so you know this review is serious. Guys do yourself a favor and have some dignity."}
{"text":"Don't ever waste your time here!!  Walked in sat & waited 10 mins no one greeted no coffee nothing. It was Sunday morning 8:30 and not busy. The place was dirty floor was sticky and tables not clean. We left as we arrived receiving nothing not even a greeting or water. I spoke with the manager who along with other staff were all having a social hour among themselves and she seemed indifferent and care less that we were walking out. As we departed the were laughing and happy to not work. All should be fired and establishment closed. Encourage health inspector check this horrible place out!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always good but this time in I had a rude ass waitress. I was expecting a wait since it's New Years Day but I never expect or appreciate the attitude. I didn't make you get this job or come in today ma'am. Just take my order and make sure it's right with that attitude or I will shut this one down and make everything stop moving until it's right. #FoodJones"}
{"text":"There were so many things that went wrong...U thought we were on camera and someone would say \"You've been punked!\" But, no, it was real-all too real!  For starters, we were told it would be a 10 minute wait just to clean an area table for us.  10 minutes for cleaning-I really should have walked out the door at that point but no I waited with my mother.  We sat at the booth and I immediately felt something wrong when another customer-a seat away from me complaining about her grits they looked like mashed potatoes instead of grits.   Our waitress asked what we would like to drink and I said we both like coffee and water she only brings one coffee and water she forgets to bring cream for our coffee's and forgets to give us silverware we had to wait about 10 minutes in trying to get her attention.  She gets our breakfast order mixed up, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a coffee refill and when she asked how's was our breakfast-I told her our bacon was overcooked, burnt really.  She didn't offer to get us another one-she just said-Oh, sorry about that.  Our waitress was either pre-occupied about her boyfriend or just started working and wasn't trained well or just really didn't care about customers.  Almost forgot, another waitress sat down next to me saying she was so hungry and finally had a chance to eat when she finished she didn't even clean her area and our waitress used a dirty rag to clean only the area next to it.  Needless to say-our waitress' mind was somewhere in LaLaLand.  Will not patronize Waffle House Tempe-(University &101)."}
{"text":"No coffee...what? Sat for 10 minuets before getting waited on, and I am the only customer in the restaurant. Had to repeat my order 3 times. I didn't expect 5 star resort quality food and service, but hoped for a 2...nope!"}
{"text":"\"Better half\" and I have wanted to try this place for the past two decades and we finally did!  We should have done it sooner.  Mama Jude, our waitress, was very personable and helpful.  We had waffles, eggs and bacon. Asked for crispy bacon and got it.  Butter was nice and spreadable.  I tried the pecan waffles and can say they do not disappoint.  We also bought a couple of mugs -- $3.00 each!  There is an old diner feel about this place.  We were told the owner comes in on weekends to expedite orders.  They cook in front of everyone so it was kind of cool to see.  This place is very clean.  Glad we finally went!  When we're back in Phoenix, we will go back to try lunch.  They opened in 1973!  Impressive.."}
{"text":"Always great food and even better service. The cheese grits and biscuits with sausage gravy are yummy and their burgers and waffles can't be beat. Plus, the price is ALWAYS right!! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Arelia I believe was the girls name,  she was me and my boyfriends waitress tonight. We are about 20 and the people behind us were about 40, she WOULDNT acknowledge us for anything. She was determined to please the couple more then she was us. We ordered with her, then waited. She then proceeded to forget the pecan waffle, and never noticed she forgot to bring it until we had to inform her. Then lastly she never apologized for talking to the couple FOREVER BEHIND US while I saw our food waiting. This woman also was rude to other employees by saying \"shut up!\". She needs customer service updates for sure. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, fast.  Cannot have any complaints about this place.  Food made to order and you can watch the action.  Good price and fresh."}
{"text":"Not fancy, good good quickly. Great value. Good service. Good Waffle House experience."}
{"text":"went here about 2am after working a late night call case . ignored for a while . just left . short staffing and bad attitudes!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to stop in for a quick breakfast... Everything was just as a Waffle House normally is, but a few things put this one over the top for me...  The sanitation grade was recent and a 98.5... Solid and I like it...  My boyfriend got the grilled chicken breakfast combo thing (I think it was grits and eggs with a piece of grilled chicken... It's been about two weeks, I should write these sooner...) and that was some of the best grilled chicken I've ever had... It was fabulous...  My food was good, too, but I definitely had chicken envy...   We were frequently checked on and any requests we had were handled promptly..."}
{"text":"Let me start the review off by saying I've been to waffle houses across the country and have had nothing but great experiences.  When I heard that my girlfriend had not been to one I knew I had to take her to one!   Waitress sucked she was the only one with out a name tag. She was very rude. Tried to take our order immediately, and when we said we weren't ready she gave us a very rude look. Didn't give us our 5 min check in to ask how everything was.  Other than the terrible service from the old Latina waitress with the ribbon tattooed on her arm, the experience was good. I mean the food was good."}
{"text":"I am always pleased with Waffle House. Granted a lot of people think their food isn't that good but ever since I discovered them on a nationwide road trip a couple of years ago, I have been nothing but pleased. They don't exist where I'm from. I enjoy getting a good hearty breakfast for a good price. This location being near hotels and the airport, found it pretty busy on a Saturday morning. We were seated about 10 minutes later and enjoyed good service. Nothing fancy here, just people working their job getting you your food. Thoroughly enjoyed my Texas melts with hash browns covered in gravy. My dad enjoyed his eggs and sausage with a waffle on the side. He was pleased he could get chocolate chips over the waffle! He had never been to Waffle House before but he enjoyed the price, that's for sure. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"The best hash browns I have every had.   Fun waiters and cooks. Food is very reasonable. It is a must try."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Waffle House. Great food. They're gravy and biscuits are wonderful along with their steak patty melt."}
{"text":"Love the food and everything. I choose Waffle House over many breakfast places not only because of great food (nothing like their franchise places), but also excellent prices."}
{"text":"Restaurant was dirty; trash cans over flowing, dusty counters, floors covered with grease.   My eggs were raw and strawberries on waffle old."}
{"text":"I don't know how any Waffle House can be less than 5 stars. You are in and out of there in 30 minutes and stuffed with a cheap delicious breakfast. The wait is always quick. The staff is usually friendly. Sometimes it's doesn't appear the cleanest.. I mean with napkins on the floor.. but that's kind of just a typical diner vibe. Waffle House continues to be favorite place to stop in the south!"}
{"text":"Hit n Miss,,, and this one should have Missed....   Country Ham, definitely left tout too long, and was not very good,, only had 2 bites out of it and determined NO WAY.. Waitress never questioned why I didnt finish it, oh well.. Not saying done on purpose, but none the less, will never be back at this location.   For a Waffle house, they may not be the cleanliest, but they are usually great food at a fraction of the costs.. love these places on road trips !!"}
{"text":"For a waffle house this place is a little better than the others,, Staff is exceptional, and the place is always VERY Clean.... Awesome job..."}
{"text":"I think our servers name was Venus.  First off she was amazing,  she even helped my daughter with a marker to draw and it was very appreciated.  The food was delicious.  I am soooooo impressed! thank you for a wonderful breakfast"}
{"text":"Yes !  A Waffle House in Phoenix that has service . . . and mighty fine Waffle House food."}
{"text":"Waffle House . . . food is good - consistant and good.  Cook was awesome, she was able to put a quality product out to her best.  Kudos to ' Alice ' ;)  Service was weak . . . shameful.  Only one server and he was overwhelmed.  Ok - Friday evening ( 8 pm ish ) and I can understand trying to cut corners on expenses by letting a server go but NEVER cut corners where it counts.  Service is one area that will break a restaurant or more important bring people back.  ( food of course is the other )   One server was unable to get the orders correct, product out to the customers nor clean up.  Given that the cook was doing her job . . . the person taking / putting in and delivery of said orders was the weak link here.  He was overwhelmed with having the entire floor to himself.  I will not go back to this Waffle House again.  Sorry, the management is to blame and since they don't care, why should I return."}
{"text":"I had never been to Waffle House before today and I was pleasantly surprised. It may not be asthetically pleasing and pretty sure one the patrons who looked like a Waffle House regular farted right next to us, but the food and the service was pretty good! It's a very cheap and quick place to get some good eats and they have a variety of tasty breakfast options. Definitely give this place a try at least once!"}
{"text":"Ok, props.   When I walked into this place I thought oh man... this is a dump. But I learned, as always, to never judge a book solely by its cover.   Limited seating... so we had to sit at the \"bar\". Order was taken in relatively quick time... considering the place looked slammed - despite being small in size.   What is cool is all the food tastes very fantastic and home cooked. The grits were an A. The eggs, over easy, were real eggs and not a powdered mixture. The Waffle while not some Belgium work of art... was simplistic and tasted great. Everything just tasted like a good, home cooked meal.   The staff, upon closer watch wasn't frantic, they were highly organized and accommodating - the hostess checked on us 3-4 times during our meal and seemed to be the main organizer as well as worker (bouncing to and from various stations)  Very pleased. Anyone who knows my ratings I only give out 5s to the best of the best. I can't give this Waffle House that rating, bc I've been at some really amazing breakfast places (Booshie) but for the buck, this place has quite a bang."}
{"text":"Cheap, easy menu, add cheese to just about anything they serve. Clean, small, fast service and grits! Love it."}
{"text":"I liked the Waffle House in Fort Smith, Arkansas when I stopped there for breakfast a few years ago, so I thought I'd introduce my family to this southern mainstay. My egg and cheese omlette was good (nice and fluffy eggs), but my wife said the meat in her patty melt tasted like it was old. I agreed. The servers were as nice as could be. Don't expect to be able to sit with more than 4 people at a table (only one table can seat four, and the rest seat only two).  I thought the fact that they mopped the tile floors right next to us when we ate our lunch \"quaint\", but my wife wasn't so pleased."}
{"text":"First time coming in with my husband and we both agreed it was worth a shot. The minute we walked in, it was pretty empty and my husband and I waited by the door. I assumed it would be like other restaurants to wait to get seated. And I was wrong. We waited 20 minutes before a worker finally acknowledged us. Keep in mind, it was pretty empty in there with 5 workers just walking around. He let us know we can sit anywhere. At that point my husband was irritated and we just left. Service was not great. Never coming back."}
{"text":"So, just for some context, my family and I have a Waffle House tradition.  We are from New England, which is entirely void of these places.  So, when we travel, if there is a Waffle House in the area, we always go.  When comparing these places I bench mark them to 2 of them that I have been to against all others.  These 2 were in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and had the friendliest most respectful staff.  The food across all of them is pretty consistent, with mediocre waffles and great hash browns cooked with the additions that you want.  This place was just plain depressing.  I walk in and sit down.  Nobody says a word for me for about 10 minutes, although it was not crowded at all.  Finally my waitress, without even looking at me, say, \"Here or takeout?\".  This began a meal where most of the staff never made eye contact, never smiled, never asked how me or my meal was.  I thought I was in an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Finally, there was a waitress who was smiling and friendly.  As it turned out, she was in from another store.  Many Waffle Houses see it as part of there \"thing\" to be friendly.  Many even have a practice where whenever some enters the whole staff say good morning in unison.  this one, not so much.  I have to say, that when you have an individual like this it is an individual staff issue.  When you have an entire store like this, then it is certainly the management.    For my part, I will just chalk this up as another part of the quaintness of my ongoing Waffle House tradition.  But if Waffle House corporate reads these, this is probably something that is easily correctable."}
{"text":"Food is good about 85% of the time but the waitresseses are always too busy talking to one another to take care of their customers. I've constantly heard very inappropriate conversations taking place in front of other customers."}
{"text":"Waffle Houses are bomb but this one is my favorite.  Not only is it 24 hours but it is super clean and well lit.  There are totally some seedy people who go here but their conversations just make for very interesting background noise.    As far as the food, the prices are cheap, the menu is semi-a-la-carte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect.  This is THE Waffle House to visit.  Go now, do it.  How good does a waffle sound right now anyways?  That's right, Pretty Damn Good."}
{"text":"We stopped by Waffle House for a little breakfast on the go! My brother and I ordered the \"All Star breakfast\" which comes with grits or hash browns, bacon or sausages, toast, eggs, and a waffle.  The breakfast was good, but my grits were lukewarm!  Our servers name was Barbie and she was a serious cookie! She was patient when taking our order but she was serious about getting exactly what we wanted.    The cook was a heavy set woman who barked out commands as if to say \"this is my kitchen, move out my way!\" She wore only one glove on her left hand but prepared food with both; did they run out of gloves?   The restaurant was clean, and some of the people greeted us with a smile and a good morning while others just looked on!   Well after about seven minutes our to-go order was ready but it didn't add up for me so I asked Barbie why was it so much, and after charging my card she told me that in addition to the extras like cheese and pecans in one waffle, a $2.50 gratuity was added as well as a $2.05 take out charge on top of the tax. Why was a gratuity charged for two people? And when When did they start nickel and dime-ing customers?"}
{"text":"I just spent an hour of my very busy Saturday at waffle house! The first 10 minutes was spent standing next to the window waiting to be seated, then finally we were seated at the counter at two seats that had been available the entire time! Upon sitting down we waited another 10 minutes for someone to to come over and handed us a menu. We knew what we wanted so when the waitress Terri walked past us for the fourth time after about 10 minutes we stopped Her and asked it we could order. We knew what we wanted so we ordered the All Star breakfast. The food finally came to the table after 26 minutes! That is unacceptable!  On the bright side of things the food was good, but the waffle was cold and I had to take it home to heat it up!   I know Saturday's can be hectic for a breakfast spot so I will give them another chance! Stand by for my next Waffle House review!"}
{"text":"I like waffle house -waffles- and only the waffles, I have not tried anything else from this time tested establishment. Unless, the coffee counts, in that regard, i would strongly suggest they add more coffee and less water, a stronger brew for a hard worker. Although it could just be the brand of coffee, hmmm?. On to the waffles, they are like biting into a rainbow, for me at least, there is something so yummy about those chain waffles. Oh, I only order to go, fyi. Miau."}
{"text":"Always a  must for breakfast whenever I leave California, this place always hits the spot. Wish we had one back home. Hash browns with grilled onions, chopped ham topped with gravey and a waffle"}
{"text":"First timer at the Waffle House...everybody was super friendly! But I'm not going to be rushing back for the food anytime soon. The waffle was decent, but I would rather just go to iHOP or something."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend who really wanted to try his out.  Service was decent. The people were friendly. We had to wait to get someone's attention to pay the check but no biggie.  We ordered the all-star breakfast special and 2 eggs sunny side up with hash brown and a biscuit. Also a hot cocoa with whipped cream.  My boyfriend loved everything. I only ate the biscuit and dipped it in the egg some. This is because the food was so greasy. I eat healthy and my boyfriend doesn't care, hence the difference in opinions on the food :)"}
{"text":"We arrived at this location anticipating a delicious, quiet lunch. We were the only people eating. After the waitress took our order multiple times (she just couldn't understand what a grilled ham and cheese is.) After a bit, a few other employees meander in to hang out. They reak of cigarette and marijuana smoke. They're extremely loud, yelling, calling people \"Cracker.\" We got our food, the bacon was burnt to a crisp, the waffle took forever. The bathroom was utterly filthy. We used to love coming here right after flying in but we will be looking for a new spot"}
{"text":"I have a sentimental spot in my heart for Waffle House. Reminds me of my college days. I always like to ask the servers if any rock stars or athletes have been arrested at their location. And who doesn't love their pecan waffles? This location, with an uncharacteristically upscale brick façade, looks promising from the exterior. Plus, it's right off the 101. Once inside, it's a very typical Waffle House, which is actually a good thing if you're like me and willing to embrace the entire Waffle House experience. Seating is cramped and there can be issues if you have more than four people in your party (typical Waffle House). There is also a less than welcoming sign restricting the use of booths to parties of two or more (also typical of Waffle House). But to quote another reviewer, \"This is the place to go if you want to be ignored\" (not typical of Waffle House).  Actually, it's not quite as simple as just being ignored. I recently visited this location twice in quick succession. One visit, at an off peak evening time, was pleasant. Didn't feel crowded or rushed. Service was friendly and reasonably attentive. Only downside? The young server had no knowledge of celebrity arrests. Oh well. The second visit, during a peak weekday morning time, was thoroughly unpleasant. Flying insects!!! Dirty counters and tables. Begging required for coffee refills?!? Had to wait for the check. Then felt pushed out the door. Greeted by police arresting someone (not a celebrity) in the small parking lot. Hmm.  The food is fine. Solid Waffle House. The service? Very inconsistent. Folks next to me at the counter during the morning visit were offered whip cream, coffee refills... but I had my food shoved at me and never saw my waitress again. Perhaps that can be forgiven. We all have busy times or bad days. Flying insects? Sticky tables? Being pushed out the door? A broken booth in serious need of repair, apparently for quite some time if the sign posted is an indication? Those issues, especially those involving cleanliness, are not specific to one person and cannot be so easily dismissed. I would never return here in the morning, but I might stop by again at an off peak time when they've had time to clean the restaurant and swat flies before I arrive. Waffle House is always more fun at night in my experience and they serve the pecan waffles any time."}
{"text":"I luh me sum waffle house. Funkin hashbrowns.. smothered n covered.. throw two eggs over medium and some tabasco sauce on that bitch. chop it all up real good and use your toast as a spoon! Ham on the side.. Speaking of HAM.. Waffle House go hard as a motherfucker."}
{"text":"Always friendly, great food. Need to work on cleaning - air vents and bathrooms. They focus more on the area behind the counter."}
{"text":"I went a while back. Waitress was a complete jerk. They messed up on my bill. I asked about it and she was completely unprofessional. And argued with me when I refused to tip."}
{"text":"Food is fair, atmosphere is fair. My complaint comes in the pricing department. They used to be very well priced for what was offered. However over the past few years their prices have become higher than those of the higher end breakfast restaurants. What used to cost me and my wife 12-13 dollars now costs 26-27 dollars. At those prices I have chosen to take my business elsewhere. Which is a real shame as I've been a life long Waffle House patron."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest Waffle House I have ever been to.  It was very cold in there.  We had to ask that they cut the a/c off.  This day was a gray, drizzling , April morning.  So we weren't sure why the a/c would be on.    Our service was lighting fast and our server was very friendly, but unfortunately the food was not good.  My bacon was slightly burned and very salty.  My grits were lumpy and completely tasteless. My eggs were scramble beautifully with a perfect amount of cheese on them but they were somewhat bland as well.   Now the good...  I have to say that the hot chocolate with whipped cream was amazing.  I'm certain she used whole milk and made it with care to achieve that rich delicious (perfect) flavor.  My sister and I were there for a late morning breakfast.  We were in the mood to relax, but there was a big altercation between two of the waitresses. It was loud and absolutely unavoidable!  It lasted the entire duration of our visit.   Apparently one of the waitress kept accusing the other of not working, and the other waitress was loudly telling her exactly what she had been doing and how those things have not been getting done by themselves. It was loud, embarrassing, unprofessional and it was absolutely a killer in terms of mood.  I didn't understand why this was allowed to play out where everyone could see and hear. I didn't understand why a manager or someone didn't intervene and remind both employees to discuss this privately or table the discussion for a more appropriate time.  I was completely embarrassed for both of them.    On the positive side, there is a jukebox, old fashioned look to the place and plenty of prime parking."}
{"text":"It seems hard to imagine that you can get breakfast wrong but this was some of the absolute worst food I have ever had. It was worse than a microwave meal from the grocery store. Although the staff was obviously trying to be helpful they messed up on our order."}
{"text":"I saw something online that said, \"When your Waffle House cook is outside smoking a cigarette when you pull up, your meal will probably be great!\"  Me and my buddies decided to come to Waffle House late night after Padre Murphys for St. Patricks day.  When we did pull up, turns out our eventual cook WAS outside talking with someone (not smoking).  Was that a good sign?  We should soon find out..............  We walked inside and grabbed a booth.  The booths are a little bit tight here.  4 people would not be comfortable eating at one booth.  You could sit in the booth, but there is little elbow room and the actual tables aren't that big.  When your food comes out, its a Tetris puzzle on where to put stuff to make everything fit.  Anyways...........  Our waitress was incredibly patient, funny, friendly and chipper!  I decided to go with a regular waffle, and a triple order of hashbrowns with cheese and onions.  I had a water to drink.  I like the fact that there is an open kitchen here.  You can see everything being made fresh to order.  A few minutes later, my food was ready.  Here is how it was................  Waffle-  You ARE at the \"Waffle House\".  You should probably get one, right?  Their waffles are delicious!  A little bit soft, but full of flavor.  They serve them with a nice dollop of soft butter and then you pour your own syrup on top.  Maybe not the best waffle I have ever had, but still solid and it hit the spot!    Hash Browns-  These were great!  I ordered way too many though.  Could have gone with a double order and left full.  I ordered them with cheese and onions.  They only threw one slice of cheese on mine, which was weird.  You would think with a triple order, they would coat each rectangular piece of hash browns with a slice of cheese, but they did not.  They did layer the onions really well though.  They were very tasty hash browns and I would get them again.  I enjoyed my meal, and so did my friends.  It's real close to work, and I'm not sure why I had never gone there before.  It is open 24-7 and I'm sure at some point I will be back for another tasty waffle and crispy, delicious hash browns."}
{"text":"Not the healthiest thing to eat on the road but it is tasty.  I didn't order a waffle though.  I ordered from their dollar menu (biscuit with sausage, egg whites and cheese)  Not a bad idea.  I asked for egg whites and they obliged.  The coffee was hot and good.  The service was acceptable for 4AM (friendly but not faked) Tables were clean and prices were good.  This one makes the list of a return trip the next time I'm in Charlotte (only after I hit the gym first)  The biscuits are good but very fattening..."}
{"text":"I feel that certain people have painted an unfair picture of waffle house. Whenever I go there, the waitresses are friendly and the food is good. Sure, it may be not as clean as Five Guys or something, but it is good all the same."}
{"text":"Mattie is amazing! She is so nice, friendly and full of personality. This time is was not very packed with customers but it was packed with life and guess what that was all because of Mattie! #mattie keep up the good work making people smile!   Return again today 03/29/18 and it was the same as always! Good service and good food. In fact I have been to several Waffle Houses in my day and all over the country and the food is always good, vibe is always good and service is always great. It is one of the few restaurants that you will find consistency! Hard to believe that no matter which store cooks it will taste the same but it does! I read a few of the other reviews and yes the employees do talk personal business in front of the customers but that doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"So I had never been here before and my friend is like \"um we're changing that.\" So we did. I got the all-star which came with a waffle, choice of meat, 2 eggs, toast, and hashbrowns. I got the blueberry waffle and omg was it amazing. Everything was good, but that waffle was just wow. My friend got just a plain waffle and they added it to my meal for $1 instead of charging the usual price for it. I had coffee to drink, and everything was really good. Service was quick, and the staff was kind. May not be back to this one cuz it is far, but I will find another one and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was fast, staff was very friendly and attentive to my needs. Order was cooked as ordered, fresh and so good I had to stop briefly to write this review. Now if you'll excuse me, I have my breakfast to finish"}
{"text":"Not bad service or food except when I got home. Got food poisoning from eating a texas melt. I'll never eat here again.  not worth it."}
{"text":"For some reason, every time I eat at a Waffle House, anywhere in the country, I get sick to my stomach. But I keep going back because it's cheap and delicious. This particular location the food was good and prompt and my waitress was pleasant."}
{"text":"Do I have to put any stars?? On a road trip my son was \"craving\" WH. Called to ask for a couple booths together for 7 of us arriving in 5 min. Was told we have three empty booths and 2 are together. Came in and none together. Oh well, 3 of us sat at the counter across from the table. Then table behind is opened. Moved there. About 15 min later the table behind came in, got served, food arrived. Still we had not been offered drinks or order taken. We told the waitress we were ready and she said ok. 10 min later we left. There were 5 or 6 people standing around in the office and not doing anything. Menus were sticky and when I came back from the dirty restroom, I could see the filthy kitchen. Junk all over the floor behind the counter. Glad we left and went to First Watch."}
{"text":"We were on our way to Wilmington and needed some breakfast.  Ahoy, Waffle House!  This place is consistent.  I know that I can get a veggie and cheese omelet with hash browns peppered and covered.  And, this time, they offered a jalapeño and cheddar biscuit, which was a nice twist on the usual.  My husband loved his waffles and eggs.  Service is graciously attentive. As much as I enjoy new and different experiences, predictability is welcomed.  Thank you, Waffle House!"}
{"text":"We arrived with 14 people and were greeted with smiles and treated very well even though the workload was enormous for this small Waffle House staff.  The service was excellent.  Good Job!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed eating here today. My server (Monica) was very polite and food was great."}
{"text":"I am kinda a Waffle House connoisseur when I travel to N Carolina I really wish I could get one near me in California. Best breakfast going at super reasonable prices. Always friendly and clean, my favorite is 2 pork chops and eggs with hash browns and toast, today I saw a waitress having the same with grilled onions on top. I just had to have, and they did not disappoint. Forever a fan of Waffle House"}
{"text":"The waffle was mediocre, not crispy at all. The coffee was colored water. Over price for what we had. There is definitely better places to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Took the kids here this morning 7/28/17. It is a bit smaller than other waffle houses I have been to but the service was great! Shout out to Lauren, our server. Very friendly and attentive. In fact, I noticed all the employees were the same. But Lauren was our server and she was AWESOME! The food was pretty good. My very picky kids ate everything they ordered. Biscuits and gravy, hash browns and bacon. All devoured within a short amount of time. I would categorize this place as a dive, but a very good dive with food and service. I noticed all the people here were there to eat good food at a good price with no care in the world as to how they were dressed or looked and all were treated with great customer service from what I saw. Remember, it is a small place so I saw alot of interactions with the servers and guests. I loved the place, atmosphere and all. Remember, Dive, not a place to dress up and impress but to enjoy the food, service and peace. At least that is what I experienced at this place on this date and time. I hope that if you do try this place you experience the same."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. To be honest, when they were remodeling Waffle House I was so devastated. Just glad they are back. The inside looks amazing. Food was fast, servers were nice, and food taste amazing. I eat here probably once a week and will keep coming back here like FOREVER!!!!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT food! I ordered the shizham it was SO GOOD!! Boo was the best waitress Ever! My kids loved this food also and the baby loved to look around and watch Everything going on! Next time we are out this was we will be back here and sit in Boos section!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service for a dive chain. I love getting my hashbrowns topped and chunked (onions and ham). The bacon, egg and cheese melt was delicious and cheap. So worth the stop."}
{"text":"It's a waffle house.  It's a chain. This one was pretty acceptable.  Open kitchen, polite staff, clean, easy to read menus.  Not a bad place for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Still the best late night eatery. Close to home and easy to pick up on the way. This still have the best hash browns no matter the time of day."}
{"text":"I came here for the waffles. I also had a fried egg (over easy) and some bacon. The hot cocoa is pretty tasty as well.  They do offer the option of adding some chopped pecans on top of your freshly cooked waffles. Not Belgian waffles, but hey they stacked two on top of each other and I was happy.   The 24 hour Waffle house is a great way to end the night after going out with friends who wanted to bar hop."}
{"text":"I love Waffle House but I prefer the Independence location. At this location the staff isn't as friendly as I'm used to at ANY Waffle House.   I ordered the chopped steak party melt and opened it to put mayo on it and there was a piece of hair.   My last time here."}
{"text":"My favorite Waffle House. The morning crew is the best. Don't forget to ask for the 2016 which has great coupons.   My food is always good and if there's something wrong they're quick to correct it."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever in a Waffle House. I never had the urge to come here. My husband said \"we should try it out, everyone says it's good\"... I gave in and I'm glad I did!!! I loved that they cook in front of you. We went on a Busy Sunday. The wait was only 10 min. And they served me coffee (which was great) while waiting. All the servers had wonderful attitudes. They were funny and very accommodating.  Yes it was small and they could work a little more on the floor cleaning,  but it's a dated location. The tables, chairs and booths were clean. The food on the other hand was FANTASTIC!  My husband and I orders the country ham with eggs!!! The slice of ham was the size of the plate! The waffles taste like cake with syrup! I was in a breakfast heaven lol .. We will definitely come back for breakfast! !!"}
{"text":"Waffle and T Bone steak in Waffle House ? Hell yeah..  Anthony Bourdain & Sean Brock eat it and they are happy so do I. But honestly all the staff here that make my day, they are really friendly. My favorite one is Tamme , she is awesome I  her."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I was not particularly thrilled to go, but my friend wanted to go. I've heard good things about this place; however, I did not feel like my experience was a good one. The place didn't feel clean, although it had an \"A\" rating--posted six months ago. Their menu is very limited. They only had three different kinds of waffles--isn't their name \"Waffle\" House? Had the breakfast sandwich--definitely not anything to write home about. Server was very friendly, but I will not be back--to any location."}
{"text":"The food is standard Waffle House food. Tastes good.  BUT, the service is horrible!  The emoyees were arguing about who asked for what in front of customers.  The kid cooking did nothing but complain and threaten to walk out.  If there was someone in charge, they must be oblivious.  Absolute miserable dining experience.   Stopped in because Waffle House is usually consistent.  My mistake.  And as I write this, one of the waitresses showed her coworkers a burned Waffle and said \"you can't please everyone all the time\".  Here's a novel idea.  Try."}
{"text":"I love the Waffle House!  Been getting their breakfast bowls for a while, actually going to get one right now!  Friendly atmosphere, very clean, and most importantly wonderful food.  I love to visit this venue every time I'm in town.  After a week's stay, I find myself patron to this venue every day.  Just come on down!"}
{"text":"Had the bacon wrap nothing to write home about but I did get a MUG :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast for cheap prices, fast and efficient service and it's a mile from my house.  What's not to like?  I especially like the \"All Star Special\" which includes 2 eggs, waffle, toast, hashbrowns or grits and sasauge or bacon all for about $7.60.  It's good greasy food here.  This place is pretty tiny but I've usually been able to find a table even on the weekends for breakfast.  If you want healthy I would try Good Egg though.  Not the best healthy options here, but otherwise tasty cheap food."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Waffle House.  This one is next to Club Red so makes for good late night eating :)"}
{"text":"Sighhhh. I have been to other Waffle House locations, and I am the first to admit I am not a fan. Despite this, I agreed to go to Waffle House because the husband wanted to and it was 4 in the morning. I can say this will be my last trip (especially at this location). The booths were all dirty and sticky. The food came out wrong (I got a choco chip waffle....no choco chips...solution? they just out some on top. wow. The husband got covered hashbrowns....they had onions in them, he doesn't like onions....fail). In addition to being wrong, the food was absolutely disgusting. I'm not sure if it's the oil they use or that the cooktop was dirty or what, but I had a couple bites and was done. I had the biscuit egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich and the waffle. The sandwich was greasy and tasted like chemicals. The egg was overcooked. The waffle tasted terrible...also chemically....I just don't even know if this was food. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at Waffle House but we decided to head over for dinner tonight. I expected a run down, loud dirty place with mediocre food and bad service.  I couldn't have been more wrong. The service was so good we tipped our waitress AND the cook $100 each, the place was extremely clean and the food was phenomenal.  Never thought I'd say it but it's my new favorite chain breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Coming from California, I would say that this place is pretty legit. I mean the food is pretty ok. I mean it's no 4 star restaurant, but the place has great music and the service is very quick. If you are trying to go on a diet, then stay away from this place because the salad is even fattening. I also love the diversity within the restaurant and would recommend this place to who ever wants a quick meal before going to a baseball game or a long journey."}
{"text":"The thing you have to remember when you come here is, you get what you pay for. If you're expecting caviar and fine dining, this is not the place. If you're expecting a meal cooked with lots of extra love (and by love, I mean tasty grease lol), then you've come to the right place. Another thing to remember: you can't judge a book by its cover. Just because there are people in the restaurant that fit your stereotype of bad patronage, doesn't mean anything about the food that the restaurant serves. We, by the way, didn't witness any such trend in the people eating at this restaurant.  We stayed at the Victory Inn Hotel, which was literally right around the corner from the restaurant, for Dodger's spring training a few weeks ago. Over the course of the weekend (yes, we visited this place more than once!), we tried several items on the menu, each time being pleasantly surprised. The Waffles were all amazing: banana nut, buttermilk, strawberry, you can't go wrong! The Texas Cheese Steak Melt was scrumptious! The hash browns were crispy and tasty and eggs were just right. One of the times we were here during the day, we had an awesome waitress named Yankee who kept us laughing the entire time! Another good thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours, so if you're out for a night on the town and hungry when you're heading back, the Waffle House is a great place to stop. LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to Waffle Houses all over the country and they are always consistent! Great food at Great prices, you can't go wrong! I know for some people The Waffle House is not your cup of tea but I promise you; the older the location (and grill) the better the food! Mmmm, I can almost taste their Philly on Texas Toast and cheesy eggs and grits!"}
{"text":"Can't tell ya how good or bad the food is here because we never got waited on !!!  Walked in for breakfast. Place wasn't busy at all maybe 2-3 people at the counter area   No one acknowledges us, so after about 8 minutes we got up for our own menus  Set another 10-12 minutes still no one  Wow. Whoever owns this Waffle House must be real proud of their employees smh  We will never ever come back here or any other Waffle House for that matter"}
{"text":"So - I'm from Atlanta, the Home of Waffle House. It's tradition to eat here late at night after a hangover or just to hang out (back in high school). It's normal to expect long waits, foggy cups, dirty grills, Ebonics, and Auntie calling you baby. Ya know, the good ole southern hospitality.  The crew tonight really set the bar for my Waffle House experience especially at the University location. Usually, I'd prefer to eat at the location near the airport because it's cleaner and well kept. However, this night crew (Wednesday around 10:46p). They were FAST (delivered my food within 5min.), hospitable, the food was flavorful, the cups were clean - I could actually see through the cups.   I'd usually order hot water to let my utensils soak one more time and I probably could've opted out - okay maybe a little to far there. My water was refilled swiftly. I'm just impressed with my experience overall!   The Day crew is slow, unorganized, lazy, and the list of all possible negatives goes on. The only thing the Day crew has going for itself is the music selection. I'm sure the next time I write a review, the feedback will be different. For now, I want to acknowledge I did not have the traditional Waffle House experience I'm accustomed to.   Breakfast for Dinner has been one prefect ending to a wonderful evening! I will dream of Zzzzzs in peace."}
{"text":"I pulled over into this Waffle House to get out of the rain and to let some of this weekday 5 o'clock traffic die down. The entire staff was wonderful. The two waitresses that were working that night were down to earth, friendly, and extremely funny. Even if the meal wasn't good they would have made the trip inside worth it, but I had no complaints for my Texas Bacon Patty Melt w/hash browns and added onions (I literally gained two pounds while I was writing this...I can only imagine how much I gained while I actual ate this). The cook talked to my bf about sports and the other customers even got in on the conversation and it ended up that the entire place was laughing. I felt like they were part of my extended family and will definitely be back, if not for the food then for the hospitality :)"}
{"text":"The place is always full of smiling guest and staff! The Ambience and atmosphere although is joyful. I've been here a few times and i can't say I ever seen an out of order or dirty establishment. If you go the this location you won't receive bad customer service or cold food. I'd recommend this place. Mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast this day.  My only complaint is when I used the jux box I couldn't hear worth a damn. I put my money in a machine and got very little sound. I would JB been happier looking my songs up on my phone then playing it on speaker. But over all food was great I love the hash browns."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I didn't enter a Waffle House. As I parked my car and was about to walk in, I glanced at the other review. And then I looked inside where I could see dirty tables and a dirty setting on the counter. I decided that maybe I'd be happier elsewhere."}
{"text":"Extremely busy on a Sunday morning, I got in and managed to snag the last seat at the counter. But then, the counter was grubby, my waitress didn't bring me a menu or take my order for a bit, and didn't bring back my coffee. Yes, it was very busy.  Food arrived a little haphazard. Waffle first, then a few minutes later, my eggs and hash browns. And then my plate of city ham. And then somehow, a second plate of city ham. Weirdly timed, but it was very busy.  All of it was cooked properly. And the payment taking was easy enough.  Set a low expectation and you'll be pleased with the outcome."}
{"text":"This Waffle House has recently completed a remodel. It's located right off I-77 near where it crosses I-485, so it's accessible by both easily. I'm back to update my 51st review from nearly 8.5 years ago.  Inside, the place is very clean and new, but has the same layout as normal. At 7:00 AM, the staff was raucous and loud, but they seemed to be having a good time. None of the other patrons seemed to mind.  One dirty table and the spot I took at the counter needed a good wipe down. I got my waffles to go. At home, they were cooked properly, wrapped properly and had the appropriate syrup, butter and plasticware."}
{"text":"Quite busy on a Saturday morning, but there were seats available at the bar where I could see most of what was going on in the kitchen. Orders being shouted, take outs being handed over, checks being rung up and plates being dropped. All part of the experience of a relatively new Waffle House.  Surprisingly, my order was ready quite fast even though there was a lot going on. Eggs over medium with the usual amount of grease, hash browns covered (just cheese), wheat toast dry, a slice of ham and a pecan waffle. A lot of food for $10.  In and out quick is the way it's done at the Casa de Waffle."}
{"text":"Slow, slow, slow. Despite the fact that there was more crew than customers, it was slow to get our order placed and slow to get our food. About the only thing that wasn't painfully slow was paying the check at the register.  Some of the crew was sitting at the side counter while the cook was slammed with orders. He was trying but you could easily see that he was struggling with the load. He did get orders correct (or at least no one was complaining) but things were being delivered out of order or one person got their food while their dining partner was still waiting.  The restaurant was clean, our condiments tray was full enough and the food was the usual WH delicious. But I had a higher expectation for speed here since my last visit."}
{"text":"Excellent Waffle House experience with a crew that seemed to be pretty happy about being at work today though one of the customers decided to be an ass and rev his shitbox really loud for a couple of minutes. He apparently didn't like his hash browns.  Anyway, my \"all star breakfast\" was good with two over easy eggs that were a little greasy, white bread (zero nutritional value), hash browns (\"covered\") and a waffle that turned out to be a little bit overdone. Coffee seemed hard to get started because a new pot was brewing but was refilled as needed the rest of the meal.  Yep, it was a positive WH visit."}
{"text":"I have never had bad service or food here. It's extremely busy most mornings but worth the wait. Highly recommend. It's not your average Waffle House."}
{"text":"Oh why oh why did I decided to be an optimist and eat here anyway!  I feel nauseous now. The only thing that was kind of okay was the waffle, but after seeing their sanitation score 95 and after noticing that there were food particles on my coffee mug, workers coughing into their hands and then continuing to work without washing their hands and so many other disturbing things I began to regret my decision. I will never eat at any  Waffle House locations again. Don't waste your time or money unless you're just a poor country guy without a care in the world."}
{"text":"Obsessed waffle house lover  from NY Part of me thinks its the only reason i visit LOL   Longggg wait but wow was it amazing  Hot perfect waffle!  Country ham w a little crusp so salty good   Ans hash browns were amazinggggg  Only time i wish i lived in NC  My -1 is the tall guy. Wash your hands after you touch dirty money, or your hair. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Good hearty breakfast at a very reasonable price ant the waffles are always great."}
{"text":"Phoenix is not exactly what you would call a 24 hour town, unlike its desert cousin to the northwest.  So late night dining options are somewhat limited.    Today I went searching for a place to eat breakfast at 3am on a Tuesday.   Being somewhat of a Denny's hater, I thought I'd give Waffle House a shot, since it was the next closest option.    I have eaten at Waffle House once before in Missouri, while my girlfriend and I were on a Route 66 road trip.  Waffle Houses are *everywhere* in the south.  Don't really remember much about that meal, but this morning's is fresh on my mind.  I ordered a waffle with a side of bacon, and a cup of coffee.  To summarize, it was a disappointment.  The coffee was the best part of the meal.    The waffle was a bit overdone, thin, and just looked plain sorry.  The waffles at the Best Western complimentary breakfast beat the pants off this one.  The \"butter\" wasn't butter, it was some gawd-awful corn oil based \"spread\" with an unnaturally dark yellow color.  Ick.  I didn't ask if they had real butter because I didn't want to seem like a pain in the ass.   The bacon was edible, but the three strips looked somewhat unnatural, like it was some bacon substitute.    The staff was cool, and I don't think it's fair to blame them for the quality of the food.  At almost $8 for the meal however, this was enough to drive me back into the arms of my old nemesis -- Denny's.     Makes me wish there was an Old Brass Rail nearby that was open 24/7.  Maybe I need to move to Vegas if I want to continue living this vampire lifestyle."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating breakfast here and it wasn't all that.  I paid  $25.00 (includes $5 tip)  and a guest to eat breakfast.  I had cheesy eggs, hash browns, raisin toast, bacon and coffee.  He had 1 waffle, bacon, eggs, hash browns and biscuit.  The food was unseasoned and the coffee pot looked gross. When I mentioned that to the waitress, she said the inside was clean and ran her finger along the inside to show me her finger??? Most of the tables were dirty, and I waited until one was cleaned for us. Also, I'm a BIG woman and had to squeeze into their booth table.  So, if you're heavyset, I highly recommend that you sit at the counter.  I left feeling full, but unsatisfied.  Wish I had followed my first mind and went to IHOP's. Or, better yet, cooked my own breakfast at home but I was \"paying it forward\" by treating someone who needed a \"real\" meal and not McDonald's dollar menu."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Waffle House but I enjoyed it.  The inside is not fancy.  In fact, most Denny's and IHOPs are nicer.  However, the service was good and the food was good.  Waffles were not crispy enough on the outside, but hash browns were very good and toast was good."}
{"text":"Breakfast Friday. Had the All Star. Eggs, bacon, hash browns, and a waffle. Yum. I don't know what they put in their waffles but they are as addicting as drugs. So good.  The place is busy, noisy, and not exactly sparkling clean, but the service is prompt and friendly, the food (breakfast) is really good, and prices are very reasonable.  So why not?"}
{"text":"Old reliable if you will. I am pretty boring, get the same thing every time, sausage & egg sandwhich. Great place for consistancy and to be able to actually chill out, drink coffee, read the paper, make convo, etc. Staff are always friendly and helpful. It's my go to but I try not to make a habit of it."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast the other day with my boyfriend and were seated immediately. We were also greeted by our server quickly and we ordered. He got a triple hash brown with ham and mushrooms. I got a waffle with bacon. It took about 10 min at most to get our food. If that! When we got our food everything tasted amazing. Server was there if we needed anything and overall amazing service."}
{"text":"First time here...exceeded expectations. No waiting, which was a surprise. Lots of hustle by everyone here...our waitress Deanna always had a smile, she was courteous and social even while on the run.  Food was fantastic, large portion, MUST have a waffle!! Will be back and seek out other Waffle Houses...the bar will be high to beat!!"}
{"text":"Whoever the new owner of this branch just lost a business. We used to frequent here for the all-you-can-eat promo from 2-9pm 24/7 but with the new management and staff, nah. Meh."}
{"text":"First time here. And it's such a popular place out here in Arizona! Their wait is not that long either for being a small diner place you do have to wait till guest are done eating so you can get a place to sit. But they're customer service is really friendly! When it came to ordering out waitress was extremely friendly. We placed our order and I was super fast to get to us! I'm impress on how our order did not take more than 10 mins. Our waiter came by a few times to make sure we were ok. everything was good. The waffles were so yummy!!! Wow super delicious. Great taste!!! Would totally go back!! I miss it already they don't make waffles in cali like they do in Arizona."}
{"text":"Cleanest Waffle House I've ever been to. The service was great and the food was quick and delish!"}
{"text":"As far as waffle houses go this was right there with the better ones. Of course it's Waffle House though, you go here to get a big down and dirty cheap breakfast. This isn't your gourmet brunch. I'd take a Detroit Coney Island breakfast over Waffle House most of the time but when I travel south I like  to visit a Waffle House, it just reminds me of those great hung over mornings when I was stationed in Florida."}
{"text":"Hmmm...not sure what to say. While sitting at the table, something seemed wrong. Smell like poop but there's no way it would. When I asked my kids if they smelled something, they said the same thing. Noticed the Trash can right by the table. It is fortunate to see 24/7 restaurant but how this place pass health inspection is a huge question. Not sure what but something is making me go bathroom couple of hours after eating there."}
{"text":"Sat next to the open kitchen, list my appetite just by looking at it. So dirty, unclean, unhygienic, how could the quality of the food be? We ordered Waffles, was flat and soft. I would not return to this location unless it's snowing in Phoenix and there is no where to go..."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm in love with breakfast its my second favorite type of meal. My grandmother owned her own small restaurant where I spent ALOT of time and learned all about making breakfast and pastries. I've spent my life in the kitchen and around food.    This location was a very poor excuse for a waffle house. The waitress wiped off the table for us to sit then asked us for out order by saying \"ya'll know what you want or you need a menu\". Why would she assume that we know the menu? Why would she assume we knew what we wanted because we sat down? The food was greasy fat laden mush. My egg had so much oil I patted it down with 5 napkins and still could taste and see the oil. I'm not one of those health nuts that doesn't eat oil or fats. No but I am aware of what goes into my body and this was unacceptable. The food was bad the service was horrendous and frankly I have given up on waffle house completely. It has consistently declined in the last 10 years. No one cares what they serve any more people do not take pride in the service they give or food that they prepare and serve. I am saddened to say I am still in search of great breakfast along with great donuts. On a Thursday at  0815 I would expect more since it was not extremely busy. Disappointed again:("}
{"text":"I mean, it's Waffle House, so you know not to expect a stellar experience going into it. Food-wise, it is one of the better locations I've been to. I've even been to this one sober! However, I have a HUGE problem with their \"hostess.\" I'm sure she means well (she's an older lady), but it is NEVER okay to touch the customers, give them unexpected massages, and initiate awkward, personal conversations. I have cringed watching her make families uncomfortable and have experienced it first-hand while there with my boyfriend and his family. I hope someone tells her to tone it down, it's extremely inappropriate and, frankly, creepy."}
{"text":"I ate here  earlier this year and every time I drive by I am reminded why I've never returned since. I typically love going to Waffle House , kinda gives me all the feels of diner style food that's  comforting , quick and filing .  This particular visit  was nothing close to that . The 2 females that were working were not friendly  and the food wasn't good at all . I seriously feel like I was food poisoned that day . My BF literally had to go to the bathroom as soon as he laid his fork done . I was dying laughing until I walked to my car and a sudden wave of sickness hit me .  The grits looked odd to me , maybe they were old I really don't know . ( why did I eat themmmmm ???) Needless to say we  arrived empty and left empty . Don't even want to see the exterior of this place . Anyways hope it was an isolated incident . Otherwise be wary of the grits!!!  Giving 2 stars since the food came out quick ."}
{"text":"First time in a Waffle house and I liked it, pretty busy place. My boyfriend told me there's better waffle houses and he was disappointed because it was my first time in a waffle house and claimed that they're mediocre. So if you're a waffle house junky this place might not be for you. But what do I  know lol."}
{"text":"Waffle houses!! What an incredible invention! My boyfriend took me here for breakfast and it was love at first BITE since then!   Let's start by saying that I so much appreciate their work hours: open 24/7!! So if you feel like having some fresh scrumptious eggs at 3 am, you can have them here.   I recommend the cheese n eggs. They are literally buttery and very cheesy scrambled eggs that will melt in your mouth. They have the choice of bacon or sausage, grits, tomatoes or hash browns, and choice of toast! Go with the raisin toast and spread some apple butter on it. You won't regret it, I promise. Can't wait to try other dishes! Although be aware that those eggs will become a chronic addiction...they're SO GOOD!!   I also like the coffee there, obviously for unlimited refills. This location in Mesa is conveniently located close to the 60 freeway and the staff is always courteous and smiley!   Waffle houses you won my heart!"}
{"text":"This was my default Waffle House.  If I think really hard I can still imagine the grease in my pores.  Mmmmmm....  Grease.....  I took my grease in the form of butter.  I like their breakfasts quite a bit.  And at the time of night/early morning we used to go, it seemed the most appropriate meal.  Their waffles are really quite good. They may not be Lo Lo's good, but they are darn fine for this kind of a place.  Better than expected.  Don't expect anything fancy, just basic stuff that was most likely all on the menu back when the place opened in 1955. (Not this location, but the company.)  My friend wanted a deeper more generous portion of grease.  Every time we came, he'd get one waffle, and a patty melt.  Every time.  And he was still thin after doing this for years.  Yea, we hated him just a little bit.  But I will say, I tried them a few times and OH my goodness they were good.    Now sure, maybe these memories were tainted by the fact that I don't think we ever went there before midnight, and it was often after 2am.  But really, I think that just enhanced it because I remember the places we got bad food at that hour OH so clearly.    Don't come looking for health food.  But if you've got an open mind, and no dietary limitations, Waffle House can definitely show you a good time.  PS - Did I mention it's cheap?"}
{"text":"Grabbed some breakfast here with the kids while on vacation at the nearby Wigwam.  So there are no Waffle House Restaurants where we live in Los Angeles and my little daughter has been begging to try one everyone time she sees one when we're out of town.  So I figured that the Waffle House is to waffles like IHOP is to pancakes.  Well that's true sort of.  They do serve a variety of waffles, but the restaurant is much smaller and it is configured where all the cooks and wait staff are behind a counter and they serve you from within this inner circle.  In any case, the place doesn't look like much, but the food (breakfast) is great and the prices are cheap.  We also enjoyed great service on our visit."}
{"text":"Pretty good Waffle House. Clean and the staff was great. As always it is nice for the kids to watch the food being prepared... nothing special about this Waffle House..."}
{"text":"As slow as service can possibly be.  Zero sense of urgency!   We sat there for over 10 minutes until I had to say something in order to get someone over to help.  Maybe because I'm white?"}
{"text":"They get pretty busy for breakfast but the wait isn't usually more than 10mins to be sat. Food is consistently awesome and the servers are upbeat and welcoming."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Food was delicious, delivered quickly and accurately.  Great service! The entire staff interacted with us. Even had some fun!  We didn't get pie...so there's room for this location to get that fifth star."}
{"text":"Sat at the counter very entertaining, a little loud though.. Fast service, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm 32 years old, lived in CA and MD my whole life, and it took a relocation to AZ for me to go to a Waffle House for the first time. Am I even American?! If I had to prove my loyalty to the Stars and Stripes by clogging up my arteries with breakfast food, then FINE!! 'Murca!!  I entered the bustling restaurant on a recent Sunday morn having no idea what to expect - I'd always imagined just a small, greasy counter with almost immediate waffles available. I've heard rumors of the Waffle House Index - apparently their fare takes so few fresh ingredients that they can open in almost any circumstance, so they have become the de facto first-line of information after local weather disasters. Rumor or not?  Eating alone, I took a seat at the counter that wraps around the kitchen in an \"L\" shape.  The cooks and staff are wearing NFL gear it being a fall Sunday and all. I order a coffee, pecan waffle (A-, good, lots of butter and syrup, but nothing to make a big deal of) and hash browns with onions and jalapeños (B-, hash browns good, but cold, canned jalapeneos just tossed and folded into the hot food confused my mouth)  Overall, an easy, quick breakfast that is a step above fast food breakfast, but still comes in 2nd to IHOP, Denny's, or any local diner you can find."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon. It was empty, so we sat down & were greeted right away. Food came out fast as well, fresh & hot. It was my boyfriend's first Waffle House experience & he's been talking about the day he can go back ever since lol   Tip: Get the Raisin bread with apple butter, watch your life change for the better!"}
{"text":"Awesome service even though the place was packed. Even more amazing was seeing the manager washing dishes and cleaning the area while allowing his people to continue to rake care of customers.   Gotta say \"hats off to you Eric Ehler\".  Really neat to see his people actually appreciate it and tell him so.  My waitress Karla was great and very attentive."}
{"text":"People have been telling me about waffle house for years. Last night I had my first experience.  The staff was very nice. The waffle that I had was awesome.  I think what surprised me most was how good their burgers were.  You are reading this correctly. I had breakfast and a burger."}
{"text":"On our way back from a night of bar hopping in Cleveland we were looking for a late night savior for drunk munchies. iHop's were all packed of course so we drove about 20 minutes outside of the city down 71 and low and behold like an angel descending from heaven we see a Waffle House sign lit up like a glowing invitation from the Gods.   So we go to pull in and we get pulled over by a sheriff out of nowhere, granted we had a sober driver so no worries, he approaches the car, asks us where we came from and where we're going and we all tell him we're starving and he was really cool and told us to enjoy our night and drove off. Shout outs to the Medina sheriff department for that one.   We made it into the Waffle House and were seated immediately, it was practically empty but there were a few customers. We ordered bacon cheeseburgers, BLT's, and waffles all together, the waitress threw the BLT's in for free! Amazing. Judging by my current state the food was a 10 but who really knows. I enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location so I'm going to give it 3 stars, though the service was really more of a 2 star rating this time.  The service was quick and polite, but how hard is to understand when somebody orders hash browns scattered all the way. If you're not into waffle house, I can see how you can be confused by the statement. If you work there, you should know scattered all the way does not mean scatter the hash browns till they are flat and cover the entire plate.  After sending it back once, it just came back as ultra scattered with nothing on top.  Not worth sending back again...just grabbed some gravy from a friend and slathered it on top."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. My hash browns were burnt and when I asked for more I got attitude from the server. The servers are very rude and not very personable. I was not please with my time here and I will not be returning. My water never got refilled and when i finally had to ask I got attitude again and got my water slammed in front of me. I'm noticing that I'm the only one getting this service from this waiter named Alex. He's nice to everyone else and not to me. I don't appreciate it."}
{"text":"First time at The Waffle House because there isn't any in So Cal. Read other reviews & was a bit weary... but decided to try it anyway.  Came for breakfast on Sunday @10:15a and it was full. We were told it was a 30min wait for a party of 5. Hostess was friendly and provided us with menus to take our order so when we got seated, they could put in our order right away.  Our waitress was Jess and she was very friendly & attentive. Our food came out about 10mins after being seated. Food was hot & waffles were very good.  Everyone was pleased with their meals.   Only reason I don't give it 5 stars, the restaurant is small & it is not good for parties of 5+. booths are tiny and restroom was a mess. That must be addressed.  The restaurant dining area was clean.  We will return because the food was hot, yummy & great/friendly service."}
{"text":"My waitress urged me to visit the adult video store across the street last time I was there, saying \"it is so cool and stuff\".  I don't think she understood how much she enhanced my dining experience at the Waffle House, because my mind was distracted from the food and on other thoughts while I chewed away at the warm, moist, buttered, syrup drenched waffle in front of me.  Sigh...  Reliable place for \"grease spoon\" type foods, especially late at night.  Hash browns, eggs, grits, waffles - all are fairly good here for what this place is all about, and it's rather affordable.  Staff is often quite nice, though cleanliness can be an issue at times.  So much better now that the smoking ban is in effect."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday afternoon around 3 PM and had a great server who was very attentive and nice, his name was Mike. Of course I ordered a waffle because it's waffle house but also had eggs, bacon, sausage, toast and hashbrowns. Everything was cooked to order and tasted delicious. Employees were incredibly courteous and the environment was spotless. I have definitely been here multiple times before and will come back over and over again. I left feeling happy and full... What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I know what most everyone thinks, Waffle House, really? But l just have to say waffles with warm syrup, mmm so good. And at 2am, even better. You can go to Lo-Lo's for a Waffle House rip off for twice the price and even more disappointing then you can imagine. But now you can have chocolate chip, blueberry, and always a favorite... pecan. Seriously I spent time trying to replicate this batter and it can be imitated but never duplicated. Plus generally, the service is excellent and friendly. The only thing that would make this better would be real butter! I took the whole family in, 8 people and we ate for under 60$. The kids loved sitting at the counter. You can order your waffle extra crispy, softer, etc. And their other breakfast items are great. They maybe one of the few diner's that can properly cook an egg to order. Probably cause it didn't sit on a plate under a heat lamp cooking further after it is done. Plus you know that your food is fresh."}
{"text":"I love waffles. I love hashbrowns.  This waffle house suuuuuucks. The service is piss poor and they can't get orders straight. I asked for cream for my growing cold coffee twice, I got the wrong order of hashbrowns and no syrup for my waffle.  Keep in mind I am super easy to please (that's what she said).   Our server kept her head buried down at the register for most of our meal.   Get it together.  Oh, just drive to the one on the 101 and University."}
{"text":"OVERALL PLEASING EXPERIENCE.   We came to the little Waffle House and we ordered almost everything off the menu..   Why I gave it 4 STARS...  PROS: * The service was great * I'm a picky waffle eater and their WAFFLES get an A+ (wish I would have went with my mother-in-laws gut and got the pecan waffle)  * Free refills on orange juice!!! * My eggs were cooked perfectly * The food came out quick  * Personal pet peeve, when you walk in and they just washed the table with a bleached rag.. I just hate the smell with food!   Would I return??? YES Recommend??? YES Air Conditioned??? YES!!!"}
{"text":"Some might go...say what 5 stars for a Waffle House, or as some southerners say....awful house. Yes, it's a 5 star review.  Today we met Sarah, or waitress extraordinaire, who has been with Waffle House off and on since 1977. She was an amazing person and an amazing waitress. As soon as we walked in the door we received a warm and friendly greeting from Sarah and a few other waitresses, but it was Sarah who was our diamond of a waitress. Sarah could have told me to get the eggs with a side of anything and I am sure it would have been fabulous. Her sincere love of her job and her knowing the Waffle House food without a second glance would be in itself a reason to come here again.  The food was hot, flavorful, it was just good, not great....but are we expecting greatness at Waffle House or just a quick meal.  Cheese eggs, crispy hash browns, raising toast and bacon. What not to like. Double Texas patty melt, with bacon and crispy hash browns.  Sweet tea and coffee with a never ending bottom, provided by that fabulousness called Sarah.   If you get to this location ask for Sarah and you will leave with a full stomach and a happy heart. She may tell you a little about herself and you will find someone without an ounce of selfishness in her being. She lives each day with happiness. That's what people in remission do. Each day is a gift."}
{"text":"Great \"Go-to\" place at 2am.  Well... You do have limited options, but I've found this waffle house to be quite enjoyable.  I also like the fact that WH hasn't changed, you know what you are getting into and what to expect.  Every now and then there are some menu tweaks, but for the most-part... it all is the same, comfort breakfast/sandwich place that I enjoy every so often.  With ample parking and fairly fast service, this is a nice place to go.  My one gripe is that it's on Independence so you will end up taking a couple U-turns to get in and out of this place due to the median."}
{"text":"Came here at 1:10 am on a Saturday night. Waited for 15 minutes without being acknowledged. Someone finally told us that they were not taking anymore orders, because they were \"out of dishes\". When we pointed out the stack of clean dishes directly in front of the register, we were told, \"Yeah, well, it will still be about 40 minutes.\" Apparently the staff at this Waffle House will only serve you when they feel like it."}
{"text":"This was the worst service and food ever. I ordered a patty melt and it had no cheese and no grilled onions. It was a dried hamburger patty. Wanted bell peppers in the hashbrowns and got jalapeños peppers. A order of eggs with grilled onions and it was fresh cut onions. The cashier did. It get the order requiring get. The cook, PJ, over cooked the eggs and the place was full of gnats. Went to get a refund the the cashier was friendly to give a full refund. Not my first choice for a late night run."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is a great place for breakfast. I never got to try any other meals here, but the grits with cheesy eggs were delicious. The prices are very cheap."}
{"text":"The usual Waffle House breakfast, but I had such a good time watching the morning crew work. They brought a smile to my face the way they cut up and get along."}
{"text":"This Waffle House location is the closest to my house. I am not originally from the South but have learned to love and appreciate the Southern staple that is Waffle House. Anyone who has been to a Waffle House knows that it's a divey breakfast experience. It has become a joke with my roommate that I ask if she would like to join me for \"brunch\" here on the weekends.   The staff at this location as well as most other Waffle Houses are full of character. However, I have never had a \"bad\" experience. Some are just friendlier and more attentive than others.   The breakfast food is great. The hashbrowns will have anyone coming back for more. I have yet to experience a waffle at Waffle House - I know, it seems like a sin. But I also opt for the bacon, egg, and cheese texas melt with hashbrowns. Food is always cooked perfectly and comes out FAST! It's also fun to use their lingo when you order your hashbrowns.   I know that people always talk about how cheap Waffle House is, but that hasn't been my experience. I can never get out of there without my bill being over $10. Which isn't too bad, but not what I would consider a cheap meal."}
{"text":"Hit up this Waffle House location after a night out with some friends. The place was pretty packed and we had to wait for a table (about 10 minutes or so). However, the service is FAST so tables will clear out pretty quickly. The staff here, as at most Waffle Houses are characters. Lots of yelling back and forth. Not always the friendliest, but they get the job done.   Is Waffle House a culinary experience? Not by any means. Is it the best food in the world at 3am? ABSOLUTELY."}
{"text":"First timers to Waffle House and we couldn't have been happier. A warm welcome and hello from several employees started this visit off in a terrific way. Lola was friendly and efficiently seated her guests - we waited just about 15 minutes on a Sunday morning in February, Valentine's Day actually. The food smells delicious here and it was. We sat at the high bar after being graciously invited forward by the head chef. Our pecan waffle was cooked to perfection and studded with pecans, warmed over with maple syrup. The hash browns were delectable - cooked crispy brown and filled/topped with our choices - ham, tomatoes, cheese... yum. We couldn't be happier with this first visit and now it won't be our last!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and what really stuck out to me was the employees. We sat at the counter and we watched while they cooked and interacted with one another. They seem to have a pretty good crew, they work together and have a routine. Our food was fast, hot and perfectly made. The cooks even occasionally turned around and asked if everything was ok which I thought was pretty cool. Our waitress Venus was very nice and took care of us. I would definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"Was there today about 1:00pm.  Seated quickly.  Took two servers to take our order, therefore the order was NOT correct.  I asked for two eggs OVER EASY with hash browns, sausage.  I was asked if I wanter toast of a biscuit, I said biscuit, \"do you want gravy on it?\"  I said yes, losts of gravy and then some more, \"there is no such thing as too much gravy\".  I was asked about adding options to the hashbrowns.  I said yes to onions and peppers, because I was shure she said green/red peppers.  I can NOT eat jalepeno peppers so if asked I would say NO to that.  I asked for extra butter from my waffle. They brought out my wife's BLT and me a plate with eggs and hashbrowns WITH jalepenos.  My wife asked about the peppers because I can't see what they are.  I was told that I ordered them, NOT!.  They took that back and brought back the eggs, by now getting cold.  My reason for ordering eggs and hashbrowns is that they get stirred together to eat.  So I had to wait for them to bring out different hashbrowns, they did with NO options included!  Still no B&G, waffle or sausage.  Next trip they brought out the sausage.  Another trip, the waffle with little butter.  Another trip they brought out the biscuit with VERY LITTLE gravy on it.  They brought more gravy, dumped on the same small plate, so it ran onto the table.  The B&G was warm, not hot, and not very good tasting.  The coffee was warm and did not taste very good. I have been to much better Waffle House'"}
{"text":"So much food!  Service was awesome.  I over-ordered big time!  I ordered some biscuits and gravy, that is completely a meal on its own!  And then I two normal burgers with some stuff in it, that was another meal easily.  Then I got a large crazy filled order of hash browns, oh man...  Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Waffles as big as your head. Literally. The waffles are big and fluffy and dynamite with some butter and syrup.  Smothered hash browns with cheese, onions, country gravy and mushrooms is the way to go  as well. The hash browns are cooked perfectly. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The toppings really just set it off and you add or minus any toppings you want on your smothered hash browns.  The kids menu has a nice selection of choices and on our visit we went with grilled cheese with hash browns. It was so good, my son wanted more.  The angus patty melt was good to. My cheese was melted perfectly and the meat cooked just right. Topped with onions and bacon, it was the way to this girls tummy alright.  Open 24 hours and staff that is ready to serve you, we will be back again."}
{"text":"Waffle House just off I-71 heading west into on Medina on Route 18 is in a perfect location.  The commercial complexes a driver sees on this stretch is vast.  That's a sure sign of high volume traffic and the ALERT goes off:  Waffle House is a sure thang.   And it is.  I stopped in the late afternoon on a Saturday for some petrol and some foodies before heading into Cleveland.  My order was standard.  Cheeseburger with home fries.  Sitting at the Waffle House diner counter I stared as the chef tossed the taters into the ring and hit the hot griddle with the sizzle of burger.  In lickety-split fashion my meal was served (lettuce tomato; mayo on the side).  No frills just fresh and hot.  Beautiful.  The staff could have spent more time chatting me up instead of staring into their mobile smart-devices but that's today's young folk.  If there was a way to rate this Waffle House at 4.75 STARS - done.  Good food for under $8.00 is great for me.  Waffle House - next time:  cheese grits with eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"When I write these reviews, I write more about the service and how I'm being treated. And I didn't appreciate how the waitress made it seems like it was my fault that I didn't eat my dried up grits. I have never experienced a time when the grits had no butter in it. That time was the first time. The butter was on the side which right away I didn't like. When I added the butter, it did not taste the same. When leaving, I packed up my food to-go but didn't pack the grits. Our waitress came over and asked if I was taking the grits. I said \"No. They're too dry and I didn't like them.\" Now, this isn't about trying to get a free meal or anything, but if I was a waitress serving someone that was not satisfied with the food, I would offer take that off the bill. Maybe management won't allow her to do that, ect., but don't try to make it like you're not at fault by saying \"Well, other people like to mix their eggs in it, or they're hash browns.\" What I take from that is \"You missed out on dried grits that COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF YOU ONLY MIXED ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT FOODS IN IT.\" That's not the point. When dining at Waffle House with My Parents, My Dad and I always share a bowl of grits. And he also didn't eat much of it because it was too dry. I was extremely mad at what she said. She could have done more to make it right, and one of them could have been to take the grits off the bill. It don't cost that much; it's not like I'd ask her to not charge us for our entire brunch. Maybe she was lazy and didn't want to recalculate the bill. Yes, she was making a suggestion but; lady, we're done and walking out of the door. It's too late to add your eggs and hash browns in a bowl of dried grits."}
{"text":"What can I say, its a Waffle House. I have spent a lot of time in these establishments while living in the south and this one in the west is the same.  If you want a good down home meal, this is a great place. No ambiance, but that is not why you go to a Waffle House."}
{"text":"To me when I think of the Waffle House breakfast is what comes to mind and of course it's always really late at night and usually always with bunch of friends.  You know that moment you been out partying or just out late doing whatever it's 1 o'clock in the morning. Your buddy's say hey let's grab something to eat, usually at night your choices are limited so it's only IHOP, Cookout, or Waffle House that's open to choose from. To me I classify this type of a restaurant as a greasy spoon dinner it's not a bad thing it's just a particular type of food you can always count on no matter what city you're in. I give it a late night thumbs up !"}
{"text":"The bloody Mary's were great, but unfortunately that was it. The food was, at the very best, barely mediocre."}
{"text":"In terms of Waffle Houses, it's pretty standard. It was clean and the service was fast. From walking in the door to leaving, we were there for about 35 mins including eating, which was awesome! The food was seasoned well. Didn't even have to add salt and pepper to my grits and eggs like I usually do. The staff was nice and the overall experience was pretty good. No complaints."}
{"text":"Where to begin! Let's start with accommodations. I would not consider taking a large party (4+) as there is insufficient room, unless you are willing to have split seating arrangements or sit in the aisle. It was quite busy when my son and I arrived about 9am. We waited in the aisle as a party of 6 or 7 were just leaving. 3 were seated in the aisle and the extra chairs needed to be removed. Once seated  (directly under the a/c vent) we were greeted nicely and provided with menus. Orange juice and water were brought out quickly after our beverage order and after perusing the menu, we decided on a cheese omelet w/chili, 2 eggs and ham with a 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy on the side. Mine came with a waffle and toast. Sounds good doesn't it? We did too! Surprise..surprise!  Absolutely devoid of any flavor! That was somewhat corrected with liberal and copious amounts of salt, pepper and Tabasco. Nothing we could do with the waffle but drown it in a pool of cold generic syrup.  The items were brought out separately? First to arrive were the 2 small thin dried out discs of ham? The rest came out  one at a time as the order was completed. We had to eat quickly with the a/c blowing directly on our food. To no avail!  We could not eat fast enough and the food taste like it came out of the fridge. My egg yolk solidified before I could eat it! My son liked his omelet w/chili though it got cold too. No wonder it was the only table open when we arrived. We actually wanted to move but nothing was available. The total for all this? Ta Da!! Only $18.85 plus tip. The only redeeming factor were the pleasant and accommodating wait staff. Our hats off to you all for having to serve this stuff with a smile!  We both wished we would have stayed home and made our own and I suggest you do the same or go to any fast food joint! (note) Stay away from the south east corner booth unless it's 110 degrees outside and/or you like your food cold! . Have a nice day all!"}
{"text":"Well...we (5) stopped in around 9:30am and all the tables were taken but had only a short wait. We ordered a little of everything... from biscuits and gravy to waffles and pork chops and omelets. All were ok though portion size was considerably smaller than I remember from our last visit. Nothing really good nor bad and service was ok too hence the 3 stars. Actually I should give give my son Jeff an extra star for picking up the tab. Thanks son! :-)"}
{"text":"OMG they had so many empty tables and they sat us at a dirty table. Then we saw ants on the table. We had to ask to get the table cleaned. The menu was small and had such a small selection. My wife was ready to leave when the waitress said, \" oh, we have this menu too.\" We toughed it out and finally ordered. Food was minimal at best. The waitress was nice, but the rest of the crew was talking so loud. Definitely not an experience I want to have again!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely not! AVOID AVOID!!!! Hair in you food. Health code violations like no other!!! Disgusting all around. Ate my food and found hair...waitress answered with well it isn't mike but could be one of the others. Took one meal off the bill instead of everything. Absolutely disgusting. Everything was burnt. Completely disgusted! Will never return"}
{"text":"The food was good. Ive always been a fan of waffle houses. We got there and it took over 5 minutes for anyone to come Waite on us. People who came in after us were even waited on before us and got there food before too. Won't go back to this waffle house again."}
{"text":"Really good food here enjoyed the eggs and toast and my friends got waffles. It's been well over 8 years since going here im due to return."}
{"text":"They don't get all 5 stars because the sweet tea was lacking on my visit.  You make this tea everyday, don't get lazy on me.  Waffle was consistently amazing as Waffle House waffles tend to be. On thé plus side, the hash browns were nice and golden this time with a good amount of crispiness, as opposed to the sometimes sogginess when they're rushing your order.  The staff here was also extra friendly in a very snarky Waffle House kind of way. Younger black guy and middle-age to older black lady who was quiet with a lot to say working the night shift were cool to chat with about NY and various topics.  Oh yeah, this location felt a lot cleaner than most also.  This is south Charlotte so that makes sense. This was a great late night stop-in."}
{"text":"I flippin love Waffle House. Would you believe that in two different cities in Georgia that I lived in there were two waffle houses across the street from each other? Seriously! Like you could go to one Waffle House and look out the window and wave to patrons in the other Waffle House across the street! In at least two cities that I know of! That is because Waffle House is not a restaurant in Georgia - it is a way of life. Like some people are catholic, I worship at the House of Waffle.   I am not sure how they do it but it is like Waffle House breeds their own waitresses. They all look the same, talk the same, have that sassy \"I don't care too much bout nothin\" attitude. Plus they now have all-you-can-eat everything between 2 and 9pm. So strap on your feed bag and get ready for a load of culture. Just make sure to get your hashbrowns scattered, smothered, chunked, peppered and covered -its divine!"}
{"text":"Hey, this place was not all that bad!  After an early trip to the airport and a stop at Mom's, DD and I wanted some breakfast.  Mom suggested 5 & Diner, but you must know by now that I really don't care for that place.  I suggested Crepe Bar or Bagel Man, but Mom didn't want to drive all over town.  So then she suggested Waffle House.  I have been to exactly one Waffle House before and it was when I was in Georgia.  I think.  Or Tennessee.  It was really not memorable.  Today I ordered the Cheesesteak Omelet.  It was actually quite good.  It came with hashbrowns that were delicious and perfectly cooked.  It also came with raisin toast (which DD promptly stole off my plate),  I was only able to finish half of the omelet, even though I was pretty darn hungry.  I washed it all down with a fountain Coke that was near perfect (a rarity these days).  DD ordered a waffle with bacon.  The first round of bacon the kitchen sent out was so badly scorched that it crumbled when she tried to pick it up.  When we asked for a replacement, it was out in seconds.  The waitress was on top of everything.  Mom ordered biscuits and gravy, which she said was decent.  But for $3, decent was a good review.  I would have liked to see a little more cleanliness in the restaurant, but I notice EVERYTHING.  For example, the Tabasco had something stuck to the bottle and the floor under the counter was caked in dust.  Everything else was pretty tidy.  I'd come here again if I had to choose between this place and 5 & Diner, but I wouldn't make it a top priority."}
{"text":"You know, this may be a huge chain, but this one works like a well oiled machine on crack.  I kid you not, the husband and I were in and out of here with full bellies in a matter of 23 minutes.  This location is certainly one of the nicer looking ones and it offers some of the best people watching ever.  Almost as good as the airport!  Service here is great; fast, efficient, and no-nonsense.  The food here is good, exactly as good as you expect from the Waffle House.  Don't come here expecting anything more refined than Denny's and you will be a happy camper like me."}
{"text":"To start things off, the food was ok and it's a good amount of food to eat. When we were leaving there was a roach on me!!  It was disgusting!! I will never eat there again even if it is free!!!"}
{"text":"I can remember visiting this location when it first opened and I was grateful for how clean and efficient the service was, but that has dwindled a bit. I came here for a quick bite after the New Year's Day rush because most of my favorite mom-n-pop places were closed! Our server was super friendly, but not the greatest hygiene. I personally think that some kitchens should have nail scrubbers available for the associates that may require some deep cleaning in regards to their nails.   The food is mediocre, but it is Waffle House classic so you get what you pay for. However, I may take a longer drive to try another Waffle House location."}
{"text":"This is a pretty clean version of the ubiquitous chain.  I've found the one off of Exit 23 in Huntersville to have friendlier service though.  Like any Waffle House you get what you order quickly so, it's a good, had too much to drink last night, breakfast spot for soaking up alcohol with grease."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service with a smile. The place is nice and clean and the food is straight up great. Nothing fancy and just perfect. Can't wait to come back soon...."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting this Waffle House(this area altogether). The workers had great customer service. The woman with the red hair was really nice from the jump, I didn't get the same from the older guy at first. I ordered my food to go and realized while on the road that a piece of my order was missing and that I had no syrup. I called but no one answered. I went back and explained to them what was missing. The older gentleman was really nice and apologetic. He remade the ENTIRE order(I was really shocked at that). The young woman(with the red hair) also apologized and gave me my food when it was done. I would definitely come back here again! I left a top the first time I ordered on top of the already included 10% fee, they deserved it!"}
{"text":"I'm on vacation here from Hawaii been here couple times Staff are very welcoming and greets you as you come in. The food was amazing since I never ate here in my life and hawaii don't even have one there. I just love the staff the are all energized and have good spirit. They all just seem to be friendly when coming in to eat even if it's takeout they just seem to love Their customers. If I was to ever visit again I sure will be stopping here again."}
{"text":"You are literally RISKING your health if you eat here.  I ate there yesterday and became  severely ill.  My stomach is still sick this morning.  I couldn't even finish the grits that had hard pieces in it that my teeth couldn't even bite threw.  The eggs and meat both had an odd odor.  I didn't even get close to finishing my plate and I still became ill.  It's not worth it!"}
{"text":"Quick breakfast food served all day. The service is great and everyone who works there is nice; as we were leaving the guy making waffles wished us a nice day. Small menu, but it has all the breakfast basics. Waffels, eggs, hashbrowns, toast, grits etc. Enjoyed this place more than ihop."}
{"text":"Walked in and walked out after a bad conversation.  To start the lil girl serving seemed to be inconvenienced by my arrival. The eye roll gave it away.  Then I began to sit in a booth beside the cooking area and found it dirty. No big deal they likely just left.  I moved to the next and found it to be littered with debris from a meal as well as rings from glasses. Enough to know it wasn't ever wiped.  I decided to move to the counter as I noticed it was clean.  The girl made a joke about musical tables. I explained that the first 2 were dirty and this looked like the only clean place in eye sight.  She disagreed by saying no comment then argued the second one wasn't dirty although it obviously was. I got a huff and another eye roll at which point I refused to let this lil girl handle my food. I figured I could go next door to spend my money, just before advising her that you don't argue with customers about cleanliness and to lose her attitude towards customers.  Surprised by this as I always have a great experience at this brand.  Lil girls trying to be grown."}
{"text":"Walked in, grabbed a booth, restaurant was empty so we got a waitress right away.  Let's just say, we didn't even last long enough to enjoy the 'sucky' food (as everyone else stated) One of the waiters was banging around dishes... We were so annoyed that we almost got up and left. Then, I saw him come closer to us with his dishes and didn't even attempt to be quiet! He was putting the coffee cups back and was literally banging them. We got up and left. If I owned that restaurant, I would not handle that kind of BS and his ass would have been fired. Save yourself the trouble and head down the road a little bit until you hit Whole Foods :) better food, better customer service."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, I can't say the same about the service and if you have more than 4 people in your party, expect to sit at seperate tables.  They brought all our food out at seperate times, so by the time one was finished, someone else was starting. Not to mention, they messed up on my dad's order.  Half way through our meal, our waitress disappeared and towards the end of our meal she was to busy talking to someone that walked in. And maybe it's just the town but from where I come from, you don't hear every main cuss word by the time you finish your meal."}
{"text":"The service is horrible at this location.  When they first open I was excited because it was a location close to my house, but have been disappointed in the lack of service.  I went into the location last yesterday and sat at the bar.  It took a while for the server to come over and when I ordered she proceeded to go to the next table vs calling in my order to the cook.  She then calls in this large group order vs my single order.  As I see the cook making the food thinking my order was in there 15 minutes later she comes confirm what I ordered.  What's the point of writing it down if you are going to ask me again? I just cancelled the order and came home to make my own breakfast.  The consistent thing about this location is bad service."}
{"text":"Remind me never to come to this location again please . I am sitting here now as we speak just because I wanted a simple bacon egg n cheese patty melt. When I came in no one spoke instead everyone in the kitchen sat and looked at me til I finally said hey everybody and kindly took a seat. As I was sitting I'm looking at all of the tables that hasn't been cleaned I finally found a end table that was clean. So as I'm sitting one of the girls yells from the kitchen hey do u know what u want ??? Ummm I acted like I didn't hear her so she could properly come to the table and take my order at this point I'm in shock. I swear if I wasn't so hungry I would have just got up and left !!! Don't let me forget to tell you how the waitress finally brings my food out and just slams it down to the table .This is ridiculous!!!"}
