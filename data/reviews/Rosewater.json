{"text":"I've been to the Rosewater for lunch, dinner, corporate events, a wedding and Winterlicious and I've never been disappointed.  The food is always good (though just shy of 5-star worthy) and there's a nice buzz in the atmosphere.  The decor is beautiful, with interesting art and furniture.  For a place owned by a large conglomerate I think they actually did a pretty good job of creating something unique decor-wise.  I get the \"garrish\" take some people have, but it doesn't strike me that way.  Service has always been top notch.  I've never thought the portions were small as some reviewers have mentioned."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for Valentine's Day.  Coldest day in Toronto for quite some time and we were seated next to a window. We were cold the entire meal.  We only ordered two drinks and two entrees.  My husband ordered the surf and turf and I had the salmon which was served with risotto and asparagus. We both really enjoyed our meals and the presentation was excellent.  Service was a bit slow.  Ambience is very nice as well.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time at Rosewater and was a little nervous as I was told by friends the place was very 'shee, she.'  We dressed up and headed downtown to the restaurant.  Easy to find and no problems parking. Our reservation was for 7pm and we were dining on the Summerlicious menu.  Our waitress approached us promptly and asked if we wanted drinks and was fully aware we were waiting for one more person without us having to tell her.  We got our drinks and I had the Elderflower Champagne Cocktail which was absolutely delicious and my friend ordered the white sangria which was also good.   It's now 7:30pm and we are still waiting for our friend.  We felt horrible but the waitress was kind and said it wasn't a big deal as they were not that busy that night.  She asked us if we wanted to order at least our appetizers while we were still waiting and we decided to (just as we had decided to our other friend arrived).  The waitress took her drink order right away (which was the red sangria that was also delicious).  My friend ordered the Passion Fruit Glazed Tiger Shrimp Asian Vegetable Slaw, Soy and Mirin Dressing and my other friend and I had ordered the Wild Mushroom Cappuccino Porcini Dust, Parmesan Crostini.  When I ordered it she advised me that it was a soup.  I had no idea...based on the description I thought it was something totally different so I appreciated the fact that she told me it was soup.  Both appetizers were delicious and just the right size. Next came the main meal which we had ordered 2 of the Steak Frites Grilled Skirt Steak, Shoe String Fries, Café de Paris butter.  I had asked for mine medium well and the waitress advised based on the type of meat it was it would end up being dry and they advised to have it cooked medium.  I was skeptical but agreed since I assumed she would know best as she who worked there.  When I got my meal there were some pieces of meat that were a little more undercooked than I would have liked but because my other friend ordered the same thing we were able to trade pieces of meat so we were both satisfied and didn't have to send the dish back.  My other friend ordered the Crisp Skinned BC Snapper Wasabi Mashed Spring Roll, Wok Fried Gai Lan, Black Sesame Tangerine Butter and there was absolutely no complaints.  She actually stopped talking to us during her meal because the Wasabi Mashed Spring Roll was apparently to die for and she was too involved in eating that to bother talking :) Dessert was 2 of the Brown Sugar Peach Crumble Fireweed Honey Ice Cream, Toasted Almond Brittle and 1 White Chocolate and Raspberry Trifle  Grand Marnier Mascarpone Cream.  We were satisfied with each dessert and they were absolutely delicious. I'd have to say that I felt rather comfortable in this restaurant and I thought for sure I wouldn't be as it is a classy establishment.  The restaurant had the perfect noise level (though as the night went on I noticed it got a bit louder as it got busier but we still didn't have to scream at one another to hear each other).  The service was prompt and we didn't have to wait long between each course.  The waitress was knowledgeable and able to answer questions regarding the drinks and the food.  We were not rushed to eat our food and nor were we rushed to pay the check and get out (something I really liked).  The portions were perfect and each dish we had tasted awesome.  Was thoroughly pleased with our meals and the service we received."}
{"text":"For appetizer, I had the Spiced Garlic Shrimp, served with Black Pepper Pernod Butter, Fennel & Pine Nut Slaw. My friend (who is amazing and awesome and fantastic to say the least, and also a donkey enthusiast) had the House-Smoked Duck Prosciutto and let me try some. The shrimp was nothing special, not at all memorable. The Prosciutto was more flavourful than the shrimp, but also nothing to write home about.  For entree I had the Cast-Iron Seared Cobia Bass, which was awesome! As you can tell by the picture, it was a generous serving of fish. I hate going to a restaurant and leaving hungry. I may be going to nice restaurants, but I don't do small portions, trust me. The bass was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. And I also loved the crab firecrackers, I can get an entree with just those guys alone.  Come visit my blog to read more and drool over some photos! :)  http://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/07/rose-water-restaurant.html"}
{"text":"For an event venue and non-foodie place, we thought the dinner Rosewater was pretty good. Its a nice venue  with its high ceiling, pretty murals but to be honest, we didn't have high hopes for the food. We were redeeming a gift certificate and thought it would be a nice night out.    We ordered some reasonably priced wines and sampled the types of bread which were okay.  Went straight for the main course  (Tagliatelle and Cornish hen) which were both well prepared and delicious.  Sure its no 'Torito' or 'Black Hoof' but maybe they are not going for that. Some places are just for the experience of dining at a glamorous place. Its definitely a more 'older-non foodie' crowd though.   I do have to say I expected better service from such a high end place. My theory is that if you aren't looking to score high points on your menu, you should excel in service and ambiance.  We weren't even brought water or attended to for the first 20 minutes and it wasn't a busy night at all. Until a manage saw us glancing around, none of the 6/7 servers milling around came to our table.  We finally got a nice enough guy but who was a bit pushy with appetizers and dessert. He checked in often  and when I said I was too full from the main to order dessert, he commented about how that would be true because I finished that giant plate of pasta!!! DUDE, not cool! you never say that to a girl. Obviously, we didn't say anything and left a generous tip. But in retrospect, I'm not sure if there's a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious 2012.   Overall, venue is excellent, service was ok, but food was just OK.   Chili Garlic Shrimp - OK Medium Steak - Poorly executed. Flavorless and try and a bit overcooked for my taste. Portion was pretty big though. Choco Mousse - Just fair.   I also thought it was tacky that a place like this would automatically add gratuity to the bill (18% - we were a group of 8)."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious menu. I heard a lot about this place and had been meaning to go here for years. I must admit...it was slightly anti climatic... The butternut squash soup was tasteless (although the croutons in the soup were super yum). The duck confit was ok and the bread pudding was more bread than pudding. Service was super slow and not very attentive - maybe because we were on winterlicious menu? Maybe my expectations were too high, but overall quite disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Ktimene on this.  The interior is great and very impressive but the menu they serve for Winterliscious is pathetic and tasteless.   I went there 2 years ago for Winterliscious and had the exact same menu and experience.  You would think that serving the exact same dishes for over 2 years now that they would have at least improved the taste? Too Bad Rosewater as you are such a great building and grand interior. Why cheap out on the Winterliscous menu?  If you are not going to give 100% then simply stop participating in the semi-annual event....."}
{"text":"Cocktails were awesome, I became good friends with Moscow Mule. The bartender was friendly and efficient. The restaurant is inviting and comfortable. The food was amazing. Loved the beet salad and the risotto. Service was great."}
{"text":"Excellent service, very nice atmosphere, delicious food. I came with my boyfriend and we were seated side-by-side in a lovely mini couch seat. This really made our dinner even more romantic. I had the Seared Atlantic Salmon with beet and wild rice risotto. It was absolutely amazing! One of my top places to go for the best fish meal."}
{"text":"The word Winterlicious must be synonymous with \"treat me like shit and serve me dry salmon\" because that certainly seems to be the case this year.   Rosewater on a normal day with a normal menu is a great restaurant to eat and be served in (creative menu, fresh ingredients and great service) but the minute the word 'winterlicious' uttered from our mouths upon entering, all smiles disappeared and we were led promptly to a wobbly table in the upstairs dining room. It is such a shame that good service needs to be absent for a city wide food festival such as this.  The food was a hit and miss on every course. The apps were very stale and dry (thank god for the great selection of Mike Weir wines to help wash it all down) however, the maple smoked chicken on focaccia was juicy and full of flavour served alongside baked frites. For dessert, my brioche downright sucked whereas my friends sorbet rocked her knickers right off."}
{"text":"A charming and elegant restaurant with average food. If only the quality of food matched the ambiance and decor. The service was great throughout dinner. Overall, the food was passable for a place of this caliber. Nothing stood out, beef rib was dry, ravioli was cold... the sticky pudding was their saving grace."}
{"text":"Friend had a gift certificate going expire soon, so we two foodies went and tried it out.   Starter seared scallop turned out to be just a-okay, but the risotto that came with the scallop was fantastic. we both had the duck for main, which was absolutely delicious, i was please with that choice. And the chocolate molten cake was just heart melting.   also our server was very helpful and knowledgeable with the wine choices.   overall environment of the restaurant was very nice and classy, even with the busy crowd coming in for the winterlicious menu."}
{"text":"Classy but food quality lacking.   came here with another couple for winterlicious. Lots of great selections and yummy options. We got the lentil soup and prawn toast, lamb shank and the duck, and for desserts, banana creme pie and the pecan dessert.  Overall the service was not good. the waiter never filled our waters and when waiting to be served dessert for 15min he asked would you like the bill, and forgot that he didnt serve dessert yet.    The quality has much to improve.  the food is not amazing all things considered. it was medicore at best but given the atmosphere and location and the hype, we would not come backagain."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a charming gem of a location in the Financial District, Rosewater has a very charming interior. Some trivia would include the popular USA Networks Suits was filmed here for a dinner scene between Harvey and his old mentor. The service was good and we had a lovely Chardonnay to accompany our soup of the day which was a light parsnip puree with creme fraiche. We ordered the seared trout which was perfectly roasted and the flakes of fish came apart at the light touch, very delicate! We also ordered the gnocchi with gorgonzola and pear and walnuts and that was a refreshing and satisfying meal for a business lunch."}
{"text":"It's alright. I've attended 2 events, had lunch and 2 dinners.  While I wouldn't be raving about it, it's a nice building and the interior is nicely decorated.  By no means is the food exquisite."}
{"text":"A DRINK SPECIAL IN THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT !!??   Tuesday and Thursday special- $3.00 mix drinks, $3.50 beer $5.00 wine ( not sure if it was 6oz or 9oz) and $25 for a bottle.  This is unheard of in the Financial District!!   Myself and several co-workers decide to head down for drinks on a Tuesday, two and half hours later we grabbed the bill only too realize that we collectively spent $95 with tip. WOW !! not bad for 4 people considering this place is right in the Financial District.  From what I recall my double vodka sodas came up to $6.25 a drink, and the premium pint Stella was $3.50....however I would have to say it is not a full pint but never the less still well worth it.  I was told that Thursday evenings are jammed packed with the Bay St suit crowd, if you don't mind the suits then Thursday are for you if not go on a Tuesday.  I am giving this place 4 stars because we never bothered looking at the menu when offered, we were a little shocked to find out that there was a cheap drink special given the location of this place. Still very surprising that mix drinks were included in this special since the only drink specials on Bay St. seem to be beer.   The interior is nice as well, we noticed booths for intimate dinners, a second floor that sort of looks over the bottom and a small lounge area with sofa's. I would imagine dinner would be in the $100+ range, something on my to do list.  Pros- Cheap Drinks           Good Friendly Service  Cons- Special ends at 8pm ( not really sure if this is a con but if you arrive at 7:55 you will be disappointed)  Conclusion- Will be coming back !!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed!  I've been to the Rosewater with clients in the private rooms.  Always had a good time and the food was good.  Recently reserved for my Partner's Birthday and had 12 people attend.  When I reserved I requested a private room because I knew we were going to be loud and I didn't want to disturb others trying to have a nice dinner.  I was subsequently told that they could accommodate but there was a minimum charge of $850. Not wanting to push my friends to spend more than they wanted, I didn't know if we would get to the min amount.  I decided to forego the private room.    I called to order a birthday cake and was told they don't offer this.  I could however bring my own, which is what I did.  We went to the restaurant on Friday night 8:00 pm and it was relatively empty.  We had a nice table at the back of the restaurant that made it wonderful for surprising the guest of honour. We did see a couple change seat because we were too noisy for them as I suspected.  Btw, all of the private rooms were empty.  We ordered our food.  It took a bit of time but we could live with that.  When we started eating, most of the people in our party we not thrilled with their meal.  Some thought it was lacking in taste while those who ordered the tagliatelle complained to the waiter that the herds over-powered the meal. The restaurant quickly fixed the problem by bringing out 2 of the same dish but with less herbs.  It was better but just ok.  we were having a good time when suddenly the birthday cake was Brought out without us having requested it.  2 more people were joining us for cake and coffee and they had not arrived yet.  We really felt rushed as the staff was cleaning the restaurant around us.  By 11:00 we felt so rushed we just decided to leave.  This is a Friday downtown Toronto during TIFF.  Place was empty by 10:15 except for us.  Not the feeling and atmosphere I was expecting.  I will not be holding any more events at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went a while back and hadn't gotten around to writing a review --awful experience-- went on a Thursday... so loud the bar was jammed and totally ruined the vibe of our dinner .. This place needs to figure out what it is are you an Earls type after dinner drink spot or are you a nice restaurant ?!?!.....you're called the rosewater supper club so I would expect more and a nicer vibe what a trashy crowd !!!! ...the 3 $ drinks thing...?!? Like really what are you sneaky dees?!? ...trash trash trash ....even though we were in the dining room it sounded like there was a rave going on right next to us our waiter was an asshole and so stuck up...dismissive and rude. There was a group at the table next to us and there was a fat loud drunk guy that was being so obnoxious ...everybody else at the surrounding tables was looking at him and none of the staff did anything about it... What a disappointment what should've been a nice romantic quiet dinner was the opposite .. And to boot the food wasn't even very good. NEVER going back and would never recommend it.."}
{"text":"Note -this is a review of the Rosewater Room (the events venue), not the Rosewater Supper Club (the restaurant)!   The Rosewater Room is an exceptional venue to book for a wedding or formal party. It is beside the well-known Rosewater Supper Club (at 19 Toronto Street), located in a neo-classical building with its own entrance and elevator.  After much research, my husband and I were very happy to find this venue for our wedding. Its decor boasts hand crafted chandeliers and mouldings and echoes the feeling of an intimate ballroom (sans le fromage). What's so cost effective about this place is that with such beautiful architectural details, very little had to be spent in the way of florals or decor. All of our guests commented on the exquisite architectural details and the professional service and staff. The venue also has an in-house event planner  who is exceptional and so easy to work with. My only qualm is that the wine list was quite limited. The food was \"good\" but being foodies, it's not  the most lavish culinary experience we've ever had. By wedding food standards though, it was exceptional. If you're looking for a venue for your wedding, do yourself a favour and make an appointment to see this space. It ended up being quite cost effective and completely hassle and headache free."}
{"text":"Excellent and Classy restaurant. The service was amazing and the food delicious. Even though it is a bit expensive it is worth every penny. The place is very spacious for group events and corporate events. The interiors are as elegant as they can be. The staff is always there looking after their clientele."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant this past Valentine's Day and I had a remarkable experience. I'm not sure why the price range for this place only has 3 \"$\" but it was pretty expensive! No complaints though as you really get what you paid for. Atmosphere and service were top notch. Most importantly, the food was very delicious at very reasonable portions. I had the following:  1. French onion soup 2. Steak (can't really the size but it wasn't too small nor too big) 3. Gelato  I know it looks like a very simple palate but I loved every bit of it! Make sure you consider this restaurant for a special occasion :)"}
{"text":"Came here to try this place for the first time for summerlicious.  Started with the mango-tangerine juice ($4) which was nice and sweet. The bread basket was varied and all the breads were fresh, so dinner was off to a good start.  Had the ravioli appetizer that came with some crab claws which complemented the pea taste nicely. I'm not sure I tasted the tarragon in the crab claws, but their seasoning was definitely tasty. The swordfish main dish was very good, cooked just right, seasoned well, and a good portion. I'm not sure it was chimichurri, more like ratatouille on top, but it tasted good nevertheless. The eggplant was a nice addition to the dish, very flavorful. The sea beans were OK, I guess I'm not a big fan of them to begin with, so if you're a bean specialist, you'll have to read someone else's review. The peanut butter dessert was nice and light, a rare dessert dish that includes peanut butter and doesn't leave you feeling like an overfed hippo. The berry mascarpone could have been just a a tiny little bit more tart and less sweet, but all in all, the dessert was well balanced, pleasant, and a great choice for summer.  The servers were upbeat, friendly, and professional, and the decor of the place was welcoming and modern. All in all, for a $35 summerlicious dinner, it was a pleasant dining experience. I'd be curious to try the fish dishes on their regular menu."}
{"text":"I didn't rate this place 5 only because I don't have the credibility to do so. But it was surely quite the dining experience, it wasn't just a dinner. The variations of flavours used in the first course, main course and desert were unlike no other. This place is just the right place to go if you want your dinner to be an experience and not just to eat. **whine is also nice. :)"}
{"text":"Husband and I came for dinner here last night for our anniversary.  Hostess was really nice and remembered it was our anniversary and gave us a spacious booth.  Our waiter was really nice and friendly and was able to suggest a lot of alternatives and options since my diet has been a bit restrictive.  The main reasons for the 2 star rating:  We waited over an hour for our dinner to arrive.  And it was very disappointing to see a couple who sat next to us who arrived 20 mins after us get their food first.    In terms of the food, I guess we were pretty hungry when it did finally arrive, we weren't that impressed.  My husband had the Korean BBQ duo.  He said it was extremely salty and the noodles did not seem fresh.  I had the Que Duck breast.  It was ok...a slight bit too salty as well.  The hashbrown that came with it was all soggy.  We originally had wanted to stay for dessert but because we waited so long for our food, we decided to go elsewhere.  I don't think we'd come back here...even for a winter/summer licious type of event.  There are so many better upscale restaurants downtown that we would prefer to go to."}
{"text":"We attended Summerlicious at Rosewater this year and I personally loved everything I ordered (but was not very adventurous outside my usual tastes).  From feedback of my friends, they felt their dishes were satisfactory.  Food Quality & Price: $35 Prix Fixe Menu and a great bonus was a Summerlicious drink list (majority of drinks were $5!!).  Appetizer (Salmon Gravlax) - Incredible!! I love salmon sashimi so knowing what that salmon gravlax was on the menu, there was no other choice I would've went with. The Crab Minestrone offered was watery and left much to be desired. No one had salad. Entree - Choice of Rack of BBQ Korean Pork, Flatiron Steak, Mahi Mahi Fish and the Portebello Mushroom Au Gratin (a vegetarian casserole if you will). I had the steak, friends had the pork.  Pork was not what they expected (they were thinking ribs), it's more like porkchops.  Quality of the pork was okay.  In my case, I ordered the Flatiron steak and it was delicious!! The waiter was kind enough to tell us that it is thin so anything over medium would taste too chewy.  Friend ordered hers rare, mine was medium rare.  When it arrived, both steaks looked identical inside. Dessert - All three deserts had satisfactory reviews. If you want something light, go for sorbet. The Chocolate Terrine is VERY smooth (almost like a mousse cake), key lime tart has a fancy presentation but tasted like an average key lime pie. Drinks: Rosewater offered a great Summerlicious drink menu $5 each!! 300ml Stella, Red/White Sangria, Pomegranate Margarita, Fresh Strawberry Mojito, Bourbon Berry Lemonade. The Bourbon Berry Lemonade is musky and strong. For people who like light and fruity drinks get the Strawberry Mojito.  It has mint and lime in it (very strong mint taste).  I had two, it was THAT good.  Facility: Lovely decor and romantic. Not loud at all despite the large crowd (likely for Summerlicious). We were seated upstairs in the middle of the floor - 5 of us at a table for 4. There were two bachelorette parties that evening and they had \"sections\" off the service area but clearly audible and visible (not very private). The only private rooms were in the basement by the washrooms. I did not get a chance to see the main floor.  Washrooms were clean, decent, floor to ceiling mirrors and a mini vanity in the women's.   Service: Incredible.  We had the pleasure of Galen's polite yet jovial service. No pressure for having a late member to the party, swift reaction time to spilled water (he was by my side in a second!), ensured all water glasses were filled was very knowledgeable about the menu. As Summerlicious patrons, I expect to get the short end of the stick usually, and though Rosewater did place us in an awkward location, Galen picked up the slack by giving exceptional service.  Food left the kitchen at an inconsistent pace. Apps and Desert were out in a wink, entrees took forever.   Overall: Rosewater reached my expectations and I was very pleased with the experience.  I would return (even as a non-Summerlicious customer)."}
{"text":"Last night (a Wednesday) I attended a networking event at the Rosewater Room organized by Women of Influence.  I really liked the upstairs space used - with windows at both the front and back of the building and beautiful moldings etc. this a beautiful space.  With over 150 people in attendance there was still space to move around and mingle behind the formal seating area.  The service was courteous and efficient - absolutely no complaints about how the event was managed by the Rosewater Room staff. The passed food was delicious and warm, which are both always a appreciated when you don't know what to expect.  Not that I have experience working with the venue, but as a guest I would consider this space if organizing an event in the future - for a personal or corporate event."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to go to the Rosewater because it seems so highly regarded. So to kick off the long weekend, I made a Friday dinner reservation. When we arrived, the place was quite empty, except for two other tables of diners. Yet still we were seated at the table beside the waiter station, so we politelly asked for another seat.   I can't speak for my husband, but I was very disappointed in the food, although he did say that what he had was \"underwhelming\". I started with the lobster ravioli appetizer, which came in a dark brown cream sauce and was covered in pork chunks (of all things), which completely overwhelmed the entire dish. If there was any seafood in the ravioli, it was impossible to taste.   For my main, I ordered the duck but first asked the waiter if he recommended it and how he suggested it be cooked. His response alleviated my concern about it being tough or overcooked, which is often possible with duck. But I figured in an upscale restaurant such as this, that was unlikely to be a concern. Unfortunately it was like trying to cut into a piece of shoe leather. I had to literally saw my way through the meat and it took me forever to chew. It was served with a small portion of a type of duck puff pastry, the only good thing on the plate. When asked if we'd like dessert, we politely declined, afraid of how they might mess that up.  I will say that the waiters who served us were very good, and our martinis were nicely made. But the food was so disappointing, which was exacerbated by the size of the bill at the end of the night. No, we will never be returning again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a romantic night out for dinner, Rosewater is a great place. Take your date, gf or wife for special days. Great food, ambiance and service."}
{"text":"We were married on Saturday, April 5th, 2014 at the Rosewater Room and words simply cannot do this place justice.  I'm thrilled to write that every aspect of our special day exceeded all expectations.  My review is a detailed account of our wedding.  It's a long one, but I'm paying it forward since I relied heavily on well written reviews to plan my own wedding.  COORDINATOR- 10/10 Renee, Rosewaters' in house wedding coordinator, is the star of the show.  From day one, she showed genuine interest and professionalism with each interaction exchanged.  She responded to e-mails and phone calls promptly (and there were many) and diligently followed up on every request or concern we had.     VENUE DECOR/AMBIANCE- 9/10 The Rosewater is an old renovated building that has retained its charm and features original elements (recessed ceilings bordered by regal crown molding, beams, chandeliers, gorgeous mahogany wood floors throughout). Weddings take place at The Rosewater Room on the second floor.  For privacy, the wedding venue has a separate entrance with a large majestic staircase and an elevator. The staircase is very dated and in need of a facelift (shabby carpet, lighting...) The open-concept layout boasts floor-to-ceiling windows, chandeliers, a fireplace, a bridal suite, an outdoor patio (for smokers) and 4 private washrooms. The reception area consists of 12 square tables, elegant AND comfortable chairs, high quality white linens and Royal Doulton china.  Everything you need is provided by the venue; however, you can opt to rent outside supplies. (I honestly don't know why anyone would)  The room needs very little additional decor. The setting is elegant and intimate.     FOOD - 9/10 Overall, the food was excellent.  I had read many positive reviews raving about the quality and I'm happy to say that our expectations were exceeded.  Having been a guest at so many weddings we've lost count, we were painfully aware that most venues fall short in the food department since   neither of us could recall a single memorable meal.  But being self-proclaimed foodies, our wedding meal was of utmost importance to us.     Hors d'oeuvres - 10/10 (assorted) Passed hors d'oeuvres during cocktail hour.  The lamb chops and the empanadas are to die for.   Appetizer - 8/10 (antipasto plate) Prosciutto, salami, boconccini, cantaloupe and grilled veggies - in my opinion, this is a nice alternative to a standard salad.  Delicious combination and the ingredients were fresh and well presented.  Could have used a side of olive oil? Pasta - 10/10 (penne with tomato sauce) I enjoyed mine and my husband's portion with heaps of fresh parmesan cheese... The tomato sauce tasted like it was made in a Tuscan kitchen and the penne was cooked perfectly al dente. Main Course - 10/10 (steak with bourbon glaze and herb crusted chicken with white wine sauce, garlic mash, vegetables) Prepping 115 steaks, all cooked to perfection, accompanied by chicken that is warm and juicy is a skill that very few kitchens can boast. The quality of both the chicken and the beef was outstanding as well.  The garlic mash was whipped to perfection and topped with 2 asparagus tips (not overcooked) and a buttery carrot.  The food was served hot and well presented.   Dessert - 10/10 (Tahitian vanilla creme brulee) By far, one of the best creme brulees enjoyed so far in my lifetime.   Late Night Fare - 7/10 (sliders, montreal poutine, gruyere grilled cheese) The sliders were phenomenal - so juicy -10/10 The Montréal poutine and the grilled cheese were special orders (not part of the menu) so kudos for accommodating our request!  I was disappointed with the size of the poutine - the container held 4-5 french fries and 1 cheese curd topped with gravy.  Not worth $5 - you can't give French Canadians bite sized poutine!   5/10 The grilled cheese was overdone.  It almost seems like it was deep fried to its undesirable crispiness.  5/10  BEVERAGES - 8/10 (premium bar package) The good:  great selection of beers and premium spirits, shots permitted, espresso and cappuccino  The bad:  Their red house wine is awful.  Even with the premium bar upgrade, no choices.  It would be nice to let the hosts select from 2 or 3 different reds (of same value) because we really didn't see ourselves serving wine that we couldn't palate.  We wound up purchasing wine from their corporate wine list and paid for every bottle consumed.    COST - 10/10 This venue is very reasonably priced for a Saturday night wedding in downtown Toronto.  If you book your wedding between January-March, a 10% winter discount is applied.  Food & Drink packages range from $105-$125/plate.  Add $10 to upgrade to premium bar package.  One cost we hadn't initially taken into account was the mandatory gratuity (16%) and the HST (13%).  This is something to consider because it inflates your final bill by 30%.  Our final cost was $156/plate for 115 guests"}
{"text":"When the waiter cannot give you recommendations on cocktails that you should order, it can likely mean they haven't really tried the menu.   This place had food that was alright with the highlight being the salmon gravlax. The seared mahi mahi I had was far too salty and ruined the dining experience for me.   The strawberry mojito on the other hand is very good and something I would have again.  Overall, this place would get a 7/10 for me.

{"text":"I've been Rosewater a few times and it has always been amazing. From the apps down to the dessert. I've been here for lunch, dinner, summerlicious, and just because I wanted to. Each time I leave, I already want to plan my next trip there. I like my food flavourful and it definitely satisfies my taste buds.  There's not much I can say, the food is great, the servers are kind, and I first discovered poached pears here (which I now love). I would definitely go back. For dinner with a cocktail, app, main course, and dessert, I would say it costed each of us about $100; it's worth it."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend recently. The venue was amazing and our waiter in particular was one of the best that I had. We enjoyed our dinner and had a pleasant time.  I noticed that they are one of the participating restuarants of Summerlicious festival which starts I believe July 4th. We'll visit again !!"}
{"text":"The theme at Rosewater is \"too much goin' on\".... This goes for both the decor with its garish, over-the-top, attempt at elegance as well as the food which is either over-spiced or tries to make use of flavors that simply overpower one another.  When I walked in the door it felt like I'd just stepped into a scene from Scarface. 80s' lavish excess is the style they seemed to be going for here. The crowd looked like it was made up of rich guys from Woodbridge with too much cologne and hair gel trying to impress their floozyesque dates.  Now lets get to the food. We started with the seared fois gras. The actual liver was delish, however it was served with cooked fig which is too sweet and overpowers the delicate flavor of the duck liver. An amateur mistake, if you ask me. We also had the Beef Tataki - WAY over-spiced - I could barely taste the meat. On to the mains! The Big Eyed tuna was over-spiced, are you getting the theme here? The tuna itself was a wonderful cut of fish cooked to perfection but ruined by a heavy handed cook. We also had the Black Cod on flavorless mashed  potatoes drizzled with what appeared to be Cambell's  vegetable soup. On top of the cod were two over-cooked, rubbery shrimp - another amateur mistake.  We didn't even attempt dessert since by this point it was clear the caliber of the cuisine did not match price tag. Thankfully we had $50 off coupon - a sure sign the restaurant is in trouble.  The only good thing about this place was the service. The staff were all very cheerful, bubbly and helpful. I'm happy their attitudes didn't match the pretense of their surrounding.  In my opinion, the dinning experience should be 90% food and 10% everything else. This place was designed to cater to the flashy yet unrefined wannabe gourmet who's crude pallet and desire to impress their date with big checks and ostentatious surroundings override the value of good food... If you're even the slightest bit a foodie, save yourself the trip - even if you do have a coupon."}
{"text":"Tucked away on Toronto street this place is a great spot and a new favourite. Environment is great, staff are well versed and the food is delightful. Worth it any time."}
{"text":"I've been to the Rosewater for a PR function a year or two ago and I remember the food & service being great so I had to revisit during Summerlicious this year. When i went into the restaurant, the bar was full of people talking, drinking so it was really loud.  In the dining room, it was prety loud as well.  Salmon Gravlax:  It was served with young asparagus, apple & fennel salad in maple mustard.  I especially enjoyed the salad with the salmon.  It was very light and flavourful. This was a good portion for an appetizer as it enticed my palate for the next dishes to come.  Crab Minestrone:  This was very a pretty dish but I'm not a fan of Minestrone soups so i may be biased in my opinion.  Made with summer vegetables, tomato consommé, and black pepper crab sitting atop a piece of bread, my friend said it was mediocre.  If you like light soups, try this.  Flatiron Steak:  dish was cooked perfectly at medium rare, served with new cellar potato smash, frizzled onions, and balsamic vinegar jus.  I want to go back for more.  Key Lime Tart: too beautiful to eat!  Rosewater has really impressed us with presentation.  It was creamy, sweet with the right amount of acidity from the lime & berries.  House-Spun Trio of Sorbet: The flavours were peach, strawberry and blueberry. I really enjoyed this because it cooled me down and had the right amount of sweetness to finish off a big meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! The food and service were exceptional! We had a large group (14 people) for my boyfriend's birthday.  They put us in a private room which was a nice surprise. The food was wonderful and the wait staff was attentive and very friendly."}
{"text":"This actually deserves 3.5 stars. After reading Yelp reviews and the menu, I had hoped for more. I left disappointed, but not enough to dismiss the place altogether. I would return to give it another shot.   Firstly, I've only been here once and it was for Winterlicious 2014 - lunch. I believe my review may not be an entirely accurate reflection of the restaurant, but I'm also not sure of that.   Ambience: The place itself is huge and very well decorated. It was contemporary and quite romantic, but also modern and stylish. The decor really stood out for me. Note: We felt rather chilly during our dining experience.   Service: It was a bit slow at times, but they were quite busy. We didn't find that there were overly long wait periods, but the pace could have been a tad speedier. The waiter we had was friendly and unpretentious. No stand out service though.   Food: Nothing I had was too memorable, and in comparison to my other Winterlicious 2014 experience a week early at Canoe, this meal paled. Here is what we ordered   - Duck Salad  - Freshly Squeezed Juice (Mango-Orange) - Some Fruity Cocktail  - Another Fruity Cocktail w/Prosecco  - Pan-Seared Rainbow Trout  - Cornish Hen - Braised Beef Panino (I think)  - Sorbet  - Bread Pudding  - Molten Lava Cake w/Rum-Bananas   We all started with the smoked duck salad. I truly enjoyed this dish. It had an ample amount of nicely smoked duck, and a surprise of lentils under the leafy greens. It was quite tasty. My SO didn't particularly enjoy it, and my brother and 2 other friends liked it, but didn't love it.   Now, the drinks we ordered were fabulous. It helped that they were also $5 and under (I believe a special Winterlicious promotion, which was a very nice touch). The juice was amazing - thick and fresh and full of flavour. Two of our party ordered a cocktail that I don't remember the name of - they both enjoyed it. I ordered a cocktail with Prosecco, and it was absolutely delicious.   The main course disappointed me - at least mine did. But I was also disappointed in the inconsistency. Given that we did come for lunch, I expected the portions to be a little smaller, and that is fine - I'm usually not that hungry around lunch time. However, two of us (including me) ordered the pan-seared rainbow trout, and found it to be ridiculously small. What put us off more was when we noted the other dishes, which were slightly larger, one being so large my friend had to pack half to go. I found the vast inconsistency in size to be a little unpolished for a restaurant such as Rosewater.   That being said, the fish I had was flavourful and I especially loved the beet risotto - it was creamy and had a bit of cheesiness, but went so well with the fish. I was unsatisfied with the portion, and although I did enjoy the flavour of the dish altogether, it did not stand out for me.   My brother and SO had the Cornish hens. This dish was larger than my fish dish - medium sized, relatively. They both enjoyed their meals, but my SO complained that parts of his hen were slightly dry, while my brother applauded the juiciness of his. Again, inconsistency. Not impressive. My SO also found his meal unmemorable. I also noted that they served this dish with a rather sad and flavourless side of steamed veggies - why?  My friend ordered the braised beef panino I believe. Her dish was HUGE, compared to the rest of ours. She had leftover fries and half a sandwich after her SO helped her with some of her meal (he also ordered the fish, like me, and was not full, like me). She commended the meal and said it was quite good. I tried the fries and they were delicious, but I've also had better.   I'm a little fuzzy on what we had for dessert. I know my brother and I both ordered the trio of sorbet, and I believe my SO and my other 1 friend ordered the bread pudding, while another the molten lava cake. The sorbet was dismissible. I enjoyed the mango sorbet, the fresh fruits, but it was really nothing spectacular. Whatever my SO and friend got though, was very delicious. The problem with consistency lay here as well - my SO's dessert was considerably larger than mine.   Overall, the place wasn't BAD, but it didn't blow me away either. For that, I give it 3.5 stars. I doubt I would pay regular price to dine here, but I just may have to, to give them another shot. They didn't put me off altogether, but there is a lot of improvement to be made if my experience is any reflection of their regular dining experience. For a restaurant of their stature, they can do better for sure. I didn't appreciate the inconsistency, and found the food underwhelmingly small (I didn't leave satisfied/full), however, the flavours definitely had potential.   Note: My two friends who dined with us went again later that week for dinner and said they enjoyed themselves more. They commented on how the portion sizes were larger and there were more choices. This is another reason I would give the place another chance"}
{"text":"Came in for Summerlicious.  I have been waiting for over 7 minutes and no one has come to even say hello.  Now it's been 9 minutes and still nothing. 11 minutes now and we have not even gotten water... Who is my waitress/waiter I wonder. 15 minutes finally ordered my beer! They seemed to have forgotten my bread :(. Maybe I have to ask for it.... Let's try... As I was gonna ask for it he said he was bringing it.  I asked the waiter for an explanation of one of the food items.  He was very helpful and knowledgeable about it.  Appetizers are here.  There was the wild mushroom cappuccino (soup) which literally tasted like you were eating a wild mushroom - a little too bland and plain, not much flavour at all. There was also the mixed baby green salad with the breaded fried cheese, which escapes my name at the moment.  It was pretty good, but the dressing had a strong onion flavour. The cheese was the best part - it melted in your mouth. There were only two small pieces of it and I wish there was at least one more. Now I'm being made fun of for drinking my beer before the main course.  My main dish is here ! It was delicious - steak frites. The steak was juicy and perfectly cooked, with a tasty drizzling of sauce, and the fries were great and thinly sliced. It also came with a small bowl of greens. Hopefully the dessert still come soon.... It's been at least 15 minutes since we finished our main. The dessert finally arrived and was delicious. We had the White Chocolate Raspberry Trifle... Over all food was great, waiter was very polite, but service was very very slow."}
{"text":"Guess what? Coming into Rosewater in different days can give you completely different experiences. I have been here a couple of times: often for work related events on the second floor , of course, Thursday's cheap drinks, and lunches. I have to say that I am very impressed by the lunch I had here today for winterlicious. It was definitely reasonably priced with 23 dollars, coming with tiger prawns as my appetizer, pork ribs that were cooked for 48 hours as the main and 3 big scoops of 3 favors sorbets as my dessert. The quality for all three dishes are consistent. I would not call these are the top notch fining dinning experience but they definitely serve my hunger and desire for good quality good with great proximity to my office in the financial district !  Btw, this place is definitely busy and if you are looking for dining, try to make a reservation, and yes do expect there are lots of people during these cheap drink nights!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner and a wedding in the past. The food is good. The dessert is excellent. Good customer service."}
{"text":"Date Night!  Third date in 11ish months for me and my man :)  Although it was a work related function, I still had a wonderful time.  Dinner was held on the second floor of the restaurant in a private banquet type room.  Lots of sparkly and pretty chandeliers.  Decor seemed very English.  Made me think of tea, biscuits, and big floppy hats.  Meal was decent.  I had the lamb as an entree and it was pretty yummy but it did not knock my socks off.  About 30% of my cut was just fat - it was kind of sickening.  The portion size was also a little small.  For sides, all I had was two or three pieces of asparagus and maybe 4 pieces of potato, and one carrot.  My husband had the veal (which I just didn't feel like trying - its a baby!) which he said was decent as well - did not knock his socks off either.    Dessert was creme brulee and it was fabulous!!!!    Service was really friendly.  Not sure if we would come back on our own and spend our own hard earned dollars at this place (based on what was served to us that night)  ... but any chance to wear a party dress and high heels is a fun night for me :)"}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant. The decor is really nice. Our server was on top of his game...seemed like an old school waiter. The restaurant has a bar at the from. seems to get an after work crowd... mostly females Food vine ripened tomatoes- 5/5 amazing seared scallops- 4.5/5 seared tuna- 4/5 rack of lamb- 5.5/5"}
{"text":"I love coming here for their Tuesday and Thursday after work drink specials. Half off cocktails in a classy environment? Yes please.    The resto/lounge is spacious and spans 3 floors. The decor is refined yet manages to escape the feeling of pretense. Did I mention they've banned straws? Let's all save the turtles I say.   The crowd mostly consists of suits. Business casual at its best.  On this particular night I ordered the seared salmon with beet risotto. Wonderfully grilled, the salmon offered just enough flake and melt in your mouth goodness. While the beet risotto was a delightful surprise right underneath it.   Keep up with the good work Rosewater, one straw at a time."}
{"text":"We received a gift certificate for Rosewater Lounge for our anniversary and decided to check it out the weekend after. It happened to be on the first day of summerlicious and the place was packed but they managed to reserve a great table for us. We didn't do the summerlicious menu (not allowed with a gift certificate) but the food was really good. My husband ordered a steak and i got the risotto and finished with a great dessert. They have a great selection of wine and the service was fantastic. We spent about three hours over dinner and really liked ambience (large and romantic). Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I can't find a review that actually has someone coming here for non-winterlicious and non-work event so that might be saying something about this restaurant. I've found that winterlicious and summerlicious reviews to be a bit unfair to the restaurant. At the end of the day, these \"licious\" items aren't on their regular menu.   I've come to Rosewater for Asian Drink Thursdays and it's a great way to hang out with coworkers or friends that work nearby. (Read: Cheap drinks and packed full of Yappies. Don't come here for a formal dinner on Thursdays)   This design of the restaurant is really good. It screams \"fancy\" and \"expensive\". Shows like Suits have been filmed here, and for good reason. Service was okay/good. Ambiance is fine as well.   So why isn't Rosewater more popular for regular dinner? Well its obvious... its the food.   I've come here and had their Pan Seared Duck Breast which is actually on their main dinner menu. (I won't comment on the dessert and appetizer since neither of those were on their actual menu) The duck is good, albeit a little salty and undercooked. I'm still not sure if duck is okay served medium rare since it is a poultry and Google says that you need to serve duck fully cooked...  At the end of the day, Rosewater looks better than the food tastes. This place is amazing for cheap drinks and business meetings but I wouldn't come back here for their regular menu dinner or another whateverlicious. The food was certainly good but doesn't justify the price or the risk of getting avian flu."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with the GF on a Thursday night and what can I say the bar area is full of business guys and girls in suits trying to \"hook\" up!  It's loud and there are tons of people there for the cheap drinks and socializing.  Not typically my thing, but we were slowly moved to the dining area where there was a bit less noise.  The decor is nice and the interior looks fancy and well put together.  I can't really say the same for the food.  The server seemed a bit uptight and brought out the food in a decent amount of time.  Due to the front being so busy, I guess the kitchen was a bit backed up.  One of the dishes we ordered was the lobster ravioli.  I found that it tasted previously frozen and there was lobster shell bits in there to boot.  The server asked us if we wanted another dish and they brought out the Beef Tournado au Poivre instead (which we had to pay for).  It was decent, but your typical streak really.  I ordered the duck, and it was well cooked, but again nothing memorable.    Overall I'm sure this place would be a bit more quiet on a regular non happy hour day, but I definitely would not recommend going here for dinner on a Thursday.  The atmosphere inside is nice and the place looks fancy, but the food and service to me were both forgettable for the price paid."}
{"text":"We booked a 6:30pm Summerlicious reservation ($35) on a week night. Surprised to find that the restaurant was extremely quiet. All of the other Yelp reviews which describe the lovely ambiance are right. I especially enjoyed the low background noise - no ear straining required to have a conversation.  Our table ordered:  Tiger Shrimp / Mushroom Cappuccino Cornish Hen / BC Snapper Brown Sugar Peach Crumble / White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  The dishes were tasty and good in portion size. Presentation of the main dishes were lovely but the proteins in the main dishes were slightly dry. Desserts were fantastic!  If you're interested in a pre-dinner drink, I would recommend the Elderflower Champagne cocktail.  Service was random throughout evening. Our waiter was very outgoing, but the time between dishes seemed to get longer.   We enjoyed our meal; however, there are many other great places to enjoy a Summerlicious menu in the City. If you want to experience the beautiful building and calm atmosphere, give Rosewater a try."}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying yes, I am a super fan of this place on a Thursday night!  So, I'm reviewing the bar & lounge specifically as the dining room is it's own entity.  On Tuesdays & Thursdays they have the countdown drink menu.  Yup, you heard that right and yes, it's the happiest of hours.  Until 8pm you can get $5 wine, $4 draft beer (and decent options too!) & BRACE YOURSELF $3 well drinks!!    There is something amazing about ordering 4 mixed drinks, throwing down a $20 and knowing you tipped like a Don!  Thursdays is when the party really gets going and this place gets super busy.  In the summer there is a tiny (but still existing) licensed space out front.  The bartenders are all amazing and have been there for years.  There is no stuffy financial district attitude with the service.   In true honest review form, I'm holding back the last star because after 8pm the prices can be a little rich for my blood and if you arrive late, you'll be left with standing room only.    If you work in the area or just happen to find yourself there, it's the perfect place for pre-gaming in an upscale locale on a shoe string budget."}
{"text":"You won't find this place on google when searching for \"happy hour drinks Toronto\" or \"cheap drinks Toronto\".  Usually only people that work in the financial district know about this after work watering hole. I used to frequent this place quite often as my office was right across the street.  Now the hostess and bartender's all recognize me.    Happy hour is on Tuesdays and Thursdays which begins at 5pm.  Happy Hour Offerings:   $2.75 mixed drinks $3.75 pints of domestic beer $5 glasses of wine, red or white (5oz)  $25 for the bottle of wine, red or white    You'll want to arrive early on Thursday since it gets packed by 5:30 pm and you'll see a lineup outside for people waiting to get in.  Once you get in it will be loud, very loud and music isn't even playing.  You'll find people standing around in their small groups yelling at each other just so that they can hear.  Getting into the bar area to order your drink could be a nightmare since people order their drinks and just stand there afterwards (I recommend ordering two drinks right at the start and if you're ordering mixed drinks, make them doubles.  Unless you're me, you will probably be waiting anywhere from 20-30 minutes for a bartender to come to you.  If you don't know how to slip into tight space and box out, you better learn or you're going to have a bad time.    I usually get here just before 5pm and more often than not be able to grab the couches with my crew.  Then I proceed to find Chandra who is awesome as she's my go to bartender and order a bottle of red wine so I don't have to bother with the crowd at the bar.  There are two floors with a bar on each to get drinks.  Crowd here is mostly young professionals in suit and tie or business casual.  Tips:  Tuesdays are a lot less busier than Thursdays Complimentary coat and bag check on Tuesdays, $1 for each item on Thursdays Would not recommend coming here for Dinner on Thursdays as it'll be loud I recommend getting the Frites ($6) to share, comes with garlic aioli Stand by the stairs on a Thursday and you'll see some drunk girls in stiletto's slip and fall down the stairs from time to time, Cheers!"}
{"text":"It was just OK. Maybe because we were with a Christmas party and we didn't get to eat off the menu I didn't really feel like we had much choice and when the food did come it was bland and cold, which normally happens when you're feeding 30 people at the exact same time. We sat in the top of the restaurant, which meant the bathroom was down 3 flights of stairs. It also meant all our drinks had to be waited on since the kitchen is also down 3 flights of stairs. The restaurant is nice enough, the servers are all very pleasant and I might try it again if I was having dinner with a few other people and didn't have to eat off a set menu."}
{"text":"Today is the first day of the Summerlicious. Rosewater really impressed me. I always came here for drinks but never tried their actual food. Appetizer: Salmon and shrimp.  Pan-seared salmon with some light creamy sauce was cooked beautifully. As appetizer, the salmon size was bigger than I thought. Peach salad as well as mushroom soup were not too bad. But it was just peach salad and soup.   Main: Definitely go with Bass.  The skin of the bass was crispy while the actual fish meat was soft. The fish itself was melting in my mouth. Garnish was the perfect balance with the fish. I love the beacon bits in the garnish.  Since I had salmon for appetizer, I felt very creamy and fat after eating half of the bass. I guess that was because they used lots of butter when cooking fish as expected. However, I still finished my plate. The sauce was so good that my frd dipped the bread into the leftover sauce.  It was very impressive dish.   The ravioli was not too good. Some of my friends found the skin was thick and there was weird sweet taste.   Dessert: Dessert was good but not excellent compared to the first two courses Lemon tart was chilled and tasted like icecream but it was a bit sour. The black forest cake and the ice-cream was okay as well.  Well, the food in Rosewater was far beyond my expectation. I guess as long as you ordered the right food, you will not be disappointed.   I went at least 3-4 restaurants every summerlicious/winterlicious. I must say this was one of the best summerlicious/winterlicious experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"Tried the Summerlicious menu, and although I hear it is the same every year, the descriptions are vague.  The mushroom cappacino?  The waiter just said, \"oh you wanted the soup.\"  Err and then I ordered the solders, thinking it might be a steak frites deal, but instead it was just a burger slider deal.  The food was either extremely salty (the fries) or completely bland (the soup, peach crumble).  Maybe I just picked the wrong permutation, I'd probably go back and try the other ones, but for the Summerlicious $20, I don't know if it justified the price."}
{"text":"I came here with my family (a party of 4 altogether) this past winter for Winterlicious.  Upon entering the restaurant, we left our coats at the coat check (which was pretty new for me because I'd never gone to a high end restaurant before) and were promptly led to our table (you have to have a reservation,  as with all 'licious events). The servers were attentive and not at all snooty as we asked questions about the menu. The entire place was clean, very comfortable, and the noise level was not too loud.  I can't remember what we had as appetizers but I had the gorgonzola and mushroom linguine and the other 3 people I was with had the flank steak and frites, served with a coleslaw on the side. The gorgonzola sauce was creamy and luxurious, though a bit too heavy (enough that I felt sufficiently full several hours after I had finished the meal) and the steak was perfectly cooked. Afterwards, I had a coconut panna cotta for dessert (a bit too firm for my taste) and my sis had the trio of sorbets (which was okay, but not spectacular).  Overall, we had a very enjoyable experience and everyone in my family agrees that this was the best 'licious experience we're had so far! :D"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. I had to flag a manager to find our water. Even flagging the manager was a challenge. What makes it worse was the food was not good. Seared duck ordered medium was dry/well-done; skin was soggy... reminded me of Chinese BBQ duck at a food court. Seared scallops were cold in the middle. Would definitely not return.  No wonder the place was dead for a Saturday night at 9 pm.  *Not a Winterlicious meal"}
{"text":"Summerlicious Dinner : 2017 *no pics because I was too hungry*  Starting off, pictures can't describe how elegant and beautiful this restaurant is, from the high and elegant ceilings to the amazing seating near the walls and the large windows. Classy, elegant and timeless. Dinner for summerlicious is $38 and it is an amazing meal, here are the thoughts for what we ordered.  Appetizer: Scallop with pork belly, Halifax snow crab arrancini: the scallops were tender cooked to perfection and seasoned with a delightful sauce. My partner had the arrancini which was good although a bit on the heavier side. Main: Dual veal, veal and veal raviolis: looks small on the plate but very filling! The veal was tender, flavorful and the raviolis were fresh and filled with meat, soooo goooooddd Dessert; white chocolate panna cotta: Delicately sweet and wonderfully smooth, with an amazing sauce that tasted of toffee, delicious!!!  If you want to impress someone, for the food ambiance and setting, this place is a stunner. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I attended Rosewater for dinner on a Saturday night last year and I was not impressed. What makes this a Supper Club as opposed to a restaurant with a bar? I have no idea. Maybe so their customers can tell their friends on Monday they went to \"the Supper Club\".   At first it comes off as a legitimate fine dining establishment but by the end of the night it is plainly obvious everything is manufactured to be just so. It seems as though someone picked up \"Trendy Restaurants for Dummies\" and ran with every idea in the book.  Throughout the evening I was constantly coming to realizations about the reality of what this place really was.   When I made the reservation I thought it sounded like a true fine dining experience. Then when I got there I realized, like everywhere else in the club district, it attracts those not necessarily interested in fine-dining so much as seeing and being seen.  When I spoke to the hostess when we walked in I got that unmistakable downtown Toronto attitude that so many young women seem to have in the restaurant/bar business. It must be written right into the job description.   When the waiter came is was apparent we were going to get that wonderful nonchalant service for which so many Toronto waiters are famous. Is it too much to ask for a waiter to appear attentive or even remotely interested in providing a fulsome dining experience? Apparently so.  When the food came I was more impressed with it than the service, but that isn't saying much. It was nothing horrible and nothing special. Middle of the road in every sense.  To be fair, I believe many of these things can be explained by the simple fact that they don't attract (or want to attract) customers that care. Since it is blatantly apparent most of the customers are folks with money but lacking in taste and refinement (mostly young Bay streeters and/or children of wealthly parents) they don't know that where they're eating is just a bunch of bastardized elements of better restaurants jammed into one place. The waiters probably give attitude because they get it from these kind of customers. The food probably isn't that good because their customers don't know good food.   None of these things matter because the kind of people it would matter to don't eat there. Why spend time on the food and wine menu when the most important thing your customers care about it the mixed drink menu?  The customer is always right and indeed they have spoken and Rosewater has listened. If the market demands no truly fine-dining establishments how can I expect the market to supply them? So how can I fault them? I can't. But I still will, because with a location like this with such grand architecture (the inside really is beautiful) they almost have a social responsibility to establish a proper restaurant and not just a place to grab a bite and some drinks before going to the club."}
{"text":"#30daysofyelp A longtime Toronto establishment, I finally got to try when I was invited to a birthday party.  A group of 20 of us, got the majority of the 2nd floor at a long table.  There were also a few other conference room looking dining spaces, and some small tables with couples.   The place is huge, and reminds of of Liberty Grand (same owners) with its vaulting ceilings, and fancy crown moldings.  Its a place to come if you want to impress.   Food, we had a set menu set up for the event. Had a Pear Arugula and Roasted Beet salad which was very good. The flavours melded all together nicely with the sweetness of the pear.  For the main, I had the steak. It was flavourful, and came with some tastey vegetables. I did ask for medium and everyone got medium rare. They didn't even try.   For dessert, an elaborate plate of sorbets and chocolate cake which wans't special , but still good.   The service was attentive and friendly. Our water was never empty and the food was timely.   I do look forward to coming here again and trying their regular menu.  The only thing that bothered me was the loud bass thumping of the club type music they had as background music. It might the only reason I may not bring my parents here because they don't care for that kind of thing. Nor would I come here for a special occasion because there are many other restaurants to try in the city with more character.   At the same time, seems like a really nice place to hold a group function, or a bridal shower, birthday party etc. There's also a nice white room downstairs for private dining (different decor than the rest of the place)."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The ambience was quite elegant. The booth seats really stood out as it was quite tall. Though we came as a group of 4, I think it would be quite nice for a party as I saw individually sectored rooms. We tried the summerlicous menu. Everything was very well seasoned and beautifully plated. The duck breast was cooked to medium and topped with a vinegrette to balance it."}
{"text":"Like many others, I came here recently for lunch during Winterlicious with a large group (party of 6). We selected this restaurant as it was convenient and easy to make a last minute reservation online. Overall I would rate Rosewater a 3.5/5  Food: Almond Crusted Shrimp 2/5 - There was no evidence of almond in the dish at all. I felt the name was quite misleading. The description did mention \"golden raisins\" which held true as my dish was just 3 shrimp and a scatter of raisins.  48 Hour Slow Braised Short Rib 3/5 - it was good. No complaints  Sticky Toffee Pudding 5/5 - the dessert was delicious. I could have ate a second plate. I had some of the homemade sorbet which was also great  Service: 3.5/5 The staff were friendly and we were greeted right away when we entered the restaurant. Also worthy of mention was the free coat check. Our server was friendly but service was very slow which was not our server's fault. It was evident the restaurant was understaffed as the restaurant was completely full and there wasn't a single empty table."}
{"text":"Came here for my bridal shower dinner with 7 other girls. Restaurant was practically empty at 7pm on a Saturday night.. not a good sign... but I thought ok, at least the service will be fast and it's like we have the whole restaurant to ourselves. Nope I was wrong, our mains took forever to come (waited over 40 mins), no one came to check in on us either while waiting. I finally got fed up and inquired about the status of our food, the manager proceeded to come out and explain there were a wedding and some other private functions going on that night and the kitchen was having issues... he also offered us free desserts, ok apologies accepted, cant stay mad over free food right?? except.... we waited another 30+ mins for our desserts, WTH... its dessert, frozen sorbets, cheesecakes and key lime pie, which I could only assume have been pre-made and ready to serve, why would it take so long??? Anyway if they didn't offer free dessert for the whole table I would have given them 1/5.   The food itself was also not worth coming back for. I had the chicken pasta with pesto sauce, nothing special. A couple of girls had steak and remarked the consistency was off, they all ordered medium rare, but some were more medium and others."}
{"text":"I have to say, I am very disappointed with my experience here last night. I came here with my girlfriends for their Winterlicious menu. When I walked in, the ambiance of the restaurant was very nice. But as our time there progressed, the experience got bad to worse. Don't get me wrong, I am not one of those people that expect the server to wait on our table all the time.   As I said, the restaurant decor, setting, and overall ambiance was good. I particularly like the high ceilings and the seating in the dinning area - very spacious and comfortable. The food, I have to say, is only average. It was a Winterlicious menu so I ordered the Shrimp dish for an appetizer, I ordered the beef and short rib dish as the main course, and I ordered the chocolate tart as the desert. The Shrimp and the chocolate tart was good, but my main course was not. The beef was tough, it was too well done. The short rib was okay but not enough sauce. Overall the food was just average.   The service is definitely not en par with other restaurants of this caliber! We all ordered drinks, the drinks didn't really come - I had to ask another server (the the one that was serving us, because I could not locate our server) to check on the drinks. I mean, benefit of the doubt, they were all busy so I'll be more patient. But the service got from bad to worse. Why I say this? Several points why it got from bad to worse - (1) our server was absent most of the time, we had to constantly look for him. He didn't even come to fill our water glasses. (2) They are fast to clear your table, but extremely slow to serve you your food. (3) The people working there, I honestly, don't think they communicate with each other at all. Why I say this? We asked for the bill and our server bought us the bill. He didn't ask us whether we wanted separate bills. He didn't come back with the credit card machine, so again we had to look for another server to ask for the machine. But the lady we got, she didn't really listen to our request. She brought us the bill again instead of the machine. Because it was not separate bills we had to calculate our own portion to pay.   In conclusion, I am very disappointed with the experience. I don't think I would come back any time soon."}
{"text":"2.5*   Summerlicious as a whole gets mixed reviews from me - I've had fabulous experiences and I've had some mediocre ones. Unfortunately, Rosewater falls into the latter category.   I came here for a weekday Summerlicious lunch in a party of 4. The restaurant is decorated elegantly, and the downstairs dining area is beautiful with high backed chairs and ample natural lighting. The upstairs dining area is dark and cozy, more suited towards intimate dinners rather than a friendly lunch. While we weren't pleased with how dark it was since it made it hard to take pictures, turns out it didn't matter since the food wasn't presented that nicely anyways.   Appetizer: 2 pan seared scallops + 1 piece seared pork belly. Mustard based sauce and a pea puree. App came out room temperature, barely warm. Scallops and pork belly tasted good with the sauce and puree, but were arranged in an unfortunately phallic manner (2 round scallops + an oblong piece of meat...use your imagination folks). I've seen pictures of this dish before and there seems to be a glaring inconsistency in terms of plating.   Entree: Duck breast confit (they ran out of duck leg) with green beans and polenta. Duck breast was fine, went well with the fruity sauce. Polenta was not warm and creamy like expected. Each plate of duck was garnished with 2 raspberries and a carnation - my carnation was a sad, small pink bud that I almost mistook for a random piece of pink fish. The raspberries seemed very out of place on the plate, almost like they just threw them on last minute, haphazardly.    Dessert: White chocolate panna cotta - this was the winner. I liked how it was a firmer consistency than some other panna cottas I've had in the past. Flavour was spot on.  Service: Very friendly, but offered us freshly ground black pepper when we were half way through our apps and entrees. Weird timing.   Overall, I'm glad I paid $23 for lunch and not $38 for dinner. I would have been pretty displeased otherwise."}
{"text":"If you didn't know, Tuesday is the new Thursday. They have the same specials without the crowds. Depending on what you like, you can consider this as a alternative albeit earlier in the week. If you like a quiet evening with friends at a classy place, you gotta come try it out.  The bartender is the same as Thursday but she has time to breathe and have a good conversation. She recommended a few drinks and was extremely patient with us considering we were a large group. Some of us arrived early in case the best seats in the house were taken. It was probably after the long weekend but we were able to get those seats no problem. The booths were also still available as well as the couches at the back.  They do not take reservations for the bar area but if you wish, you need to call ahead and there is a minimum charge to be seated in a private room upstairs with your own dedicated server. The upstairs area is not open on Tuesdays as opposed to Thursdays, you are welcome to sit upstairs as it is the most crowded day of the week.  I will probably return on a Tuesday to get great service in a chill atmosphere. Although the service on Thursdays is good, it may be difficult to get a table and you will need to make your way to the crowded bar as the bartenders try to service everyone as quickly as possible.  I never tried to the food but may order some snacks next time."}
{"text":"The design of the restaurant is a bit dated, but the high ceilings with the designs are interesting (made me think of the sistine chapel). I ordered lobster ravioli, cornish hen (main) and creme brule. The lobster ravioli with truffle butter was great. I'm glad I ordered it. The earthiness of the truffle goes well with the ravioli and lobster (I'd say this is quite a generous portion of lobster in the ravioli). I didn't like the cornish hen too much, I almost think I could have done better cooking it myself. The creme brule was bad and I regret ordering it. I would come back for the lobster ravioli. I think this restaurant would be OK if you stick to ordering Italian food and the decor could also be great if updated."}
{"text":"Honestly a worse experience that I expected.  Maybe I expected too much.  Maybe my Asian friends hyped it too much.  Either way, I left sober and not really willing to come back.  I think I went on a bad day because everyone was really young - there were people ending their co-op terms, I swear. Awkward, freshly legal children spilling drinks on our shoes and there were people that were stumbling around drunk - I don't come on thursdays to get hammered, I want a few after work drinks. The bathroom was filled with red-faced asians taking it up, taking selfies. No thank you. I felt like I was at easy and the fifth, with no music.  The place itself is very nice and pretty glamorous. Floors are nice, high ceilings. 3 floors. It's real bougie. Drinks are cheap and not watered down - got 1 sangria, 1 red wine, 2 rum and cokes for $20. Their food is pricey but super good too. The bombay trio is bomb. (only had the samosas but they were bomb)  Rosewater is like that pretty girl that's absolutely rotten inside."}
{"text":"I am so excited I am the first to review Rosewater. This place is absolutely gorgeous. The main dining room is beautiful - 22 foot ceiling, hand painted moldings and hardwood floors and huge windows. The restaurant also features an upper mezzanine and a supper club on the lower level.  There's a real feeling of romance and history in the Rosewater - every time I'm here I feel like royalty.  I went for a friend's birthday during Summerlicious and the food was to die for. I started with a tomato and basil salad which was deliciously refreshing. For my main course I had the salmon with rice and vegetables and it was delicious - a healthy portion and cooked to tender, flaky perfection. For dessert I had a chocolate cake which was mouth watering and did not last long on my plate. I also had a summer cocktail which was vodka and cranberry and some other fruit juices and it was also very tasty.  Our server was wonderful; he took our picture, brought out a special birthday dessert for our friend and delivered our food quickly. For a fine-dining establishment, the prices are pretty standard. But for just for the decor and ambiance, I would recommend spending your pennies at Rosewater!"}
{"text":"Most memorable feature: Comfy chairs  Came for summerlicious dinner and was blown away by the atmosphere, service, and food.  The summerlicious portions were quite filling and the drinks were on point.  The seating and vibe were spectacular.  The chairs were wonderfully comfy and the food was great value.  Absolutely nothing bad to say about my experience here.  Dishes ordered: Halifax snow crab, Seared diver scallop, Duo veal, Orange and honey glazed duck, White chocolate panna cotta, Laurenssen farm strawberries"}
{"text":"A totally disappointing experience..Looking back not sure why I chose to go there with my friends...  I guess we wanted to try something new and also after reading the positive reviews online on Google for the licious events, I figured should be good?  Man were we wrong...  Came here for Summerlicious (maybe a different experience for others?).. Asked to sit downstairs. There was a divided section separated by a wall of roses at the front of the restaurant.... Wish we could have sat in that section instead as it looked nice and also they had round tables (my preference) with nice looking table cover.  Food was just BLEH A OK average.. portions were decent but the food didn't taste great.. The fish we had was so small, smaller than a fish dish we had at another restaurant for lunch! The Asian ratatouille that came with the fish tasted awful. The chicken looked quite dry and the lamb shank lacked of sauce.... The breads given were not fresh...(more like half a day's old). The scallops appetizer was likely the best dish of the night but it only had two scallops..and the dish looked funny with a chip in the middle of the dish (talk about degrading the presentation of the dish).. The duck prosciutto appetizer was oversalted... Rosewater needs to work on the presentation of their dishes & drinks if they would like to keep their reputation or past reputation...even the slice of banana had its skin on still in our Martini drinks YUCK!   Desserts was terribly disappointing..... nothing special but was told from a friend that came on the week-end that the desserts were different and tasted good.  In regards to service, our waitress was hardly serving us.. The busboys who brought us bread and extra dishes/cutlery gave us a much better service than she did.... Our waitress didn't even bother checking up on us on whether our food was ok... except when when we were almost finished.. She was too busy buttering the table next to us to work on her tip. Only once DID she served us water without us asking for it, and that was at the end when we asked for our bill! Also, the funny thing is when I asked her for the bill, she pretty much took the salt shaker off our table immediately... not sure if she thought we were going to steal it!   As the night got busier, the dishes took longer to come out for many tables... Thank goodness we were there early or else we would be so starving waiting for a long time for the food to come out..even heard a table complained when their food was finally brought out. Felt very sorry for the other tables who had to wait so long for dishes that tasted mediocre at best.   Rosewater had a lot of stars visiting their restaurant for the TIFF festivals but not since 2005. This used to be the IT place to see many Hollywood A List stars that is something of a past now.  Rosewater still have a long standing reputation but if they keep going in the path of mediocre food and drinks, I am afraid business will start going down.. Was surprised to see the place so busy that evening.   For the same price, I suggest to stick with well known restaurants such as Jump or Annona where you are guaranteed for a fabulous meal and fantastic service.....or for a little more, stick with high end restaurants."}
{"text":"2.5 stars **  Rosewater presents itself as an upscale fine dining experience. The interior is spacious, ringing with elegant, modern, and chic design. It is a great place for venues or private functions.  Bread came around with different selections (Tonight's selections were black olive, whole wheat, flat, and French baguette)  Ordered:  Appetizers: Seared Scallops with Baby Spinach Risotto - The risotto was creamy and tasty. Along with the scallops that was seared and cooked to perfection. A pleasant appetizer to start.  Mains: Pan seared Quebec Duck Breast with Yukon Potato Rosti - Came with caramelized grapes. I felt the combination of flavours didn't work well with each other, as there was too many things going on at once. The potato rosti was was very delicious. The duck breast was prepared medium rare and tasted quite savoury for the first few bites, but when cooled, it was tough to chew through.   Sterling Silver Striploin Steak with Truffle Butter Baked Potato - Cooked and prepared as ordered - Medium Rare. The steak itself was flavourful, with a nice sear on the outside. There are some areas that was difficult to chew, as you know it is not the best cut.    Dessert: Belgium Chocolate Molten Cake with Ice Cream - One of the more disappointing meals of the evening. The molten cake itself did not impress me, as it tasted like any other standard chocolate cakes I've had. Though, it did work well with the caramel ice cream and burnt sugar. But then again, how can you go wrong with cake and ice cream?  Overall, the food is uninspiring and lacking that wow-factor at the price point that you're paying. Bill came to $120 for two.  Service was excellent and spot on, checking up on us at least once for every new dish that arrived.   If it weren't for that $50 gift certificate that I received, I wouldn't have come here to try. Gave it a shot, but will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome decor! This is the perfect place to unwind after a long day working in the Toronto core, plus the $3 dollar happy hour drinks don't hurt! It was packed so getting a place at the bar will be difficult unless you're willing to be aggressive and push your way to the front. If you're looking to hang out with friends with cheap drinks and have a few laughs this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Great experience in one of torontos hottest dining venues. This place isn't usually opened for lunch, except during winter and summerlicious.  Rosewater's exhibits the upper echelons of dining experience with its decor, and service. Not only does this place host corporate, and private events, but weddings, other special occasions. Here's the scoop on the 2014 Winterlicious experience:  Applewood Smoked Duck Breast Salad 4.5/5 You could taste the smoky flavors of the duck breast, complimented by the fresh salad.  In addition the small green lentils create a neutral balance to the overall dish/  Ricotta Gnocchi 5/5 made with Gorgonzola Cream, Pear, Walnuts, Arugula, the pears add a smooth, yet partially sweet balance to the rich cream and gnocchi.  Definitely something to try!  Warm Pecan Bread Pudding: 4/5 okay, im a fan of bread pudding, this was delighful, the toffee, maple syrup was not too over powering, the bread pudding almost tasted like french toast.  Overall this place is quite beautiful inside, and the servers are extremely polite!"}
{"text":"I went to a TIFF ET party and received a $50 gift certificate to Rosewater. So we used it last week. This place is so amazing. I made a reservation online and everything ran smooth when we got there. The hostess took our jackets and hung them up and escorted us to our table. Now the place is a good size, but what you don't see are the other rooms they have. Rosewater has 5 rooms. I wish got to see them all. This is a classy place, so don't show up in jeans and a T or your going to feel like an idiot The service was really good. there was a guy always coming around with fresh bread. Our server was really nice and attentative. The decor was what i liked the most. Very well thought out and interesting. It was very intimate. I couldn't really hear the other tables around us which is always nice when your having a romantic dinner lol . Its expensive but its worth it. The food is sooo good. My bf got cornish hen....it was ridiculous. I got salmon and it was really good also, but i wish i got the hen. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"We were here last night for out belated V-Day dinner.  I had a pretty nice meal, we started with the crispy calamari salad (it had an interesting texture - with spring greens, some bitter greens, bananas) - overall pretty tasty.  I ordered the seared tuna - pretty delish, the veggies were a bit on a salty side (but I generally find a ton stuff kind of salty).  My bf ordered the steak, which was a done quite well also.    I love the decor!  It's pretty quiet on Friday nights, so super great to have a nice romantic dinner and enjoy your date's company!  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was just at Rosewater for my friend's engagement party and I was just amazed by the architecture and interior design of this venue.  It is decked out in shades of off-pink tones and provides a warm feeling with the sunlight peeking through its very tall windows. It also uses marble, large pillars with carved designs and fountains to create a really relaxing and classy atmosphere.  On top of that, they have a room downstairs near the restrooms that resembles an old school social meeting room or scotch bar.  I haven't been to Rosewater for a meal but for the appetizers and food I had at this party, I left completely satisfied and thought about the interesting ways they made up the food - yogurt smoothies in shot glasses, fresh juices all over the place and yummy mini belgian waffles.  Overall, this is a great place for a private function and I am sure amazing for a night out!"}
{"text":"I came here last year for a prix-fixe valentine's dinner.  It is a very gorgeous restaurant.  Very spacious and beautiful interior.  I was surprised with a rose on my side of our table when I realised a rose was not available on others.  It was my bf who requested the restaurant prepare a rose for me, but the restaurant was so nice and did it for us complimentarily.   The food there was good.  The dessert was beautiful and tasty.  The ambiance and the excellent service made our dinner especially amazing."}
{"text":"Impeccable service and excellent mains. The roasted potatoes are amazing. Lots of attention to detail. Keep an eye out for 1,000 point OpenTable times (usually around when they first open). If you're looking for a place to suit up and hit a bar and look like you belong there in a suit, the Rosewater is your home. Knocking them back a star because if you go on a Saturday they host weddings on the top floor. It can be loud."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Ordered the onion soup for the appetizer: The onion soup was really good! It came with molten brie fondue on the side to add into the soup - it was really smooth and flavorful.   Moroccan grilled lamb chops for the main: Didn't like this at all. It came with couscous on the side which had a really weird flavour to it - the couscous was pretty dry too. I barely ate any - only had the lamb and the veggies.   Service was great. We had 3 servers serving our table of 4 lol!  One thing rosewater needs to improve on is their silverware! We were all given \"sharper knives\" to cut our mains - like the lamb chop I ordered, others ordered the strip loin steak etc. It was definitely not sharp enough. We had so much trouble cutting the meat hahaha.."}
{"text":"I went here thinking it was a supper club, unfortunately it is not. The food was very bland and overpriced for what we received. I ordered pork and noodles, and it was OK, but was not good.   The vibe in the place was not as it is in other Liberty places, it was very quiet and quite boring. The drink and wine menu were average.   I was told that Thursdays are a better night to go, but after my last experience I dont plan on going again any time soon."}
{"text":"One of Toronto's oldest establishment. Says a lot because up until a couple years ago the food scene in Toronto sucked and this preserves that reputation fully. Lobster ravioli with bacon? Sounds good, tastes awful. Scallops with spinach risotto? Two tiny subpar scallops on some tasteless cheesy rice? Yup. Good looking place but subpar food. Yes, just like every restaurant in the Bay street vicinity. Save your money and go to the food court."}
{"text":"During happy hour, Rosewater is a hot spot for business professionals in the downtown core. The average person dresses business casual when visiting this establishment. I would definitely recommend coming to this place right after business hours if you are here during those times. The happy hour drink specials are wonderful because the drinks cost around $3.50 - $5. Be warned though that there are no servers, and only table bussers. You will have to go to the bar to get your drinks. The wait can be a little long so I suggest buying your drinks in pairs or making them doubles or triples. The place needs to improve on their transaction flow, as the customers waste quite a bit of time waiting around. Check it out and mingle with business professionals. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"I was a bridesmaid for a wedding held at Rosewater in December 2016, and this review is solely based on that experience. Overall, Rosewater was a wonderful vendor to deal with, and the bride and groom were more than happy to sing their praises. We were very impressed by the professionalism of all staff and servers, by their efficiency, and overall, by the way they handled this special event. Here's a summary:  Space: Rosewater has an upstairs space that comfortably accommodates around 150 guests (or more, depending on your setup). The space is classy and elegant. The standard decor was ornate without going overboard. A really nice, comfortable area to host a mid-sized crowd.   Space Restrictions: Perhaps a minor complaint is that the bridal suite is pretty small (fitting more than 5 to 6 bodies in there was quite the squeeze). As well, there weren't many bathroom stalls, so there was inevitably a lineup for the bathrooms all evening.   Food: The food was made of good quality ingredients, and was quite tasty. It certainly isn't a meal that can knock your socks off, but for a set meal at a wedding, catering to a variety of taste palates, Rosewater did a great job. The food came out in a timely manner, and wedding guests weren't left waiting long, godforsaken amounts of time just to eat dinner. The servers were super friendly, professional, and efficient.   Service: As mentioned, Rosewater was responsive, professional and organized. If you choose to have your wedding here, know that Rosewater is a seasoned vendor with experience planning large events, but are, additionally, attentive to your requests.  Overall,the bride and groom found Rosewater to be a responsive, reliable vendor to deal with as they planned their wedding. Which is certainly a good sign for those looking at Rosewater space for both special personal and professional events."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious, we arrived at 11 for our reservation at 11:30.  We were impressed by the interior design, my friend took a lot of pictures  I had the:  Applewood Smoked Duck Breast Salad (3/5)  Not really a fan of lentils, but the duck breast did taste good with it  Ricotta Gnocchi (5/5) It was amaaazing, the cream was just lovely  Flourless Chocolate Cake (4/5) I normally don't like banana but it went really well with the chocolate.  It was just a tad too sweet for my taste   My friends had the homespun sorbet and liked it, but found it overly sweet.  She also mentioned that the blueberry flavoured one tasted slightly like shaved ice  The servers were really nice and we found the place beautiful"}
{"text":"Went to Rosewater for my friend's birthday. Interior was large and airy (high ceilings!)  Service was absolutely fantastic. Extremely courteous and professional which is always very appreciated for large groups. The majority of my reasoning for the 4 stars goes to the service.  They give you a beautiful variety of breads to start your meal off with and a delicious salted whipped butter   Food was hit or miss. For mains I got the PROSCIUTTO & FROMAGGIO ($19) cause I wasn't too hungry. It was served on a stone cold platter and was beautiful to look at but mediocre in taste. I am too spoiled from having cured meat platters from the likes of Black Hoof and Bar Isabel!  My boyfriend got the LOBSTER RAVIOLI ($28 for main size) and it was quite tasty. However, it was a little too salty for my liking. The lobster flavour was very prominent and I actually quite liked the dish.. if only they toned the salt down a little bit  FYI: plating fees for cakes are $4 a plate! Better off eating the cake at someone's place if you have a large group!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly. Atmosphere good.  Kitchen was quite slow.  Food was decent but the wait being so long we were so hungry we didn't really appreciate it perhaps.  Dessert was quite good."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious with a friend and we split everything. To start, we had the iceberg carpaccio and she had the pea and mascarpone ravioli. The iceberg was good except the dressing was a little watery, plenty of avocado and bacon and the bleu cheese was perfect, not too strong. I preferred the ravioli, the sauce was subtle and the stuffing was really good. For mains, we had the steak frites and the pan roasted duck breast. Highly recommend the duck breast, it was moist and tender and it came with a salad and potatoes and asparagus. My friend loved this as well. We ordered the steak medium well and it was overcooked and the fries were a little cold but the duck was definitely worth it. For dessert, we had the peaches and the peanut butter and jelly. My friend preferred the peaches which came with a graham cracker crumble and whipped cream, I preferred the peanut butter graham cracker layered with jelly mascarpone and topped with chocolate and caramel sauce. Overall, great restaurant, great venue and surprisingly not busy!"}
{"text":"It was my second visit to rosewater. I came to have lunch with 3 friends for Winterlicious. We were seated on the second floor dining area. For those of you that haven't been here before, it is a large space. It was dimly lit yet you can still tell that the place was dated.   I started with the Applewood Smoked Duck Breast Salad with Dupuy Lentils, Confit, and Crisp Bacon.  It was a good salad but there was room for improvement. The dressing needs more of a kick in the form of acidity. The lentils didn't add any value in terms of taste. The bacon wasn't crispy.   For the main I chose the Pan-Seared Ontario Rainbow Trout Beet Risotto, Grilled Asparagus, Pommery Mustard and Champagne Beurre Blanc.  The fish was cooked perfectly. I only wish they had a crispy skin. The risotto was nice and creamy just the way I like it.  I would have liked a few pieces of beets.    To finish off I had the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Rum-Flamed Bananas, Chocolate Chunk Ice Cream. The cake was pretty much a molten lava cake. It was soft, crunchy and creamy all at the same time. That's never a bad thing :-D.  With the ice cream it worked well being that it had both hot and cold components. If you're a chocolate lover (such as myself) you would live this dish.   It was fairly busy for their lunch service. The service itself was pretty good. There was minimal wait time in between courses. I Will mention that the bread they served was cold. It's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Located in the financial district Rosewater is great place to stop by on a Thursday night for $3 happy hour drinks! It opens at 5:30pm but got there at around 6pm and the place was pretty packed already - both upstairs and downstairs and with line ups out the door. Not many seats and tables available to just sit down but nice interior and decor in general. Bartenders were friendly, crowd is nice, gets pretty loud and is mainly business casual. Due to the number of people you will probably end up waiting longer than usual in line for drinks though. I still have yet to try the food but have heard great things so would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I've been to Rosewater once for winterlicious and once for summerlicious.  Both times there were things that I really liked and things that I really did not like.  I'm going to comment mainly on my recent winterlicious experience.  The service was really really good, and that is one of the reasons why I gave this review 3 stars... or else it would have been 2 stars.  The hostess was friendly, the waiter even offered to check up on our friends who were smoking outside.  The venue was nice, but the food was not up to par.  The only thing I liked about my meal was the crab cake appetizer, the dinner and even dessert flopped.  My dinner was tuna that was \"rare\", but really it should have been labeled raw.  It was just like a huge slab of tuna sashimi that was warm because it was sitting on warm vegetables.   My friends got the beef dish and they left the fat on it and they didn't enjoy that either. The dessert was some chocolate cherry thing, but I didn't see any cherry... I think they ran out and used strawberry instead or maybe the cherry was hidden in the sauce.  It was hard on the outside and doughy in the inside.  The inside tasted like cooked flour with chocolate flavouring.  Very disappointed.  Just a warning for those coming here for the winterlicious event."}
{"text":"Our company host our annual Christmas party here and I was really excited to go because I have only heard of good things about this restaurant and about the famous chef this restaurant belongs too. I have to say..I'm it a big fan and the quality of the food was ok. We had the following appetizers, duck wrap, Caesar salad in a bird's nest style, tandoori chicken and spring rolls. And for the main it was steak, chicken and fish. I like my steak well-done and  I know..I know...I've heard it many times before \"why have steak if your going to have it well-done\"..but hey..I like what I like and how I like it! :) I wish I choose the chicken or salmon instead because I didn't get my steak the way I want it nor did it come out hot.  For dessert the creme brule was served. That was disappointing also because my creme brule come out incomplete..the dessert includes fruits and a biscotti cookie like. Unfortunately, my creme brule was not scorch on top,  again.. disappointing  and no fruit topping but I did get the biscotti cookie like. Some desserts were serve complete and other were missing the cookies or the fruits. :(  Overall..the place is nice and posh, clean, parking is  limited, expensive as expected and quality was poor. I would not go back but I'm glad I got to experience a high-end dinning."}
{"text":"Elegant crown molding, pink marble, cool use of glass to enclose rooms-- the atmosphere is nice. Almost Starck-ish with the Alice in Wonderland tall booths.  We had the Winterliscious menu. Excellent Valpolicella and Sauvignon Blanc wines by the glass., but the food disapointed.   Tender grilled calamari starter was nice, but lobster bisque was beyond bland.   Chicken was so dry that my roots of my teeth ached from unclenching my jaw.  Chocolate chunk creme brulee was sooo decadent during consumption, but caused sugary tummy ache up until this morning.   Such a shame that the gorgeous interior defeats the food quality."}
{"text":"I received a $ 50 gift certificate from yoga in motion for this particular restaurant & decided to come here w/ my bf. Overall, we had a wonderful & romantic evening. The décor & ambiance was very BEAUTIFUL (please see photos). The food was absolutely AMAZING. Before coming to the restaurant I was afraid we would have to hang out at McDonalds as it's noted to have small portions. However, Rosewater filled us just right & we left very satisfied. We ordered...   Seared Scallops - Potato & pancetta risotto, corn & truffle foam $17 The sauce was heavenly & very rich. Scallop was just perfect as well Funny we were going to order the smoked salmon but because the scallopS (note the plural) we assumed there would be two ...one for each of us ;) It was one of the best appetizer I've had.  Wild Mushroom Risotto - Dungeness crab, truffle essence $28 We both ordered the risotto. Very cheesy & tasty! I've never eaten so slow before...but that's because I wanted to savour every spoonful!   Classic Vanilla Bean Crème Brûlée with Earl Grey Scented Ice Cream & Scottish Oat Cake $9 Definitely one of the best crème brulee's I've ever had!! My bf usually only eats about 25% of the dessert if we're sharing but this time he really took his 50% share! Bugger!  Service here was excellent. They always checked on us to see if we needed anything & filled our water. Although in the beginning we thought the waiter would be a problem as my bf ordered water & the waiter was like water? sure! Nearly walking away w/o asking me what I had wanted....a sprite :D We just don't like paying for overpriced alcoholic beverages.  Would love to come back one day especially for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Rosewater is ok.  I've been for a wedding, for dinner, for a corporate event and for a film festival party.  all in all, i like the space. I think it's fun to drink there. I especially like the private dinning rooms downstairs.  But to be honest, everytime i've eaten here, i've been disappointed. Essentially, they do the staples really well  - steaks, lamb, salmon, etc. What they can't do well is anything that requires a little bit of skill - the foie, the rissotto, taglia telle, etc.   I'd go here for a party, but i would not spend money here on dinner. I just don't feel it's fully worth it."}
{"text":"We chose the Rosewater Room to host our December 2016 wedding and this review reflects our experience in the months leading up to the wedding and the actual day.  I will note that the venue changed coordinators part of the way through the year leading up to my wedding, so while coordinator 1 was on board with all of the things I wanted, I don't think that an appropriate hand off meeting was held for coordinator 2. A few things were missed that, in retrospect, aren't a big deal, but that could have been handled better if they had done a hand-off meeting to exchange information.  After our first visit to the Rosewater, we knew that it was the wedding venue for us. The venue itself is beautiful and really doesn't need a lot of extra to make it look fantastic. We ended up renting colored tablecloths and a backdrop for behind the head table, but besides flowers, that was it. We received a ton of compliments about how gorgeous the venue was.  When we went for our first tasting, it was INCREDIBLE. First of all, we had asked to bring extra people as our parents wanted to be at the tasting and the charge for that was just included as part of the package price (they may have added it on but I didn't see it in the bill!). We got full sized portions of everything we tasted and as there was 5 of us, they were able to give us at least 2 of each dish to share and try. We only got 2 or 3 of the mains, but there was honestly so much food, we couldn't eat any more! We chose to go with the Mediterranean option, with an antipasto plate, a pasta course, duo entrees and dessert and late night passed fare. They were more than happy to accommodate my husbands issues with tomato sauce and for no extra charge gave us a rose sauce with parmesan (which I still dream about, its so damned good). All of the food was INCREDIBLE. We were so happy with everything and people are still raving about our wedding and how good the food was. The dessert was some kind of fruit tart with this honey lavender ice cream.... OMG amazing. On the day, the food was JUST as good. Our steaks were all a little overdone but we went over in timing so that's to be expected. The kitchen can only do so much when they're ready to serve and speeches go long.  The venue was super accommodating of my wishes, they were more than happy to set everything up, there were very few restrictions as to how we could decorate and as long as we gave them instructions, they were there to make me happy. A few pieces of decor didn't get put out but I think that was my fault as I didn't label them at all. There was an issue with one of our signs - the glass shattered the morning of the wedding and then the frame itself fell apart. The venue managed to fix it somehow and get it up on display!! :) As well, our donut cake arrived looking like a leaning tower of pisa, but the head table attendant took it upon herself to fix it and she did!! :)  The bar area for cocktail hour is spacious, it was great that most people were able to sit down if needed and it created some nice areas of conversation for our guests. I appreciated that we weren't crammed into a small space like at other venues - it was easy to move about the space to visit with all of our guests. And people really appreciated that they didn't have to go anywhere between the ceremony and reception, just down one flight of stairs (they have an elevator for those who need it) and back up for dinner.  A few little perks - the on-site bridal suite was handy for us to leave our bags and when the card box got full, the cards were moved into the suite. But it's not big enough to get ready in. We were given two keys for the room and I had a private bathroom to use, which was great. We were taking formal photos upstairs and the venue brought up a selection of appetizers for us - I wouldn't have gotten to try any of them otherwise because they were GONE by the time we got downstairs (and we ordered lots, everyone LOVED them). There's a super sweet little outdoor terrace which was a great place to go and cool off on my heavy dress, and a lot of people liked to zip out there for a bit of a break from the music and everything. There are plenty of bathrooms so there may be lines on occasion but they're individual rooms, not stalled bathrooms, which I liked.  I can't recommend this venue enough. The value for money is incredible and the venue itself is absolutely gorgeous and it fit into our budget perfectly. People are still raving about how our wedding was the best one they'd ever been to and how great the food was and how beautiful the venue was."}
{"text":"Came for winterlicious. As soon as we walked in, there was a crowd of people in business casual attire. It actually looked like a pub or a bar at this point, and everyone was socializing loudly. I was confused because I thought this was a restaurant, not a night club. It was probably because we came Thursday night.  We got seated in the corner of the dining room which was really nice. I had potted duck, short ribs and the sorbet for dessert, no complaints. However, one thing was the fact that it felt like just because we were coming for winterlicious, and because my group of friends were ages 21-22, we did not receive the best service. The server did not check up on us at all, and only came to take our order and bill us.  Overall, the food and decor was nice. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the crowded pub-like environment happening for Thursday night, nor was I a fan of the service. Disclaimer: my friends and I are all restaurant workers."}
{"text":"When a friend tells me to get dressed up for a restaurant, it sounds like business. I didn't read much about the Rosewater prior to having a winterlicious dinner- so I was curious as to what I had to dress up for.  The environment of the place was... ok.  The waiter was pretty cool and new his game. Although his co-waiter was an absolute ass- if I can hear you mumble as you walk away from your table and instruct the guy who grinds the pepper to go quicker...you got a pickle up your butt bud. Anyway, our waiter was cool.   I had the: House Smoked Duck Prosciutto served with pomegranate and tangerine salad. ... sooooooooooooo good. Omnom.  Red Wine Braised Lamb Shank Garlic Mash, Roasted Root Cellar Vegetables, Rosemary Aioli ... just as yum. Omnomnom. Great portion too!  Maple Roasted Apple & Raisin Crumble Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Brown Sugar Caramel ....meh... would've lived without it.   We also got the wine tasting to go with our dinner so the overall price for the evening was... a lot.   I'd say I'd go there again during another Winterlicious."}
{"text":"Rosewater is more like a 2.5. We really only went here because we had a gift certificate for $50 so we figured it would be a cheap-ish meal.  It's a gorgeous space with great decor and I could see it being an awesome venue for a private party.   But the food is just really \"meh\". Uninspired menu and with such a high price point - you expect the food to be amazing. But it's not. Appetizers ranged from $14-$20 and mains from $26-$50ish. Ouch. Too spendy for such boring food.  I had the Cornish Hen for $28, it came flattened and served nice and crispy with some grilled asparagus and portobello mushroom. DC had the Blackened Grouper ($32?) which came served with some vegetables and a tiny (3 small pieces) \"dynamite\" roll.   Our server seemed a bit creepy and not too polite at the beginning, but he sorted out his act towards the end.  At least the wine was very reasonably priced - glasses starting from $7. Lots of free bread was brought over (on two separate occasions).   Patrons seemed mostly geriatric. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"3.4  Fancy and classy place but very comfy at the same time. I'd love to be invited at a professional and/or private function dinner there.  Service can be slow and smiling seems optional, even at the front desk where girls in miniskirts have a weird (neglecting) way to greet customers. Better wear snowsuits and be welcoming! Waiters should also be taught that not drinking wine is not a disease and that a customer asking for water refill is a severe fault in service.  Food is just OK, although lamb shack is huge and good (but dry with very little gravy sauce). Like many (almost) good restaurants in Toronto, desserts could (= should) be better to end up with a good note and memory.  Price are OK, based on all the tralala of the place."}
{"text":"Thursday nights are fun and social. I've never had their food here but the kitchen is always on the move and it's always smellin good.   If you've had a crap Thursday at work and could use a cheap drink or 5, and be surrounded by dozens of men in navy suits talking about equity and how their girlfriends hated their Tiffany ring because they wanted Cartier, this is the place to go.  Coat check and bag check is only $1. Highly suggest starting a tab, and grabbing as many drinks as you can hold when you get to the bar. It takes a while to get through all the 6'1 men and women in stilettos."}
{"text":"I've been here for both the industry Thursday nights, and for actual dinner on a random weeknight.   Tuesdays and Thursdays makes this place a bit of a watering hole for Bay street suits. And by watering hole, I mean alkiehawling hole. From 5-8, there's $5 wine, $4 draft beer and $3 mixed drinks! Not too shabby. If you're in the Financial industry, you might want to snazz up a little bit, because you're guaranteed to run into SOMEONE you weren't expecting....a high school not-really-friend, business school rivals, that person you couldn't beat on the debate team way back when. You know. Just random people! Gets old quick though.  All in all, Thursdays are fun and make for an affordable way to get from 0 to drunk before 8pm.   For dinner, I came on a Thursday night as well, just to see how the dining experience is affected by the rowdy financiers. Not bad, actually! I mean, I look through the glass and it looks like a zoo in Suits, but the noise control is decent!  I tried the Lobster Ravioli ($18) and threw in $10 to make it a main. When it came, I was severely underwhelmed. AND I bit into a rather large lobster shell....Nope. Asked the server to replace the dish with another entree altogether, because I lost confidence in it. Replaced my entree with the Beef Tournado au Poivre and this was a great dish! Not know what a \"Tournado\" was, I had few expectations, but it said \"caramelized onions\" and hey! I love me some caramelized onions! This dish was a winner.   Service was perfectly fine. The server very graciously replaced my dish. But that's probably because I picked a more expensive option, hmmmmm!?  So. Dining would be a 3 star thanks to the shell, but industry nights would be a 3.5."}
{"text":"We came to Rosewater on a Friday evening just after it opened for dinner, and the place was less than half full. Some people think that is a bad sign for a restaurant, but for those of us who appreciate civil conversation and recall the days before boisterous noise=\"fantastic dining atmosphere\", this was a welcome first-impression.  We ordered the scallops to start, followed by the duck & confit, salmon & asparagus on beet risotto, followed by lemon tart for dessert.  Scallops were perfectly seared and the lemony risotto that accompanied it was delicious.   Presentation and taste of each dish and their sauces were detailed, varied, and clean, so we can overlook the fact that their risotto was overly-cheesed  (probably because the general populace are stereotypically ra-ra for fromage and bacon and the like). Meat and fish prep were exactly as they said they would do it, and not overdone. They don't boast about their produce being farm-to-table or anything like that, so we had no expectations for exceptional cuts or any pretentious judgements about how their animal/vegetable was fed and treated .   Service was exceptional and attentive, and the waiter was game to play along with my dessert questions even though he most likely never tasted the lemon tart himself.   After a period of observing friends, acquaintances, and distant strangers I've trolled on Facebook, I've come to the conclusion that in many Canadian cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, urbanites and suburbanites tend to have very inflated reactions and expectations whenever they hear the terms \"Summerlicious\", \"Winterlicious\", \"tasting menus\", and \"prix fixe menus\".  Essentially, I think this heightened anticipation for  a prodigious 3-course meal will ultimately leave most diners disappointed because truth of the matter is, there is no substantial difference between ordering a tasting menu versus ordering off the regular menu.  Most hype that comes with these \"foodie festivals\" is the mentality that there is something extra special about a menu set for you by a restaurant, the sense of getting an elegant dining experience for a dime (usually under $35/person), and that you can take your special date out somewhere nice and for once impress him/her without dreading the end-of-night self-agony over your emptied wallet.  Point is, people who did not enjoy Rosewater during an affordable prix fixe menu occasion most likely began with distorted expectations for a relatively low-cost meal at a higher end place."}
{"text":"The space upstairs is actually quite pretty and elegant for events. The layout was nice and open concept with high ceilings and wooden flooring. Service was decent, and the feel of the restaurant was classy without trying too hard. The food was only average though - everything seemed like typical catered banquet food to me. Nothing really stood out and I would probably not come back for dinner.   Might look into the space again if I wanted to host an event or mixer but I can definitely get better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been to Rosewater for about 4 or 5 times now, and always seem to be consistent in terms of quality and service.  One of the those items was actually a work Christmas party a couple of years back, as we rented a party room downstairs which fits good 100ppl if not more. With a pre-set 4 course meal, live dj, it was a great night with great food and nice ambiance. So that's definitely an option if you're looking to book a venue for private/corporate functions.  The main dining room is always has an upper level as well, and their service is always on the A level. Their wine list can get very pricey matching their steaks and menu selections.  Rosewater is ideal for dates, business meetings, or if you're inviting people to impress, this is the spot.  Parking is a little bit hard considering their location, but parking meters are available when they're free."}
{"text":"I visited Rosewater for a winterlicious lunch. The place has three different floors, with a couple of private small dining area which is nice and cozy. Will love to go back for a private party. We were seated on the second level and found the lights to be dark for a lunch. The service was ok; she didn't bother re-filling our water cups.   Appetizer: almond crusted tiger shrimp which wasn't hot at all, but it was fresh and light. Loved the puréed cauliflower which had the finesse of a wonderful mashed potatoes. The display of three shrimps were nicely done.   Main dish: lamb osso bucco agnolotti which are large rounded raviolis. There were only six on a large rectangular plate. Two more would have been nice. It had a nice taste to it. Again, I wished it was hot off the pan/stove. It was filled with shredded lamb meat. Not much veggie as garnish.   Dessert: I tried 2. The sticky toffee pudding was a very small piece but definitely worth every bite. I could eat two more pieces of it!!! Love it!! Then, I had homemade sorbet of three different flavours which were big scoops and love it too. One of the largest portion I've seen of three scoops of sorbet!!   Verdict: the service could be better. The food was delicious but portions could have been bigger (from a girl's point of view). The atmosphere is wonderful and yes I would go back to it for a special occasion!! No regrets of trying it out for $23."}
{"text":"Came here two years in a row (unfortunately) for a Christmas function.  The food was horrible. The plates didn't come with what it had stated on the menu, steak was overcooked, fish smelled rotten.  All around bad.  Two star rating because the service was decent.  I'm pretty sure they served frozen spring rolls."}
{"text":"Attended a charity function.  Nice place, good space.  Only qualm was the food was mediocre, not too sure if it was a separate catering company.  The function was on the second floor, the main floor was their actual resto/bar.  By a peek it looked nice  There service was also good during the event and not sure if it was a separate from the event.  Nice place and will be update when I try the main level."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at the Rosewater and am quite surprised at the amount of negative reviews that are floating around hyperspace regarding this place. Now, I was there on a Saturday night and this may have something to do with the quality of the food that may not be as on the mark on other nights of the week. The ambiance is something worth mentioning as well.  The restaurant is situated on Toronto Street in an older part of the city (one of the areas that hasn't been torn down to make way for shiny new buildings.  The building itself was built in 1906 and the management of the restaurant have done a nice job of maintaining the original old world quality of the interior while adding touches of the modern which combine together nicely.  The walls and ceiling are the original designs while an upper level of wood and glass has been added.  There is also a waterfall running down the wall on the other side of the bar which isn't overdone and yet adds somrthing to the environment.  The restaurant is spacious, open and a nice place to have a meal. Okay, on to the food... The service was great and professional.  Someone always came around to make sure everything was to our liking and yet they were not intrusive.  As soon as the food arrived (appetiser or main) someone was there to offer you freshly ground pepper.  There was a selection of bread that a waiter came around with and served from a tray to begin.  There was a nice selection of breads to suit all tastes from fresh white to whole grain to bread sticks. My starter was the crispy tiger prawns.  They were displayed nicely, but more importantly, they were delicious.  There were about six lightly breaded plump and juicy prawns served on a long plate, in a row.  They were arranged on a bed of orange sauce and a few slices of mandarin oranges.  Green onion was laid overtop of the prawns in a cross pattern.  At one end of the plate was a small serving of small lettuce leaves and at the other end of the long plate was a small serving of caviar.  The flavours of the orange, onion and caviar all complimented the prawns very well and the serving was very generous. For the main course I had the trio of duck (breast, confit and fois gras).  The duck breast was nicely done (I chose to have it medium) and the confit and fois gras were served in a separate dish that was fresh out of the oven (baked).  The breast was covered in a nice cherry jus that didn't overpower the duck but instead enhanced the flavour and complimented it very nicely.  The fois gras was served on a bed of baked mashed potato which made for a delicious combination.  Also on the plate was an assortment of steamed asparagus, baby carrots and shallots.  There were all well cooked and yet maintained there crispness, which is how you want them to be.  The portion was quite generous and my friend and I were very full by the end. The meal was a little pricy but well worth it and at the end my friend and I both said that we would be back again.   This place is worth it for a nice meal out, most defiantly. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Elegant, classy, personable, professional are words i would use to describe my times at Rosewater.  Located in the heart of cosmopolitan downtown, once you enter the restaurant, you will feel like you have been transported back to the old world with its beautiful classical architecture and interior design. Rosewater is my favorite Summerlicious event this summer.  Their menu selections were extensive and interesting, so i decided to give it a try.  For appetizer, i got Seared diver scallop and five spice glazed pork belly summer pea puree, maple mustard seed jus which was divine!  It was hard for me to choose the main as there were so many great dishes to select from, but in the end, I went with Orange and honey glazed duck breast and confit leg soft polenta, Haven Farms bean salad, fig and balsamic jus.  The duck was tender and juicy.  It melted in my mouth without having to deal with a chewy texture that many restaurants struggle with.  Last but not least, I ended the evening with White chocolate panna cotta salted caramel foam, dark chocolate almond brandy snap. Wow!  was it ever amazing! It was not overly sweet; instead, it was soft and creamy.   The service was really good.  Our server was very personable and attentive.  He gave us recommendations and was easy to talk with.  Our food came to us in a timely manner, and he made sure we had everything we needed. Just before we left the restaurant, we found out that happy hour happens every Tues and Thurs.  Select drinks are only $2.75 per glass!!!  So I went back there on a Thursday at 5pm, which was a good time to go because soon afterward, the bar got slammed with happy hour customers, and Rosewater became a trendy destination for downtown professionals who went there to unwind after a day's work.  A nice end to a work day."}
{"text":"My friend and I checked out this supper club on a fine Friday evening. We had a good time, enjoyed the decor, had a decent meal and laughed a lot =)  Location - convenient, lots of street parking and green Ps in the area. Cabs are also fairly easy to grab  Venue - bigger than the eyes can see, super high ceiling, cute tall chairs... Overall it's chiquement décoré. It was a little loud, perhaps becauase it was a busy night. The bathroom is where this resto lost most of its points (kinda stinky, doors dont lock properly). It calls for a makeover, BIG TIME!!  Staff - friendly, professional and courteous!! Made the dining experience more pleasurable.  Food - the cream of cauliflower was delightful, but the salmon I ordered wasnt as fresh as it should be so it smelled a little fishy. My friend's sirloin strips were tasty and nicely presented. Desserts were cute and light. Yumza!!  Drinks - had a sexy sangria and YES it was sexy, baby!!  Would return for private functions.... Just have to organize them so the bosses pick up the tab =P"}
{"text":"Went here for a group Get together.   It was upstairs as downstairs they were doing a happy hour special.  It was a zoo downstairs.   Upstairs was great.  Good food and a great bar.   The buffet had lots of variety from seafood to Indian to beef roast.  Deserts were all very good. The service was nicely done and the experience was great.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Was here for a corporate event, the venue was perfect, the rosewater room was elegant and great. We partook in the prix fix...the starters, main and dessert were all such a hopeless disappointment. The gnocchi was bland and rubbery. The watermelon in the watermelon salad was unripe and bright green - unsure as to whether that was the intent? The dessert was way too sweet - and did not reflect what was described on the menu one bit."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and 5 friends for Winterlicious... and it was delicious!  My wife is not a big eater, but she was this night.   I was extremely impressed with the size and and immediate experience when walking in the door... it's definitely grand.   The greeting staff were very nice, and walked us right to our table.  Some amazing architecture.   I enjoyed the following meal... all for the 35 dollar Winterlicious menu.    HORS D'OVRE House-Smoked Duck Prosciutto Pomegranate & Tangerine Salad, Sweet Potato Wafers  ENTRE Red Wine Braised Lamb Shank Garlic Mash, Roasted Root Cellar Vegetables, Rosemary Aioli  DESERT Trio of House-Spun Sorbets Fresh berries   The duck was FANTASTIC and my favourite item from the night.  It was the perfect combination of salty, with the sweet tangerine salad.  mmmm..  Lamb was excellent!!!  a really good size... some comfort food with the mash and veggies.     Sorbet was okay... but I'm not really a desert guy.   but I swear one of the sorbet flavours was grapefruit, which was really interesting because it was sweet and bitter at the same time.  thinking back, it was pretty cool.    In the end, fantastic experience... I would definitely come again.   I cannot comment on the non-winterlicious menu or experience, but I'm definitely a fan of this place.  We had a great time."}
