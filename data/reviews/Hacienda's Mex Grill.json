{"text":"We were so excited that a Mexican restaurant was opening in this space. Tried it out last night and we will be back.  Tableside guacamole was great. Very large portion so expect to fill up if you are a smaller group.  We both had enchiladas that were delicious. Rice and beans are not vegetarian so they substituted a side salad. Happy to accommodate and make recommendations.  Almost forgot to mention the margaritas! I tried the skinny and loved it. Tasted really fresh, no pre-made mixers here.  Service was great. So happy to have a new place close to home."}
{"text":"Brian B. Went at lunch to try it out good chips and salsa, had guacamole made table side, very good. Had chili Rejanos open with ground beef inside with Manchego cheese melted over with green chili sauce very good. Itzee was my waitress very good. Fast service. Hopefully they will stay in there the shopping center needed them. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. I am always very excited when we get a new restaurant in our area and I love to give the local places my business. We waited for an hour and 45 minutes for our food... The waitress was kind and kept coming out and apologizing, however the kitchen could not seem to get it together. It was only after we brought it to the manager's attention that we were eventually able to get our food. He was unapologetic. The food was hot but bland in flavor. If you want great Mexican food go to Salt & Lime down the street or for amazing southwestern go to Blue Adobe. I am doubtful this new place will make it:/"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican restaurant . What a find. Been coming to Scottsdale to visit family for 15 years. This is the best Mexican restaurant that we have found. High quality , fresh, chef prepared Mexican dishes beautifully presented. You can tell these guys really care about the food. Family owned and run, the hospitality is wonderful. Great Service. Beautiful interior design decor. Casual and comfortable but feeling of high quality and authentic Mexican. We are so glad we found this place. We will be back on every trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is not your typical Mexican restaurant, the food is amazing and the service is great.  We've tried multiple dishes  and all of them were excellent."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to hacienda Saturday night  and we were very pleased with the total experience. We feel so very fortunate to have a favorite Mexican restaurant and A French favorite  Voila so close by."}
{"text":"Tried to have a birthday dinner with no luck.  Chose to sit outside didn't not realize it was a no service area even though they indicated someone would be right with us.  Tick, tick, tick.... Went inside and asked if someone could wait on us seem to cause confusion but yes someone will be out.   Tick, tick... Someone comes out and waits a table after we arrived.  The nice family indicated we were there first and his response was \"not my table\".  Do I really need to say more.  Luckily Goldie's was right next door - voila service right away with a smile."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood restaurant. Been there several times since they have opened. Good happy hour specials and nice meals. Good patio views and friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"I am pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food and especially margaritas. I was a bit hesitant when i went to Hacienda's but clearly a family owned restaurant with great staff. The food was all very good, felt like home made and large portions!! But the craft margaritas by Jose behind the bar are excellent. These are not bottled, premade, but home made mixes.   Very impressed and pleased with a quality restaurant in Scottsdale Ranch."}
{"text":"Nicest people and very eager to please. We went their first day after their grand opening and they have a few bugs to work out: we got the wrong order, but they got right on it and got the right thing to us pretty quick. The spinach/mushroom enchilada was very good! Not so good was the grilled avocado salad - not much shrimp, too many greens and the 1/2 avos just didn't work for me. Nice atmosphere, easy to talk, not loud."}
{"text":"Went to this place by mistakenly placing order here rather than my usual since both names are kind of similar. Unappealing non creative food was handed to me maybe because they were closing and probably handed me the stuff they were going to throw away. To add insult to injury I think they overcharged me which I only noticed later. Last visit to this Pseudomexican culinary wasteland."}
{"text":"Long Wait Ended  For several years my wife and I have awaited an excellent neighborhood Mexican restaurant. Two came and quickly folded. The Haciendas Mexican Grill is the right interior decor, right menu, and right prices. Plus Happy Hour margaritas ($4), the patio, and live music on Saturday nights add to the ambience. Family-owned and operated with the right staff personalities. Anxious to take friends."}
{"text":"Not just another Mexican grill. Truly unique menu with a nice blend of texmex, Yucatán, and Sonoran. The Yucatán pork is tender and flavorful. The airline mole chicken was the best I have ever had. The wait staff is attentive, personable, and seem to truly enjoy their job. Thank goodness for a true departure from your typical mexi grill."}
{"text":"Great service great family restaurant awesome margaritas and guacamole at your table highly recommend"}
{"text":"finally got a great new restaurant at the Mercado.  Loved the food & service last night. Everybody in Scottsdale Ranch should give this place a try. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  This place has fabulous food!!!  It's a neighborhood HIDDEN GEM.  The chips and salsa was excellent. We had the fish tacos and grilled avocado salad with shrimp. Both were DELICIOUS!  The prices were very reasonable and the service was excellent. I can't wait to bring my friends here."}
{"text":"What a nice find! Newly opened in the Mercado in Scottsdale Ranch! Great mexican food! I got the lunch combo for $8.99 which was a wonderful spinach enchilada and chili releno! Thanks Izee and Juan!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Green Chile enchiladas were great! Also enjoyed the shrimp fajitas. Skinny margarita was delightful too!"}
{"text":"I really like the decor here and I had the carne asada nachos which were huge and delicious! The meat was really good and I loved the refried black beans... They were nice enough to make them with corn tortillas for me too instead of flour. There were a couple of other things on the menu I'd like to try, but honestly it's just too pricey for me and for Mexican food. I feel like they are going to suffer because of their prices.  There is way too much competition in town to have $15-$17 meals when you can get the same quality for close to half the price. Also, it says they open at 11 and they did not open until 11:30, so I did end up waiting for a half hour for them to open. Id like to go back but probably won't."}
{"text":"Delicious food with a twist. Margaritas are fabulous! Customer service is very welcoming.  Had food from the hr menu and the regular menu.  Has become my go to spot for Mexican in North Scottsdale......Love this place"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in during a bike ride and so glad we did! We sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome...friendly, professional and helpful. Their house margarita is SOOO good! Also very much enjoyed their Moscow Mule and Beef nachos...both excellent. Great place for a quick bite and a cocktail (or full meal!). Excited to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a cool new gem RIGHT next door to Goldie's!Great place and good sized plates . The avocado salad came with THREE alvocado halves . Almost too many crazy enough ! the shrimp was also awesome in the salad. Super surprising patio in the back and the bar area has a great vibe with plenty of tvs . I wasn't expecting it to look so cool when I stopped in . New in the area and I'm definitely coming back for the green chips and salsa, the AMAZING fried ice cream and great outside area , and the bar. They have  just enough tvs in the main dining area or maybe just one .. not enough  to not get distracted from a family dinner , but you won't  miss the games on either ! Still  seems like they are working out the minor things with service , but that is to be expected in the first month of opening and new staff . We had a great server who did a pretty good job with our table and  was very sweet and  prompt with our million requests . But really .. you should try the fried ice cream ! Huge and just bomb all around 10 score."}
{"text":"We loved the food! It has a fun atmosphere and creative food. I will say that we had a younger waitress who seemed pretty clueless, but I can't imagine all the servers are this way. Overall we had a great experience! The owner even passed by our table to ask how everything was, he was so pleasant to talk with."}
{"text":"Visiting from Honolulu, searching for authentic Mexican food as Walaha- mui delicioso!  Run in and get your tasty buds satisfied."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant as I heard it was under new owners. I must say this restaurant will not last long. I ordered the spinach mushroom enchilada, the mushrooms were crunchy, with wilted spinach, my husband ordered the crispy tacos, with shredded beef., very small more like an appetizer. . The rice I received was just white rice with a few jalapeños, ok. The black beans are ok. I will not go back, so sorry, I wish this place would succeed! I hate to write negative reviews!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with 5 other ladies yesterday and we were very pleasantly surprised.  The decor was inviting, the food delicious and hot.  We will all definitely go back and would highly recommend it.  The only thing was they had several groups of people come in about 10 minutes after we got there and the wait staff seemed a little overwhelmed.  I would chalk that up to the fact they have only been open a few weeks and are not quite sure of the flow of people.  A definite winner!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican lunches I've had. Their fajitas are huge. Good service as well. The spinach chips is to die for."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for Happy Hour, it was our first visit and we were very pleasantly surprised. We loved the food and atmosphere and will definitely return."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch at Hacienda and will be back for more. The servers and manager were very attentive and pleasant and the ambiance just right. The chicken tortilla soup was hearty and had lots of chicken, the enchiladas also very flavorful and well prepared and plated. We ate inside, but there is also outdoor seating for those who prefer that."}
{"text":"This is my second review this week for this newly opened or perhaps newly managed restaurant in the Mercado of Scottsdale Ranch.  We went to the grand opening and it was extremely busy and the wait staff was very efficient and we were waited on promptly.  It was happy hour, which was a surprise, and the house made margaritas and red sangria \"the best\" were only $4 for a huge glass.  We started with the spinach queso fundido and enjoyed the 3 tacos and the green chile enchiladas.  Both of the entrees were delicious and the queso was so creamy and flavorful.  I personally am not a fan of red and green chips; however, the fried flour tortilla chips were an interesting addition. So perhaps one should rethink the chip selection, and add more of the Mexican style chips to the mix.  Anyway, this should not take away from our great evening, great meal, and fun time.  We look forward to returning as we are fortunate to live close by."}
{"text":"Love the place and the food! Servers are amazing. The outside sitting is perfect during dinner time. I love the chips and salsa! Make sure to order their Barbacoa"}
{"text":"Good Mexican spot with traditional foods.  Excellent happy hour, the margaritas were not watered down and smaller as with are most places for happy hour.  Refried black (not brown) beans are good alternative.  The mushroom green chile cream sauce is good on enchiladas and burritos.  Try the burritos, huge and filling.  NOT filled with mostly rice or beans as most places.  Carnita dishes are tasty.  Bar area and outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great ambiance, owner did a good job decorating. Good food, great service, chimichangas were amazing"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale/Phoenix. The atmosphere is very nice, colorful, outdoor patio pretty. The  salsa is fresh, homemade by far the best I've had! The shrimp enchiladas recommended by the bartender are AMAZING!  Love this place. Great drinks (beautiful glasses) and food. I live nearby and frequent as much as I can. Waitstaff  also excellent."}
{"text":"Had Happy Hour there last night.  We can't say enough good about the entire experience, food excellent, staff very cordial, owner really on top of things.  It is 5 stars better than whoever the owner was previously.  Would recommend a visit to all who enjoy Mexican Food."}
{"text":"The chef must have been trained at Golden Corral. Bland, tasteless food that might appeal to diners who really don't care for Mexican cuisine. The \"green chili chicken enchilada\" contained no hint of green chili. The waitress explained the sauce as being made with cream of mushroom soup, and it certainly seemed like it was. Rice was also flavorless. Won't be back."}
{"text":"From my first step inside until my last on the way out, my entire experience was outstanding. The food, the service, everything."}
{"text":"So we eat out. A lot.  And we have high expectations - expectations commensurate with the type of place (great service can come on many forms).   When we walked in to this place, we were a little concerned by the lack of people there. DON'T BE!  It's a new (2nd) spot for a restaurant that is established.   The food was simply brilliant from start to finish. Great chips, great salsa to start.  Service was incredibly personable (Albert rocks!) and it's feels like an out of the way place.   Entrees... Get the Irene's enchiladas!  Might be one of the best and most flavorful enchilada dishes I've had. Ingredients are so fresh - wife commented that the beans and rice were even good. Our table also ordered red cheese enchiladas (wife loved em), the bean and cheese burrito (massive! Son loved it) and the pork flautas (son wolfed em down).   We are on vacation so we loaded up on desserts too. GET THE CHURROS. I know what you are thinking... churros?  These ain't your Taco Bell variety folks... Albert said they are known for them. The recognition is well deserved.   We loved it. Typically never do a repeat on a trip but may make an exception.  Thanks folks!"}
{"text":"Our 20min wait lasted 50min for seating. Our waitress finally addressed us after another 15min. drinks came 30min after we sat. Kids Food came 50min after we sat. adult food came 65min after we sat. Live in the neighborhood and would like to see this place survive, but I am not holding my breath."}
{"text":"Came during their happy hour. It was fairly empty around 4pm before it started getting crowded. The happy hour original margaritas on the rocks are really a steal for $4. I looked up yelp reviews prior to see what to order and most on here recommended the Avocado Salad. It was way better than expected! They're generous giving 3 avocado halves lightly grilled and grilled shrimp with a type of Cajun seasoning which was amazing! I would ask for less plum tomatoes as the salad felt like it had to much of an abundance of it. However great happy hour margaritas and entrees!"}
{"text":"We went here for the second time tonight and loved it just as much as the first! It's very family friendly, the food is AMAZING, and the staff is great! Our waitress tonight was Marjorie and she was awesome! Fast refills on chips, salsa and drinks. And let me be clear, we had several baskets of chips! They are delicious! She was very tentative and checked on us several times. She was very personable, funny, and made us feel like we were her top priority. Please go and support this local business. You won't regret it! Oh! They also have a patio which is perfect for this time of the year!"}
{"text":"Great authentic cuisine. Very friendly staff. I recommend this place highly. Easy to get a table. Great spot for lunch or dinner. It's definitely a hidden treasure, kind of tucked away between a few businesses but it's worth the while when you find it. Oh and the patio is a fantastic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great patio, atmosphere and food! Family run, hidden gem! Chili Relleno, burritos, fajitas might be the best in the valley!!"}
{"text":"Found our new go to neighborhood restaurant!! Everything about this place was on point and amazing!! Service was exceptional and the had my heart at the table side guacamole. They bring you out homemade chips with an amazing salsa to start. I'm pretty picky when it comes to salsa so I never expect anything great. Well this was GREAT!! Now on to main courses. They didn't disappoint! Had the carnitas chilie relleno the presentation was beautiful and this dish itself was amazing. Can't wait to go back and try a few more dishes we were eyeing."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Visited for lunch with my colleagues while in town for a conference. No wait even at noon! They had the best chips and salsa I have ever had. Seemed homemade.   The fried tacos were to die for and the rice was simple and tasty. My coworkers enjoyed their meals just as much.  If I'm ever back in town, this place will be on my list! Thanks!"}
{"text":"New neighborhood grill that does not disappoint! Avocado shrimp salad with added chicken is the best!  Shrimp empanadas! Yummm! Service is always good and nice back patio. Organic Marg"}
{"text":"The chips are AMAZING!!!!! Great food, very friendly staff. If you don't mind swatting a fly away, eat on the patio. Very pretty!!!! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Found this little gem by coincidence and loved it!  Service was great & staff was very friendly & knowledgeable about describing the food.  The skinny margarita was awesome   The chips (2 different kinds) with the salsa were outstanding and super freshly made.  Food was very delicious. Forgot to take a photo unfortunately.  Loved also that the noise level was not too loud like in most other restaurants. Finally a restaurant where you can have a great conversation with people without yelling your lungs out over the table.   I definitely will go back to this place."}
{"text":"We were up in Scottsdale today to do some running around and decided to give Hacienda's a try. The food was absolutely wonderful-highly recommend the mini chili relleno and the carnitas chili relleno. Service was terrific and the patio is beautiful!"}
{"text":"We were recommended other places but ended up here and thank goodness we did.  Everything was super delicious! The green chips were wonderfully light and crunchy, the tableside guacamole was yummy and a perfect combination , the queso  dip was superb, the  pork dish was fantastic, the green enchiladas were great the rice and beans were something special, my only critique would be the beef in the fajitas were a bit tough, other than that it was a near perfect dish. Jorge was a gracious host and it felt good to support a family business. Super fantastic, I Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The absolute best salsa i have ever had the pleasure of consuming. Beautiful decor, friendly staff, great food!"}
{"text":"Stopped to have a late lunch after reading reviews.  Hacienda's did not disappoint.  We had the grilled avocado salad and the shrimp on the salad were cooked perfectly.  The fish tacos and street tacos were both excellent.. we ordered flan to see if was as good as the rest of the meal and it was delicious.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Overpriced and false advertising. Went here first time and it was average but overpriced.  Decided to try again for happy hour. Website clearly says: Happy Hour every day. I will attach a pic. Also prices listed. We arrive 5:20 on a Sunday  and tell them we are there for HH and to sit on patio.  Dogs on patio at another table which is just annoying but we wait for a table and sit. The server comes and we say where is HH menu? \"Oh. No HH on Sundays. M- Sat only\" I said website says it is and he checks and another girls says oh sorry it only thru Friday. Um? He said Saturday? Which is it? I pointed out what website said and they said well we will honor it this once. Then they proceed to quote HH prices $2-3 more than website.  The whole point of trying HH was because the food was overpriced last time! At this point I'm just annoyed, I have 3 hungry kids and our plans for an early dinner are messed up.  We said forget it and left.  Mediocre food? Overpriced regular menu? False advertising? Pass.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent new restaurant in Scottsdale Ranch.  The food was delicious and service was great!  Love the patio and happy hour deals!"}
{"text":"I got sick from eating here. I ordered the carnitas burrito. The meat tasted old. I contacted them via their website but they did not respond. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"To start off, we missed the location at first and I had to call to ask where they are at. It's tucked in-between two other places. I added a photo to show outside of restaurant. It is a quaint place. Music was perfect volume. Staff was fantastic. My daughter had steak fajitas and all the staff came out smiling when they lit it on fire before serving it.  All food dishes were absolutely amazing. Red enchiladas, Irene's green chili enchiladas and the chicken flautas we wonderful. The black beans were great and I normally don't like black beans! The rice was fluffy goodness. The salsa had a bit of spice which was perfect and the chips were different. They were thicker and some were green. The guacamole was perfect!!! The ONLY thing that we did not love was the house margaritas. They were not good at all. They had no flavor at all. Tasted super watered down. Other than the margaritas, the place was seriously amazing."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar.  Great service.  Friendly bartender (but not too chatty) and the Sangria was EXCELLENT.    I had the chimichanga.   Tasty.    Neither the chimichanga or the salsa was very spicy but they had some good hot sauce to spice it up since I like my food really hot.     Good addition to the neighborhood.   Good food,  good service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. The lunch specials were great! I had the relleno and beef taco along with the rice and beans. Everything was well presented and perfectly done. My dad had the carne asada street taco and it was delicious! I've been here for dinner as well and everything was very good! Give this place a shot when you are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Dined there last night with friends. Excellent margaritas and very tasty food. Had the mini chicken tacos - plenty of food for a light meal. Topped it off with delicious soppopillas with honey and ice cream. Delish!  Server was excellent. Personable and efficient. We will return!!"}
{"text":"First time costumer. Found on yelp and decided to check it out!! Was seated immediately, granted we came right before closing, they were extremely welcoming even though we arrived shortly before closing. The food was great! Lots of options and great presentation! Waitress was very informative and knowledgeable and offered tons of options!"}
{"text":"We tried this newly opened Mexican place today and loved it!  Cool decor, beautiful patio and really enjoyed skinny margaritas, table side guac and shrimp quesadilla. Grand opening they said is 10/25 4-7pm and there will be tequila, wine, beer tastings and mariachis!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early lunch on a Monday. It was our first visit and we were happy to discover the menu had some unique selections including conchinita pibil. We opted for vegetarian dishes: veggie fajitas and a wet veggie burrito plus Lagunitas beer from the tap. The serving sizes are large, ingredients were well-seasoned and there was a large variety of items that came as sides. Add fast, friendly service--this restaurant is a cut above the usual Amercanized Mexican joint."}
{"text":"We have eaten here three times now and I would say the food is very good.  There have been times when items on the menu, both drink and food, aren't available but overall we have enjoyed eating here.   We have had the carnitas, street tacos and cheese enchiladas.   All of them were served hot and tasted great.   The service is usually very good.  We would recommend eating here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"A group of 11 if us went for dinner last night. Manny was the server. I ordered a reposodo Cadillac margarita. He served me a silver tequila margarita. I told him this isn't reposodo tequila. He said it was. Also it had no grand marnier. He said it did (liar). He said oh you want it Cadillac style I said yes. He brought back the same thing. Obviously someone, bar tender or he doesn't want to serve it correctly. He insisted it was 1800 rapasodo. Mind you the drink was a clear drink no color. Rapasodo is darker. And so is Grand Marnier. Anyway I didn't want to argue as I was part of a group. Then My friend ordered black beans and rice. Her black beans came Re-fried. I ordered Ole Mole with chicken in the enchiladas. He served me chicken breast with Mole smeared on it. WTF? Then my other friend ordered a chicken burro and he served him chicken breast with green chili sauce smeared on it. What a bad experience. Get rid of him as he made our dining experience very uncomfortable and made us unhappy. I do have to say though that the Mole sauce was good."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for happy hour on a Friday and was blown away! This is such a wonderful addition to our neighborhood! We had two happy hour margaritas which were perfect and just strong enough. We also had the happy hour nachos, mini chicken tacos, and coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp were our favorite but all of our choices were amazing. We sat on the patio which has a wood burning fireplace and pretty twinkle lights. I LOVE this patio. Arlene served us and was so pleasant and friendly we can't wait to come back to see her. Do yourself a favor and check Haciendas out"}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican I have had in AZ - delicious! You can tell everything is homemade. First time ever eating Mexican and not having a doggie bag to bring home, ate everything."}
{"text":"Went in Friday evening for Happy Hour and a little bite to eat.  (Our first visit here).  We sat at the bar at were immediately greeted by a Very Friendly Jose' who was making his margarita's from scratch - Yay!   My husband ordered the house and I went with the skinny!  I loved mine best!  Chips & Salsa were warm and very good, we especially liked the Spinach flour ones.  We ordered several appetizers, mini chicken tacos, beef empanadas and the mini chile relleno were our favorites.  We will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and best margarita in Scottsdale!!! If you have not been here you are missing out. Do not pass up the chance to try a new place. You will not be disappointed, I promise!"}
{"text":"wow, what a disaster .. ordered off of yelp/grub hub online. got a confirmation. it says order will be ready in 45-55 mins. about 30 mins later i get a phone call from a strange number and usually i never answer it, lucky i did, it was yelp/grub hub calling to tell me they have to cancel my order, they said they kept calling hacienda and no answer to confirm it on there end. So my wife calls and they answer. they had the order. what a mess. ordered a chimachinga that was ok, it was morel like a burrito then a chimachanga ."}
{"text":"Very good food. The menu has a mix of non-Mexican dishes too. The refried beans and rice that come with a lot of the meals are so much better than at other Mexican places. The margaritas are a little more expensive than other Mexican places but it was a hearty portion and tasted great. They have a big outdoor patio that can accommodate a large group, and they take reservations."}
{"text":"We eat at a lot of Mexican restaurants but this was by one of the best we have had in a long time. We were in town for a Medical conference so just visiting but will be back for the Mole. The live music was excellent and unexpected. Nice atmosphere and the sound level was good despite being busy. You will enjoy."}
{"text":"Great new place in Scottsdale.  Clvery friendly service... the owner is out and about. Fun, upbeat crowd but not too noisy. Great food. Flan to go! Outstanding! We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a really nice, unique Mexican restaurant with great food. Slightly unique, nice patio. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food at an extremely reasonable price. The building was beautiful and included an outdoor dining area with live music. Food was elevated, delicious and visually appealing.  If I wasn't vacationing and lived nearby, this would be a regular stop for me.  The service was outstanding."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dining in this fine establishment tonight.  I looked at my wife and said: \"Baby, let's try to the new Mexican restaurant next to Goldies!\"  Off we went.  We had been there before when it was called (insert another name to which I have forgotten) and wasn't a big fan of it.  Sadly it did not last and was only open for maybe six months.  When walking in, we noticed many couples having dinner and that was good. You never want to see a place empty when they first open.  They sat us right away.  We chose to sit in one of the booths and was greeted by Evelyn who would be our server.   The booth was a little dark, so we had to use the lights on our phones to read the menu.  I would suggest maybe turning the lights up just a smidge.  We had heard good things about this place and I had researched the north Scottsdale location to see what people had liked.  Seriously, all the food looked pretty good.   Their chips and salsa were among the best we've had.  I could simply not get enough.  My only gripe would be that the bowls they serve them in are just too small.  Good chips deserve a big bowl! hah...   I decided on the Pollo Fundido and she ordered the red enchiladas.  I've had Pollo Fundido at many places, but this place... this place did it perfectly.  It came out on a piping hot plate (let it cool down people!!) with a side of refried black beans and a small scoop of rice.  Both delicious!  The entree was just delicious and I wanted more!  It was so good that my wife even tried some of it.  ...trust me, that's rare!  She loved her enchiladas and we both looked at each other with the \"yes, we found a new place we love to eat!\"    Evelyn talked us into some fried ice cream for dessert.  Damn, was that good!  I highly recommend this place and we know we'll be regulars here. How can we not? It's only a few blocks from home.  If you head out there, please ask for Eveyln, she was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food even for getting it to go. I had the carne asada buritto. I loved their beans and guacamole. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Oh man... 100% honest review here, still sitting at the table. Grew up in Texas near the border eating Tex Mex. I was leaving work downtown and was craving authentic Mexican food. Couldn't find many decent options,  but came across Hacienda's Yelp page. To be honest, it was the photos of the interior that brought me in. It looked cozy.   The food and service, however, is what makes this my new favorite place. The margaritas are BIG. The food is BIG. But it's not just the quantity- it's the quality. These guys do it right. The mole is the good bitter stuff, homemade just as I was expecting. The pastor pork is to die for. The queso is basically spinach artichoke dip in the best way possible. Those green chips? No clue what they are but I'm hooked.  Keep it 100, Hacienda. I'll be back. You don't fit my macros, but I'll be back. Plenty of times."}
{"text":"So happy to have found this place! We went there today based on the reviews and were still very pleasantly surprised. Big portions of excellent food. The complimentary salsa is very tasty, the guac, excellent, the salad very fresh, the fish taco and veggie fajitas also very tasty.  The decor is really nice. Best of all, the family who run it are lovely! We'll be back!  Can't say I've been too impressed with the food since moving to the area. Definitely recommend this place though"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night and was blown away by the atmosphere, drinks, service, and delicious food! We had the freshly made table side guacamole, mini chicken tacos, and the Mexican burger. Everything was amazing! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"After all the Mexican restaurants were gone through in Arizona this is the first we leave a review @ bec of how pleased we were with the service and food!! We found our go to Mexican resterant ask for Alícia B to treat u with here energy"}
{"text":"Good food and ample servings.  Took a long time to get the food brought out.  New restaurant so they may be working out the bugs. Manager came by and apologized. Kitchen worker didn't show up for his shift.   Food was tremendous and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Newer location and appears to be struggling.  Greeted promptly and seated quickly with our reservations.  Tried a variety of items...table side guacamole, steak fajitas, burrito, and chicken enchiladas.  Guacamole was good, chicken burritos were good, steak fajita meat was tough and loaded with gristle, and the service was below average.  Waited for our server on multiple occasions as he went out to take smoke breaks and talk with coworkers.  Whenever the hostess wasn't doing anything she was on her cell phone and inattentive to guests unless approached.  Their North Scottsdale location is much better and had been in business for probably 10 years.  Simply, we prefer that location."}
{"text":"OMG, the food and service at this restaurant are fabulous. This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale, and I'm a Texas girl who has been eating Mexican food all of my life. The chips are just right, the salsa is delicious, and I love Irene's chicken enchiladas. The flan with a touch of orange is creamy and flavorful. We've eaten there five times since we discovered Hacienda's 2 weeks ago. Everybody we take there loves the pleasant family-owned restaurant. I've been dying for a great Mexican food place in Scottsdale for at least 6 years. This is it.  Anybody who doesn't love the food here is either insane or has no idea what great Mexican food is supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"This is has turned to my favorite Mexican restaurant I've been there 3 times and the food never disappoints and the service is great and very attentive I would definitely recommend this restaurant again and will be returning again"}
{"text":"Outstanding food in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The dishes are authentic and made with fresh ingredients. The service is prompt and friendly. And the atmosphere is casual. We sat out on the patio and had a great time!"}
{"text":"I could be generous and give Hacienda four stars because I applaud their attempt to go beyond the average neighborhood Mexican cuisine.  But I will be honest instead - 3 stars.  Just about every item we sampled was at least subtly different from what is normally served.  For example, the refried beans were made with black beans, the rice was very soft (my wife says overcooked) and had a fresh flavor, the street taco was very small (I didn't say all the differences were good), and the chimichanga was wrapped in a dough that was a cross between a tortilla and fry bread (far too dominating).  In general the flavors were good, the server friendly, and the restaurant was clean, although empty at 12:30 on a weekday.  The dessert list was interesting but the fried ice cream was yech, being wrapped in something that had a consistency uncannily like cardboard.  Hacienda is not inexpensive.  Portions vary greatly in size from one item to another but on average are adequate.  Perhaps the most telling point is that when I visit a restaurant for the first time, I usually leave thinking what other dishes I would like to try if I came back.  Not here - I think I know what they do and have no yearning to try again."}
{"text":"Carne asada & chicken tacos were good, chimichanga was ok, nothing special. The rice was also ok. Food was decent but not exceptional."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, prompt, and polite. The atmosphere was laid back but we felt intimate at our table. The food was fresh, had nice presentation and the taste was flavorful.  The location is easy to find off of E Via Linda and Mountain View in the Mercado shopping center.  Decorations for Christmas were tasteful and well done.  Price was very nice! Three entrees and still just over $50. We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Great new place, I had the cheese enchiladas... very yummy!  The drinks are cheap and they have a huge patio.   The service was helpful and nice.   I'm coming back."}
{"text":"As a Mexican I always had people asking me of where to find some authentic Mexican dishes, well here they are. La Hacienda's menu is for traditional American-Mexican goodies like burritos fajitas quesadillas and also cochinita pibill, chicken mole, chicken chorizo, street tacos, empanadas and more of Mexican-mexican goodies for foodies !! Great service, nice restaurant !! Good job Keep it up"}
{"text":"So happy this restaurant is now in our neighborhood. Excellent food and service. You won't be disappointed. Nice outdoor patio, too."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic service! And a wonderful seating area in the back. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is worthy of a solid three stars rating, but the lovely patio adds a fourth. We are not big on cilantro, which often dominates local Mexican cuisine. This place offers more balanced flavors, but I did think the seasonings lacked kick. The grilled avocados were a nice, new experience. The accompanying shrimp were a bit over but flavorful. The lamb was quite tasty if under-seasoned. The Pico de gallo was quite subtle. We asked for veggies instead of rice and beans. They were quite good. Special kudos to our server who showed great professionalism. Of course the real joy is eating outside in mid-winter."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great service. Will be our new go to for Mexican food in the area! Can't wait to try their happy hour."}
{"text":"This place was delish!!!  Went for the first time on a Friday night, got seated right away & was greeted immediately by their friendly staff.  The chips & salsa were yummy, the beers were cold, and all of our entrees were soooo good!  My husband really wanted shrimp tacos (which were not an entree on the menu - but they said he could order them anyway....that is great customer service!)  And, the shrimp tacos were overflowing with delicious shrimp.  My son & I both got the spinach / mushroom enchiladas and my the son got a grilled chicken burrito...all of it was amazing....even down to the rice & beans!!   Best of all, the prices were reasonable which is hard to find in Scottsdale.  This place is definitely our new favorite Mexican restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice since it opened and pleased both times! Tableside guac is amazing.  I always get a variety of different street tacos, which are my favorite.  Husband got the fajitas and loved them. This will be a regular dining place for us.  The service was amazing, too!"}
{"text":"This is one of the Best Mexican Restaurants i been to. The food is delicious and the patio is the place sit. Dont miss out on the delicious beef and chicken fajitas  also ask for their guac. Its and avocado dipping sauce prepared at your table. The waiters very friendly and took very good care of us. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"Expensive for Mexican food, but very good. The refried black beans are amaaaazing. Good chips with spicy salsa. Kids menu items are quite affordable at $4.99 each. I got the enchiladas & my waitress happily accommodated my request to try one each: red sauce (best!), mole (very good), & spinach with green sauce. I like the eclectic, modern Mexican decor. Friendly & attentive service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very clean, the prices are affordable for the area. I'm pleased with how the workers are very friendly and good I'm communication.  I always got more than expected if I put an order for pick up.  I enjoy the atmosphere, cleanliness, prompt service and food that is ready when I ordered it either by phone or am there in person! I will definitely be recommending this place to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Great find! Found this place on Yelp and am glad we did. Fresh ingredients, great food and service. Try the Chimichanga !"}
{"text":"I so cannot wait to come back and eat here again. A lot of handmade food, including the homemade tortilla chips in four colors, one made from spinach flour. Served warm and fresh.   I am picky about salsa and this is really good and made from roasted red tomatoes with just the right tang and amount of heat.    Mental note made about several delicious sounding appetizers on the menu such as coconut shrimp with red chili sauce and shrimp enchiladas.  I loved the cheese enchiladas and my husband went on and on about the good flavor of his grilled chicken burrito.  Our server was a delight and went out of her way to please our table."}
