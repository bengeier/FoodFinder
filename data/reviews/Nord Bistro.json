{"text":"Our third visit and what a treat!
Understated excellence and fresh, fresh ingredients sublimely prepared. Great neighbourhood service with an authentic smile. The bouillabaisse, calamari with maple glaze (try it!), mussels and duck confit and ... salted chocolate torte really standout!

A local gem!"}
{"text":"Wow.  We did not want to wait in line at another brunch spot, and came here instead. So glad we did. Latte bowls perfectly made.  Chef Bart came out and spoke with us when we asked for hot sauce to ask us how hot we wantes it as he hade a house made sauce. So inpressive! Had the montreal and the ham eggs benny. Preferred the ham but both were amazing. Potatoes were lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and perefectly cooked. Sliced tomatoes with olive oil and basil (similar to a pesto without pinenuts), paired nicely. On buttered crusty bread, homemade hollandaise sauce. You need to eat here!"}
{"text":"We had a Sunday birthday brunch here.  It's a lovely spot. Food was excellent and so was the service.  $5 mimosas hit the spot. Would definitely come back for brunch and would definitely like to try a dinner."}

{"text":"I stopped in for lunch recently with my parents.  It was a great experience.  I had a burger, but not just any burger.  It was made with chuck, brisket and short ribs -- out of this world.  It came with pommes frites which were awesome.  My folks each had a croque monsieur and they were very happy.

Normally, we've gone to Nord for dinner which we always enjoy.  This was my first time in for lunch and I'll be back.  The service was great, the white wine we ordered was lovely and overall, the experience was very, very good."}
{"text":"Vacationing in Toronto, from Boston. Stopped here for a bite to eat based off of reviews, and we were not disappointed. Daily menu specials are delightful. Ordered a brie and smoked applewood ham omelette. Atmosphere is very nice, and the owners are welcoming and kind. I would highly recommend this spot!"}
