{"text":"Very clean, friendly people working there, the food was hot, fresh, and very good!  It is a takeout place, but the sign says they deliver within a 2 mile radius.  Would definitely recommend & go back if you like Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Tasty N Healthy is a tasty, healthy, quick, clean, authentic, inexpensive, humble, and friendly option in an area otherwise dominated by pre-processed fast food chains. If you are hungry in Penn Hills and want to feel good after eating, try to find them. Located in a nondescript storefront in the Penn Hills Shopping Plaza, Tasty N Healthy is a tremendous discovery. Look for the picture of a gyro in the window. Who thought that authentic Mediterranean food could be obtained in this neck of the woods?

The menu is rather slender. When they first opened, you could buy the entire menu for about $40. They have since expanded to offer daily meals. I have not yet delved into the daily meals (pre-ordering is required), but everything else is so solid that I can only assume that they are tasty, though I promise to investigate. The tabbouli, fatoosh, and Greek salads are great. Thoughts of the falafel sandwich and chicken shawarma trigger Pavlovian response as I write. The weakest link in their menu is probably the gyro. It's good, but not nearly as good as everything else.

Warning: It's take-out only. There are no tables. It is a real Syrian mom's super-clean kitchen disguised as a tiny storefront. Take it, go, and enjoy. Tasty N Healthy also does catering."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here and I was pleasantly surprised.  Everyone loved what they got.  Hummus, pita's, pita chips, chicken shawarma tortilla wrap, spinach pie and falafel in tortilla, it was all great and fresh.  I will be ordering from there again.  The prices are really low for what the quality is as well."}
{"text":"So Blessed to have a halal Restaurant nearby! Beyond Tasty,and most definitely Healthy. I personally recommend the Lamb Burger,the Chicken Salad,the Gyro (of course),the Lamb Kebab with Jasmine rice (my personal Favorite)~ not just any Jasmine rice either. I guarantee that it's the Best you have ever tasted. For your sweet tooth,the Tiramisu or Strawberry Dessert cups,and the Baklava is like none other. The customer service is  Superior, and the Restaurant and kitchen are absolutley spotless clean. Please come and feed your body and soul with Tasty & Healthy halal food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! I love the shawarma, the tabbouli, the eggplant dips, and the steak sandwich.  The kitchen is spotless and the food is fresh.  My kids love the food from here and so do I."}
{"text":"Came in on a whim because they have taboullah and I will certainly be back! Friendly service and very clean. You can see them preparing your food. The taboullah is excellent the best I have had in some time. 
This is take out only and there is limited drink variety but since you are taking out anyways a huge variety isn't necessary."}
{"text":"This little takeout restaurant is such a surprise. It's a tiny, unassuming storefront in a strip mall, but the food is excellent and dirt cheap. The falafel is the best I've had in Pittsburgh. The dips and desserts are fantastic as well. Great spot for authentic Mediterranean."}
{"text":"The falafel burger was wonderful. Appreciate the variety of vegetarian choices. While visited Pitt we came across this mom and pop take out with authentic Med./Me. Service was quick and staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Nice and affordable Mediterranean food hidden in a strip mall.  This mom and pop shop offers service with a smile and were very pleasent.  We had the lamb over rice and chicken schwarma, which tasted great. The rice was lightly seasoned and complimented the protein well. Love supporting local establishments and will return."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot hidden away in a Penn Hills shopping center. The food is authentic and delicious. The staff are extremely polite and courteous. I've been through a number of times and plan to continue that trend. \"Tasty and healthy\" lives up to their name."}
{"text":"Just want to give shout out to this really, really great restaurant in Penn Hills Plaza. We were coming home from a long day out and were too tired to cook, ( sound familiar?) even though it was just before their closing time, this dear couple happily took our order and we were blessed with the MOST delicious food: hummus and two kinds of roasted eggplant salad, tabooleh and gyros....amazing, and fresh and whole ingredients...and the price is nothing short of amazing. OH and we found out they deliver within a 2-3 mile radius, for orders over 20.00. HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Quick, healthy and delicious. Excellent tabouleh, chicken shawarma with rice and gyro. Fries are great, crispy but not greasy - I would like a little more salt on them, but maybe they're healthier with out it, ha. The service is great - they were kind and patient when we took our time ordering. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anybody who wants to eat healthy yummy food without making a hole in their pocket."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Everything I've order from here has been fresh, tasty, healthy, and most importantly YUMMY!!!! Surprisingly I have yet to be disappointed!  Here's what I've tried so far:
- Greek Salad!!!
- Gyro Salad !!!
- Chicken Shawarma with Garlic Dip!!
- Lamb Burger!!!!
- Spinach Pie!!
- Lamb Kabob w/ Rice !!
- Grilled Chicken w/ Rice !!
- Baklava !!!

I'm sure you can tell what May favorites are!  I recommend this place to anyone!!  Don't take my \"review\" for it... try it for yourself!!! The owners are very friendly!!!!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were thrilled to discover this restaurant, which also delivers to our area. Flavors and ingredients are authentic. We ordered chicken shawarma, lamb gyro, spinach pie, mouttabal, and stuffed grape leaves. Chicken shawarma came with their garlic sauce, which was delicious and something we've never had before. The price was reasonable; having food this delicious delivered is beyond wonderful."}
{"text":"Perfect name because the food is both tasty and healthy. I love Mediterranean food and the falafel and shawarma here are so good. A must try!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome love falafel sandwich and shawarma sandwich I prefer they have 2 table at least to dine in. I hope they will expand later on."}
{"text":"Get the chicken Schwarma. It was so good. Lamb over rice was also good. 
 
Location: run down plaza that is somewhat hidden. 

Price: the price for both was a little over $15.00

Interior: Small and may need a little maintenance. Has a bench for waiting but no tables to eat. 

Service: friendly but takes a little long to receive food. Probably because everything is made fresh to order?!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite takeout restaurant. It is very clean. It is a family of restaurant. Prices are very reasonable. Very authentic homemade food. In short, it is healthy clean, cheap, homemade and tasty, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Lowering my review because they have switched to commercial garlic sauce... not good."}
{"text":"Fresh and authentic takeout! An oasis amid the fast food restaurants of Penn Hills Center. Haven't had a bad meal yet. Two snaps and a twist!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh! They have take out and delivery; they even delivered to our house today despite the snow! We order from this place almost every week. There are always the same friendly people there and amazing customer service. Everything on the menu is delicious but the Falafel Burger and the the Chocolate Biscuit Roll are as unique as they are delicious. They have convenient ordering online and are very involved in the community, participating in local events and charities. Try their dips (baba ganoshe, hummus, and mouttabal) and pita bread for a tasty snack! Their Cajun fries are so good, especially with the garlic dipping sauce! They even have frozen foods and a catering menu (Falafel Bucket Anyone??). Where else can you get something like that? It's a go to with all of our family and friends! I can't recommend them enough!!! :)"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place early on and I am hooked! I absolutely love this place.  The food is fresh.  You can tell it s made it with a lot love.  I have to recommend their chicken shawarma wrapped in tortilla.  Wow Wow... The flavour is solid and so rich...   I'll have to try everything on their menu.  Of your in Penn Hills, order from this place...  Taste for yourself!"}
{"text":"I visited this place when helping my sister move in the beginning of the year. It was new and we didn't know what to expect, but wandered in anyhow. The place is run by a Syrian family and everyone else is right--the kitchen (which you can see from the front counter) is absolutely spotless. 

You can tell the food is made with love and is made from scratch. Nothing we had (Greek Salad, spinach pie, gyro, hummus and pita chips) tasted generic. A Mediterranean place is nice in the sea of various pizza places around Penn Hills. I didn't feel overly greasy or gross from eating here, and the prices are incredibly cheap! I'd say the only downfall of this place is that they don't really stay open for dinner hours, so it makes it hard to get to unless you're in PH during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Love their food! It's healthy and delicious. It really tastes authentic too! I am a huge fan of falafel and this is definitely one of the places that you can get good falafel at. I'd also highly recommend their salads too."}
{"text":"The grape leaves are great!! They serve them cold but I actually like them both hot and cold. The gyro doesn't come with lamb but beef only which is kind of a bust but I choose the chicken sandwich and the pickles really make the flavors come out. They use some kind of sauce that is like mayo but it taste amazing!!

I also ordered the fried ricotta cheese puffs and they were pleasant as well. This place has no room for tables maybe one if they really wanted it but otherwise there is just a bench to sit at while you wait for your order.

They kitchen is super clean and very well organized so kudos to tasty for the best looking restaurant kitchen I've ever seen. Granted the place is only 4 months old so the compliment may come to soon. 

I think this place will be a good goto spot for cheap eats. Nothing cost more than $7 so that's a bonus for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and fresh as their name implies. It's a true mom and pop establishment and everything tastes so good and homemade! The place is clean and open. When you go in you can see the entire kitchen and your food being made. The prices are beyond reasonable considering the quality. We love the chicken shawarma and their falafel wraps on pita. I tried their baba ghanoush for the first time today and it's perfect. It's delicious, authentic and has more flavor then ones I've tried in the past. We'll continue to come here for good homemade middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"I really like the chicken shawarma in pita bread here.  I usually pair that with the mini chicken rolls with garlic dipping sauce.  There are always the same two people working when I go in and I'm pretty sure the guy at the desk knows what I'm about to order when he sees me lol.  I've also had the grilled chicken salad which is good and unique made with kidney beans, sour cream and some other healthy foods.  My food has always seemed fresh cooked, made to order.  Their menu has lots of vegetarian and gluten-free options as well.  They have no tables inside and offer take out only.  Maybe call ahead to order if you don't want to wait for your food to be prepared.  Catering is available.  A great option for tasty and inexpensive Mediterranean food in the Penn Hills shopping center."}
{"text":"Ordering and paying online is so convenient! The food is so good! The establishment is very clean and the proprietors are very nice! Definitely recommend and will be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"What a great little gem hidden in penn hills! Really affordable and good portions, the place is spotless, and the people working are friendly. So far I've had the dips and they are all fantastic! Best hummus I've had in quite awhile"}
{"text":"This is a new discovery for us and we'll definitely be back.  We ordered chicken shwarma with rice, spinach pie, and hummus. All of it was well seasoned and delicious with great portions for the price. The hot sauce was almost like a salsa and not as hot as expected, but a great meal anyway."}
