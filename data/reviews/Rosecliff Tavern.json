{"text":"Best bar in Monroeville. The owner's a nice guy and the bartenders/waitresses are friendly. The prices and food are also good."}
{"text":"I was here on 3/25/15 and I got to say this place is pretty awesome ! The service was perfect the bartenders were so nice and easy on the eyes if you get my drift (one of them did stare at me a lot tho) but that's another story the food is great I could eat it 5 times a week! But the yuengling beer this is amazing I could drink it all night pitcher by pitcher till there is none left"}
{"text":"I was in here on 3/25/15 and I have to say, hands down the best service I've ever received. the one bartender I think needs lasik eye surgery but that's none of my business. other than that, the food was way better than what you would think it would be, the service is excellent and the bartenders aren't to bad to look at either. idk what it is about their yuengling, but man I could just drink it by the pitcher. 

anyway, check this place out you won't be dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"Knew we were in a good place when it was filled by locals.  It looks like a bar from the outside, because it is a bar.  Service was great, and the food was better."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we try this place, it was not crowded and the food was decent. I ordered an open-faced steak sandwich and it was literally a thick juicy rib eye  steak on a chunk of garlic bread. My fiancé ordered the sirloin steak it was not as good or as big and cost more money. I lucked out in my choice I guess. My friends both got hamburgers they seemed to really enjoy them.  I'm giving 3 stars based on atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place! The food is great and the service is always spot on. The girls are always moving and checking in on customers. Aileen and nicolina are the best!"}
{"text":"If you want to go somewhere where they treat you like family and the bartenders are adorable and so sweet and the food is amazing, come to Rosecliff.  Every patron is treated with respect.  The prices are reasonable and and the beer is cold.  

The owner runs a tight ship so there isn't any shady stuff going on like there is at other bars.  Bartenders don't steal or give away free drinks illegally and there aren't drugs in the bathroom.  

The head chef is always trying knew 
things to please the clientele.  The kitchen is clean and he doesn't serve old, expired food.  Everything is fresh.

Yes, it's a smoking bar,  but the owner makes sure that there is always ample ventilation.   

I have nothing bad to say.  I think it is a very well run establishment with great employees and great food."}
{"text":"Disgusting smokey dive bar. Overpriced weak drinks and terrible service. AVOID!! Go to one of the many other terrible bars Monroeville. It's amazing this place is still in business."}
{"text":"This is a great place with great employees, fantastic food and as one said: this IS a five star dive bar. If you're in the area, do yourself a fav and stop here and say hi. You won't regret it...

UPDATE: Went back again on 8/1/17 and the pizza, wings and service was fantastic! Keep up the good job Rosecliff. Be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Thought it was a fun place, until i was unknowing fully overcharged for drinks and the bartenders acted like I was being a problem for callin em out in front of everybody.  Taking advantage of someone else's money is Disrespectful and wrong!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place except they allow smoking. Smoking and food DO NOT MIX! I was enjoying my time and about to order from the menu (Which looked delicious) and then the guy right next to me lit one up, smoke wafting towards my face the whole time. I finished my drink and left for food somewhere else. Maybe it's that the place is small, and makes it less bearable."}
{"text":"First time visit here Last Firday 11/6/15. 3 locals and three out of town guests.Started of well. Good food. Good Service. Really, the food was a lot better than I would have expected from a place that allowed smoking in such a small space.

 However, near the end of the meal, one of the \"bar lushes\" decided that since some of our group was from out of town, and since she was totally blackout drunk and likely suffering from an untreated mental disorder, she needed to lean over our table and tell us inane stories while waving her filthy hands about near our hands and faces and over out food.  One lady from out of town that was nearly getting smacked in the head by this freakshow finally escaped out the side door and got a waitress (who had been seemingly avoiding the whole thing), who had to physically pull the drunk away from our table. So, did they shut her off? send her home? Sit her down the opposite end of the bar away from us? NOPE Of course not! They poured more beer down her pie hole and sat her down at the video poker machine not 6 feet away from our table.  Where she proceeded to yell insults at us because we had asked staff to stop her bothering us. I had to complain 3 times to the manager to get this taken care of.  They actually got her to stop cursing us out after a while, but they let hang around our table and kept overserving her.

 So while the food is good and there is no problem with the table service.  They seem to have no problems over-serving lunatics till they are raging drunk and letting them run arund there establishment.  Kind of ruined the evening for me. Also, this patron was well known to everyone in the bar was 9 sheets to the wind at 7 pm Friday night. 

 Apology from management was weak, and nothing was comped. I can't speak for anyone else in my party, but I can't imagine why I would go back. Basically, I don't not feel my patronage was appreciated by the establishment.

 (TL;DR - Good food, 3 stars removed for having to deal with annoying drunk accosting our table and having trouble getting mgmt to take care of the situation)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Rosecliff just wish it wasn't so smokey. The food is always excellent & hot when brought to table. Love the changing specials too! Love love love!!"}
{"text":"I thought the whole county bans smoking in public places, but apparently this outfit feels that it is above the law. The place reeks of cigarette smell and people skoke actively in there. The stench from the cigarettes destroys any appetite one may have in food or alcohol. Don't they get it?"}
{"text":"Came in around 10 on Sunday - its packed and the kitchen is still open. Great sign. Immediately sit, phenomenal service the entire time (even though it's crazy busy and maybe two servers working the bar? Charlotte is a workhorse!) and we order a small order of fries and six naked wings. These are SPECTACULAR wings, whole, perfect amount of crispy and a great value. Really, the portions are very favorable to the patron for the price! The only thing I would change is smoking is allowed and that can be a drag, but really, for a smoking bar it was still very very fresh. I'd come back for sure if I was a townie."}
{"text":"Stopped by on 03/11/15. Nice place with decent food. I have to give star (one for nice place/decent food). However it stops there- for the disgusting service. I don't care to ever be waited on someone actively smoking. The PREGNANT bartender was smoking while serving drinks and food. This is repulsive and any establishment that supports this behavior should be shut down. . I work in healthcare and am often confronted with \"interesting\" behavior but this is uncalled for. Whatever she does to her unborn child IS technically her business but a business shouldn't allow this during a shift. On top of her habit that can't wait until break or after work- She consistently was on her phone (with said cigarettes), ignoring her tasks as a server, my glass waiting, waiting, waiting to be refilled... I would enjoy my job to if I didn't have to actually work & is like chilling at home on a Friday night. Until this experience- I am appalled that management would allow this behavior. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Saw the other reviews and thought we would swing by... 

So I never ever thought these words would come out of my mouth, being a former smoker....  but when we opened the door and that smoke hit us in the face I almost turned right around..  Please for the love of all thats holy get a good smoke eater! It really doesn't have to be that bad!

So anywho.... the server was friendly, and prompt it's not really a cocktail type of place so beer and Jack and cokes please..  even still the drinks were done well not to strong and not watered down like some places.

He had the monk burger and I had half Italian hoagie both came with fries. They were both really good... we would love to go back just to eat but maybe on a night not so busy... 
 
The smoke was just so bad... the food is a 5 star all the way but I just can't, things also didn't seem very clean but they where busy... 

We will try it agian  sometime hopefully the smog is cleaned up a bit. Seriously came home and immediately through our clothes the washer! 
Even just a fan sucking it out a window would be better... there were fans in the ceiling on full blast and there was at least the appearance of a smoke eater but it definitely wasn't working. Please fix it... we would love to be regulars."}
{"text":"If you're looking for that divey, smokey experience, then this is your place!

The food was pretty good and the service wasn't bad, but the inside is so small and cramped.. it really seems to me that this was just meant to be a small local hang out and it turned into something more than they planned- which is not a bad thing, by any means! However, there's that part about it being small and cramped that kind of goes a long with that. And again, they do allow smoking so be aware of that if you're sensitive to smoke. Because it is so small and there are so many people, it can get over whelming. Also, almost every employee working was seen smoking, including the kitchen staff. Now, they smoked in the dining room before they'd walk back to the kitchen.. but yikes. If the smell didn't bother me, that sort of did......

Truthfully, there's not much to say. I thought the food was good, so if that's your priority I'd say give it try. I can't say we'll go back, but not necessarily because of anything they did or didn't do.. it's just not a place that will stick out in our memories as being a go-to. 

Also, if you check in on yelp they offer you a small discount.. although they never gave me mine.. it's only like 10% or something so I didn't press it, but still!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Tastes great, plated well and cheap! Excellent portion sizes. Atmosphere is nice with lots of TVs and good music. Looks like a dive bar. Only downside is they allow smoking so if you're a non-smoker you may not like it."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood bar. Good food. Good people.

Be prepared that you're walking into an establishment that allows smoking, that's it.

Im a non smoker, but I enjoy the people and the food."}
{"text":"Great food for a dive bar. Unique specials throughout the week.  Homemade soups and great pizza. I recommend the burgers, wings  and French dip."}
{"text":"For a bar that looks somewhat off the beaten path at first glance, the food is amazing, making it a great spot for dinner as well as drinks. I've been hooked since my first visit, and now frequent Roescliff on a weekly basis! I may have my go-to menu items, but their specials are usually spot on as well, and keep the menu fresh and varied.

It's busy enough that there's always something going on, but never obnoxiously loud or overcrowded. The waitresses and staff are incredibly friendly and just all around awesome!"}
{"text":"I found myself in Monroeville today and after looking at this site for a lunch time recommendation, I walked into the Rose Cliff Tavern.  

It was a bit of a surprise for me that the first thing that I saw when I walked in the side entrance were four slot machines. The place was a bit smoky for my personal choice but decided to stay and give it a try anyway.  

I bellied up to the bar and eyed over the nine choices of beers on tap:  Lakefront Maibock, Yungling, Yards Brawler,  Hell Town,  Kentucky Bourbon Barrel,  Sam Adams Cold Snap,  Guinness and Coors Light. Something for just about everyone. 

The menu has a good variety of pub fare: appetizers, salads, hot and cold sandwiches, a few dinner entrees but pizza seems to be the main focus. There was also a dagwood sandwich and steak fajitas available as the special of the day. 

The bartender showed me a picture of the dagwood sandwich on her phone and it looked as if it had about a pound of lunch meat and cheeses on it. Way more food than I was hungry for... I opted for the french dip, home fries and the Lakefront Maibock.

The french dip sandwich came on a gently toasted bun and it was amazingly delicious.  The home fries had some sautéed peppers mixed in and they were done to perfection; crispy on the outside,  fluffy on the inside. The Maibock complimented the meal wonderfully. 

Unfortunately the smoking detracts from this place but it doesn't seem to be hurting thier business. There were fourteen people in this place at 2:00 on a Monday afternoon. If you don't mind the smoking, I would recommend the Rose Cliff tavern.  If smoking is an issue for you,  you could always call ahead for take-out. Judging from what I had and from what I saw on other people's plates, the food here is quality pub fare."}
{"text":"Horrible, food , horrible service, bartender waits on table , so if your at bar you will 100% get neglected,  it's ridiculous.  Stay away, it's mostly older men in there 70s that go there and they don't care about the horrible service.  They are there to get drunk because they are bored at home and have nothing better to do. When I was in there it was all men no women at all, just a bunch of local drunks, complaining about Donald Trump. Little do they know he is probably the best president we have had in years, this bar sucks.. my sandwich was so bad I couldn't even eat it, bottom bun was so soggy it fell Apart"}
{"text":"Good local spot when in Monroeville, good place to sit and drink a few. Usually busy later in the evening and weekends. Not a bad selection of craft beers. Mixed crowd where everyone gets along. Bartenders are attentive and keep up w the patrons. Smoking bar area."}
{"text":"This is just based on alcohol, didn't get to try the food. Would be 3.5 Went there on a Saturday night. The place was packed but service was still amazing. They let us change a tv to what we wanted to watch. Drinks were very reasonably priced. The only downside was it was super super smokey... but some people may not mind that. Other than that, it was a fun bar."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Monroeville. It's a great locals bar and the food is delicious every time. The wings are some of the best I've ever had!

Smoking is allowed inside, just to warn you!"}
{"text":"Great food, not a bad choice on the menu, been there numerous times and never dissapointed,  although I am a smoker I can see why some people wouldn't like the small quarters it can get very smoky , they do offer takeout for those not smoking..will definitely keep on my favorite list"}
{"text":"My new favorite go to, for great tasting pub fare!  Enjoyed the homemade Oscar hot sausage sandwich and the wife Tammy tried the fish sandwich. AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!! Hot sausage was advertised as super hot but I found it medium hot, and most flavorful.  Fish sandwich was large and perfectly cooked, bread toasted perfectly. Looking forward to coming back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Whole wings are friend perfectly, sauces are really unique in taste. Service is very welcoming. This place is packed with taste for a small tavern. Definitely a check out"}
