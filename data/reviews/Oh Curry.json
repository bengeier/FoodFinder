{"text":"This is great authentic Japanese curry! I have been going here for a while and it is delicious every time. I mainly eat the chicken cutlet or the curry udon. I went to Japan a few months ago and had curry several times while there, specifically Tokyo. Like around Shinjuku and Akihabara. I have eaten here before going to Japan and it was awesome but now that I have been to Japan I can say that it is authentic. It wasn't too far from how delicious the curry was in Japan. The owner is a cool guy too. I think I remember him saying he is from Akihabara.  Here in Vegas you probably won't find a Japanese curry as good as here, so take advantage!"}
{"text":"I havn't had curry this good since Coco's ichiban in Okinawa, Japan. Perfect blend of spices at a price you cant beat. Definatly my favorite place to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was craving curry and my boyfriend & I was searching for a good place to eat some. Sadly there's not a lot of place that sell good curry in Vegas but with some research we found this place and I convinced my boyfriend to go try it even if it's quite far away from our home. It was a really good decision ! The owner gave us a warm welcome and was really friendly and talkative with us. The curry is amazing ! The gravy is thick and give this warm feeling that curry should have. And I like how we can add the topping of our choice (I was really glad they have cheese as topping option, as a cheese lover, haha.)   So if you live in Vegas and want good curry, Oh! Curry is the place you need."}
{"text":"Very first Japanese food place at east side. Owner of this place is Japanese he is the one that preparing the curry.. Curry is very tasty and good. I came here few times already and never regret it because that are really taste like Japanese curry."}
{"text":"My all time favorite place to eat!!! The food is amazing and the cashier is extreamly nice and pleasant also very helpful!! The owner is kind and chats with the customers to see how there experience was. All in all a great place to check out!!!"}
{"text":"The owner is such a lovely fellow. Reminds me of Curry House in Hawaii but more affordable. Portion aren't as large but quality is still there. Delicious and great service. I even scored extra pickles for free because I love them so much with my curry."}
{"text":"Oh Curry is a quaint little place of selling just Japanese curry dishes. The menu might not be as vast as some other eatery. But they make it up with fast service,  good quality food n affordability!"}
{"text":"They are doing an excellent job overall. The service is fast and friendly. Their curry recipe is very good,  It has a darker, tangy, savory, gravy-like flavor- and it is less sweet than most Japanese curry that I have had. I've dined at many Japanese curry restaurants, and Oh Curry ranks among the best. Definitely a must-try if you are looking for something different, or just a simple, affordable, good-tasting meal.  Other thoughts: their menu is simple and straightforward by design. I suggested to the host that they might want to consider adding tofu as an option for vegetarian diners, and I got the sense they might possibly be open to it if there seemed to be demand for it from their customers."}
{"text":"Great curry and great service! Their curry was delicious; served with a variety of toppings (I had veggies and chicken katsu. YUM!) and offered as mild, medium, or hot! The cashier/waitress was really helpful and polite. The restaurant was very clean and our kids ate free because we dined in."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful little hidden gem! The staff and owner are very friendly and although the menu is simple, it isn't lacking. I had the chicken and my pruner had the pork with a mild heat. It was delicious! Thank you so much for a wonderful first try of curry. We will definitely be brining in our friends. :)"}
{"text":"This place is so great! Food is amazing, staff is super friendly, and it's always so clean inside. I have been here multiple times and am consistently telling my friends and family to experience Japanese curry at this delicious restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place! Authentic curry flavor & good serving size as well. The prices are also great for the amount of food you get. Also, the owner is super friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Looking for something new and affordable?. Oh curry is the best hidden gem on the east side. Delicious food quiet atmosphere friendly staff. Clean restaurant and just good food. Make sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Great Japanese Curry Restaurant by Japanese owner!  Choose mild, regular or spicy for curry.  They will let you try if you don't know how spicy you can handle.  Very reasonably priced curry with big portion of Tonkatsu or Chicken Katsu.  Per owner, they can do curry with gyoza (pot stickers) or croquette.  They have added a small side salad in a menu.  Don't forget to try coffee jello as a desert :)"}
{"text":"Best Curry in town! Its a genuine Japanese Curry for sure! Yes no doubt about it. I'll definitely be back again when I'm in town"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST AUTHENTIC JAPANESE CURRY!!  I love coming here!! We come from the northwest just to come here!! This place is so trendy and cute!! Love the ambiance!  Come try a plate, and you won't be disappointed!! THE SPICY CURRY IS THE BEST!!"}
{"text":"When I'm near home, this is definitely my go to. I normally make curry at home and this is exactly like it, if not better!  Not everyone can make it into Chinatown every time they want curry. This is probably the best place to go to when you're on the north east side of town. I've lived over here for about 12 years-- it's not the best side but when you're not looking to travel, this is the best thing.  Chicken katsu, the grilled chicken with the curry, the rice and pork-- I'm hungry now, haha. Definitely a place to visit."}
{"text":"I was looking for Japanese Style Curry in Vegas. Was not disappointed! They were friendly fast and delicious. I have been and tried their Regular, Mild, and Hot.   They also have good croquets!"}
{"text":"The very friendly owner is from Tokyo so this is the real deal. The dishes are straightforward in their presentation. It's all about the flavor. Delicious authentic Japanese curry right here in Vegas without spending like you're in a rap video (like so many restaurants here in Vegas which serve such exotic fare. Haha). I love the tonkatsu and the chicken cutlet with curry. The panko coating gives an awesome crunch with the spicy flavor of the curry. I ordered regular spice and it was plenty spicy for me. Wonderful food from a guy you're truly pulling for because he is so nice and really wants you to enjoy what he serves."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique Japanese-style curry. I had a very good experience here. The curry flavor was unique, rich and spicy, almost had a bit of smokiness to it ( I ordered veg curry, regular spice level ). Also, I loved the vibe of the restaurant - casual, open and relaxing. They were playing Air and similar chilled-out music. They were busy, but it was still quiet and comfortable. The staff was very polite and friendly. I left feeling happy and satisfied. I definitely would visit here again."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple days ago w my kids. .i loved it! My kids didn't care for the curry much..it's either u like curry or u don't?! Big portions! Simple menu clean n great service im craving it right now. . I'll b back! Yum!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time today and it was amazing! From the moment we walked through the door we were greeted by Hide, the owner, with a big smile. He asked if it was our first time and proceeded to explain everything on the menu including some fun facts about Japanese curry. He made sure to check on us during our meal and would ask if the food was good. The chicken cutlet curry and curry udon were absolutely delicious but the way we were treated made the experience even more amazing! We will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their food has always been fresh and searing hot. Love the service too,  the ladies here are always friendly and helpful.   I usually eat the chicken or pork with the pickled pepper and curry over rice. I need to try the udon that I have been hearing good things about."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and very tasty food. The chicken cutlet curry was very similar to CoCo Ichibanya. The only improvement I could ask for would be to add Naan to the menu."}
{"text":"Great quality food for an affordable price.  I've been going there quite often for a year now.  They're food is delicious.  You can smell it once you open the door.  Their green tea ice-cream is worth the buy.  The store is very clean and hospitable. I will definitely continue going there."}
{"text":"The curry is great, when I have days where I am feeling down eating here makes me feel better! The curry texture I think is just right for this place and the atmosphere is nice!"}
{"text":"I came here in lunch time and it seems busy around 12:00 p.m. The curry was delicious! I order the chicken cutlet with regular curry the chicken was juicy and crispy .  The girl was really polite and nice. The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because you can see and hear the owner complain about something to the cashier working there when she has a line  people to take orders. I understand is his business and he probably wants things done right the first time, but I believe there is a time and a place to tell your employees what happen and what was the problem."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic curry.  Owner is super involved and welcoming to new customers. Great food, inexpensively priced."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place on while here for a short time. Pleasantly surprised! The waitress/server was extremely nice and helpful. I was stationed in Japan for years and the food is always what I miss from over there. Coco's was a staple and I find this place to settle that homey curry vibe I was missing. Thank goodness this hit the spot. It's no level 10 but their hot will leave your lips tingling.... Try this place you will love it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!  We've been coming to oh curry since the first open and we love the food and the staff!  Always puts a smile on our faces"}
{"text":"So delicious!! Had the chicken, pork, veggies and fries, and it was about $20. Totally enough food to stuff both of us. The curry is perfect, not sweet, but more like a savory gravy. We had the mild, which had no heat, but I could see trying a medium next time. I can't wait to try their other items! Plus the main bonus is that the owner is from Tokyo, so this is authentic! Bring cash for a tip, there was no way to tip with a card at this time and we felt really guilty."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Japan and had Coco's Ichibanya then you probably get that itch for some good Japanese curry. Well this is your spot. The curry here was very similar and absolutely delicious. 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"??!! I have eaten at many a curry place in Japan. Oh curry is --by far-- the most tasteful and authentically Japanese food I have had thus far in the States. I spoke to the owner in Japanese, and he knows what he is doing. Curry and Tonkatsu is crafted with care to perfection, down to the rice and little red Radish (if you have ever had good quality white rice you know what I'm talking about...) I have come back many times and I always leave ?? completely and utterly satisfied. Portions are tailored to fit the American lifestyle and like one of the earlier reviewers said, everything is under $7 , you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Great curry. Staff is extremely friendly. Fast service & did I mention the curry is good???!!!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese food on this side of town! I Eat here every Wednesday when I'm in the neighborhood for work."}
{"text":"I love coming to Oh Curry! I started coming with my boyfriend and our kid and I wasn't all about the curry but it really has grown on me, I love it. We went out of town, and I couldn't wait to get back just to get some of Hides yummy Curry.  His restaurant is beautiful. He cares, and does a wonderful job."}
{"text":"Amazing curry, I've had Coco Ichi and as of recently their quality in the food has gone down. Coming to this place reminded me how good Japanese curry is. I'd definitely come here again. I'd recommend the chicken cutlet curry with cheese. The owner is from Tokyo and he cooks authentic Japanese curry. I spent around $8 for the curry which is a good deal in my opinion. The only down side is lack of toppings. I would've loved scrambled eggs in my curry. Also the spice levels should be fixed. I got the regular spice and it seemed like it was just mild. Other than that I had a good time."}
{"text":"Awesome curry! I tried their noodle version and it was so good. They also have this desert called Orange Dream and it was so good! They are also expanding their menu with new items. The service is excellent!   The first time I came to this place, I asked if they had chopsticks, but they didn't have any. But the owner went to the market next door and got some for me. He went above and beyond on customer satisfaction. I will come again to this place since it is on my side of town."}
{"text":"Location is not safety.  There is only one person arrange register and waitress.  Way to long to place order and wait for the foods.    Price is affordable.  Very salty curry flavor!!  You should try \"Zen curry\" and compare a taste. The gentleman who takes care of front is wearing long hair.  No hair on my food!! Red flag!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for this place.  This is my favorite place for Japanese-style curry.  I love their GENEROUS PORTIONS and the RICH TASTE.   I usually get the hot tonkatsu curry, and it is the BEST! The thickness and the crispy-ness is just right. I recommend it if you're good with spicy food. My mom says the hot curry is too spicy for her, so she gets the regular curry.   The waiting time could vary depending on the number of orders in front, so I like to call ahead and order for my whole family and pick it up. The owner and the employee is always FRIENDLY. I would definitely recommend this place. The price is very affordable, too. They also have a stamp card where you get a free one after the eighth purchase. The place has bright lighting, so it is hard to miss it from the outside."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and the owner is so friendly. I love coming here. It's quite and very good. The curry is definitely cooked well. Thank you for being awesome. I will return again soon with people who haven't been here before. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place quite often since its on my way to work, and my plans for today were changed... so I figured I'd take my mom to lunch.  Oh! Curry is very clean, quiet and the staff are very sweet and helpful.  The owner even came out as we were leaving and he is quite charming.  The food is phenomenal, I have had Japanese curry before, but the flavors of this were out of this world.  (I even ordered the mild and it was far from bland) Never thought I would find food like this in a strip mall setting.  They are expanding their menu, so I got the combo chicken cutlet and tonkatsu.  They have a coffee kanten for desert that I would just stop by there from now on just to get.  The prices are very reasonable and this place beats the heck out of any place nearby.  I will definitely be back and probably quite often.  If you are ever in the neighborhood, or even if you aren't... its worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The best experience ever! Mr. Hide, the owner, greeted us as soon as we walked in and made us feel at home. It was our first time there and he explained to us his dishes. Nice environment and amazing food! As he was preparing our food, you can tell that he values his employees and his customers. We ordered the chicken dish and the noddle bowl. Both were amazing! Mr. Hide if you see this, you are awesome!"}
{"text":"I seriously drove past this place almost everyday and am glad that I read about it on yelp...so delicious. I could literally eat their curry sauce everyday. As a bonus, their hot sauce is actually fairly hot, which is hard to find. If in the area, for sure give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Very nice employees and good food would love to go again :) since it was such a fast service"}
{"text":"The food is amazing my favorite is the fried chicken curry...they have a  very good coffee twist  dessert  5 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"Living on the East side of Vegas there isn't many options to get good food. So after finding this place I couldn't have been any happier. Their food is great for such a low price. It is definitely the best curry in town, 11/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"If you're craving curry this is the spot to go. The tonkotsu is really good,  but my favorite is the vegetable croquette. Trust me do not pass on this. The owner and staff are really nice as well making this a must, whenever I'm in the area. Oh! Curry why you so good!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Staff were very friendly and speedy. The portions were large and filling,"}
{"text":"The tonkatsu curry is very ono! Reminds me of Hawai'i local grinds. I was skeptical of the area but the food is legit.  I'll definitely be back to try other items on the menu.    Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Not quite on level with zen curry, but lower priced and still a good flavor. Only saw 3 spice options, though everyone enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"Oh Curry! Is the best! I've never tried curry before coming here and it was awesome. The owner and the staff are really nice! When I went to oh curry for the first time I ordered the chicken cullet curry and it was great! They have the choice whether to get your curry regular, mild or hot so you can add a bit of spice to your meal. Even though it's a small place they still do deliveries, which is awesome for people that don't want to leave their homes and still get delicious curry! Don't hesitate to stop by you won't regret trying Oh Curry!"}
{"text":"I had the pork tonkatsu and must say it had the right amount of heat for me. The chicken cutlet was perfectly breaded and the chicken was moist. My acquaintance had mentioned that she would prefer the chicken cutlet vs the grilled. While the menu was limited. I enjoyed eating here. The service was friendly. Enjoyed the personalization from the owner to check how everything was. If you're on the east side of town, this is a spot."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe my luck when I found out an authentic Japanese curry house opened not too far from work.  The curry is delicious and the tonkatsu tender.  Been hitting it up for lunch twice a week.  Hasn't disappointed yet.  Great addition to Las Vegas growing number of authentic Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"There is a shortage of good restaurants on the east side. I'm glad I finally found this place. Had the Tonkatsu curry hot. Very good. Great portions."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my fave curry places in Vegas! Nothing on the menu is over $7.00 - It's definitely a lot of food for the price! You can choose to have your curry at mild, medium or hot. My personal favorite is the chicken cutlet curry (you can also opt to have the chicken grilled if you want it!). First timers at the restaurant get a discount as well - be sure to check out the flyer for the different coupons.  Fun fact: The owner is going to start offering Curry Dogs on his menu!  Yummmm"}
{"text":"I love Japanese curry and I'm super excited that the restaurant is close to where I stay (Eastside Las Vegas).  There are two other Japanese Curry restaurants in Las Vegas but you have to go to China Town to eat there.  The food was great (I ordered the chicken cutlet with cheese) and reminded me of Coco Ichibanya in Okinawa but better!  The food portions are much larger than Kaba Curry and Zen Curry.  The restaurant is also way bigger.  The location is kind of off to the side so just look out for it.    The service was great and they offered plenty of coupons and everything was reasonably priced.  Food came out pretty quickly and the owner came out and was very friendly and spoke to us as well."}
{"text":"Best curry place in Vegas! 10/10 would recommend. The owners are very nice, inside of the restaurant is very clean, and the best part is the curry!!!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed with the service and food! I'm so happy I came here and I will be returning! The owner was very friendly and gave me great recommendations. You have to try this place and I'm sure you'll love it!"}
{"text":"My co-worker found this little gem. She ordered take out and brought her lunch back to the office. The aroma and looks of her lunch prompted me to stop in. What a delicious treat! The restaurant atmosphere is very clean, smooth jazz playing in the back ground and incredibly friendly staff.  Not to mention the scrumptious chicken curry cutlet dish. The prices are very reasonable. I encourage anyone to check this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Ultimate Japanese comfort food.  Got the spicy pork cutlet and it was just right."}
{"text":"Love the food, its really good.. Come here almost everyday.. Love the way they treat you here they have a really nice serves. My favorite plate is the chicken curry with a side of fried chicken.."}
{"text":"Had Curry House Coco in Hawaii and was always a fan.   So lucky that I found this gem of a restaurant. Oh! Curry is the real deal when it comes to Japanese curry. I am but only visiting from Oklahoma, but I can say that Las Vegas, you are quite lucky to have this place.   The curry was delicious and had the perfect seasoning. The katsu was fried perfectly and so delicious. The combo of the katsu, curry, and the rice was a treat for my taste buds. This meal is exactly what the doctor ordered on a rainy Vegas day.  I think I prefer this place over Curry House Coco actually. The owner and the staff are quite friendly as well, greeting every customer with a friendly smile.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friend took me to this curry place. The owner and the employee are very nice and friendly. I ordered chicken katsu curry. It was good. I would want to come back."}
{"text":"If you're looking to eat plain curry, this is the place the go.  The person taking our order was very nice, however it seemed that she didn't know much about japanese curry.  The pictures on the menu are spot on, if you want to call that a good thing. The food comes out on a huge plate with a mound of rice and the curry sauce with whatever you ordered on it (i.e. tonkatsu, chicken pieces, etc/). It's like the curry is, to put it simply, a curry block you can buy at the store melted into water. That's all it is, nothing really authentic about it.  I would never go back. I would rather waste 10$ by going to Ihop across the street."}
{"text":"First time trying Japanese Curry and I'm in love! The owner was super friendly and helpful since I didn't know what I was ordering. I was going to order to go but he suggested since it was my first time trying this curry, it would be best to eat in. Did not disappoint. Food was bomb!! Good portions too. Looking forward to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Went in to satisfy my curry craving. And the staff there was really nice to me. I got it to go and when I got home I couldn't believe how good it was. Once I finished I ended up wanting more because it was so good! Second time I went, I dined in and it was  a LOT! Almost felt like I was going into a food coma. I love the pork and the hottest curry they got. Its a great place and the food is super good definitely a must for all the curry lovers."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty clean & nice. The workers are friendly, there's a variety of different ways you could choose from to have a curry. Also they've a kids menu too."}
{"text":"Great homemade Japanese Curry!! You can taste the authenticity. Simple Small selection but enough! Owner is great, friendly, and helpful! Great vibes, definitely will be back again and again! Thank you! And they use REAL red chilis to spice up your order! Not just powders or dried flakes like other places."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, inexpensive, and quick... Definitely reccomend! The cashier, who I believe to be the owner was very personable, and everything was good, I had tonkotzu with gyoza and it was very"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Curry taste amazing at a very nice price. The owner is extremely nice and you can tell he really cares about his customers and his restraunt. They're also available on postmates and uber eats now. And if you're into that whole Japanese anime vibe then you'll like it there too since sometimes they okay Japanese music. It's good food just try it."}
{"text":"I hope this place sticks around. The shopping center corner theyre in has definitely been getting better but besides that....food is good, the place is bright and clean and people are nice."}
{"text":"A coworker told me about this place and said it was great so I had to try it. Pretty good curry! We went in at the perfect time too so it wasn't overly crowded and the service was super fast."}
{"text":"If I could give 4.5 stars I would! This place is on par with coco ichibanya curry (in the United States); though the choices of meats aren't as many. You get a choice of 3 different levels for their curry sauce - mild regular or spicy. I chose regular and from 1-10 (10 being super spicy) I'll say regular was around 5-6 so be ready for a little kick when ordering regular sauce. The owner's name is \"hide\" and he was very nice and very humble. I love how they also have a purchase reward card where you can earn a free meal after 8 stamps!"}
{"text":"This place seems so out of place in this neighborhood. The owner and the worker were both Asian, but you wouldn't really expect a curry place here.  The food was ok. I have definitely had better, but not to say it wasn't good. Got spicy curry and it was slightly too spicy for me. Drank a lot of water.   An ok place for those wanting curry in an area that doesn't really offer this genre of food."}
{"text":"Had the chicken cutlet curry here and it was absolutely amazing, full of authentic flavor !! The service was sooooo great as well! It's amazing pleasure to see such great customer service! The owner himself was a really nice guy ! I'd come back here and highly recommend others to do the same!"}
{"text":"Employees are very friendly, amazing food, and giant portions! I got the Tonkatsu Curry meal with the spice level at regular. The curry is rich and flavourful and not at all spicy. (You can increase your spice level if you'd like) The prices are all fairly cheap and if you dine-in, extra rice is no cost! Great place for a quick, cheap, yet quality bite."}
{"text":"The chicken Katsu curry is the BEST I've had in Las Vegas. The curry is flavorful and portions are generous,especially for the price. Since finding this place, I haven't been able to enjoy any other curry houses in town. The only downside which hasn't really bothered me is that they only have three spice levels- regular, mild, and hot (compared to a 1-10 scale like some other places). Overall, I highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Just go. It's the best curry I've ever had. If you haven't tried Japanese curry, hurry here and order the regular tonkatsu curry. Go."}
{"text":"Update, this is still my favorite place to eat ! I've wandered across other curry places or places that have curry, I have not tried them for fear that it may not be as good as Oh Curry. The price still stands and is still cheaper, the food is always good, the service and staff are always good. I am happy to be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab a relatively quick dinner and I'm so glad this place popped up. The owner, Hide, is super welcoming - I didn't feel awkward eating alone. The curry udon was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend for the authenticity and vibes."}
{"text":"This place is too good, authentic Japanese curry with as much rice as you want!!  the owner is super friendly as well as other staff."}
{"text":"Recommend it!  So far best in vegas for Japanese curry. My favorite choice is vegetable with hot (spicy) curry, i like to add corn extra pickles and croquette.  End it with dessert coffee twist.  Clean environment friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for authentic Japanese curry. The only concern about the place is the lack of items you can add to the curry, i.e. weiners, spinach, ect.. if you know Japanese style curry. The owner is a great person to talk to if you ever miss Japan. I highly recommend this place. I gave it 4 out of 5 due to the lack of items and maybe bigger portions wouldn't hurt the menu. But it was great."}
{"text":"I eat here for lunch every once in a while, and it saddens me a bit that this place is empty around lunch time! It feels like it'll eventually lose its business due to having barely any traffic coming through here. Buts its a really good place! Portions are good for the price you pay. Vegetable curry is the cheapest, and they give you barely any vegetables, so order a side. The curry sauce is great at hot level, and the meat is cooked very well. Soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, unless doused in curry. Give this place a try, it deserves more business"}
{"text":"I use to be stationed in Misawa Japan years ago, so when I found this place I was very excited!  Me and a co worker went here for lunch and the staff was very friendly, the owner was from Tokyo, so I knew the food was going to be good/authentic   I elected to get the chicken curry cutlet with an extra chicken cutlet.. I got spice level: Hot..  10-15 min later our food came out, the presentation was on point! The food was pretty good, the Hot spice level wasn't too spicy but it was enough to give you the \"sniffles\"..My only complaint is that my chicken was kind of dry!  If I am back in the area, I will give them another try.."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food is delicious! They have 3 levels of spice. Mild, which is not spicy. Regular, which is in between (What I usually get). And Hot, which is pretty spicy.   I always order the Chicken Cutlet Curry. The food is always fresh! Good prices. The lady at the counter is always very nice, she always says to let her know if we need anything. Customer service is great, the place is always super clean and tidy. Even the bathrooms are well kept! I love that it has some anime posters, I'd love to see more! ^-^ I am a regular, and will be for as long as they are open. c:"}
{"text":"Wow, legit Japanese curry!! I walked in for take-out at like 8:15pm (they close at 8:30 today). I kind of half-expected to be turned away but the owner still welcomed me and even talked about their menu 15 min before shutting down. Very nice and respectful, a great place to get quick food that actually tastes really good! I think mine came out in like 7 min. I would recommend to all of my friends o  the East side!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The menu/ special is a must try. We've been coming here for several times and it never disappoints. My favorites is their chicken curry with added vegetables . During my recent trip, I tried the udon and added rice. Again, I was not disappointed. Service is amazing also, one call and you can get your order ready on time. Stop by and try Oh! Curry"}
{"text":"This place is great! I always get the combination curry plate. I'll also order the ice cream to eat while I wait. Its always been quiet when I went. The cashier is always this nice, older gentlemen. Yall gotta check it out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Definitely rivals Coco Ichiban. The gyoza were really good and the curry was exceptional. If you are sensitive to spicy definitely stick to mild.  My daughter (5 yrs) who usually just eats the meat out of the curry sat and actually ate the curry itself very happily, and didn't seem to care that it was a bit spicier than she was used to.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Japanese curry spot! My husband and I recently took a trip to Okinawa, Japan for vacation  to visit friends and they introduced us to the well known awesome restaurant \"coco's curry\" and this place is just like that! Owner hide is so nice, but we did experience some of the best service and genuinely kind people in Japan so we weren't surprised by his excellent service. We got the combo pork katsu and chicken cutlet katsu which was great, curry was perfect flavor and consistency. I also ordered the side salad which had sesame dressing just like the kind we've had at coco's curry in Japan. Prices are very reasonable especially with the good size portions u get. The owner also offered us free dessert since it was our first time and they also offer military discount, just make sure to ask before they place your order. This place is kind of a drive for us from North Las Vegas but definitely worth it for our Japanese curry cravings. We'll definitely be frequent customers :)"}
{"text":"For some authentic Japanese curry in Las Vegas, look no further! When you get it spicy, it isn't exactly spicy, as my friend would say, it is white people hot."}
{"text":"I guess when other Japanese curry options are clear across town, you gotta take what you can get. This location is pretty bare-bones but the service is really friendly and the menu has a lot of different options, including various meats for your curry and sides of different croquettes. They have dessert option, too!  The tonkatsu curry is most often recommended in the reviews, so I opted for that with a medium heat level and the coffee jello dessert. Started with the sweets because that's just how I roll, and was surprised at the quality. Not something I'd usually like, but solid and unique. The curry though? Good-size portion for a good price. But the curry sauce that makes the dish was bland and almost flavorless. I guess I should have upped the spice, but the sauce itself should have had flavor aside from just heat, and I didn't find this to be the case.   I can't say I'd come here for curry again, and looking through some other reviews I'm not the only one underwhelmed by the curry sauce. Hope they kick it up a notch: being the only option on this side of town shouldn't be an excuse to slack off."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is one of my favorite spots to eat at. The curry is absolutely amazing and delicious. Check them out it will be worth your time everything there is fresh and the people are very nice."}
{"text":"I came in for the first time. The owner was super friendly and wore a smile. He described dishes that I may have liked. The flavor was good.. However, a bit overpriced for what you get. I ordered the curry chicken cutlets. You get white rice and alot of curry sauce but very little meat. I might return and order something else."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food - OMG Curry Chicken and ice creams will be back soon !!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious, spicy Japanese curry. Reasonably priced and the owner is super friendly. He was willing to go over the menu with us and tell us about new items."}
{"text":"The curry is absolutely superb! I would recommend getting the hot spicy combo; which includes rice, tonkatsu, and fried chicken cutlet. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"So learned that I love Japanese curry which I wasn't aware of myself. Oh curry is a small restaurant that w couple of friends always recommended it to me so I went and wasn't disappointed. Oh! Curry's atmosphere is friendly and inviting. The staff greet me the moment I step in to the restaurant with a simple hello and a genuine smile. I'm really picky about where I eat so it has to be clean,good thing Oh Curry is spotless! The food is simple and delicious anything you choose is the right choice. The staff is every friendly even offering free kids meals w/ toys to families that have kids. My friends and I come to oh curry just about everyday just to hang out talk and play Pokemon. I wish more people knew about it"}
{"text":"Really awesome Japanese  food! Tonkatsu Curry is on point! Croquettes satisfied my cravings as well especially withe JPop playing on the background . My go to place for  curry!"}
{"text":"I really liked the curry here. However the only drawback is a very limited menu. Overall though the place is good for a quick curry plate."}
{"text":"Best japanese curry place in Vegas for price. Have yet to find a place to beat the combo curry deal. So filling and delicious for such a good price. Curry Udon was one of the best I've ever had. Noodles were perfect."}
{"text":"Loved it. Try the Tonkatsu! And get the Orange Dream. Places with simple menus like this are always the best."}
{"text":"Been coming here at least once a month since they opened.  Easy simple dishes, just slam packed with that delicious brown curry flavor.     Plenty of options if you like hot-spicey, but the base curry itself is amazing. I generally order curry udon, as well as chicken cutlet.    My son was 6 months old the first time we came in, gave him some curry on his pacifier, can't walk in the restaurant now without him getting excited.    Hope they are around for a while."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If you've ever had CoCo's this place is for you. The service is great and free refills and free rice. Price is definitely worth it. They also do UberEats."}
{"text":"This is the BEST curry hands down!  And awesome service from the owner!  The wait isn't bad even with people here!  To satisfy my craving for Curry I always come here!  I forgot to take a picture of my Tonkatsu before devouring the whole plate.  It's the right about of curry and tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty good curry on this side of town.  The customer service was outstanding.  I wish they made their curry spicier but i will settle for not so spicy."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and every time the food is very good. The shop aesthetically is kinda bland but but still a great place to go if you're in the area!   P.S The Katsu Curry is bomb"}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese curry. Pretty similar to Coco curry or another quick curry place like that. The owner and his wife were very nice and accommodating. Don't forget the extra free rice if you're feeling extra hungry"}
{"text":"Oh! Curry is a pleasant surprise: Japanese Curry dishes that are tasty and affordable.   We were visiting Las Vegas + drove around looking for somewhere affordable to eat, off the Vegas Strip. We ended up at Oh! Curry located in a small strip mall. Most, if not all, entrees were $6.99 My daughters and I each had chicken curry (with grilled chicken) and my husband had the vegetable curry. Each plate was simple: steamed white rice, a generous serving of thick, savory curry sauce + cut up chicken (or sautéed vegetables). The portions were good: we don't have large appetites so each plate was enough, however it might not be enough for larger appetites.   The restaurant had coupons for free items so we chose the free kid's meal, which was rice, 2 chicken nuggets, a serving of curry sauce and French fries.   There was only one guy manning the register. He brought the food out to us and later took back the dirty dishes. The food was brought out as it became ready, so 2 of us got our meals, then the next 2 and a little later, the rest of the meals came out. We didn't mind this, but I know some people like all the meals brought out at the same time.   The meals were served on regular plates, with silverware. Paper napkins were available at the counter. We got fountain sodas, so nothing fancy. The decor is very simple + plain.    There are information leaflets on the history of curry in Japan. It's a nice read while you're waiting for your food and it was pretty informative. It's clear that the owners know what they're doing and they're proud of what they do.   The restroom was clean and tidy. The ladies room was a single stall, large enough to be accessible for those with disabilities.   So in conclusion, Oh! Curry offers delicious food at a reasonable price. Service is friendly, decor is plain. Great choice if you're hungry."}
{"text":"This is my new Japanese Curry spot!!!  In my opinion it better then Zen curry for sure!  If you have ever had Coco Itchibanya Curry House in Hawaii this is the closest you will find in Vegas! The location is a bit far from me but well worth the drive don't let the location scare you. The food is well worth it. I went with my son and My Dad which i will say we're leery about the place. After we all ordered 2 chicken katsu curries one regular and mild with a side of the potato croquettes and 1 spicy pork cutlet. We were all amazed how delicious the curry was. There pickled radish was the best in town especially with my rice and curry. The katsu was the bomb cooked just right not to tough like a lot of these places serving katsu here in  Vegas. It is a definite must try a hidden gem for us locals! To top it off the gentleman in the restaurant who may be the owner was kind, friendly and knowledgeable we talked a bit about all the curry spots her and different Japanese restaurants in town. I can tell he enjoys good authentic food as much as i do!"}
{"text":"A very good quality and clean Curry restaurant on the east side of Las Vegas! Very friendly staff and chef! Food is amazing quality, low price, and in big portions. Very relaxing and nonchalant ambience in the restaurant. Perfect for gatherings with friends or family! Highly recommend this place to anyone who likes Asian foods or curry!"}
{"text":"Let me start off my saying, this is the best curry in Las Vegas! I've been to other places in Vegas and they are more popular but they are a lot more expensive and offer you less food. After finding out about Oh Curry I fell in love. I am always catching myself eat here. The owner is very nice and courteous, he always checks up to make sure your meal is good. I get the chicken cutlet hot and a side a fries with a calpico. So good and still budget friendly. Definitely my favorite Japanese curry place in Las Vegas. Visit Hide and give it a try, it won't be your last time in, the curry is addicting!"}
{"text":"Love there curry here, staff is always nice and friendly, place is clean. My kids love eating the kids plate. I enjoy the tofu one or  the tonkatsu curry."}
{"text":"Their curry chicken katsu is delish. If you get the mild curry you won't really get the full curry flavor, so my suggestion is to get the regular curry. It's not very spicy, it has just the right amount of kick.   The Japanese gentleman who takes care of the front of the house is very nice and kind.   Note: Call in advance if you're planning to pick up your order. If you use Eat 24 they might not receive your order since Eat 24 has to call them to verbally place your order even though you've placed your order through their app."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is terrific!! The staff/owners are so great, they make the food even more wonderful...... The BEST Curry Ever!!"}
{"text":"This place has changed my life forever. I have never been more giddy driving to go get food in my life. Such a wide variety of dishes and all done so well. My personal favorite would be the grilled chicken, tofu steak after becoming vegetarian. Cashier is always the same dude and he's the best. 10/10 would fill out my stamp card again"}
{"text":"Let me tell you. I'm a big fan of curry. This is 10/10! I got the chicken cutlet curry, in mild. It taste so juicy and the sauce is amazing. Their rice is cooked to absolute perfection. Their building is cute too! Love the anime posters and Japanese portraits."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing,clean, and very friendly.  Authentic being stationed in Japan as good as co-cos"}
{"text":"Just had the tonkatsu/chicken cutlet combo and damn it was good. It wasnt CoCos but it was STILL good as hell and definitely satisfies the CoCos cravings. Hide is very respectful as well. Will be back again probably tomorrow lol"}
{"text":"Great Japanese Curry place. Clean, affordable with great prices.... Definitely been here more than once. Never been disappointed..."}
{"text":"So I've been thinking about coming to this place for a while now...  Living on the other side of town, there's another Japanese curry place that is more convenient to get to, but is definitely not as authentic.  I ordered the hot curry and it was just like I was back in Japan, wandering around Tokyo Station when I was a kid. Curry rice was a staple for me when I was there, as when I was younger I didn't really care for grilled fish and sushi which seemed to be everywhere. While there are other places which sell Japanese curry here in town, none of them have the flavor that this one does.  The owner is very friendly, and says he is from Tokyo.  It shows in his curry, as it tastes just like it should.   If you're close by and have never tried Japanese curry, definitely stop in and have some. The prices are good for the portion size and the service is great. Even if you're nowhere close, and you want to know what REAL Japanese curry tastes like, it's definitely worth the drive. They also have delivery with BiteLV & Uber Eats.  We'll be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This place was good. But just good. The service was slow but the guy told us that ahead of time. It's good curry but i didn't want to wait 20 minutes for it.  The big draw there seemed to be with the take out. The place always had someone in and out. Again, I would try it again but probably just do the take out option."}
{"text":"All i can say is if you Havn't tried this restaurant you are missing out. Excellent everything."}
{"text":"Just dined here for the first time. The front service staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. I was a little thrown off that I couldn't pay extra for snap peas because the owner was not there at the time. She did however offer samples of the curry since it was our first time.  As for the food, I felt it had good flavor but, the sizes were extremely to large. After a few bites it was to much of the same flavor and texture. Loved the potato cakes and thought they were the best part of the meal.  I gave a lower score as well due to the soft drink fountain not being fully operational. All they offered to drink were canned green tea, another soda, and bottle water. Not to mention they were out of beef by 3 pm. If you have a business I feel that you need to be 100% all the time in a competitive town such as this. I wish this place the very best and based on the reviews it has a very loyal customer base. Hopefully we caught them on a off day."}
{"text":"Great service and I can't wait till I go there again it's been forever since I was last there a lot of places in that area and this one has stayed up the last time before this one was two years ago. But glad it's still there can't wait to go"}
{"text":"I finally went in, just to get a menu, but the aroma was so intoxicating that I got food to go, right on the spot.  The restaurant is spotless and the nice girl behind the counter was busy cleaning the whole time i was there.  The food was well packaged, with the curry separate so the food would not get soggy, and it was taped closed so it could not leak! Awesome! The food was fantastic!  Salad was delicious and fresh, with a creamy sesame seed dressing. The veggies were very flavorful, and the rice was cooked perfectly.  The curry was divine!  Different from Indian curry.  Seems more hearty.  All of the cooked food was nice and hot (in temperature.) And the spicy curry is definitely hot but still packed with incredible flavor.  You can tell how good it will be by the aroma as soon as you enter!  I wish there were more vegetarian options, such as eggplant or tofu, or ??? And personally, I would love it if they offered brown rice as an option.  I can't wait to try the coffee and orange dream jellos next time.  This is absolutely my favorite place now!!!! It is also the healthiest and freshest food I have found in this area, by far! I wish I had tried it sooner!"}
{"text":"WHY: WOOHOOO!! There is finally a Japanese curry place on the East Side!! THAT'S WHY! =D  WHO: Bring your entire family!! I believe they do a free meal for kids if you eat there (check me on how many kids though, lol).  WHEN: Monday through Saturday they are open from noon-9pm, Sundays from noon to 8pm.  WHERE: In the small plaza on the corner of Nellis & Stewart (right beside Shell gas station).  WHAT: First and foremost... Can I get a HALLELUJAH?!  I am so thankful that this Cute Curry Cafe (you like that alliteration, don't you? Lol) opened right down the street from my house!! (because I randomly have curry cravings).   Japanese curry is a fusion of different spices from Asia, and is certainly delicious and Tasty! It comes in three levels of spiciness: Mild, Regular, & Hot. There are different combos such as Tonkatsu (Pork cutlet) curry, Vegetable with curry, chicken with curry, and you can even request their fried chicken with curry. Whatever you choose is a good choice, but I personally recommend the Tonkatsu curry! It is just worth your TIME AND MONEY!  On the dessert end, they have an Orange jello called the \"Orange Dream\" topped with whipped cream. NOTE** If you're curious and willing to try, they have this BOMB.ORG coffee jello topped with whipped cream. It's not on the menu yet, but ASK FOR IT! It is absolutely REFRESHING!  & If the curry, rice & your choice combo doesn't seem to suffice your TUMMY, try the french fries with curry, or the fried chicken with curry, where the curry acts as a dipping sauce.   Decor-wise walking in, it is bright orange and definitely brightens my mood! It is a peaceful place to eat, and the employees are absolute darlings! It will definitely become my second home soon. =X hahaha.  Random: A few days ago I chose to bring one of my friends here, and it was the perfect timing because the owner happened to be there! =) He is such a friendly Japanese man who is all SMILES! I got to chat with him a bit and SECRET... he is going to start serving CURRY UDON! That I am freaking excited for! CURRY ON NOODLES?! WHO COULD REFUSE?! - I CAN'T!  So come down to the East, and take a look-see, you will definitely enjoy it! Try the coffee jello, and I will fill you all in when Curry Udon is up on the menu!   =D SMILES!"}
{"text":"This will be a Problem, so close to my house!  We sampled today, being our first visit. Pork was good, curry was ok. Fries were FAB, extra crispy, and we got regular curry with it. Tasted just like the ones I had in Japan. Got both mellow, Orange was good, but the coffee....OMG....soooo good. I do not like hot coffee just cold. It is served with whipped cream and French vanilla coffee creamer....Will be perfect when it's a billion degrees this summer.  Will be back to try more soon!"}
{"text":"I am a new Japanese Curry convert. It's sooooo good. If only there was one closer to my house. Hide is a great person and deserves all the success coming his way. If you're on the Northside of Vegas, make sure to checkout Oh! Curry."}
{"text":"Best Curry I have had since coming back to the U.S. from living in Korea. Minus the Curry my wife makes, of course ;)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat authentic Japanese Curry. 7 years in Japan reminded me of home. Chicken & pork are tender. Coffee Dream dessert is great way to finish off the meal. Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"You know how sometimes you crave like really good, authentic Japanese curry without having to pay like a lot? Well, this place is affordable and ahhhh-mazing. I'm a vegetarian and usually a lot of nearby places aren't vegan/vegetarian friendly. But the staff was nice enough to customize my order. All in all if you live on the east side of Vegas and  want affordable curry that taste like it should cost a lot, stop by plus they have some pretty great deals!! I guess you can say that I'm a regular customer and a fan of all their tasty food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! definite a rare gem of a restaurant on the East side! food is amazing and the owner Hide is so nice and welcoming. Must try the tonkutsu curry here!!"}
{"text":"Best curry in town! I find myself craving it every single day!! Service is excellent, and food is so very fresh. This location is so much better than curry zen on spring mountain, and the prices are amazing!!!! The owner is so nice and always makes sure that he makes the order just the way you want it. I love this place and I will definitely recommend oh curry to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch, was craving chicken katsu curry...it certainly did not disappoint! Being from Hawaii, I love Curry House...if you are looking for a curry place... this is a must try...and the owner Hide is really nice...The mild curry was delicious...I even told Hide that it was better than Curry House back home.  Will be back soon for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend and we had time to come and try and boy oh boy we are glad that we did.   If you know Japanese curry and you like it, then you have to give this place a try. They have three levels of spice... Mild, medium and hot. If you are not familiar with their level of spice, you can ask them for a sample to see what level would be good for you.  I got the hot and in the beginning it was just fine but after a couple of spoonfuls,the heat kicked in and sweat started to bead on my lip and I knew I should of got the medium instead. Haha but I enjoyed every last scoop of the curry.  The chicken katsu was a little on the thin side but it was breaded nice and golden brown with  nice white pieces of chicken.   If you need more rice, you can ask for more (no charge).   Still hungry?  You can try one of their desserts. They have a coffee twist and orange dream along with green tea or red bean ice cream ($1.39).   All in all this place rocks and the curry is authentic. The owner Hide is from Tokyo and brings down the Tokyo style to Las Vegas. Thank you Hide San!"}
{"text":"The owner is always super friendly and the food is amazing. I highly recommend the combo curry, it comes with the tonkatsu and chicken katsu with curry and rice."}
{"text":"This is the place for real Japanese Curry. It's a hidden gem. I had the Tonkatsu Curry and it was just like being back in Tokyo. Authentic and Tasty. I live on the other side of town and I'll drive all the way back."}
{"text":"They're curry is really tasty which is the reason for my four stars. It would be great if they had add ons like egg, corn ect"}
{"text":"Good and fast service! Very friendly and helpful staff!! Got my food to go and I was extremely satisfied on how my food was packaged! They make sure nothing spills over!  And the food was delicious!! The udon soup was my fav also the chicken cutlet!!"}
{"text":"I visited Oh! Curry today while visiting my grandparents. They live in the east side of town that is heavily Hispanic so food choices tend to be limited to taquerias, fast food, diners and occasional Chinese food, so this curry house was a refreshing surprise.  We walked in and found the restaurant to be spacious and exceedingly clean. The cashier/server was immediately helpful in assisting us and wanted to help us if this had been out first curry experience. She answered all our questions (this being my grandparents first curry experience) and promptly rang is up.   We got our soft drinks from the dispenser and sat down. We observed and commented on the giant sign on the wall that explained what Japanese curry is to the customer in Spanish, which I think was a smart move on the owners part considering the location of the restaurant.  The food was served quickly on cafeteria trays. The portions are very large so expect to leave very full or take home leftovers. This is usually the case though because rice is essentially half the dish. Dude note, extra rice is free for dine-in.   We ordered tonkatsu curry, beef curry, fried chicken and French fries. The curry itself is very reminiscent of Golden Curry that you can buy out of a box, but more flavorful with different spices. I'm not usually an avid curry fan, but I really enjoyed this curry. We all got mild because we don't like spicy food.   The tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) was a little bland as in it needed salt, but otherwise moist and crunchy. The beef was sort of like roast meat, not like stew meat, but it was very tender and flavorful. I didn't try the fried chicken, but was told it was good. The breading is a thicker Japanese style, so don't expect KFC. The fries were amazing! Fresh and crunchy with great flavor. I would go back just for the fries.   Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and the curry. It's not quite as expensive as sit down restaurant curry (this is fast food curry). It's delicious at the right price (about $7 per dish). They have a rewards card where you buy 8 curry dishes and get one free. They offer delivery within 3 miles for $2 and a minimum $15 purchase (which is very reasonable). I look forward to visiting again the next time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Oh! Curry and it was delicious! The owner explained the menu to us before we ordered as one of us had never had Japanese curry before. The wait for the food did not take long at all. The portions are perfect: just enough that you clean your plate but leave full. On top of that, the service was wonderful. The owner made sure to check on us and let us know that if we needed more rice for our curry we could have it. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wonder if this place is named after Sadaharu Oh, because this place knocked it out of the ball park for their Japanese style curry.   Who would have thought that a East side Las Vegas strip center would have a hidden Japanese owned treasure.  If you didn't already know, I love my Japanese style curry, and even was awarded a ROTD for another curry house review in Las Vegas, but for some reason...I kind of like this place a little better.  Even though the past week, I made a pot of Japanese style curry at home, and hammered it, I still had a craving for it this weekend.  So I followed my bookmark, then ventured out this part of town.   Okay, I know what a few of you are thinking, East Las Vegas, and who the heck would come out here?   This is what I believe, some of the best places are located in the hood, for example, Honey Kettle fried chicken in Compton, and some of best tacos in the valley are just up the street from Oh! Curry.   Walking into Oh! Curry is unlike most of the area, because I was very impressed on how clean this restaurant was, and how friendly the staff made you feel.  The prices was very inexpensive compared to the other curry house in the valley, and their serving size was much larger than the competitors.   My order of the Tonkatsu curry was very good, and Oh! curry had a bolder, but sweeter flavor, and had a smoother milky consistency than Zen.  At $6.99, it was more than enough to make the me happy, and if I wanted more rice it would have been no extra charge for it.   Too bad, I didn't take picture of this dish, because it didn't stand a chance, and there wasn't a grain of rice on the plate.  Good stuff.  I thought of about the Orange dream while first ordering my meal, and why not...I was in bliss with the last dish.  So what the heck, how much calories can jello dessert really have!   Some how, the young lady got me thinking about their other flavor, Coffee!   As soon as the spoon hit this dessert, I was smiling because I haven't had Kanten in ages.  It was good!  Thinking about Oh! Curry, I'm stunned that this place is located so far from most Japanese folks in the Las Vegas valley, but on the other hand, Oh! Curry venturing out of their comfort zone will make anyone a fan of Japan's comfort dishes,  Oh! well, like what the famous saying in the movie, Field of Dream...Build it and they will come!   I have a feeling they will."}
{"text":"Oh Curry is a little place across the alley from the Nellis and Stewart Walmart and across Stewart from Ci Ci's Pizza buffet. You can drive by it if you aren't looking for it, which is a pity because it's worth finding, which is why I'm spending so much time telling you where it's at. They are new so don't let the small number of reviews fool you, they're really good!   First of all the restaurant was spotless. The lady at the counter asked me  if I'd had Japanese curry before and let me try some. She was very friendly and helpful. Japanese curry is a little different from Indian and Asian curries, more like a rich brown gravy.  If you're sensitive to the coconut milk in the other curries try Japanese curry.  I chose the pork tonkatsu which is a breaded and fried pork cutlet with rice and gravy. It was as good as tonkatsu that I've had at other Japanese restaurants for twice the price. I also got a side order of fried chicken. It's small pieces of crispy fried chicken thighs. I paid a little over $10.00 for all of it. In fact, everything at Oh Curry was very reasonable. I look forward to trying other things at the restaurant. I hope that they make  it."}
{"text":"The only authentic curry shop I go to. The owner, Hide, is always here and he's always thinking about his customers. The good vibes from this restaurant definitely reflects onto the food they make because every time I order their food, I end up smiling and dancing with every bite haha. I'm here at least once a week, so I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to try authentic curry!"}
{"text":"Oh Curry is in a great location near the Downtown Las Vegas area.  The owner has been kind and welcoming on every visit, so this is now my go-to spot for Japanese curry."}
{"text":"Very good curry! The owner is extremely nice and welcoming!   The curry isn't too salty (which some curries can be) and very good portion! Especially if you're hungry!   The place is really cute aswell! Decorated with anime posters!"}
{"text":"this place has exceptional service and food, if I could eat here for everyday in my life I would, best curry spot in Vegas if you ask me, it's truly a gem.   Oh Curry? More like... Oh Heck Yea! (mom said I can't use profanities on the internet)"}
{"text":"I found this hole in the wall through yelp so it only seems fair I help pave the way for others. This place totally lives up to the hype. The service is supreme. They're great at helping you figure out what you might like if it's your first time with Japanese curry (my first with any form of curry). If you're dining in they bring it to your table and clean it themselves but not a waitress situation, similar to Panera bread. I try something different every time I go and have yet to try something I didn't like. Easy on the \"hot curry\" it's a slow heat that builds and will hit you half way through the meal. I would recommend this place to anyone. Great value."}
{"text":"First time having curry i didn't know what to expect but i loved it. Service was great and food was fantastic, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very delicious and worth giving a try over and over again. The employees there are so wonderful. I always stop in on payday just to spoil myself with their delicious curry. Chicken cutlet or the combo is to die for."}
{"text":"This is better and cheaper than Zen curry. I always come here even know I leave far from it"}
{"text":"A must try if you never had Japanese curry before! This place is set up for mostly take outs but they have a few tables inside if you decided to dine in. The restaurant is clean and there are some nice art work along the walls.   The food. I ordered the tonkatsu curry with corn and spice level at hot. The curry and the pork is delicious, careful as you get it because it is really hot (temperature wise) I ended up added more chili powder onto the curry since I like my meals spicy! The tonkatsu was fried with a good amount of crisp and it there was a good amount of pork.   The service here was fast and the employees are very kind. If you're a budget eater, the meal is fairly priced for the amount you get! I'll definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I haven't had good Japanese Curry since I was back home in Hawai'i. Oh! Curry was a decent experience. We had the vegetable curry & the pork cutlet curry (hot) & it was pretty good. Service was good, yet we were the only ones in there. My boyfriend hasn't had Japanese curry so he enjoyed himself as first-timer. Menu is very small & prices are cheap. We also ordered fries that were just alright. Definitely a recommendation for anyone on the Eastside who is looking for something other than fast food or Mexican. I'll still go back."}
{"text":"What?!?! A really tasty Asian restaurant on da east side... I am really critical when it comes to asian food, but this place is really good. Da concept of just curry with da choice of different types of meat is soooo smart. With that being said, the Japanese curry is tasty and you can be in charge of how spicy you want it. I got the tonkatsu/chicken cutlet combo medium heat. Half way through this delicious meal, I spiced it up a bit by adding da spicy powder. Yummy, a whole new taste half way through da same meal. The service here is off da charts. Right away he asked us if this was our first time. He went through da whole menu and took his time explaining everything. 2 thumbs up on service and cleanliness of da restaurant. This place is a must try. Only suggestion is a side of mac salad to top off da great taste experience. Come to da east side and try this great curry house. Aloha"}
{"text":"The food was exactly as stated. Fresh. White sticky rice and curry sauce with a chicken cutlet. The flavor was good. The only thing that I would complain about is that they don't include a vegi. I ordered the chicken cutlet meal it came to $8.10 which is pricey for a chicken cutlet and done steamed rice. A 10 lb bag of rice is 10$! Good food tho I'd just say it was pricey."}
{"text":"I lived in Japan so I know good Japanese Curry when I eat it. This place is owned by a really nice Japanese guy that brightens the place up. I love coming to eat great food and practice my Japanese while I order. They even have the weird Japanese drinks you cant find in the US"}
{"text":"We didn't actually eat in the establishment so I can't do a review for the location itself, but the food was a lot better than I expected. Even my daughter who is quite picky absolutely loved it. Definitely will be repeat customers."}
{"text":"So today me and my husband went out to eat there and ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl. Then I happen to look over my shoulder and seen a Cockroach\"  plus it was flys everywhere!!  never again will I return. Just messed up my stomach smh"}
{"text":"Was not impressed and I love curry! The staff member we dealt with was rude and I didn't like my food and she refused to take it off my bill."}
{"text":"This is one the East sides hidden gems. The Japanese Curry is delicious. Try the \"Combo\" with crispy pork and chicken cutlets served on dark and delicious Japanese Curry and a hearty side of white rice. The staff is friendly, the dining room and well as the bathroom is very clean. A major plus to the newcomer is the owner \"Hide\" is always there, so you can get any questions about the menu answered correctly. Food is served quickly and hot. The staff is really friendly, and prices are very competitive to those of fast food  joints. Worth every penny!  Thank you for the great food and prices.       LpF"}
{"text":"I love this place because it's close to my house, its yummy, and free additional rice! The owner is super nice as well!"}
{"text":"I've never had Curry before but saw a friend eating it and i decided to give it a try. I absolutely love this place and the curry. I eat there atleast once a week. The staff is friendly and i enjoy stopping in. I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is what it is, a curry place. The other reviews about them closing early are true. I called around 7 to ask if they close at 8:30. They said yes, then called me back to let me know the dining room would close at 8pm....odd way of doing business since that was enough time since we live farrrrr. Anywho we ventured another day there and it was ok. Cutlets (had pork) were good and the curry was ok, the spicy was better of the spicy and the regular. The stand out was the potato croquet, creamy and a bit sweet. Also the UCC coffee was quite pleasant. Overall a decent place, friendly staff but nothing worth driving 30 mins for."}
{"text":"The curry was rich and delicious (though the hot could have been spicier) and the chicken catsu I had was very tasty. The gentleman who runs the joint is also very friendly.   Overall, a good place for an affordable lunch on the east side."}
{"text":"Well this place is a hidden gem, awesome and D Lish!! That salad dressing is the bomb, but the Curry is bomb bay and everything is delicious!! Boy it hit the spot!! Can wait for the next visit, which will be soon! Enjoy and check it out!!"}
{"text":"What can I say except that this place ROCKS.  A diamond in the rough if you will.  Kind of located in a dive-ish area, but don't let that turn you off!! This is the best curry chicken I've tasted!!! And the rice is not soggy!!  Love love love this place.  Everything is perfect."}
{"text":"So excited to find this place near me. Super nice people and the food was delicious and so reasonably priced!! The perfect comfort food! I will be back alot!!! Oh and the bonus are the very tasty croquettes!"}
{"text":"Great curry! I ordered the tonkotsu curry with cheese and asked for it hot--definitely did not disappoint. Portion size was definitely more than enough for me, and the owner even let us know if we wanted more rice, haha. Ate everything down to the little pickled radish garnish! Overall a great experience with a sweet owner and some awesome Japanese comfort food (is it considered comfort food? Hmm. But it definitely comforted me!)."}
{"text":"I love Japanese curry but have only ever had from a box so when I learned about This shop I wanted to try it but never found the time until a recent shopping trip. You go in the heavenly aroma of curry can be found. Just from the smell of the restaurant alone I knew this would be good. I ordered a chicken cutlet curry, a drink and an orange jello for dessert. Very affordable and very nice portion size. I left full for sure. The chicken was crispy and not greasy at all, rice was perfect and the curry was amazing. I ordered the regular/medium curry and plan to give the hot a shot next time and there will be a next time. Many next times. The orange jello was jello with some whipped cream on top. Nothing fancy but a nice way to end the meal.   They give you a stamp card so every 8 dishes you buy you get 1 free and unlike some places you get free refills. If you se in the neighborhood definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Wanna try something out of the norm?? This is it! Japanese curry --in my barrio. They have the menu in Spanish too! Owner operated---Hide is a fantastic host!"}
{"text":"I have become a great fan of this joint, I had not had this style of curry in the past and stopped by to see what it was all about. OH CURRY! this was delicious and now so frequent the place almost 3 times a month if I eat out. They have some good variety, my favorite is the combo chicken and tonkatsu with regular spicy curry. You can add cheese to it if you'd Like, but I like it regular and maybe with a side of tofu. Also, If you haven't tried the croquette before, give it a shot, it is interestingly delicious. Great meat substitute. The Calpico drink is very refreshing and compliment the meal very well. The gentleman there is always so nice and makes ordering easy, you can phone your order ahead and have it ready for pick up so you can enjoy at home. He will explain to you about the curry getting a bit thick and how to prepare it of you will have a long drive home. Overall worth a check out if you are on the East side of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"So I'm visiting my sister in Las Vegas from Minnesota for the week, and she introduced me to Oh! Curry.  Now, I'm a picky eater and was hesitant of even going yet I decided to go. Lo and behold, I tried the chicken cutlet curry, and my life has changed. As soon as I get home, I'm going to be looking for a japanese curry place!"}
{"text":"The curry here is exactly what I've been searching for after my other favorite curry place (Kaba Curry) closed down. The place smelled great, like a curry spot for sure. There was a lot of seating available and more customers walked in soon after we did. My friend ordered the chicken katsu meal (HOT) fries and potato croquette. I ordered fried chicken with fries and extra cheese (MILD) curry. The chicken was juicy and the curry was hot in temp. What I liked about this curry in particular is that it didn't have carrot chunks that other curry I've tried had. Needless to say the food was delicious and the portions were excellent for the price. The food came out quickly and they didn't miss a beat. The staff was very friendly and I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I lived in Japan for a couple of years and have been missing authentic Japanese curry! The wonderful tonkatsu curry here brought back great memories. I will definitely be here every time I visit Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at this inconspicuous shopping center on the east side. The entry foyer and dining room looked very modern and nice. The menu is simple and reasonably priced. I got the Tonkatsu curry and Chicken katsu curry both with cheese, fries, and a drink for under $20. The curry is more like a gravy and perfectly executed the Japanese curry style. Definitely a must visit and a refreshing burst of dining diversity in east Las Vegas"}
{"text":"So Mr. Heide came out from Toyko to spread the Word of Curry throughout the Vegas Valley, and the word is good. Typical curry dishes are available sans beef, such as grilled chicken, Chicken Katsu, and Pork Katsu. The time to make is relatively quick and Coffee or Mango Jelly Desserts are available for a quick sugar fix. Oh Curry is a great stop for quick lunch, especially during rushed hours when time is not on your side. Finally, mild is mild and Hot is Medium so do not expect a heat suppose. With that said the curry holds a great spicy flavor without the heat.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So nice to have a Japanese-Style curry place on the east side of town! They have about 5 different styles of curry here including a plain one and I opted for the chicken version. You can get the chicken either fried or grilled/lightly pan fried and I opted for the latter. The meal took about 20 minutes and was a bit of a long wait as the waitress said she got the orders mixed up and had to redo them. They did give us a free dessert to apologize for the wait and I thought that was a nice gesture. The curry itself isn't really comparable to some of the curry joints in town, but it is a nice quick drive when I want my Japanese curry fixed. I just wished they had some pickled stuff to go on my curry like the other restaurants in town.  Service is nice and prices are pretty good on the pocket. I'll be back when I'm craving and don't want to drive to China town. Hopefully they get more menu items and condiments to match in order to up the east side curry game and keep me really coming back for me.. we'll see!"}
{"text":"I'm an oh! Curry regular, it's my go to place for lunch and dinner! I always get a chicken cutlet meal, with a potato cake- can't go wrong. The owner is the sweetest guy ever. I love this local business."}
{"text":"Awesome food, good prices. The owner gives very good customer service! I enjoy the pork cutlet with hot curry! It's now a regular visit for me!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I haven't had curry like this since I was in Osaka. The Katsu and croquettes are perfectly breaded and fried. Curry is spicy and thick and savory."}
{"text":"First, I had never had Japanese Curry before.  I never want to give a bad review to a new restaurant.  I want everyone to succeed and prosper.  I had never eaten curry before and did not know what to expect.  The place was clean, spacious and the person that took my order was friendly.  The large picture of dishes on the wall were about as unappetizing as I had ever seen.  The only colors were brown sauce with white rice with a few \"lumps\" under the sauce.  No Color whatsoever, but I thought it might  be an advertising mistake that the owner just had to deal with.  I ordered Curry with pork and what came out was 1/2 a plate of white rice on one side,  with the ugliest brown sauce  covering the other half and a fried pork patty (sliced into about 8 slices)  laying on top.  My dish had no vegetables to give it color and It was one of the most unappetizing dishes that has ever been served to me.  If you look at the pictures posted, you will see the plates with brown sauce and white rice that  I'm talking about.   If this was a typical dish of Japanese Curry, it is not for me.   I wish this place well and would suggest you try it for yourself as my tastes and preferences may not be the same as others.  It is hidden and only viewable from Stewart directly across the street from CiCi's Pizza.  (You  have to be going east on Stewart and turn into a small strip mall, just before you come to Nellis, to access Oh Curry)"}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese curry place, the owner is super nice, and awesome. The food is delicious no matter what you order. I highly recommend them to everyone!"}
{"text":"The curry is pretty flavorful. The portions are a good size and none of the items are over $7. They have so many item to choose from. My favorite is the chicken Katsu and the French fries. I prefer the mild sauce a little better than the regular. It gives it a little more of a kick and flavor. The place is very chill and they play music from Animes. The beef curry is discontinued.   The service is amazing. The owner is super sweet he repeats your order to make sure it is correct."}
{"text":"One of the few curry places on the east side, especially this far away from China Town, and this only adds to my love for it because it's so close to my home. The curry itself is authentic japanese curry with its own recipe I haven't really tasted elsewhere- what sets it aside in the most obvious sense is the thickness of it. In this sense it sticks out for better or worse among other curries around town but honestly, I love it. The spice levels all are distinguishable even with the texture. The owner, Hide, is such a sweet caring man and you can probably find him working when you go and will go out of his way to make sure you are happy because he cares deeply about his restaurant :) also he gives free rice if you finish it all and I appreciate that! My recommendation is the chicken cutlet curry with any spice level tbh. Even though it's close to my home I would go out of my way to come here if it were further. I mean I come here like every week along with my best friend since it's also really affordable and we're always broke lol. Much appreciation to Hide and his amazing curry!"}
{"text":"Great place to get curry on the east side of town. Katherine O. was right, this is a diamond in the rough considering it's mainly taquerias and mainstream fast food joints in the area. So I've been wanting to try them since I was assigned to work a location in this area for 3 months. My 3 months was over so I finally decided to have lunch here on my last day. I called ahead of time so it would be ready by the time I got there. When I arrived I still had to wait a minute or two which was fine with me. When it was ready it was in a to-go container and the cashier/expediter explained that the curry sauce gets thick and to add a little bit water after an hour. However, little did she know I was going to eat it right then and there. I had the combination which is half tonkatsu and chicken katsu. The texture was great and I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the pork or chicken, so I would get the chicken since it's supposed to be better for you anyway vs. pork. I had the mild curry because I am weak sauce, but it was a good almost thick consistency. I absolutely love it on the rice more so than the chicken/pork because the breading gets a tad bit soggy. I tried the radish on the side, which is a nice crunch but I didn't really taste anything. The inside of this place is very clean and the menu is pretty big with pictures. On the side of the menu there's a explanation of what curry is in Japan, the funny part is there was also a Spanish translation- that's how you know you're on the east side is when there's a Spanish translation even for something Asian. Overall great experience, I probably won't be back because I am never on the side of town, but for all you curry lovers who live here you won't have to travel all the way to China town anymore for your curry fix."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken & Tonkatsu special, and it was quite satisfactory. Curry (I chose Hot) was tasty and the meat had good texture, though maybe a tad too crispy, just a tad. Location and overall environment bring down the rating, but otherwise it's a pretty solid choice for lunch.  Shoutout to the weeaboo wall scroll decorations."}
{"text":"I work down the street and was scouring Yelp to find a good lunch option and to my delight, I found this place! I can't exactly comment on the ambiance of the restaurant because I ordered my food to go through Eat24 so I just came in and out. From what I saw, it looked like the restaurant was pretty big and spacious.   The ordering process on Eat24 was pretty simple and when I arrived, I literally just walked in and out because everything was already ready.   I was going to give it 4 stars because they were going to charge me extra for the pickled radish (and no other curry place in town charges me for it), but the cashier just gave it to me without charge so I am content!   I ordered the pork Katsu and asked for my curry sauce to be hot. I will say that their curry sauce has a different flavor from the curry houses on spring mountain, but regardless, I still really enjoyed the taste. The hotness level was perfect for my liking and the portion was huge for what I was paying."}
{"text":"Amazing curry!  Really enjoy the spiciness level of the regular curry, though my wife prefers the mild.  I'm a big fan of adding vegetables to the meals and the best way to do this price wise is to order the vegetable curry and add a chicken or pork cutlet to it."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had a hampering for some Curry after getting our hair done and boy were we in for a surprise! Oh Curry has a wide open lounge, and the building is very clean and bright. Hide, the man himself, is super friendly! Strikes up conversation with his customers whenever he can and always has a smile on his face  On arrival he walked us through his menu since we were first timers in his humble restaurant. The food rolled out very quickly, and boy was it amazing! The serving is huge, rice is plentiful and the pricing is perfect! I come from a Vietnamese family so the curry I've had is more soup-like. Hide's curry is nicely thick and goes perfectly with the rice and meat cutlets. My fiance added a side of Gyoza to her curry and it was to die for  It didn't seem so...heavy (?) compared to the Gyoza I've had at many dim sum restaurants. The fries and curry dipping sauce make for a great combo! The fries soak up the curry so well and it's great  After our meal we decided to enjoy desert, we ordered an orange dream and it was delicious, pretty much a creamsicle. Hide was very generous and gave us a coffee twist with the orange dream. Everything just made for an amazing dine in experience.  Hide's made a customer for life and he'll be seeing the two of us very often!"}
{"text":"Probably the best curry spot in the East! Great service, the staff was very friendly, Prices are good and the food is excellent. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"One of the best curry spots in town and the best bang for your buck. Each plate comes with a lot of meat. The actual curry is excellent and authentic. I only wish they were open a little later for late night curry."}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for 8 years and this curry took me back to those good ol' days. I tried the Tonkatsu Curry and their salad with sesame sauce. Yum!!! I think their prices are too low. It was a huge portion for $6.99."}
{"text":"Super unique  food love  that i can easily  choose something  if you love curry this place will hook you up plus there is a frequent customer card  after so many purchases you get one free.. great curry sauce i always get the vegetable curry with medium  curry sauce and a side of chicken grilled... yummo"}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's favorite place for sure! The food is delicious and reminds us of our honeymoon in Japan while being very reasonably priced. The gentleman who takes our order (the owner?) is super kind and answers any questions we have without being pushy for a sale. Honestly we've gotten food delivered from here a ton of times but we'll be going inside a lot more often just because of how kind and friendly he was! Also, the little deserts aren't as little as they appear in the pics. The coffee and orange jellies are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Great family business! Great food! Fast lunch!  My lunch spot anytime on on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought there was value in putting a Japanese curry restaurant in the East side of town but there is!  Oh Curry is off Stewart and Nellis, that's pretty damn east of Vegas and it works out great!    I love the simplicity from the short menu to the plain look of the interior.  They don't try to do more than serve Japanese curry and overfill the inside with posters and such.    I keep it simple with just the tonkatsu and medium curry.  If you're ever on the east side, don't be shy to try it."}
{"text":"Finally an Asian spot on the east side! It's hard to compete with china town but I was pleasantly surprised.   After my first visit today is definitely go back. The price is right, the food quality was good, and the place was clean with a nice staff.  You basically pick a meat to go with your curry sauce and rice.  I'm accustomed to eating Japanese curry at home. It's simple and cheap to make. I'd definitely say I know a thing or two about food curry.  They have beef, grilled or fried chicken, veggie, or plain.   Comes with the meat and comes with white rice and the sauce. You can order sides also.  I believe they all come with the same sauce which has a bit of a spice to it.  First of all the counter girl was awesome. She asked if I was a first timer and also checked with the kitchen for wait times on the orders. I thought that was really cool of her.    Anyways my order was Tonkatsu pork to go.  The girl have me instructions on reheating which I thought was awesome.  The amount of sauce they gave me seemed excessive but when I ate it all with the rice is say it was a food amount. It was served with some pickled ginger on top which was nice.  The sauce itself was good. It had a lot of heat. The heat might even have been a bit much IMO. I would have liked it to have more depth of flavor and less heat but it was still good.  The rice they used was really good. I'd say it is about 1.5-2 cups of white rice.   The Tonkatsu was perfectly fried and juicy. I'd say it was lacking in the flavor department. It could have used some salt. Again the lightly breaded pork was fried perfectly. Also this isn't pounded like Hawaiian Katsu chicken.  Overall I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Play by play of the restaurant here at Stewart and nellis for oh! Curry.  The person taking our order was very pleasant and cordial. Though, she really doesn't know much about japanese curry, her hospitality and customer service makes up for it.  Ordering the curry, there's only 3 choices for the curry sauce. Regular, mild, and hot. Reminds me of S&B golden curry powder/blocks. Which in turn, makes me think that their curry sauce aren't homemade recipe unlike cocos ichibanya, or the local contenders, zen curry or kaba curry. But even if that's the case, the curry sauce was pretty good. I opted for hot only because I know the mild is almost like the regular...she let me taste the difference. I would have preferred it between mild and hot, but since that's not a choice, I have to go for hot. The scale for the choices of what they have would be regular (no spice which is 0 on the scale), mild (little spice which would have been a 2 on the scale), and hot (lots of spice which would be a 8.5 on a scale of 1 - 10). I prefer my curry to be right around 5, which would be a medium, so it's spicy but I can still taste the base stock of the curry.  As for the chicken cutlet curry that I ordered, it was nice and good. It was cooked just right. Not too dry but the breading is still nice and crispy.   Being a newly opened restaurant, relatively, they are doing a card promotion where if you have visited and ordered a curry meal, the tenth meal is free. This would drive some word of mouth, but if they want to have more presence, they need to actively promote the place.   The only reasons I'm giving oh! Curry a four star are these:  -Location. I wouldn't have known this place existed if I didn't use the walmart pass through way to get to Stewart...I really don't go to that specific walmart for obvious reasons. -Menu. They don't have a full japanese curry restaurant menu.  -Curry sauce options. There's only three choices which I have covered; regular, mild, and hot. Reminds me of S&B golden curry...which I do cook myself...but instead I use panku breading.  Other than that, this place is a great alternative if you want japanese curry when you're in the east side of town and don't feel like driving all the way to spring mountain for Zen Curry or Kaba Curry...or all the way to California for Coco's Ichibanya."}
{"text":"Very friendly. Asked if it was my first time and then begin explaining the menu to me. Felt very welcomed. I had the vegetable curry as I am trying to cut out meat. It was excellent. The regular curry was spicy enough to give it a kick, but not overwhelming with a spice. Just right. I'll definitely be back. Less than $8 for a meal and a drink and I am full! My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 100 stars but 5 will do for now.  I had the tonkatsu curry and it was the most delicious curry plate ive ever had. It may look like basic food, but the flavors are what makes this the best thing ever.  Also the workers there are super nice and gave me a stamp card along with a pamphlet that lets you know what deals they have. For example: 2 for 1 Tuesdays.  I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese curry on the east side of Vegas, and the owner is very friendly. The chicken katsu and udon noodle soup is awesome."}
{"text":"Really like this, the curry was very good there is three levels of heat too and I really enjoyed my green tea icecream. Very creamy and rich, the girl working there was friendly. Wasn't too busy when we came in but did order two curry dishes with ice cream can of green tea and can of coffee. Coming back for more soon"}
{"text":"After a really good experience at Japanese Curry Zen, I decided to give this place another try.  My preference is still curry that has everything except the rice cooked together, but there's nothing wrong with plain curry, rice, and toppings. The curry is flavorful, their tonkatsu is nice, and they give you a good amount of meat when you order chicken."}
{"text":"Yay! I finally have a place to get a delicious bowl of Japanese curry udon. The udon noodles were cooked perfectly,  nice & chewy. The curry Is thick and compliments the noodles well. So good! My daughter had the veggie curry and my mom had the tonkatsu & chicken katsu combo curry. They both enjoyed it! The cashier was nice & personable. The owner also came out to talk to us, such a nice guy, you can tell he enjoys what he does and takes pride in his cooking. Restaurant is clean. Portions are generous and prices are very affordable. Oh! Curry is definetely a new favorite. Check them out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"A real gem in the east part of Las Vegas. We usually dont get restaurants that specialize in different types of foods other than the usual American or Mexican eateries. So to have a restaurant like Oh Curry to debut in the local area is an amazing relief to the monotony than many of us endure.     The food is amazing and sold at reasonable prices. I suggest going with the standard tonkatsu curry and venturing out from there. I guarantee you'll love it at your first bite!"}
{"text":"Said I would upgrade my rating when they added some things, and they now have potato croquettes.   Still the best katsu curry in town, bar none."}
{"text":"Just in town for a few weeks and saw the yelp recommendation. The food doesn't disappoint! If you've love Cocos Ichiban Curry then you'll definitely want to try this place. The owner is friendly and the restaurant is very clean. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service was wonderful and the food was sooooo yummy. The best I've had since I left Hawaii. I will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"If you've ever found yourself on the east side of Vegas, you'd find that aside from tacos, good eats are sparse and hard to find. When Oh! Curry opened up, I welcomed it with open arms. Finally, a local mom and pop spot bringing some Japanese flavor to the Sunrise Mountain community.  Oh! Curry has a simple menu. You get your curry normal, mild, or hot. Then you choose what you want with your curry (grilled or katsu choices). Definitely hits the spot on a cold winter day. I wouldn't say that it's the best Japanese curry in the city (Curry Zen remains my fav), but it's definitely some good radius eating if you're in the area.  It's good simple Japanese comfort food. I ain't mad at that. It's good enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service been coming here a year  and things haven't changed i love it!!"}
{"text":"There isn't anything bad I can say about our experience. The flavor of the food, especially the curry itself, was amazing. The portions are huge, we all had food leftover to bring home, and the service was great! We met the owner, he was so kind and you could tell the restaurant is his pride and joy. I would highly recommend going here for some Japanese comfort food!"}
{"text":"It's still a pretty new establishment but the staff is always very friendly and the food is always perfect. Just recently tried the orange jello for dessert (there's a free coupon on the menu) and it was surprisingly good! Would recommend to anyone who wants to get full and eat good food for under $10!"}
{"text":"Just went for Lunch and loved it. The staff were very helpful and nice.  I got the chicken cutlet (Extra Hot), and was very fulfilling. I recommend this place if you are a curry lover."}
{"text":"First impressions really make a difference.  From the moment we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly lady.  Simple Japanese curry dishes that pack a lot of flavor.  I had the hot tonkatsu curry and it was great!  We also ordered grilled chicken curry and red bean ice cream as well. Again very good. The owner was the chef and was very thankful for our business and I can say we will no doubt be regulars.  Thank you Hide for Oh Curry!!!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to find an authentic curry spot on the east side. Parking was a breeze. They have a frequent diner card where you can earn punches to an eventual free meal. Also, their to go menu has a couple of coupons to use on future visits.   Food - I ordered the chicken cutlet and added veggies, which is a sautéed mix of red peppers, zucchini and yellow squash. I ordered it medium spicy, which wasn't spicy imho, but, a few shakes of dry spice and the heat was perfect. The chicken cutlet was fried perfectly. I'm not a curry expert, but I loved the flavor  Service - I happened to catch the owner, Hide, manning the counter and it was spot on. He even gave me a free side of pickles, which was appreciated.   Cleanliness - Super clean! A proudly posted.   Value - This place has yuuuugge portions and is super cheap when compared to other curry spots.   In all.... I'm so happy to have found this place thanks to Yelp and will become a frequent visitor since I work in the area."}
{"text":"I am lowering my rating to 3 stars, from 4 stars, for the following reason:  The restaurant hours sign, on the front window, states the restaurant is open till 8:30pm. Don't believe it.  I drove 3 miles, out of my way to eat, on a Wednesday evening; I arrived at 7:44 pm. As I entered the restaurant, the owner told me he was closed.  This was 45 min before his posted closing time.  Before leaving the parking lot I rechecked his business hours. 8:30pm.   After driving out~of-my-way, for nothing, I decided to go to Jack-in-the-Box instead... saved about 7 dollars.  The moral of this story don't think this restaurant is going to stay open till their posted hours.   Go somewhere else if it's around 7:30pm. Save yourself the aggravation of a closed restaurant.  This restaurant now has 1 strike against it; Hopefully they don't strike out in the future."}
{"text":"Japanese Curry on the east side?!  If you live or ever been in the area, you know that there are only fast food joints and taquerias around.  It's nice to have something different.    I was super excited when it first opened!  I ordered katsu curry to go and the owner is really nice!  He explained how to reheat the curry so I have the same consistency at home (fyi, you add a little bit of water and heat it up in the microwave.)    You can get your curry in either, mild, medium, or hot.  My second time trying it, I bought one of each and found hot to be the most flavorful, without being nose dripping spicy.  I saw some chili powder near the counter, so you could add some more heat while dining in.  They now have pickled radish!  It adds a nice texture and taste to the curry.     The curry is comparable to the ones in Chinatown, considering where it's located.  Out of the four curry spots I've had in Vegas, this place ranks second in my book.  Which is pretty good!  Support the nice man's business instead of going to McDonalds."}
{"text":"The curry here is the best in town! Other places are overpriced and give very small servings. I live across town and I drive across town for some delicious Oh Curry. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get. The owner is also very nice and has given me and my friends free pudding on a few occasions. I came in with my parents today and we loved it! The girl who took our order and brought it was very nice! We will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I found out about this place when my supervisor mentioned it and said that it sounded like something my friend and I would like. And it was. When we walked in it smelt like curry, and the guy behind the counter seemed really busy. After a few minutes he told us it would be about 20 minutes before we get our food cuz he was sending out last minute online orders. We had the time so we waited and eventually got our food (chicken cutlets- regular and tonkatsu-mild). The portion was on the big side, half the plate was rice and lots of curry. The flavor was great, the manager (at least I think he was) was very polite and at one point asked us if we've had Japanese curry before and showed us how to eat it. Over all I would definitely go back and bring/drag my mom with me."}
{"text":"Ever since my last few visits, the curry just keeps getting better and better! The flavors are a lot better too. I also have the option of receiving extra ginger and extra free rice, so this place gets a 5 star from me. I filled up my card and I'm gonna get my free curry the next time I go. I love it so much here! I'll never get tired of the flavor."}
{"text":"Really great place to eat, the cashier was cool and funny! Will return here for sure!"}
{"text":"This curry place is amazing! I am NOT a fan of take out, because take out food is never the same as dining in.  My friend ordered the Chicken Cutlet Curry with the sauce on the side.  I was REALLY impressed with the dish.  The chicken cutlet was cut to the perfect thickness and was still very juicy for deep fried.  The batter used was light, NOT greasy and surprisingly still CRISPY (after a 20 minute car ride in a Styrofoam plate).  The curry was phenomenal.  I would say it was flavorful and not overwhelmed with spices (like Indian curry).  Great food! Low Price! Perfect Portion!  I would have to say that this is my NEW favorite Japanese curry house!"}
{"text":"If you love Japanese curry.. or have never tried it.. go here! I've been here many times over the years to get my curry fix. Hide, the owner, is great! They've added onto the menu with some good choices! I always get the veggie curry with chicken katsu (topping). My gf got the curry udon which was really good! (A bit different curry than the normal)fyi. Food is always hot, fresh and delicious! The prices are great! Go check it out! Quick and simple home style Japanese!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my favorite spots to hit when I'm in the mood for some Japanese curry. Hide is a prime example of what how every restaurant owner should be. He's extremely friendly and remembers my friends and I whenever we go in. The hospitality of being at this establish is all due to his part in being a very welcoming owner. The combination curry is my go to whenever I order here. Just be careful not to overdo it with the spicy powder because it is REALLY spicy, but if that's what you're wanting then go crazy with it!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!  I love \"Oh! Curry\".  We get it when ever we can!  The \"hot\" curry has a nice bite at the end, but not over the top.   The crochet is awesome!!  It's like mashed potatoes covered in panko and deep fried.   It's soft and crispy at the same time."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Japanese curry, but overall I was pleased. I got the chicken cutlet with the spicy curry to go, which means the curry comes on the side and I got to pour it to my liking instead of having food swimming in the sauce. At first I didn't think the curry was very spicy, but maybe about halfway through eating i realized a few tears rolling down from the spice.   i was unaware you could add vegetables to your curry platter, but i would like to try that! there's not much seating in the store, and the cashier seemed like she would rather be six feet under than at work, but its good for cheap fast food"}
{"text":"\"Oh! Curry\" stood out to me compared to other restaurants in Vegas, not only is it the only of its kind in this area but I've never even heard of Japanese curry until the first day that my boyfriend and I walked in to give it a try. I've tried Thai and Indian curry before, but to be honest I didn't like it so much so of course I was skeptical at first.      Believe me when I tell you, I wish I have heard of Japanese curry before because it's absolutely delicious, flavorful, and satisfying; in my eyes it's the perfect comfort food. Not only is the food amazing, so is the service, cleanliness, and the overall quality of the restaurant. I always feel welcomed when I walk in and leave with a satisfied tummy and a smile on my face. The food is authentic Japanese food and I feel like im in a small part of Japan when I eat there, and I can't go a week without eating there because its so good!      I've also found that on their facebook page they're ALWAYS doing facebook promotions so you can get a discount off of your meal, this is amazing considering how inexpensive it is to dine here in the first place. Oh, and you also get all you can eat rice if you're dining in, all you have to do is ask! I definitely recommend for anyone to go here if you haven't already, I PROMISE you wont disappointed."}
{"text":"This is by far the best curry I've had in a really long time. Not to mention the staff is extremely sweet making the whole experience even better. Oh! Curry is close to my house unlike many other japanese cuisine restaurants that happen to be somewhere near China Town. Great authentic japanese food thanks to Hide!"}
{"text":"Love this little curry spot on the east side!  Service is outstanding and plus you get to meet the owner how cool is that! His name is Hide and he's not afraid to come out and meet you and when he does don't be afraid to tell him how good the curry is he'll appreciate that. We go the chicken cutlet and the veggie plates and the curry makes you feel straight out of the country side of Japan let me tell you  anyhow if your in the area stop by you won't regret it adagietto!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! First time here and the customer service was fantastic. Explained the menu and made me feel very comfortable. The chicken cutlet curry dish was so good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Oh curry's chicken Katsu compares favorably with zen curry at a slightly lesser price. The staff are warm and friendly and more than happy to chat with you. Gourmet food at fast food prices is hard to beat... I couldn't recommend it more."}
{"text":"Everyone is very friendly. If you've never been there before, they will give you free samples and I also got a coupon book to come back and eat there again.  I highly recommend this place. The food is inexpensive and you get a large portion. Very good first experience."}
{"text":"Awesome place! My husband and I really wanted curry and I remembered passing by this place all of the time. I'm so glad we decided to give this place a try. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. The owner also explained to us the menu and made sure we were enjoying our meal. DEFINITELY GET THE GREEN TEA ICE CREAM. My husband tried the coffee dessert and it was different but very good! We will without a doubt eat here again!"}
{"text":"Food is inexpsensive for massive portions of made to order food. Owner works the front counter quite often and has superb customer service. Food quality exceeds what they are charging for it. Tried almost everything here and nothing disappoints. I hate using yelp with a passion but this restaurant deserves a review worthy of its quality."}
{"text":"I have tried other curry places, but I like this one the best because is not as thick as other places is just the perfect texture. My favorite meal is the chicken cutlet, when you bite in to it the outside is crispy and the inside is really tender and juice. I usually get it hot but regular is also very tasty. My favorite side orders are the croquette and the salad they are so yummy a definite must try!!! Also the calpico Japanese drink is different but you will definitely love it. Affordable and delicious place to eat with family and friends :)"}
{"text":"So I have decided to give this place another try! And I must say Im happy I did! I ordered tonkatsu with mild curry and the pork is really tender this time! Yummm!"}
{"text":"I'm from California and I came by with my family to check this place out, the owner is super kind and welcoming. I got the chicken cutlet meal in hot and it was delicious, would definitely come here again when I visit Las Vegas again! (:"}
{"text":"I love Japanese curry not too fond of the other stuff. I ordered the chicken/pork option. The meat was fried crisp and came out fresh and hot. While it was decent, it was not as flavorful as expected. The service was quick and polite. I would go back if I had a craving but not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The chicken cutlet curry is so delicious. I got reg spicy and it was spot on, just the right amount of spicy kick. The prices are great, the portion was huge. The service is absolutely amazing. As soon as you walk in you are welcomed and helped. The food came out so fresh and hot. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the visit. Two days ago I went to Zen curry and was turned off to curry but came to oh currys because my friend insisted it was better. Well she was right, I'm now a believer in Japanese curry and will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I am not from local and traveling here. I found  this hidden gem place on Yelp. The plate is so big and this is the best curry I have had. I am a San franciscan can not believe this price can get such of this great meal. I am sure I will come back again if I have chance to travel LV again."}
{"text":"I was craving curry and I always drive by this place so I finally decided to go in! The girl behind the counter was so friendly! She helped me decide what to order so I got the chicken curry and wow I didn't expect it to be so good! I'm glad I tried this place of course I wish I got more chicken with my order but it was a good portion for the price! I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"Amazon curry! The best one I have ever tried in America. I suggest try the beef and fried chicken curry."}
{"text":"On Point! When I lived in Shanghai Curry Houses were an everyday thing. No so much here in Vegas. In fact I think this is the only one. Authentic recipes, laidback atmosphere, friendly staff, the portions are  generous. This is one the other side of town for me, but it's definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great Japanese curry shop in the area. Workers are very friendly and owner always come out  to greet you. I Love Love Love the Chicken Cutlet Curry with Hot curry sauce. I would love to try the Beef Curry but it seem like it's never available and maybe need to be taken off the menu."}
{"text":"Great Japanese curry house!! Very authentic, I got the \"hot\" but needed to add more chili powder! Other than that the prices were great and the staff was very sweet (the cute blonde girl at the register) we will definitely be back next time we are on this side of town! Only thing I wish they had was more topping selection  other than that it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The quality of the food was great. I couldn't believe how cheap it was and The portions are huge. I've tried other curry restaurants and this one is at the top of the list. The staff was very friendly and the inside of the place was very clean. I Totally recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I had never had Japanese curry before. My dad has been here multiple times and really enjoyed it. So since we are on vacation here this is where we ended up.  Very good.  Out of the 8 of us everyone gave it a 5 star! We ordered the Tonkatsu and the Chicken curry. Plus the salad that has a toasted sesame dressing it is to die for. Everything is fresh and good. We definitely will come back again before leaving town!  The owner Hide is very nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Love the curry here. Place is always clean. The owner is very nice. The coffee twist is delicious make sure you order it. You get to pick your spicy level. I always get mild and my husband gets medium and they are both delicious. The udon noodles are great and so is the chicken cutlets. Don't forget the side of pickle."}
{"text":"The owners are so nice that I hesitated to write the review. The curry here is just ok. I was spoiled by the delicious curry at you know where (rhymes with Ben) that this place was a disappointment. Sorry, I really wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go if you are hankering for Japanese Curry and don't want to schlep to Chinatown.    The place is spartan and clean.  There are English and Spanish flyers and posters everywhere educating you on what Japanese Curry is about.  Did you know it is a Japanese comfort food?   The tonkatsu curry tasted just as it should.  There was a lot of oniony flavor to the curry.  The meat was fried just right.  I like the fries which you can dip in curry.  If you like over-processed fast food fries, you won't like these fries.  Bonus: Kids meal is free if the kid eats there."}
{"text":"First, I have to mention that the people who work this store are extremely nice and fun to talk to! Out of all the Asian peoples, the Japanese are known to have the greatest customer service--it's true. :)   Oh! Curry is a restaurant that is new and pretty clean, with a large bench of tables that you could hella throw birthday parties in and a pretty straightforward menu! We visited this location because my friend adores Japanese curry and I just love curry in general; and I was not disappointed.   Their curry was extremely cheap and pretty good! (I do wish the regular had more spice though lol) The price is legit; they give you a lot of rice, a lot of curry, and a good amount of meat!! They also have some sides: fried chicken, fries, and tonkatsu. These you can buy separately and dip in curry--YUM!   Also, that jelly dessert is just delicious. I don't even like orange flavored things, but it was great!! And the owner told us that he was adding coffee jelly to the menu and let us taste it--IT WAS BOMB. The man is gonna be known for that coffee jelly, guys. They should really add more jelly flavors to their menu because it's just too good to pass up!   We didn't order a drink, but soda is 1.29 and bottled water is --under a dollar--. Even at gas stations, that can be rare lol.   So, I'm in love with their curry, and I will be trying their hottest curry next time"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional as was the food! I would recommend this place in a second! The flavor of the regular curry was unforgettable! I had not eaten curry before and this will definitely not be the last time."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo yummy and the owner is the nicest guy ever! Literally cannot express how kind Mr. Hide is, he's by far my favorite ever! Every time we come in he chats with us and even gives us free icecream and drinks. It's my brothers favorite place to eat out. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went to Oh Curry! today for a lunch. It was fantastic. They have all the usual curry house options. I had The combo curry plate with added veggies and croquette. It was fantastic. My colleague had the Curry Udon Soup and quite enjoyed it. The only downside to our visit was a couple options on the soda machine were out.  Fantastic Curry House at value price. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am still in disbelief that I found this gem on my side of town! I am sure most east-siders can agree that we lack variety when it comes to Asian restaurants (that are good, anyway).   We ordered with Hide (the owner) and guided us through the menu very politely.  We had a big party and it was late so they had to make more rice which was going to take longer than usual. Hide came over to our table to personally apologized and offered us some free fries and curry while we waited.   The food was brought to our table and Hide told us about the Japanese dish and culture. The food was delicious! I love spicy food so I had the spicy and it was not too crazy spicy. It was just right! My parents and siblings had the regular and they said it still had a very slight kick in terms of spicy.   I recommend the chicken cutlet and add a side of vegetables! Also the green tea or mango ice cream!   Thanks so much Hide and crew, you have gained some regulars!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've had Japanese curry and it did not disappoint! The menu is simple, not a huge offering but they have something for everyone. Chicken cutlet, tonkatsu, veggie, steak, tofu, grilled chicken and pork nuggets (w/ fries) pretty much sums up the menu. Then you have your add-ons (corn, gyoza, cheese, etc) and some other sides, a couple drinks and dessert. I ordered the same thing every time I went: chicken cutlet w/ hot curry, gyoza topping and a UCC green tea.  Perfect lunch/dinner. You should DEFINITELY grab some curry from here if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's very rare that you find good restaurant to eat at in the eastside since majority of them are across town. I ordered the Tonkatsu (Chicken Cutlet) and a side of Fried Chicken. The curry was the best I've had and in my opinion even better than Zen. They also give you a coupon stamp card so after 8 meals, you get a free meal. The best part about this experience was the customer service of the owner \"Hide\". I'll definitely be back for more and next time I'm bringing more friends."}
{"text":"Great place and friendly people. It smells really good coming inside and food is really good"}
{"text":"Someone came in to my boyfriend's job and gave him coupons for a free entree. We went on a Saturday around three o'clock. It was dead, but the girl behind the counter was very nice. When our food arrived, the esthetic of the plate left something to be desired, but omg!!! The food was really amazing! My boyfriend had the chicken cutlet and I had the tonkatsu. It was so delicious; we both loved it.  I've lived right around the corner since before they opened and was always curry curious. It took almost two years and a freebie to get me to go. I was always surprised to see it still open. Nowi know how they have managed to survive in this somewhat cursed location... Simple delicious food.   The only reason I only gave four stars was due to the appearance of the plate. Other than that, it was excellent. We have gone back and taken or friends. It's so much better than any of the surrounding fast food places.   Hurry Hurry to OH CURRY!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating curry, and I have to say that I actually loved it! I had the combo plate with pork cutlet and chicken cutlet and it was fantastic. Best part of the experience was the great customer service I received from the owner and the other employees. I will be definitely coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Japanese curry and I brought some home so my husband could try it too.  We both were pleasantly surprised at how good it was!  I love yellow curry but this was a little different.  The restaurant was clean and the owner was very kind as well as informative about the difference in Japanese curry and Indian or Tia curry.  We will be returning to this restaurant to experience other curry dishes!"}
{"text":"First time ever trying curry, I've always wanted to, but never had the chance, and bam, found Oh Curry. The food is delicious! They had different levels of spiciness for their curry, but I'm a wimp, so I always eat mild (which is not spicy at all).  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The owner, Hide, is also really nice.  One of the biggest things that drew me to the store, besides the curry, were the anime wall scrolls on the front windows. I feel like places like this are hard to find, and they just make me feel at home.   The only problem that I can see is that their fountain machine isn't working 100%, but it's a small detail compared to how great everything else is. :]"}
{"text":"OMG! New menu items include teriyaki bowl, chicken or pork! So light and delicious. Best I have had since living in Japan. Chef Keiko is the Emeril of Japanese cuisine. Moreover Masa and Morimoto! A new Iron chef has emerged on East Stewart. Worth the drive  from any part of town. Better than madness, it's totally teriyaki insanity. Put it on your bucket list! Curry udon is still one of my favorites of all time."}
{"text":"My husband used to live in Japan where he had \"the best curry\". We went to Oh Curry, and he said that it was the closest curry he's eaten in the last 20 years to the one in Japan. He loves it so much that I took him there for his birthday, and he couldn't have been happier. It is very reasonable in price since the two of us cost about $15 total. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for Japanese curry or for anyone who is looking for an uncommon type of food. The owner and staff are also great, and the restaurant itself is very clean!"}
{"text":"I live pretty far from here, but oh man was it worth the drive. Oh! Curry has a pretty \"hole in the wall\" kind of feel to it and overall it really adds to the experience. The portions were quite generous and the curry itself is on point. Oh! Curry has managed to combine the speed of a fast food joint with the comfort and taste of a sit down restaurant. It certainly is a good match.    We were fortunate enough to sit and chat with the owner who was pretty charismatic and overall he was a total people person. All in all with my experience of eating, and the warm welcome presented to us by the owner, I can certainly say I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Eating lunch with SmallOne. This place is refreshing.  I love anime and now I love curry.  Oh how exciting!!!! The customer service was so nice and he was patient with us. Since this is the first time eating Japanese curry,  he explained  the level of spiciness and the food portion size of what should be expected. And on top of that,  now I have someone I can practice my Japanese with. Exciting!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I pick up from here all the time. The chicken is always cooked to perfection and the curry is on point.  LPT - they have a potato croquette that isn't on the menu that is so delicious!  Edit- the potato croquet is on the menu now along with goyza!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Japanese curry I've tasted yet!! No bottle powder canned sauce here. Made from scratch homemade taste. The chicken cutlet and tonkatsu was perfectly seasoned and cooked just right....lightly crispy and moist inside. It may look plain but once you savor the sauce...omg yummy!!"}
{"text":"So good I forgot to take a photo before devouring my entire plate. Ordered the tonkatsu, chicken cutlet, BBQ pork nuggets, Japanese salad, and the kids meal. The curry!! The curry was so flavorful and had just the right amount of spiciness. They also give you a huge serving of the curry so be prepared to eat! I could've just eaten the curry with rice which, by the way, is an option. They will also give you extra rice at no charge so you can soak up all that amazing curry.   The pork nuggets are covered in a sweet and savory Japanese BBQ sauce and are nice and juicy. It's a must order. Seriously. The Japanese salad was a simple salad with lettuce, tomatoes, and corn but the sesame dressing on it was amazing. Wish they sold bottles of it because I would eat a salad everyday...maybe.    The folks behind the counter were super friendly and attentive. Made dining here really pleasant. They also have stamp cards so after 8 stamps you get the 9th free. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came in at 8:30 PM the service was quick.  ordered ordered two combo curries (half tonkatsu and half katsu) and we got a kids meal free and a coffee gelatin dessert. One of the curries was hot and the other one was mild. In my opinion the hot had more flavor to it plus it was spicier. The curry was very aromatic and flavorful altogether and if you live on the east side and want to try Japanese-style curry or just love curry then this is the spot to go to"}
{"text":"Owner is really friendly.  Also, salad is good. For only $2 it is a bargain.  Got chicken cutlet and the chicken was nice and crunchy. Not at all dry. Curry was thick, savory and flavorful. Trust him when he says to add the cheese. :)"}
{"text":"Service is awesome here. Small little place but curry is spot on almost as good as the curryhouses in hawaii and japan. Always order chicken katsu curry with a side of tonkatsu..plus you can ask for more rice if needed. Owner, Hide is a cool guy always talks to the customers when he gets a chance to get out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese curry that I have had since I was in Okinawa Japan. you have to try this place! I had the tonkatsu, and it was perfect. please please please open another restaurant near 215 and North Decatur.!!!"}
{"text":"I have had to think about this, I love curries, but this was my first Japanese version. I had the chicken cutlet version with regular sauce.  I'm still thinking as I'm typing, the sauce itself is an interesting flavor combination, I actually think I will end up buying the sauce by itself and add my own proteins. That is not a put down on Oh Curry, but let's face realities, for $6,99 you get a good sized portion, but it's still only $6,99 at that price point it is excellent value, but my first thought after eating it was this sauce would be great as the base for a shrimp curry, but at $6,99 there is no way they could do it..  Anyways, if you are a curry fan swing over and give it a try, it's worth the drive, the food is good and that's what counts in the end."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. From the music they play to the food this place is overall a 10/10 in my book. On top of that, the owner is super nice, friendly, easy to talk to, and hospitable."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly, asking if I had been in before, if I needed any help with the menu. The owner was the one who helped me, he made sure to give me a stamp card to combine with the one I left at home.   I got the chicken cutlet curry, I asked for it hot. It exceeded my expectations. The first time I had curry from this place, which was about 6 months or so ago, the curry had a meaty, chili taste, but this time it was spot on with how I think Japanese curry should taste.  Food prices are reasonable, comparing to other curry places I have been."}
{"text":"Regular customer here. Prices are good and food is excellent. Owner is very nice and easy to talk to. Can not go wrong for Japanese curry."}
{"text":"A hidden jewel in las vegas, thats what oh! Curry is. Great good, great price and huge portion. Been coming since it opened always happy when i leave"}
{"text":"The service was great , food made fresh we will definitely be back! Thank you for the Japanese soft drinks!!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! This place serves the real JPN curry. And the price is so reasonable.  And it's taste lot better than my cooked curry  per my husband.   If you are familiar with JPN curry you have to try this one.   We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year now and if you live in this area there's definitely nothing like it. I've had the entire menu including sides and desserts. From what I've seen they're always coming up with new stuff and I can't wait to see what they dish out. Keep it coming Oh Curry! :)"}
{"text":"Food here is great, simple curry nothing over the top. a place to go when you want to get a really good taste of curry in your mouth."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best curry in town. I have been trying other spots in different states and I always love coming back to this spot in the eastside of Vegas. If you know japanese curry you will be truly happy with the food here.  The owner is a really down to earth guy and nice cool spot to hang out."}
{"text":"Amazing food! You can see why it's a \"National\" dish in Japan!! Friendly staff! Military Discounts!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly one of the best tasting Japanese-Style curry spots I've had in a while. Very early in its stages, but very good curry!  Owner is very accommodating. Good spot!"}
{"text":"Good price, good food, small restaurant. Curry spice level can be adjusted to your liking. If you weak or whateva. Great place with a family vibe."}
{"text":"The owners make curry the way it should be made and more then passionate about what they do. I have been here many  times now, and every time with no concern to if its in person or having someone pick up the food for me, the owners are amazing people with a gift for curry. Always helpful and ALWAYS great tasting."}
{"text":"First experience having Japanese curry.We loved it.The owner Hide was gracious in his service and recommendations. GREAT value also.Will definitely return."}
{"text":"After coming here multiple times and hearing the grief my friends have of this place I have to change this review.  Over time the curry seems to be water down with what seems to taste like sand.  The spice levels are inconsistent. But the service that I have receive has always been flawless. Until today I guess? Passive aggressive service. Haha   The menu up until recently has been out of date with the beef curry still hanging on the back wall though it has been discontinued. And for the soda machine that only has one to two options available at all times. The cup size has gotten smaller but the price has still stayed the same.  Although the quality has seem to gone down the price has seem to gone up a bit."}
{"text":"This is definitely going to be one of our new favorite places to eat! The service was wonderful, food is excellent, and it's a yummy Asian place on the east side! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Best curry I've had so far! Been to Okinawa, Japan and it definitely beat out Coco's, smallish portions but just enough to fill you up. Went with the og chicken cutlet and reminded me immediately of Japan, nice small place that packs a punch. 5/5 will come again."}
{"text":"Owner runs his store so he makes sure you are happy with everything.  Curry was fantastic.  I had the hot which I really enjoyed. His salad was super fresh and delicious. Rice was cooked perfect which is pretty important and the owner offer additional rice at no charge.  Great prices, great food and great service. If you haven't tried Japanese curry do yourself the favor!"}
{"text":"So good !!! Great prices too. I like this place better than Japanese Curry Zen in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmy.  This was the first curry place I tried when I moved to Vegas a few months ago!  You order at the counter and they serve you the food!  It was good and portions were HUGE!  The curry is definitely on the more aromatic and savory side over which really compliments the katsu well.  I ordered the combo with both pork and chicken katsu and that was definitely the way to go for first timers.  I preferred the chicken because of moisture, taste, and texture--in case you're determined to only go with one.  Also add the cheese for an extra 50 cents.  It makes the curry so much creamier.  I've never been to Japan, so I can't vouch for how \"authentic\" it is, but growing up in so-cal, I've been exposed to several curry spots, including chains from Japan.  I wouldn't quite rate it up there with my favorite places (Mitsuwa food court), but it's still good and I'd come back.  Also, when coming here, you guys have to try the coffee jello...such a refreshing, stimulating dessert to help wake you up after such a carbo-loaded food coma inducing meal.  Also, the owner was super nice.  He's helpful and sweet--he even told about what restaurants I should try around the area since there's so limited options in north Vegas.  Definitely coming back again."}
