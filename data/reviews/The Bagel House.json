{"text":"The Bagel House is a chain of stores that serves Montreal style bagels. The owners learned the bagel bakery business from their days working in Montreal. This location has seating for 14. The Bayview location is open 24/7.  As you would expect from a bagel shop, you can order a toasted bagel with one of their in house made creamy style cream cheese, lox and cream cheese bagel, sandwiches like Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich. There are other items available like turnovers, muffins. The usual selection of beverages are available like coffee, juices, milk, soft drinks.  The Bagel House's selection of fresh delivered bagels are more expensive than Tim Hortons, but they are not fresh \"frozen\" reheated bagels like Tim Hortons. One dozen day old bagels are $4 plus HST.  On my 2 visits to this location, I ordered a toasted bagel with herb and garlic cream cheese, and a coffee. I was satisfied with the food. The customer service was good and the tables were clean. This might be a good place to do some work as it is very quiet here."}
{"text":"The Bagel House has the worst customer service the bagels get hard the next day wasn't told to freeze them otherwise they have to be thrown out! I was only told this after I purchased 6 called the store they told me they would replace only to go in and told me no and that I did not purchase from Yonge store and it's the only location I have been too. I followed up with the manager at the Avenue store which is the HQ the male manager I spoke to was unprofessional and rude!!! He accused me of eating them because I didn't bring back the same day even tho the store on Younge said it was fine to come back on the weekend. Bagel House is not worth the overpriced crappy bagels!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about the bagels. Just ok. Tables are always dirty. Costumer service is bad. Coffee is fine."}
{"text":"I went in for takeout and have so far consumed half a plain Montreal bagel. Delicious. Remaining bagels will be sliced and tossed into my freezer.  I don't know that I would eat in at this place. Clientele looked to be in yucky moods and for all the people working there the eat-in area was not clean."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service. The server was so rude and charged me for my own water bottle that I brought from home lol"}
{"text":"Tried Bagel House today for the first and sadly the last time. The yelp universe says that the bagels are great but the service is terrible. I found the opposite to be true. I took no issue with the customer service I received it was friendly and courteous. I took issue with the bagels which were burnt and tasteless, very dense as well denser then I was expecting.   The only thing that was not disappointing was the cherry Turnover which was large and looked homemade. It was best part of the experience.   My Bagel search continues."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed that I overpaid for a stale bagel with a sliver of lox. I gave this place a second chance- and I am in shock that they continue to serve subpar sandwiches. Truly and utterly disappointed. Step up or step out."}
