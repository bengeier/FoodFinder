{"text":"Great new coffee bar & eatery place.  Our first visit  here today.  We had great service and great coffee.  They had many choices of coffee and tea.  Met the owners of the place. They were very friendly and very helpful in helping me decide. I ended with the gingerbread mocha coffee. It was the best mocha I ever had.  They also serve sandwiches, salads, soup and sweets like muffins,danish scones and, brownies . This will be my new  favorite coffee bar & eatery !"}
{"text":"Check this place out if you get a chance, they have great coffee and food (sandwiches, soups, salads, and fruit) Quiet atmosphere, WiFi, amazingly clean bathrooms, big tables, comfy chairs, free magazines, a TV in one corner, and you won't smell like yesterdays microwaved bacon sandwich when you leave like some other places. A 16 oz organic, locally roasted coffee is under $2."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in the Lake Norman / Huntersville area. Great local roasted, organic coffee and the usual breakfast treats. Very friendly and serene atmosphere. Free WiFi is a bonus. The perfect place to meet a friend for coffee or get some work done."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time this a.m. on my way to work. This place is very cute and seemed to have a lots of lunch menu options. I grabbed a coffee and slice of banana walnut bread to-go. I usually stick to Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts for my coffee but the coffee here is definitly good enough to make it my regular place.    I hope they survive! I only knew about this place from getting sushi next door at Coral at which point they had been closed. I am thinking if they were open the same times Coral were open they would get more people wandering over there, maybe for coffee and desert after dinner."}
{"text":"This quaint little coffee bar/eatery is a nice addition to the Birkdale area.  They have a great selection of coffees as well as sandwiches and other dishes that looked great when I read them on the wall.  There is plenty of seating, though a few rugs I think would tone down the noise as when I was there a group of folks were meeting (good sign), but with all the concrete floors I had to raise my voice a bit to talk to my GF sitting beside me.  Folks are friendly and food and drinks are served promptly.  Interesting thing about the coffee...they serve the cups with cork (or what appeared to be cork) sleeves?  Not sure how green this is or perhaps it is more green than cardboard sleves, but when I looked in the trash throwing my cup away it just looked a bit weird to see all those nice cork sleeves just going to land fill?????  ******************************************************* \"UPDATE:  Sue the owner was nice enough to reach out to me and provide some background on the cork sleeves...........  Quick Cork Facts: *  Cork is one of the most environmentally friendly materials in the world.  *  Cork is harvested simply by peeling off the outer layer of bark of the cork oak. *  The bark grows back within nine years and the tree actually benefits from being farmed by giving it a longer life.  *  Cork trees that are harvested can live over 200 years.  *  Cork oak forests create a unique habitat that is home to many endangered species such as the Iberian lynx and the imperial eagle in Europe and the Golden Takin and Golden Monkey in the Quinling Mountains of Central Asia. *  Cork's cellular structure is what gives it its unique properties as 60% of it is air trapped between fibers.  *  It is hypoallergenic, recyclable, biodegradable, insulating and waterproof....................................................  \" *******************************************************  But don't let that sway you from visiting this great little place.......once it gets warm, hopefully they'll put out seating out front!"}
{"text":"Love love love this new coffee shop!!!  Excellent coffee and super friendly staff!  I'm so happy to have a REAL coffee shop on my way to work.  I was getting tired of going to Starbucks and drinking their burnt tasting coffee! I will definitely be a \"regular\" at this place!  Definitely check it out.  Their prices seem very good too!  I got a small vanilla latte for just over $3.  Works for me! :)"}
{"text":"Very cool setup! I just love the trendy local cafe feel in this joint. I have honestly been looking for more cafes in the area to substitute for Starbucks in Birkdale. Unfortunately the Nook has some very strange hours and I'm never able to get in here. It would be great if they were open late with free wifi like Starbucks then I'd certainly find myself in here in the evenings surfing the web rather than at the old cliche. I'll try my best to stop back by to sit with some hot tea and conversation."}
{"text":"The miss' and I went here for lunch today to spend a Groupon I had recently purchased. It's a cosy little coffee/sandwich/pastry shop with plenty of food and drink options. You might pay a tad bit more for lunch than you usually would but you're going to get a great experience.  First off, kudos for the use of Boars Head cold cuts! I ordered the \"Leo\" sandwich which was basically an Italian sub. It was mighty tasty with ham, capi, salami, pepperoni and provolone on a good-sized hoagie roll. There was also some fresh tomato slices, and instead of the usual shredded lettuce you would get they apply a nice spring mix of greens. The miss' got a turkey pesto sandwich which was mighty tasty. It was so good in fact that I had to beg her just to get a little taste! Both our sandwiches were considered their \"specialities\", and each cost $7.45 and came with either chips or fresh fruit (we both got the apple). They had basic sandwiches that were a little cheaper. There were also a couple of salads and some daily specials; today's were chili and also a pulled pork sandwich.   There are also tons of coffees and other hot beverages to choose from. The miss' is a huge hot drink fan and she loved her ginger bread latte. I'm not a big coffee fan so I figured I would try the frozen hot chocolate. I took my first sip to find that there was a hint of coffee in it. Even though I will never drink a cup of straight-up coffee, the faint essence that was mixed in with the chocolate made an excellent combination. I was shocked to find that I really enjoyed my drink!  It's a nice local substitute to places like Panera and Starbucks. It cost about the same as a trip to Panera would cost (maybe even a little less, depending on what you order) but the sandwiches were much better. I've had the Italian sandwich at Panera, and I definitely prefer the one from The Nook. While there is a limited food menu compared to Panera, there are a lot more hot drinks to choose from. The staff were very friendly and I was more than happy to eat lunch here and support this little shop. If you are looking for a nice cold cut sandwich or a hot drink to fuel your holiday shopping spree, I would recommend coming to The Nook. Speaking of holiday shopping, did I mention it's conveniently located right across from Birkdale? Definitely give the place a try if you're in the area."}
