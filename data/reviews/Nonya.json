{"text":"On a steamy summer night in the middle of a heat wave I decided to get out of the house and try Nonya. I haven't had many chances to try Indonesian, so I was very excited when I stumbled across it a few weeks ago.  At the recommendation of the server, I waited a few minutes for an outdoor table (it was pretty warm inside). While I waited at the bar she brought me some water and salted peanuts to snack on. Once seated I got a homemade mint lemon/limeade (delicious, but a little pricier than expected at $4), more peanuts, and shrimp chips. I ordered the Indonesian-style crispy duck leg ($18), which came with rice and a few scoops of sides (okra, curried tofu, and some type of shredded pickled vegetable). The duck was tender and moist with very crispy skin (deep-fried?). Each of the sides were distinctly flavoured, although the yellow curry was a bit mild for my taste. The portions weren't huge, so I think I would get an appetiser next time. It was all very tasty! I can't wait to go back with a few people so I can try out the rest of their dishes.  One thing to note, one of the previous reviews mentioned wine. I was told they couldn't serve alcohol, but maybe this only applies to the patio?"}
{"text":"We bought a groupon for Nonya for a seafood tasting menu. I think the reason nonya is on groupon is because they are pending a liquor license. We were ok without booze for the dinner. We each had a coconut water instead. The menu was very good, specifically the fish and the duck. The duck fell off the bone and was equally crispy and tender. I feel for a tasting menu it seemed a little small- I wasn't stuffed at all but I was satisfied. It was all presented very nicely and the service was good. Do not, however, attempt to order a coffee- this is not their specialty!! The panacotta for dessert was creamy and delicious."}
{"text":"If you've never had Indonesian food before, you are in for a serious treat as this a very refined Indonesian. I had some sort of braised coconut beef curry and it was out of this world. Paired nicely with the shrimp chips, pickled vegetables and the sriracha \"jam\". Portion size was perfect."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The owner is very gentle and his service towards loyal customers is great! The food is always constantly delicious and there has been no flaws to point out regardless of the great number of times we have been there!"}
{"text":"So, I had really high expectations coming here as I've grown up eating Indonesian food my whole life, but what a disappointment this experience was. :(  I had a reservation for 6:00 for 3 but arrived a bit late, however we were seated quickly and the waiter was pretty nice about it. Alright, I'm not sure if we just came on an off-day but it seemed like there were only 2 waiters on the floor for a dinner crowd so it took a VERY long time for anyone to take our order and even longer for the actual food to come out. If you order from the Table d'hote you'll at least get some soup and salad before the actual plates come out but if not then prepare for a long wait.  Okay, so when my food came out I was more than ready to dig in. At this point I've waited pretty close to an hour and was starving but the food really wasn't anything that I expected. The presentation? Really nice/elegant but the taste was super salty. I ordered, Bakso Babi (fried beef balls), Satay Ayam (grilled chicken skewers), Sing Kang Goreng (fried cassava), and Nasi Kuning (yellow rice). And everything, aside from the Nasi Kuning, was way too salty for me! I couldn't eat anything without the the Nasi Kuning to help wash it down.   The dessert was the only other redeeming dish I had, black rice in coconut milk which was really good and it was sweet that they put a candle on mine since it was my birthday, but by the time we left, it was 9:30pm and the bill came out to be around $40. Definitely would not come again."}
{"text":"The Indonesian-style poutine was the most exciting thing I ate in Montreal!  We came here on the recommendation of a co-worker, because my Indonesian husband needed his rice fix, and we were not disappointed. In fact, we ate here twice during our four days in town. It's a little bit rare to see any kind of Indonesian fusion cooking, and it's great that Chef Ivan is pushing the boundaries with things like creme brulee pandan and the aforementioned poutine. The more traditional Indonesian dishes like beef rendang, chicken and (especially) beef sate, gudeg nangka and nasi kuning are also quite good, as is the crispy duck.   Can't wait to come back to Montreal so we can eat here again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! They have a large selection of dishes; I've been here four times, haven't tried them all, and haven't been disappointed yet. Table d'hote comes with a number of small (2-3 bites) sides, which provide an excellent opportunity for the chefs to show off their skills, and the diner to maximize the diversity of their flavor experience.  The service has always been friendly, and the ambiance is not overly trendy. It's music and decor are both traditional Indonesian. The lunch and tapas specials are very reasonably priced.  The peanut+anchovy appetizer, laksa, and beef rendang, are so good that they make it difficult to try new things when I go. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Très belle expérience.  Ambiance très sympathique.  On s'entend parler, c'est déjà beaucoup.  Bouffe succulente.  Accueil chaleureux.  Beaucoup d'entregent et de bons conseils.  Véritable coup de coeur pour le ragoût de boeuf dont j'avais entendu beaucoup de bien.  Pleinement mérité.  La cuisine indonésienne est savoureuse à souhait.  On y retourne?  Absolument.  Encore mieux avec le rabais Accès Resto.  Pour le dessert, je n'ai pas cherché à explorer les possibilités."}
{"text":"4 stars for this authentic and delicious food! But at those prices I would like to have something on my plate, and not wait 1 full hour to get my meal!"}
{"text":"I had a really pleasant dinner at Nonya the other night. I love Indonesian food and my meal at Nonya was delicious. I had the Vegan Delights (very much appreciated the vegan options), which was a fantastic spread of saffron rice, curry tofu, shredded coconut, jackfruit (both the coconut and jackfruit were really well prepared), spicy cucumber, fried cassava, crispy taro, and a skewer each of tempeh and tofu with a sweet soy sauce. The omnivores all enjoyed their meals, too. If I weren't vegan, I would have been excited to try Nonya's Indonesian take on poutine, which sounds fun. The outdoor seating area is very pleasant on a nice summer evening. The service was kind, though not overly attentive. We weren't in a rush, though, and I very much enjoyed the meal and would happily go back."}
{"text":"What a fantastic meal! From the bowl of garlicky peanuts served when we sat down, to the black rice pudding at the end, everything was fabulous - the gado gado salad; the amazing cornish hen in red curry; the spicy beef curry, every element of this surprisingly elaborate dish laid out separately - beautiful plating!  The table d'hôte is reasonably priced, and there is a good selection of wines by the glass or carafe.  The only thing that knocks Nonya down from five stars to four is the really, really long wait between courses. If we'd known, we would have ordered a bottle instead of a half-litre."}
{"text":"A friend invited me to try this place and of course given that I had never tried Indonesian cuisine I gladly accepted.  We arrived around 8:30, the restaurant was not full, so lucky us we could be seated at the terrace (which was very nice btw I particularly liked the lights). We ordered a selection of Indonesian specialties and everything tasted amazingly well. Their cocktail and wine selection is extensive and eclectic. I would recommend this place for the very good service and food, and will definitely be going back in the near future."}
{"text":"The food we had was good, decent Indonesian with modern touch. If only we didn't have to wait for ages for our food. The second time there it was much better, faster service that makes the food even more tastier. I'll go back for the thirt time the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Quelle belle découverte culinaire! Cherchant un nouveau lieu à essayer j'ai trouvé cet endroit dans un de mes guides touristiques de Montréal (et oui à l'heure du tout internet, les livres ont encore leur place chez moi!). Nous n'avions pas trop d'idée de ce que nous allions trouver et ne connaissant pas la cuisine Indonésienne nous avons pris un menu dégustation et avons suivi les recommandations du chef. Quel plaisir de voir arriver tout ces petits plats colorés, viandes en sauce, poissons en sauce, légumes cuisinés, le tout servi avec du riz. J'ai particulièrement aimé les plats très épicés et comme le reste de ma famille préférait les plats moins épicés, finalement tout le monde est reparti ravi! L'intérieur du resto est intimiste et jai aimé la décoration et aussi le bâtiment qui avait un certain charme et cachet. Je préfère les lieux avec une âme plutôt qu'ultra modernes et aseptisés. Ce repas a été une expérience, il ne faut pas être pressé et savoir apprécier la diversité de ce qui est présenté. J'ai recommandé ce lieu a mes amis et j'y retournerai sans hésiter!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambience. I was told by the waiter that they no longer offer their famous testing set menu (rijstaffel) since some of dishes are seasonal. But the waiter was kind enough to ask the chef and he prepared it for us.. Some season dishes were replaced and we were happy!!"}
{"text":"Je suis allé à ce restaurant pour fêter mon anniversaire avec des amis.  Certains parmi ceux-ci avaient suggérer le Nonya.  Je peux dire que je n'ai pas été déçu.  Ce qui m'a surpris est q'un pour un samedi soir, le restaurant était très tranquille.  Ce qui n'est pas un défaut car on pouvait très bien s'entendre sans nécessairement crier.  Le service était très courtois et attentionné.    Nous avons tous pris pour commencer un drink (dont j'oublie le nom) à base de liqueur de pruneaux sous la recommandation de la serveuse et nous étions tous satisfaits.  Vous avez différentes options quant au menu: à la carte, la table d'hôte pour 27$ (entrées, plats principaux et desserts) et le menu dégustation pour 40$ ou 45$.  Pour ma part, j'y suis allé pour les calmars en entrée.  Ils étaient bons mais sans être exceptionnels.  J'ai ensuite pris le ragoût de boeuf qui était savoureux.  Les accompagnements l'étaient tout autant.  J'ai eu un faible pour le riz au jasmin cuit au curcuma et lait de coco.  J'ai eu la chance de goûter à quelques plats des autres convives et ils étaient tous très bons.  Le prix des plats est également tout à fait raisonnable.  Une deuxième visite s'impose!!"}
{"text":"I had a business trip to Montreal last month and got a chance to try this place. I ordered some tapas menu so I got to try different things before I got full. Lamb skewer (sate kambing), shrimp crackers, with jasmine rice. The presentation was really good, though that was not how normally indonesian food is served. Taste was also good, Im not picky eater but their food made me came back for another trip. Then I closed my meal with sticky sweet black rice in coconut milk, really delicious. Next trip here, I ordered gado2, rice cake, and some spring rolls. Again presentation was really good, and taste met my expectation. If I have more nights here then I might come back to try more menus. Two times to this restaurant my waiting time was reasonable, they were other tables with group of people but I never felt abandoned. I would give 5 stars if they have more dessert selection. ."}
{"text":"Rijsttafel...aaaw yeah!  Random info: Rijsttafel is a Dutch word and it means \" ricetable\".  $40 = a (happy) stuffed little piggy.  My favo food of the evening: Sop Labu Kuning, Gado Gado, Rendang & Ayam panggang.  Worth the pain (too much food!).  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had a lovely experience at Nonya. I ordered the vegan table d'hôte and was pleasantly surprised by the variety of the dishes. Every item was carefully prepared and presented. I'm curious about the multiple reviewers who claimed the food was too salty; I wonder if this is only characteristic of their meat, because I am pretty sensitive to overly sweet or salty foods, and none of the dishes I tried could be described as either. I found everything delicious and created with attention to detail. While the portions for each dish are small (it's more of a tasting menu), each bite was delightful. The restaurant also has a selection of wine which paired perfectly with the meal.   The only drawbacks are that the wait-time to receive the food was a little long, and the portion sizes were on the small side. This wasn't a problem for me, but someone with a more robust appetite might have left a little hungry. The food is also on the pricey side - the table d'hôte + one glass of the cheapest wine each for two people came to $100 with tax and tip. While I don't think this is unreasonable for the quality and presentation of the dinner, it would make it difficult for me to come here on a more regular basis.   All in all, a great little gem that I would definitely recommend. I look forward to a second visit. :)"}
{"text":"Nonya is a great Indonesian restaurant. The food is absolutely delicious. A bit of advice: the minimum number of people for a rijstafel is four, with advance notice. Next time, I'll plan a bit more in advance."}
{"text":"Was z little inebriated and chillaxed from an earlier soiree.  Needed some food to balance out. This place totally supported and enhanced my \"happy place\".   Every dish was really delish and the server was so genuinely sweet_ like coconut water. Such a nice evening vibe on the outdoor patio.  So close to home.  i will be back."}
{"text":"Thank the LORD, there exists decent (even, dare I say, delectable) thai curry in Montreal! I know, I know, it's an Indonesian restaurant, but I won't lie and say that I know the difference between the two cuisines. To me, the flavors were quite similar, although I have never had thai food presented the way it's done at Nonya. I'd love to be enlightened-- some sort of explanation about Indonesian cooking on the menu would be much appreciated. But I'm a nerd.   All I do know is that the yellow curry soup was delicious, (albeit slightly mild, but hey, it is still Montreal) and the Sumatran stewed beef was so tender it  melted in my mouth-- peanut and curry flavors bursting with every bite. My man's duck confit came right off the bone- no need for a knife-- and had perfectly crispy skin. The mains were presented alongside rice in a beautiful banana-leaf basket, really delicious roasted eggplant, a big prawn cracker, some sort of cold slaw that was refreshing, and a craving-inducing sauce (on the side!) that reminded me of hoisin but was so much better.   My only criticism has to be that the table d'hote ($27) includes a dessert, but when you get the dessert menu you are informed that everything but the rice pudding will run you an extra $3. Being non-rice-pudding-fans, we were fine to pay for an order of ice cream and creme brulee, but none too pleased when we were presented with 1 scoop of store-bought ice-cream and probably 3 tablespoons of creme brulee- though it was delicious. Felt a little scammy to us, but I guess that's what you get when you order table d'hote. We resolved to order off the a la carte menu next time. And we will be back again. I'm sick of going back to Ottawa every time I get a craving for coconut milk and curry."}
{"text":"We roamed around the city and ran into this restaurant, it was surprisingly good.  The atmosphere was good, services was great and the food was excellent.  We ordered sambal chicken, it was very spicy with a lot of flavors.  Grilled chicken in red curry (Ayam Bakar), it is not like what it sounds, it is a lightly fried chicken and not greasy, maybe it was marinated with red curry and was delicious.  Laksa soup has a different taste, but was also good.  Almost forgot to mention about the Indonesian fusion poutine, it is quite amazing.  Pleasant dinner with family while visited from west coast. Will definitely come back again before we go back home."}
{"text":"Horrible. Experience. I seem to be the only one that had such a terrible experience. Hear me out  I bought a coupon off of Groupon. Reservations were for 7. We got seated at 7:30 (I get it. They're busy). We got a menu 45 minutes later... no water, no alcohol, no nothing... The waited came back to see my table about 45-06 minutes after and took our menu and placed the order for us........ WITHOUT US PLACING THE ORDER!!. Eh excuse me. can I choose my food??  I had overheard someone from another table mentioning something about nuts in the sauces of this resto.. now we have a BIG problem seeing as how my boyfriend is highly allergic to nuts. We went to go see the waited and asked to ensure the food not be made with nuts however all their sauces are made from a nut base and it cannot be removed. So we waited about an hour and 45min to two hours, got NOTHING at all (NO WATER OR ANYTHING.. NOT EVEN A NAPKIN!!) and had to leave. Thank god Panos is close by.. I will never step foot into this place."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants that we visited on our trip to Montreal. The food was wonderful and the service was amazing. I thought the menu was a little confusing, but one of the co-owners herself came to our table and explained how to order. The food took a little time to come out, but the wait was totally worth it. The food was amazing. If this is what authentic Indonesian food tastes like, then I love Indonesian food. The presentation of the food was remarkable. I enjoyed the flower shaped red pepper very much. Everything about the meal was worth every bit of money, especially the dessert. Excellent!!! At the end of the meal they gave us a coffee flavored candy called a Kopiko. Yum!!! This is a must go restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Nonya and was delighted by their yellow curry and my dining partner was absolutely in awe by their rendang curry. Both were light, flavourful and a delight to savour.   I also tried their vegetable tempura which I wouldn't recommend ; it was oily and the batter left a slightly bitter taste in ones mouth.  However, it really didn't sway my opinion of this place too much; the curries were just too fantastic! If you're ordering delivery from them; their tofu yellow curry is a small portion so order two for a full meal!"}
{"text":"Very nice place serving authentic tasting Indonesian food.  We visited this restaurant following a groupon purchase.  The service was unrushed so if your looking for fast food then go to McDonalds : )  My advice would be to bring your appetite and have a open mind about trying new things and give this place a try."}
{"text":"I had never had Indonesian food before so when there was a Living Social deal for the restaurant it seemed like something worth trying.  The deal got you the Rijstaffel (tasting menu) for $20 when it is normally $40.   It's a small restaurant but the decor and ambiance is quite fitting for an Asian place.    A ton of food comes with the Rujstaffel option.  A lot of the menu items were flavoured with coconut and lemongrass so my guess is that these two ingredients are important in Indonesian cuisine.   The meats (beef and chicken) were very tender and just fell apart.  I also was a fan of the chili peanut sauce that came with the chicken.  The dessert featured sticky rice in coconut milk and was really good as well as green tea creme brulee.  I must admit I found the creme brulee a bit odd but the other dessert was quite good.  The service was slightly on the slow side but that was my only major real issue with the place.   Overall I think I would definitely come back to this place.  It;s a great little restaurant when you're looking for something out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Authentic Indonesian is a bit of a rarity in Montreal but Nonya does just fine. The beef rendang is particularly good. The service was friendly. I came here with a group and everyone left quite satisfied. I do suggest trying out the reijstaffel menu so you get to taste a bit of everything. I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly wait staff. Delicious food options. Veg friendly. Next time we're in Montreal, we'll definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"we had the 2 person tasting menu Terre et Mer . Very desapointing except the beef and a spicy chicken drained in a very salty sauce. The other plates were too salty aswell. The lamb kabab was overcooked. The shrimp was ok. The cod in coconut sauce was too liquid and tbe eggplants were not cooked. The squid and zucchini were a joke in some tastless italian tomato sauce. All this for 100$ for 2 people. Never again. I should of known from the moment i walked in not a single asian table."}
{"text":"Nonya might be upscale but the flavor definitely tastes homemade. I am a Malaysian myself but the food reminds me of home. I would suggest their table d'hote because it is a pretty good deal if you ask me.   My meal started with gado gado, a salad with a wonderful peanut sauce. Then came my entree - bebek bengil which is fried duck leg, perfectly crunchy on the outside but oh so tender on the inside, served with rice and the vegetable of the day. Did I mention that we also get complimentary krupuk udang or prawn crackers to go with the meal? We had a platter of four desserts because we decided to try all of them. A must try is their pandan flavored creme brulee.   Service was rather slow but the food were carefully plated with all the details. It was worth the wait. Since the restaurant is more upscale, they also don't offer street/hawker style dessert like es campur, which we were craving for. Last but not least, they gave us each a Kopiko candy which is a favorite in South east Asia.   Overall, it was a great experience for all of us. I wish the portions were bigger. They were so tiny, I could eat three portions myself. Nevertheless, this definitely won't be my last time here."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Indonesian Food. My wife and I visited montreal in october of 2007, we were only in the area for a few days, and wanted to try different kinds of foods. This place was pretty unique. It is a reijstaffel style restaurant, where you order for 2 or more people, they bring the food out to you one dish at a time, you can choose from some of the items: fish, beef or pork. We had some vanilla ice cream and lapis legit there.   Our waitress was quebecois, but also spoke english. She explained all the different foods to us as she brought them out and also took the time to make sure our water was full and that we were comfortable in our chairs. After our meal was almost finished he chef came out and wished us 'salamt makan' or a happy meal. So we asked for him and he sat down and told us the history or his place, how long he had been there, etc. It is a family business, him his sister and parents help out.  This is the third or fourth location of this restaurant, it has moved a few different times. They accept cash, credit and in the winter are only open for dinner 5p - 9p. original review (pre-yelp canada)"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. I didn't expect to find a good Indonesian restaurant in Montreal but this is one of the best I've ever been to, even better than the ones I've been to in San Francisco. Mind you, my sample size isn't extensive.  I'd suggest going for the tasting menu (Rijsttafel). It's a little expensive (40-45$ per person) but you get to taste a little bit of everything. They also have a table d'hote special from Monday to Wednesday (I believe): 3 course meal from 20 to 23$.  The owner of the restaurant is also really nice."}
{"text":"Afin de fêter l'anniversaire de l'ami de mon amoureuse, on m'invitr à ce resto au coeur du Mile-End un samedi soir. Nous marchons le quartier qui est charmant, plein de restos vegans, des friperies superbes, pâtisseries,  épiceries et gens créatifs et originaux. Nous commandons et notre serveuse est charmante vive sympathique sexy parfaite ! Le repas est délicieux,  copieux et savoureux.  Le service excellent et pour un prix honnête."}
