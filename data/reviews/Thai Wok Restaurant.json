{"text":"Excellent General Tao chicken. Not just fat and skin like most places. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We tried the Thai Wok last night. It's in our neighborhood so we thought we would give it a try. Unfortunately, like most Thai restaurants it was mediocre. Let's start with the positives -spring rolls were great -Tofu and vegetables were good and the cashew chicken was good.  The cons  -Papaya salad not enough spice! Wheres the chilies! Like most Thai restaurants, they are afraid to make the dish the way it's suppose to be served...with bite!  -Pad Thai, again another Thai restaurant bungle! Ketchup based sauce...Pad Thai needs to b made from scratch with Tamarind paste.  Overall, a decent Thai restaurant in the east end.....but i would take the drive to Young Thailand any day for a \"real\" Thai food experience."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. The place is located in a side-by-side row next to dumpy homes, dry cleaners and an auto body lot. I only went because I drove back from work and did not feel like cooking myself. Well looks can be deceiving. It's actually not bad inside. Albeit empty, b/c as it turns out it seems to be more of a take-out place than a dine-in favorite, but it's fairly quaint for the area.  I enjoyed the chicken coconut soup which is a tomyum based lemongrass standard in Thai cuisine and it went down rather nicely with just the right amount of chili, fish sauce and soy. As main course I needed to try their pad thai as this is the most basic staple dish a real thai place needs to master (it's like Shepherd's Pie in Irish diners or Schnitzel with Sauerkraut in Germany). Really and truly not bad at all. I've seen and tasted a lot worse, this one is quite up there. Fresh ingredients, no dreaded ketchup sauce and fresh chicken and shrimp. Speedy service (duh, you're the only guest).  This restaurant sells the cheapest domestic bottle-beers I've ever seen in a Toronto restaurant - $2.50!!! Wow! If you feel like Thai give the Wok a try, but order delivery in case you tend to feel lonely in a completely empty restaurant and/or cheap beer with dinner is not your thing."}
{"text":"Great for take out. Always beats expectation.  Service is good. Food is hot and fresh! We live very close so it's a go to for last minute pick up. Delivery this close would be a lazy crime."}
{"text":"Oh boy do I have a lot to say about this place. It's great! I love the food! I'd eat there every day if I could. I've been going there since they opened in like 1998 I believe... Wonderful place! The lady that works at the counter is very nice. I can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"I have never actually gone to the restaurant in person but have been ordering from them for the past 11 years and have never had a single complaint. The food is always mouthwatering and the delivery is fast. my favourite dishes there are  - pineapple chicken curry - coconut chicken soup - pad thai"}
{"text":"- Decent food, basil beef was delicious and great spice- however, overall, nothing too special. Good solid choice for lazy night in, esp. if north of Mortimer- nice and close!"}
{"text":"Watery curry, processed chicken. The worst thai food i've ever had"}
{"text":"We have ordered from many Thai restaurants in the area, and always seem to return to Thai Wok, just celebrating their 10th year anniversary.  Small little restaurant, we've never gone to \"eat in\", though driving by we see you can.  Our order is always hot and delicious, and they always get our order right.  Some favourite dishes are:  - Mango Tofu (though Chef Special Mango Chicken is also very good - and importantly, not breaded!)  - Cashew Chicken  - Beef Curry  - Spicy Pork or Beef  - Lemongrass Chicken  - Pad Thai (of course)  - Thai Spicy Noodle (we like with beef)  We have not tried the seafood because H is allergic (boooo), and usually just make our own brown jasmine rice at home  You get free spring rolls with order over $25 & chicken wings (breaded) or lemon chicken (also breaded) with orders over $35  Price seems to be average for Thai takeout."}
{"text":"Love it!  Great portion sizes, super fast delivery, delicious food.  Have noticed it's closed now though... hopefully just for refurbishment?"}
