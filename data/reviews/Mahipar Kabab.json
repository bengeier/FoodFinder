{"text":"The food was okay not the greatest. My chicken didn't taste fresh. The owner was extremely nice and well mannered he give me free firnee  which is a dessert. My order came with rice, salad, pieces of chicken breakfast and a shish kabab for 12.99My sister ordered hers without rice was 10.99. Which is decently priced.   The owner had to make a delivery and the country was left unattended and so were we, the only customers in the store. Although there were people working in the back kitchen no one came to check up on us. Finally when it was time to pay I was over charged. But it's all the way in Pickering so it's okay.   I wouldn't go there again and wouldn't really recommend it to anyone either since the food isn't outstanding or authentic tasting."}
{"text":"Food was fresh however service was kinds slow No music just soccer playing on TV for the cashier to watch I did enjoy however food aspect it was nice kabab. Great portions too! Lamb chops wicked bit salty"}
{"text":"I grew up on Middle Eastern food, and can honestly say this food as authentic. I find it a bit too spicy, but that's only because I'm not use to it. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We first came to Mahipar in April only days after they had opened and although it was dinner time, it seemed as though they were quite unorganised and not prepared to receive customers.   We ordered two combo plates, Shish & Chicken Kebab and Shish & Tikka Kebab. The combos included rice (with raisins and carrots... qabili?), salad and naan. The rice was really delicious however, all of the meet was extremely overcooked and very dry.   The service was mediocre at best but like I said, they seemed very unorganised when we arrived so I chalked it up to them being a new restaurant trying to get their bearings. I chose not to review at the time because of this.  We came here again the other night for dinner and this time we were met by a kid with a less than enthusiastic attitude. We opted for the same dishes and took our seats. (On a side note, at this time I made the mistake of visiting the lady's room... don't do it... ever.)  Our food came, this time without the fancy rice. The meat was again, completely overcooked leaving it tough and with very little flavour. Quite disappointing.  I'm confused by the service and quality consistency at this restaurant. We asked about the rice that was served the last time we were here but we were told that it doesn't come with this combo and would cost extra... even though it did come with the combo last time and our dinner was slightly more expensive this time.  I truly am struggling between a 1 and 2 star rating. For me, a 2 star rating means I've had better but I'll definitely give them a second chance... a 1 star rating means no second chance, period! Since I reserved my review the first time, this technically IS the second chance... there won't be a third."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  I spotted Mahipar Kabab just by chance while driving home from work one day, and didn't know that Pickering is home to a new Afghan restaurant, so I went to check it out for lunch today, and learned that they just opened last Friday.  The menu is enormous, and includes a number of classic Afghan dishes, like mantoo , boolanee, qabili palaw, various types of kebab including chaplee kebab, sabzi, and shorwa (only on Tuesday apparently).  Basically, anything that someone would suggest is the very essence of Afghan cuisine is here.  Rather than having one of the $6.99 lunch specials, I went with a big meal - qabili palaw with lubya (red beans in a spiced tomato sauce, think \"Afghan chili\"?). The lamb was nicely seasoned and tender, and the portion was enormous - I could have shared it. Accompanied by a nice glass of doogh (salty, minty, sort of yogurt beverage, like ayran/labneh) it was quite a meal indeed.  And the setting was beautiful too, a nicely furnished comfortable, really rather posh sit-down restaurant that also offers take out and catering services.  I wish Abdul and his partners much success."}
