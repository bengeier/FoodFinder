{"text":"Very cool place with nice ambiance! The host was very nice and each time he sat a table of guests down he would spend time explaining the menu and eating method to them. However, it seemed like the other korean waitresses don't speak English very well as we asked for clarification of the different types of meat they offer.

There was a minimum order of 2 things per table, so me and my bf ordered pork belly and the beef chuck flat tall. The meat quality was really good! The pork belly wan't too fat and the beef had a really nice meat taste to it, unlike other Chines kbbq or kbbq place I've been to around the area/in Markham. When you order meat for bbq, the meal also comes with lots of side dishes, lettuces for you to wrap the meat in, dipping sauce, and eggs and creamy corn with cheese on the side of the grill. Everything other than the meat is refillable, in fact the creamy corn with cheese was so delicious that we got a refill of it. Note that rice has to be ordered on the side."}
{"text":"So good :) the eggs, corn and cheese are free to refill on the outer rim! Reminds me of the KBBQ in LA!"}
{"text":"Good service ~ good food ~ didnt have to wait ... Rmb they open at 4:30 the decor inside is super cute just like the ones you see on korean dramas"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a racist against white people I don't know how to use a chopstick and they won't provide any forks forks are better than chopstick in every single way 100 and million times better but there are a few refuse to provide me Forks because they are racist"}
{"text":"New fave Korean BBQ spot.  It's clear they put a lot of effort into the interior because it doesn't feel like Toronto once you're inside.  Portions are big and the price is just right."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! The portions were on the smaller side but the meat was a great quality. Their cheesy corn was excellent! Could eat a giant bowl of just that! The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice, it was modern and had it's own vibe."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, reminds of me kbbq in LA. Service was quick and efficient (they understood English just fine)The portions were a tad small so better to go in a bigger group so you can try all the meats. Refills on all the side dishes were good, even the corn and cheese! 

My only suggestion is, I wish there was better ventilation because it is quite smokey. 

Come early or else it is always packed!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good food. Liked all the meat and delicious side dishes. I'd come back. Very limited parking though."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but I stopped going there now. Wait time is sooooo long and its slightly pricey considering the meat portion and banchan quality. Still its a fun place esp for night outs with friends. I love how they gathered up so many stuffs that reflects Korea's old days."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend one evening, the restaurant was busy. The person at the front guided us to a waiting list where you can jot down your name and number, they will give you a number slip and you can wander around the area while you wait for them to call you when your table is ready. Once your table is ready, you hand them the number slip (so do not lose it, no big deal if you do).

Food: The spicy cold noodles were yummy, I forget why but they are not like your ordinary cold noodles. For meats, you have to order a minimum of two meats. The meats are grilled on a cast iron pan that has pockets of egg and cheesy corn mixture on either side. There is a side of kimchi there too and I suggest you put that on the side or the kimchi will get warm overtime. The cloves of garlic add a nice aroma so definitely use it when grilling your meat!

We got the pork belly and beef boneless short rib that came with a couple of dipping sauces. Both were good and melt in your mouth (not like butter though, perhaps we did not cook them to the right temperature). It would have been nice if the meat were marinated but that is just my preference. Side dishes came with the meat as well as a small basket of veggies to assemble your own lettuce wraps (ssambap).

This was my first experience eating grilled meat with cheese and it was not bad at all.

Service & atmosphere: There was a visible slick of oil/grease on one of the seats and the server kindly wiped it (not fully clean though) after we brought it to their attention. The floor is a bit slippery under the table, so walk in and out with caution. The staff there are friendly indeed.

Price: The price could be justified for the quality of the meat but it is a bit too much for the amount of meat (200 g), this price likely covers for the banchan and extras too."}
{"text":"This is a great Korean bbq place. It's not all you can eat but fills you up just as much and for cheaper! My total was under $20 including tips and tax for dinner whereas AYCE would have been closer to 30. We got the porkbelly, short ribs and beef for the meats and a seafood pancake to share. The quantities are good and it also comes with unlimited sides such as lettuce kimchi onions and more to eat with the meats. The only complaint was the lack of parking but there is a timmies plaza across the street where we were able to park for free. Also be warned your clothes will smell after. But over all it was a great experience definitely would recommend and come back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Korean grills I have ever had. The free corn and cheese is amazing but that and the egg is limited refills (The number of refills you get is the number of people at the table). All the most popular meat is really good. The service is better than most places and the place itself is very cute and wooden. Pricing is like any other authentic Korean grill. It's not going to be a cheap eat. The sake is very expensive. Also parking is a bit of a hassle - no parking in the front. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night, the place was PACKED.  We did not make a reservation (we will next time), and we waited in line for ~45min for a table of two.

The meats were priced by the plate (not AYCE), the reason why I took off a star for lack of value.  Our server initially forgot our order but he quickly recovered by offering us a free plate of meat on top of our order.  We get it, it was a very busy night.  The sides that came with the grill were a bonus - my fave was the cheesy corn.  We also ordered the kimchi pancake which was worth trying.

Overall I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the food was great, and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Must Try: Marinated beef, pork belly

Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (10/10) Value, (10/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  

Personally, my favourite non-all you can eat KBBQ in the city. This is because the taste and value meet at a perfect point, where you get delicious kbbq meat for a great price.

The setting is designed in a very traditional 'korean bar' style, with wood decorations and barrel chairs. It's not necessarily fancy, but it's a great atmosphere to go eat and drink with friends.

The menu has a solid variety of meat, all with aesthetic presentation. They also have unlimited corn and egg, amongst other side dishes, which adds to the amazing value of this restaurant. 

Service is always quick and attentive with the restaurant itself being clean. 

This place does get very busy, so there are usually wait times for seats during peak hours. But of all the places to wait for anything in Toronto, this is hands down the most worth it."}
{"text":"This place is poppin, and I understand why. 
I've had a lot of kbbq in Toronto however, i've never had one where they had the egg, cheese & corn, and kimchi surrounding the grill, I thought that this was very unique. The whole experience felt really authentic and the server... A+++ TO YOU. He's the best. Super friendly staff who works quickly.
The pork belly was very thick cut and was very fresh and delicious.
The restaurant itself looks very authentic and street style feel."}
{"text":"90s theme Korean BBQ restaurant, wooden layout, atmosphere is quite romantic. Seats great as a date or as a party up to 6. Love the appetizers and grilled platter! 

Typical authentic kbbq restaurant with the wrapped pork belly in lettuce and condiments. Kimchi pancake, kimchi stew, pork belly, fed 5 of us nicely.

***WARNING! The hot oil starts splattering everywhere WARNING!***
(Wear a long sleeve)"}
{"text":"Great place for pork and beef!

Came on Sunday at 6pm, no line up and we were seated in the patio area in the back. I would suggest the patio on a nice day as it isn't as stuffy and dark as the main restaurant area.

The staff were super attentive at first and less so when it because very busy (around 7/8pm). Staff proactively refilled side dishes and offered more even when some sides were not yet finished. Even during busy period service was acceptable and the staff always had great attitude.

We ordered pork jowl meat, beef rib eye roll and beef rib finger meat for two of us. Don't underestimate 200g of meat! 200g = 7oz of meat, which essentially is a good portion of meat per person. One portion of meat is likely enough for one person as there are a ton of sides to also snack on. we got unlimited sides, no question asked. We even got a refill of cheese corn and egg (not sure if it is limited as we only asked once). Rice is an additional $2 a bowl and it is purple rice, which was a nice surprise.

Total bill came to around $66 for two of us after taxes before tips. Pretty reasonable price considering we mainly ate meat and side dishes.

Leaving at 8pm, there was a line-up inside the restaurant and around 10 people waiting outside. They only take reservations Mon-Thurs so be early if you decide to dine on a weekend!

Fullness level: 10/10. Super full, remember side dishes are pretty much unlimited! (even BF agreed 3 portions of meat was too much)
Price vs. Satisfaction: 9/10.  $33/person for fresh meat and unlimited marinated veggies? That's a yes for me! Also, it probably could've been cheaper. Did I mention we ordered too much?? (we were also starving before this)
Atmosphere: 7/10. I really liked the patio (20 degrees and sunny outside, but I would have found it stuffy were I inside the actual restaurant)
Food Quality: 9/10. Great food! BF loved the free soup but the eggs kind of burnt since we left it there too long... but nothing we could've done.
Service: 9.5/10. Super proactive staff when not busy, but at least you can easily flag them down when it gets busy. Also, great attitude.

Definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"Located in one of the many strip malls in the Yonge and Finch area, Daldongnae is the newest addition in terms of KBBQ. Parking is hard to find considering there are only a handful of spots. 

Food (3.5/5)
Like most restaurants there is a minimum of two orders for the meat selections. We got the pork belly and hanger steak which were recommended to us. We were fairly surprised at the portions when the food arrived considering there were very few pieces of meat. Aside from the meat, the grill is surrounded by eggs, cheesy corn and kimchi that cooks along with the meat. The eggs are slow cooked in a broth mixture which added depth to the flavor. The cheesy corn was deliciously sweet and savoury but unfortunately can only be refilled once. The grilled meat was good but the steak was a bit tough.

Service (3/5)
Service was nothing to write home about. There were enough servers to cover the tables but it still took a few times of asking to get our requests fulfilled. 

Overall the restaurant had a great vibe and was decorated like an old school place. Food was good but not worth the price tag. For KBBQ cravings you're better off going to a family restaurant for more food portions and additional sides."}
{"text":"6 stars! Highly recommend!!!
Their side dishes are the best in town and service can't get better , they never ever act uncomfortable anytime I ask for more banchan (apple-potato salad is my favorite). Quality of meat never disappoints, though price is a bit expensive, for me it's totally worth. Have been going there every month."}
{"text":"Amazing kbbq spot uptown with quality meats. Love how they provide cheese on the skillet. A bit pricey but extremely worth it! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tip: come before 6:30 for a shorter wait time! Arrived around 6:25 and my friend came early around 6:15 so we didn't wait for a table. 

Ordered three meats, two rice, and one seafood pancake and it came to around $21 + tip each person!! I don't eat a lot so it was a good deal! I love how it comes with so many side dishes. See all of the ones in the picture including a soup type dish! The cheese wasn't really enough but it's a nice addition to the corn. The decor is also super pretty! I love the bench and table styles they have! I wouldn't come again unless whoever I was eating with wanted to but I would definitely recommend to try at least once!"}
{"text":"You walk in and you're automatically reminded of those KBBQ restaurants you see in Korean dramas, which got me hella excited when I first came here. You've got those bar stools where you can store your jacket and bags in and the grill that comes with egg, cheese & corn, Kimchi and garlic on the sides. 

The presentation of the food and the interior is definitely very impressive, but I feel as though the portioning of the meat isn't as worth it for its price. It's a good balance if you add some carbs in there which my girlfriends and I did by getting a cheese and kimchi Korean pancake. Also, unlike most places I've been to, there's an extra $2 charge if you want a bowl of rice. 

Despite the portioning, the cut of the meat is thicc and it's super fresh which is an important factor to consider when eating at a KBBQ joint. In addition, there's free refills on the side dishes and the sides that come on the grill - so it acts as a good filler. I love the onion slaw and soybean paste that you can put into your lettuce wrap with the meat, and the soybean soup to wash everything down. 

Also they got that green grape soju. Enough said.

Tl;dr - it gives off the authentic Korean bbq vibe and you have to try the green grape soju if you have not."}
{"text":"There's nothing like eating meat off of a piece of wood. Make your carnivore fantasies come true at this place, which I didn't know KBBQ places actually existed north of YnF. 

A bit on the pricey side, back when being in school would make me squeal at the prices presented in front of me. What really caught my eye was the MOAT OF EGG AND CHEESE AND VEGGIES MELTING AROUND THE STOVETOP. Dip your pork and beef in MELTED CHEESE. Nothing beats that combo. You have to come here just to see this alone. More of a cool feature to experience than to taste. 

Beef was 28$~ for a two servings of their higher cut. Pork belly low 20$'s. Would come here to see the smiles on my friends faces that have never experience egg and cheese around a grill before"}
{"text":"Came to this place after seeing the great reviews, inside decor looks really cosy and with pretty awesome ambience. 

Came here at 6pm on a Tuesday night and the place was already pretty full, the square tables along the wall were all taken already. The round tables in the middle has the same storage stools as other Korean BBQ places that has the removable top cushion to store your bags in, 

We ordered the pork belly and the beef stripsbas recommender by our waiter, the meat was very tenderous and juicy, 

The meat orders for BBQ are all Minimum 2 orders per item, however they do allow mix and match of different meat types which was great. Some korean BBQ places doesn't allow that which can get quite annoying since it can lead to excessive amt of meat ordered.

One thing to note is the grill cooks really fast , and the meats may tend to be overcooked if left on it for too long, highly suggest turning the heat level down to medium or lower to avoid overcooking the meat ( esp the beef strips)

The wait staff was extremely friendly and very attentive.  They had even refilled the creamy corn and the scrambled eggs several times, which was not usually seen in other places.

Was a really nice dining experience, would def  come back again!"}
{"text":"Just back from my trip to Korea where I ate authentic high quality BBQ with my native relatives , and this place is pretty legit.

My wife and I ordered the Pork Jowl, Beef Rib and Beef Chucks. We also had a side of the Tofu and Kimchi (which includes pork meat!)

Pork Jowls were marinated with what tasted like light rosemary, but it wasnt overpowering.

Our favs were the jowls and chucks, the most expensive was the rib, and while it was good, you can satisfy your beef craving with the chucks at a much cheaper cost.

The tofu kimchi was a great side instead of rice (which isn't included) and was not too heavy at all. You can take the leftovers home and make a nice kimchi stew if you like ;).

Overall the interior design, the customer service and the food were impressive for sure.

Parking may be an issue so make sure to reserve and scope the area early. They do not take reservations on the weekend however!

Protips:

1) finish the potato side dish quickly or place the jalapenos on top of thr cooking garlic so you can spoon out the egg and corn onto a plate! - or just ask for another plate haha.  this will ensure your egg doesn't overcook and that you wont burn yourself trying to eat too quickly!

2) if you order pork and beef, cook the pork first then put the onions and meat ontop of the pork oils for extra flavor!

3) order at most 2 meat dishes at a time, since the grill is a bit smaller and you'll keep your meat fresher that way!

Hope you enjoy like I did!

**Sauces were not too salty, or too sweet or too little, only refill we needed was the lettuce.**"}
{"text":"Location/Service
Along Yonge street, north of Cummer. There's parking behind the restaurant and also street parking available. 

Very nice decor, it has a lot of old Korean furniture on display and brings out a street style KBBQ style to it - bringing that local authenticity. 

Staff were very nice and friendly. The person serving us I think was the owner, approachable and explains the menu/items really well


Food
This is not AYCE KBBQ, so do watch how much you want to eat. The meat items are minimum order of 2 portions, but you can mix and match. 

I was eating with a party of 4 and we order the classic Pork Belly, Beef Rib Finger Meet and Pork Shoulder Butt. 

You grill the meat yourself and it's placed on a stove that also has cheese corn, egg, kimchi and garlic surrounding the plate. These along with the lettuce wraps and appetizers can be refilled. All the meats we've tasted were excellent. High in quality, chewy and bursting with flavor. And you can eat in any style you want - whether it's wrapped up or dipped in their sauces provided. Each person has their own dipping plate, so it's easier to manage. Note the grilling plate heats up pretty quickly and the oil from the meat might splashing around, be cautious not to hurt yourself!

Also tried the kimchi cheese pancake. Typical must order side dish, batter is mixed well with kimchi (a little spicy) and topped off with a layer of cheese. 


Overall I really like this place. It's a little small but they do take reservations. It's perfect if you're with a few friends or family."}
{"text":"Cute and authentic Korean BBQ! The interior is reminiscent of the KBBQ places in South Korea. Restaurant is on the smaller side so expect a bit of a wait! They don't take reservations during prime dinner time on Fridays/Saturdays. When you enter just write your name and phone number in the booklet. We probably waited around 45 minutes for our table for two on Friday night.

What's unique about Daldongnae is the selection of side dishes they offer. On top of the usual kimchi, seaweed, and lettuce salad there is also a steamed egg soup and best of all corn cheese!! Although I wish the corn cheese was cheesier.

There's a minimum order of two meat items - we got the beef boneless short rib and beef chuck flap tail. Both were decent. The dips for the meat were amazing though - salted sesame dip (my fave - I would come back just for this), spicy dip, and onion dip. All orders come with a tofu stew and we ordered rice on the side.

Definitely a good KBBQ spot to check out. Both food and service were on point."}
{"text":"Well what can I say, the service is not as good as I think, you need to ask the staff at least two times to get what u want. Food is just so so. The design of the comal is a disaster. Oil just split onto you after cooking..."}
{"text":"This is a new Korean BBQ joint. They did a special decoration to make it look like a restaurant from from 80s. We tried Pork belly and Rib eye. We loved Pork belly and it paired wonderfully with shots of Soju. The quality of Rib eye was a disappointment though. I guess I shouldn't expect a good quality of meat at such price point. The BBQ grill comes with corn cheese, kimchi and eggs. If you are looking for something different this is a great place. You can also store your coat inside the chair."}
{"text":"I like this place since the establishment was really cleaned.  The bbq meat smell was really intoxicating with a traditional style f Korean design with a lot of wooden seats and stylized to resemble nature.  

The food was really good with fresh good quality meat.  It was too bad that one of my friends do not eat beef.  I really wanted to try the beef, but that will be next time.  At the end, we ordered the pork belly and pork jowl meat, they were both quite fresh and tasty.  We also ordered the tofu kimchi soup.  The soup was really spicy, maybe a little too spicy for my taste.   The side dishes were excellent with thr pumkin potatoe egg salad being my favourite.  

The servers are polite, but not very attentive.  Since it was really busy at the restaurant today, it took a while for us to get service.  Since we ordered several soju, the price was a little hefty for my liking.  Overall, it was a good place to go, but not somewhere I would go back soon due to the price and the service."}
{"text":"Must go to Korean barbeque spots in Toronto! The meat is high quality and portions are just right. The atmosphere is very lively and great for a small group of friends. Also recommended just to come for a snack and drinks!"}
{"text":"Great spot for Korean bbq! Service is delightful and always prepared. There is plenty of seats available but this location is very popular so try to come a little earlier or else you may have to wait a long time for a spot. 

This spot also surrounds your grill with cheese & corn, kimchi, egg, and garlic which heat up while you're cooking.

If you've ever watched a Korean drama and seen the characters eating at a KBBQ restaurant, this location will definitely remind you of those scenes!"}
{"text":"food was great and service was average. loved the cheese with corn so yummy!!! our bill came out around $40 for two which was not bad for bbq."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere, but the food didn't meet my expectations. We tried 2 types of beef - the steak and ribs..both were as good compared to other places we've tried. Maybe their pork is better? The steamed egg and corn around the bbq grill was really good though. A fun place for friends to meet up and chill"}
{"text":"Awesome KBBQ joint, friendly staff, good food, good drink options. KBBQ has corn/cheese and egg on the side of the grills and can be refilled. Pancakes here are mediocre I'd stay away.

Try the egg rolls too, can't go wrong with those."}
{"text":"A great place for Korean BBQ. Waited for a little bite and was seated in less than 15 min. I ordered beef short ribs ($25.99) and pork belly ($15.99). The short ribs were on point with marbles and the pork belly was delicious as well. The meats were very fresh. You can cook the meats to your own preference. 
Also ordered Oden Soup, not as good as expected. The flavor was bland. Not recommended. And it was $14.99, totally not worth it. 
The meal also comes with a few side dishes ( lettuce, seaweed, potatoes salad and fermented cucumbers), they have unlimited refills, but I thought the side dishes were a bit too salty, especially the soup that came with the BBQ. 
My favorite part of the dinner was the cheese corn and the eggs. It can be refilled at anytime. The cheese corn was fun to play with and delicious.  
The restaurant has a very unique layout as well. I prefer sitting at seats that are against the wall, because sitting at the tables in the middle of the restaurant was very awkward in my opinion, especially going with a party of 2. 
This is not a great place for a meat feast if you have a budget. But it does have quality food and services. Great experience!!! 
One thing I don't like is the after-smell. The smokey-BBQ smell will get into your clothing and hair."}
{"text":"I would have given a 5 star but since they only allow walk-in's despite it being so busy, I'm making this a 4 star. I came here on a snow storm friday night along with 4 friends and waited for over 45 mins. We got seated at the back side of the restaurant. It looked like an extension of the restaurant hence no alcohol could be served on this side. If you want to order alcohol, make sure you get seated in the main dining area.

Food was excellent. Fresh and tender marbled meat of all sorts. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Price varies from $15-$25 depending on the cuts with a minimum order of two types of meat per order. With the grill items, they also came with soup, lettuce, egg, cheesy corn, kimchi and garlic. I just love the fact that all the sides are refillable! Their seafood pancake was also great and filling. 

Environment: Loud, lively and packed. Great place with friends to hang out and drink. Not suitable for toddlers. Seats could be slightly uncomfortable because you're on a stool. However, it was smart that you could store your coats and bags inside the stool to prevent them from smelling like Korean BBQ. 

I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. There was a wait but it wasnt too long and there are limited seats to sit on while waiting. I liked that they had a decent waiting area in comparison to some places where your forced to be in between doors or standing outside! You get questioned if you plan on drinking or not so theres different areas for seating. 

We weren't planning on drinking so we sat on the outer part beside the door which had to be opened a couple of times but they were apologetic. I liked the seating options as it allows you to store our jacket and purse underneath away from the KRN BBQ smell and oil splatter! The loved the concept of the restaurant, it different from your typical.. it felt like you were in another country? The decor is very rustic and vintage with some old and new. 

The menu was decent and wasn't overwhelming, basic but with options. I liked the refillable side dishes! Im all about the side dishes ad I feel it offsets all the meat you devour. The kimchi cucumbers, potato salad, cheese corn and egg was great. We had the pork belly and the beef (forget what it was called) the meat is not marinated to what you would expect from other AYCE krn bbq joints it was either no marinate or very basic I.e sesame oil but I didnt mind because there was dipping options on table.

Overall great atmosphere, good food, decent service, reasonable price."}
{"text":"Delicious korean bbq with great quality meat! I came here with friends who go often and always rave about this place and it didn't disappoint. There is definitely a long wait for a table so come early and expect to wait. 

The service is very friendly. Especially from the guy who seemed to be the manager. Between 4 of us, we ordered the pork jowl, boneless short rib, beef rib finger meat, and some other beef (I didn't order so I don't remember, but it was all delicious). We were so busy stuffing our faces and quickly cooking the meat that we didn't realize we had received pork belly rather than the jowl until after we cooked one piece and cut it all up. The manager kindly brought us the jowl without charging for the pork belly :)

The quality of the beef and pork were way better than most korean bbq places. The onion sauce that they give you is sweet and vinegary and it goes so well with the beef. I love that you get unlimited egg and cheese corn poured into your pan. I thoroughly enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Pretty damn awesome. I ate there for two hours unexpectedly! 

I went there around 7 waited for a few minutes to be seated since it was packed! Sitting down we ordered the pork belly and the beef short right away. It was a small Korean restaurant that made it feel super authentic to the ones I went in Korea. 

The food came quick as expected since it is raw. The BBQ plate had kimchi, egg, garlic and sweet cheese corn. The heat was great, it roasted Thera at a decent pace not too fast and not too slow. Accompanied by an assortment of side dishes for garnishing made the experience truly better. Lettuce in vinegar, onion in spice to name a few. Of course the lettuce wraps too! 

On the side we ordered a cold noodle which was great! Cold and refreshing alternative to our heavy meat feast. The noodles has various vegetable and the famous gochujang (spicy sauce) for mixing! 

Overall best Kbbq I have been yet!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and I would bring my non-Korean friends there for it.
Food/price okay
Atmosphere good
Waiting time not good
Service okay"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!

Meat was very fresh! Although the meat servings weren't the biggest there were many included side dishes that were filling.

All in all for the price and quality of the food I would recommend going to Daldongnae."}
{"text":"Authentic korean bbq. Unlimited refills of my fav cheese and corn. Egg and all beginning small appetizers are refillable as well. Love the atmosphere of this korean bbq restaurant- rustic and cozy. Reminder : you will stink after you eat here. Great place with friends - will have tons of fun eating , grilling and drinking. Delicious food as well! Would definitely come back time after time!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I have been CRAVING kbbq for a good 6 months. The only problem is, the town we currently live in (Currently NYS) doesn't have any type of Korean bbq at all. We travel far just to eat. One of the main reasons we came to Toronto was for the food scene. Anyways now that you know the back story, maybe you'll figure why this review is only meh.

This was our last day in Toronto, we saved this spot for our last dinner here. So I was kinda disappointed when It wasn't satisfying. I'm sad thinking about it lol. We're originally from Southern California, where we have tons of AYCE kbbq. This place was none like the ones back home. That's not necessarily a bad thing though. I feel like this is maybe more of a traditional style? I expected there to be a lot more different meats. It was also pretty pricey for the portion you get. The cuts of meat were nice but the flavors, idk I expected It to stand out more. I wish There was a marinated option as well. I don't like just the taste of beef. But It became one note pretty quickly. Even with all of the sides. I really liked that we had the steamed egg and corn cheese around the grill though. That was probably my favorite part. 

The atmosphere and ambiance is really nice. It's super cute and makes you feel like you're in a corner of Korea. It just wasn't what I expected."}
{"text":"Came here with reservations for a group of 6 and were promptly seated. We ordered a variety of meats to share, including pork belly, pork shoulder butt, beef boneless short rib, beef rib finger meat, and ribeye roll. The meats were all fresh and delicious except for the beef rib finger meat, which was a bit tough. I think everyone's favorite was the egg and cheese corn that is steamed on the grill. Service was great in giving us multiple refills on those!"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and got the craving for some K BBQ. After a lil stroll along Korea town we picked the place cause of superb exterior of the building. Pretty much you standard K BBQ except real fresh cuts of meats price was a lil high but nothing to bad . Overall really good"}
{"text":"The ambiance is amazing! I feel like I am at Seoul. The steamed egg on the side is unlimited refills. 
The first few times were really good, then it got a bit salty.

The corn with mayonnaise is tasty. The quality of the beef is excellent.

I really like how the rims appetizer were unlimited refills. Service is good, they came back a few times to see if we need anything. 

The Jinro green grape soju was really good. 

Ambiance is good except for the pot lights, we have to ask them to dim it.

I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant- service was prompt, good was good! We ordered the pork Jowl and pork belly for two people. The meat was fatty and tastes really good. The side dishes included mashed potatoes, kelp, cucumber and were all very tasty. The downside is that the restaurant lighting is quite dim and the menu print was not very dark so it was a little difficult to read. Otherwise it was a good meal, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Really great Korean BBQ joint in the city. As others have said, the ambience is great and feels very authentic. The amount of food we got for the amount of money we paid was worth it - between 6 people we ordered three pork cuts, three beef cuts, a seafood pancake and a miso tofu soup. They also served us tons of banchan and refilled our cheese corn and egg multiple times. And we got two bottles of soju. This all came out to $35 per person including tax and tip. Service was on point.

-1 star because we had a reservation for 9 p.m. but weren't seated until 9:40. Admittedly we were a group of 11 and the manager did come and tell us that the group before us had stayed longer than anticipated, but a 40 minute wait even when we had a reservation was frustrating. Tip for big groups: try booking a couple weeks in advance for an earlier time slot!"}
{"text":"Servants are friendly, helpful, and fast. This place is super busy on Friday and Saturday, but the servants are still very patient to answer our questions about the menu. 

Good quality of meat, .... pricy.  200g (about a hand palm size steak) beef eye roll costs $18.99 before tax. 

Note this is the price for a slide of RAW beef, not marinated, not cut, nothing. The side dishes on the bbq plate add some value, but still, we felt it's not worth the price. 

A huge plate of beef eye roll from costco is only about $30

A cooked steak combo in Keg is only about $30- 35

We guess a lot of people give high rate because of the atmosphere, very traditional Korean style.  However, My friend and I both feel being ripped off."}
{"text":"Came here for my bday dinner with friends last week Sunday. They take resos everyday except for Saturday, and only before 6:30pm on Sundays (and Fridays?). Make sure you make resos - there was a decently long line going out the main doors the whole night.

So you sit down and BAM, before you know it, your server hands you a menu with 8 different meat options. We asked the nice dude (not sure if manager or owner?), and he recommended 1 and 4 of the pork and 1 and 4 of the beef, I believe. We ended up ordering 12 servings of various meats for 9 ppl. They were all delicious - especially when you wrap them with the leaf, rice, garlic, sauce, onions, etc. Heaven in your mouth.

Then you get the side dishes, cheese corn, and egg. Once again, heaven in your mouth. ***one thing to note*** apparently the cheese corn and egg are now limited - probably because ppl kept abusing it. gg get rekt. I just wish they let us know that beforehand, because we came in with the expectation that they were unlimited.

Another thing to mention was the excellent service we received. First, all of the servers were nice and very quick to refill any of the million side dishes. Second, my gf brought a birthday cake, and not only did they not charge a cutting fee, they put it in their fridge and then when it was time, they brought it out with a knife, spoons, and plates. So very nice of them.

Exceptional KBBQ. My friends spammed the group chat the next day, reminiscing about our feast at Daldongnae. The price was really good too - for 12 portions for 9 ppl and a bottle of rice wine, each person paid around $30.

So please, ppl of Yelp, do not abuse their generosity. Let's keep Daldongae a sacred place to feast on delicious food."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a tuesday night with my boyfriend. Food was good , only complaint is the price for the meat....way toooooo expensive considering it is just pork belly and you won't be full off the amount they gave you. For people who are driving, keep in mind that the parking spot is about four spaces ? And really small"}
{"text":"Super delicious korean bbq restaurant. This place gets really busy and for good reason. They don't have much parking but you can park across in the Tim Hortons plaza and walk across. I ordered the pork belly, the beef fingerling, and the ribeye. What I like best about this place is the variety of food. With your meat order, you get: garlic, jalapeños, onions in soy sauce, corn with cheese, egg, lettuce, soup, and your regular banchan. Plus the stools act as storage so you can put your jacket in there if you don't want it to smell. The service is really quick and friendly. My only con would be the washrooms that were located downstairs, they were pretty dirty and there's only one."}
{"text":"Good Korean BBQ. No reservation will be taken on Saturday so we went here at 5. There's plenty of seats and we could see theres a line up starting at 6. 
This place is extremely bad with air ventilation. The smoke is basically burning your eyes. The worst air ventilation place I've ever been. 

Side dishes and lettuce are all you can eat. Corn with cheese is per head count. Meat is decent, nothing special."}
{"text":"One of the popular Korean BBQ hotpots in North York. It's quite the busy hotspot here as they don't usually take reservations and wait times can be between 30 minutes up to an hour. Everyone seems to be craving meat wrapped with the cheesy corn goodness. It's also a very small restaurant so it doesn't really help matters. On the menu, they have 2 kinds of meat to choose from: beef or pork. I went with a group of 4 friends and we decided to order 2 from each meat. We ordered the pork belly- which is a must, pork skirt meat, beef rib eye roll and beef hanging tender. They bring you a platter of the uncooked meat along with the BBQ grill which has the cheesy corn, kimchi, egg and garlic. The service was a bit shaky as the server took a long time to get our order and the restaurant was very busy. The food came quickly and we put the different meats on the grill. They also brought us some small appetizers to start. I thought the meats were quite delicious when wrapped with the corn cheese. It also takes good when you wrapped the meat and corned cheese in the lettuce wraps they give you. There is no time limit so we took our time cooking the meats. I would allow allocate about 2 hours to dine here to really enjoy the experience here. The good part is they provide unlimited refills on the toppings.  Service was good, ambience is great and food was delicious. Overall, a nice enjoyable dinner experience as I thoroughly enjoy the food, ambience and great company."}
{"text":"Pros: 
- Excellent food. The meats were super fresh (since they were red) and everything was just delicious overall.

- Staff were friendly and knowledgeable, especially the manager. He helped recommend which sauces went better with which meats (which helped enhance our experience here). 

- The ambiance and interior made me feel like I was eating in Seoul. 

- I really liked their chairs - I like how you can store your coats and bags inside of the chairs! Every restaurant (especially ramen shops and bars) should have these. 

Cons:

- You had to choose two types of meats and prices started at around $15 (pork) and $19 (beef). Despite the fact that food is a bit pricey, the price is worth it - the meats are all super fresh, and you get a generous amount of side dishes, fillings, condiments, etc."}
{"text":"The food was great, they even give you complimentary soup and eggs in a clay pot if you are doing a BBQ but I would say that some of the two seater tables are quite too small to fit everything you order."}
{"text":"It's yummy but also slightly intimidating, very confusing and pricey. 

My boyfriend and I were planning to get korean bbq at kookminghagyo but the line up was way too long so we decided to give this place a try. They opened not long ago but the place was already packed and we were the only non korean party in the restaurant. 

Having never had authentic korean bbq, we weren't sure of how everything works but we were never really explained anything. Taking a shot in the dark, we decided to go with two portions of pork meat: the jowl and the butt (200g each). The stove came with sides of kimchi, buttery cheesy corn and egg (we had no idea what you had to do with the egg...) and we also got a few side dishes: some pickles, something that looked like mashed potato, more vegetables, carrot sticks (once again, no clue on how everything is supposed to work). 

200g turned out to be very little meat, we got two pork chop sized slices for the pork butt and roughly 15 small stripes for the jowl. It was definitely not enough for the two of us. Towards the end of meal, they brought us a soybean soup which was way too spicy for us (we have a pretty high tolerance for spicy).

Overall, it was such a confusing dinner and we both left hungry. We really wish that we were given more instructions on how everything works and how much to order."}
{"text":"First Impressions
=============
Cozy, cool vibe, and lively.  Host was friendly and welcoming.

Service
======
Great service.  Friendly and courteous, and they checked up on us a couple tomes to see if everything was good.

Food
====
Ordered the beef short rib, pork belly and kimchi pancake.

Beef short Rib
- Yummy.  It's the same short rib you can buy from Galleria (the premium ones that are nicely marbled).
- Served raw, you cook and choose your dipping sauce.

Pork belly
- The cut was thick, and the strips were cross cut on the surface (like a hot dog) for faster cooking--which was good.
- The meat again was great and something I think you can also buy at Galleria.
- Served raw, you cook it and choose dipping sauce.  You can also wrap this one in a lettuce wrap along with some garlic.  
- Delicious!

Kimchi Pancake
- Good Pancake, nothing extra ordinary, just a good solid Pancake.

Overall
- Food was good, price was reasonable, atmosphere was lively and definitely an experience worth trying.
- The grill was interesting the fat from the belly and beef drips to the tray where Kimchi and Raw garlic is stored.  A  few pork bellies later and you have some nice fried kimchi and garlic ^_^.

Would I come back?
===============
Yes! There's no one killer dish that would make me want to come back, but the whole experience of the restaurant, will definitely be calling me.

In other words I have a feeling that I'm going to crave to come back one day, but not for any particular dish, just knowing that what ever I order is going to be good and I'm in for a good time!"}
{"text":"Good quality meats, charming service, and cutesy atmosphere but a bit over-priced and under-portioned. You can get just as good quality cuts for a lot more at Piggy's if you want a more hearty kbbq dinner."}
{"text":"I liked Daldongnae because it was different from other Korean bbqs I've been to. The decoration and atmosphere as well as how they served the food was pretty cool. They mainly only have meats (beef and pork) on their menu and they will bring you sides such as soup, kimchi, corn, egg etc. as you order meats. The bbq plates have these side bowls that they pour egg and corn (mixed with cheese) in them which they cook as you bbq the meat. They have a wide variety of meat cuts and we tried most of them. I think the food is a bit overpriced compared to the other Korean place but it is high quality. The service was great and the staff was super friendly.

Food: 4/5
Price: 3.5/5
Service and atmosphere: 4.5/5
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Unlike other Korean bbq place, this one has the best ambiance! They use a lot of antique as their decor. The service is awesome and quick. The store manager was very helpful and and friendly. The food quality was good too! Definitely will come back again. Sometimes the line is a little long but it worths the long wait."}
{"text":"New favourite spot for kbbq! Especially with their pot that comes with cheese and corn, egg, kimchi and garlic. We tried their pork belly and beef and we are definitely coming back to try it again soon!"}
{"text":"Daldongnae is great. My friends and I went last week and we can't wait to go back soon!

There were four of us, so we ordered 4 different types of meat: Pork Jowl, Pork Belly, Ribeye, and Beef Short Plate. Yum! Everything was soo good, photogenic, and pretty reasonably priced! The atmosphere was very cozy and really relaxed, really reminded our group of a nice winter night in a cabin with great friends.

The ring around the grill was filled with egg, corn and cheese, kimchi, and raw garlic slices. As you cook your meat, the fat drips into these pockets, cooks the garlic, and makes it extra yummy (drool!). They gave us plenty of (refillable!) sides, lettuce, and raw hot pepper. We were all full by the end of the meal. 

In addition to food, we also got one bottle of soju (about 2 shots per person) and the total came up to around $25 per person plus tip. The staff was super nice and very helpful. BUT I think the manager said that they don't do split bills on Fri/Sat, but they helped us with that anyways because we looked so helpless and it wasn't too busy by the time we asked for our bills (sorry for the inconvenience!). Like I said, can't wait to go back! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I think I found my new go-to place for korean BBQ! I love Daldongnae. Food and service is great!

This restaurant is packed and they do not take reservations. So try to come earlier or later in the evening to avoid peak dinner hours. 

The atmosphere is casual and they have interesting cute decor. The menu is quite simple, it is divided into pork and beef meats. Then there are appetizers. 

Me and my friend decided to try three different kinds of cuts here. We ordered the pork jowl meat, pork skirt meat, and the beef rib eye. We were surprised there were so many side dishes! I love the cheese
& corn, and the egg that they have around the grill. This makes this restaurant different from other korean bbq joints around. 

Food:
Pork jowl-this is my favorite cut whenever I have korean bbq so I'm biased towards liking this already. The meat was fatty and tender.

Pork skirt meat-I loved this. It was good quality and well marinated. 

Beef rib eye-this was actually my least favorite. It wasn't bad but I prefer the pork cuts more. 

Service: the service wasn't attentive since they were so busy. You would have to wave them down for service. They were very friendly at all times though which is great. 

I really like this restaurant and I think it is now my go-to for korean BBQ whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE & ADORE this place! For Toronto, I think this place is about as close as it get to authentic Korean style BBQ. The service is impeccable, and everyone is just so happy to give refills on the sides. Their meat quality is excellent, and prices are reasonable. The unique offer is unlimited refills on their cheese corn & egg. I've been here twice, this year, and will definitely be back for more. Must order their hanging beef, spicy cold noodles, seafood pancake and pork belly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Daldongnae after hearing many good reviews! The interior is decorated like Korean olden days - lots of old school cameras, newspaper articles, advertisements and pictures. We were seated at a booth and it was pretty comfortable! I was surprised at the ventilation of the place, it wasn't burning hot like some KBBQ restaurants. Service was excellent. 

* MEAT CHOICES:
BEEF BONELESS SHORT RIBS & BEEF CHUCK FLAP TAIL (4/5)
This was so gooodd!! I loved the kalbi - and it's even better because it's boneless!

*  KIMCHI COLD NOODLE SOUP (5/5)
The cold noodle soup was amazingly delicious!! I'd highly recommend this cold noodle soup with your meal if you're ordering something spicy. It was fresh and light. I'd definitely order this again!

Side dishes includes: mashed potato scoop, spicy seaweed, spicy cucumbers, kimchi & spicy salad. We also got a spicy tofu bean paste soup, which I really enjoyed. The KBBQ plate comes with garlic pieces, eggs, corn and cheese. Lettuce also comes on the side. 

I'd definitely return to try other meats on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Been here twice already and I'm sure I'll be back again. It's one of my favourite Korean bbq places and for many reasons. The old school decor takes you back in time to Korea. The seating is a mix of open booths and round tables with stools that open to store your belongings. There is an enclosed outdoor addition to the restaurant at the back. They'll usually ask if you'll be drinking since drinking is only allowed in the main section of the restaurant. 
Now on to the food. For meat selections, they offer quality cuts of beef and pork. There are other dishes as well such as kimchi pancakes, spicy cold noodles, spicy squid....   The bbq plate comes with a ring of egg, kimchi and corn + cheese. They also provide a basket of lettuce to wrap the meat and bunch of side dishes that you can refill at anytime. I guarantee you'll leave feeling extremely satisfied and full so recommend wearing comfortable clothing. Shoutout to their amazing service. The waiters/waitresses were all very friendly and would always ask if any refills are needed. 
I would say expect to spend $20+ per person. It's definitely great value for the amount of food you're given. The only downside would be the wait time which varies but I always had to wait for dinner. 
Overall great atmosphere, food, service and soju. 
Come hungry and leave happy :)."}
{"text":"There's no such place like this in Toronto right now. I like how they have BBQ in the middle and surrounding is corn cheese and egg. Those appetizers are refillable. Is so good. They have lots more of different kind of meats. Mostly other Korean BBQ restaurant only have ribs and pork belly, but this place have lots more. I do recommend you to go! ^^"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, such a fun and unique dining experience! Tons of new tries and specialties from the decor to the food and dining style. 

The decor is cozy and \"olden days-style\" Korean - what I would imagine to be an authentic Korean restaurant with wood booths and metal round tables in the middle. 

Min. order of 2, so for 2 people, we had the beef short ribs (slices) and the beef rib eye roll (steak). This comes with sides (spicy lettuce, seaweed, mashed sweet potato+ pumpkin, radish), lettuce for wrapping the meat, mushroom, onion and soybean soup. The grill itself also has kimchi (v. spicy!), garlic, egg and chewy cheesy corn. I loved the egg (kind of like steamed egg once it cooks) and the corn!! 

Unfortunately, what should've been the stars of the meal were disappointing (so I'll have to deduct 1 star). The rib eye steak (a thick large piece, can cut up with scissors) was extremely tough!! Not sure if we didn't know how to cook it properly, but it was extremely difficult to chew, my jaw was tired & hurt afterwards. The short rib was slightly better but still not super-soft, and also has little flavour so gotta use those delicious dipping sauces + onions!!

We also ordered the beef tartare. This was my first time having Korean style and it was amazing - strips of raw beef mixed with egg yolk, sesame oil and Asian pear - what a surprise combination! Be warned it is an extremely large portion - as the server said, \"big but very delicious\" I would say good for 4+ people.

Overall came to ~$80 for the 3 items. This is my type of Korean BBQ since I'm not a big eater; very happy about this new experience!"}
{"text":"Lovely k-bbq spot with cute decor and booths, it served as a great place for me to introduce k-bbq to my friends. Tried pork shoulder and rib eye, the meat was fresh and delicious but the side dishes weren't that amazing compared to other korean restaurants and the soy bean soup was a bit salty. But they give you some corns and eggs on the pan, which is pretty awesome! The location and parking isn't the most convenient but good service, price, and food. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Came here with a small group for some food and drinks on a weeknight, though it was also holiday season, so there was about a 40 min wait.

They have a lot of meat options here for the BBQ though some things are better than others. My favourite was the pork belly. The grill is quite cool cause it comes with egg, cheesy corn, garlic and kimchi that come on the side. And it cooks on the outer rim as the meat grills.

We ate a lot and we drank a lot, had a lot of fun here with my friends and service was great. We tried to sample all the different soju flavours. Price was reasonable. We all agreed it would be a good place to come back."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of my faves. We arrived at 12am and they close 2:30am. Hours are perfect for late nights. Incredible service as well. Food is delicious as always!"}
{"text":"I really liked their meat and appetizers!!  Spper cute environment. Only downfall would be the wait time- but for good food it was worth !! Probably not the best for a huge group- since there's limited seating, but best when it's just a group of 2-4 people."}
{"text":"My first impression was like, \"wow! Looks those those Korean Restaurant from those kdrama!\" So I super love the decor and the ambiance, the light was dim and was cozy inside, tables size was reasonable until u over order lol!. 

I came here with a group of five, their chair were quite interesting, it can open for u to store ur personal belongings, very thoughtful. Staff were very friendly and the location seems to be very busy.

My order consist of menu set of pork belly and beef, additionAlly we also ordered the spicy noodles and kimchi cheese pancakes. All food were excellent and we all enjoyed it very much, I didn't give it a five star due to the pricing was quite high for the amount of meat provided, not big portion, everything else was excellent, I had an excellent time with my friends. Way to go!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I usually go to kookminhakgyo close by but decided to give this place a try because it opened earlier. I love both restaurants. This one had flavours in general that were less spicy and more sweet. As soon as we got seated and ordered, they explained to us each side dish, and the meat cuts. The man even helped us grease up the grill and got us tea. Their corn cheese was delicious! Beef was so juicy. Although I wished they refilled our lettuce and side dishes more often, we had to ask before they did so, compared to the other Korean bbq where it was automatically noticed. Still fantastic will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I am going back for sure. By the way the cheese corn is not unlimited refills. Wish it was, because it is crazy delicious.

My only negative is there isn't great ventilation, and the smoke can bother your eyes...but it's so worth it lol"}
{"text":"Amazing prices for such good quality meat, and a lot more spacious than what it looks like from the outside. The interior is absolutely adorable -keeping it old fashioned South Korea. Friendly service and definitely a place to return to, parking may be tricky!!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place!!! 
And I love it only thing is I need to wait about 40 min but it worth it :))"}
{"text":"The best Korean BBQ in Toronto. The kimchi stew was amazing, pork belly and short ribs best in class. The side dishes were more delicious and more adventurous than I've seen anywhere else. Great staff, friendly and warm atmosphere. Looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Great Korean bbq. The location is a bit difficult to find parking so be sure to carpool.
the food was great and the atmosphere reminds one of Korean street-side dinning.
Great place for groups of friends to hang out, eat good food and have a few drinks.
This place does get quite packed so do make reservations for large groups or expect 30 minutes+ wait."}
{"text":"Cozy KBBQ spot. Got the pork belly and pork jowl with somaek. Reminds me of KBBQ in Koreatown Los Angeles.....just not as good. Still recommend though."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is slightly overrated. I'm torn between a 3 or 4 but considering it's a BBQ resto and my main issue is the meat, I bumped down. 
Mind you, this place is super busy so if all you care about is the meat, there's tons of other better options nearby. However, if vibe is your thing, this place has got it. It's got a nice atmosphere, cozy, with decor that makes you feel like you are in an authentic BBQ restaurant in Korea. It is clean and the place has very friendly customer service. It's just very packed so not much space to put meat and side dishes and no space for bags and coats. 

FOOD:
Meat - Honestly the quality is just OK. The meats were hard to chew. We had the ribeye and the hanging tender which was not tender at all. Only the pork belly was good maybe read some other reviews to see how other cuts were like. . 
Seafood pancake - this dish was really good with the soy marinade
Corn and cheese and egg side dishes were delicious and such a treat! Free refills :) 
Approx $25 pp for 3 meat portions and 1 seafood pancake. Honestly meat portions were small! But they give unlimited side dishes like steamed egg, corn with cheese, kimchee, and lettuce."}
{"text":"After getting recommended from a friend to go here, I went with my boyfriend on a Saturday night. We had a bad experience, and are likely never going to come back. 

Problem #1: We got there around 6, but it took us almost 2 hours (got a table at 8pm) and I had to convince my boyfriend to wait a little bit longer as he was getting irritable. It's understandable that the restaurant was busy as it's the weekend and its dinner service but a different waiter told us it would only take 30-45 minutes (which was the case for most people except us). When you get there there is a list that you sign up with, where only ONE of the servers sit you down. The problem is that the server didn't even go through the list based on a first come first serve basis (there was even someone ahead of us that never got called!!!). It seemed as though he was biased towards Korean people and larger tables, as his personality switched from a table across from us (happy vibe) and even brought them tea. I think an improvement could be made is that we could be given bags to put our clothes into so our clothes don't smell. 

Problem #2: After sitting us down, we got the beef rib eye roll (18.99), and beef hanging tender (19.99), Corona ($6.50), and Green Grape Soju (16.99), and the bill came to around $71. Note that your order has to be a minimum of two types of meat! The meat is overpriced, although it is higher quality than most places... I found it mediocre at best. Instead of going here, I could have made KBBQ at home and we would have been more full and enjoyed it more. It is only $30 for a box of MARINATED short ribs and $10-12 bucks for MARINATED bulgogi at PAT Central. Highlight of the meal was honestly just the potato salad, corn cheese and egg; which makes this place unique to a small degree. We were given some pork (service) for waiting so long, but ended up cooking it and not enjoying or eating it at all because it was disgusting due to the high levels of fat and put it onto a little dish for them to throw away. Servers weren't as attentive since it was a busy time, but another male server came by to refill our corn cheese and egg, and switched our grill when it burned which was really nice. For the most part though for the rest of the servers, it seems as though the servers don't care much about their service or tables at all.

Problem #3: Since the establishment was really small, it's a bit difficult to wait around in the front of the store since it is a narrow hallway. There is also only one washroom each for women and men, so you may have to wait a little bit to use the washroom downstairs. I noticed that an older lady who worked there kept going downstairs, and saw that there is a staff door across from the washroom, and she was bringing up tofu for the soup banchan (which is a little bit questionable). If you do go, try to get a seat in the back patio as it seems a lot more spacious and has ventilation for your cooking (apparently you can't sit there if you are drinking though :/).

I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is our first time coming to visit Daldonggnae. We loved the restaurant interior design looks pretty traditional. We order the pork belly, beef shoulder. Their corn and egg are surrounded the grill pan. Service was excellent, it comes pretty quick less than 10mins. If you are lucky to find a parking spot in front of the restaurant. That's a bonus. FYI limited spots there."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a chance on a whim and I'm SO glad I did. I can't go back to the all you can eat Korean bbq because this place was so authentic, so delicious, and so worth every penny. The service was absolutely fantastic and the atmosphere was super cute too."}
{"text":"This is my go-to KBBQ house! I love everything about Daldongnae - from ambience, food and service! All side dishes and the lettuce are refillable, even the sides around the grill! We all love the egg and cheesy corn, and with the side dishes being 'unlimited', we usually would get around 4 servings. They also provide a hot dwenjang jigae (Korean soy bean stew). 

On to the meat! I've tried a variety of their meat/cuts, and I have to say my favourite is always the pork belly ($15.99/portion). Their pork belly here is thick, juicy and not too fat which is very important when it comes to pork belly. When you wrap it with lettuce, ssamjang, garlic, onion, and kimchi... it's amazing! If you're thinking of beef, I've enjoyed their beef hanging tender ($19.99/portion). And on average, I've spent around $25-$30 per person with taxes and tips included. The meat and the sides fill you up a lot more than you think!

Daldongnae serves unique soju and makgeolli flavours. Soju flavours include: original, grapefruit and green grape. Makgeolli flavours include: original, banana and peach. I'm a big fan of the green grape soju! 

Why is it a 4 and 5 stars if I love this place so much...? Daldongnae is lacking KBBQ vents (?), unlike other KBBQ places... it does not have an individual vent on top of each grill, so the place can get pretty hot and smoky fast. Thus, your clothes will smell a lot more than other places and my eyes get pretty teary.

All in all, would I come back? MOST DEFINITELY."}
{"text":"I think this is the best spot for authentic Korean BBQ in town. Service is great even when it was super busy on that Friday evening that we went. The meat was delicious and they have different cuts of pork that I haven't seen at any other place such as pork jowl and pork skirt meat. The meat was definitely of good quality. I really enjoyed the variety and appreciated the number of appetizers that we got with the meal. This place refills the egg and corn by head count so if you go with a group of 5 just like us, there will be many refills. Also, their dipping sauce complemented the meat well. I also find that this place seems to cost less than Piggy's and Kobi and it tasted even better than those establishments. I would definitely come back to Daldongnae if I am ever feeling Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Been here several times and it became my favorite spot for Korean barbecue in Toronto.

Their price is very reasonable for everything that comes with it. I always order pork belly and try different beef. Beef ribs is the best one I tried so far, hanging tender is my second choice.

The side dishes are so good especially the potato  salad and the lettuce salad. The egg and cheese corn are amazing. The best part is everything is refillable. It also comes with a Korean miso soup. 

Love this place."}
{"text":"I am in love! Be warned, if you come looking for a meat feast, either you or your wallet will not be impressed.
Been here twice, wait times are long when you arrive at popular dinner times, but I was immediately seated when I got here at 6:40. 
They separate lines into drinking area and non drinking (semi outdoor) area. The drinking zone is nice and cozy, definitely on the cramped side but beautifully decorated. The non drinking looks like a makeshift section with heaters setup, but a lot more spacious and comfortable.
I've tried different cuts and find that anything that comes somewhat pre-cut to be more suited for this bbq (pork jowls, beef short ribs, beef \"finger meat\") - you can monitor the cook better to your liking. Meats are priced 15.99-25.99 depending on cut for 200g. I'd say that 1 order of meat is good for 1 person's dinner intake of meat. It looks like its very little, but all the super exciting sides will fill you plenty. Meats are fresh, certain cuts are better marbled but generally tasty. I love the sweet onion sauce and the other 2 dipping sauces(?) - complements all meats and provide good combinations.
Now my favourite part of this place, unlimited cheese corn and eggs! These themselves are well worth the value of however much you are paying. Cheese corn was sweet and the cheese melted so nice and stringy, I ate 3 rounds of these myself. Steamed egg was well seasoned and silky smooth even if you slightly over cook it. They also give you a free soup with veggies and tofu, it's tasty but nothing jumps at me. Other sides include lettuce wrap, kimchi, spicy cucumber, mushy seaweed, spicy lettuce kimchi and this AMAZING potato salad. (Not sure if they alternate, but I got the same stuff.)
Overall, meats are good quality, unlimited DELISH sides for under $25/person. (Think $40+ if you came just for meats)"}
{"text":"Daldongnae is wonderful. Great service and delicious food. Only downside is the wait is going to be long but try to come at off peak hours or coming in an hour in advance. 

The service here outshines any other Korean bbq establishment within the same price range. Bottomless corn cheese & steamed egg as well as attentive staff and gracious host was the highlight of this restaurant. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Aesthetically looks like an amazing place. Our group of 4 waited a long time Friday night and it was cold outside so the inside was PACKED BODY TO BODY in the tiny hallway/staircase. Horrible...
The meat portions are very small (100g) which is what one or two people can eat. They do give a lot of appetizers which are the things around the iron plate. However, I feel like most of them are fillers that you don't really eat much of, ex. The garlic slices. We also got 1 onion slice, some lettuce wraps... We didn't really touch those. My friend enjoyed the salt/pepper/oil dipping sauce the most for her meat while I liked the other too more. The one with onions is very light and a bit sweet. Overall I would not recommend the place as the actual meat was not spectacular and the prices are high for what you get. I feel like you mostly pay for the experience and there are tastier AYCE places for less per person cost."}
{"text":"After my trip to NYC's K-town where the more authentic korean bbqs have the egg and corn with cheese grilling on the side, I really wished there was something similar in Toronto! Fast forward to Sunday night when a couple of my friends were craving grilled meat, and coincidentally we saw Daldongnae pop up as a yelp recommendation. 

There was a total of 6 of us and we got seated almost immediately, despite the place looking quite full. It's actually more spacious that what it looks like on the outside and we got a table at the very back of the restaurant. The top of the chairs open up so you can put your jackets or purses inside of it so it won't smell like kbbq when you leave- I thought this was a cute touch.

We weren't sure which cuts of beef to order, so we ordered one of each and an order of the pork belly. We also ordered the seafood pancake and bottles of grapefruit soju.

Now it's no Baekjeong, there is no one that's going to prepare the meat and cook it for you, but the meal was still extremely good and satisfying. I liked that they provided each person with their own plate of sauces and onions. The heat could have been a bit lower, so that the egg can cook evenly without the giant bubbling. Also you have to eat the corn with cheese and remove the cloves of garlic pretty quickly because after awhile, it WILL start to burn.

The star of the night was definitely the pork belly. It was the perfect ratio of meat to fat. Please note that the portions are smaller than your regular korean bbq, but we liked that you didn't have to order a minimum of any kind of meat so we could try a variety!  The bbq came with two soybean soups, which were really good (but it got a bit more salty towards the bottom). I also really enjoyed the grapefruit soju and I wish it was more widely available for purchase at liquor stores. It's not strong at all, and the sweet grapefruit flavour goes really well with the soju. 

I've had better seafood pancake, so I wouldn't get this again next time. 

Service was OK. When you're wrapping the meat in lettuce and the onions, the juices kind of get all over, so more tissues would have been nice. It took them a long time to get us more tissues. But when we asked for more lettuce, it came pretty quickly- there was no extra charge for this. 

The meal came out to ~$32 per person after tax and before tip. Bonus that the waitress asked us if it would be separate bills before she grabbed the cheque, it makes things a lot easier when you're in a large group. The price is extremely reasonable and very affordable considering we also ordered alcohol. We all left full! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Even though the wait is a long time (30min) but the meat are fresh server are friendly"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant in Toronto. I had Korean BBQ here a lot! I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant! When I entered here for the first time, I felt very good because the interior is so nice! It's a cozy place for me! Also, the workers are so kind! Pork belly and Pork shoulder butt are my favorite! Korean BBQ is a little bit expensive but when I eat it, I wanna come here."}
{"text":"A cozy restaurant. You must wash yourself from head to bottom after meals at here lol. 
The quality of the meat is good. I enjoyed the sides around the hot plate, eggs, kimchi, garlic and cheese and corn  kimchi cold noodles is a surprise. The ice has special flavour. 

The manager is sincere and good at explaining the menu items. Overall the service of the staff is good. However, when one of the waitress cleaned up the table, she carelessly poured some liquid on my friend and on the chair. She just brought us some napkins. And did not clean up the chair."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been twice- once on a Friday night and once on a Tuesday night. They take reservations but will only hold your table for 10 minutes after your booked time. If you didn't make a reservation, you can put down your name/number at the counter.  

I enjoyed this place for many reasons! The interior is designed to replicate Korea in the 1960's and so I found it very unique.  Seeing that all-you-can-eat kbbq is more limiting for small eaters like myself, there's a larger menu selection here and I can order smaller amounts of meat if needed. Their standard portion is 200 grams for all types of meat (pork and beef). I've tried the pork belly, pork shoulder butt, beef short plate, beef rib eye, and kimchi cold noodle soup (which I highly recommend..I loved the strong seaweed taste). Both times that I visited, the bill came to ~$28-30 a person and we were pleasantly full. 

The kbbq came with the usual condiments and a few side dishes such as kimchi, mashed potato, salad and radish. The grill itself offered four different sides: garlic, melted corn cheese, kimchi, and eggs. During my second visit, I discovered that it is possible to get refills on the corn cheese and eggs! Lettuce and sauce refills are expected and the staff are always very polite and willing to help us refill. 

Finally something new and refreshing and I'm looking forward to visiting again! It's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place was quite popular, experienced a 30 min wait for a group of 3 last Wednesday night. Found the food to be alright - we got pork belly and beef tender, and they were definitely tasty but could've been larger in terms of portions in my opinion. The server was nice and introduced what each dish was when he bought them to us, but as the night progressed it became slightly harder to track him down, even though the place was emptying out a bit by then. I was pleasantly surprised by how clean our seating area was, no sticky spots or anything on the seats/floor, even though the busy/smokey atmosphere had me be a little weary.

Full disclosure here: this isn't really my favourite kind of food (find having to wrap stuff in lettuce leaves to be rather convoluted and messy, I've never been proficient at it), but I really couldn't find much wrong with the place and the experience was better than the previous K-BBQ place I've been to nearby (Kookminhakgyo), so I'm rating it 4 stars. If you're a fan of K-BBQ you would probably like it here."}
{"text":"Fave go-to kbbq spot! Service is always on point when I go. It gets very busy and may have to wait a bit for ur table. They just opened another location just 2min drive north on Yonge across centre point mall, bigger location if you have a larger group :)"}
{"text":"Great kbbq place! You order your meat ala cart, price is a little expensive but the food quality is good. The banchan is different from the usual stuff you get too. Ordered the ribeye and pork shoulder both were good! Served with cheesy corn warm kimchi. Would recommend this place for kbbq goers!!"}
{"text":"A great place to go if you want some delicious Korean BBQ. 
We ordered a pork jowl, beef hanging tender and kim chi pancake. 
The portions were good, but a little on the pricey side (200g for $16.99 to $19.99) if you're used to cheaper AYCE Korean BBQ. 
All of the free side dishes were quite delicious as well. There wasn't one dish I didn't like lol. 
The decor is interesting, different and really cool.
Some seats doubled as storage for your coat or purse. 
There are however 2 negative points; rear parking was difficult to find but you can park on a side street for free after 4pm and there was no soap in the washrooms."}
{"text":"I love Korean BBQ and my friend decided to take me here for my birthday. The place did not disappoint. We came here during the ice storm so my friends showed up half an hour late. So, I started ordering thinking that everything would take a while to prepare. I was wrong. As soon as I ordered, everything came at once, which was amazing if I didn't have to wait for everyone.

Well, 15 minutes in, I couldn't just nibble on the appetizers. I ordered the pork belly and started grilling it. I also ordered the beef finger meat and short ribs. I didn't realize how chewy the finger meat would be. The pork belly and short ribs were good though.

The best part about this place is that they give you so many sides and always ask if you want it to be refilled. All the waitresses are standing around and are so attentive. I could not really ask for better service.

The atmosphere is like an old Asian corridor made of wood. Similar to Ssam on Yonge and Finch. I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Daldongnae offers authentic Korean BBQ in a causal setting (no cooking service). 

Atmosphere is causal and trendy; retro 80's decor is so cool. There are many large tables and great for groups to BBQ and drink. Service is very friendly and prompt. The owner will patiently explains/recommends different meat/drinks on the menu. I especially love the song playlist (recent Korean drama OST) the owner chooses. 

My review is only based on BBQ experience since I didn't order any cooked food or appetizer. It has a minimum 2 orders policy, but the good thing is you can mix and match the type of meat. The meat quality is good and they only put simple very minimal salt and pepper on the Pork Shoulder Butt, bare on the Pork Jowl. The BBQ comes with a tofu soup, lettuce and carrot sticks (refillable), raw onion with sauce (refillable), banchan (refillable). The BBQ pan comes with liquid egg batter, cheese corn, kimchi and garlic. It is a very nice experience to have authentic Korean BBQ. 

Price is very reasonable. Meat prices from $16-20 per order. 

The only down side is the ventilation of the place is so so; you would smell like BBQ after the meal. Just don't wear your expensive winter jacket."}
{"text":"Food- amazing. Satisfying. Ordered the beef short ribs and beef fingers and both were great! Comes with plenty of side dishes, and very flavourful. On the side, there are various dipping sauces, sesame oil, a hearty beef dip, and your own personal radish, light and sweet tasting sauce. Mmmm! On the side of the grill you'll find egg, cheese corn, garlic and kimchi! All such compliments to the kbbq on the grill. Recommend eating the meat with lettuce and other side dishes. Flavour blast!! 

Service - excellent service. The waiter was able to explain everything on the table before starting and also recommended what complemented each other.

Parking- hard to find. Usually packed. Drive around until you find one close to the restaurant. 

Price- With the amount of food yet and the quality if I get it I would say the price is worth it. After the night was over my friend and I spent about $30 a person and we left content and full.

I would definitely come back and try this place again as it would be a continuous joint that I would be eating at when I am craving Korean barbeque. In addition I believe that this place would need an extension for the amount of people walking through the doors. Excellent!"}
{"text":"After visiting this place, many have asked... was it worth the wait? 

I came at around 10 PM and was seated by 10:45 PM. This was a Saturday night, so I should've foreseen this. Other than that, it must mean the food is good and everyone just wants to eat while admiring the '60s decor. 

The food was delicious. We ordered the pork belly and beef finger meat for our BBQ. It was really nice and tender and we made lettuce wraps out of them. 

The banchan was a little off for me. I didn't like the cucumber and felt that the kimchi was overly fermented to my preference.

The egg and cheese/corn bonus to the BBQ made for a yummy snack/dip for our meal. 

Overall, great meal, reasonable price, and great service."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth visiting! The customer service at this place is very likeable as the waiter was incredibly kind, attentive and definitely experienced in his position. He often asked us what we needed throughout our meal and made sure our time there was enjoyable with cheerful and upbeat manners. Host/waiter definitely left an impression on us. 

The food was also delicious and definitely was enough to make me content and satisfied. I ordered the Korean bbq plate with pork, beef and something else for two people and very much enjoyed the eggs and corn that cooked on the side, as well as the cheese. All item were recommended my the waiter and worked well together. 

The atmosphere was semi dim and left a bar vibe or a romantic, cool and chill vibe to the restaurant so that was also a plus in my books. No one likes eating at a restaurant where you can see your company's pores lol. 

This definitely was surprising as I stumbled upon it as I was on a lookout for a restaurant on a bus, and definitely do not regret anything.

It is a bit more on the pricier side but the quality was well deserving."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Just go straight for the BBQ - pork belly, pork shoulder, rib eye, and all that. It doesn't come with rice but it has lettuce, soup, Korean side dishes and the best part is the rim around the bbq plate that has cheese corn, egg and kimchi. I personally think that Daldongnae has the best K-bbq in Toronto with the price and quality."}
{"text":"2.5 stars - not good value for your money. Not the place to come if you want to get full. I'm surprised that none of the reviews mention the price because I found the prices to be pretty exorbitant, even for the North York area.

100 g of meat can go anywhere from $15.99 - $25.99. That's a super small portion size, in my honest opinion. I came here with my bf's family because I saw the amazing yelp reviews and we were so disappointed with the portion size.

Yes, it's true that it's all you can eat corn cheese, steamed egg, and banchan. And the quality of the food was great, but i just cannot get over the price for 200 g of meat. My bf's dad asked if there was a second platter of meat coming and the waitress answered, \"It's all here\". 

I was so embarrassed for recommending this place haha. I won't be coming here again only because I cannot get past the food quality to price ratio."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean bbq place in Toronto. Good food, atmosphere, and service was on point.

I came here with a group of 4 and despite it being so busy on a Friday night 8pm-ish we were seated pretty quickly. First things first, I LOVED the ambience of this resto. It felt like I had travelled back to a Korean sool jip/pocha. I loved the old Korean decor on the walls of old cigarette boxes, telephones, soju bottles, etc.

We had the pork belly, rib eye, kimchi jjigae, dwenjang jjigae, and it came with a lot of good banchans. Everything we had was AMAZING. The best part was that there was unlimited corn and cheese. I think they put something in their kimchi jjigae because it was one of the best Ive ever had (and I'm Korean). haha 

Since the resto was super busy, the waitstaff did not come as often to check up on us but when we did get their attention they were really great to us, especially about refilling all the banchans and corn/cheese. It is pricey but it is Korean bbq. And everything we had was so good that I would come back every time I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great services with great food.  Unlimited refill to bbq egg and corn & cheese.  Super delicious."}
{"text":"Another joint that gives its fellow KBBQ grillhouse neighbours on uptown Yonge a run for their money. This place is bustling, with the Maillard scent permeating throughout. A wooden cabin like feel like Ssam, but the storage stools like Kookminhakgyo, definitely an authentic feel. The cheese kimchi pancake and the squid were delicious. The various banchan seemed very much identical in flavour profile as if they were pickled in the same solution---a little boring. But you're not here for that---you're here for the unlimited cheese corn and egg moats! A cast iron grill ring serving as vessels for a mixture of corn and shredded cheese and another for egg mixture, it was an interesting experience. Unfortunately not really ideal for any epic cheese pulls to wrap your meat in but still quite enjoyable. The service was friendly and overall acceptable, but I wish that they weren't so hard-pressed to execute your order so quickly as to not be able to take more than one request at a time. My table experienced difficulty with the butane gas canister being near empty when we started resulting in uneven cooking or variable cooking speeds. The meat itself was expectedly delectable and of above average quality. Ventilation needs improvement; there are tables at the back with dedicated vents but there were none to be seen for the front three-quarters of the restaurant. Men's room is a little awkward. Who installs a urinal less than a foot away from the sink without partitions?
All in all, worth a visit if you haven't been."}
{"text":"A bit of a wait but worth it. The place is pretty small but the food was great. It's a bit on the expensive side but they have the best bibimbap we have ever had in Toronto! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Highly Recommend. Good sevcie - goos food. I love it here. We got pork belly and beep rip so good"}
{"text":"Can't say I'm a fan of this place. The menu is cryptic, ordered rib-eye expecting bite sized pieces (like literally every other k-bbq place) and we got a single slab of meat. The food is tasty, but no better than any other Korean bbq place I've tried. We got two soups but no spoons or bowls to eat them with, and only two sets of sides for 7 people paying at least $20 each.

The service was fine, but at one point they took our water bottle and just never returned with it, we had to ask for it back, full, but that may have been because it was busy.

Most disappointing part of the whole experience: lack of meat choices. You get pork. You get beef. They give you choices of 6 different cuts of each, but nothing else. Don't come here if you can't eat one of these meats, I wish they had chicken, fish, and seafood options but alas, no luck here. 

Overall, good place if you're in a pinch, but I wouldn't come back here unless I lived nearby. No worth the gas/TTC money."}
{"text":"Want KBBQ that satisfies those taste buds with a side of AMAZING customer service? Look no further as this place gives you the best of both worlds!

We ordered 2 orders of pork belly along with a large cold noodle and let me tell you, I've never had such amazing pork belly in my life! The pork belly was deeply marinated and tastes exceptional. The presentation of the cold noodles looked similar to a BiBimbap; assorted toppings on the side with noodles in the middle and they give you a plastic glove to mix everything. Initially, we ordered 2 cold noodles and then our server informed us that it'd be a huge portion and suggested we order one large noodle instead. Thus, we went for the one large noodle and thank goodness we did! Aside from the pork belly and cold noodles, did I mention the plethora of side dishes as well?! No joke, our table of 4 was filled! The side dishes consisted of kimchi, pickled radish, mashed potato, seawood, egg and cheese-corn. We were also given condiments like garlic, jalapeno peppers, onions and lettuce to eat with our pork belly.

What do I mean by AMAZING customer service? Well, our server was very hospitable. He came to check up on us every now and them to make sure everything was going well and if we needed anything. I think 'exceptional' would be a better word to describe the customer service here.

With the amount of food eaten between the four of us, it was only around 20 bucks split among us - what a deal!! Will definitely be back for another visit!!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Wednesday night, the place was packed, luckily we didn't have to wait for a table. The interior made me feel like I was in a kdrama! Quite small though, I would make reservations on the next visit. 

Ordered the pork belly and pork jowl with a friend. The meat is fresh and good quality. Portions are a bit small for what you're paying, but keep in mind there are many side dishes! They had egg and cheese corn on the grill. Really enjoyed the potato salad. 

Attentive service even though it was a busy night. They refilled our side dishes without us having to ask."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! If you enjoy Korean bbq. Go here! The guy at the front was so nice! He just keep coming and asking us if we needed anything. If we called our server and she/he was busy he was there to serve you. I liked their beef but I thought pork was better!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I unexpectedly stumbled upon this kbbq gem while walking around the Yonge/Finch area. With no prior Yelp reviews to rely on we were unsure of what to expect. 
At around 6:30pm the restaurant was packed and we waited 40 mins to get our table.  The place is best suited for smaller groups (2 or 4) as I didn't see any large tables.  When we got our seats, we asked the waiter for recommendations and we ended up ordering pork belly - $15.99 and beef rib finger meat - $25.99. The meal came with cheese&corn, eggs, roasted garlic, kimchi, mushrooms, seaweed salad, pickled radishes, squash, onions and veggies to be used for wrapping the meat. They also gave us a complimentary Korean tofu soup. The food was amazing, I'm really happy we tried this place!  The sides complimented the meats perfectly. Portion wise ordering 2 types of meat was enough for 2 people. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Hands down best kbbq I've had in Toronto! It's arguably comparable to Kang Hodong Baekjeong in LA I think! Except I quite like the side dishes offered here and the soy sauce & onion marinade is more flavourful.

I came here on a Weds evening at 5pm and it's still relatively quiet but crowds starting coming in around 7:30pm. It's relatively new but once people try this place out, I can imagine it will be packed (I heard on weekends it's already 40 min wait cause it doesn't seat that many people). 

The decor is so nice and the atmosphere is really on point - really has a whole vintage Korean vibe that makes your dining experience all the more authentic. The service was top notch - the server explained to us the cuts of meat, what was popular, what he recommended and helped us with cooking time! They're not at the level like Piggy's where they cook for you but if that doesn't matter to you, I much prefer the cuts here! Definitely try the pork belly and rib eye if you're not sure what to order. 

I'll definitely be back again and would highly recommend it to my friends!"}
{"text":"A pretty amazing place for some authentic KBBQ. The portions size look small but it's a lot of food once you start eating! It got my Korean friend's sticker of approval. Good service and good for groups but go early or else you'll have to wait in line for a seat. There's no parking infront of the restaurant but there's side street parking on Patricia Avenue. Only complaint is that the tables are too small to put all the food on the table. Happy dining~"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cute space. That being said, the portions are quite small for what you're paying. I came here with a friend and we ordered the: 

1. Pork skirt meat
It was alright, nothing to write home about 

2. Beef rib eye
Pretty tender, only needed a few mins on the grill and then it was juicy and ready to eat. 

The extra banchans were minimal and the tofu jigae-ish soup we got was weirdly sweet?

I'm docking 1 star for the hefty pricetag and another for not being able to flag down a server sometimes. It was very busy on a Thursday night and while they had about 4-5 servers working, they always seemed to be preoccupied with another table. 

This place is so close in proximity and likeness to Kookminhakgyo that you can go check out both and see which one has a shorter line the next time you're craving KBBQ. 

TLDR; there's better KBBQ places in the area that gives you more for your money (quality and quantity)."}
{"text":"Cozy little place. Great authetic korean BBQ that is a la carte. Friendly staff and very helpful with recommendations.  It gets really busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very nice setting. Clean and charming. Staff are very friendly.   Pork belly was super fatty. Beef was nice"}
{"text":"Writing this review after one visit with a friend. When you walk in, you can already feel the lively atmosphere. Everything is very authentic which I really appreciate. Definitely one of the best Korean BBQ places in Toronto. It was a little busy when we went and we were seated in the back where they recently built an extended area. I was very happy to be seated there as the main area was much more crowded. They had heat lamps set up so it wasn't cold at all. Overall, a very friendly, lively and authentic place to eat. Prices are also reasonable.

Food: 5/5
Great food. Again, very authentic. They gave us a lot of side dishes and add ons so that with two servings of meat for two people was very filling.

Service: 5/5
No complaints here. The servers were very friendly and accommodating. Whatever we needed they brought very fast. The staff are really friendly.

Cleanliness 5/5
Also no complaints. Everything was great!

I would come back again for sure and bring my friends too. It's a great place for groups."}
{"text":"This is the kbbq place I've been meaning to try and it did not disappoint. Right off the bat the service was friendly and luckily we went at a good time so the waiting time was minimal. The samgyepsal (pork belly) is a must but we also got the beef chuck and and pork jowl. The food also came with plenty of side dishes and the grill had accompanying cheese corn, egg and kimchi. They also have a great selection of drinks and the food is paired best with some soju! The atmosphere is lively as expected of a Korean grill joint and the decor is comfortable and rustic! The price is definitely higher than other kbbq places especially if you order drinks but otherwise I would definitely come again especially with friends!"}
