{"text":"I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this mediocre diner-style deli, but it's not bad.  The large portion sizes and kitschy decor has its own grimy charm, and the specials are really affordable.  Also, the food comes out suspiciously quickly, but that's not a bad thing if you're starving and want to eat a big meal.

This a popular brunch and lunch spot, and for people who want lots of food for a bargain of a price.  You can expect a line-up on weekends for brunch.

If you're in the area and you're jonesing for breakfast, I recommend the Regal brunch, if only for the melt-in-your-mouth cretons, which are outstanding."}

Grand choix de menu, service rapide, repas moyen rien de.different ni de vraiment goûteux...
Banquette souvent sale ou abîmée."}
{"text":"Ah, Regal! This place brings back memories, of many a family restaurant meal, and of takeout pizza meals at home. A few changes since back in the day, they are now BYOB and the portion sizes have shrunken slightly to reasonable portions I actually have a hope of finishing. The best bet will always be something off the \"menu Du jour\". Liver, hamburger steak, fish and chips ... your classic family fare, with something for everyone. They also do breakfast. It definitely isn't fancy food, but it's delicious! 

Most recently I had a hamburger steak, my go-to. Yummy gravy and fries onions atop a pretty standard patty. Mixed veggies that were tender crisp, not soggy. The only weak point of the plate was that they didn't have mashed potatoes, I had to choose between fries or Greek potatoes. I choose Greek potatoes, and they were good, but not as good as mashed potatoes would have been. Another low point was that they didn't have rice pudding for dessert, the choices were black forest cake or jello. As you might realize by now, I like to stick to my go-tos :)

Of note for people dining with kids: they've got high chairs and boosters, and aren't phased by kids. Always a plus for us as we rarely go anywhere without the little guy in tow. He very much approved of the buns they brought out at the beginning of the meal, giant spongy white bread he slowly devoured bite by bite."}
{"text":"Great experience all around!

I remember ordering pizza from this place in a past life and remembered it to be classic Montreal style pizza.

When I re-discovered it I noticed they also have Montreal style subs.  Cooked subs with steak, pepperoni, and smoked meat topped with cheese, onions, peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, and dressing.

I pushed very hard to make sure we went here on this trip and thankfully my family and travel companions conceded.

The pizza is just as good as I remembered it, probably the best in Montreal.  The subs were good as well.  I wasn't blown away by the sub as I have been in the past from other places, but I think I over-hyped it in my head.  They were delicious.

I also tried the escargot and Coquilles St. Jacques (gotta love family food sharing) and they were top notch!

Not only was the food incredible, but the service was as well.  Our server was super friendly and really enjoyed his job.

The menu is very extensive.  You would have a difficult time not finding SOMETHING you like, regardless of how picky you are.

Definitely worth the drive to Brossard!"}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast on Saturday morning. This is the second time I go eat there.

The good: Food is actually good. Service is usually good also as the waitresses are usually friendly. High chairs for kids.

The bad: Choice of sport on tv is very poor, there was live Euro 2016 matches but they prefer staying on TVA Sports where they talk about hockey and fishing. Quality of people is kind of poor. Prices in menu does not make sense (a plate of three crepes costs more than three crepes ordered individually). Place is busy and loud.

The place is okay for breakfast, but since there is so much other breakfast places on the south shore, there are better options out there."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here, as it is a regular for my friends who live in Montreal. We all went here for a Sunday morning brunch and were not let down! The portions are so much better and bigger than any diner in CT and the waitress was very nice and efficient. I ordered a 12-egg white veggie omelet (I eat a lot of protein) and my friends got the house breakfast which includes 2 eggs, sausages, Canadian bacon, pâté, toast, bacon and home fries and a juice! Holy crap!! We enjoyed the service, sitting outside was very nice and we enjoyed our time and paying was easy too. Great time and the food was really good. The omelet was incredible and my friends loved their food."}
{"text":"Depuis la nouvelle administration, tout un changement !!! 
Nourriture excellente, personnel courtois et accueillant, ce n'est plus le restaurant que j`ai connu jadis, très bon rapport qualité prix, de la pizza au filet mignon, choix varié et tout est délicieux , je vous le recommande !"}
{"text":"We use to go for breakfast here and it was good. It closed down and reopened in the last couple days. I guess new owners. We had a horrible experience. Some of the stuff we could have looked past.
..but the rest is inexcusable. They brought coffee with no milk or cream, took forever to get some. Then they bring our food and tell us the toast and bagel are coming.. We wait forever and our food is getting cold. I eat some grapes off my plate and they are all rotten. My boyfriend asked for his meat well done and we had to send it back. We then complain to the bus boy about the grapes and the toast and bagel we still haven't received he tells us it's not his problem and  he honestly doesn't care...!?!??. So we tell the waitress what he said. They try to rectify the situation. The bagel finally comes with the cream cheese missing. What pushed us over the edge was the black hair I found in my salmon. We left..."}
