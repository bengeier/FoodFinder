{"text":"Ordered spicy sausage pizza and wings.  They were here in less than half an hour.  Thin crust is the ultra thin crunchy style that I love.  Wings were perfect.  Great pizza, will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly service! We love the pepperoni pizza here. Also the online ordering was super easy and the pizza was ready in less than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out last night because I saw a lot of good reviews on other sites. Overall, this was a good local place and I might order again if ever back in the Middleton area.

The pizza had good, fresh toppings. The issue I had was with the crust. It was bland. I am usually the guy who finishes everyone else's crust but I couldn't eat this one.

I ordered the breadsticks as well, which is just their crust with some Parmesan and seasoning sprinkled on top, so they weren't that tasty either - I would pass on them. Their marinara was good and did help me eat some of the breadsticks."}
{"text":"I waited an hour for my pizza to be delivered. When the sketchy pizza delivery guy showed up he was really pushy about me \"using this coupon code when I call next.\" Not out of the norm but slightly weird. Well I get back into my house and open the pizza box which reveals  a completely destroyed pizza. All the cheese and sauce is in one corner. I call them and their solution is to offer me a coupon code for a free pizza. Not to refund my money.  The real kicker was they were then closed so I couldn't even get another pizza delivered. Never ordering from here again. Horrible business model in an already oversaturated market."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, especially for a Friday night (~40 min). The hand tossed crust is thick and delicious. We enjoyed the Zona--just the right amount of buffalo kick, as well as a Supreme, which hit the spot, too. Skip the breadsticks. The pizza was great and they didn't hold up. Will order again. Nice addition to Middleton."}
