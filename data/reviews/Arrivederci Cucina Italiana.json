{"text":"We have always gone to the one on Thunderbird, which is nice. We decided to check this one out (family owned also) and met Angelo, this owner. The ambiance is beautiful and our server, Christian, was knowledgeable about the food and the wine. Great experience. But the real kudos go the wonderful food. Our daughter ate her spaghetti bolognese and as I am Italian, we are pretty much connossiors of good bolognese. It was divine. My husband had the Cioppino (white) and almost picked up the bowl to slurp the juice (thankfully, he stopped himself. :)) The plentiful, fresh seafood combined with the briny, sumptuous sauce was absolutely awesome. He is still raving about it. But my dish was the best on the table- I had a sole petrale with gorgeous, crispy mixed vegetables and a wild mushroom risotto that made us swoon. My hubby doesn't like risotto, but he LOVED this one. Then on to dessert- they have a \"chocolomissou.\" I don't eat dessert, but it was delicious. And we had two ice creams- salted carmel (just loved it) and girlie had the vanilla.  All in all, a great fine dining find in Fountain Hills. There is no other restaurant like this in the area. We were in Amalfi last year and the food rivaled Italy's.   We will be back next week for sure! BRAVO!  Laurie and Rodney Malone"}
{"text":"I took my mom here to see if this would be a great place to host my wedding rehearsal dinner. Not only was the food fantastic, but the service was exquisite! The food beams of authentic Italian cuisine cooked homemade with a small touch of American style. Italian food for me is typically heavy with oils and fats but my lunch was delicious and light. I had the gnocchi with pesto sauce while my mom has the cheese ravioli. I could taste the homemade ingredients (not to mention the delicious in house olive oil). Angelo even served us a homemade cannoli on the house. I am looking forward to having our rehearsal dinner here. I'll post back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Not much to look at from the front but once inside very nice. Excellent meal from the bread, salads, entrees to dessert and wine.  Great service as well. Excellent and attentive waiter (and busser)--I'd definitely go back as I'll be thinking about this meal for some time."}
{"text":"Let me Thank You for all of FH for being here and bring us top notch Italian Food  with a high Standard .."}
{"text":"Solid classic Italian. I had the meatball panini for lunch, my husband had chicken parmigiana. A good place for lunch or dinner. Added benefit if the weather is nice, you can sit outside and watch the fountain, it's right on the lake."}
{"text":"Had lunch with two friends and all of us were very satisfied with the fare. I had a delicious plate of ravioli with a sauce so good that I lapped it up with a couple of pieces of their delicious bread. Had a glass of open wine that was very good and rounded off the meal with a double espresso. Great service, nice setting, reasonable prices. A little noisy but that's what you get with lots of customers! Best new restaurant in Fountain Hills and am sure it will succeed. Oh, and the waiter Eugene is a professional."}
{"text":"If your looking for great food always, exceptionally well prepared food come here. Love this place, we eat here regularly. The staff is friendly and caring. The chef delivers  ...the food steaks are so tender. The Fettuccine to die for The ambience is casual but sophisticated. Light feeling and fun."}
{"text":"Average experience - we won't return! What we liked:  1. Service - Jesse was patient in allowing us to taste a couple of white wines. The food arrived on time and Jesse was very attentive, as were the various servers. 2. The bread and dipping oil was tasty. 3. The bottle of $60 Chianti Reserva was the perfect temperature, but it was unremarkable with an edgy finish even after breathing for an hour.  What was unremarkable: 1. Our table for two was so close to the next table that you could hear every word and breath of the people next to us. We might as well have moved the tables together and struck up a conversation. Some date night! There is little ambience in the place as sound echoes pretty loudly also. The bar looked inviting! 2. It was warm in the restaurant - a ceiling fan moved the air around but we were sticking to the seats by the time we got up. We heard the people at the next table talking about it as well. Turn up the air conditioning - it is August in AZ!  3. The food was average - we had the Buffalo Caprese (better tomatoes at Safeway and licorice-tasting oil on dish), Divina Cesare (tasty, light salad dressing), Ciambotta di Pollo E Salsiccia (sausage and sauce very tasty; large chicken chunks were tough) and Ravioli Caprese (pasta undercooked for our liking).  We were excited about a new Italian restaurant opening in Fountain Hills and perhaps our expectations were too high. We spent $140 (including 20% tip) and were pretty disappointed. Back to Scottsdale for Italian food!"}
{"text":"Ate there a week after opening. Going back this evening for a second try. This time I will ask for a table in the western section away from the bar noise. The food is good and noise distracts me from enjoying it. I had their version of Eggplant Parmigiana and may order it again unless one of the specials is tempting. Only disappointment was the cannoli whose filling was so bland that I must believe it was a first attempt for the staff to prepare. With the departure of Appian Way this was badly needed. No Pizza but a varied menu that should please most palates."}
{"text":"We live in FH and have been wanting to try this place.  We walked in and the hostess asked us the typical questions.  Well, she whispered actually.  I had to ask her several times to repeat herself.  You think she could've at least went up a decibal or two?  No.  The music....it wasn't Italian, which was disappointing.  Decor is nice but again, nothing Italian about it.  The Russian waiter was polite, well-spoken and accommodating.  I ordered a White Russian drink.....it had no Khalua in it!!  Sent it back.  I ordered angel hair with Alfredo and chicken.  The chicken was nicely grilled, a little cajun-ish, which I like.  The Alfredo was very bland, no amount of pepper would help.  The side order of veggies was cool, temperature-wise.  On to dessert.  I had coffee and choc-misu (or something like that).  It was decent.  The coffee was very strong and cool temperature-wise, not hot.  Unfortunately, I have no desire to pay that kind of money again for a similar experience.  I won't be back.  Don't think hubby will either."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! Finally a good restaurant in Fountain Hills! Fresh hand made pastas in house & authentic flavorful Italian food! Wonderful pesto dipping sauce for the bread which is a nice touch. The owner Angelo introduced himself right away & was working right along side the staff. Since it was our first time, we were welcomed with the most delicious complimentary dessert. They really make you feel like family & my sister in law & I could have sat there all night! So welcoming! We both Had the special which was soooo delicious! We had the famous waiter Eugene as mentioned in previous reviews- they are right, he was wonderful! By far the best food and service in Fountain Hills & I have been here a long time! Great place! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good food but a bit pricey for the quality. I can't understand why happy hour is limited to the bar only. It's very difficult to engage in conversation at the bar when you are with more than one person.  Too bad as I know of several groups that go elsewhere because of that....my group included."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian Restaurants in AZ and by far the Best in Beautiful Fountain Hills! Great place for happy hour and the dinners are incredible. We've been several times with friends and they are always raving about the food. Angelo is always gracious and does an absolutely wonderful job making people feel welcome. Plus, the specials they come up with are always amazing! You've got to check this place out. Sitting outside by the fountain is one extra bonus you just don't get anywhere else. Mangia"}
{"text":"It's always exciting to try something new. The atmosphere is nice, the view is nice. We were quickly served our water when we were seated along with our menus. I had the spaghetti and meatballs(there's a fancy name for it on the menu) The dish was OK, but I wouldn't say amazing. My husband had the Pazanella which was simply a salad with croutons. After dinner we went to the bar for a drink and met Dustin the bartender, very nice and attentive. The chef and owner were very open to our suggestions. We would visit again and try something else on the menu. Can't beat the view!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic homemade Italian food that tastes amazing, Fountain Hills now has it. It is nice to finally have a good quality restaurant in town to dine at. Arrivederci has a very relaxed yet elegant feel to it with a professional, attentive and knowledgeable wait staff most whom are authentic Italian. The inside has a very warm ambiance and there is additional patio seating with beautiful views of the fountain.  The bar has great happy hour pricing on both food and cocktails like $5.00 glasses of wine or cocktails and $2.50 for draft beer and is available from 3-7 everyday...Much better than most happy hour times in town. The Burrata is to die for. You can tell the owners and chef truly care about creating the perfect dining experience. The restaurant carries a very extensive wine list and all the dishes are made in house daily with fresh local ingredients. There are many gluten free selections available as well as a wonderful kids menu.  I cant say enough great things about Arrivederci other than I wish it were larger as its becoming so popular that you may soon need reservations."}
{"text":"I would have gave it 1 star, but my boyfriend for some reason enjoyed his meal. I have high expectations with my food and the pasta was not cooked all the way and was still hard. The sauce tasted as though it was from a canned sauce you buy from the store. We won't be going back here. Too bad because the view was nice. Forgot to add, the waitress sucked. You can at least pretend to be cheerful, it's your job duh - sorry you hate it."}
{"text":"Traveling for the holiday and found this restaurant on Yelp. Excellent food and pretty inside. They have a very nice outdoor patio as well. Mangia!"}
{"text":"Charlie. The singing bartender that is easy on the eyes, a fun and attentive bartender, and great to talk with. My friend is a friend of his, and that's the main reason we went to Arrivederci. By the way, they offer good glass pours for the price, and a good wine list (primarily affordable Italian wines).  On to the food:  excellent!  I ordered the cioppino, which was full of seafood and pasta and excellent!  My friend ordered the sea bass, which was also very good. We split the chocolate tiramisu. It was fantastic. A great little find in Fountain Hills. Entrees were priced well, and the service was quite good. Thanks, Charlie!"}
{"text":"We started off with a bread basket and delicious pesto. We ordered the Calamari to start, Eggplant Parmesan and Lasagna entrees. Both were absolutely delicious! A repeat next visit. We topped the night with some yummy salted caramel gelato. Service was excellent, highly attentive, always filling the beverages, and best restaurant to enjoy dinner with the view of the fountain. I'm glad there is another option for dinner, we used to go to Euro Cafe and can't even compare the two restaurants.  Arrivederci is a far better choice."}
{"text":"Saturday night, 700pm reservation, very  warm to say the least . Got drinks and bread and one hour later .....dinner finally arrived.  The food was  Presented well but taste was nothing remarkable. It was very noisy , nothing to break the noise. This is my 2nd visit and would not come back for dinner , maybe try  Happy hour  as the bar is attractive."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch and dinner. It is very nice inside and they have a lovely patio outside overlooking Fountain Park, lake and fountain. The food is terrific and the staff is very very good and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This place is legit, fresh food, properly prepared.  My wife is allergic to dairy and gluten intolerant, our server went out of his way to take care of us and give her one of the best meals out we've had in awhile!"}
{"text":"We love the location and many of the menu items. Unfortunately, they have a terrible happy hour.  Discouraging for families, because they won't allow you to enjoy happy hour unless you sit at the bar.  And, you can't sit at the bar with kids.  Not a good family place."}
{"text":"The food was Amazing!  The outdoor patio overlooks the fountain and it's a wonderful setting. I was impressed with everything, the quality and service and ambiance. Our server, Eugene was friendly and prompt and we loved this place!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous Italian dinner. Our Server Eugene, formerly from Roka Akor, as always phenomenal.  Knew the menu and specials, recommendations were excellent choices!! Very professional. When you make a reservation or walk in request Eugene's Station you will not be sorry. The Manager and Hostess of this new restaurant were very visible and made inquiry as to the service and food, refilling our waters and beverage.  The pesto, served with the great assorted bread basket is superb!! This is a true winner.  Eating outside you see the beautiful Fountain. ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with a great atmosphere right in the heart of Fountain Hills.  We had just moved to Fountain Hills and we were given a gift certificate for dinner here from our realtor.  We chose to eat outside on the patio. What a pleasant surprise when the huge fountain started going in the middle of the lake. The setting sun reflected off of it and it made for a very memorable dining experience.  They also have a great selection of imported wines.  I recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Went here on our second date, and just recently celebrated our second anniversary here too. The food was delicious and staff was so kind and generous. Very authentic Italian food. The lake is gorgeous for a date as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice addition to Fountain Hills!  Enjoyed dinner on the patio facing the park and fountain.  Our server was pleasant and attentive.  Our table ordered the arrancini, fried calamari, penne alla norma and cioppino.  All were delicious, but the calamari, although cooked perfectly, was a tad over-salted.  They have a nice wine selection and full bar.  The bar area was packed but will definitely stop by for happy hour another time as everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Pricing was good for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I am visiting on business from Southern CA. Staying at the Lexington Hotel across the street from the restaurant. I went on Yelp and found this very good restaurant. Eugene was an excellent server. Had the Salmone alla Puttenesca which was delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible service , took my sister here for lunch and never got our meals after waiting 2hours."}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant after playing disc golf at the park right near it. The waitress suggested the lasagna which both me and my wife had. The portions are generous and the taste was really good."}
{"text":"We ate here and had a nice meal. The service is good and the food is ok. The only problem is the price of the entrees in relation to what arrives on your plate. At the end of our dinner, we had sticker shock. We admitted that there are other places that provide a better value for your money."}
{"text":"This was the 3rd visit and the best thus far. Everyone loved their dish. I ordered Oso buco and it was superb! The wine list is great and I really enjoyed the pesto while looking over the menu. They have a nice ambiance and the crowd for Monday is evidence of how great this place is."}
{"text":"Delicious place with genuinely nice people! Just visiting here and stumbled on this restaurant by fountain park! Beautiful view with super delicious food! We ordered ravioli with lobster, lasagna, and a bottle of seven falls merlot. No regrets!! Yum! We had the bread pudding for my friends bday and my gosh probably the best one I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"This place has a pretty decent menu however I feel like that it's a little overpriced for what you get. There are at least two other locations, one in San Diego, and I believe there's one in Scottsdale. I haven't been to the one in Scottsdale but I have been to the San Diego location many times and has much better quality food, in my opinion.   That said, the service is very good, but sometimes a little slow. The restaurant is very clean but it can also be very noisy at times.   The bar is excellent."}
{"text":"After a year we thought we'd give this restaurant another try. Nth service was ver good.  Staff was very attentive.  Food was good and prices are reasonable, including the wine options.    Husband had the veal Marsala and enjoyed it.  I had one of the signature sausage and chicken past dishes.  It was just ok.  Probably shouldn't have ventured too far from the usual options."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a friend.  Both ordered Paninis. One of us order the chicken breast and the other the turkey.  After we took a couple of bites, we realized we received the wrong orders. Orders were taken back and we had to wait approx another 15-20 min for our orders which again came out incorrectly.  Their turkey panini was just a few slices of deli turkey meat, with a few additional items added.  I don't want deli turkey meat on a sandwich when I am paying $9 for a sandwich.  Neither the chicken breast  or the turkey panini was worth the cost.  In addition, after getting our meals wrong 2x, no discount was offered.  Would not recommend.  In fact I have already told several to stay away from this location."}
{"text":"I visit Fountain Hills 3-4 times a week and I make it a point to eat here! This place is consistent and their Lasagna is amazing, all about the sauce!!! The service is great and the servers make you feel at home!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot as we have eaten here often. Food and service are always fabulous. I had to downgrade from 5 stars to 4.5 because we are customers who made reservations for a specific table a week in advance - was a special occassion. We got there on time only to find our table had been taken and all other window seats were taken. I was very dissapointed and left the restaurant. We have returned since with no issues."}
{"text":"You want italian cooking? You have come to the right place! Located in the shopping plaza that backs up against the famous fountain of fountain hills, plenty of parking. Beautiful decor inside and a great menu of authentic italian food! Papardelle Bolognese is delicious and a must try! Gnocchi pesto was on point if you are a pesto lover. Full bar with great happy hours but definitely stay for dinner. We have also had lunch twice and it's fantastic. The owner, Tony is so personable and comes by to check in on everything.   Decor is beautiful and take a walk outside to enjoy the fountain. Great food, reasonable pricing and i love the ambience!"}
{"text":"Awesome local Italian in the hills! Food was impeccable and service was top notch!!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Always have a great meal here!  My go-to for special occasions!  Seafood Risotto is amazing!  Friendly staff and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Fountain Hills! Great staff, amazing authentic Italian food, along with a wonderful atmosphere to be apart of!"}
{"text":"It's our absolute favorite restaurant and we are picky when it comes to Italian and this exceeded our expectations! Everyone that works there makes you feel like family"}
{"text":"Had a bowl of Lobster bisque  for lunch. Absolutely  awesome!  Would highly recommend.  As always, excellent  service, great staff!"}
{"text":"This is our second visit to the restaurant...both great experiences. The first time was a cold rainy night and service was great but restaurant was slow due to weather (go figure in Arizona).   Tonight was the tell tale sign of what to expect.  It was very busy...but we were so impressed that all staff helped each other.  It was a complete team effort and everyone made sure we were taken care of.  Lemon chicken was very good.  Salmon was also excellent.    Is it Italy?   No, but I don't expect that from a restaurant in small town Arizona  It is worth trying and also very much worth supporting this restaurant. Everyone tries hard and it is a pleasure to have this is our small town.    Great work folks. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Best service and food I have ever had in Fountain Hills. Food was amazing.  Waiter was fantastic."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Fountain Hills. I have never had a bad meal there. Happy Hour specials are great. Service is second to none, both at the bar and in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered Papardeelle Portofino which is a homemade pasta with shrimp, scallops, mussels in a very light but flavorful sauce. It was out of this world!! We had for dessert a Belgium Cheesecake that was amazing! Of course, our favorite wine Barbera. Eugene was fabulous as always and the owner, Angelo always treats us and everybody as family. We absolutely love this place. This is a Fountain Hills gem."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight. We had calamari as starter. I then had the clam linguine, my husband had the eggplant parmigiana and my daughter had chicken fingers as part of the kids' menu. My husband's entree was quite good. It was filling and tasty. My clam linguine was ok, abit too fishy for my taste. The chicken fingers and fries were quite salty (especially for kids). But overrall, the food was decent. We would come back and try other entrees.  I gave it three stars because the service was kind of rushing. The female server kept urging us to order food even though we already asked her to give us a few mins. While we were eating starter, our entrees came out. And we had been only sitting down for 10mins. Our server wasn't attentive either. She disappeared for the most parts.  Also, i wish happy hour was served in the main dining room. That would be sooo much better."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant in Fountain Hills. We went on Christmas Eve and were treated to a great dining experience and a fantastic meal. Just take your time and take it all in: great service, authentic Italian food, great atmosphere and good deserts. I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Took two tries to realize I'm never going back to this place again.   First time we went, just the wife and I, we stood in the entry for 15 minutes for nobody to acknowledge us. Place only had 3 filed tables so not busy. Staff on the floor would look our way and then look away.  Finally tried to ask one waitress to be rudely told to \"just wait, someone will be with you in a few minutes\" after almost 20 minutes we walked out.   Wife talked me into trying them out again.  Huge mistake.  This time it was the whole family, me and the wife and two adult kids.  We were at least meet promptly, better start.  Ordered the calimari appetizer, we received exactly 17 pieces that looked like puppy kibble.  17 midget chopped up pieces of what may have been squid?  For 10 bucks?.  No value there. The bread was warm and fresh however.  Dinner came and out of the 4 meals, only 2 were right.  Wife ordered the seafood pasta because it had shrimp and scallops... It came with no scallops and 2 shrimp. When she asked about it the waitress said \"yeah we're out of scallops\". Daughter ordered lobster ravioli since waitress said saffron sauce had no tomatoes.  She allergic to tomatoes.  Came with tomatoes. When we asked the waitress, \" their just garnish\". Really? So rude and dismissive.  I had the veil. Overall a good dish but I've had better sauce from a jar.  My son had the lamb. He was truly enjoying his meal.  The icing on the cake of our horrible experience was when the bus boy (Hispanic man) came and snatched it away from him while he was still eating. He had a lamb chop in his mouth when the guy swooped in and snatched the plate right out from under him and ran away. We were truly in shock at this amazingly rude action. We called the waitress over and she said \"he was probably going to box it up for you.\".  Truly stunned and saddened by this whole experience we just left.    We have lived in fountain hills for over 20 years and are always dining out as we work late and don't want to cook so we are so saddened when a place is this bad. Such a small town with only a few good options. This isn't one we will ever spend a dime at again."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this lovely Italian restaurant. Sat on the patio overlooking the lake on a picture perfect evening. Our waiter Eugene was attentive without hovering. The service was great and the food very good! Between the setting and the food, we had a wonderful experience at Arrivederci Cucina."}
{"text":"Took out of town guests here on a Friday evening. Everything was wonderful - service was attentive and quick, and food was exceptional.  Two of us had sea bass special which came with properly cooked vegetables and potatoes; sauce on the bass was really special. Eggplant parmesan and lemon chicken - dishes off the regular menu - were also good. Only issue was that the room got noisy as it began to fill up."}
{"text":"This is place has the best Italian food in Fountain Hills! Staff is friendly and welcoming. Food is fresh and delicious  I highly recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch before a theater show and must say they need to find the spice cabinet.  Service was really lacking and attention to detail wasn't there. Look for another place when your in fountain hills."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good a little pricey.  Definitely save room for Chocomisu.  The service is really slow though.  Although most of the waitstaff is really friendly, the bus boys seem not to have customer etiquette (not letting elderly pass first, bringing food to the table a couple times without placing the food down)  The veal marsala is a pretty small portion of meat so you should opt for the veal ossumbucco instead.Will be going back for sure when we know we have time."}
{"text":"The horrid service overrides anything good about this place. After being seated, it was 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us or took our drink order. No one checked in on us after taking our order... It would have been nice to have a second drink with dinner... we didn't even know they had specials until we were leaving... It took over 20 minutes for someone to run our card when paying..."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  They say they work with food allergies but that is far from the truth.  My girlfriend has many and when she got her food and it was not correct she asked to speak to the manager twice.  He never came. Finally the bus boy came to clean up the table and asked if we wanted any to go boxes she said no and that she wanted to speak with the manager (she had barely touched the food).  He was on the opposite side of the table from her and said I am the owner what you need, she said could you please come over here so I could talk to you he started to get rude to her and said well what do you need she said please can you come over here so I can talk to you he finally walked to the other side of the table only to be rude and disrespectful and blame her for the way her food was. When I told him that she is the patron and he should listen to her he yelled at us and told us to leave his restaurant.  Which we did.  He did not charge us.   I will never go back and will tell everyone to not bother going there."}
{"text":"Appealing menu with a nice variety of wines. Outstanding service and attractive dish with superb taste. Dinner for 2 is close enough to hear your neighbors entire conversation. Inviting bar with plenty of televisions. Appropriate pricing for the quality"}
{"text":"The lobster ravioli was DeLish.  The sauce was so rich and flavorful.  It was a small portion but just the right amount for me.  Myhusband had the lasagna which was also very good and saucy.  They even had some good beers where most Italian restaurants do not. He had the Left Hand Milk Stout.  Service was very prompt."}
{"text":"Chocomisu... it's been on my mind since I dined at another location but chocomisu wasn't available on the day I visited. I told myself someday I will come back to one of the restaurants to try chocomisu....  I came for early dinner but they were about a half full. They have nice wine list, mostly Italian and they are sold by a glass. Generous portion size, after two glasses, I was feeling good~.  I tried their today's special, grilled sea bass. Fish was cooked right, nice side dishes to compliment the main dish, I enjoyed my dinner. I tasted my friend's chicken pasta (can't remember what it was anymore) and I thought the sauce used for the pasta was pretty good.  And my main reason I came here, I was happy that they had chocomisu. Our server called it tiramisu but when it was served, they called it chocomisu. It taste like tiramisu and to be quite honest, I can't tell the difference between tiramisu and chocomisu. I guess it really doesn't matter as whatever it was, they were very good. Just right amount of mascarporn, it was easy to swallow the whole thing very quick.  I should watch out for my girly figure but once in a while, good to have yummy desert."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Fantastic service, great wait staff, AMAZING food and nice selection of wine and beer. It was my wife and I's anniversary and they brought out a special cannoli for free. They even made me chicken parmesan, which wasn't even on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, great bar and atmosphere. Perfect view of town fountain. Excellent food! Busy place so be patient as the ambiance, food and delight will be worth it. Great place to take guests or celebrate a special evening. Specials every night and luxe menu choice created by amazing chef. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This popped up on a search for gluten free restaurants and does offer GF pasta. Ended up eating an organic salad with grilled chicken that was dry and tasteless. Service was average. Patio view of the fountain was the highlight of today's lunch."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was packed in the heat of the summer when Fountain Hills usually slows to a crawl - I can see why. Great, professional service (thanks Eugene!), outstanding food. Another reviewer called it relaxed yet elegant - perfect description.  We started with the Arrancini (\"crispy Sicilian rice ball\") $6 and Potato Croquette $4 (four bucks!! When's the last time you saw a $4 appetizer??!), both very tasty. She had the Penne alla Norma $12 which was very good, I had the Ravioli Arragosta (lobster ravioli) $18 - spectacular. I've have a lot of lobster ravioli and this is by far the best I've had. Couple glasses of an Italian Cab that was very good  I thought the prices were reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food. We came away feeling like we'd had a nice dinner out.  I could go on. With all of the failed restaurants in this town it is so refreshing to see one that clearly knows what they're doing. The Italian owner was there also, not just shaking hands but working tables right alongside the waiters - clearly fully immersed in the business - this is how you do it. This truly is a case of \"if you build it (a great restaurant) they will come!\" They're just nine days in and Fountain Hills has already noticed. I imagine come fall reservations will be mandatory - to reiterate here in the slow season the bar and tables were full.  Congratulations Arrivederci, well done! A solid five stars, we'll be back, again and again."}
{"text":"Outstanding chicken piccata and wood fired pizza..friendly wonderful staff..will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm extremely picky when it comes to Italian food. Growing up outside Manhattan with an Italian heritage makes you develop high standards. This restaurant always delivers a great meal. My favs: penne ala vodka and the eggplant parmesan. The penne ala vodka has the perfect cream to marinara ratio. The pasta is always cooked al dente. The eggplant parm was rolled perfectly and stuffed with ricotta. Great service and atmosphere with outdoor seating. One of my favorite Italian restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"As a new comer to fountain hills I like to try all the restaurants. Arrivederci wasn't as tasteful as their look. The restaurant it's self was neat, clean, and friendly. However the special, freshly made lobster ravioli, lacked herbs of flavor.  The salmon on my salmon salad was nicely cooked. The hot vegetables on the fresh bed of greens, made for wilted lettuce to which I didn't get to enjoy my salad properly. Over all experience was okay."}
{"text":"This restaurant is top notch. Had a delightful dining experience the other night. The food was fabulous and the service was perfecto! Cannot wait to return"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant in Fountain Hills. Eugene is super. Almost didn't recommend it because I didn't want it to get to crowed selfishly."}
{"text":"We've been there two times now. Not sure we will return.  The food is okay.  Our waiter was great.  But here are the shortcomings that added to the bad vibe we felt on both occasions:  1) The hostess. She can never accommodate us.  We asked to sit by the window in a restaurant that was practically empty.  \"No,\" she said.  \"Too many reservations.\"  By the time we left, the restaurant was still empty.  Instead, she sat us at a big table in the middle of the room and then proceeded to split our table as we sat down.  So, if another couple came into the restaurant, they would have sat 2 inches from us? Say, what?  Two seconds later, our waiter put the table back together.  Totally weird.  2) You finish a dish and a millisecond later, the dish is taken away from your table.  It made us feel very rushed.  Again, why the rush? The place was hardly busy.  And, even if it was, thanks for making us feel rushed!  3) Other than the salads, I've yet to taste a dish that \"wowed\" me, although my husband loved the penne vodka.  I just thought it was okay.  Bottom line: ambiance inside the restaurant is okay.  Hostess could use some customer service training (Example: Is it that hard to say, \"Hello. Welcome.\"   Between Fountain Hills and Scottsdale, lots of restaurants to choose from. Not sure if we'll go out of our way to give this a third try.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Was in a party of 20. The server was overwhelmed, but handled the situation like a 'trooper'.  My wife had a couple of glasses of house wine which was priced at  $9/glass. Mind you, this is the 'house wine' which was Chianti. At those prices, the server should have recommended getting a bottle. My wife had the Veal Marsala, which she said wasn't worth $24 and came up short in taste. I had the Spaghetti and meat balls which was. decent @$15 but I thought the sauce was really thick. Wonder why you can't view the menu on Yelp?  Other sites where the menu is displayed, the prices are out of date."}
{"text":"After one visit I am sold on this place. I honestly can't imagine the food in Italy could be any better than this. We had an average size group and we all tasted each other's dishes, I would order everything again, and again. We are from Vegas but come to Phx about 3-4 times a year and I can promise you we will be back."}
{"text":"Food was below par.  The chicken parm had more breading than chicken. Views of the the fountain were nice, but food was def one star."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night. Very busy and a good kind of noisy. Our server was friendly enough and was sure to bring lemonade refills for my kids. The bread was good, soft and warm. My Chicken Limone was good...chicken was tender, just enough lemon zing. The pasta was what I could get from a box. My companions had the lasagna which they liked, but all 3 commented that it needed more red sauce. Another companion had the steak which she said was OK, but the shrimp in the shell that came with it freaked her out. We were seated near the wine chiller where servers/management tended to stand around and argue over the various bottles...not sure what was going on there. I would give it another try, my companions said they'd pass."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time, I leave completely satisfied! This little Italian place in Fountain Hills is a hidden gem! The atmosphere is quite pleasant with elegant tunes in the background. Our server, Eugene, was very attentive and accommodating as I am always thirsty - My glass was never empty which is a HUGE plus in my book. We ordered the Lasagna and Pasta Carbonara, and both dishes tasted great and portions were large as well. Before our food came out, we received a loaf of warm bread and a pesto oil spread! What an amazing touch as butter and/or olive oil are played out!  For dessert, we got a warm bread pudding with a dollop of vanilla ice cream - a perfect way to finish the meal.   All in all, if you're in the area and looking for a nice, tasty Italian meal, Arrivederci's is the place you should stop! (^__^)"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars mostly because it is the only place in Fountain Hills that serves decent food.  I had the chicken parmigiano and it was both delicious and we'll portioned. The service was excellent and my glass was always full.  For dessert we tried both the canoli and the tiramasu. Both were excellent and I believe they are made on premises."}
{"text":"We stopped here briefly after a V Day feast at another place and Arrivederci didn't disappoint. Leo hooked us up with Tiramisu that was out of this world.  The cappuccino was damn tasty also.  The creaminess of the filling engulfed my pallette on a fantastic journey of bliss. I swear I saw stars    Will return for dinner one day."}
{"text":"Painfully dull food.  Sorry.  There are way better Italian places nearby.  Try Marco's on 116th.  Or Sal's or Tesoro. The calamari was OK, the meat/cheese plate OK also.  The chicken I had with \"hot sausage\", so bland you could have fed it to a toddler.  Same with my husband's veal dish and the salmon.  The valley is bad enough, Fountain hills is worse for food. I had hopes. All these glowing reviews just shows show low the standards are here."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but came here with some friends the other day.  Boy from getting an amazing greeting to Emo the waiter being so friendly and welcoming, he definitely knows about customer service.   Everything was amazing from the pasta dishes to the artichoke app to the free bread pudding dessert.  Plus the breeze and the fountain helped as well.  We came in at 5pm and left at 9pm.  Everything was amazing, glad to see the new management is taking care of things the right way.   You feel like friend with EMO by the time you leave.  When you come make sure you get EMO as your waiter he is stop on the best"}
{"text":"I love this little spot, its hard to go anywhere else when I am in the area. Their chicken and sausage special is full of flavor, I asked for it over broccoli instead of pasta and they were happy to do it. Great salads and the best patio for enjoying the fountain when its nice out. Servers are always attentive!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here 3 times this week- the food is delicious, the ambience on the patio overlooking the fountain is perfect, service is excellent- if you're looking for Italian food in Fountain Hills this is your place"}
{"text":"My husband and I travel all over the country in a motor coach. Arrivederci Italian Restaurant is one of the best Italian restaurants we have come across. We're originally from Rochester, NY and still own an Italian restaurant there, so we know what we're talking about. Arrivederci is true old school Italian. My husband had their signature dish and I had the lasagna. We also shared a calamari fritti appetizer. You can also order their food from Grapeables wine bar next door and one time there we ordered their chicken parmesan. It was also excellent which made us come back and sit in the restaurant and eat. This was our first time in the restaurant and it did not disappoint. The ambiance is great. Mood lighting was perfect. Not too dark. For dessert we shared a generous piece of tiramisu. It was a chocolate tiramisu! And it was outstanding! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"When you combine fantastic truly Italian food with an amazing wait staff you have the absolutely best restaurant in az. Do not miss this opportunity to enjoy authentic Italian food in az."}
{"text":"We have only been there twice in two years. The food was as good the second time as the first. The waitress, not so much. No names needed ( Lee ) was not very friendly and did her job poorly.  Did not ask if we wanted an appetizer, did not ask if we would like a salad and I had to ask if there were any specials when she tried to take our order. Overall, not very attentive. My wife reminded me that the service was sketchy last time we were there as well."}
{"text":"Great food, service and ambience. We have been there a few times and are always excited to come back. The lobster ravioli is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Had the filet mignon stroganoff. The noodles and sauce were amazing. Would have preferred the filet to be served as medallions. This was more of a traditional ground beef/filet because the meat was sliced so thin. It was a little curled up. The acoustics are terrible in here if there is a large group, which there was. That could be remedied with some fabric blocks/rugs/whatever on the walls."}
{"text":"Nice place. Food was very good, nice wines and they pour a decent sized cocktail.  Service was good though with an almost full house (including some on the patio) a bit slow.  Wait staff helped each other...sign if good management.  Prices fairly high but quality also high. We (4) didn't order any appetizers so no critique there but all our meals were generous portioned and tasty.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We held our daughter's first communion party here on a Sunday evening, so not your standard dinner type review.  However, I can't say enough about how Guytano took care of us.  He created a menu that was perfect for 12 adults and 12 kids.  The service was lead by Eugene and he was perfectly on point.  We made it all a bit challenging for them by inviting a loud magician to entertain the kids during dinner as part of the party, but Eugene and his team worked right around it.  The food was excellent.  We all know how hard it is to find good Italian food in FH.  Arrivederci is by far the best I've tasted.  I started with the caesar salad (big portion and very fresh romaine) and then had the Chicken Limone.  It was tender and very tasty - a lot like picatta, but a bit more tangy.  Other guests enjoyed the cheese ravioli, spaghetti and meatball and salmon.   My older son asked for a special order of vodka penne pasta (no meat) and he said it was by far the best he's had in FH/Scottsdale.  Again, the staff accomodated every request.  The highlight, according to my friends, was the beef tenderloin in a porcini mushroom sauce.   We didn't try dessert because we brought a cake made special for the first communion.    The inside atmosphere is modern and roomy.  Not cramped.  They also have a nice patio for al fresco dining.  The menu pricing was reasonable for white tablecloth in FH.  Approximately $20/entree.  Some items more, some items less.  Portions were generous.  I look forward to going back with my wife and a small group so I can try the beef tenderloin and one of their desserts."}
{"text":"We visited Arrivederci in Fountain Hills on Saturday night. It was a nice evening and we saw heaters in the patio, so we chose to sit outside. Shortly after we were sat, the temperature started to drop. I asked the staff five times to turn on the heater, and nobody did or said anything. After a while, I stood up and asked the server to please turn the heater. He now announced that none of the six heaters outside have any gas. Wow. Are they for show? So we sat out in the cold, finished our appetizers and dinner in the cold. Dinner was uninspired and tasteless, but all we wanted to do is leave to a warm place. This place used to be good, but has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food. Wife and I hit this place for diner while passing they fountain hills and we were very impressed bb"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was perfect for dinner. The waiter was very attentive and gave his recommendations. We had the the Ravioli with Lobster, the pasta was made fresh and was very tasty."}
{"text":"Food was excellently prepared, staff were very friendly and helpful. The Caprese salad was delicious and fresh, and was aesthetically pleasing. All in all a wonderful meal, very filling, delightful, definitely will return. 10/10"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here with family aged 20-70. Friday night in March on the patio. Everyone enjoyed their meals. The pappardelle with seafood alla diablo wasn't especially spicy, and the mussels and scallops were perfectly cooked. The bolognese was very nice, sea bass delicious, and even the spag and meatballs satisfied. Very good lobster ravioli - nice pieces of aragosta, no mush here. Our server (Lee) was friendly and helpful, there when you needed her. Bottles of wine are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food. Great atmosphere as well. I had chicken Parmesan. It was fantastic the service was fantastic as well. One of the best restaurants in fountain Hills."}
{"text":"The cuisine is 5 star. Pollo Parmese was tender and flawless. Nicely plated, good portion for the money. Ciambotta Di Pollo E Salsiccia was very interesting. A lot of really nice flavors. Bread pudding for dessert was unique and not over-the-top like some can be.  Service on a quiet mid-week night was, candidly, a bit lacking. Server was aloof. Could have been more attentive and more polite. Points for offering dessert.  I like their T-bird location better. More upbeat, lively and friendly. Same great food. This location seemed very quiet and aloof which is nearly opposite the character of the T-Bird location.  But, for what's around Fountain Hills, I was really happy to see this restaurant there and would absolutely return."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Arrivederci. It's a nice place to bring my Grandma when I'm in town. This time, my 5 year old was with me and all she wanted was macaroni and cheese.  Well, the chef whipped up penne with provolone,  parmesan and freshly cracked pepper and she loved it! Between that and the chocolate gelato, she was a very happy kid. I had the sea bass which was very nice, the veggies were cooked firm, which I love. Grandma had the lasagna and she enjoyed it. To finish the meal, she had vanilla gelato and I had a cup of coffee, which was pretty good.  Honestly, the only complaint that I have (and it's not really a complaint) is that the lighting is very low and it tends to get noisy. Not a big deal for me, but it's hard for Grandma to read the menu and carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with a group of 6 it was vary good,almost all of us got the lemon chicken caper pasta it was vary good. Due to my daughter not wanting to be there I had to spend a lot of time outside with her. the staff was so nice checking with me if I need to sit outside or wanted me food to be heated up.  I would love to go there again but go early for dinner time I heard for some there's a 45min wait"}
{"text":"So the owner tells me not to write fake reviews.  I wish that it didn't happen. However this place was this bad. I have not returned,  and will not return.  No worries."}
{"text":"This restaurant has promise. We have had a shortage of genuine home made Italian in Fountain Hills, but it seems Arrivederci may change that.   The best word I could use to describe this place is genuine. The atmosphere, ambiance, and food are all reminiscent of the home cooked Italian food.   Check it out--it's a great place to go for a date or with family."}
{"text":"This authentic restaurant is a true gem to our Fountain Hills Community!  The food is beyond delicious!  Owners and staff are very friendly,  accommodating and professional!  Their goal is for you to leave coming back for more, hence the name of the restaurant! Arrivederci translates into \"we see each other again\"! With an experience like I've already indulged in many times already, you can't help but want to return! Arrivederci!"}
{"text":"This place is awful.  I had  Penne Norma which was an overcooked veggie stew.  Mushy eggplant. I think it was cooked a week ago and they heat it up on request. Some of the veggies were almost liquefied and not recognizable.  Other diner had salmon putenesca.  There was ONE caper in the sauce and one and a half olives.  Salmon serving a bit small.  Cost $22.  Yuck.  Our waiter was very good looking, when we saw him, which was about three times, which included giving us the bill. How come Italians forget how to cook when they come to America. If people would be more demanding on quality and service, places like this would probably improve. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! I had the Ravioli Caprese  and my husband had the Polpette al Franco. The Polpette was tender and their marinara sauce is some of the best I have ever had! To top it off, the wait staff is delightful and attentive!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian option.  Full menu.  Traditional contemporary Italian and European Style.   Menu selections offer great variety.  It's real quality and healthy prepared.  Great wine selection.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We had the surf & turf with scallops & mushroom risotto special.  Very good.  Pricy though.  I do hope that this makes it through the summer as it is an awesome restaurant.  Great service. Great food. Fancy atmosphere, fancy price.  The restaurant was packed for a Wednesday night. 2 house specials,  4 glasses of wine, 1 coffee. $100 + for dinner for two.   What more can a restaurant have?!"}
{"text":"Great service, good variety of menu options, and a nice wine selection.  The location is right in front of the Fountain, so this would be a great stop for someone visiting Fountain Hills, AZ.  They do get a little busy, so reservations may be a good idea."}
{"text":"As a San Diego native, I have frequented Arrivederci Cucina Italiana in both Hillcrest and near my Ranch San Diego home. I was so happy to see that they have followed me to Fountain Hills. I'm sorry, but Fountain Hills restaurants are not very good in general...until now.  Arrivederci is such a quality establishment and the food is so very fresh. My wife and I ordered the steak and mushroom risotto. Risotto is hard to nail but they do it to perfection. The risotto is creamy and filled with a variety of fresh mushrooms. The steaks were cooked as ordered and to perfection. They were so tender that I could cut mine with my fork. They were also seasoned perfectly.The meals came with a variety of fresh-baked bread and a fresh pesto dipping sauce. Considering the portions and the quality of meat, the prices are very reasonable.  The owner is so very kind and makes you feel like you are part of the family. Needless to say, we will be coming here often.   Finally...a REAL restaurant experience in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"I was craving Italian food after spending the day baking in the AZ sun at a Giants game. Good old Yelp hit it out of the park again!  We had the rice balls (I can't remember what they are called) to start and right away I knew this was going to be amazing as soon as I tasted the marinara that they were perched upon!  I had the carbonara pasta and it was so rich and decadent (in a good way, really good way). My hubby loved his lasagna which had some of that awesome red sauce on it. My daughter also loved her spaghetti with meat sauce.  This was probably some of the best Italian food I have eaten. EVER."}
{"text":"Had dinner there on Saturday, 7/5. I had the Seafood Risotto, my wife had the Salmon, and our friend had the Italian Whitefish, which was explained later to be seabass. The food was great; the service, not so much. Our water glasses stayed empty for the entire meal (even through dessert), and nobody even came by the table to ask how our meals were after we received them. Not a disaster, but we definitely felt neglected. We will definitely return based on the quality of the food, but we are hoping the service issues get resolved."}
