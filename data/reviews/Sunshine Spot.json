{"text":"Always wanted to try this place and got an incentive to do so with a buy 1 get 1 free meal coupon in mail.  The food was fresh and cooked to the way we instructed them  (i.e. Scrambled /not runny, salad instead of home fries).  Service was slow:  one wait staff and one cook on weekend a.m. and the place is a bit dingy but the food & service made up for it.  Had to order drinks to use the coupon.  We will come back without coupon."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on a Saturday. There was only one table seated when we got there. Service was pleasant but a little slow since there was only one cook. The food was decent but would've been nice if it came to us hot. Everything was lukewarm...  We ordered Big Big and California Benedict. Standard breakfast quality and the French toast that came with it was nice and eggy. The California Benedict had a nice balance between the ham and tomato.   Women's washroom toilet didn't flush and the spare stall was locked; I was forced to utilize the men's. I must say, the men's washroom was nicer!  It's probably best to go on a weekday when it's busier when they have more cooks. I'd give this place a second try."}
{"text":"A good alternative to Cora's - I prefer to come here when I don't want to wait for Cora's or know Cora's would be exceptionally busy. However, while its about a dollar or two cheaper than Cora's, the quality, decor, and service shows it.   The decor is dated and tired looking, the service is usually a bit slow (on an average day I always feel they have one less person than necessary), and the food is only so-so. It isn't bad but I would not crave their food at all. My bacon was very burnt and my eggs were a bit dry. The cup of juice is also very small, I could finish it in two gulps.   The breakfast place is right downstairs to a business building, I can see this would be a very popular spot during the weekdays."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for Brunch this morning - we actually initally intended to go to the Sunshine Spot near Bessarion Station, however, that one was completely packed (not a single space available in the parking lot, OR the parking lot beside it)  We ended up driving around and eventually found this Sunshine Spot location.  Walking in the restaurant, it was completely the opposite of the other Sunshine, there was only two other tables occupied! This location is in a small business building though, so I have a feeling a lot of the business they get would be 9-5ers in the building, or in the general area.  While our server was very friendly, service was a bit slow considering there were not many people to attend to, but the food was great! My boyfriend and I shared two of the meals - we had the \"Fruit Explosion Pancakes\" which had strawberries, blueberries, and bananas inside. Deeelicious. Light & fluffy and the fruit was extremely fresh! Often times at diners I find the fruit can be a bit soggy or not quite as fresh, but this was not the case here. We also had a fruit salad that reinforced the point that the fruit was nice & fresh :).  The other meal we had was the Hungry Man Breakfast. Complete with: bacon, peameal bacon, ham, sausages, 3 eggs, and your choice of two pancakes or one piece of french toast. Again, the food was so nice & fresh - and really just cooked to perfection. I've been to a few places lately where the French Toast batter was a bit lacking, but here it was the perfect amount of batter - not too little so the batter gets lost, or not too much where it weighs down the toast.  All in all, a great place to venture to if you're craving some diner breakfast/brunch. We will most certainly be back :-)."}
