{"text":"We were in the area on a Saturday night and stopped in. We got a great corner booth right away, no waiting. Our waiter, Adam, was very well versed on all items on the menu that we asked him about and he was also quite knowledgeable with the various wines they offered. His service was top notch. The food was very good, we could not find fault with anything we ordered. The California Roll appetizer was excellent. Our scallops were perfectly cooked and all of the sides were very good also. We will definitely go back when we're in the area again."}
{"text":"AWESOME sherry crab bisque, filet, crab cakes and creamed spinach! Attentive staff as well."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good...but service was not at all...and if spending $100 pp on a night out then I'd go somewhere else...no one brought over bread, asked for pepper on my salad, or asked how my steak was cooked...these are basic questions asked when you go to a diner...not worth the money unless they hire steakhouse servers..."}
{"text":"Went to this place randomly, not really knowing what it was.  Everything was very good!   I had a medium cooked New York strip that was done perfectly and a side of mushroom risotto that was absolutely amazing.   Amy had a filet topped with crab meat and covered in a veal gravy that was delicious as well.   The atmosphere was cozy and the prices were a little high, but over all it was a good experience."}
{"text":"The food was very good...just not as good as some other steakhouses in this class.   I was little disappointed with the lobster bisque.  It was actually on the cool side.  I wish I would have tried \"Mike's\" salad instead of opting for the bisque (guess that makes it an easy choice next time).  No regrets in ordering the filet and the sides were large enough to share.   I thought the staff was much friendlier than most.  Especially considering one in our party was late (we had reservations) due to not knowing the area.  They were casual and didn't try to act \"uppity\" as one may experience in other higher priced eating establishments.  Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"This is the second time I came to this restaurant.  Without a reservation we were seated at a booth in the bar.  The waitress in a sleeveless dress would shiver every time the front door opens.  This place is good for steak but I had the Maryland crab cakes.  Not quite like G and M's in Baltimore but not bad.  The other two guys had steak and ribs.  The rib plate was huge.  We had a very nice bottle of '03 Truchard merlot.  After dinner, we had a glass of MacCallan and Dalwhinnie single malts."}
{"text":"I tried the Rib Eye. It was dry, tuff and hard to cut. I did not have enough to send it back. I should have. I have picked up a 20oz. rib eye at Wal-Mart, cook it on an iron pan that was better."}
{"text":"I was not impressed but the service here. The tables are wonky and they don't do anything about it especially when you ask. The water cup was leaning on the table and apparently they use some foam to top their their tables which doesn't balance things well. Anyway, we asked the waiter to see f we can use a coaster or something to prop the water glass up and he said 'no one complains about it only kids do'. This was extremely offensive. Why not just acknowledge the problem and go find a coaster or something. The water glass was legit about to fall over and he moved it to place it on the side dish. Now we had to ask for more side dishes. What a waste of time. The food  was okay nothing special. Their vegetarian option wasn't even on the menu. I felt embarrassed asking for a veggi meal and the waiter did not help with making me feel better. His tone was hard and not accommodating. Also - it felt like they were forcing us to buy drinks to crank up the bill. Lastly, the table was not cleared when we got the check. I found this to be very rude."}
{"text":"This was the perfect restaurant. Went there for my Birthday with my family. The staff was great. When they sat us near the kitchen and we asked to move the request was accommodated without hesitance. We ordered the pot roast nachos and they were delicious. I had the fullback filet oscar style. The steak was cooked perfectly to the medium rare that I asked for. The crab meat and oscar sauce were amazing. The desert I ordered was the peanut butter pie which was great. GREAT FOOD GREAT STAFF GREAT PLACE"}
{"text":"I rarely do reviews, but tonight's meal was exceptional. The filet and smashed red skins were stellar.   My only complaint is that it took a while for the waiter to show up when we arrived, but the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Very consistent service and food and very good.  Some of the best steak around along with great burgers.  Pot roast nachos are mandatory.  The appetizer burgers are great as are the sides, in particular the lobster mac and cheese.  They also handle reservations quite well, better than others around."}
{"text":"Took my family here for dinner. WOW, great experience. From start to finish, an incredible dining experience. Calamari appetizer was off the charts delicious. Can't wait to go back. Money and time well spent. Also, wait staff is spot on, great job."}
{"text":"I often heard about this restaurant and wanted to try it.  I took amy daughter and my grandaugte (9 mos.) for lunch.  This restaurant was definitely business lunch inclined, but we were treated like royalty - attentive server - not hovering.  Everything was explained to us and special attention was given to a food choice we made for my grandaugher.  Although pricey, I would always choose this restaurant for a special night out."}
{"text":"Underwhelming at best. Nothing special about this place. Service was completely impersonal--from the hostess to the waiter. Food was what I could get elsewhere and it would be a better experience and less expensive. In a sound: meh."}
{"text":"This was our 4th and most pleasant visit to Ditka's. While every visit has met our expectations, Greg - our waiter today - was such a pleasure to talk to. Greg was very knowledgeable about the menu and suggested a dessert that we fell in love with - pumpkin cheesecake. Greg - thank you for making our day. We look forward to our next meal at Ditka's - we'll be sure to ask for you."}
{"text":"Solid place for lunch.   Salads are a good size not to big not to small. Service was excellent   Plan on enjoying Ditka s on your way to or from the Pittsburgh airport. Wine list is good not   oh and the soups are great.  I had the turkey chilli.  What would win in a fight?  Ditka or a Grizzly bear?   DITKA!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but boy the service was glacially slow! We ordered two salads and sandwiches and it took nearly an hour before we got out burgers. Our waiter was lackadaisical at best. Our salads were very fresh and tasty and the bisque was excellent, but I would never opt to eat there unless I have lots of time on my hands."}
{"text":"Service \"Tyler\" was fantastic as far as information. Checking back to see how things are or to print a receipt  not so much. Burgers were ok. Strip steak was pillowy, med rare as I said was pillowy. Not impressed. Chicago was much better."}
{"text":"Stayed overnight nearby and someone recommended Ditka's.  I was impressed that it was \"upscale\" although I was seated at a small table in the bar area and it was very loud.  Service was superb - quick, never had to wait to order or to receive my order...almost too fast.  The food (crab bisque (yummy and hot), steak (rare) with crabmeat and asparagus, ending with recommended spearmint cheesecake.  Had a martini to start, a glass of red with the meat, and a grand mariner with dessert.  I was satisfied with quantity and quality of food.  The total tab with tip for one person was $122...which I thought was a tad high.  But, overall, I enjoyed my meal, with attentive service and perfectly prepared food and drink.  Getting to this establishment is a bit of a challenge...I ended up cutting through a couple parking lots to get to it.  If you're in this area, I recommend Ditka's for a fine dining experience.  Although the place was \"packed,\" I was seated immediately (was advised a 20=min wait if I wanted a table other than the bar area, which, as I mentioned was quite noisy."}
{"text":"I cannot think of anything that could have been better. Had the pork chop - it was perfection. Geat bottle of wine. Service was excellent. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Food is great...love the steak. Crab cakes are huge and the service is decent. However, the bar staff pays little attention to the crowd in front of them. Couldn't make eye contact once for a drink before dinner. Hostess seated many people with the same reservation time as us long after we arrived. Not a good experience, might be my last time there."}
{"text":"Made reservations at Ditkas because it was one of the only quality steakhouses in the Pittsburgh area with tables available same day.  The atmosphere is nice and somewhat dimly lit.  Our server was friendly and helpful.  We ordered the strip steak, pork chop, mac and cheese, asparagus,  and red skinned potatoes.   The steak and potatoes were very tasty.  The asparagus was average and the mac and cheese was bland and tasteless.   The most disappointing dish was the pork chop.  It looked impressive stood up on end and served with a cherry reduction.  The taste was horrendous.  It tasted more like an old cured ham than a pork chop.  Overall Ditkas disappointed.  The steak, while better than the cheap Outback-style steakhouses was not quite on par with Capitol Grill, Hyde Park, or Mortons."}
{"text":"So I want to give 4 1/2 stars but we can't. Last night I had a poor review experience and tonight completely opposite.  First of all Lance and Sandy, I ate at the bar with a client. They were beyond professional and so friendly. They both asked my name and shook my hand...outstanding! Introduced us to others dining at the bar and we all became friends. So much fun! Met Roger from NC and bought him a glass of wine and he bought my second!   So food.. well done presentation and cooking, my oysters, salad and prime rib were excellent. My guest loved his meal as well. While the meal was 4 stars ...service was 5. I feel like I joined a family ...can't wait to return, with my guest and see Roger, Sandy and Lance!!"}
{"text":"I went for my birthday dinner and it the best meal I've ever had. When my steak came out and it was over cooked the waiter took it away with no hesitation.  He brought me a appetizer to eat until my new steak would be done. When the bill came not only did he not add the appetizer but he had comp'd the rest off the meal and told us \" if you have room let me know what dessert you would like or if your full let me know what dessert I can pack for you.\" That extended to my whole table. Great food. Great service."}
{"text":"Definitely a three star place.  We had the coffee rubbed steaks and they were interesting (good).  The filet mignon was second rate.  All of the sides were bland and average.  The place seemed chaotic.  Our server tried but needed more training.  The hostess seemed surprised that people came to the door.  Desserts were average and drinks were average.  I don't mind spending $80.00 for a meal, but it needs to be up to the price.  Nothing interesting about the place.  Way, way, way over priced.  For the money, there are dozens of places in Pittsburgh that are much better."}
{"text":"Incredible food and drinks.  Very pricey but is a great place for that once or twice a year special night out.  On par or better than Ruth's Chris,. In my opinion."}
{"text":"Huuuuuuuuge disappointment !!! Hosted a private event for 16 guests. I was given a choice of several dinner packages ranging from $47 and up to close to $100 per person.  I selected a lower end package keeping within budget. We were served a salad which was a plate of iceburg lettuce and nothing added to it, a filet, mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables (asparagus). The filet was waaaaay over cooked, the mashed potatoes were boring and dry and the asparagus had zero flavor, seasoning or sauce. Since we were looking for a sreakhouse, sadly Outback would have been a better option. Much more quality meal than what was served at Ditkas. PS: The triple chocolate was no show stopper either.... Basically a dried out etamins cake. Paid a hefty price for a bland and boring meal.  No thank you."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on the way to the airport. Not impressed at all. The chicken salad was overpriced and was nothing special. Will not return here."}
{"text":"We flew into PIT that evening and had dinner at Ditka's. The staff was very friendly and helpful - very professional while not being stuffy. Food recommendations were useful. And the food was good: the stir fry veggies were excellent, the oyesters were outstanding, and steak was delicious. Risotto isn't my favorite, so my not loving it might just be personal taste.   I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good meal between Pittsburgh and the airport. Or as an alternate to downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Gave 4 stars because of the great seafood selection which was available for a steakhouse.  Had a great server and great petite filet with blue cheese crust.  My date had a bone in filet with garlic crust.  The only downside was the ambiance.  The jazz music playing was a little too \"nose in the air\" for me.  If back in the Pittsburgh area again I would definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Great steaks!. The side potato is Ditka size! Of course the steaks are expensive, but they are very good. So good that even the filet mignon my wife ordered well-done was still very tender and full of flavor (I am a rare steak fan so that is saying a lot)  They have a great lunch menu with items pretty much the same price as Red Robin, but much much better quality. The burgers are very tasty, and their ribs are awesome. I also liked their fries. The staff is also very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"NY strip was ridiculously delicious! Perfectly glazed, with flavors in every bite.    Pecan marble cheesecake, WOW!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered twin medium rare fillets and crab cakes. Without a doubt one of the best meals I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"If you don't want to travel into the city from the South or West side of Pittsburgh, maybe you'd choose Ditka's. It's not that our experience was bad, but it doesn't rank high on our list for a steakhouse. Compare it to any other suburban steakhouse, like Outback, and it wins hands down, but if you're expecting the caliber of a Ruth's Chris or Morton's, you should brave the traffic and tunnel and visit the real deal.   The calamari appetizer was delish, according to my husband, the calamari aficionado. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned well. The oysters on the half shell were fresh and meaty with both cocktail and horseradish sauces. The Filet Oscar was so-so, a little overdone and it needed some additional seasoning to spruce it up. It was accompanied by some rather skinny and limp asparagus with a boring Bearnaise sauce. My pan seared scallops were a little overdone and came with only four small scallops. On the other hand, the mushroom risotto that came with it was very tasty.  Desserts were fair. The cappuccino was cold with no froth so we had to send it back. The replacements were hot, but not up to snuff either.  I have to admit that service was very good.  Our server realized that we hadn't seen each other in a long time so she gave us ample time to gab and peruse the menu. They didn't rush us through our meal, and let us linger at our table as they began to close the dining room down."}
{"text":"We went here for a date night because we've heard such rave reviews about the steak here.  We left completely disappointed.  The service was fine, but nothing better than you'd at a lower priced steakhouse.  The tuna appetizer wasn't good.  I loved my salad, but my husband barely touched his and the waitress just took it away without asking if anything was wrong with it.  The steak was fine, but nothing spectacular.  It wasn't worth the money we spent.  We've eaten at some amazing steakhouses and this was surely not one of them."}
{"text":"This is overall the best restaurant in Robinson...  It may be a little ahead of its time for some Pittsburghers who are set in there ways...  Good service, great atmosphere, good wine, and good food..."}
{"text":"Nine of us had dinner on a weekday. We sat at the bar at high top tables pulled together. It was comfortable and easy to chat despite the TVs. Service was by Christina and her coworker. They were very attentive and we enjoyed.  For appetizers, we all split calamari (x2), nachos, and bruschetta (x2). It was a good amount of food and there were leftovers. The calamari was hot and crisp. The bruschetta consisted of triangles of bread with cheese melted in top and a bowl of chopped flavored tomatoes.  It was good. The nachos had a lot of jalapeños And were very meaty. They were a heavy appetizer to eat before a big steak.  My Caesar salad was tasty. The lettuce was chopped in small bite sized pieces and the dressing was good. There was a lot of cheese. I liked the garlic croutons which was surprising since I usually order it without croutons. But I forgot. I would order this again. The filet was perfectly cooked medium rare and melted in my mouth. The blue cheese on top was not shy! The mac and cheese side dish was good. Broccoli too. I didn't try the potatoes (jalapeo hash browns) but everyone raved about them. We skipped dessert."}
{"text":"Pretty solid establishment. Exquisite food and professional service by Geoffery. Nachos were filling. My burger was a little overcooked but not to the point I felt the need to send it back. My fathers filet was fantastic topped with a crab cake. My father thought the fish tacos were amazing (yes we eat a lot) more local craft selections would be something I recommend in this establishment."}
{"text":"You definitely get what you pay for here. Three words to remember: Pot Roast Nachos!! You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"I organized a business lunch here since it was close to our customer's office.  They are unable to seat more than 8 people in the dining room so our options were the bar or a private room.  Thankfully it was not too loud in the bar but the service was slow.  We put in our orders and it seemed to take a while before any of the food showed up.  My salad with salmon was pretty good - nothing remarkable.  Apparently the steaks and other entrees are their strong suit.  The prices were reasonable and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  I think I would need to visit again for supper to truly evaluate this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere a little pricey but that was expected food was good had broiled salmon. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I'm in the middle of an allergy elimination diet, so dining out can be a total bummer temporarily. When I was invited to Ditka's for a rehearsal dinner lately, I thought \"What the hell? I'll call and see if I should just eat before or if there would be something for me to eat that night.\" Enter Chef Adam and the serving staff that night! Not only did he listen closely to my concerns, but he made sure I had something to nosh on during every course that was DELICIOUS! It was customer service far beyond what I could've expected. Thank you for making me feel welcomed...and full."}
{"text":"Ditka's was great but Da Coach was not there.  I ate here for the first time the other and was very pleasantly surprised.  We started out at the bar and they do not have too many beers on tap, but they did have Yuengling and Sam Adams Octoberfest.  I was pleased to see both of those on tap.  We had to wait a bit for a table, but it wasn't too long.    Our table started out with an order of the bruschetta for an appetizer.  It was a slightly different bruschetta as the bread had melted cheese and it was drizzled with a balsamic dressing.  I'm not the biggest bruschetta fan, but this was decent.  I also ordered a caesar salad pre-meal.  I'm a huge fan of having a salad pre-steak because I feel like it almost cleanses the palate.  The caesar salad itself was nothing spectacular.  In fact, it was pretty ordinary.  Very similar to what a lot of chain restaurants to serve.    They've got a great menu.  I knew going in I was going to order a steak, but I wasn't sure which cut I was going to get.  I was deciding between their 10 oz Filet, the 16oz NY Strip and the Ribeye.  I decided on the Strip and ordered it medium rare.  We also ordered some sides for the table.  As an FYI, all the sides are served a la carte.  We went with some mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and asparagus.  I must say that the potatoes were very good, but the star of the sides was the creamed spinach.  It was completely over the top awesome and even came with some melted cheese on top which made it phenomenal.  I would highly recommend ordering the creamed spinach.  You will not be disappointed.  I was then served my steak - it was pretty freakin' awesome.  It was cooked absolutely perfectly medium rare.  It was incredibly tender and incredibly flavorful.  It was easily one of the better steaks that I've had in a long time.  I devoured it.  There was almost no fat on it which made it even better.  I also tried some of the Ditka's house steak sauce and that was very good, as well.  I know you're not supposed to use a lot of steak sauce on a fine steak, but I like adding a bit to kick the flavor up a notch.    Then...we ordered some dessert.  They had a pumpkin cheesecake and that is one of my all time favorite desserts so my mind was easily made up.  It was very good - and it was served as a circular piece which was different.  I'd recommend this also.  Overall, it was a very good meal.  Service was very good and it's priced accordingly for a fine steakhouse.  In my mind, the apps and salad are probably the only two things that prevented me from giving this place a 5-star rating.  If I'm back in the area and craving a steak, I'd have absolutely no problem coming back here."}
{"text":"Service: 4 stars  Food: 4 stars Value: 4 stars  I really liked the looks of this place when I drove by it on my way to my hotel. It called out to me. Much like any other 11 year old boy in 1984 hailing from the Midwest, Mike Ditka was the closest thing to god like status that any of us knew and he's been a part of my Sunday's ever since - either as a coach or commentator. So I really had no choice. This place chose me through divine inspiration.   I came in after a long 1 stop flight with crying babies and pissed off DINKS, which landed me in Pittsburgh. And I arrived hungry!   I entered Ditka's and was greeted by a courteous hostess and proceeded to bar area. Tabletops are walk in service and you just seat yourself. There are TVs in the bar area and they had on Game 3 of the MLB playoffs between St. Louis and Da'Cubs.  The Cubs were smacking it to the Cards pretty hard so despite being in Pittsburgh, the crowd respected Pittsburgh born Ditka's second home, Chicago, and let out many cheers and applauds. In my opinion, Ditka's is very much a gentleman's steakhouse, but with the class that a lady can be with her man and feel respected. The atmosphere is dimly lit candle light tables and the decor is dark wood and leather.    After I sipped a much needed beer (Yuengling, of course). I looked over the menu which was pretty impressive. This place has it all and I was pretty impressed with the price point considering the type of food that was offered. I am a pork chop lover and they had one that I saw served next to me, and I knew I had to try it.  It was a Double cut Berkshire with a spiced Apple chutney and mashed sweet potatoes.  I ordered mine to temp (medium). When it was served to me I cut into the center and instantly knew it he been overcooked. I tried it just to be sure and it was definitely well done. The server came over and asked if everything was ok. I politely told her it was overcooked.  She looked at it, and without even the slightest negativity, kindly apologize and said she would be back with a properly cooked order.  I continued watching the game and a few minutes later she reappeared with a new plate, and this time it was cooked perfectly.  I devoured this and was very happy for speaking up, because I was looking at a years worth of TMJ therapy had tried to chew the first one they sent out.  Mistakes will always happen but it's how a restaurant honors those mistakes that define them.   Ditka's is a solid place and I hope to be back one day."}
{"text":"Dined there tonight. Service good. Steak was extremist tough. Very low quality meat. Ordered a Delmonico and could not identify is as such. Extremely pricey for the lack of quality."}
{"text":"In the hospitality industry the first three priorities are service, courteousness and a welcoming demeanor. Despite the good being delicious, and the wine selections being good, I felt I was missing something. I personally feel there is a lot if \"scope for improvement\"as far as service is concerned. Almost felt a kind of \"you are fortunate to be here\" ambience!"}
{"text":"My wife took me here for my birthday as I LOVE steak.  Cameron was our waiter and he was outstanding. I couldn't' t ask for better service. We started off with a couple cocktails. I had the Pomegranate Martini and my wife took Cameron's recommendation and tried the Strawberry Daiquiri. She said it was the best one she ever had.  For our meals she had the Chicken Madeira and I had the Surf and Turf. ( Fillet Mignon with a Lobster Tail. You can add a huge cup of crab meat to top you steak for only $5, which I did of course! I had the mac and cheese as my side and she had a wedge salad. My steak was cooked to perfection and the mac and cheese was spectacular! The wife thoroughly enjoyed her food as well.  Our daughter had her usual cheeseburger which she absolutely loved. Big shocker there! LOL!  Upon finishing our meals I was presented with a birthday dessert. A wonderful warm chocolate cake topped with vanilla ice cream. It was so so good. We all left completely stuffed.   While Ditka's is a very good restaurant. I still prefer Morton's for the price."}
{"text":"Great place. Had the 8 oz filet with mashed potatoes and asparagus . Cooked perfectly. Service was attentive and service was nicely paced. Would recommend this place for anyone local or visiting the area"}
{"text":"Had a 3 hour layover in Pittsburgh and gave this restaurant a try.  Crab cakes and burger were delicious.  And...Maria and Malcolm were very customer service centered!  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Ditka's for our 30th wedding anniversary.  We had heard so many wonderful things about this place. First off the service was excellent! Unfortunately my prime rib was so bland and mealy. My husband seemed to enjoy his dinner but it was nothing to write home about. I guess we were expecting to have our socks knocked off but had an average, very expensive dinner that we could have gotten at Applebee's for 1/4 of the price. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Fantastic steak, great staff.  Nice experience.  Love Ditkas."}
{"text":"This is a review for the Ditka's in Wexford on route 19, recently purchased the old Atria's.    This gets 2 stars, primarily based on any non-domestic draft being $7 or more.  Seriously Ditka, maybe go on ESPN once or twice if you need some mad money rather than making the decision to choose any other run of the mill \"American seafood, steakhouse\" over yours, so simple.  The food is meh, but the low review is due to the price gouging on alcohol more than anything.  It would have received 1 star if not for the admirable service.  My friend and I walked in near close, yet the manager and waiter were happy to serve us.  Just because you used to play in the NFL, doesn't mean you get to charge stadium prices for \"craft beer\" like Sam Adams.  Unlike the Chicago Bears of 2016, I will not be returning for any more punishment."}
{"text":"Just like da bears, this place stands out for da win. Atrias, the former occupant, used to be my goto for dates when I was around 18. After they left, I had heard this place was overpriced and not worth the effort, boy was I wrong!  I came here for a lunch on a Sunday, they were not very busy as at all, few guests rolling in.  We were greeted immediately and given our choice of seating, we chose a booth and sat down to look at the menus. Our waiter can a moment later, pleasant and friendly ready to get our drinks and made some recommendations. We decided on a bowl of crab bisque to start, I got the prime rib sandwhich and my companion got a salmon salad.    My first thought as I took a bit of my bisque, which arrived in minutes, very hot, is I immediately regretted not getting the larger portion. My usual main complaint about bisque is it's too thick like a paste or too runny like a broth. This was rich, creamy and seasoned to perfection, and some of the freshest crab I've had in the burgh. The second I put my spoon down and pushed my bowl to the end of the table, the waiter was on the way with our entrees.  My prime sandwich was perfect and I could see why it was such a popular item, mouthwatering, I'd highly recommend this.  As for the salmon salad, I have never tasted a salmon so crispy and full of flavor in my life, I'm not sure if this was flash fried or fully fried, but wow, just wow. Our only complaint was all the salad was drenched in dressing, a good one, but a little much, made it a very unhealthy salad.  Overall, amazing lunch, food was great and service did it justice. I will be back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Prime rib came exactly as requested and was very flavorful. The house salad was delicious but less dressing would have been better. The wine and the mohito were exactly as described and a generous amount. It had a quiet atmosphere despite the sports tv everywhere. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Took Mom and my lovely wife out to celebrate Moms 81st birthday. Woman that took us to our table had no personality. Not s good first impression. Our waiter Tyler was was awesome. Food was excellent. The drunk people outside the front door left a bad taste in our mouth though. Abusive, drunk and smelled like MJ . Called the manager from our car to complain. Ugh. Probably should not have served sloppy drunk people.  You still get 4 stars though. Expensive but worth it. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Used to be my \"go-to\" steak house in Pittsburgh.  Didn't get served because my friend ordered a full martini instead of half a glass.  I had one drink and they said I was \"over-served.\"  The restaurant was 15% full and could use the business.  Our waitress was astonished that the Manager came to our table.  Fully understand why the restaurant was nearly empty.  Mike, you hire snowflake Managers and your customers will melt away.  Never again."}
{"text":"So as I sit in a shaded 1970s booth my stomach crimping with pain and nausea from a horrendous dinner. Is this reality? Or am I trapped in yet another food poisoning nightmare...I have only myself to blame for this disgusting sickening feeling I have right now. My hands clinge to my stomach my diaphragm feels with polluted air of musty 70s and the thought of anything other than just getting to my car without vomiting in this wannabe upscale shithole. It's ashame that 8-10yrs ago this place was so fantastic. But there's no secret here whenever you go to use the restroom and there's a line out the door waiting to unleash a diarrhea explosion from disgusting, dirty food most likely prepared by the Mexican dishwasher. I am seriously so sick right now it's unreal. It's hard for me to even continue to finish this review so I'm actually going to stop writing right now. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! STAY FAR AWAY!!"}
{"text":"I ate at Ditkas for the second time in mid-September.  I had eaten there a few years ago with my wife and a few other couples.  I must say the food was outstanding this visit.  My friend and I had made a 5:30 reservation and were promptly seated.  Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing.  I had a mixed drink and my friend had wine.  For the most part, everything is pretty much ala carte.  I ordered a 16 ounce prime rib with red skin potatoes.  It came with bread.  The prime rib was flawless.  Great cut, fantastic taste.  Potatoes were very good as well.  As others have indicated, Ditkas can get expensive. Probably a little expensive for the location.  Certainly worth a special occasion.  I would definitely return if I am craving a good steak."}
{"text":"Ditka's is a wonderful steakhouse located in Robinson. Our meal was fabulous and the service was, too! Steaks were all cooked properly, and the fine dining experience was exactly what I'd hoped for. I tried their famous crab bisque and I only wish I'd gotten a bowl instead of a cup! It's a definite must-try when you go. Their turtle dessert is also incredible, and a shot of espresso rounded out the meal perfectly. I'd recommend to anyone! They menu also offers a variety of seafood and burgers if steak isn't you're favorite options!"}
{"text":"Food here was great. Service was turrible.   We came here after getting back from vacation. We were on the way home and decided to stop and avoid rush hour, but neither of us was too hungry. So, we ordered soup and salad. Then, everything went down hill.  As we ordered the waitress sighed, rolled her eyes, and basically never came back again. Now, I understand that you want people to order dinner, so you can make a better tip, but seriously effe you. She was so rude. I could not believe it. We didn't even get to order drinks, because she never came back. WTF?"}
{"text":"Had the Bone-in Ribeye. It was better than Hyde Park, Ruth Chris.. and it wasn't close."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our steaks and the  service was excellent.  They asked if we were celebrating a special ooccasion and since it was my birthday i got a card from the staff and a free desert."}
{"text":"Ditka's had the worst customer service Sunday night that I have experienced at a \"high end\" steakhouse. We made an 8:30 reservation for a party of 7. When the reservation was made we were not told that they closed at 9pm. In my experience when a restaurant closes at a certain time such as 9 that means they stop seating guest at that time but they continue to serve the guest that have been sat. Not at this restaurant. Nothing was said to us as about the closing time as we ordered two nice bottles of wine and a seafood appetizer but as we were eating the appetizer our waiter came to the table and said that the restaurant closes at 9 and that they send the bartended home at 9:15 so it was last call.   We asked to speak to the manager because we had not even ordered dinner yet and felt like we should be able to continue to order drinks with our meal. While waiting for the manager the chef walked over to our table and asked if we were going to be ordering dinner because he had \"payroll in the kitchen that he was running up\". This is a 2 hour type restaurant so it is completely unreasonable for them to seat a party at 8:30 and expect them to be gone by 9 or even to necessarily have ordered by 9.   When the manager came over he offered no apology or resolution other than to go ahead and order any drinks we would like before the bartender left. This was unacceptable and as he walked away he was laughing and joking with the chef about it. At this point we paid for our appetizer and drinks and left. This is not the way a nice restaurant should treat their guest. The one high point was our waiter. He was obviously embarrassed by the way the management handled the situation. He was very apologetic and could not have been nicer even though he was losing out on at least a $300 tip.   On there website they state \"Ditka's Hospitality is what makes Ditka's a special place. The goal of our restaurant's staff is simply \"to have the guest want to return.\" They do this by making people feel welcome and cared for all the while looking for opportunities to create a \"Ditka's Experience.\"  They failed living up to this goal Sunday night. We were obviously an inconvenience to them and not welcome."}
{"text":"Calamari are excellent! Service is s l o w. Bisque is delicious. A guy place. Great for company budget."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is a little pricey came here on Wendesday around 7 and the place was packed, luckily we got a table even though we didn't have a reservation. This place has a cool decor, dark and elegant. Before I even sat down I was impressed by the service, I asked an employee where the bathroom was and they walked me to it.   So what did I eat? Started of with the calamari and it was seriously amazing, they were perfectly crispy and had finely chopped peppers on top, definitely a must try. Had to go with a steak sense I was at Ditka's so I went with the 10 oz steak and it was perfectly crispy on the outside and I had the twice baked potato that was gigantic seriously the size of a small baby. The potato was topped of with cheese and the inside was creamy and delicious . Of course I ordered my steak medium rare, I was a little disappointed that my steak wasn't bloody enough, but the second half was pinker. To top it off had a couple Sam Adam's October Fest beers, good times."}
{"text":"I am in town for a girls weekend. After having an amazing time at the Bucs game we were hungry. I got the number from the front desk, who highly recommended them.   I called at 12:30, a man answered and just said \"hello Milanos, we're closed\" and then hung up on me. They didn't close till 1am. I called back and the man did the same thing but I stopped him half way through his rant.   WAYNE is the most disrespectful person I've had the \"pleasure\" to speak to. I've been in the service industry for 12 years and I would have been fired for the way he spoke to me.   Needless to say I will not be going back, and I informed my hotel guest services as well to not recommend them."}
{"text":"Ditkas is a very good steak house!!  Maybe not at the level of Mortons or Capitol Grill but non the less very solid!"}
{"text":"I got dragged here on a business meeting and it literally was the MOST bland, boring restaurant I have ever been to.  Their menu had literally, like, 3 options, very plain things like chicken breast, pork chop....I don't even remember.  It was totally lame.  I guess boring suits like it."}
{"text":"Not super impressed. I made a reservation here for a business lunch and specifically wrote in the notes of the reservation via open table that I preferred a quiet table that was perhaps more secluded. No mention was made of this upon arrival and we were seated at a table right in the middle of the main dining area.   I think our waiter forgot about us when it was time to order. Even though we were chatting, it had to be 15-20 minutes that passed before our orders were taken. He even came back to refill our drinks, at which time I thought he would take our order, but alas, he had to return the empty glasses to the kitchen first.   All three of us had salads. I had the mike's chicken. The salad was a bit on the small side but the chicken was plentiful and well seasoned and overall the salad was tasty. Not ridiculously filling, but that was okay with me for a business lunch. My colleague had the buffalo chicken salad, which came topped with 3 HUGE onion rings. Looked tasty but i'm not sure how he managed to eat it in polite company; he is a pro. Our guest had the steak salad. He didn't remark but to me it looked well done as opposed to medium, which is what he ordered.   It was fine for a business meeting but I wouldn't return on my personal time."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar.  I ordered the Paddle Steak, mac & cheese with bacon, and asparagus.  I got the garlic crust on the steak, which I would not do again.  Maybe my expectations were off, but this seemed like small pieces of garlic that you would get out of a jar, not fresh garlic.  I liked the actual piece of meat better than Capital Grill, Hyde Park, and Eddie Merlot's although that is not saying too much.  Asparagus was spot on and the mac & cheese sounded better on paper.  It was a solid meal, but I would be fine if I never went back."}
{"text":"Just want to thank dirtka's for making my job so much easier! I work for a private jet company and getting catering from a restaurant is always difficult. The executive chef was so sweet to talk the menu over with me on the phone in advance to explain what he thought would be a good choice.  He also told me that if I called 30 minutes in advance, they can have it all done! Sucha relief! Since everything needs to be separated to keep fresh, I normally get turned away from the good quality restaurants.  But the day of the trip, it went just how I hoped. I called on my way to the restaurant and had everything packed by the time I got there. My passengers on the flight were so thrilled so have such an amazing coursed meal! They loved everything.   Crab cakes- were the best I've had  Cold crab legs- no dipping sauce needed  Lobster tail entree! Filet mignon- no need to add any sauces as well!   And mind you, this all tasted delicious even after I reheated the items on the plane!   Thanks so much again chef to you and your team!"}
{"text":"Way, WAY overpriced. I got the chicken piccata and wasn't at all impressed. The chicken was fatty and I couldn't eat half of it. The gnocchi was delicious, however, as were the hot rolls and crab bisque. But in no way was it worth $75+ for the two of us. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a delicious meal here on one of our few date nights out.  I was surprised how empty the restaurant was for a Saturday evening.  I ordered the crab cakes and the goat cheese salad. Best crab cakes I've ever eaten. So moist, high quality crab, and actually jumbo sized. The goat cheese salad was also a great size and I enjoyed the balsamic dressing. Husband had a steak which was cooked a perfect medium. He's super particular so that was a relief! He wished he ordered onions or something on top of his steak but didn't want to spend another $4 for a topping.  We also had the loaded baked potato which was well seasoned and perfect for sharing. I finished off my meal with a light and sweet creme brule and glass of pinot. It's not an every weekend type of place (can easily spend $150+ on dinner for two) but is a great quiet spot for special occasions. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service!! Such a wonderful night. We started with the spicy calamari, it was delicious. Perfectly fried with japelenos and hot peppers. We then got our crab bisque, also wonderful. The wife got the crab cake dinner and I got the 16 oz prime rib. Both were great meals, the crab cakes were delicious and the prime rib was a perfectly cooked medium rare. We also shared the a la carte smoked gouda mac and cheese, which is a must. So good!! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Although the wife and I had Ditka's on our far-term \"to-try\" list, Ditka's got the early bid when we were starving on a Saturday after running through lunch, but not nearly starving enough to end up eating at the Robinson Mall food court.  Determined to try something other than our Bocktown staple, the great Yelp reminded us that Ditka's was right up the road and a prime candidate for the picking.  The lunch menu is well priced for a medium/high-end steakhouse.  We both got lunch combos (the wife a turkey club and crab bisque, myself a reuben and salad) that were both filling, well priced, and quite good.  All in all, we made it out for less than $25 including tip, which is a small and well justified premium to pay over any of the other fast food options in the area.  Service was quick and attentive, and we were able to get in and out within 35 minutes...  exactly what we were looking for."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the service here. I went for drinks with my co-workers and it took a long time for our server to come take our orders and he would walk away before all of us could even ask for another drink. Then we had to wait again to receive our drinks. At one point I googled the drink menu because when I asked for their drink menu he just gave me a small pamphlet with their happy hour drinks (which happy hour was over). Two stars might be a litte harsh because I didn't try the food but honestly, it was my first time there and I don't have a huge desire to return. It was a Friday night and we sat in the bar area but still our server could have smiled and been more prompt."}
{"text":"The food is ok.  Nothing outstanding but the prices are high.   The filet didn't have much flavor.   Filets at Texas Roadhouse are bigger and taste better.  Service is fairly slow,  the waiters spend a lot of time socializing with each other.  It was better years ago."}
{"text":"Great service! Attractive staff. Nice ambiance. The nacho appetizer was amazing. Crab bisque was the best I've ever had. However the seafood platter completely ruined the experience. We ordered the 3-4 person platter. It was $59.00. It included approximately 4 oysters, 4 shrimp, maybe 1.5 crab legs, and a tiny portion of seared tuna.  Huge disappointment and grossly overpriced. As were the adult beverages."}
{"text":"Had not been here in several years, as our last visit was rather average. But not today! Everything was delicious, flavorful. Had the \"Paddle\" steak. Easily as good as, or maybe even better than any steak I have had at Hyde Park or Morton's.  They also had this amazing beef barley soup. The wife had Manchengo chicken. Very delicious and complex flavors. Tim, our server was superb also. Very knowledgeable and friendly. Had a calming effect. And his assistant looked like Anna Faris!"}
{"text":"Celebrated closing on our new house tonight. Food was terrific and the service was even better. We're new to town and don't have babysitters yet, so we had our baby with us. Benjamin and Camilla were so accommodating and understanding when he was fussy and needed changed - THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Lunch for 4 on 3/4/13. First time visit. The service was prompt, the food was tasty. I would like to try the place for dinner as I'm sure the menu is more extensive. Overall all four of us were pleased with the meal."}
{"text":"Very good food - steaks & lobster we're cooked just right - sides were plentiful and service was exceptional kudos to Courtney our waitress. I have eaten at Ditkas in Chicago a few times and was afraid the  Pgh would not hold up, but this location was excellent as well."}
{"text":"I would give them 10 stars if I could.   Best filet I EVER had!  Will was an awesome waiter, only complaint was my beer wasn't real cold but all in all would definitely come back on another road trip sometime since we are from Ohio"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner after traveling all day, and enjoyed the service, but the steak I ordered seemed to be poor quality. It was cooked right, and I expect a ribeye to have fat, but not the overly chewy/inedible kind. And it was in every bite, so I was constantly having to spit it out. I expected more from this nicer restaurant."}
{"text":"Being from the east side of the city, heading to the west side is almost never on the plan.  Ditka's was a great surprise after a long day out and about.  When you go to somewhere known for their steak.... well you have to get their steak.  I got the smaller filet with a garlic crust.  I might have been breathing away the vampires afterwards but it was 100% worth it. My steak was coooked perfectly and the crispy outside set that steak aside of other steak houses in the area.  This will definitely be on the list of places to return !"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch. I had one of their hamburgers and my fiancee had their pork chop. Did not bring any bread. They did not have strawberry lemonade. They did not have sweet tea. The pork chop was over cooked (she asked for medium well). The hamburger was pretty tasteless. The one thing I can say is the service was fantastic. But it was not worth a $12 tasteless burger and a $15 over cooked pork chop."}
{"text":"To start off it was very good food.. The seafood bisk was awesome and so was the crab cakes that I had for dinner... My wife had the salmon, I tasted it and it was pretty darn good..   The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the price we had 2 cups of seafood bisk the crab cakes which came with 2 cakes and a little salad (all on one plate) and the salmon on a mound of rice.. All for 80.00 bucks to me it was way to expensive.. And I think they were the cheapest things... Wow.. It was good but won't be going there any time soon"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Ditka's in Pitts, we were impressed the first time we ate there and returned with our extended family and were very pleased. We enjoy the variety of food choices and they do a nice job across the board. I was sceptical since many of the sports celebrity restaurants don't always live up to their reputation, I can vouch for Ditka's in Pitts.  We have had the crab cakes twice and definitely a great hearty dish, don't have it if your looking for a lighter option it's a good portion and real chunky crab meat. My family had the Chilean Sea Bass twice and really enjoyed that dish. Rare to find a steakhouse type venue with good seafood, usually they put fish on the menu to satisfy non-meat eaters but don't take it seriously. I enjoyed the 16oz Prime Rib, amazingly cooked and the mushroom accompaniment was delicious. I barely used any horseradish, the meat was so good.  Before sitting down I ordered a beer and the Guacamole/Salsa with chips, very impressed with the portions for a $9 appetizer. If I'm looking for a GoTo restaurant to share a nice meal in Pitts, I will be returning to Ditka's, hope everyone else shares the same experience."}
{"text":"I came here instead of the Capitol Grille and that turned out to be a huge mistake.   This place is a STEAK HOUSE that didn't have Béarnaise sauce. Seriously...  On top of that, they served our entree WITHOUT serving us our appetizer.    That is not a joke. I've been here maybe 6 times in the past. Going down hill.Last time I'll be going there. WAY TOO MANY BETTER OPTIONS..."}
{"text":"Finding ourselves west of the city at dinner time on a Saturday night, we ate at Ditka's, the only upscale restaurant around. It's a typical steakhouse, with a limited menu focused on steaks, a good wine list, and high prices. We didn't get steaks, choosing the single crab cake dinner with brown rice and coleslaw. The crab cakes were excellent, slaw pretty good, and the rice was dry. The server was efficient and professional, and bold, recommending a $130 bottle of Chardonnay. I was somewhat flattered that I appeared to be able to afford such a bottle, but couldn't bring myself to indulge. Relative to the other upscale steakhouses (excluding from consideration Morton's, which is a temple to waste, excess, pretense, and crude conspicuous consumption), Ditka's is in the bottom half of the league in terms of the overall experience, but also at below average prices. If you're west of the city it's a good choice for dinner, but not a destination in itself."}
{"text":"Food was Excellent.  Was a lot more upscale than I thought it was going to be.  Less of a sports bar more of a fine dining place.  Staff was extremely friendly and goes to great lengths to call you by name.  Never waited on drinks or food.  Loved everything about it.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Some of my earliest childhood memories involve the '85 Bears, so when I found out that Da Coach had steakhouse in Pittsburgh, I made a pilgrimage on my first day in town.  Ditka's has a lot going for it:  the service was extremely friendly, the atmosphere was classic old school steakhouse, the wine list was above average, and the steak (the paddle ribeye was a thing of beauty) and sides were all done very well.  I can't quite give Ditka's 5 stars--prices are a little on the steep side relative to quality--but it's definitely a place that's great for a business dinner or a special night out."}
{"text":"Wife and I had an enjoyable dinner there on Valentine's Day. My first drink was a Laphrogia (?) and water.  Didn't like it and the waitress said it was the bottom of the bottle.  She offered to get it from a fresh bottle, but I just changed my order.  Then, our first round of cocktails was very good, well poured and mixed very well.  And the Pot Roast Nachos were excellent.    The second round of drinks, however, we had to send back.  They tasted almost like they had changed bartenders and recipes.  But our waitress was more than glad to get them fixed, and upon return, we had a couple excellent cocktails again.  For our entrees, wife had a Filet Mignon that was cooked properly to her order.  It was however, maybe a little too lean.  It was tender but did not overwhelm with flavor as you would hope for at a high end restaurant.  But, I had the Kick Ass 20 oz bone-in Ribeye and my doctor is still yelling at me about it!!  It was flavorful, so moist, so tender, just so decadent, I'm sure my cholesterol went up 20 points as soon as it hit the table.  Absolutely delicious.  And I'm not much on mashed potatoes these days.  But what we had at Ditka's were awesome, it was hard to stop eating them.   And the wine that our waitress recommended (Keenan Cab) was very smooth and flavorful.  Overall, a very good dinner with understanding service.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch prior to a bridal appointment. Was not crowded at all and we were seated right away. Not much selection on the brunch menu but we both found options we really enjoyed. I had the eggs Benedict fillets which were fantastic. Steak was perfectly done as requested and the eggs were good with nice runny yolks. The potatoes that came with it were also very tasty. It is a little pricey for my tastes, but for a nice meal and change of pace it is completely reasonable. And this isn't one of those expensive tiny food places, you get a good full plate. Our server was friendly and helpful, he checked in on us a lot without being overbearing. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"lousy service, poor quality appetizers and small portions. This,place is a tourist trap close to the airport. We were thoroughly disappointed with The lack of service and poor quality of food. this,is a great place to go For a quick hamburger and a. Beer or coke. Do not go here if you are  Looking for a high quality meal.  Very disappointing..\"...."}
{"text":"Ditka's consistently has amazing service and great food. I always enjoy taking customers to eat there. Very healthy options and great steaks!"}
{"text":"Took the family here again, it's ok. I got the 16oz, strip it was cooked as ordered and was flavorful but it was way over priced and came with no sides. Ditkas is on par with Hyde Park or Capitol Grille but not Ruth's or Mortons. We also ordered the Crab cakes and calamari,  decent, could taste real crab and not heavily breaded but again not worth the money...we have had better for the money. However, the service was very very good, better than the last time we went. Our waitress was tentative and mannered in service. This is probably the best steak house in Moon TWP and we are likely to go back because although over priced i do like a good steak and service and don't have to drive to the burgh... like the city just not the time to drive.  Score Food Quality 4 Service 4 Atmosphere 4 Value 2 Recommend 3 ( 4 for food 2 for value = avg 3)"}
{"text":"Hubby said the best Calamari he's ever had, I have to say I agree. I had the soup of the day, Beef Barley, it was okay. Turkey Club was good. Hubby had the Prime Rib sandwich and said it was delicious. Great service and fresh food. Would definately come back"}
{"text":"The stars are not for the food (mediocre) or the service (quite good), but for this: our waiter tonight overheard our conversation and realized that my cousin had just, hours earlier, gotten home from Iraq. They upgraded his meal, sent us free food and drinks, comped everything he touched, and thanked him about 100 times for his service. There are some quality people running this establishment."}
{"text":"Only have gone for lunch but I like the following:  Da' Salads Da' Burgers Da' Sandwiches   Service is always impeccable. Cost - $9 - 14 depending on what you get.   You can jump out of a tree and get a steak but my burgers, sandwiches and salads are around $12. Food - Very Very good.  This is a popular place in the Robinson Twp Area"}
{"text":"Great Kobe sliders. 12oz Filet is a winner. Great steak. Great service."}
{"text":"I'd heard that the food at Ditka's didn't justify the price (when a friend was there years ago) and as of now, I completely disagree. Is Ditka's expensive? Yes. It seems on par with other nicer steak places in pricing and (like the others), I think it is worth that price for amazing food sometimes.  If you're looking for a great steak, this is a very good choice. It's a great choice for a special dinner. The service was amazing and the food was wonderful. I can't think of anything else I could ask for in a restaurant. The toppings (crab cake & sauce), side (smashed potatoes), & crab bisque were all wonderful, too. A lot of steak restaurants get the steak right, but not the rest of the meal. My dining companion and I both thought the prices were appropriate for the quality of the food and service.  Ditka's is not an every day restaurant, but it's great for special occasions!  Side note, there is NO entrance on Steubenville Pike (I had to make a u-turn in the snow, since I didn't realize that)."}
{"text":"It was good, not spectacular, but good.    I had the bone in rib eye but truth be told the steak at Longhorn Steakhouse is as good.    Service was very good. Water glass never went below half full.    Dessert was a disappointment. I had to laugh when I ordered the turtle pie. The waitress asked if I ever had it before because it's much better since they changed it. I told her this was my first time so I guess it's safe!"}
{"text":"If you like to wait a long time for overpriced, over cooked steaks then you have found your place. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I had a very good bone in ribeye!!  Had some very good sides as well.  THe place is pretty expensive, but on par with higher end steak houses.  The bartenders were very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly!  Will return!"}
{"text":"Very different! Let's start with their Pork Chop! You have to start with the Signature Dish and it was certainly exactly what they said! Delicious! More than a sitting to eat! Very well balance, flavor and tenderness! Highly recommended! Would certainly would return love to try their Breakfast hours."}
{"text":"My fience and I love this place. It's delicious, consistent, and we don't have to go into town for a decent meal. The steaks are always cooked properly and the sides are yummy as well. We come here usually for special occasions (anniversary, birthdays) and I try and mix it up and order different things. After eating here for 4 years, last night, while exceptional, had me thinking. My few tweets on this place would be:   -offer an off menu special or two. The menu hasn't changed in years. I love consistency but sometimes it's nice to have something different. Or at least the option.   -add a few other options for white wines by the glass. I wasn't a fan of the only Pinot Grigio they had on there. I personally love being able to try different wines while I'm out and pair things with my meal.   -switch up the dessert menu. It's a little one note. Basics and all fairly boring. We usually get the same two things allllll the time, even if we want some thing different because the options are limited. Or offer a rotating specialty dessert. The menu is mostly ice creams, something chocolate, and the Cream brûlée. The cheese cake option was chocolate, which was disappointing since they already have chocolate cake and a turtle pie. I'd love to see a white cake of sorts or something with berries. Just a thought.   -packaging. We usually order 5 courses and end up having left overs. It's sort of a peeve of mine that if I'm paying almost $200 for dinner (which I don't mind) my left overs are put in a white styrofoam container like I get when I order breakfast takeout from a diner. My other peeve is that both mine and my fiences food was packaged together without asking. I ordered crab with my steak...what if he had a shellfish allergy? The left overs would be a loss.   Sorry to sound picky. We do love this place. Like I said, food is always on point, service is amazing, ambience is lovely. The overall experience is good, just starting to get a little stale in my opinion. And for that, sadly, I knocked off a star."}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for dinner at 9:30 PM on New Year's Eve. The restaurant was very behind schedule with seating customers. My husband and I had to stand by the entrance for a long time, maybe one hour, before we were seated. The waiter was not too slow with taking and bringing our order of drinks and appetizers, but the bread basket came out very late. The appetizers, crab soup and sushi, did taste good, but I wonder if they tasted even better because our stomachs were so hungry. Our entrees, filet mignon and crab cakes, were definitely not the tastiest that we have ever eaten, but they tasted good. The filet was cooked to my husband's liking, and the crab cakes had much meat in them. My husband said that he was glad to have eaten at Ditka's but that he would never want to come back. I would be willing to come back, but Ditka's is not one of my top restaurants."}
{"text":"First asked if they had creme brûlée. Yes we do. Ok can I order carry out. Sorry we can't do it for you. Five minutes later call back and spoke with MOD asking if she can work with me since it was a college graduate problem. Ultimately I am the proud owner of 3 ramekins of creme brûlée and a son who thinks I made the world move.   Thank you to the mgmt for a solution to my problem."}
{"text":"I recommend the bruschetta as an appetizer, the crab stuffed shrimp, the pork chop and the filet and crab cakes."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if possible. GM threatened to call the police on another guest in our party after he questioned the wine corkage fee. Great night up until then. Waitstaff was wonderful. GM is an embarrassment and needs to go."}
{"text":"I've been to a few upscale steak places around the country, and this was a premium experience.  Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some really good suggestions for us on our meal choices.  I settled on the delmonico coffee rubbed steak, and I have to say, it was one of the tastiest steaks I have ever eaten.  A coworker and I split a fresh tomato salad which was excellent.  Dirty martinis were also very well prepared.  You get what you pay for, and at Ditka's, we got a lot.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday just before noon. My girlfriend recommended the restaurant for some reason to get a Bloody Mary. Never saw a menu....that was the first mistake. She ordered two -one without the Shrimp because of my medical condition. When the bill came I couldn't believe they charged us almost $25 for two drinks. The glasses they used were too tall for (1) the height of the bar and stools and (2) the straws were too short. I tasted mostly spiced bloody mary mix. I didn't see her pour the Vodka....so have no idea what she used if any. If you look at the menu, which I did before writing this you can see how overpriced the drinks are."}
{"text":"Service:   Wait was long at the hi-top table section in the bar.  Wait staff would take orders bouncing from table to table then placing orders via computer system.  This must have flooded the kitchen causing a back-up of table orders.  Food:   Pot Roast Nachos better than Atria's, evenly proportioned toppings to chip. Caesar Salad big portioned and refreshing.  I could have done without the nachos. Pork chop ordered Medium, which was overly cooked, barely any pink and was dry.  Requested for substituting Sweet Potato Mash with Red Skin Potato Mash, but the plate came with the Sweet Potato. Mango Passion alcohol drink helped me keep in together.  Overall = Overly priced for poor service, over-cooked Pork Chops.  I would not give this restaurant and re-do/re-visit."}
{"text":"Solid food, but like most celebrity chains...overpriced. This is much like a Shula's or Elway's Steakhouse. It tries very hard to be fancy - from the decor to how the food is presented, but it's really nothing special. I got the Steak Diane (or something like that) and it was two small filet's in a mushroom sauce with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Now I didn't expect the filets to be large..or even medium sized, but I could have cut each of them in half and been done in 4 bites. And I understand that asparagus is more of a garnish, but they seriously weren't big enough to stab with my fork. I spent more time chasing them around the plate to scoop them on a fork than I'd like to admit.   It was pretty good food and since it's on the company, I might go back for something else, but I'd never spend my own money here. I'm sure there are other options around here that are focused more on the food than aesthetics. I know I'll be checking around."}
{"text":"Great service. Yummy food. Started with the nachos - bbq pork. And the crab bisque was really nice. Bread rolls were fresh out of oven. Lentil week specials included some seafood not normally on the menu. Had fish tacos that were delicious. Unfortunately the rice was crispy and the beans had a bbq sauce flavor. Steak was awesome, tho!"}
{"text":"Service was the best thing about my visit , very attentive. Then the food. ... Sweet potatoes were amazing ! Steak was mediocre . Part of the end was burnt and it was served warm. Overall if you want to feel like a king , pay kings wages and eat like a knight go to Ditkas a tad over priced for the Quaility, but I now can check it off my culinary bucket list."}
{"text":"Darren brought me here a couple of weeks ago, and I was beside myself! I had a Lenten special--shrimp stuffed with crab meat--and it was worth dying for. The asparagus that came with it was perfectly cooked. Also scrumptious was the flourless chocolate cake, which was sexy decadence.   Ditka's is a little pricey, but the portions are big, the food is great, and the service is excellent (hi Patrick!).   Darren spoils me. I feel so guilty. :)"}
{"text":"The place has a nice ambiance, and service was good.  But the food and menu selections were average at best, and (like most restaurants which are owned by celebrities) was severely overpriced.  I certainly did not get my money's worth.  I would've enjoyed myself just as much going to Applebee's or Olive Garden right across the street, and not paid 3x more."}
{"text":"I have come to ditkas a few times so far, with 2 of these times being 6 stars out of five, and the last experience being a 3. I have liked it enough in the past that I chose it to be my birthday gift, as unfortunately I do not earn the salary to spend $100 a meal unless it is a special occasion. I assure you, however, if I did I would be a regular.   I did eat basically the same meal on each occasion, which was prime rib.   The good: the first two times the meat was exceptional, some of the best of my life, and I admit that my eyes closed, my heart skipped, and a smile crossed my face while I enjoyed this heavenly dish. I sang it's praises to my friends. I also love that it comes with horseradish, and the au jus is just right.   I also enjoyed a wedge salad each time - and ditka's has choice blue cheese dressing with enough chunks of the stuff to make you gleeful. I will order this every time I'm here. I only wish that it also included cucumbers, though I would imagine that they would have honored this request if I had remembered to ask. This salad could be lunch in and of itself.   The mac and cheese: I tend to say that cheese is my favorite food group, so I have high expectations here. This isn't the best I've had in my life, but it is creamy yet also cheesy goodness spread over cavatappi noodles (my favorite), topped with bacon and baked to perfection. Their other sides are probably also good, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be over the Mac and cheese enough to try them. Someone else at the table receive the biggest baked potato that I've ever seen.   The bread! I love when a meal starts off with fresh, crusty bread and real butter. Here you will get it piping hot from the oven, and it is truly one of life's simple pleasures.   Soup: my boyfriend gets the crab bisque. I try to distract him long enough to steal bites because if I order one to myself I won't have enough room for salad AND Mac and cheese. It's really good!!!   When we went for my friends birthday they offered complimentary cake and ice cream. I was sure I didn't want any until I was basically force-fed a bite. Then I realized that it was incredible and happily ate my share. I wish there was an way to eat literally all of the aforementioned in one trip without feeling terrible afterwards.   The bad: the last time my meat was overcooked. Prime rib should, in my opinion, never be more than medium, and this was rather well done though I did not order it that way. It was still good, which would be a difficult feat for another restaurant, though it wasn't 'birthday dinner' good. My father ordered the filet, and he felt that the $50 price tag was unjustified. For that much I do agree that it should be at least a 9/10, and this is a steak restaurant. It seems that we may have experienced an inadequate cook and inattentive server the last time, which does not seem to be the norm. I will still return, and hopefully all is well and right again when I do!"}
{"text":"The food was overpriced and mediocre. I ordered a steak and a potato, that was it.The steak wasn't poorly cooked, but there was absolutely nothing special about it, considering the price. There was no real seasoning or interesting juicey tastes. I also got a potato- not included with the $$ steak, and that was exactly what they brought - a giant unseasoned potato, with some frozen butter cups on the side.  All in all, nothing was awful, nothing I would send back to the kitchen; but for the absurd prices, I expected to be wowed by the quality of the food rather than \"meh\"'d.  On the plus side, I did see the mustached man himself enter as I was leaving, it was a little surreal."}
{"text":"Great bar area.  Dimly lit and a good selection of drinks.  The meal service is excellent and the food is really good.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good burger, nice service, enjoyed our lunch.  The pot roast nachos (I think a leftover from when Atria's was in this location) are a favorite.  However, the serving is smaller than what I remember from Atria's for at least the same (maybe more) cost to you."}
{"text":"This steak was excellent and the service was good,I just thought it was over priced. Everything is à la cart. I don't know if I would go again because of the $$$ but it was good overall."}
{"text":"This is my review #300.  Ditka's was open Thanksgiving Day -- a very good reason to give thanks.   I called ahead of time and made my reservation for 6:45pm. I was a little worried since there were so many people waiting and we were 45 minutes early to dinner.  As I heard the hostess tell people their wait time, my worry turned to fear that I would be waiting quite a while.  When I spoke to the hostess, she told me that there would be a long wait since they were the only restaurant in the area that was open.  I told her that I would wait until my reservation time.  It was at that point that her demeanor changed.  \"Did you say reservation?  Well, sir, right this way.  No one else waiting made reservations.\" the hostess exclaimed.  We were immediately seated in a circular booth overlooking the rest of the dining room and handed our prix-fixe menus with additional, select items from the normal menu.    My friend didn't even have to look at the menu, he already new what he was getting: the prix-fixe Turkey Dinner.  I, on the other hand was not going to eat turkey and so had to look through the rest of the a la carte menu to see what I was going to have for my dinner.  To help me along, I ordered our drinks:  Montoya Pinot Noir Absolute and Sierra Mist with a lime  The drinks came as I was looking through the menu.  There were, unfortunately, no substitutions allowed to the prix-fixe menu item under any circumstance.  With this new knowledge, I looked through and we ordered our entrees:  Turkey dinner (Turkey, Italian wedding soup, mashed potatoes, stuffing, green beans, Mike's salad, and cranberry sauce)  Filet mignon {medium} with butternut squash soup and mashed sweet potatoes  I decided to enjoy my surroundings while tasting my wine.  It was slightly spicy with some darker undertones and was enjoyable.  The dining room reminded me of a Members Only Club (or my imaginary conception of one) with its pillars, curtains that draw and separate different areas, and faux-ashlar stone walls.  It was a mix of rustic and demure done in a way that was not overtly offensive to my eyes.  Our server was quick to bring our soups and the salad.  Since my friend doesn't eat salads, I co-opted his for my own purposes.  It was filled with leafy greans, craisins, goat cheese (not feta), walnuts, apples and topped with a proper amount of balsamic vinaigrette.  The flavors were good and the sweet, tart, crunchy, and earthy flavors all melded together in a nice composition.  It wasn't the best balsamic I have ever had, but it was better than most places serve.  The wedding soup didn't taste bad, but it tasted more of a really good chicken soup with meatballs added as an afterthought.  There was nothing that truly made it an Italian Wedding soup.  The butternut squash soup had a very heavy butternut squash flavor -- this was a good thing.  I just wish that it transcended being pureed butternut squash to being more of a soup.  Don't get me wrong, it was good it just didn't taste or feel like a soup.  Our entrees arrived as I finished my soup.  The Turkey dinner was piled high on the plate on top of the mashed potatoes and the stuffing with green beans on one side and cranberry sauce on the other.  My filet came in the center of my plate with a gargantuan side of the mashed sweet potatoes.  I tried my filet to find that it was cooked perfectly with a nice, spicy flavor to the seared exterior.  I really enjoyed this filet.  The mashed sweet potato did not taste like sweet potato; it tasted like mashed yam.  Again, the flavor didn't bother me; it had good flavor and it wasn't stringy or lumpy. It just wasn't what I was expecting because of the name.  I looked over to the turkey dinner and was pleased to see that it was all-white, breast meat.  I tried the turkey (just because I don't eat a lot of it doesn't mean I don't like the flavor) and found that it wasn't dry and that the gravy complimented the turkey flavor without covering it.  I tried some of the mashed potatoes and they also had a very good, simple, potato flavor to them and the green beans also had a very good flavor while being perfectly cooked.  I didn't much care for the cranberry nor the stuffing and I am a stuffing maniac. We finished off the meal with ice cream and pumpkin pie.  Again, they tasted good, but I felt as though I could have purchased comparable at Giant Eagle or Publix.  While the food was good, the execution was not the best.  I give Ditka's 3-stars plus 1 for being open on Thanksgiving.  The service was spectacular, but the price on the non-prix-fixe items is steep."}
{"text":"Another great meal and experience at Ditkas.  We sat at the bar since we didn't make a reservation.  This time I had the twin filets and crab cakes while my husband ordered the ribs.    Initially when I saw the portion size of the filet and crab cakes, I thought it seemed a bit small, but when trying to eat it, I could only eat one filet and one crab cake and gave the remaining to my husband.  I ordered the filets well done and they were still melt in your mouth tender!  The crab cakes were perfectly seasoned.    All in all, another fantastic meal and experience at Ditkas.  I think this may be our go-to for fine steak dining!"}
{"text":"Ditkas is definitely one of the better options in the Robinson area. The price point might keep most away but the food is good I would say especially if you're looking for a decent steak or fish dinner. There are some select items on the menu worth going for... the pot roast nachos, jalapeño hash browns, the Chilean sea bass is my favorite, and steak here is always a solid choice. You need to try the key lime pie if you're in the mood for dessert."}
{"text":"In a sea of chain restaurants, Ditka's stands out in a number of ways. First, the decor is lush, dark, and \"club-y\". Clearly this is a steakhouse of a high caliber. Had dinner at the bar, and all the staff I dealt with were friendly, professional and geared toward pleasing the customer. This is good because Ditka's is probably not the best place to go if you have a gluten intolerance. The menu is not GF friendly at all. Surprising at this price point, and in this day & age when most upscale eateries (and almost all the chains) have either a dedicated GF menu, or clearly have thought about steering you toward certain \"safe\" choices. And there were very few things on Ditka's menu that could be made GF without clearly ruining the idea of the dish. Nevertheless, my server worked hard to find a choice that would work, and work it did!   Started off with a delicious glass of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Ditka's gives you a very decent pour on your glass of wine, and in fact portions on everything here are generous. I was eyeing up the pot-roast nachos being enjoyed next to me at the bar. And the gentleman to my left had shrimp cocktail with crustaceans that might have been confused with small lobsters. Nice.  My prime rib and broccoli was perfectly cooked & seasoned. I'm not sure how there can be such a dramatic difference between the quality & taste of prime rib at various restaurants, but Ditka's clearly is among the best I've had --anywhere. Truly delicious, and not requiring any additional sauces, or condiments. The cut was generous (even the smaller size I ordered) and there was very little waste -- just a gorgeous slab of prime rib. Ditka's gets a very nice clientele, and the place was surprisingly packed on a Wed evening with some of the more well-heeled locals, and out-of-towners. This is one of the more pricey choices for dining in this part of Pittsburgh, but if you value great beef and high-quality service, it's worth every penny. Should the chef decide to adjust their menu slightly to better accommodate those with gluten issues, I'd give it five stars easily."}
{"text":"I went to Ditka's for Valentines Day and my Anniversary today. The food was awesome and we will definitely come back again. The server did a great job. The was my first experience at Ditka's I definitely should have come sooner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat at the bar. The crab bisque was amazing. I ordered a wedge salad, which was delicious; however, a bit too much dressing for me. It is a great blue cheese dressing and the salad was iceberg, bacon, grape tomatoes, and garnished with cucumber slices. Very tasty, just  too much dressing. Will definitely come back to try other menu items!!"}
{"text":"So returned back here for a work team dinner and wasn't super hungry so got a trio of small plates instead. However my co-workers were brilliant about sharing so got to try a bit of their food too!!  I ordered the Broccolini ($7.95), the Burgundy Mushrooms ($7.95 and watch out - these were very drunk indeed!) and Mike's Salad ($6.95 and consisted of pecans, goat cheese, apples, dried cranberries, balsamic vinaigrette, mixed greens). I also asked for extra goat cheese and was charged a $1 for it. Of the above 3, the mushrooms were my fave, and I actually ate these with the goat cheese. Mike's Salad for my taste, had waaay too much vinaigrette - I would have appreciated some restrain on the dressing. The Goat Cheese and Roasted Pecans were delish tho'. The Broccolini ate a bit dry and had this lemony- tart sprinkle on it - but that sour lemon taste wasnt consistent and I tasted it randomly.   From my table mates, I tried the following:   Jalapeno Hash Brown ($7.45) - The hash brown was a bit bland, even if cooked very nicely. Couldn't taste the Jalapeno at all! Overall just eh and wouldn't get it again.  Sherry Crab Bisque - I had loved this soup last time, but this time it was just so heavy on the cream and sherry, the taste of the crab was lost...such a pity this time didnt taste as good as on previous visit.  Mashed Red Skin Potatoes ($5.95) - DELICIOUS!! Creamy with a bit of textural roughness from the skin. Loved the taste and would get again.  Lobster Ravoli ($30.95) - So that parmesan-sage cream sauce went down a treat when combined with the Broccolini. On it's own it was a bit too heavy. Also could have used a more generous helping of those baby tomatoes to undercut the richness. Overall liked it, so wouldnt mind getting again.  Manchengo Chicken ($23.95) - Tasted too heavy for me, and I found that breaded and fried chicken to be too oily for me. Liked the basil cream, wish there'd been more. Probably wouldnt get again.    Our waiter and service was fantastic! I'd come back and try other things on the menu when in town again.   PS - so this would have been Yelp 65/2018 in the normal course of things, but I don't count reviews of repeat places in my yearly total - only new places are counted towards my list!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant one hungry Sunday evening via the help of yelpers. Well I hope this help future restaurant goers.  Food and wait: There was no wait and the restaurant was 3/4 empty. We should've seen this as a warning sign for things to come. We ordered the Kobe burger, the nachos, and crab bisque. The crab bisque was the highlight of the evening, warm, delicious, and o so creamy. The pot roast nachos, large in size but the meat was too sweet so I ended up spending $13 on chips, cheese, jalapenos and sour cream. The burger was my friend's highlight of the night, mostly because he was up all night with food poisoning. Not so cool.   Service: Even though there were only a handful of tables, our waiter was absent the majority of the night. There's nothing that urks me more than having to play \"I spy the waiter\" in an attempt to flag down the bill.   The crab bisque was great, but would I come back? Nope."}
{"text":"My last trip to Ditkas was the first time I was disappointed.  We had a variety of items and all were marginal.  The burgers were woefully underdone to the point of uncooked despite being ordered medium.  Based on their prices it has fallen below it's previous standards.  Hope they improve"}
{"text":"I visited on a rather slow Sunday night. Staff was very gracious. I ordered the crab cakes which were absolutely delicious, meaty and stuffed full of goodness. It had big lumps of crabmeat and the remoulade was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and had a nice experience. Calamari was little salty but other food was really nice. Burger was flavorful, and lobster bisque was rich and not salty. Also, the place was well decorated and the servers were kind and nicr."}
{"text":"This celebrity chain steak house produces about what you would think, average food. The sports memorabilia and pictures make for a great surrounding. The atmosphere is that of an upscale sports bar and sadly, the food tasted that way. The steak was highly overpriced for the quality of meat being served. It was cooked correctly and the wait staff was excellent. Others at the table had a few of the fish entrees and they all had small portions with little flavor. The visit will be a one and done for me. It's not worth the expense of taking a group there."}
{"text":"I like \"Da Pork Chop\". It is actually a combination of two different kinds of pork meat. Price is a bit too high."}
{"text":"I agree with some other reviews about the prices being too expensive for the location. I also have to say that the food and service were excellent. I had the twin fillets with crab. Cooked perfect, not one bite of fat either. My wife had the gnocchi and it was delicious also. Server was on point with everything from refills to getting our check."}
{"text":"Very good. Here for business and happy to see it across the street. Salad was great. Entree was the filet and crab cakes and was outstanding. Bar staff was very friendly and welcoming. Packed at 530 so get there early or make a reservation."}
{"text":"For touting itself as a steakhouse, Ditkas ought to be ashamed of sending out cold prime rib the first time and overcooking a fifty dollar piece of meat the second time. As I waited for the waitress to come around the buss boy asked If I wanted a box and when I said no thanx he wisked away the plates so fast that the silverware went flying and my meat with two bites removed was gone. This place was not a good experience for me and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Ditka's in Chicago a few years ago and liked it, even though it is a little pricey. This one is same. The Prime filet mignon was excellent although a bit charred for medium. Still, that was one tasty piece of beef! Service was excellent. It is a little loud that I could not hear my iphone using the bluetooth earpiece."}
{"text":"Great steaks, I had mine cajun and blackened, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here for our anniversary and other then a little wait and a total price, everything was excellent. Our waiter learned it was our anniversary and went out of his way to make it special! We had wines and appetizers, dinner and dessert. The portions were perfect. The atmosphere was great, for any special occasion. If in the area again, we would in fact return and would indeed recommend it!"}
{"text":"Mighty fine place for a casually nice dinner.  Not outstanding, but fine.  It just missed on so many items that it couldn't get more than three stars this time.  The staff went above and beyond in preparing a gluten-free entree of the pecan-encrusted mahi...then overcooked it to the point of being dry and tough.  The presentation was gorgeous!  Coconut sticky rice was a perfect companion for the fish, but the sauces were far too sweet and cried out for acidity to balance the sweetness.    The hubster had the prime rib, which was fine, too.  Again, not outstanding, but fine.  He enjoyed it and the baked potato, too.    Finished off with a fine creme brulee, but the two tiny raspberries perched on the top might as well have been skipped.  Maybe I've been spoiled by creme brulees with big gorgeous assorted berries elsewhere, who knows.  The custard was smoothly rich and wonderful, but the bruleed sugar was overbrowned (almost burned) and far too thick...had to use some real power behind the spoon to crack that baby!  The best item of the night was the Bloody Mike, but even that has been better on other occasions.  Might just have been an off night."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the reviews. Slow service, new wait staff and other standard issues faced in most restaurants aside, at least rate the food for what it is.   I ordered the Delmonico Ribeye with a light salt and pepper coating, cooked med rare and it came out w a lightly charred crispy outer crust that was devine. I sprinkled on a small pinch of their coffee rub spice mix across the top and poured a small sampling of their in-house butter sauce on the plate then began to simply cut, chew and smile. Over and over and so on. The grilled onions as the side were a sweet surprise. I was in heaven.   Even the \"Mike\" mixed greens salad w the light vinegrette dressing over the goat cheese, cranberries, nuts was again delicious. I left no crumb unturned.  I was so focused on the steak that I forgot about the perfectly cooked long asparagus tips w bernaise starring at me. Even Mike's in house Lager was good enough and  respectable enough to compete with most micro brews any day.  The waitress was also delightful and knew the menu and the steaks well. Her comments made all the difference.   I went there while in Pittsburgh for one night and I wanted a Pittsburg steak to provide a great memory to go back to Tampa with. The experience lived up to the well appointed restaurant details and then some.   Read what you want but when in town do as Mike would,  bring some friends, have a good beer and order a great steak.  Thanks for a good experience. I was hoping to see at least Mike and being a HUGE Steeler Fan, maybe Bradshaw, Swann,  Greene or Big Ben would be hanging around but it wasn't meant to be. I guess I was disappointed when it comes to setting a fee expectation but then again we all do it.  T"}
{"text":"Ditka's is better than most of the chain fare you will see in this Robinson Town Center area - albeit more pricey.  If you are traveling for business and staying near the airport, this is a good choice.    I had a light meal with a Mike's Salad and an order of Blackjack sweet potato smash with smoked bacon.  Bacon on sweet potatoes is quite a combo of flavors.  They are a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Having been to Ditka's twice now, I feel I can write a fair review. First time at Ditka's was on a random Saturday and it was an awesome experience. Second time at Ditka's was on New Years Eve, 12/31/15.  A restaurant that performs well when they're incredibly busy is generally a good indicator in my opinion of how it operates normally. On NYE, they were packed. Out the door, piled up around the front of house. We made reservations. Our wait was roughly 15 minutes. The girlfriend and I sat at the bar and had a drink or two until we were seated.  Service was prompt and courteous. She had the filet and lobster tail.We started with the calamari appetizer. It was awesome. Probably one of the best I've eaten in fact. Not chewy. I had the prime rib. Prime rib was cooked perfectly. Her filet and lobster tail were also cooked perfectly. The prime rib was pretty stellar. Normally, I don't eat prime rib, but I figured I'd give it a spin. I was impressed. I also don't normally eat filet, however I had tried her's and it was excellent. Excellent enough that I intend to order one the next time we go. The lobster tail was cooked perfectly as well.  Sides were mac and cheese and asparagus. Both sides were hot. Very good. Normally I don't eat mac and cheese, but whatever their preparation is, it's great. Asparagus was a bit on the large side, however I expect that in the winter season.   I passed on the desserts, she had a creme brulee which looked very good. I went with a cup of coffee(Lavazza.)  Excellent experience at Ditka's. Wait staff is on point. Management is on point. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was in the shopping area and i asked one of the locals wheres a good place to eat. Then he mentioned Ditka's which isn't that far from the mall. From the outside and inside, it seemed like it was a top notched/expensive restaurant. It wasn't, the price is just right considering the quality of food they give you. The server was pretty cool because she suggested the soup of the day for an appetizer. It was some lobster something but i couldn't remember but i wasn't a fan of it. I tasted it and when the waiter came back, she asked if i liked it which i gave her an odd look like it was ok. She told me to be honest and i said it wasn't my taste. So she took it off the bil which is really cool because i know in other restaurants, they wouldn't do that. I wish they had Ditka's closer to SF Bayarea."}
{"text":"Had dinner for 5 Friday night jan 10th, service was great and food was good as usual, and I've eaten her a few other times, but something must have been off this nite because me and my 17 year old son got very sick, I was throwing up all night Friday night and he was nauseas all day Saturday and throw up all sat night. That day (Friday) was the first time I seen him in a week because he was visiting his mom that week. We both had filet with a garlic crust, and we both had the same desert, a mocca cheese cake.  The other 3 people at the table did not get sick."}
{"text":"Whenever I pick my girlfriend up from the airport, we head to Ditka's to split a piece of prime rib and some sides.  The food is always incredibly consistent, and the prime rib is one of the better cuts of meat you'll find in a restaurant.  The service is very fast and efficient, and they tend to run some good drink specials.  Ditka's is pricey, but you get what you pay for.  Sides are shareable."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. The overall experience was pretty good. We got the Bruschetta, which was good. The potatoes were AMAZING. The steaks were too salty for my taste and were a little under cooked. The chocolate cakes was also AMAZING.  Our server was REALLY REALLY attentive. To the point where I was like can you disappear for ten minutes?"}
{"text":"A nice, quick late lunch that served us for diner as well. That's what we did at Ditka's today. Typically great quality, great service, and overall decent atmosphere, that's what you should expect here. I feel that the more we stop in, the better it gets. Today, Sunday after brunch was over at 3pm, we enjoyed the serenity of the place with only about three other patrons. Our server was prompt, and knew the menus well. The entrees were spot on and the filets were exactly as we expected them. High marks for today's experience."}
{"text":"I brought a couple of colleagues on a business dinner here. The staff was very attending and helpful. The ambience was intimate and dark, but it wasn't very exclusive feeling as I would have imagined.   The food was A-OK. The Filet Mignon seemed very dry and I ordered Medium cooked. The side choices were good, but were not very hot when we digged in.   Over all for the kind of food you get it is very overpriced. However, this is a place where you come because you can afford to and not because you want to for the food. Its for the service, the name and the ambience."}
{"text":"Over priced, over salted, chain restaurant food. The food is truly mediocre. The staff, while friendly, are in desperate need of training--particularly in wine service. Our server, Zach, seemed very uncertain of himself as he poured and decanted our wine. He was spilling it and making major service errors. For $500+, I would rather travel a bit further and go into Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"After picking my son up at the airport, we stopped there for dinner.  I was very disappointed.  The food portions were very small and highly over-priced. The staff was friendly and courteous but not overly attentive.  The atmosphere was OK but I have been to much better restaurants, had better food and paid half as much.  I will not be returning to Ditka's anytime soon, if ever."}
{"text":"Very pricey for a steak house. You are most definitely paying for the name and not the food."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. I've eaten at Ditkas in Chicago more times than I can count on two hands and two feet. I knew the quality of the meals and service to expect but I don't know where to start about Da Coaches place in his home town. What a disaster. Had a 10 top their Monday night and things couldn't have gone worse. It was Monday and of course the Head Chef and A team were not there and that became apparent once the food showed up. Apps might as well been from Dennys. Cold and rubbery calamari, cold pot roast nachos by the crab cakes were decent.  Here's the deal: The cadence and control of the waitstaff and the kitchen is completely out of sync. Waitstaff, under trained, young and not seasoned. Clearly the practice squad and not the starting lineup.  Soup had a layer of dried Scum on top from sitting under the window too long. Salads were average.  Main course: crappy crusty, flavorless steaks served on \"Cold\" plates?? WTF Mike? Cold plates? I refused to eat my 45 day old filet as it was not 45 day old aged and the outside was burned to a crisp, the inside dry and tasteless while the red interior had zero heat. The Monday chef cooks like a caveman!! I sent back the filet  and ordered a NY Strip instead. It was good but not that good.   Bottom line: This is not your real Ditkas folks unless this Ditkas was in a hospital commissary where the food is only slightly below average but you don't care as the experience you are going through tending to a sick friend in the hospital overshadows anything you might eat there.   To quote Da Coach: \"Effort without talent is a depressing situation... but talent without effort is a tragedy. - Mike Ditka  We could not have said it better! Sorry coach, DItkas in Pittsburgh is a losing team."}
{"text":"Jalepeno hash and 12oz prime rib with mushrooms was fantastic! Wine selection is great and so is the service. Very happy! If I lived in town I'd be there twice a week"}
{"text":"First time at Ditkas... I had a Saturday night early dinner. I ordered a Fridge Burger medium rare with everything... cheddar, mustard, mayonnaise, onions, pickles, lettuce, and tomato. The burger was cooked to perfection and paired with your average steak house fries. This dinner \"meal option\" was great for it's relatively low price of just under $15. It's one of the few \"meals\" on the menu in this price range, unless you order an appetizer or side as your meal. I should mention... One of the members of the group I was with had a delicious looking dessert that she loved as well. It was the flour-less chocolate cake.  I'm just confused about the identity of this place. The menu hosts an expensive array of steaks and seafood. Dinner prices range from $22-$60. Yet they play hip-hop and pop music and sell t-shirts in the lobby? Not to mention there's a beautiful view of the highway traffic and a Get-Go gas station from the dining room windows. Don't get me wrong, the interior is gorgeous and I love the murals and photos on the walls. It couldn't be any cleaner inside and yes, the food was great.  However, remove the high-end prices and the somewhat uptight waiters/waitresses and you have yourself a Longhorn Steakhouse. Hard to imagine enjoying a $60 meal (not that I ever would) while watching someone pump gas into their mini-van across the street.   5- food 3- pricing 4- interior 2- ambiance 2- service"}
{"text":"Ditka's was worth every penny. It is on the pricey side of things so keep that in mind before going. I ordered filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. The flavors were on point. The waiter was excellent and gave me a great wine recommendation that suited my meal perfectly. The lobster mac n' cheese was absolutely exquisite. Creamy and rich. Overall, the restaurant was very clean and had a very nice ambience. I recommend this place for a romantic date night or celebratory dinner."}
{"text":"We went there on NY eve and ordered off of their menu for that night. The steak was delicious.  I wasn't crazy for the mac n' cheese but it wasn't bad.  The waitress was attentive.  I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Probably the best lunch I have had in the Robinson area.  The service was unbeatable.   I am very fussy about food being undercooked but my Manchego chicken which was perfectly prepared.   I am looking forward to returning here for a dinner."}
{"text":"With complete sobriety, I will state that this past Friday night, Ditka's delivered to Kay and I an ambitious feast full of upscale standards that were not innovative but were consummately executed. One doesn't go to Ditka's to experience maddening originality or to be at the white-knuckled forefront of gastronomy; one goes to Ditka's to experience tradition done exceedingly well.   Take for instance the Oyster Shooters. Each of the two I had merely contained a meaty, chilled oyster, a potent cocktail sauce, and an even more potent tabasco vinaigrette. What else is needed?   Being that it was a Lenten Friday, I resisted the urge to get steak and opted instead for the Maryland Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes and the Giant Baked Potato, which I substituted for the rice pilaf. The twin crab cakes were so pure of meat, I wondered just what was binding the pieces of protein together; any filler there may have been seemed non-existent. The chunks of meat were massive yet dainty, and the fabulously flaky helpings of cake themselves were munificent. In a small, metallic cup was a textbook remoulade (called 'tartar sauce') that merely added opulence to an already opulent dish with its union of creaminess and tang.  Is there a better crab cake on the market? I'll throw down the gauntlet for Ditka's for these crab cakes were every bit as burly as the man the restaurant is named after and were quite simply sterling in every regard.   The Giant Baked Potato lived up to its name and came with cheddar cheese, bacon, butter, and sour cream. Colossal, leathery of skin like a football, and billowy of flesh, the spud was its own self-contained meal-within-a-meal. Just when I thought I hollowed the tuber out completely, there was more steamy starch to uncover.   Baked potatoes are a minor obsession of mine, or make that, were a minor obsession. Like the crab cakes, I doubt I'll find a better example elsewhere.   The cole slaw, a side that came with the entree, was artfully presented in a cup of lettuce. Cool and crisp, there was also some sort of unknowable quality to it. Was it a hint of ginger? Mint? What manner of herbal magic possessed this slaw?   Even the complimentary rolls were peerless. Delivered hot, they were accompanied not by butter packets but real whipped, decorated butter that resembled icing piped onto a wedding cake. Crusty on the outside, when cracked open, the rolls revealed rolling hills of cottony bread onto which the butter broke down divinely like an actress baring her soul onstage.   For dessert, it was something not listed on the online menu involving turtle ice cream, a chocolate dome, nuts, caramel, and a turtle. A little on the unwieldy side, this fortress of confection took some time to dismantle, but I found that the longer it took me to eat it, the easier it became to eat as everything softened. The turtle candy acted as a base. A large ball of ice cream sat atop the turtle, and all of it was encased in chocolate and garnished with chocolate drizzle. An exercise in excess? I call it a towering monument to what must be Mike's favorite candy, and I worshipped it like the graven idol it was.   Patrick, our server, was an absolute professional, and that's all that needs to be said about him.   Don't dismiss Ditka's because of the celebrity nametag attached to it or because it's a chain (there are only 3 of them in the entire United States) in an area full of them. The price point is steep (our tab was over $90), but the portions were hefty and every single thing we ate was nothing short of superb. Go on a special occasion and treat yourselves or someone you care about. Take in the gloomy, intimate decor of the quiet, walled-off dining room. Look up at light fixtures that resemble slivers of the moon as you indulge in some magnificent steakhouse fare. Let Mike take care of you and yours. After all, one gets the impression that he opened a restaurant merely because he wanted all of us visiting or living around his hometown to have a good, classy time every once in a while in a place he himself would like to frequent.  P.S. We didn't need to make reservations on a Friday night. Our visit was strictly impromptu, and I reckon Mike would approve. Guys like him don't make reservations."}
{"text":"Da Coach was not in but the staff did a great job.  Stopped in for a late night drink and some dessert.  A friend called, said he was at Ditka's  for dinner before a flight and his flight was delayed a couple of hours...come on out!  We called another friend, picked them up and had a little party!  The wine list has some good wines, maybe a little expensive.  We ordered some calamari to snack on.  The calamari was good.  Then someone ordered a few of the deserts and a few extra forks and plates.    The deserts were OH SO GOOD!  The service was friendly and on top of everything.  Stopping by to check on us and complete any refills that were needed.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Went for a business dinner last night with my boss and our team. We made reservations so we we're sat very quickly. The service was EXCELLENT; very knowledgable waitress and our water glasses were always full. Their Sherry Crab Bisque was amazing (best bisque I've ever had); I should have ordered a bowl. My steak (half back filet) was good but not anything special; although the way they cook it did give it a bit of a crispy outside which was really cool. The sides were good but could be spruced up a bit. Overall highly recommend a visit (expect to drop a pretty penny)."}
{"text":"Ditka's is one of those places I can give or take honestly. It is so hit or miss for me that the only time I go know is when someone else wants to go.   When with a group, we usually start out with a regular order of the Coach's Pot Roast Nachos. Which is pretty much just pot roast, cheddar-jack, jalapeños, sour cream and tomato. On a good day, the pork roast falls apart in your mouth and the cheese has that stringy consistency that you want when it comes to nachos.  The fridge burger is just your typical burger. They typically cook it exactly how I want it, so I really can't complain about it. I just think it is a little boring.   When it comes to the steak, I tend to like to go with the Filet Oscar. You get an 8 oz filet  (i like to get the garlic crust on it) topped with jumbo lump crab meat and bearnaise. Again, if it is a good day, this is a great dish. I only eat my meat medium rare and half the time it usually comes out medium well. The crab is usually cooked to perfection, and the bearnaise sets it off perfectly.  There are two things that are always consistent: the dessert and the service.  My typical go to dessert is the triple layer chocolate cake that is absolutely phenomenal. The creme brulee is usually on point as well.   Other than dessert, I will always rave about the service. The staff is always attentive and so nice. Always willing to help and answer any questions you may have."}
{"text":"Good but quite pricey. Ordered the half back filet, supposed to be an 8oz, looked more like 6 oz. Everything is extra, sides, salads etc. Figure on at least $60-70 per person not counting wine, tax or tip. Value is not there compared to chain steakhouses like Longhorn where you can get the same meal under $30."}
{"text":"We recently attended a \"Meet and Greet\" with Coach Ditka held at the restaurant. We could not have been more disappointed. Coach Ditka never addressed the attendees or made any effort to thank people for \"paying\" for the privilege of being in his presence. Instead he sat at his table without a smile and agreed to autograph memorabilia that was for sale on a nearby table. No charm, no energy and no desire to engage with the attendees.  We like the restaurant. The food, service and design are all very good. But it's clear that management of the restaurant and Mr. Ditka have completely different motivations. I'll continue to patronize the restaurant, not because of, but in spite of the restaurant's namesake."}
{"text":"I must say, I really wasn't very impressed. I think it deserves 3.5 stars but can't bring myself to give it a 4. We went during restaurant week 2018 and did their pre-fixed menu. I got the Mike's salad, which was really very good. For the main entrée I chose the steak and crab cake and mashed potatoes. First, the lack of a vegetable in an entrée seems a bit odd to me, especially when they give you literally a huge pile of potatoes to make up for the tiny meat. The crab cake was small but good, a bit overly seasoned so you didn't get the flavor of crab very much. The steak was very tiny, which I was expecting. Again, it was alright. Not amazing. For dessert I had chocolate cake. It was subpar at best. They didn't even heat it up. For a $35 dinner at a nice restaurant I would think you could pop the chocolate cake in the microwave for 10 seconds at the very least.  After tip we spent around $90 for two people for mediocre food, albeit great service, everything came out very quickly and our server was very nice. We didn't even order any drinks, a simple glass of wine started at $11. I think this restaurant could be decent but they are just greatly overpriced and that hurts them. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Talk about a great place to start off your new year!  This was our spot for New Year's Eve!  The host staff had their hands full on this particular night.  And they did an amazing job!  Plus, we requested a booth.  And even with a full house, we got our booth.  For our server, well, he gets a star, but we won't go into farther detail.  They offered a shorten menu for the evening.  But it offered everything important.  For us, we opted to go with the dinner for two option.  This included a soup or salad option, a shared flour chocolate cake for dessert and a champagne toast.  For our meals, we both got a filet mignon with a lobster tail.    Let me just say, our meal here was amazing.  My salad was incredibly fresh, BJ's sherry crab bisque was the best I have ever had.  Both of our steaks was cooked a little bit less than how we had requested, but we didn't mind.  The flavor and seasoning was very good.  We also ordered a side dish, we got the Black Jack mashed sweet potatoes.  These was heaven in a small serving dish!  This is not a restaurant that we frequent.  But any time we have visited, we have loved it."}
{"text":"Oh, Mike Ditka!  Not only am I a fan of the man but I am an even bigger fan of his restaurant.    I came here for my birthday and enjoyed a beautifully cooked fillet Mignon.  Each bite was better than the last.  I was tempted to order another one just because I didn't want the experience to end.    Everything else was good but I don't think I would come back for it.  The ambiance was very intimate, warm, and inviting.  The walls are covered with murals and pictures of sports legends.  Mike's Salad was tasty and fresh - but really why order anything else?  You're here for the meat!  Mike Ditka's meat!  My mouth is watering just remembering the flavor.  In case you missed the point - ORDER A STEAK!  MEDIUM!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect from a nice steakhouse. Good fresh food, nice atmosphere and wonderful servers. Everyone enjoyed their food and everything was cooked very well. The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is because nothing blew us away. It was all good and there were no complaints but there was nothing truly exceptional.   I would like to compliment The wait staff on going above and beyond to accommodate the two two celiac diners in our party. They even thought to remove the candied almonds from the house salad and offered to prepare foods specially gluten free.  Nice restaurant, and a nice nice out."}
{"text":"Within less than 72 hours, I ate at Ditka's twice while on business in Pittsburgh. And both times, it was soul-touchingly AMAZING! Tuesday I had the crab-stuffed shrimp and scallops with asparagus. While the seafood here is fresh (any fresher and it would've swum it's way down my esophagus) and paired well with the pinot grigio, I want to share my experience with the pot roast nachos. Why? Because I'm a simple girl that finds the most joy in the simple things of life.   Within 5 days, I had the best and worst nachos I've ever had in my life in Pittsburgh. Needless to say, Ditka's was the site of my nacho zenith. I showed up after watching Alice in Wonderland 3D (absolutely alone in the theater, no less). I'd seen the pot roast nachos on the menu two nights earlier and knew I had to have them before I left the area. I had the tavern size of the nachos (1/3 smaller and cheaper than what's listed on the regular menu) and the cultural cuisine amalgamation of American pot roast and Tex Mex nachos was sublime. When Sandy (I'll tell more about her later) brought them out, they were beautiful to behold and even more exquisite to consume.   Shallow pools of perfectly melted warm cheese united the thin, crisp, tortilla chips together. The chips were dotted with sliced green onions, jalapeno peppers, quaint smatterings of sour cream, succulent diced tomato, and fork-tender shreds of pot roast. The smaller portion was just right. It was sufficiently satisfying yet not overwhelming. I would likely have died from eating the full size portion size portion solo as I'm verily sure I'd have simultaneously experienced alpha and omega and simply ceased to exist.  As I said earlier, I'd comment on Sandy later. Sandy, simply put, was an angel. I was undecided between two beers and she let me try a sample of both. She not only gave me silverware in a cloth napkin, but prepped my eating space with a napkin to cover the raw bar wood. Like an angel, she knew when to check on me. She didn't hover like an overprotective mother or let me suffer like an tough-love one either. She even took the time to introduce herself and find out not only my name but my purpose in town. Fantastic service indeed!  I highly recommend Ditka's as the place to go when you're in Pittsburgh. Though it's not in the main city (closer to the airport), the restaurant's service and food are endearing ambassadors of the city and not to be missed (just a note, there are only 2 other Ditka's and they're both in Chicago, though I can't personally vouch for them and the one here is definitely a highlight of Pittsburgh!)"}
{"text":"Great steak, atmosphere, and adult professional servers. Really fun yet elegant place to have a dining experience."}
{"text":"I took my 9 friends here for dinner and it was incredible from start to finish. We all got their best steak, and it melted in our mouths. We tried all the appetizers on the menu, and the jumbo shrimp alone without any sauces was probably one of the best, most savory shrimp I have had in a long time. For starters, we all tried their soup or salad. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the wait staff was very accommodating to our party. They did not rush us, had the food out quick, portions were good, and they filled our water glasses frequently."}
{"text":"Bar is comfortable. Bar staff is attentive. Dining room is a little loud but that just means the table beside you can't hear your conversation. Streaks are perfect and drinks are cold. Always a good bet but make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Service was not up to expectations.   Empty glasses and no refills on water entire time.   It was odd and disappointing.   Food was ok but definitely not worth price.   Big surprise was large sorbet.   Likely to drive further next time to find another spot."}
{"text":"4.5. Great steaks. Ribeye bone in, cooked in butter to perfection. Rates equal to some of the best. The best part about this steak was the char. Nicely done."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. Food is great, service is great, and the atmosphere was what we were looking for. I've eaten here a few times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the Pork Chop with cherry sauce and it was memorably good! Great portions, chop cooked to perfection and the cherry and red wine sauce was sweet and tangy at the same time. I went to Ditka's on the way to the Pittsburgh airport and I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by \"da coach's\" restaurant and pleased that his only location outside of the two in chi-town happens to be in \"da burgh\".  Now, it's been a little over a month since I was here, so I'll do my best to spotlight the highlights.  We showed up at around 7 pm after a long day of on again off again golfing at quicksilver due to the weather.  It's located in the concrete and franchise wonderland that is robinson.  There was about 8 of us, so we didn't know if we'd have trouble getting a seat.  Luckily they serve the full menu in the bar and we were able to get a hi-top for all of us.  I don't remember anything that special about the space except it was what I expected.  There was a lot of dark wood, leather booths and some brass as well as some sports memorabilia of course.  The bar area was a nice surprise since it was a large bar with a few plasmas and ample seating. It's also the kind of place that you would feel perfectly comfortable in shorts even though they are trying to operate in the fine dining steakhouse category.  Our server was a nice gal' who had just gotten back from italy I think.  They had guinness I believe which was good, however I do recall trying a dirty martini with my dinner that was way too dirty. Think they reversed the olive juice to vodka component.  I recall geting the oyster shooters which were fun in that they were raw oysters served with tobasco and maybe a hint of vodka.  And, at $2 a pretty good price.  There may have been other apps' but I can't recall. I do remember Jason getting the sherry crab bisque, which was okay... a little too heavy and salty for me and lacking any discernable crab.  It was exactly the same as Atria's.  I also noticed \"pot roast nachos\" on the menu there must be a connection to the family who owns Atria's.  The bread was great.  It was served warm with delicious room temperature butter.  I don't eat salads, but remember thinking the salads looked great.  The salad had goat cheese, toasted pecans, cranberries and apples.  I took a chance and ordered \"da pork chop\", which was excellent.  The chop clearly had been brined to ensure moistness and was served with an excellent sun driend cherry jus and these killer mashed sweet potatoes (all for $22).  I think Corey had the lamb, which I sampled and thought they were top notch.  Brian ordered the ahi tuna, which was okay I guess, but who orders ahi at ditkas steakhouse.  The steak I sampled was pretty good, better than outback (which I like) but not capital grille,,,and also not capital grille prices.  All in all the prices were very reasonable for the quality of experience here.  They also get the small things right, like the bread and salads.  The sides are pretty interesting too.  I especially enjoyed trying Jason's \"blackjack sweet potatoe smash\" which was served with \"bourbon butter\" and bacon,,, really good comfort food.  I took my girlfriend home a gigantic slice of choc. cake, which I sampled and thought was okay, but only okay if you decide that size doesn't matter and remove the benefit of the ridicoulous portion size.  I also brought her home macaroni and cheese served with bacon.  It was also good, what you'd expect, but quite frankly I'm getting a little bored with the mac n' cheese with add on's.  I'll definitely go back to this place when in the area.  The service was good, food was very good and prices a very good value.  In fact, I've had much worse experiences for twice the cost. Good job coach!"}
{"text":"I have to say, like others, I was surprised that the food was good.  I had the soup du jour (bean) really good.  The fish tacos were also yummy.  The wine selection is okay, but  expensive.  (welcome to Pittsburgh and their mark up on wine)  Ditka's chard was not worth the price. They also have some temperature issues to work out with their wine service.  There were some good Italian choices and decent  CA wines.  All in all, I will go back.  I thought the food was very inexpensive, so it compensates for the prices of the wine.  I found the service really good, but the servers not well educated on the food or wine.  The space is nice, a little upscale, and large."}
{"text":"I went here tonight with a friend while we were both here for business in Pittsburgh. We were staying at the Marriott Airport so this place was close by and I heard it was good. I thought it would be more sportsy type of place given who the owner is but it was more of an upscale restaurant, which is fine. The speciality cocktails were delicious. We ordered a great bottle of wine to go with our steaks. The steak was cooked to perfection and just how I like it; medium well. The red skin mashed potatoes were really good too. The hot bread basket....you'll want to have a basket to yourself because you will not want to share. I'm so glad I came across this place, drove by this place for years and never stopped in until tonight. I'm so glad I did. The staff is amazing and so friendly and food was really good."}
{"text":"This restaurant was great.  It was elegant and quiet.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The crab bisque was awesome.  My husband and I shared a Reuben sandwich with fries meal.  The sandwich was very good.  A very relaxing place to enjoy an awesome meal."}
{"text":"This steakhouse was a very nice surprise on a recent visit to Pittsburgh.  The food we extremely good from the ahi tuna appetizer to the perfectly cooked filet to the delicious sides...jalapeno hash browns were delish!  Our waiter Ron was friendly and helpful and couldn't have been nicer.  My only complaint is that there isn't a Ditka's in Philadelphi!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for Valentines Day. Service was quick. Steaks were also great! I was disappointed that they were out of mushrooms though for a steak place. Cosmo drink was one of the best I had!"}
{"text":"An excellent dining experience  it is what a full service dining restaurant should  be. Great atmosphere. Ron, our waiter made our experience even better. All the employees were fantastic . Food was 5  star!  If you want a relaxed night out please visit the coaches place ."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place! Ofcourse expensive too... We had calamari and bruschetta for starters. The calamari is fresh and well fried. One of the few places that served a crispy calamari. With a drizzle of lemon and the tomatoe sauce they give, this is the best. Bruschetta is like any other bruschetta you find at other fine dining restaurants.    They also serve freshly baked bread rolls. Once you break that bread, you will know that it fresh and the cold butter they serve on the side melts as you spread it over the bread. However, for a group of 7 people they should consider adding two small baskets instead of one big basket.   Coming to the entree, I ordered tortilla crusted halibut and lobster Mac and cheese. I should say that I didn't eat lobster Mac and cheese more than a couple of spoons, not because I didn't like it but the fish completely dominated the lobster Mac and cheese. It is the best well cooked halibut I had so far. It has a nice crust but it is not oily so it feels so light even after eating the entire dish. The corn salsa adds an additional zing to the fish. I should not forget about the tamale. It is so smooth and so flavorful.   Overall, I will consider going back again even it is a bit pricey.Also, other guests in my group liked the steak and seafood they ordered."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, it was pure class and customer service!  Only had to wait 15 minutes, when previously quoted 25 minute wait time.  We were greeted promptly and courteously.  When seated, we were immediately greeted by our waiter.  Our waiter was outstanding!!  We ordered the Kobe Burger Sliders for an appetizer, and they were outstanding!  They were perfectly cooked and the presentation was pleasing.  There was a sauce on the burger, that I can't remember right now, but it was smooth and flavorful!  I could have actually ordered another round for dinner!!  We both had the chopped salad and it was chock full of items, not the chopped salad I was use to.  It had garbanzo beans, corn, lettuce (obviously), tomatoes, cucumbers, and other fixin's, and a very generous portion.  For dinner, I got the scallops, with asparagus, and wild rice.  Absolute bliss...My fiance got the 8oz fillet with the red skin mashed potatoes, and I tired some, and it was very tender, with no fat!  For desert, I got one of the best Key Lime Pies I have ever had!  Throughout the whole dinner, our waiter and support staff were on top of things and great!  I really don't think I have had as great service like this before... I mean, I have had good and great service at many places, but Adam, I do believe his name was, was the perfect waiter.  I even walked out of the place with 2 cigars, and some of the sauces.that are for sale.  Will definately go back in an instant."}
