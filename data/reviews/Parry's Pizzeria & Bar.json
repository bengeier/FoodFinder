{"text":"Decided to try take out from Parry's today. We had had an OK experience with pizza the weekend before. My wife and i both got the Bronx Cobb salad to go. Service was good and order came up fairly quickly. We ordered at the bar.  When we got back home to eat the take out both salads were not worth the $16 per salad. Lettuce was wilted, chicken was a total 3 small strips that was obviously cooked prior too and put in cooler based on how cold it was. Big thing was the avocados on both our salads was hard, not close to being ripe, like eating an apple, so shouldn't have been served. In house made blue cheese dressing was watery with no chunks of blue cheese which made it have little flavor. There was crumbled blue cheese on the salad as most Cobb's have.  They were not busy at 1:00PM for lunch and some quality control is needed. Salads were not worth the $32."}
{"text":"Kelly was a fantastic waitress. It also helped that the pizza was fantastic. Their beer selection is also amazing, with many televisions to watch sports on while sipping on a local favorite craft beer. Make sure to ask for Kelly when you come! Will be dining here/watching games here again."}
{"text":"Great food! Pizza is a little pricey, service was good.  Will be back soon. Samantha is wonderful. Manager stopped by to say hi and that was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Caveat...I'm from Portland OR and a bit of a craft beer/cider snob....Yep I'm that guy taking notes on the printed taplist. That being said I was in Charlotte for a weeklong business trip and while lodged close to Northlake Mall I had low expectation for a good beverage/ food location nearby...think every mall chain cliche establishment possible. Parry's was quick to dispel this notion as they had an exceptional taplist with plenty of local/regional beer and holy heck  local CIDER!  I was made to feel comfortable and well attended right out the gate by bartender Tori, my experience was so good I returned each day for the duration of my stay. Service at the bar was consistently outstanding, informed, friendly and professional. Every food option I tried was perfectly servicable with no complaints whatsoever. As a business traveler whom was working nearby this absolutely fit the bill as I was able to sample a vast variety of the local beer/cider scene paired with good food and great service all from one convenient comfortable location.  Highly recommend you check this place out...especially on Wednesday when they have tap takeovers and local makers hosting tastings."}
{"text":"Craving their parmesan bites so much right now!! They're so yummy. The portion size is large so definitely share with your friends for this appetizer.  Pizzas are all incredible - the crust is cooked just right and the flavor is amazing.  They have a TON of beers on draft. Lots of TVs to watch sports at the bar. Servers were working very hard and were so kind - they smiled all night long and were so engaged!   Parking is shared with the Northlake Mall so on busy nights, you might have to park far away."}
{"text":"First visit. Went with a friend who wanted to try the wings. Started off with the fried mozzarella. They were triangle shaped and when I sliced into it with the fork I discovered it was mostly a shell of bread crumb. We cut open another and found the same.  Sent it back.  Friend ordered 10 piece wings which we planned to split but found out you cannot split the sauce between the wings unless you order 20 or more so we ended up with the barbecue.  They were just ok to me.  I'll continue to get them from East Coast Wings across the street for now. I ordered the veggie calzone and added pepperoni for    $.99.  It too was just ok. Saw an extensive list for those who enjoy beer, I do not. Staff was friendly. Despite being located at a mall entrance, it was relatively empty for a Wednesday evening.  Probably won't make it back.  Funny, I never went when it was formerly Brio either."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, menu isn't typical, I really like the beer selection.  Service is good."}
{"text":"This place exceeded our expectations! The pizza was fantastic, my husband and I had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza that came out with a nice crispy crust with quality tasting ingredients. The service was fantastic. Beer was plentiful and reasonably priced. Overall we were quite pleased and would go back the next time we're in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I'm a native New Yorker and I've been struggling to find a decent slice of pizza for the past decade outside of the Big Apple. You can imagine my amazement when I bit into that first slice of pizza at Parry's and tasted a little bit of heaven. The temperature was perfect, the crust was thin and crisp, the spices and herbs were just right, and the sauce was tangy with just the right amount of sweetness. I'm amazed that we stumbled upon this place just after they opened. This is definitely our go-to spot and well worth it in every way!  Also, our server, Diane, was the sweetest! She explained everything to us and brought me at least 6 of their beers to sample before selecting the best one. Not to mention, they have local breweries come in on Wednesdays to showcase their beers, and they have great specials throughout the week. I just can't say enough good things about Parry's! What are you waiting for? Get out there and try this place ASAP! You can thank me later :)"}
{"text":"The greek salad was AMAZING!!!! The service is great and fast! Def coming back!! Going to try all the salads!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza spot! The pizza is top of the line and the staff was super friendly! I couldn't of been happy enough about my last visit! Everything was top of the line."}
{"text":"One of the Best Pizza places around!!! Whatever you get, make sure you get cream cheese on your pizza. Game. Changer."}
{"text":"We wanted to try somewhere new for dinner. Let me tell you we were severely disappointed. The food was mediocre and the service was terrible. We waited almost 10 minutes before anyone came to acknowledge us, which was the hostess after I called out to her. Our waiter, we'll call him Gaston (he never gave us a name and had a French accent), did not greet us at all but just asked \"What do you want?\" After dropping off our food we never saw him again except when he was getting someone else's food. The pizzas that we had were on the same level as Little Caesar's or Papa Johns. The best part of our experience might have been the fact that had Cheerwine and the fries we decent."}
{"text":"Super great service. Impressed with the beers on tap and cleanliness of the establishment.  Had a bartender named Jameson. He was pleasant and knowledgable.   Pizza is not great pizza but edible- its comparable to Dominos or Papa Johns. Sauce is too sugary. Crust is frozen premade.  If you want real ny style pizza- Tonys and Davincis are still the best on this side of town.  Anything tastes good when you are starving and having beer. But still a fun place. I think I found my new local hang out!"}
{"text":"Went last night, the pizza was really good. It's new to the area and I can see myself going back. I did order a drink on the menu, and they were out of the main alcohol component for it which sucked. It also smelled like dirty beer rags inside but like I said the Pizza was great and the other menu items looked good."}
{"text":"I suggest u only come here for drinks, great selection, on the other hand the food and service are horrible. For this kind of service and food I might be better off going to McDonald's drive through. According to my friend Kayla, they wings smelled like worn sucks. The pizza had a hole on it and was missing some ingredients. Once again, great place for drinks and horrible place for food."}
{"text":"I guess you can't really expect much from a $5.99 cheese pizza lunch special, that comes with a drink. There was absolutely nothing special about it. However, the customer service was great from the moment I walked in to the moment I left. I would definitely go back to try one of their speciality pies. On the way out, I looked at other orders and it looked pretty good."}
{"text":"This place has very poor customer service.  We went there for lunch, it was not busy was not greeted by a rude hostess that we were obviously an inconvieience to her.  She sat us at a table.  Other tablkes were being served and taken care of.  None if the customers in our section had anything to drink nor had placed their order.  After waiting for 10 + minutes we got up to leave , I spoke wiuyh another waiter concerning our service, he also did not seem to care.   This is one of the worst places I have been to ever.  I don't think they will be there long.  Save yourself some time and go to firebirds"}
{"text":"Great food and Great service! Food was served quickly and the quality was good. Our server Kendall was personable and made us all feel at home. Best wings and sandwich wrap I ever had. I couldn't believe the quality of service we received for the price we paid. Prices were beyond reasonable. We would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Captain Kevin at the bar will do a good job with finding the right drink.  We enjoyed two apps Chicken fingers and the Yankee Fries off the chain and well deserving of the rating. They are still in a soft opening but the service is awesome."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great Service! My party ordered a few different pizzas and I loved them all! Parry's also has an amazing beer selection. I'd definitely recommend stopping in to watch a game!"}
{"text":"After a long day of helping a friend dress for vacay. I walked into Parry's starving. Greeted right away by Jon. It was a slow night so we were seated right away..  I took no time at all to order. Craving from comfort. I ordered the spaghetti. Pasta is bland but the meatballs was great.. Jon check up on us often.. and my tummy was satisfied!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome pizza, very questionable spaghetti.   First off, our server was faaaantastic. She checked up on us often and cracked many jokes even when my lactose friend was giving her a hard time. Also, the location is pretty nice. Attached to the south side of Northlake mall, it has access to a large parking lot with its own entrance from the outside.  Overall, the ambiance and food was very good. Their beer selection was widespread and priced very nicely. Having been in NYC just one week earlier (artichoke pizza omg..), I must say that their \"I love meat\" pizza ($20.99) did not disappoint. It is huge! and was very delicious. Well balanced between the bread, cheese, and meats, and a proper representation of the NY slice.   We also got their \"Big Tuna Starter\" which was very good ($12.99). The arugula was a nice touch as well.   Having said that, what in the world is wrong with their Spaghetti. I have never seen a more basic spaghetti and salad. It looked straight out of my high school cafeteria.   Taste: 4/5 (if you omit the spaghetti) Atmosphere: 4.5/5 Value: 4/5"}
{"text":"We have been coming about once a week since we discovered Parry's in December. This is our favorite pizza in town! And there are tons of craft beers on tap. Some craft beer selections are only $4."}
{"text":"When Parry's first opened they had a great staff and exceptional food.  The owners Jason and John brought NY style pizza to the south!  It's a clean restaurant.  It's full of seating inside and out and it HAD a ton of energy.  They even have a fire pit outside with lots of beer options.  But since it's been open over the past year, the service has gone way down. The owners aren't present anymore.  The atmosphere isn't as lively and we had a server last weekend that came and sat down at our table because she said she was tired. She took our orders while being seated. She got our drinks and our orders were wrong and over charged us for an item she quoted a price on. Didn't bring out to go boxes and said she apologized for not providing good service. I won't return. Sorry. I tried."}
{"text":"This is not New York style.  Thick crust and not full to the edge. $21.00 for a faux NY pizza?  No thanks. I'll go to Pappa Johns for a true thin crust for half the price with equal toppings.  Also if you sit at the bar area and watch a game plan on leaning back to an uncomfortable level to see the screen.  Come on people this is 1917. Make a good product at a good price and make the experience a nice one."}
{"text":"If you have a vertical license, don't even think about walking in to have a drink. Even if it is a valid photo ID and not expired, they will not take it, especially if it is out of state. We got mozz sticks and boneless wings and they were okay."}
{"text":"I only love this place because of Kelly. The most awesome server ev-vah!!!!!!!!!!!  She is nice. She is quick. She is fastidious in serving her customers. Go in to Parry's and ask for Kelly."}
{"text":"Parry's is great! I came for the first time for lunch and service was fantastic-great lunch specials. The next time I came, we had Brandon and he was super helpful and encouraged we try the Parmesan bites which are freaking addictive! It's a must try!"}
{"text":"So on my first  visit I wasn't crazy about the pizza, so my second visit I got the Cobb salad with fried chicken and omg was it amazing! Their ranch dressing is also on point. My husband also got a calzone and loved it."}
{"text":"Giving them 5 stars purely on the excellent customer service provided by Evan & Charity during the lunch hour!! They really looked out for me to give me a better deal than I originally ordered. They were both respectful and courteous without that fake plastered on persona most places have. The food is great as well! I highly recommend dining in!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Amazing beer selection. Tonight was our first time here and we will definitely be back. The kitchen manager came out and asked us how the food was, and it's just so nice to have that personal touch now."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place in Charlotte for pizza and green chili. A taste of Colorado in Charlotte! Great beer selection and friendly staff are second to none. Love their weekly beer specials."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food at Parry's Pizzeria.I was able to try an assortment of the items at my table and here is my feedback.  Garlic Knots-topped off with a nice seasoning,soft and fluffy Calamari-I haven't had calamari this good in a while.It had somewhat of a lemon seasoning on it that made it stood out. Fried pickles-the batter has great seasoning;I can see them becoming addicting I Love Meat and Summer of 2010 pizza-I have found my new favorite pizza(Summer of 2010)!!This pizza has pepperoni,jalapeños,spicy sausage,and pepperoncini.While this may sound spicy,it actually didn't have an overpowering kick to it.The unique combination of ingredients are right on target! Mild wings-I wasn't a big fan of the wings due to the sauce.It tasted more like a mustard based sauce which I did not expect. Calzone:Thumbs up;you even have the option to create your own  I actually have to praise Parry's on whatever technique they use on their fried selections.The calamari,nor the fried pickles,were soggy or greasy by any means.Each piece I ate was perfected and that is rare to find within my experiences.  Setting:Spacious,convenient spot to get a drink after work and watch TV;there is an adequate size room to host group parties"}
{"text":"Great pizza here!! Ingredients are fresh and the flavors are good! Our waiter was super sweet and very accommodating. Pizzas came out hot and ready. They have a great menu to please a large audience and their beer selection is impressive. I had a glass of wine from Italy and was pleased that a beer place had good wine!! Great beer/pint specials here as well!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh. I wasn't impressed. We went on a very slow night and when my food came out it was not hot. I had a sausage Parmesan sub. It was  tasty but not hot. The waitress was awesome. But I dont think I will be rushing back."}
{"text":"This place has become an office favorite with my coworkers and myself (especially so because of a yelp elite event in full disclosure)! Very appreciative to have a place so close to work that serves good food and rather quickly.  Parry's is located right near the H&M entrance of Northlake Mall, directly in front of Firebirds. They have an outdoor patio as well as a spacious interior that has a large garage-style wall that goes up when the weather is nice.   Last week, my coworkers celebrated a birthday here and Brian was our waiter. Brian was an absolute ROCKSTAR and gave everyone who was new to Parry's the rundown on the restaurant as well as a mini sampler of ciders and beers to try for those who ordered alcohol (the beer list is pages long!). He even gave us a little backstory on the brewers.   Our table ordered an array of apps: parm bites, bruschetta, yankee fries, as well as others who ordered wraps and pizzas. If you're in the mood for cheesy bread but not of the ooey-gooey kind, order the parm bites. Fried dough lightly dusted with cheese - can't go wrong!  I can vouch that the pizza is really good (and makes for just as good leftovers) but for my last visit, I ordered the back to cali wrap. The wrap comes with house-made chips. My only gripe is that there wasn't much avocado to be found in my wrap but the flavors were good. The chips were the best part, tbh.  In all, good food and even better service. Give Parry's a try the next time you find yourself at the mall and over the food court!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian pizza I've had in such a long time. Wonderful ambiance and great service to go along with the food."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Northlake's dinning options. Nice looking restaurant, waiting area bar area and lots of tables. We arrived around 1:30 and had there lunch special! $5.99 you get a personal pizza and a soda! What a great deal!! Our server was a tall gentleman with a thick beard, he was awesome! Really made us feel welcomed! Can't wait to go back! Pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"Trying this place out for the first time. And I have to say they make a great tasting pizza. The sauce and cheese are top notch. They even offer a gluten free alternative. Hubby had a French dip....I tried a bite and loved it. Thinly sliced lean beef and yummy au jus. The caprese salad app was huge!! The beer list is 4 pages long so if you're into trying something new they probably serve it. We definitely will be returning. After looking at the menu we have already checked out what we want to try on our next visit."}
{"text":"Parry's is a fairly new establishment located right beside the food court at Northlake Mall. Nice establishment. I went around 4pm. I received a gift certificate for a free 14' medium cheese pizza. I also redeemed the free garlic knots through Yelp check-in. Jumping right into it, the cashier that greeted me needs some customer service training. Her attitude wasn't pleasing. Anyway, she told me after seeing my gift certificate that the manager would have to assist me and they would be able to do so shortly. Well shortly turned into no manager ever showing up. Thankfully there was a Manager sitting with another person at a table close by that was helpful. I told her what happened, and requested that she take my order. My order was taken and it took about 8-10 min. to arrive. Long story short, they went busy at all, there was one table with customers... this would definitely not be a first pick for an outing in the future."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal. No matter what you order it is GOOD!! The beer is stellar. Some of the money goes to a children's charity when you buy their beer. Get the \"Crushing It\" beer - it doesn't disappoint! The restaurant had a nice atmosphere, and the entire staff was friendly and made sure to speak to us (the manager, head chef, bar staff, our server Latasha, etc) from the time we came in until the time we left. This is a great place for the whole family, or if you just wanted to head out with friends. There even appeared to be a private room for events. Check them out!!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Parry's for a beer during a visit to Northlake Mall. The draft beer selection is very good, with most being craft beers. The beer menu is a little tedious to navigate and could probably be rethought. Rather than inviting me to explore the endless number of drafts, the layout made me just want to choose something as quickly as possible and be done with it. This is very minor constructive criticism, mind you.   I checked in on Yelp and unlocked the free Parm Bites appetizer. They came quickly and were very good. It was an incredible amount of food for an appetizer and could easily have fed 5-6 people. We wasted most of it.   We had early dinner plans and were unable to try the pizza, which is unfortunate because they looked amazing. The Son of Sam pizza with pepperoni, jalapeños and cream cheese is right up my alley and is at the top of my list for my next visit. Considering the amount of restaurants in the Northlake area, there just aren't many quality choices. Despite my limited experience with Parry's, I would encourage anyone to give them a try. Can't wait to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Great new place at Northlake Mall. The beer selection is awesome and the food and service was excellent. We had the son of sam pizza. Sooo good with pepperoni, jalapeno and cream cheese! My husband had the ahi tuna appetizer and I started with the ceasar's salad. Lot's of great food at a resonable price. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good craft beer selection and we enjoyed the pizza very much.  It was a thin style crust and the sauce was flavorful. The waitstaff was efficient and very friendly.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Parry's is amazing! From the decor to the food and definitely the customer service! The manager, Johnny is awesome! Knows me by face and name. And some of the employees do too. I'm always greeted with a welcome back. And They always make sure I'm good throughout my visit. Today, Brandon was AH-MAZINGGGG! Made sure we knew we could sample beers, recommended what we should get and what the best bang for our buck would be (even though everything has already great pricing)! Thanks Brandon, Thanks Johnny Thanks Charity & staff for always making my experience exceptional!"}
{"text":"I had the bbq chicken pizza...it was too soggy and gooey for my preference.  That's all I had the opportunity to try though.  Service was nice."}
{"text":"A bit over the top with the Decor, going in I knew it wasn't my kind of pizza. It's very \"chainy\" not sure if it actually is, never heard of Parrys before. My kids liked it but they also eat Dominos. 2 \"pies\" wings and a wrap $70 Not including tip is outrageous. The wrap was akin to Qt or Sheetz. The fries were extra. C'mon  now. We got a free app with the Yelp check in. The Mac and cheese pizza looked so gross but again my kids ate it. This is not N.Y. style anything. Its a sports bar with bar food."}
{"text":"I work at Northlake Mall and I was excited to try a new option for lunch today since our food court is just depressing. I stopped by around 4:00 PM by myself for a late lunch break.   When I first came in, I told the hostess that I'd prefer to sit in a booth that was out of the way instead of the bar since I don't like sitting in high top chairs and didn't want to feel like I was on display eating by myself. They put me in a booth in the back by the kitchen, which was fine until I realized after I ordered that I was right by the unofficial employee hangout area and would have been more comfortable sitting at the bar.  The entire time I was there, there were at least two of them just standing there chatting, which was uncomfortable for me since who wants to face people right in front of you while you're eating a messy sub, especially when the restaurant is practically empty? I hated it, especially when a girl (not my waitress) started ranting about how she was upset another waitress who got to work after her was assigned a table first. I was close to telling her how unprofessional it was to act like that so close to customers, especially at a new restaurant, but I knew that would be inappropriate and bit my tongue.  I didn't order pizza or wings since there wasn't a lunch special for them and they are pricey to order when it's just one person. I asked the hostesses when I first came in if there were any lunch specials going on and one pointed them out on the menu, but didn't find out until I was already seated and asked my waitress that those ended at 2. That's definitely a miscommunication that needs to be cleared up with the entire staff because I wouldn't have asked to be seated if I had been correctly told that lunch specials were over. I stayed because I figured I was already there and should give this new restaurant a shot. I saw on their website later they have lunch specials from 11-2 M-F, but they are missing out on mall employees stopping by on their lunch break since many of us don't go on break until later in the day and don't want to spend $15 on lunch. If they extended it to 4 M-F or even had happy hour specials 4-6 M-F like Firebirds does, that would entice more mall employees to stop by for a quick bite.    My waitress was very sweet and the only thing she could have improved upon was to ask if I had any questions or pointed out anything I should try on the menu. It took me awhile to decide on the Ad-Rock Chicken Parmesan Sub with Chap's Chips. I was disappointed that half of my chips seemed cooked, but when you bit into them, the middle was undercooked and soggy. I flagged down another waitress to tell her since my waitress was at an employee meeting in the back (no worries about that, I know it's hard to get everyone for a meeting at the same time) and a manager came soon to talk to me about the chips. I think his name was John. He explained they try very hard to make sure the chips are cooked evenly and since that's not always possible, they put aside the undercooked ones for employees since they aren't going to hurt you. He was nice and professional and I appreciated how he brought me a fresh side of chips immediately.   The chicken parm sub was ok, but definitely not the best and I wouldn't order it again. There was a ton of sauce and cheese, which is always good, but wasn't very \"chickeny\", if that makes sense. From the menu description, I expected there to be thicker pieces of chicken, but that wasn't the case. It made me wish I'd ordered pizza or wings. I was also charged 50 cents for ranch dipping sauce with the chips, which I didn't expect since the appetizer of chips description states that it comes with bbq sauce, so I assumed a sauce would come with it as an entree side as well, especially since there isn't ketchup on the table. No big deal since I definitely dipped my chips in that ranch, but that should be more clear.   Several people checked on me while I was eating, including three that I presumed to be owners or managers, which is always a good sign that they are active employees instead of being managers or owners who hide at a table in the back and don't really pay attention to what is actually happening in the restaurant. My family co-owned a pizza franchise for almost 13 years and I always pay close attention to customer service and management styles. There is a family vibe about this place that will appeal to all demographics and I'd feel comfortable going back with family or friends.  I'm kicking myself for not checking in on Yelp until I could take a picture of my food because it was too late to order the free check in offer of Polo Grounds Parm Bites! Rookie mistake that I won't make again and if you're reading this, make sure you don't make the same mistake!  All in all, it's a decent new restaurant that needs to work though some hiccups, but none that will deter me from going back. I'm already planning to go with a friend soon so we can try the pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"Tooling around with MLB and wound up here the last night of restaurant week. I dropped my best girl at the door and set off to find a spot for the car; in marked contrast to the drudge and bother of parking at the mall Kendell was warm and delightful throughout our visit attending our needs without much hovering. Waters and menus in short order, we requested the meatball bake and beverages. Herbed cheese and a rich textured marinara over delicate meatballs under the broiler and then hot on the table with garlic breads. I prefer my meats just a little more maillardy. not saying, just saying. For mains we opted for the Pearl (garlic, basil, parmesan, ricotta, tomato, and sausage) which came out splendidly arranged and pie cut. Picked up a slice to confirm doneness (I hate soft wet centers) and got right to nibbling... Respectable (but pistachio-less) cannoli and plain fried doughs finished the evening and we left full and satisfied with a sack o' food for breakfast pizza tomorrow!! The worst thing I can say about Parry's is it's pizza in the style of New York with a seven page beer list. They're a little out of the way but we should make it back."}
{"text":"Loooooove the Lexington salad. It's a must have. The ranch dressing is home made and that's always a plus"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. So much beer on tap!!! Molly is the best server!!!! Prices are great for anything you could want."}
{"text":"Good food and service! I had the calzone and side salad which was very good. My friend had the cheese steak.  The prices were reasonable and the portions were good.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"We stopped in for an after-church meal one Sunday and didn't know what to expect. We were seated promptly and our waiter took our drink orders soon after being seated. We ordered calamari as an appetizer and cheese pizza. Our appetizers came out quickly but it took a little while for our pizza. Our waiter noticed and was very apologetic and went to check on the status of our order, coming back shortly with fresh, hot pizza! I need to say, this pizza was very good! the ingredients were fresh and full of flavor! My son had an order of French fries and he was satisfied. I probably ate half of his fries because they were crispy and seasoned like I like them. The atmosphere reminds me of T Mac with all of the TVs and drink options. My son was entertained with the music being played and all of the TVs so, anytime he's distracted enough to enjoy dinner with us, I'm a fan! We will definitely be back to enjoy another meal. I could imagine that this would be a perfect place to watch the game a catch a drink, but also spacious enough to bring your family. It's a great mix between family restaurant and sports bar, if that even makes any sense, lol!"}
{"text":"They had a lot of taps to choose from. I got the calzone and it was delicious and also got the dessert pizza and was just as great! Our waitress was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great pizza, wings, beer selection, and service. Also very clean. Recommended."}
{"text":"You want New York pizza Go to parry's amazing cheese pizza!!! And you can build whatever pie you want it's great if you want watch some Games or if your just out chillin with friends"}
{"text":"I joined my fellow Elites at Parry's Pizzeria & Bar for the ultimate Pizza experience and boy was it an experience!   The menu has an array of options, the Pearl, the Mea West, the Brooklyn BBQ, meat lovers just to name a few pizzas or you can just \"Build your own damn pizza\" as the menu says!  If you're not in the mood for pizza, no worries they have a full menu of chicken, wraps pasta and just about anything your taste buds crave!   Last but not least after feasting on Parry's heavily topped succulent pizzas if you have any room, you've got to try one of the mouth watering desserts! A few choices were; a 9\" apple pie smothered in a cinnamon sugar and Carmel drizzle, chocolate cake or hot fresh dough balls drizzled in a cherry glaze and powdered sugar (which are a must try)! Everything comes to the table hot and fresh to order!  The servers are great, and they work hard to get everyone's orders correct!  We had the pleasure of meeting Jason (one of the owners) who was working hard in the kitchen  but he still made time to check on us to make sure we were satisfied! Amy the kitchen manager made her rounds to assure that everyone was well taken care of!   Parry's restaurant is very spacious, family friendly and clean (even the restrooms are modern and clean)!   There's a separate room that can easily host an event or party! And they even have balloon twisting and face painting every first Saturday of the month for the kids!  If you want to watch the game, Parry's is the spot, they have plenty of TV's so you can watch your favorite sport while enjoying the fine cuisine at one of Charlottes best pizza spots!   Two thumbs up for Parry's Pizzeria & Bar!  PS Parry's is located outside of Northlake Mall, next to Firebirds and Dicks Sporting goods!"}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite spot... well if I can find a decent parking spot. I will lead off by saying that I didn't order any pizza this visit.   Me and the boyfriend were seated quickly and instantly ordered the Parmesan bites. A brewery from California visited and alley us sample some beers. Since we didn't care for the California beers, the server let us sample some other beers which was nice.   The Parmesan bites were delicious. So fluffy and delicious. The serving size was a lot larger than I thought. We also ordered The Liberty boneless wings with garlic seasoning, the ahi tuna appetizer, and the Murray hill sandwich. All of it was delicious. Call me crazy but I LOVED the boneless wings the most. They were light and properly seasoned. The food overall was just really surprisingly solid. The portions were also spot on with the price point.  Service was great and I appreciated the fact that the general manager was also checking on all of the tables. Empty plates were never on the table long and my water was never empty.   I hope they keep up the great work because the Northlake area can really use some solid restaurants."}
{"text":"Went for the first time, probably won't be back. Pizza is ok, but not worth the price. The pizza looked big when it came out but was paper thin and lacking on the cheese. Normally I eat 2-3 slices at a time, here both of us ate 4 slices to be full. I'm not quite sure why it's $1 more for \"spices\" on a cheese pizza. Shouldn't they all have flavor? Lunch specials were nothing special. Prices are way too high for what it is. I'm not looking to spend $20 on a pizza with one topping. Just another fancy looking mediocre overpriced restaurant. One topping cost $3.50 just FYI if you plan on going here."}
