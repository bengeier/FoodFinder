{"text":"Have been here several times despite the occasional long wait, but we keep coming back, because it's so delicious. Fantastic menu with so many choices. If you're looking for the usual \"diner style\" eggs and bacon and coffee choices, move on. Personal favorite are the breakfast pizzas with broccoli and cauliflower crust. Over the top delicious. Thumbs up to the creative chef for proving that healthy and tasty food really do co-exist and a special call out to our last server Melissa for her patience, knowledge of the menu, great attitude and her skills at helping us take a selfie!! :)"}
{"text":"Server Brittany is horrible! My order was wrong, I didn't eat it and was still charged for it. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Can't give it zero so we will go with one. Waited one hour for a salad. Poor service, continually delivered food to the wrong tables. Will not be back.  Adding an update since I wrote the earlier review quickly. Also because the management asked me to contact them via email to assist. While appreciated, I won't be going back.   The best part of our experience there was the hostess, she was kind, helpful, friendly and efficient. Half of our party got their hot food about 45 minutes after ordering, the other half (we ordered salads) did not receive our food. When we asked the waitress, she acted surprised (she never came back after taking our order to make sure we had what we needed). We went to the kitchen area to cancel our order after 1hr 5min and suddenly our salads showed up at the table. The dressing was not on the side as ordered and it was saturated on the salads. The chicken on the salad was hot, which wilted the lettuce which made the food unappetizing. A staff member came by after an hour to refill our water. The manager was completely uninterested in helping or smoothing out the process, he continually looked irritated. We sat and watched the staff deliver food to the wrong tables multiple times, leaving the food there while sorting it out, then sending it over to another table. People that came in long after us got their food much earlier and many times only 1/2 the party at the table received food, with others having to wait another 15 minutes. Basically, it's a mess that needs a lot of work and a manager interested in customer service. They did end up taking the salads off the bill, for which we thanked them."}
{"text":"Here now and so happy to have this place and so close! Alicia made the best latte - it was hot!!! She steams the milk yeah - I always have to ask. Great energy, ambiance, food. Can't wait til they open in the evenings!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of state and someone recommended I try this place out... so glad I did! My server, Brenna, was a breath of fresh air! Even though it was the early morning, she was so friendly and helpful in figuring out what to order, which was tricky because the menu is fantastic! I went with her first recommendation, the protein pancakes... by far the best I have ever had! Five stars for my server and five stars for the food... wish this place was where I live!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my go to spots, i enjoy everything from the churro waffle to the chorizo hash patty! 10/10 would definitely recommend to anyone :)  Will for sure come back for more  xx"}
{"text":"I/we have patronized BKB four times, trying / sharing a handful of their offerings. Their menu is one of the most interesting breakfast / brunch with something for anyone. The food has been consistent, served timely and hot.   Try it, you'll like BKB!"}
{"text":"It can't get enough of this place. Almost every time I come, there's usually a wait of some sort, but I would gladly wait all day for the good and ambiance. The service is fast and friendly, the food is amazing and the atmosphere is unparalleled. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was quite tasty and plentiful. The only area that needs a little tweaking is perhaps the kitchen. My quinoa salad came out missing three of the items that was supposed to be in it. However, when asking they did bring out a side of the missing items. Also the wait staff could of been a little more attentive on refilling beverages. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First time here! Started off a bit rough with the hostess however... food was great! Spanish scramble add pulled pork and almond croissant french toast were both amazing! Even better was out server Sarah! Very attentive and friendly even got water bowl for our pup! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to BkB.  I was so bowled over on my first visit, which was in the middle of the day with very few tables, and I was eager to brig my son there for a great brunch.  Today, my son and I arrived at 10:45 a.m. on a Sunday, and the place was packed.  Happily we were seated immediately, and soon after ordered our selections.   55 minutes later, I inquired with our server about not getting our entrees. 10 minutes longer, and the manager came over and promised our ticket was next.  20 minutes longer, and the manager returned empty-handed, with more apologies.  All he could offer was that our meal today would be comped.  I just wanted to eat!  After seeing several meals served around us, and tables seated and served after we had complained... our meals came out at 12:20 p.m.. - a full 95 minutes since we were seated.  I am extremely disappointed and frustrated, and it is apparent the staff and management has not been trained properly to gear up to the popularity they are experiencing. It is one thing to have our ticket \"lost\" - stuff happens, but once it was brought to the Manager's attention and a promise was made to get it rectified, the larger crime was in not getting our order out for another 30 minutes after the mistake was realized! Too make matters worse, my son's belgium waffle was cold, but he did not mention it to me for fear I would send it back and he was starving!  I feel for our server, who I do not blame, and did take care of when we left.  However the manager needs a much better control of the kitchen if they expect to last.  I would strongly DISCOURAGE my friends from eating there on a busy weekend, as they clearly so not know how to handle their crowds."}
{"text":"Best blueberry French toast ever, paired with fresh squeezed orange juice... what more could you ask for? BKB has become one of our family's most favorite restaurants, and we go out for breakfast almost every Saturday! The menu has a beautiful assortment of healthy and traditional options, so it is sure to please everybody. Great service in a trendy relaxed atmosphere, with an outdoor dining area reminiscent of French sidewalk cafes."}
{"text":"My mom and I went to BKB this morning. When we sat down, we each ordered one of their specialty coffees. It was pretty great, so we had high hopes for the food. I ordered the three cheese omelette, and my mom ordered the farmers market omelette. As we are eating, a gnat lands right in my mom's omelette. Our server Brittany walks up right as this happens. My mom tells her a gnat just landed in her food. Brittany says, \"do you want me to take the plate from you?\" Mind you, only a couple bites of the omelette was eaten. My mom said yes. Brittany never apologized, let alone offered to make her another omelette.  When we got the bill, we were charged $12 for an omelette that had a gnat fly in it and only a couple bites eaten. I went up to Brittany and asked why we were charged for this. She said and I quote, \"well there was nothing wrong on my end.\" I said, \"well she had a gnat in her food and only took a couple bites of it.\" She replied, \"I guess I'll talk to my boss and see what he says.\"  Again, still not one apology. She brings back the check with the $12 removed and says to have a good day.  We will never visit this place again. Brittany and her boss could have offered to remake the omelette, or at the very least just apologized. How dare she have the audacity to charge us $12. Such awful customer service!"}
{"text":"We went on Saturday at 10:30. After a short, pleasant wait of about 10 minutes, we were seated at a two-top inside. Tables are very close and the noise level makes conversation a little difficult. After about an additional 10 minute wait, our waitress stopped by. When we asked if they had Prosecco or sparking wine/champagne by the bottle, we were told no (contrary to their menu online). We asked about prosecco by the glass - no, they didn't have that either. We are finally able to order \"champagne\" by the glass, but the waitress couldn't tell us the type or brand. We were charged $2 more for straight \"champagne\" vs a mimosa. The $9 \"champagne\" certainly wasn't. It was some form of sparkling wine that tastes more like sparkling cider - sicky sweet and undrinkable.   Due to a \"problem in the kitchen\" we waited well over an hour for our food. I had the South of the Border Benedict. The English muffin was heated but not toasted. The sauce was bland, and slightly sweet. The pork was well cooked but over salted. My husband has the avocado toast. He described it as bland and not memorable. The manager didn't bother to come over to acknowledge the delay and the waitress didn't care.   If you are at all into good food, great service and quality drinks, please  don't waste your time (and money) on this place"}
{"text":"Really good food, drinks and service. Their menu is eclectic and different which is refreshing. Every time I go in I hear that the churro waffle is out of this world. I'm typically a savory breakfast person, so I'm waiting for my sweet tooth to kick in so that I can go back to sink my teeth into these sought out waffles!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love it and the menu \"Looked\" great. Good size portions but the food had no flavor. I tried samples of everyone's dish and they were all very bland . Bloody Mary was decent. I won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"One of the most unique and new breakfast spots in town. Get there early to avoid a wait (before 9am). BKB seems to have something for both the sweetest of tooths (Churro waffle covered in strawberries, Nutella and powdered sugar) to the healthiest of health freaks (substitute quinoa cakes on your benedict for a healthier option, or opt for one of the customizable protein plates where you choose your protein and 2-3 fresh cooked veggie sides (cauliflower and bacon mash while not as healthy is by far my favorite new go to side)). Overall the ambiance is exactly what you'd expect and hope for in the already trendy Scottsdale Quarter. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  We loved the food and the service.  We were there for the first time and although they just opened a few days ago, they did a terrific job.  We had French toast and a steak hoagie.  Delicious!  THANK YOU"}
{"text":"In a hurry that morning and was close to where we were stay and just stopped in for breakfast.  Was okay food nothing to brag about. People working that day were friendly and did a good job."}
{"text":"OMG!  Best Breakfast, EVER!  Healthy choices, Awesome service - THANKS ALICIA!  Had the Famers Market Omelette - out of this WORLD!  Don't miss this HOT spot!"}
{"text":"I love this location and I've sat both inside and outside. The grilled cheese and bacon French toast was really good but I prefer a different cheese. I also love getting eggs and the beef tenderloin. Super flavorful and very tender!  Now I've been here 4 different times and they've all been pretty great experiences. Sometimes the food was slow coming out...but it's always very good. The Staff has always been friendly and attentive.  I've brought a number of people here and everyone's always loved it!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the Valley - hands down.  I ordered a healthy protein breakfast and was blown away by the quality, portions and presentation."}
{"text":"Service was great, the food was terrible.  The scrambled eggs were over cooked, the ham steak was small, the bacon that topped my breakfast pizza was way too chewy.  Waitress was awesome though!"}
{"text":"Long wait, small space between tables, food took forever and flavor was nothing impressive"}
{"text":"Their text waiting system didn't work in our case so a 20 minutes wait ended up much longer. We finally asked why others after us were being seated and they claimed we were texted.  Asked for two waters and two Latta coffee drinks. Waters had food particles and the Latta drinks were room temperature by the time we got them.   They said their kitchen was running behind which we were fine with. But the food we got was also room temperatures which means it was not a kitchen issue and it was a food service issue.   The food was ok and probably much better if it was served hot like it was supposed to be.  Best of luck."}
{"text":"Just ate a lovely spinach quinoa salad here and then threw it all up when I got home. Now have food poisoning. Lovely"}
{"text":"A great concept, but not very well done. Classic Benedict was cold and flavorless. They forgot the waffle and when it came out late it was missing the fruit and whipped cream. The waitress brought out grapes instead of berries. No offer of a refill for our hot tea. Just seems like a chain type of place where no one cares."}
{"text":"Service was good. Flavor was just okay. Overcharged on credit card. I would agree on noise level and lack of sound abatement."}
{"text":"My 2 stars are for location only - it's conveniently set in the Scottsdale Quarter and it's a super cute, airy place with plenty of outside seating.... but that's where the good ends.   We arrived around 10:30 on a Friday and it was surprisingly busy. The first thing I said to my husband was \"hmm, no one is eating\". That should have been a massive red flag.   We were seated outside within 5 minutes and a server greeted us and asked for drink orders. 30 minutes later (literally) we received just my toddlers milk (from the hostess, oddly), nothing for us. The server came back shortly after and I said we were still waiting on water. I wanted to get in our food order then, but before we could say another word she ran off all flustered. Weird...   Then maybe 5 minutes after that, the buser came out with our waters. We still hadn't order food 40 mins after being seated. Then the manager, Rachel came out saying we would be getting a new server and she took our orders. She was apologetic and knew it was unacceptable. The food came out within a normal amount of time after that (maybe 15 mins?)   I got the farmers market omelet as a scramble with hash browns. The scramble was fine, but nothing special. I did not care for the hash browns (I think they had some kind of cheese in them, but it kind of just made them weird and soggy). There was fruit on the side but the strawberries had that old appearance when you cut them several days prior. My toddler got the smores waffle which sounded good but wasn't - the waffle was gummy and tasted like it was made with one of those \"complete\" mixes. My husband had eggs Benedict and said it was as described.   The new server really only showed up to drop off the check. Nothing was comped, which I felt something should have been considering how crappy the service was.  Also, other tables I was listening to seemed to have even worse service than us! Wrong orders, meals coming far apart, etc.   I thought being ran by the same people as pita jungle they would have a bit better of a process, but yikes. Too many other good places around."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to once again order a great breakfast this morning to go. I usually speak with Brie over the phone who is awesome. Gets my order done right every time. She repeats it back makes sure I get everything I need and then rechecks the order prior to my taking it to go. The food is excellent and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Waited for an hour today and left. Love the menu and had heard good things. I may go back if they aren't busy. Had to wait for a table even though there were plenty of open questions tables."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend who was in town for the weekend. Service was ok...our waitress made it a point to tell us that the food takes longer than usual to prepare because all food is made from scratch, but then it took her an additional 30 minutes to come take our drink order then an additional 40 to get our drinks and take our food order. The food was good, but not out of this world."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The atmosphere was modern and so cute. The food is absolutely delicious. We had a party of 5 and everyone loved their meals! Our server Lexi, made our experience even better. That being said, perfect everything. I recommend Breakfast Kitchen Bar and definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Currently sitting at the restaurant...been seated for 20 minutes and not one person has come to my table to take any order what so ever. It's like I am a ghost. Service is the worst I have ever seen will not be back"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot.  So refreshing to have healthy and delicious breakfast offerings.  Not only is the food great but the vibe is good as well.  :)"}
{"text":"Don't go here really hungry. Waited 30 minutes for a table, almost another 30 minutes before the waitress took our food order and another 30 mins to get the food. Bit ridiculous! Food was good but the special drinks were not what I expected. The peach belini had way too much sugar on the glass which was hard to remove and the bloody Mary hard bacon around the rim. All a bit much and we were not warned about it...   I will give them another chance but will pick a different time next time."}
{"text":"Told 25 min wait 65 min later seated waiting over 40 min from seated for our food drinks are dry and no service. Bartender doesn't know how to make a decent Bloody Mary wish we had gone elsewhere..and well the food wasn't all that took it home $75 later and threw it in the trash."}
{"text":"Today I had the blueberry French toast it is way overrated and the service was just decent"}
{"text":"Excellent menu. But really poor service. We had to wait for a long time . And the host responsible for seating was not very friendly."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! I got the almond croissant french toast and felt like I was on cloud nine. There were so many great options to choose from on the menu, and the staff was also very accommodating! Perfect place for breakfast/brunch with family or friends!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast burrito! Busy on the weekends but you can walk around the quarter while you are waiting."}
{"text":"Semi Pleasant experience at BKB. Sat at the bar and had some mimosas while waiting for a table. Alisha and Sarah are great bartenders and very personable!   The only disturbing experience was watching a server and what seemed like a Busser raise their voice at the bartenders which made it extremely uncomfortable and seemed very unprofessional.  Over all The food was amazing."}
{"text":"This is amazing for breakfast and absolutely PET FRIENDLY!  We had the blueberry French toast, lox and bagel and a side for us and a side of pork sausage for my furbaby.  Everything was delicious and the OCD iced coffee was so tasteful.  Our waiter Brie made our first visit here an unforgettable one.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Great service.  Fun to watch the kitchen and staff expeditor was really efficient. Food was awesome. Fresh ingredients.  All the plates looked beautiful. Coffee was delicious. Will come back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious brunch!  Blood Mary was great and the avocado smash bowl was excellent!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Went with my mom and 2 year old son today and won't be back anytime soon.  After being sat by the friendly hostess, we waited more than 10 mins for a server to stop by. When she did come we put in our drink and entree order to get things moving. They got my sons grilled cheese kids meal out quickly which I was grateful for. About 20 mins later, my salad was put in the pass window. It sat there for 20 mins while mom moms entree was prepared. 20 minutes! So when they served it, it was soggy, lettuce was warm, and medium rare steak was cold. My moms egg entree, the eggs were cold. So I asked for the manager 2 times. Despite knowing we asked for him, he was taking his time. So Joe, the manager, comes by and I gave him my feedback for the whole experience. He did not seem to care and we asked for the check for the kids grilled cheese and left. Lots to figure out here before I'd go back."}
{"text":"Have been twice, once just after they opened and onceca little later, as a second chance.  We tried it again because we figured the staff was busy working the opening kinks out the first time we visited.  The takeaway: if you have time to kill, this is good food that might be worth the wait.  The service on our first visit was slow but the food was good.  Took about 15mins to get coffee and another 35-40mins to get food to the table.  The second visit: it took the staff 20 minutes to get coffee and ask us for our order.  It took another 35 minutes for the order to actually reach our table; 55min wait for food .  Nothing crazy, we're talking an omelette and some pre-made \"just heat it up\" food.  The pre-made \"just heat it up\" food was refrigerator-cold in the center and the omelette had the wrong meat and the wrong veggies.  The coffee was decent and I might have consudered a third visit but there is an actual (and good) coffee place just a few storefronts away and they serve breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and setting! Very professional and friendly servers and the food is to die for... LOVE the pastrami sandwich, churro, breakfast burrito and the hash pizza!!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place for the following reason.  - overpriced  -up charge for just about everything, including maple syrup for you waffle. $2 for a small maple syrup. extra tea bags and any other basic items that cost them probably 5cents.   No so nice :("}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 4 stars, nice restaurant, modern, indoor/outdoor seating plus an outside area. Waiter was pleasant but a bit inattentive. I ordered the farmers market omelet and the hubby ordered the grilled cheese Bacon French toast. Sounded great on the menu but just fell short on the execution. The omelet needed something, salt helped but still bland, nice fresh veggies though. The French toast was dry, did not appear to have been dipped in the obligatory egg wash. Also would have been better if the bacon was on the inside so that it could be eaten like a sandwich and not with a knife and fork. We may return at some point as it was very pretty."}
{"text":"The food is very good and the atmosphere is great. The servers are very attentive and work in a very professional manner. I really liked the taste of the food. Two good items are the classic cheese burger and the original buttermilk pancakes. These two dishes that I had were great. I loved the presentation of the dishes as well."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday around 12 and there was a 45 min wait,  which we were expecting so we didn't mind.   If you don't want to wait,  I'd suggest coming around 1:30 as it started to die down...plus happy hour starts then ;)  The menu is amazing and I had the hardest time deciding,  but   finally went with the protein pancakes and they did not disappoint. I especially loved the ricotta whip on top... it was mild but delicious.   My husband had the shrimp scampi omelet.   He usually says his meal is ok, but this one  he said was exceptionally good and if we come back he'll be getting the same thing,  it was that good.   We will definitely be back,  there are many other dishes I want to try and I'm guessing they will be just as good as what we had."}
{"text":"This was great. Really good scratch food, nice service, good outdoor space. We will come back."}
{"text":"Great environment and service. Good was fantastic and fresh. A lot of options - especially if you're trying to stick to a certain way of eating - low carb, high protein. Highly suggest coming here. Subaru at 9am and we were seated immediately."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and brunch spot! Great service and delicious food! The avocado smash is a great healthy option and the churro waffle is incredible!!"}
{"text":"Waited for 40 minutes after ordering food to then ask waitress politely when we would expect our breakfast. The waitress returned to say they forgot to put the order in and would we still like to dine there. Ultimately, the food served was not what we even ordered."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! The red mango tea was fantastic! Great variety! All of the dishes were amazing! I got the eggs Benedict with salad and all was delish! The atmosphere is amazing! The staff is FANTASTIC! We will come here any time we are in Phoenix for amazing breakfast!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today and it was amazing! The hostesses were very welcoming when we walked up and the wait was a lot shorter then expected. A very classy and warm atmosphere! The patio is beautiful for the weather in AZ! The owner, Sam, was very attentive and kind! Our server Brittney was very energetic and recommended a ton of wonderful dishes! We took her up on the Breakfast combo bowl and the protein pancakes! Super filling and so yummy!! You HAVE to try this place! Way to go Sam and BKB!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Breakfast Kitchen Bar, located in Scottsdale Quarter, for the first time this morning.  There was no wait for a table inside which was nice, the outside seating looked nice but it was a bit hot to sit outside, even with the misters going full blast. I liked the atmosphere, cozy and welcoming.  We enjoyed our meals, I had the breakfast sandwich consisting of scrambled eggs, applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, tomato garlic aioli, mashed potato hash browns, and avocado relish on a brioche bun which was plenty of food for me.  My husband had the South of the Boarder Benedict which included poached eggs on an English muffin, green chile pulled pork, onions, avocado relish, and hollandaise which he said was delicious.  We also took advantage of the special of three cocktails for $16/per person which basically works out to the last cocktail being free (cocktails are $8/each). I had peach bellinis and my husband had classic mimosas. They were yummy and definitely a good deal.  Our experience was made that much better by our server, Samantha.  She was professional, friendly, and attentive in a non obtrusive way. Rather than wait forever at Snooze across the street, we'll definitely be going back to the Breakfast Kitchen Bar."}
{"text":"I was searching for spots to have breakfast, and came across this restaurant. To be honest, I was only looking at the photos that were posted until my mom pointed out that this place only had 4/5 stars. I ignored it because the menu sounded amazing. We got there and I could not have a single bad thing to say. Our server was Jamie, who was super sweet. The restaurant was super clean, very experienced workers, the food came fast, and their menu is VERY accommodating (especially for vegetarian, gluten free, KETO, etc.). Overall, the experience was a 10/10 thanks to Jamie."}
{"text":"Great find in the quarter! Everything was amazing. See pics. Flavors were on point. Drinks were delicious. Tried the spiced mule, orange marmalade margarita, Irish coffee and mezcal drink. All exceeded expectations. The mezcal drink needed something but if you enjoy mezcal you'll still like it. The smoked salmon breakfast bowl was tasty and the churro French toast was absurd but worth it. Service was stellar. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here and really enjoyed it! Got there at 11:30 on a Saturday morning and didn't have to wait for a table! The place is very cute and has great indoor/outdoor seating. Would recommend sitting inside unless you get there very early due to summer heat and the misters not really doing enough to keep you cool at noon. The food was great- I had the breakfast burrito bowl and it was a ton of food! My friend have the avocado toast and really enjoyed that as well. They make everything to order so our waitress gave us a heads up that it would take a little while but we only waited 15 minutes for our food after we ordered. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I am REALLY not one to write reviews, but this deserves one. I love Breakfast Kitchen Bar and their food, but was extremely disappointed and angry when I called to see if they make group reservations. Now I know they don't take reservations normally, but some restaurants do take them if they are for big groups and this would be for my birthday with about 7 or 8 people. After the lady who answered the phone said yes to my request of a group reservation, the phone got handed over to who I am assuming was the manager. He repeatedly told me that it was \"impossible\" for me to do something like this because \"people are not going to show\". To begin with, I wouldn't have called to make the reservations unless I knew the amount of people confirmed. I wouldn't say 10 when I only knew 7 were going to show. He was downright rude to me during our conversation which has turned me off of this restaurant for good. I would give it only 1 star but the food can be good if you order the right thing."}
{"text":"I really had to go and try this place with bunch of my friends, i have to say the coffee was crappy & the food was ok. would i go back ? NO sorry !  EA"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here while on vacation in Scottsdale.  The location in Scottsdale Quarter was very convenient for us.   I enjoyed the Pancake Bowl which was on a seperate menu of new items.   It was basically pre-cut pancakes, sausage, and bacon topped with two fried eggs.  I enjoyed it getting it all in one bowl.  The portions were great although there was so much that I couldn't quite finish all of it.    My wife got the Almond Croissants.  She ate all of them and said it was delicious.    We were able to sit outside on a nice April morning which made the entire brunch that much more enjoyable.  Our waitress did seem to be a bit stretched covering our table in the front along with several in the back.  We were in no rush so it was fine with us and it looked like few were in a rush for a quick meal here."}
{"text":"BKB! Breakfast Kitchen Bar-By far the best place in Scottsdale Quarter, you won't find a better breakfast spot in town.    My chicken avocado salad was fantastic! They use great lettuce, the chicken was cooked to perfection, the dressing-delicious.  This place doesn't hold back- the portions were so generous, I couldn't believe how much they gave me!  The waitstaff were so nice and welcoming- not u your typical experience- exceptional!  The owner stopped by to greet me and asked how my meal was.  Another little detail that is rare these days but appreciated.   This place and Pita Jungle are my favorite spots.  You can clearly tell the owners and management know what is important to having a great meal.   Thank you."}
{"text":"Might wanna update your site to match the hours of the actual location.  We came at 2:10p and the hostess goes oh we close at 2:30. We said well the site says three and she goes oh we changed it yesterday... guess the new place doesn't want our business. I was really excited to try it and knew we had time since the website says three. I've worked in the restaurant business for years, and if your open you should still be seating people. We had plenty of time to order a small meal before closing. This left a bad taste in my mouth next time I'll prob just skip over this place.  Edit. We came back within their new hours that still aren't listed and it was good. The food was good and the service was good too. The portions were kinda small for the price but overall I'd come back. There's other places I'd pick before here for breakfast, but overall I'd come back."}
{"text":"Worth the wait on a humid, hot, Sunday afternoon. Perhaps some of the best huevos rancheros I've ever had and the shrimp scampi omelette was over the top...an explosion of flavors. Great service, great coffee and definitely return visits are planned. A home run!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal.  Everything is fresh and not greasy.  Great spot to bring your work and eat a healthy breakfast.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The food was so good. You could tell that it was made fresh and with high quality ingredients. Can't way to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is damn delicious y'all. I came in here and told my boyfriend I was on a last minute brunch whim (PLEASE, I was definitely planning this since last week) and found the true meaning to be delightfully sauced.   \"Two Bloody Marys, please\" = A double fist consisting of two delicious Bloodies coated with a maple syrup glue and bacon garnish (I mean, really?) yum.   We ordered Chilaquiles with pulled pork and their Blueberry French Toast for a sweet and savory combination. So, let's get down to it: there is only one reason I gave this place four stars and it was because the Chiliquiles was made with a red chile sauce (which I clearly missed because I was basically already tipsy before we even decided on what we wanted to order). I guess this whole time I thought a red sauce-adorned chilaquiles was a non existent myth but here we are... Anywho, If they came out with this dish, VERDE STYLE- the possibilities are endless. Imagine me, every Saturday around lunch time, getting sauced and eating Chilaquiles! Take it as you will, I am very pleasant when sauced. If BKB never decides to come out with a verde style Chilaquiles, the least they could do is really drown the chips in the red chile sauce and serve the dish with a lime. I personally think that the sauce to chip ratio was lacking.  The French toast, however.. Game changer. I have had bad experiences with french toast at so many places because it has just been so dry, and then they serve it to you with the tiniest bit of maple syrup... POOF it seems your waitress has disappeared and does not return till the end of your meal and you didn't even get a chance to ask her for more. On the other hand, BKB's French toast was warm, moist and dressed in a blueberry sauce with ricotta honey whip on top. The amount of maple syrup set on the side was actually perfect because it didn't need much work and could even (dare I say) be eaten without!   Other options on the menu include more french toast, breakfast & waffles, classic breakfast items, healthy options, and more. Lots to choose from. They even have smoothies.  -Located in the Scottsdale Quarter Shopping Center -Good date spot -Great service -Good for brunch  -Free parking"}
{"text":"New fave breakfast spot, super cute decor, nice patio, great service. Love the protein pancake and avocado toast. Happy hour specials look awesome, NEED to go back for that. Ask for Brenna, she's the best, prettiest, sweetest girl working there!"}
{"text":"Great new breakfast spot! We stumbled across this place when snooze was crazy packed. I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was HUGE. Great price point at $10. The ambiance was good as well with the design and music. I recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I really loved how this place had different flavors on their menu, and there were a lot of options that were more for health conscious eaters. I had can't remember what I had lol, but it was very fresh and yummy. In the back, my brother had a pork eggs Benedict which he said was very good too. Great fun place!"}
{"text":"It has been too long since I was here, so this place clearly needs to enter the rotation. The food is creative and has large portions for reasonable North Scottsdale prices. On this visit, I went with the Philly cheese steak breakfast bowl, which is unusual in itself. It was basically a Philly without the bread topped with two eggs any style. The meat and bowl were good, but you just needed to add some pico or hot sauce to make it perfect. The breakfast burrito was huge and loaded with lots of items including bacon and black beans. On weekdays, you don't get that free coffee in paper cups, but it's three bucks for unlimited refills. Nice staff and great food."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place out. Finished some Lululemon yoga at the Quarter and definitely felt the need for brunch. Walked over around 11:35ish and was told there was a 25-30 min wait for a table for 3. They take your name down on a piece of paper for the waitlist - no buzzers or text messages to alert you that your table is ready. We wanted to wander around while waiting so we took the risk of not being able to know if they would be there when our table was ready.   Definitely a busy Sunday around noon. Our server was super busy and the hostesses seemed to triple seat her section so it was a while before we got our drinks. She did acknowledge the slow service which we appreciate and understand.   Our tackle ordered the pastrami sandwich, peach & caramel French toast and the breakfast pizza. She told us that the breakfast pizza would be two hash brown patties. Made me wonder why they would call it a pizza when it didn't resemble one. More like potato cakes with bacon bits and eggs. We were a little disappointed with the presentation but it was still a decent dish. Not sure if we would order it again - it's basically the ingredients of a normal egg breakfast but stacked on top of a hash brown patty.   The French toast was yummy but once again, nothing to really write home about. The peaches and caramel sauce comes on the side so that the French toast doesn't come soggy (but they forgot ours until we asked). Maybe we should've listened to the table next to us and ordered the grilled cheese French toast with syrup soaked bacon bits.   My boyfriend ate the pastrami sandwich by himself and said it was pretty good. Also said he would get it again.   Three meals + 3 mimosas + bloody Maria = $63. We believe they had reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I think this is my new favorite breakfast place!  I had a protein pancake bite bowl.  Protein cakes, pb, berries, gf granola, no syrup but a delicious banana purée on top.  Gluten-free!  I am a happy camper.  My husband had the smoked salmon dish.  Great wuality ingredients. A little pricey but wuite the treat."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Kitchen Bar, located in the Scottsdale Quarter, adjacent to the Grimaldi's Pizzeria was difficult to find because the GPS brought me to H&M. We went for brunch on a Sunday and the two main garages were full. Valet services were available but I ended up parking outside of the Scottsdale Quarter and walked to the restaurant. The restaurant was packed but the servers were attentive. The food came out fairly quickly.   I had the shrimp scampi omelet and shared the churro waffles. This was my first time having shrimp and goat cheese in my omelet, and I liked the combo! The churro waffle was well presented and the taste was unforgettable. The waffles were dabbled with cinnamon and Nutella. Sold yet? It tasted as good as it looked. Overall, a little pricey but this place was in an upscale dining and shopping area. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Nice fashionable place. Wait staff excellent.  Wifes eggs COLD , toast COLD, my pancakes were good.  bacon came out missing a piece. OK, they are busy but no reason fro poor quality and missing food.  Will go again, probably not."}
{"text":"Good food, nice environment but terrible service. Service is slow, food comes out late, coffee come, no spoons for mixing cream and sugar in coffee and couldn't find waitress. At end pen with no ink to sign bill and had to hunt for waitress to find another pen."}
{"text":"Delightful brunch spot located in a very well laid out shopping center. We stopped in to get on the list and then wandered around while we waited. Great, friendly service and delicious food. Lots of healthy options, and more decadent choices for the sweet loving crowd."}
{"text":"Food looked amazing as it came out to other tables. We had 15 minutes of just staring and drooling at other people food because nobody came to our table to greet us, give us water or take our order. We left....."}
{"text":"Trust me, the food is not the reason as to why I'm not giving full stars. Wish I could give them a 5 but the staff was not at all friendly. Service was a slow, waitress was rude, and they overcharged one one my friends and acted like it was his fault.   On the other hand, the food was SO good! I was drawn the churro waffle and it tasted like I was at Disneyland. So much cinnamon and sugar and perfectness. My friends also got the almond croissant French toast and Oh. My. Gosh. It came with a cream on top and a maple-almond dipping sauce. I will for sure be getting that next time.  Wish the service was better, but that won't stop me from coming back cause the breakfast was just too dang good."}
{"text":"This is just what Scottsdale Quarter needed!  The atmosphere is great and the food is even better!  I will def be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered this place thru Uber Eats and the food came hot and yummy! The eggs were poached to perfection too, even after a 20 minute car ride. That says a lot about their cooking. The food was very tasty and delicious, great flavors and seasoning. Ordered them again thru Uber Eats for lunch and had two salads, yummy again! Great portions and lots of healthy, feel good options. Looks like I found my new favorite place! Can't wait to actually eat there."}
{"text":"The BEST food in the world. I once ate here 3 times in one week.... I spent $90 on just breakfast food that week. THAT IS HOW GOOD THIS FREAKING PLACE IS. Honestly I feel as though I deserve some type of compensation just for being so loyal. Everything is good. Nothing is bad. Everything is unique and flavorful. The coffee is even better then regular coffee"}
{"text":"When road-tripping, we always like to try new restaurants.  Stopped into this place for breakfast right as they opened. The place was nice.  A take on trendy/upscale.  We ordered the breakfast burrito and an order of pancakes.  The burrito was huge and my wife loved it.  The pancakes were good.  Sprinkled with powder sugar and topped with fresh berries.  They were not the best cakes I've ever had, they had a nice flavor that made them enjoyable to eat.  I would certainly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great breakfast or brunch in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great location!  Service was really slow.  Took 15 minutes for our drinks to show up.  Asked if I could sub a croissant for the brioche bun on the breakfast sandwich and it came with an apricot croissant...jam gushing out and everything.  Yuck!  Also, menu said \"with hash browns\" and they came ON the sandwich, not a side.  Weird!  Food has great potential, but was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmm.  I had the Breakfast Burrito bowl which was overflowing with eggs, chorizo and avocado.   My friend had the basic Benedict and it was poached to perfection.  What a cute spot. I'll def come back next time I'm in town from Vay-Guess."}
{"text":"This is a new breakfast place in Scottsdale Quarter. When the food is prepared correctly it is amazing! The issue is \"when\" or \"if\". Service is OK. Today's experience was the worst. When it came time for the bill the waitress shorted everyone with the change. She didn't say anything when we asked her about it she walked away came back with change and said she had to go find change. One bill was $16.15 and she gave $3 back the next was $15.43 she gave $4 back and another bill was $15.85 she gave back $3 luckily I paid with credit card so my amount was correct. This ruined it for everyone. The feeling that you are getting ripped off doesn't not sit well. Unfortunately don't think we will be back. On another note I wanted to purchase a gift card before the meal and use for the meal and the manager would not let us use it today he said I would have to wait for next wine. I guess not an issue now as I don't believe I will be returning. Company policies need to be reviewed and kitchen needs help! I welcome the management to contact me to discuss."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch and the three of us all loved our very tasty, healthy food.  We will be back!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Once again wish I could use half stars. It is a good 4, but the extreme noise level dropped it a  half point.   The service was good and all the staff super friendly  The food was exceptional. The croissant French toast was amazing.   To balance the super high carb load I had a token poached egg.  The egg was poached well.   The spiced chicken sausage sandwich was good. The combination was complimented the flavour of the chicken sausage.   All in all a good brunch.   I will return"}
{"text":"My new fav breakfast/brunch place! Coffee is terrific; food is great; service from Brenna was excellent! Prices are reasonable and selection is diverse! Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"Awful service. Waited 15 minutes for water, after we had already ordered drinks & breakfast. Those then came shortly after our waited dropped water off. Had such a hard time even leaving a tip for the lady taking care of us, but being in the business & seeing the owner sitting at the bar, enjoying his coffee while the place is decently busy, it's hard to ever want to come back to such a poorly run place. Although the server was busy with 4 tables, in her section, there's no excuse for this kind of terrible service. Probably won't ever come back, but wish him & all his female servers the best. Wish I could say sorry."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong choosing from their menu, and great service.  Always ask what your server recommends, they have great and honest insight in the best way."}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere and the servers are so friendly, not to mention the food was delicious! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Awesome! So happy we found this place. I got the pancake protein bowl and it was incredible. It's chopped up protein pancakes, fresh fruit, granola and peanut butter drizzled on top. I can't remember what my mom had but it came with the organic chicken sausage, and I can easily say it's the best sausage I've ever had. The cups of coffee are huge and the coffee tastes great.   The staff was friendly and helpful. The place itself is super cute with fun decor and a beautiful little patio facing the street.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast/ early lunch place in the Scottsdale Quarter. Great variety on the menu including gluten free and vegetarian options. Staff a bit overwhelmed as this eatery fills up quick from locals and shoppers. Avocado smash bowl was amazing with perfectly poached eggs."}
{"text":"First time here.  Was excited to try this place. I have it 4 instead of 5 stars because it seemed like my waitress was a little forgetful. She forgot about my wine and I had to ask about it. But after that everything else went smoothly. I ordered the chicken avocado salad. It was very flavorful and delicious. The amount of chicken breast they serve you is very generous. Great place, would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Although I haven't actually been into the physical location, I've gotten food multiple times via GrubHub. I (mostly) really love the food here, really I do, and I don't like to leave a 3-star review on places I love. I've always been happy with everything, however this morning upon receiving my order -- The Farmer's Market Omelet as well as the OCD Obsessive Comp -- I was less than impressed. The omelet definitely looked better than it tasted as was quite bland and my latte (OCD Obsessive Comp) was only 3/4 of the cup full. (#sadpanda) Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but when you pay $4.50, plus tax and delivery charge for a coffee, you would expect a full cup of coffee... was I expecting too much? Needless to say, it was quite disappointing. It would've been noticeable had it been spilled by the GrubHub driver, but no, it was just not full. Not cool.   On to the food... Typically I order the Breakfast Burrito, which is one of the best I've had in town -- I don't know why I decided to order something different this morning; kinda kicking myself for that. I mean, the Farmer's Market Omelet did fill up my tummy, but my tastebuds were not as happy. I should've stuck with the Breakfast Burrito, which is delicious and HUGE! You could feed a small family with the amount of food and deliciousness you get with the Breakfast Burrito.   I did call BKB to explain the situation/my disappointment and spoke with Sam, who was kind and apologized for the inconvenience, and stated that he would note my account and make up for the coffee next time I go in. Ok, I suppose that works."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place for a brunch spot. I shared the churro waffle and breakfast quesadilla. I recommend splitting the waffle, although being delicious it's way too sweet to eat the entire thing yourself. The breakfast quesadilla was unique, it was a normal cheese quesadilla but with all the breakfast foods on top (eggs, salsa, bacon etc). The service was good and our waitress was friendly and accommodating. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The patio is disgustingly filthy. South of the border Benedict was pretty good. Others in my group were unimpressed with their food. The fresh squeezed o.j. had a floater piece of black plastic. Spent $70 for 3 meals, no alcohol. Save your money and make breakfast at home."}
{"text":"The Kitchen Bar is Scottsdale's newest breakfast joint located in the Scottsdale Quarter! I was super excited that they finally decided to put in a breakfast/lunch spot! It's more of a laid-back/hip type of place that has both indoor & outdoor seating. I came with some girlfriends for a Sunday brunch and we did the typical brunch/cocktails! We all ended up sharing so I got to try a little bit of everything! I ordered the avocado toast with sunny side up eggs and a Raspberry Sorbet mimosa. It was delightful. I ended up getting a green smoothie to-go! Some of my girlfriends had the berry lemon drop for their cocktails / mimosas / bloody Mary's, the \"basic\" Benedict, Churro Waffle which is topped with cinnamon sugar / Nutella / vanilla ice cream & fresh berries. The blueberry French toast which was topped with ricotta cheese / candied pecans / fresh berries / raspberry sauce & a honey whipped blueberry sauce. Yum!  The farmers market omelet was super tasty and filled with lots of veggies like sautéed spinach / cherry tomatoes / zucchini / artichoke hearts & more! The chicken avocado & the berry quinoa salad were also super good! Overall the food + service were spot on!Looking forward to spending my next Sunday brunch there"}
{"text":"Service & food is always great! Kristen has been my server multiple times & is always amazing and very attentive, I had to leave her a review!"}
{"text":"As an Italian citizen, I have had 5 star dining on the streets of Rome and Palermo. I have always longed for this kind of quality to come to the valley...until BKB arrived. Combining Old-World taste and fresh ingredients with New-World fusion recipes, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. I am excited to come back!"}
{"text":"Overall a great experience. Our server Brenna was awesome. She was very welcoming. The menu offers so many varied options...from sweet to savory, lots of vegetarian and GF selections! We enjoyed the patio seating, nice to be outside away from traffic. We'll definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Awesome menu and the food tastes Awesome-er!! Ha ha! Make your taste buds happy and eat here!!"}
{"text":"Horrible and disgusting service. I would go pick up food from them whenever I worked around the area, I had enough with the service, last visit. I will no longer go to this restaurant that the manager does not even care about how his employees treat others. I have been calling the manager for the last 2 weeks in regards to the disgusting service I received from this young lady attending at the bar. I was on an important phone call when I went to pick up my food, I laid my card on the bar and waited for this young lady to run my card. She gave me a receipt with it and i thought she had ran my card. She had the audacity to rudely almost yell at me why I put the card and the receipt in my pocket assuming I was not going to pay for the food. I just waited for her to run my damn card, grabbed my meal and left. I work too much to spend time right there fighting. I have tried contacting the manager but I guess the manager does not care because whenever I call he's never there or I just get told to leave a damn message. For the young lady who treated me as if I were stealing the food, please spend more time learning how to treat others than spending too much time acting foolish at work doing stupid decisions and to fix her makeup for work appropriate. I will no longer go to this restaurant until service is almost perfected. I feel disgusted and ashamed of a restaurant located in Scottsdale to treat customers like she treated me."}
{"text":"Great place for unique breakfast items. Amazing portions!!! Like they are huge!!! Only bummer is the service is slow but the staff is really nice. Cool ambiance but a bit packed in.  They have a \"healthy\" menu that caters to the gluten free, vegetarian and vegan. Which is awesome as I'm gluten free! I've tried both the breakfast pizza which was okay, not really breakfasty and the power pancakes which were amazing! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"All we could say was WOW! This place does not disappoint at all. We got there fairly early on a Sunday and had no wait at all. I was tempted by the Bloody Mary and honestly it was one of the stiffest and best ones I've ever had. I ordered the frittata and every bite was exploding with flavor. All in all one of my best breakfast experiences ever and I can't wait to go back to town to try it again!"}
{"text":"Tried this on a whim with my wife. We have some dietary restrictions that this place was able to meet very well. We both went with the protein plate, but with different selections and enjoyed the food. It's not spectacular, but it is good. So why the 3 stars? Simple, the coffee sucked. I get that I may not like every breakfast places coffee, but this was atrocious. Burnt flavor that seemed like it was on a burner in a truck stop for 24hrs."}
{"text":"I've never been a big breakfast person but I truly love this place. The menu is unique and yet it's has some of the best traditional dishes on the menu.  You can come here 7 days a week for a month and still eat something new everyday. If you are gluten free, you are in luck because the menu offers so many different dishes. This place can become addictive so beware. So yummy and so good!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Avocado fries are to die for and breakfast pizza and burrito were amazing!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast locale. Good food and service. Open and modern design with plenty of tasty options to choose from. Go early for optimal experience."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch to celebrate a team members birthday - ambiance is really nice but they need to get their act together.  Service was horrible and restaurant wasn't even full.  Timing from the kitchen was atrocious, we had 5 people at the table, food came out, 1 person at a time with a good 10 min lapse between the first plate and last plate served at our table.  This makes it very difficult to have a nice lunch when people feel uncomfortable because they have their food and no one else does.  My order was the south of the border Eggs Benedict which the green chili pork was amazing but the eggs were supposed to be poached, they were way over done, not even one little dribble of yolk, i let the food runner know, she said she would get me 2 more eggs, she brought them out and again, the yolk was firm as can be; how can a breakfast place not know how to make a poached egg??  Needless to say, i really wanted to love this place but our experience will stop me from ever going back there."}
{"text":"I work in the Quarter and have eaten at BKB with some regularity since they opened. In all honesty, the food product lacks in quality control. When it's good it is very very good. The menu items are delicious, ingredients always taste fresh and of good quality. Yet sometimes items are over-done, are about 1/2 the portion of the previous visit or simply missing elements of the dish. Knowing that, I still gamble and place orders -odds are in my favor.  I've never complained; however, one particular instance my phoned-in pickup order was not ready so I stood there waiting for just shy of 15 minutes. The owner did notice and inquired the status from the kitchen himself. After settling back in my lunchroom, realized my salad was was missing a couple of the key ingredients so I went to return for refund. The owner saw me coming and headed straight to me. Not only did he refund the transaction, I was given a gift card and the most delicious protein bar for my troubles. This level of customer service is appreciated, talked about and definitely assures my return patronage."}
{"text":"Great place in the quarter, trendy and upbeat!  The food was phenomenal and service was outstanding... Will be going there again, can't wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is ok, I haven't had the chance to try to original or classic breakfast. Only very high calorie items, didn't feel so hot after eating there. Wait times are extremely long to get food, at one point I waited 45 minutes. Think I'll stick with My regular breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of the best breakfast/lunch spots in town!! I've been here several times and every dish I've had has been phenomenal from the fiesta quinoa bowl to the avocado chicken salad, portobello mushroom toast and the list goes on! Delicious food with a very warm and friendly atmosphere! I highly recommend Breakfast Kitchen Bar you will truly be missing out if you don't check this place out. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is very friendly and the food was very fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this place. When do come ask for Nicole or Brooke. They were awesome host"}
{"text":"This experience was horrendous from the second I walked in the door today. Our server was disconnected and not very attentive or polite. My friend ordered a Dr Pepper which was lacking carbonation and tasted syrupy. We waited a long time for food. I saw a majority of our order sitting under the heat lamp for nearly 15 minutes waiting until the entire order was complete to bring it out. The cooks should have managed their time better to ensure the food all came out together. The kitchen is kind of open concept so we could see the cooks from our table and I watched as one of the female chefs wiped her nose on her gloved hand and then continue to cook with it. What's the point of wearing gloves if you're going to continue to be unsanitary? As you can see from the photo I attached, my omelette did not look appetizing and I didn't take more than 3 bites. I asked the busboy if he had a manager to send over and he seemed very hesitant and confused before saying yeah let me go see if I can find someone to talk to you. One of the females from the bar came over shortly after that and she was honestly the saving grace. She was sweet and comped my meal as well as my friend's and offered to give us to go drinks. I was surprised that she comped the whole tab which shows they take customer's experiences seriously. We still tipped our server well considering how poorly she tended to us. Most likely won't be back.. they should probably step up their game considering all of the competition in the Kierland area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for brunch with my girlfriends! The protein pancakes and breakfast quesadilla are my two favorite options. All the food comes in large enough portions to share and I definitely recommend doing so! The only reason I took two stars away is because I have never had an \"excellent service\" experience. Waitresses have been short and snarky on several occasions, there was even a time when a hostess kept forgetting about our group and letting new parties in to sit despite us waiting for an hour for an outside table.. just to sit us at an inside table right by the bar where servers were constantly squeezing by with food. Very uncomfortable. The food is amazing and the atmosphere and location is great. Just wish they could work on their people skills."}
{"text":"I've been here about 40 times in the last year and I have to say the service is Amazeballs! If you're not a fan of an attentive wait staff and a breakfast that is on point, steer clear of this place. I usually get the oatmeal or yogurt parfait which isn't the most fanciest of breakfasts, however, it's consistently good here. Oh, and try the BKB coffee...expresso, carmel, and almond milk...life changer  Ok, maybe not a life changer but if you're not happy after you drink this, fire me."}
{"text":"Went there around noon and the place was moderately full but we managed to get a table inside without waiting. The waiter came up immediately and got our orders in a timely manner and checked up on us regularly. Coffee came out first then our Belgian waffle then after we scarfed it down (seriously it was THAT good) our benedicts were ready.  The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars was because my coffee basically tasted like sugar and one of my eggs benedict had barely any pork on it compared to the other one. I would definitely avoid the \"vanilla sunrise\" if you don't like your coffee with a lot of sugar. You can still order a latte, brewed coffee etc. off the menu, according to our waitress. Definitely would go back again to try their churro waffle and their cocktails!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!! It's in the Scottsdale shopping area and was 0.5 miles from where we stayed at the Westin Kierland!  Firstly, they have inside and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating is very, very cute. It's am American Brunch spot, but the outside is reminiscent of a classy French restaurant. The inside seating is very open and fun.  Anyway, talk about an extensive menu with splurging items to the healthiest but tasty food you can get.  I split the avocado toast with chicken sausage with a friend and got the churro waffle. FYI, the waffle comes with ice cream and Nutella and it truly is a dessert! Also, it's very true to a churro in that the WHOLE waffle is coated with sugar. It can be a lot for one person and I couldn't finish it. Definitely a pre or post brunch dessert to be shared. But definitely worth getting!  The avocado toast was amazing too - had a hint of lime and the chicken sausage was phenomenal on it.  They really have a lot of great healthy options! It's a spot that goes to show brunch can be indulged in without being too extra!"}
{"text":"All bagels are not created equal.  I was craving for a bagel this morning before my 1.5 hour meeting.  Went to BKB for a bagel and side of bacon.  When we arrived there were 3 customers, not including us.  I ordered a plain bagel with creme cheese on the side and a side of bacon. Simple right?   The order took about 15 minutes, not exaggerating.  One of the waitresses heard us talking about how long it was taking.  She went to check on the order.  She came back with the order. I didn't check it, it was a simple order - bagel and bacon. Walked back to my office, my meeting starts in 15 minutes and the bagel is BURNT!  I mean BLACK with the burnt smell.  This bagel went thru 2 employees - the chef/cook and the waitress.  Neither looked at this bagel and thought, this can't go to a customer.  I wouldn't have eaten it if I had cooked it at home.  I would have thrown it out.  Don't know if I can post pics here, but I will post a pic on my FB page.   After I returned the bagel. The waitress simply said \"Oh, let me get you another one\".   This time I asked for the ba gel not to be toasted.  Since I had 7 minutes before my meeting was starting.  Rushed back to my office, with my untoasted bagel.  The bagel was a little stale. I ate half and just simply threw the other half away.  The bacon was good, hence the 1 str.  My co-workers like BKB. I'm not impressed with a place that can't properly prepare a simple bagel."}
{"text":"I loved the vibe here and the staff was really nice. I ate the omelet and it was pretty good. The blueberry French toast is a little much and over loaded with blueberries. I do want to come back and try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"I drive from Old Town to The Quarter just for the great food and atmosphere.  Their homemade protein bar is even impressive"}
{"text":"Our breakfast was amazing, we had the fiesta quinoa bowl, nothing like I ever tasted:  absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Best breakfast food I have ever had. The churro waffle and the blueberry French toast are to die for. This place just opened up so the staff is still getting used to the place, but they still were awesome and made breakfast very enjoyable! The place is nice on the inside too."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! Our table got the Hash Brown Pizza (my favorite), buttermilk Pancakes, French Toast, and Eggs Benedict. It was all delicious! Our waiter was great and we only waited about 20 minutes to get our food. The only reason for 4 stars is because we had to wait 35 minutes for a table when there were probably 5-6 open tables when we put our name on the list. We wanted to sit inside but the wait would have been even longer. Overall it was a great choice for brunch and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome new place we tried today.  Breakfast was great overall and we enjoyed the patio. Our server Julie was amazing and did a great job. We will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch recently and ordered the basic Benedict with the hash cake. Eggs were poached perfectly.  My friend ordered the avocado breakfast bowl which is a new item that our server Chelsie recommended.  The atmosphere is very hip but is a bit overcrowded & loud so can be hard to have a conversation.  We had a ton of questions for our sever and she was very patient and gave us excellent recommendations and service. She was hustling, but was very composed.  I would recommend this place but be prepared to wait 30 min+ on weekends which is the only drawback. I will go back on weekdays with clients."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Huge portion size and delicious food! Protein pancakes and farmers omelet were so tasty! We'll definitely be back again! Worth the 30 min drive for sure."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this one looking for a place to eat breakfast after 12 PM. The food was excellent and the staff was very friendly and the price was right. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"A Scottsdale gem. Good food, service and ambiance. Patio seating in the fall is similar to eating at a bistro in the streets of Paris. Only there are no skinny women smoking cigarettes dressed to the nines."}
{"text":"CONSUMER BEWARE-A group of high school aged girls celebrated a birthday at this restaurant this morning. 4-5 hrs later 3 of those girls where vomiting uncontrollably. I thought it maybe necessary for the restaurant to know this so I contacted the manager.  Instead of asking any questions or showing any concern he immediately said it was not possible to be anything that the restaurant did. He couldn't care less about these kids. I know I will NEVER be trying this new restaurant.  I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. These girls are miserable!!  Best of luck to anyone who does! That manager was rude."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite breakfast places in the valley! I've tried a lot of different dishes, and I've liked everything! The specialty coffee drinks are on the sweeter side (which I don't prefer), but the brewed coffee is great. I've had a smoothie, and it was really good! Pictured here is one of my favorite dishes (Pork eggs Benedict). The patio is beautiful and the furniture is super comfortable. The hostesses at the front door are really friendly, and we've been impressed with every server we've had. I definitely recommend checking this place out for breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try a new place within walking distance...but I think this is a case of not a ton of competition close-by, thus they draw a crowd.  As a few reviews point out, the staff isn't that friendly, just going through the motions...even though I didn't love Snooze, at least their staff seem to enjoy work.  The owner/manager sat at the bar for most of our meal, giving the evil eye to most of the staff and food.  I appreciate that he's on site, but just gave off a bad vibe and staff seemed paranoid that he was present, while at the same time taking up a seat (revenue) at the bar.  Also found it strange that their was an odd number of bar stools, I think an even amount would work better, considering many parties of 2 or 4 were there looking for seats.  Food was trying to be fancy/healthy, but just didn't work.  I'm sure it will continue to draw with location and decor, but I don't think they will earn enough repeat business to compete long term, although I appreciate the effort in the Quarter."}
{"text":"We were very glad we stopped by here. We needed a healthy but hearty post Hike brunch. It's located in the quarter which is nice and convenient. They have a huge variety of options on the menu from light to the huge protein pancake I got. I'd say this brunch spot is a nicer version of Snooze, although I do love Snooze too! They have alcohol as well if AM drinks are your thing. Just don't be like dude next to me and down 3 in 15 minutes, not cool."}
{"text":"I saw some Negative reviews, not sure why. This place was awesome. Our server Brittany was very patient and helpful. Food was fresh and tasteful."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the Scottsdale Quarter. The ambience is spectacular and the food presentation is second to none. The price/portion ratio is superb. The wait staff is attentive. Brenna was a delight. I highly recommend everyone spend a morning at BKB."}
{"text":"Have been to BKB 3 times so far and have had a relatively positive experience. For being a pretty strict and healthy eater, the create your own plates and/or bowl options are right up my alley as they provide a good array of proteins, carbs and vegetable options. The wait time for your food once ordered can be a bit longer than you'd typically like, but considering its cooked fresh to order, that could explain some of it. They were out of the meatless patty last time I was there and being a Vegan that created a little bit of a problem for me, but otherwise, its a place I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place Outside seating is cozy  The menu has lots of unusual and healthy options  The coffee is really good too"}
{"text":"Found this great place by looking on YELP, am just traveling through Scottsdale, this delightful place is in a very 'trendy\" downtown area.  Much easier to find, and FREE parking lots!!  Waitress was genuinely delightful, answered all my \"tourist ??\"s' and was on time every time I needed anything.   She recommended delicious fresh ice tea and brought extra lemon. I ordered \"Huevos Rancheros\" with chorizo......the very best tasting breakfast dish I've had in ages!! KUDOS to the kitchen staff.  Dish was served with breakfast potatoes and a nice dish of fresh grapes + strawberries.   Very comfortable seating next to the outside.... noticed really nice outside seating with coverage..   What a great place to find on a short stay in Scottsdale.  Could not have asked for better food or service.     HUGE PORTIONS!!! A Great Experience!!!   Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"This is segmented right in the heart of the Scottsdale Quarter. They have a new fall menu that touches the southwest and infuses local flavors.  The main menu is well conceived and the structure and pricing reasonable given the location. The patio is beautiful and sits on the main drag.  I had a new item from the fall menu which was the breakfast nachos; huge portions and quite delicious. Built with a base of nacho chips, potato, sausage and jalapenos with an over easy egg on top.   Outside, you sit right off the main drag and shopping is at a plethora along with many specialty shops. Come check it out. I enjoyed it immensely.  Don't forget the eye candy because is spawns all around you here. As we say in Spanish \"Muy Bien!\"  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate #irishcatv2"}
{"text":"So disappointed , went for lunch today at noon ;waited 30minutes for a table even though there were 12 empty tables outside and at least 4 to 5 tables available inside . What gives  ?  I was told by the hostess that they could not overwhelm the kitchen ;well then hire some more people ! Our server Ashlee was very nice , but we were told no avocado toast and all the eggs benedict were off the menu !!! We had tomato soup which was like canned tomato sauce only thicker , we sent it back , the waitress did however take it off our bill a.the rest of the meal was just ok . I don't understand there were at least a dozen waitresses and the restaurant could still not get its act together . I'm hoping these are just growing pains because I was looking forward to this restaurant opening in the quarter ."}
{"text":"The pastrami sandwich was very good.  Very tasty especially with the aioli sauce.  A solid 4-stars.  It would be 5-stars if the shaved pastrami wasn't dried and hard.    Roasted potatoes are okay."}
{"text":"There's breakfast and then there's BREAKFAST. It's hard for a breakfast restaurant to stand out from the rest. This one does just that. During a recent visit, we shared the eggs Benedict and Peach Caramel French Toast. Both were off the charts incredible, especially the French toast.   This French Toast came with a side of homemade peach caramel sauce that was out of this world and accompanied by a dollop of ganache on top of the perfectly crisp yet soft French Toast. It's a huge dish and easily shared, even though you'll wish you could scarf the whole thing.   The eggs Benedict was just as sublime and came with a side of hash browns with cheese in the middle of them.   Everything on the menu looks incredible and the portions are huge. I can't wait to visit again and try more.   Well done to this new breakfast (and lunch) spot!"}
{"text":"My group of 3 had a great breakfast here complete with the protein plate, protein pancakes and one person had an omelette.  The atmosphere was fun and friendly and our server was excellent.  Our server and several other staff members always made sure we never waited long for anything from food to drinks.  The food was very good and we will back to try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! The menu was extensive and had options for just about anyone. I had the burrito bowl and my girlfriend had a south of the border benedict. Both were delicious and left us satisfied. Our server Brenna was fantastic and was extremely attentive from beginning to end. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just sat down for breakfast. I waited for 20 minutes and no one ever came to our table to get us a drink or take an order. Got up and left. Worst service ever! Someone call Gordon Ramsey."}
{"text":"Had the quinoa protein bowl, it was excellent.  Like having a breakfast burrito without all the guilt.  Service was good, I like the atmosphere.  We went mid morning on a work day - so no wait, good service, good food.  Will definitely go again.  Pricing is reasonable too."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast at a reasonable price in Scottsdale. The breakfast burrito is very large the wife and I shared it. Staff was wonderful, food was served quickly and hot. They also have a bar with a few beer taps.  This is now are go to for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Fair prices. Fresh and awesome recipes. Definitely a good one to put on the weekly list of breakfast restaurants.   Plus if you go into Isaac jewelers they have coupons for a free coffee! Give it a try."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday morning early and this place was just simply put amazing. Sat at the bar and had a great meal and phenomenal wait service. Owner came up and said hello and confirmed my order was to my satisfaction. Would highly recommend to start your day at BKB"}
{"text":"My choice in giving one star for my review is based solely on one person, who apparently is the owner. The tall, bald guy who stood in the corner by the bar, looked angry and just stared at everyone. I didn't see him offer to help anyone and the place was busy! He didn't even care to interact with any guests or smile.  The girls at the bar were VERY friendly, attentive and the food was pretty amazing! One girl in particular was enthusiastic as to how well her cappuccino came out and I can't remember exact words from the owner, but it was very rude. Constructive criticism might have been a better approach on coaching your employees, especially when your guests can hear.  It's unfortunate, especially since there is so much competition for restaurants. The food is great, but witnessing that was not worth going back."}
{"text":"A party of three of us came on a Saturday morning. Pretty crowded but we were seated immediately. I was obsessed with my avocado toast. Phenomenal! My husband got the french toast and he really enjoyed it too, just a tad too sweet. My mother-in-law got the scampi omelette and really enjoyed it as well. The restaurant has a cool vibe to it, like industrial modern. I will be back if I go back to Arizona!"}
{"text":"Looks like I have a new addition to my list of favorite breakfast places in the valley. Breakfast kitchen bar was absolutely amazing!! Big menu selection, good vegetarian options for me. It's kinda pricey but kinda expected due to its location and because the food is awesome. Very much worth it. I immediately knew I had to try the farmers market omelet because it was a combination of every vegetable I enjoy, plus goat cheese and sun dried tomato pesto! I got it with the breakfast potatoes, which taste like delicious French fries. The omelet was slightly overcooked but very good. I also decided to go all out and get a pancake and thank goodness I did because that was one of the best pancakes I've had in a while. Crispy on the outside, nice and soft on the inside. My sister got French toast made out of croissants filled with apricots with almond stuff on it. She loved it! They have some cool unique stuff. It did take a long time to get food but they told us this was because they make everything from scratch there. I am totally going to bring more people here haha"}
{"text":"Good, clean food. Lots of vegetarian options at really good prices. The coffee was amazing"}
{"text":"A casual breakfast date with my friends turned into the most extravagant and pleasant experience that I have ever been privileged to be apart of. If you are hesitant to venture out to this staple breakfast joint, I implore you to make the trip. Let me start with the churro waffle. After one bite I could already feel my life getting better. My skin is clear. My crops are growing. There is no war. My grades are soaring. This waffle brought me out of my depression. At the moment I simply cannot muster up the words to describe what a treat my morning was. My emotions are through the roof. Needless to say I will be returning time and time again. I highly recommend you try this place out."}
{"text":"Horrid service. I'm a waitress and I had to walk out after 35 minutes of waiting for my food. After watching servers look at our table and pass us multiple times, and then pick up other tables who just sat down.. take their orders and within ten minutes they had heir food. Ok so after waiting 25 min for a server to even help us we got our coffees by someone different, and then asked for some cream and she looked at us like we had 1000 heads and said \"we'll your server will get that\" ok so we had to wait again.. and then e got creme but didn't have spoons so boom another 20 min for spoons .. and then after all this time the server comes out and says \"I just want to verify your order and the kind of cheese\" so after all that he didn't even put in our order. Ok so we waited more time and suddenly people were leaving who came after us and we still didn't get our food. Then the not so smart hosts decides to open both doors at 8 am when it's 50 degrees outside with clients sitting upfront. This place is an absolute joke. Learn how to run a business and hire good labor. Not cheap labor."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Come EARLY because you'll wait 30 minutes or more for a table. Once seated we've always been greeted with a sincere smile. There was a \"glitch\" in seating; however, the Manger/owner addressed it promptly and added to our experience.  I've been here before could recommend several dishes, all that are spectacular."}
{"text":"This is a newer restaurant, and my boyfriend and I decided to try it out a few weeks ago. Despite being incredibly busy, the food came out relatively quickly, the plates were beautiful, and our server stayed on near by at all times. She was so kind and gave me many recommendations on different vegetarian meals, since she was also vegetarian. The meals were so unique, it was hard to choose just one to order. We will definitely be back very soon to try more of the menu. This place is definitely recommended if you are in the north Scottsdale area, and if you are interested in healthy plates, combined with unique combinations. It is located in the Scottsdale Quarter which is surrounded by awesome shopping."}
{"text":"Had a great visit to the BKB. First off, we had very attentive service. We sat outside, and it was still pretty chilly. One of the staff came out immediately and asked if we wanted the space heater on, which was nice.  First warning - my wife and I like to try a variety of items off any menu, and ordered several things to share. The difficult part is that the portions are massive!  My wife had the breakfast burrito, which she loved. It's easily enough for two people. I had the breakfast sandwich, which also was huge. It also could have fed two. It had eggs, bacon, cheese, avocado and mashed potato hash browns with aioli on a brioche bun. It was delicious. We also ordered a churro waffle, which we asked to be boxed one with we saw how much food we had. We had the waffle later, and it was amazing. It really was more like dessert than breakfast. Simply fabulous.  Great visit to BKB, will go again...and order slightly less food!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed BKB. Their coffee is very good, had excellent service and enjoyed their food. I was disappointed to find out that the breakfast dish I was looking forward to eating...Protein Pancakes...was made with Whey protein powder. I guess you can call it vegetarian but I don't think you should. I had the oatmeal with they stated was made with water and not milk. It was okay. It's oatmeal. My family had the salmon eggs Benedict which was loved and the Gyro bowl which my husband said was very good and was the breakfast special. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend and his family. We were so excited to try this place out! The pics made everything look amazing! I ordered the protein pancakes and loved them! Unfortunately the dishes everybody else ordered were satisfactory at the most. A little disappointed in the experience, but maybe next time will be better. Willing to give another chance. Ticket times were extremely long as well. Need to work those kinks out fast!"}
{"text":"Delicious and super cute restaurant!! We got two of their breakfast bowls - philly steak and tostada - and both were fantastic! Packed with delicious flavor. We also got a Bloody Mary and Margarita which were yummy."}
{"text":"Best selection of healthy offerings for breakfast I have ever seen.  If you aren't into quinoa breakfast bowls they still have eggs benedict, omelets, and biscuits with gravy.  The menu has a lot of southwest selections including heuvos rancheros and the fun to eat churro waffle."}
{"text":"Deserves another visit..  Pros: - Great vibe - Large servings  - Good service - Healthy / Not so healthy options - Great Coffee - Loved the grilled cheese and bacon french toast concept  Cons: - beans and sausage in the burrito was a little salty for my taste (was able to finish my food anyway)"}
{"text":"This place was good.  The menu selection was pretty good.  They had something for everyone.  We ended up here because the first place we went to had a 30 minute wait.  So glad we did.  It's in a mall, so that's kind of not appealing since you have to park in a structure and walk through a mall, but it's worth it especially if you have some food hang ups and want to eat a little more health conscious.  They have a pretty extensive keto menu.  That's pretty awesome.  I ended up eating a cauliflower patty with eggs.  It was amazing. Everyone else ordered the avocado toast. That was meh.  The bread was thin, the avocado was very minimal.  Nothing spectacular.  I mean, if you're charging double digits for avocado toast - it's toast for crying out loud - give a bit more.   They were still hungry after the toast.  I would not recommend that dish.  The cauliflower, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Overall vibe was also very welcoming and relaxing.  Food was all around yummy.  Churro Waffle was sugar, on top of sugar and then more sugar :)  Bacon had a great smoky taste and the pizza looking omelettes was interesting visually and yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent environment, very casual. The food was delicious and the prices are very reasonable and the service was really good. The coffee is tasty! Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for Sunday brunch this week. We got there around noon and, as expected, it was super crowded. Considering how busy it was, we were seated pretty quickly (waited about 20 minutes) and our food didn't take long to arrive either (about 15 minutes). We got some mimosas and an espresso martini. The drinks were all excellent, it's too bad they don't have any brunch deals though because they were a little pricey. I ordered the portabello spinach benedict and substituted the broccoli-cauliflower cakes for an english muffin and my boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito. The food was on the expensive side but totally worth it - the portions are huge (I could have gotten two meals out of mine) and it was delicious. I'd highly recommend this place for brunch!"}
{"text":"Always friendly service, always good food! Go here if you want a good selection of brunch, breakfast, or even lunch! It's close by to me so I go here regularly when I'm not caught up with work in the morning. Last time I got the BKB platter, but the protein pancakes are really filling as well. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Don't let the line fool you ! Well worth the wait for one of the best breakfast selections .  Sat at the bar and didn't have to wait out the linear all. Greeted by the smiling faces of the busy bartender. She was sincere polite and professional. Made some recommendations and they were the bomb !  Breakfast pizza of hash browns ! Perfect !  The manager who also served as expeditor was as professional as they come !  Thanks Joe for ensuring we had a great meal and service. The food was fresh and hot upon arrival. Taste was delicious and well worth the anticipation.    I will be back no doubt.  Respectfully, Ric Lopez"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast! I had the French toast and it was amazing! Dad has eggs Benedict and he loved it as well. Loved sitting outside and enjoying the weather and scenery. Waiter was very friendly and very professional. Perfect place for breakfast! Also pet friendly which I love!"}
{"text":"I've known the owner of this place for many years since he originally started one of his first restaurant in the desert ridge area... I had not tried this yes,  because I really have not eating breakfast because I'm not really into that unhealthy stuff I can't eat... This is one of the most awesome menus they put together... It's got a combination of everything with a nice gourmet flair ... Very cool kind a like a cheers and I think the Power protein pancake bowl is basically the best thing I've had for breakfast in a long time... Highly recommend you try it"}
{"text":"I had breakfast with a friend and enjoyed this spot. The outside patio is inviting and relaxing. Their spin on Eggs Benedict is a tasty version, especially if you have the cauliflower 'muffin' instead of bread. The coffee is good!"}
{"text":"So excited this spot is finally open!!  Such a unique concept....breakfast/lunch/brunch/daydrinking/tapas/dinner!  You can do it all here. Beautifully decorated, with a great patio, it has everything one wants when nursing a hangover while drinking mimosa's. The menu is extensive and unique and has options for super clean eater's and plenty of options for those days when you don't count calories (ie: churro waffles)!!  The service was excellent and I look forward to eating my way through the menu!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely happy we visited BKB this morning because it did not disappoint. I got the chilaquiles and hubby got the grilled cheese bacon French toast.  When we got there, the restaurant was pretty packed but we didn't have to wait long to be seated. Our server was friendly and the food was good. The chilaquiles could use a lot more cheese but I still scarfed it down. The French toast was no joke - it looks and tastes like a heart attack waiting to happen. I took one bite and we really didn't finish it because it just was too much.   We were sitting next to a sweet male and female duo. They kept giving us friendly smiles as we had our 7 month old with us. Anyway, we asked the server for the check and the couple next to us had left. The server then came to us a few minutes later and told us that our neighbors next to us thought we look like a happy family and wanted to pay for our check. That was one of the sweetest things that strangers have done for us we were so touched. I told my husband that there is this \"Random Acts of Kindness\" foundation where you spread random act of kindness for a stranger like pay the person's check behind you while you're in drive thru at Starbucks. The foundation believes that acts of kindness will change the way people experience and see the world. He was so inspired that he said he would like to do that for someone especially since he goes to Starbucks every day. Anyway, not sure if the couple that paid our bill will ever read this review, but if they ever do, \"Thank You! You really made mine and my husband's day and you truly moved/inspired us to pay it forward.\"   So, if anyone is reading this - be inspired and spread an act of kindness to a stranger to make their day and inspire them to pay it forward."}
{"text":"What a place!! Best breakfast/ lunch place in Scottsdale. It's was busy but well worth the wait. I had the farmers market omelette and my friend had the grilled cheese French toast with bacon. They were both amazing. I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"The menu consisted of many unique choices Finally decided on breakfast quesadillas and protein pancakes both were generous in portion and flavor.  Not to mention the attention to detail in presentation was spot on right down to the sangria.  A bit of a wait but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast after a hike on a Tuesday morning.... I had an awful experience. My waitress did not know the menu and told me the cauliflower pizza was an actual breakfast pizza. I went ahead and ordered it. It took 45 minutes for my order and the place was dead! When it came it, it appeared to be 3 patties that were drowned in grease with pesto on top. I sent the dish back as it was not as the menu described at all!!! I then ordered avacodo toast as it it safe. 20 minutes later, no breakfast. I ended up leaving. Awful service, awful food. Do not go here. Plenty of better places around like snooze or press. This place needs a bit of an overhaul. It's no wonder they are all over the news trying to get ratings."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. It's so cute and the menu looked mouthwatering. However since it's new I am going to give constructive criticism and hopefully give it another try later on.   We got there for breakfast on Sunday at 7 right when it opened. Literally the only ones in the restaurant and service was slower than slow. I mean it took over 10 mins to even get waters. Our server was spacey and forgetful. And the menu... there were literally 3 different ones!! So confusing! What the heck is this about? My advice is to narrow it down to 12 items and master them perfectly. No brunch place needs 40+ items. The menu descriptions were so good and the food was disappointing and very bland!!!! I was bummed. Portions were good but who wants a huge portion of tasteless food?   The highlight was the presentation of my friends mimosa"}
{"text":"If this review was based on the food that I have tried here (once through a catered brunch and just today in restaurant) I would give it 5 stars but never in my life have I had such awful service. The restaurant was about 3/4 full, later morning breakfast, it started off ok, we got water and our drink order and then our food order, relatively quickly. Then 30 minutes went by no food, no waitress. Then finally waitress comes over and admits she got distracted and forgot to put in our order she has done so and it should be out soon. 20 minutes later manager brings out our food, one order was correct and the other completely off. So he leaves to correct this mistake . Finally,  after another 15min, mom gets her correct breakfast. The original waitress comes by to apologize and check on us, tells us she will get us refills on water and tea, but yet again she disappears and we never see her again. Never got those refills. The manager comped our breakfast because of the whole mess but I won't be going back anytime soon. With all the breakfast places in Scottsdale I know I can get great food and great service elsewhere"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to eat breakfast at the Scottsdale Quarter/ Kierland area. I can't say one thing about this place that isn't good. Everything on the menu from food, desserts, fresh fruit cocktails, the coffee and their freshly squeezed orange juice. Wow just wow, I give this place ten stars. Truly Love it every time. Make sure to check it out. You won't find yourself going anywhere else in the morning."}
{"text":"BEST service, quality and consistent food served in a very relaxing, inviting atmosphere -inside or out! Worthy! Repeat customers! Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"We came for a hearty breakfast before setting out on our drive to Sedona. It is a nice modern restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter with a lovely patio.  The menu has so many amazing and healthy options, plus a seasonal menu to choose from. There are plenty of vegetarian and gf options but no vegan options. We all started with fresh squeezed orange juice which was sweet and delicious. My son had the pumpkin pancakes minus the ice cream, but it was still more a dessert than breakfast with the sugar, caramel and nuts. He left bed it! Hubby had the cauliflower broccoli cakes (which have feta in it) topped with pesto, cheese, tomato, sausage and eggs. It was too big a portion for him to finish. I had the avocado smash bowl which had the cauliflower/broccoli cakes (no vegan option so I had this) topped with tomato, onion, avocado and egg. It was tasty but too big to finish. Hubby and I should have shared this. I really wanted the protein pancakes made with oat flour, flax, etc, but it had whey protein in the mix so I avoided that. The staff were friendly, the restaurant and washrooms were clean and service was good but food took some time to arrive. Bill was $60.45 before tip."}
{"text":"The food, service and location were all perfect. When in the area, we will def go here again!!"}
{"text":"very delicious. Had a breakfast bowl which was fresh, creative, and healthy loaded with guacamole.  Would highly recommend this. Bring an appetite as the servings are generous in a healthy way. Way to go Breakfast Kitchen Bar. Quality food and service."}
{"text":"Mothers Day. As a restaurant it's a time to shine and be prepared for an overflow of guests. This is how a restaurant becomes excellent. We were told 40 minutes, was sat at 60 minutes. Food took another 36 minutes. Not ideal. Staff was overwhelmed, restaurant became dirty with an abundance of stuff everywhere....I saw the kitchen too....disorganized, I assume because of the amount of people. However, if it was run efficiently this shall never happen. Plan for an army on Mother's Day, don't apologize, take responsibility for your poor planning. Food becomes less important when waiting this long. It's the whole experience."}
{"text":"We have eaten at restaurant several times and ordered through Uber eats and post mates for those lazy days . I cannot say enough good things about  bkb. They offer something for everyone . I am on keto and a lot of my friends eat very healthy . We ate at bkb last weekend ,ordered avocado sweet potato toast burrito bowl and other items . Everyone loved their food .   For those on restricted diets .Last weekend I had the keto pizza and today had keto pancakes delivered. . Both were phenomenal and fed my cravings for something naughty ."}
{"text":"Was so excite to see this place open...finally. Love their menu but they have some major kinks to work out. We were sat and ordered, food came out however no silverware. Waitress told us, she'd be right back...which right back to me means going and grabbing them and coming right back. Well no silverware, on top of that, my order was wrong which happens but just compounded everything. Waitress returns and asks how every was tasting...well still no silverware. She again said she'd be right back and never came, so eventually we had to ask the hostess for some which at this point we were just fed up with the whole ordeal. They did make it right however, so their is some redemption, but really wished the manager came over. I guess at this point I'd rather go across the street to Snooze. Hopefully the next time I come back they are a little more put together."}
{"text":"So so yummy!!!! Amazing service and a really good atmosphere with delicious food and has really healthy options!! The server Jennifer was so sweet"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  We had an amazing waitress, the wait was not too long for a Sunday morning and the food was delicious! Me and my friend shared the peach and Carmel French toast and the breakfast burrito and it was soooo good! Huge portions and they also have great coffee! Our waitress was really sweet and took good care of us! I will definitely be back and bring my friends here!"}
{"text":"Newly open 3 months ago according to our waitress.  Great ambiance, very hipster and delicious healthy menu. Thanks goodness to the new creative American chef generations that they are very creative in creating the new kind of healthier American foods.  I had quinoa tofu bowl it's come with egg ( your choice) mine was well done fried egg, delicious! I also had green ice tea was so fresh and perfect for a hot day.  The outside setting is cute, but I wish they would use real plants like herbs instead of silk leafs.  Service was good, there were 3 girls that were on duty at the outside tables and they are nice (Julie was very helpful)."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It has a great location and tons of brunch options. I was excited to try it since it is close to where we live but I will not be returning.  I understand it was a busy sunday morning but taking over 10 minutes just to get a water after you order a drink is unacceptable. My boyfriend ordered an iced coffee which came out hot then the waitress apologized and sent it back which took another 10 minutes just to get the correct drink.  It was time to order and we were debating between fre ch toast or eggs. My boyfriend has a SEVERE nut allergy like he will go into anaphylaxis if there is any cross contamination. Seeing there was nutella and peanut butter on the menu made us anxious but the waitress and kitchen manager reassured us it would not be an issue so we ordered our food in confidence that this would not be a problem. 30 minutes pass and no food. Other tables have been sat after us and already have their foods and are finishing up. Finally after waiting, we get our food and there is nutella all over one of the bottom pieces of french toast. If he would of bit into that, he would of gone into respiratory distress. This sent us over the edge because how can you be so careless with a food allergy?!? To top it off, we spoke with the manager who I highly doubt was the manager because she was blaming the customer the entire time instead of apologizing and trying to make it right. It was just an overall awful experience. We will be keeping our business at Snooze across the street."}
{"text":"Been here three times in a week; would've given it five stars, but this last visit was less than ideal. But first, the positive. Wade was amazing - I asked for their gyro breakfast bowl. He was delightful and recommended I try it. Loved it. Service was exceptional. Second time, I asked for the avocado smash bowl with salmon to go. Amazing. Third time I brought two guests with me because I raved about the place. Sadly it didn't live up to my expectations. Server disappeared for long periods at a time. Our food was cold, portions were not consistent with previous visits. Elio saved the day with his quick thinking and disposition. Only good thing about this last visit was their pear bellini. Avoid it on the weekends."}
{"text":"Eaten inside once and ordered takeout twice. After waiting for what let like an eternity (they took far too long to open) for a good breakfast place in the quarter, I would rather cross the street for Snooze. They forgot 3 things on the 5 meals ordered for takeout and my first order (when dining in) of a breakfast sandwich arrived cold. I, too, had to wait for silverware when I dined in."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! I was super excited to get my plate of food because there was enough to feed me and another adult. Food was delicious and at a very good rate!! I would totally come back and recommend anyone try this place! All server were nice and all smiles! We ordered three coffees, three meals and order was 32.00. Very reasonable and not expensive at all! Great job!!"}
{"text":"I took my out of town relatives here on Saturday morning, and it did not disappoint. My niece got the kids French toast stuffed with PB and J, sister got the bacon and grilled cheese French toast, brother got some Benedict bowl thing, and I got the sweet potato bowl. I am vegan so I got my bowl without the eggs or bacon that were suppose to come with it, and subbed for sautéed spinach and avocado. Our waitress was very friendly, and the atmosphere was fun. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place out as I'm a breakfast/brunch fanatic. Let me just say they did not disappoint. Ambiance was great and our waitress (Taelor) was very attentive. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable on the entire menu so she suggested some delicious eats! It was so good that I even ordered a to go order. Can't wait to head back here and try the rest of the menu! Fast, friendly, attentive staff and delicious! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I really want to like Breakfast Kitchen Bar, I really do. I work in the Quarter and it's very convenient to go to for a quick (using that loosely) lunch. However, the service and quality of the food is very inconsistent. I've found my go-to item after the 2nd visit, and have ordered it 3 times since. The first time, the bread was burnt. I'm not sure how that made it past the cook, the runner, and the server, but it did. Wasted $9. The second time, we were back to the original quality - it was delicious.   I just went to get a late lunch, after 2PM, today. There weren't a ton of people given it was in between meal rushes, yet, it still took over 20 minutes for my food, which, okay, I'm fine with. I should've called a head. So I gave my order, she reads it back as she's putting it in, even stating \"no aioli\", which was great - as horseradish is not my cup of tea. I paid cash for my meal, and the cashier just thought it was fine to give me the paper money change back, not even bothering to give me the change. Again, not a huge deal.   As I sit for said 20 minutes for my food, I noticed that the bartender didn't wash her hands as she proceeded to grab fruit out of the garnish container with her fingers and either squeeze them into drinks or put them into drinks. Yeah, this is where \"no big deal\" becomes a big deal. It's gross to know she's touched dirty money and credit cards over and over, and yet continued to handle food without gloves or tools. She then asks me to sign a credit card receipt for her... I paid cash. So after I get my food, I get back to my office to sit down and enjoy my delicious sandwich, only to find the aioli on it. So, another wasted $9. So frustrating.  BKB is saved from 1 star by those 2 times I had a good sandwich though. Once they get consistent and hygienic, I will consider returning."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is amazing, has a big city vibe to it. Clean and with style! Food was good just a bit high price wise. Service was great!   Will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is sooo cute! It's a little small, they have garage doors which add a nice effect, but we all know that Arizona is just TOO hot. So I would've preferred the doors being shut. The food was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. They don't have any special pancake toppings which I was surprised by. Fresh squeezed OJ was delish. I'd go back to try more things!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit at this location. I believe we arrived around 11am and there was 25min wait, unless you were comfortable sitting on the patio. The inside has an open concept and a bar. We were hungry, so we decided to sit on the patio. It was hit out, but there were plenty umbrellas over each table. Our server was quick and attentive. It took a while to get our food, but we were in no rush.   I had a vegetable omelette with potatoes and a side of fruit. My husband had the same, but he added chicken sausage to his dish. It needed a little salt and pepper, but it turned out to be pretty tasty.  We already have a couple go to breakfast spots, but we'll be back to try the mimosas, smoothies, and french toast. This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was mediocre and slow. This would have been a five star review had the service been at the same level as the food."}
{"text":"We had our managers breakfast meeting here and it is now my new favorite breakfast place!!  Service was fantastic and the food is delicious!  Ambiance is on point!  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this place, and the food was amazing. Their chicken avocado lime salad was delicious. Light on the dressing and very generous with the amount of chicken. Also their side, French toast slice, was great! Flaky toasted bread and not soggy at all. The wine here was crisp and refreshing with the salad. The service was a little slow but all in all, a very good place to eat at."}
{"text":"I love the unique menu. Breakfast is my favorite. Their coffee beverages are also very good. I have enjoyed everything I have had from here. Good environment and good food with healthy options!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, and management. Even though my food was a little late, and they forgot my cheese I will definitely go back. Rachel went above and beyond to make sure we left happy, she is GREAT, very important to take care of your customers."}
{"text":"Service was great and the inside was nice . The food was tasteless  and disappointing. Our table tried about 6 different dishes and wasn't satisfied .  The platting and presentation was nice but I wouldn't waste time waiting 30 minutes for food that was bad and flavorless. Waste of 60$ for two people and same for the other checks ."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant!  Best breakfast in Scottsdale.  Unique menu options. Many choices.  Fresh, high quality food and great value. Try the cauliflower broccoli cakes as a base for your Benedict. The protein pancakes are the best I've had.  Everything is delicious and healthy. Service has always been great. Love BKB"}
{"text":"2nd time here , both times food was fantastic, great presentation and generous portions .  For Breakfast we sat outside . They had large heaters(and misters) for comfort. I did notice the music was louder when we had breakfast outside than lunch inside . There is glass between inside and out that opens up for an all open area . Very casual atmosphere and beautiful decor .   The staff was attentive and extremely cordial . Everything was extremely clean . The kitchen is fairly open . It can get noisy but I think that adds to the establishment.   The food - wow ! I was really impressed with all of it . The presentation was outstanding. HUGE portions. At first I thought the price for a burrito was high until I saw it . Bring a hearty appetite or you'll be taking a lot home .  The breakfast items each had these little touches that added so much flavor . The burrito was a monster. The avocado crema made the burrito. If it's not on your dish ask for some on the side . Roasted potato , avocado relish and cojita cheese made it delicious. The farmers market omlet was also ver good . The artichoke hearts , sundries tomato pesto and goat cheese were just parts of a perfect combination !   The salads were SO good ! The grilled vegetable salad had a fantastic lemon vinaigrette. The steak salad had a great chimichurri sauce and a great Gorgonzola vinaigrette .  The steak was cooked perfectly !   Definitely check out this place - the food is great !"}
{"text":"The food is so good and Unique!  The breakfast bowls are healthy and very tasty.  The service is A+ and very friendly.  This is not your average breakfast place the bar is awesome too!  Wish they had more places like this around!!"}
{"text":"So we went on the recommendation of a friend who raved about BKB.  We were at lunch at another restaurant (we eat out way too much) and she whipped out the menu.  I was instantly drawn to the Churro Waffle and had to give it a go.  The wait was long, worth it?  Only if I have to have a Churro Waffle again.  The Churro Waffle had a scoop of ice cream on top and the waffle itself was very, very, good.  Ice Cream and Waffles for Breakfast, yes please!  The omelettes are open faced, husband had a create your own and is was decent but did I tell you about the Churro Waffles yet???  Oh yeah, they are bombdiggity bam, boom!  I know, I am a bit geeky at times but hey, why not show my true colors when talking about CHURRO WAFFLES?!!!  This restaurant is busy, crowded, and service is a bit rushed during brunch hours as expected. I might check out their lunch menu if ever in the quarter on a weekday."}
{"text":"We had a really excellent brunch here today.  All the dishes were prepared well, very fresh ingredients and served at correct temperatures. The ambience was good too--music not too loud and we were able to converse easily.  Our waitress Nancy was very nice and attentive too.   This restaurant is definitely in my rotation for \"go to\" restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place had a pretty long wait but it definitely helped to hang out by the bar and get a glass of champagne with sorbet and frozen strawberries.  For actual breakfast, I shared a Churro waffle which was very crispy and delicious. I also had an Eggs Benedict with brisket over a cauliflower patty instead of the English muffin....it was so yummy!"}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G.  Loved this great place to eat and relax.  The outdoor patio is lovely.  Great latte. My breakfast was the Spanish Frittata a an order of the buttermilk pancakes with the homemade blueberry syrup. Divine.  The wait for this place to open at the Scottsdale Quarter was well worth the wait. **portions are large so sharing is a good!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first week of its grand opening. They didn't really have their routine quite down, so food took a while...but the salad was huge and fresh. By the next month I was a little dissapointed that their routine was still not down, not even on the to go side.  However....their food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"There are a plethora of items on the menu at Breakfast Kitchen Bar. Whether you crave a breakfast bowl, smoothie, Benedict, waffles, or an omelet, there are multiple options and varying degrees of healthiness you can choose from.   We stepped in on a mild mid morning to have some brunch. I ordered the farmer's omelet sans cheese with roasted potatoes. The omelet was gigantic, filled with fluffy eggs, zucchini, mushrooms, artichoke, spinach, green onions and tomato, just to name a few! The eggs were nice and fluffy and the filling plentiful. The roasted potatoes were nicely cooked but were a bit too salty for me; overall I enjoyed them though. My meal also came with a side of fresh berries which was a refreshing cold and sweet contrast to all the savory hot food.  Service was friendly and sweet.   The waffles and pancakes from here looked amazing so I will have to try that next time.  This is definitely a great spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I'm confused by the 4 and 5 star reviews. Here is an honest review: First off it was very crowded inside, perhaps due to poor table arrangement. It seemed over the maximum occupancy. It was very  loud so if you are looking for a relaxing Sunday afternoon brunch this is not your place. The wait time for seating was reasonable however the wait time for our food was not. Our plates were hot but the food was cold. I would have complained to the waitress but we didn't see her again until she brought the check. The food quality was fair at best. On a positive note the portions were large. A better option for breakfast/brunch in Scottsdale would be either Butters or First Watch."}
{"text":"Such a great addition to the Scottsdale quarter shopping center. I have come here a few times and every time it is so delicious. Finally a place that knows how to make a great salad! It's hard to go wrong here and everything is fresh and delicious - will totally be back."}
{"text":"Went with my good friend for brunch this morning. Very busy!! Free coffee while you wait, but we were taken in and attended to pretty quickly given the number of people being served. I ordered the protein plate with salmon, egg whites, avocado, zucchini, and cauliflower mash, and my friend ordered the chicken with eggs, broccoli, asparagus and avocado. They give you a large-sized portion!  She didn't care for the chicken or asparagus, said the latter was soggy. I enjoyed my plate but it's pretty bland. Really great if you're looking to eat super clean though. Favorite part was the cauliflower mash- the flavor depth is impressive. $14 for salmon plus $2 upgrade for egg whites. Expensive for a brunch at $20 without alcohol. There are better priced options though for sure. There was a breakfast burrito that looked awesome! And they had lots of unhealthy choices I'd love to try if I wasn't attempting to be healthy. Nice patio and outdoor eating experience. Will likely go back!"}
{"text":"We had a girls breakfast today and sat outside and had a fabulous breakfast. The service is amazing and so is the food. So many healthy options. We love BKB!"}
{"text":"Good food and pet friendly. We sat on the patio and the service was slow with a long wait for food. But they were very busy. Staff was friendly and working hard. Maybe a few more people on staff would help. We had breakfast and the amazing avocado fries. Wow. Overall great."}
{"text":"Fabulous!!! Gorgeous setting, lovely patio that is both elegant and comfortable. Terrific Benedict eggs. The only challenge is it's too perfect!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today around noon. It was full, both inside and outside. We gave our name, and only waited approximately 15 minutes. Our server came immediately and took our beverage order. She brought our coffees and said she would back to take our orders. This was our first time here. The menu had a large variety of things to choose from. My husband and I both chose breakfast items. It was not long after we ordered, that our food was served. Both items, were delicious. I will definitely go back again, this time for some lunch."}
{"text":"Second time here and loving it more and more!   The patio on the street is very relaxed, and feels like you're in a big city surrounded by buildings watching the people rush by.  Food is excellent. Ordered an omelette and it came out exactly how I wanted it (customized). It's a little different because the omelette was cooked in a frittata fashion, opened up with toppings on top like a pizza! The hash brown cake was fantastic as well.  Will surely return, possibly have a mimosa next visit :)   5/5"}
{"text":"Best salad I've ever had. Customer service was great. Employees were very attentive and friendly. Food came out quickly and tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast/brunch spot in all of AZ, I mean there is nothing ordinary about their menu, everything is so unique and amazing, delicious with plenty of options to satisfy anyone and everyone's cravings !!! Went there with my girlfriends, I had the egg white wrap, aaaamazing but the protein pancakes were the highlight, never tasted anything healthy tasting that good, they were perfect, my other friend had the spinach egg Benedict, that was awesome as well, highly recommend, not cheap but well worth it, will be back. Not sure why people are holding back on giving them 5 star reviews, this place rocks and waiters were very nice, it did take some time to get the food, but I'm sure it would take you much longer to make these things from scratch at home, this isn't your sunny side up breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"A group of 4 went last Saturday at 12:30pm and it was packed. After waiting for about 40 min. we finally got seated. Everything on their menu looked delicious so we ordered a few different dishes to share.  Breakfast pizza: ours looked nothing like the photos we saw on Yelp. It was tasty but definitely missing some kind of sauce. I doused my portion in hot sauce and that seemed to do the trick.   Breakfast quesadilla: this was my favorite dish. The portion was huge, we still had some leftover despite splitting it. Think cheese quesadilla with tons of quac, cheese, salsa, beans, and grilled onions on it. This is a great dish to share.  Almond croissant french toast: ok, I love almond croissants and was pretty disappointed by this dish. It was tasty but didn't have the delicious almond mixture/taste found in regular almond croissants. My portion was just enough, I'm glad I didn't order this for myself, it would have been too sweet.  Service: our waitress was great, she kept us updated and made sure we were good on drinks. However, the food took over an hour. It was 3pm by the time we left. I'm not sure if this is common since other reviews don't really mention this so maybe the kitchen was understaffed. We also found it funny that the avocado toast was the last thing to come out...   I would definitely come back to give them another try and to try the churro waffle out. Hoping they can work the kinks out. It's definitely a great addition to Scottsdale Quarter!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this was possibly the best breakfast spot I have ever been to. You don't get your standard \"pancakes and omelettes\" fare here. You get avocado toast, breakfast bowls, and nutella smothered waffles with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Oh yes. I had the cauliflower mash breakfast bowl, and it was warm and creamy and heavenly. I ate half of it and saved the other half for breakfast the next day and it was absolutely perfect. The server was delightful, and the coffee was flowing. I left feeling so full and happy; I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! My husband ordered the burrito (AMAZING) and I ordered the Blueberry French Toast, which was delicious. As I looked around at what other people ordered, I realized so many different dishes looked tasty. I saw someone with the Almond Croissant and someone else with the protein pancakes...I hope to try both of those dishes at some point. We also happened to be seated next to the owners of the restaurant who were there eating. They were kind and friendly. Knowing that he restaurant has nice owners is definitely an added bonus."}
{"text":"Perfect brunch place for a weekend.  I loved the open floor plan of this place, it's very airy and bright. The offerings for various palettes was very diverse and intriguing. Protein lovers, vegans, normal eaters, etc, come one, come all, there is something for EVERYONE here.  I got the burrito bowl and hubs got an omelette. Both were fantastic. Portion sizes are pretty large, so be prepared. We were so stuffed, we ended up taking home leftovers.   I got the Bloody Mary and hubs got a raspberry mimosa. Both which were delicious! Check this place out. Just don't get lost like we did, trying to find the place! Haha"}
{"text":"My meal was delicious! Great atmosphere and excellent service. We went for breakfast/ brunch, 10am. There was a 30 min wait, however we were a party of 8. Service was great but the meal was phenomenal. I had the breakfast nachos. I was skeptical at first but was completely blown away. I would definitely recommend anyone to who like fries with their breakfast."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday around 12:30, table for 2. Had to wait less than 15 minutes. Waters dropped promply, friendly server, Mellissa. Gave us a minute to cruise the somewhat diverse munu. Ordered and had food in front of us in 10 minutes. Breakfast burrito and blueberry French toast. Burrito was good sized and very yummy. Had chorizo and bacon, potato and egg. French toast was not to my flavor. Ate a couple bites and that was more than enough. Dry and had some sort of Orange (?) flavor cream sauce. Rasberry jam in between the two slices.  This place was pretty packed and you should be forewarned, that if you are slightly hard of hearing due to tinatus, or have a hearing aid, you won't be able to carry on or be a part of the conversation, as this place is above average LOUD.  Has outdoor seating and misters for when it's hot."}
{"text":"Hard pass!  What a bummer too because our waitress was darling and very informative. We were seating and our waitress was at our table within minutes, explained the concept of the restaurant etc.  We ordered our breakfast, nothing crazy by any means, and waited 30 minutes...again no biggie until we got our order.  I ordered eggs benie with a poached egg hard when I cut in runny.  I asked if I sent it back how long would it take she said 10 minutes.  In the meantime people were seated, ate, got to go boxes, etc.  after 20 mins I asked to go ahead cxl the order and be sure to tell your manager.  5 mins later we got our bill and my order and shocker still runny eggs.  Never were we approached by a manager but our server, who again was lovely, apologized profusely.  There are WAY too many choices in Kierland and Scottsdale Quarters to have such a shitty experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch, love checking out new places. We will NEVER be back. The food was fairly tasty, that wasn't the problem. Fairly busy during time we were there and our server was very pleasant and seemed to be handling herself quite well. The problem was with the man whom I later found out was the owner. There appeared to be an issue with the bill at another table. Long story short, the owner berated our server in the middle of the restaurant in front of  customers and other tables. After hearing other employees discuss that this was fairly typical behavior for him, we decided right then and there that this would be our last visit. I felt terrible for the waitress, but she didn't seem to allow it to affect her job. That isn't how you treat your employees, and if it is, I hope they find somewhere else to work. Next time, we will take our friends to Hash Kitchen or Snooze."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great people only down side it's extremely popular but they have no waiting area. Standing outside in Arizona sun not an option. People crowded by door trying to stay out of sun, this blocks the flow of the wait staff. Considering the shopping center they are in no way to fix this problem."}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast food in Scottsdale, and great drinks as well. They have very unique items, like their breakfast quesadilla, and shrimp scampi omelette. The food is amazing! The service is pretty good too. Be mindful of when you go, because the place can get packed pretty fast. But if you pick a time when things are slower, it's really enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food quality is next to none. It is loud inside but still, the atmosphere is fantastic. Came on a Saturday morning and there wasn't a wait. The waiters are tentative and helpful."}
{"text":"It's probably a good thing that we don't live anywhere near because this is a diet buster for me.  We got the breackfast nachos off the seasonal menu, and a burrito bowl.  Then as our real splurge we got the churro waffle.  In hindsight, we should have split the nachos as I barely ate half. We can't wait to go back and bring some friends so we can try even more of their yummy menu."}
{"text":"Recently I went to Breakfast Kitchen Bar and I had a mediocre experience. It was my first time and the menu looked great but I was disappointed with how little gluten free options they had. And I know that it's hard to cater towards gluten free but even the hash browns had bread crumbs in it which is cheap due to the fact that hash browns don't need bread crumbs. Also my friend ordered the hash brown bowl and it looked poorly made. It was small and the dish looked like something I could make at home. I was pleasantly surprised with my dish though which was the yogurt parfait. What I was really disappointed in was the service. My friends and I say outside and there was us and two other tables so it wasn't busy outside. We had to have two waitresses, I asked for ice coffee three times and they gave me hot coffee, and our first waitress said she was so busy even though she was literally putting salt shakers on the table. They have us attitude and was kind of rude and I'm thinking it's because we were all teens. I have it a three store because although I wasn't pleased with my visit, I hear it's a great place to go and the menu had really good variety of foods."}
{"text":"THEE best avocado toast I've ever had!  Called in a to go order, they had my order ready right on time with utensils and napkins ready to go!   Ready to go back and try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Outside seating is really lovely. Staff is friendly. The food described as healthy... not so much.  But if you want an amazing waffle experience look no further. They've got it down to a science!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating at this place...until I did. I will start by saying that I am giving them 2 stars because my cappuccino was good and my sandwich, although not received the way I ordered, was still good. When we arrived the server was relatively friendly. We placed our order a few minutes later and come 35 minutes later we still did not have our food. The server notified us at this point that they messed up my sandwich so they had to remake it. 15 minutes later our server came back and said that my sandwich was ready but my husbands steak had to be remade because they accidentally gave it to someone who had a to go order. Now I'm thinking...really? Ten minutes after that we received our order. My sandwich did not have the chicken I ordered on it and my husbands steak was not cooked correctly. At this point we were so hungry we started eating. When I was finally able to flag down our server I showed her there was no chicken on the sandwich and she said I'll make sure I take off the upcharge for it. Unfortunately I will never return to this place. It is one thing to wait over 45 minutes to receive food but another to not have a manager come over and say sorry and try to make things right. Our server didn't try to rectify the situation either. We were still charged full price and no discounts or gratis offered. It's pretty sad that several excuses were made for why our food took so long and nothing was done about it."}
{"text":"Was just ok . Nothing to come back for.  The buss guy was awesome ! Better then the waitress that was too busy looking in the mirror then to ask how the meal was.  Food was good ... but again... waitress never asked if everything was good."}
{"text":"Completely & totally impressed. The amosphere is casual & inviting. The menu is perfect with options for everyone - from waffles & chocolate chip pancakes to quinoa bowls and omlets on the healthier side. Excellent vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"This new addition to the Scottsdale Quarter is both refreshing and familiar. As a native east coaster who has spent a lot of time traveling - and who also loves the west coast lifestyle - BKB feels both at-home and interesting at the same time.  The decor is top notch. Simply complex, elegantly industrial, and familiarly extraordinary. The food is equally complex, yet simply delicious. I have yet to have a bad meal here...and I've had several. Breakfast is wide-ranging and interesting, yet doesn't depart so far from the norm that one cannot find comfort food elements within nearly every dish. Brunch options are equally fascinating, yet accessible. And a full-service bar - complete with citrus juicer - offers everything from mimosas to mules. The eggs benedict options are particularly tasty and somewhat creative. For those on gluten-free/sensitive diets, substitute the cauliflower cakes (these are outstanding) for the english muffin.  The staff, like the restaurant, are new. There are definitely some hiccups in service as this newbie comes into its own. Management seems to be attentive to these needs and accommodates any missteps with complimentary offerings. Paige behind the bar is a genuine rockstar. If you happen to be there when she's working, you'll be in very good hands. (Just don't knock Wisconsin too hard, or she might be ready to rumble!)  BKB has quickly become a favorite spot in this neck of the woods and should be for a long time to come."}
{"text":"So this actually happened. My friend and I were shopping at the Quarter and decided to stop in for brunch. There was a half hour wait but there were two seats together at the bar and a single seat on the other side of the bar. We asked the hostess whether the two seats were available because a guy, who appeared to be an employee, seemed to be sitting in one of the seats when he wasn't working on a terminal close by. The hostess spoke to him briefly and then came back and told us that we couldn't have the two seats because her \"manager\" was using one of them. I looked at her incredulously and asked why he wouldn't move to the single seat so we could sit down. She shook her head apologetically and asked if we wanted to put our name in for a table. We said \"Uh, no thank you.\" and left.   In the end I was grateful. BKB may or may not survive given its unique approach to the art of hospitality, but I'll be telling this amazing story forever."}
{"text":"I live in Chicago and have been working in Scottsdale for several months. I've been to this restaurant four times now, including this morning. I keep hoping because they have a great menu. The problem is the food is always Luke warn on its best day. I sent my food back the first three times. Today was the same, cold to luke warm. I didn't bother sending it back, I paid and left. Never to return. I'm a chef and in watching the kitchen I have reasons to think nothing will change. Hash browns that were cold every time are pre made and held in a pan under a light. Not a heat lamp, a white light. The expo handles the hash browns and other items without sanitary gloves. Just not a good operation. Menu looks great and could be. But until their practices change, go to the Waffle House. Their food is at least hot."}
{"text":"Talk about service nightmare and you can experience here with the rude server. As if they are doing a favor by taking your money and serving cold sandwiches an hour after you ordered.   We came at 12 and seated right away. Ordered food but the food came 45 mins later.the sandwich was cold tasteless and bland.   We tell the server the sandwich is cold, she won't even let us finish one sentence and says ok I will get the manager so rudely. Wow! Go and screw yourself guys.   Manager didn't seem to care. He offered to replace with a diff dish but the main issue about the service? He doesn't even wanna acknowledge until pressed on it.   Not worth the wait. Average bland  food. Confusing menu. Stupid servers. Uncertain wait times.  There are better options than rude service."}
{"text":"We got here a bit before 11, restaurant was about 1/2 full. Requested to sit outside as the misters are incredible and the patio set up is equally incredible because it's mostly shaded. However we were seated inside. Server was extremely friendly but was noticeably busy as both our drinks and food were taking an abnormally amount of time to come out. We ordered the raspberry lemon drop. It was tasty but was more mojito adjacent with the amount of muddled fruit that was inside, the sugared rim was messy but delicious. For entrees we ordered the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, Blueberry French Toast and the Breakfast Burrito. All of which were amazing. Plates were cleared away quickly and efficiently but it took some time to get cashed out. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and we are sure to return!"}
{"text":"Outsdanig choices of food. We enjoyed their breakfast. We loved the fast and effective services.  Kèep it up. On 5/21/17 we came back again. Total dissatisfaction. We wanted to have maple syrup with our waffle,  their answer is fine but they charge additional $$$. We ask for another tea bag, they will charge additional $$$ for tea bag. This not the way you run your business.  Never Again"}
{"text":"Went early for breakfast Sunday morning and was happy to get in right away.  I expected a long line, since it's a new place, but going early really helped.  They have a really interesting menu.  Some unusual combinations and items that are a welcome change from the regular breakfast joints.  The place is nice, tho nothing fabulous looking.  It is not very big.  Parking of course will not be great, as Scottsdale Quarter is always packed.  Anyway, we ordered breakfast and it came in a reasonable time frame.  Unfortunately, everything was cold.  The moment I saw the potatoes, I knew they would be terrible, and they were.  They offer roast potatoes or hash browns, and since I don't like hash browns I ordered the roast ones, with hesitation, I might add.  They were cold, limp, tasteless, barely golden potatoes.  No seasoning, no onions, peppers, nothing.  Bland, bland, bland.  My omelet was way overcooked.  It had brown, burnt, crisp edges and brown throughout.  My water glass had paper in the bottom of it.  My daughter had the churro waffle with nutella and it was good she said, but cold.  We ordered a glass of cold milk and it came in a coffee cup.  Very weird.  Probably trying to look like a cafe au lait, but it didn't work.  The service was very amateur.  We had to ask for silverware and napkins, even after she brought the food.  Could she not see we had nothing to eat with?  We had to wait for a while for a manager to adjust the bill.  Even he was nowhere in sight.  If you claim to be a breakfast place, but can't make a light and fluffy omelette, and can't deliver hot food, what good are you?"}
{"text":"A breakfast spot to add to our list. Service was attentive, food came out hot, we were warned that it's cooked to order so adjusted our expectations. I had the chilaquiles with green chile pork and requested a side of sauce, as the chips were dry. I would prefer 1) the traditional green sauce and 2) more heat. Hub had a Belgian waffle and was very satisfied with the crispy exterior/ tender interior. I think you could just do a traditional waffle and bypass the extra toppings. The bananas foster seemed like too much of a good thing.   All in all, a good spot to add to the breakfast rounds."}
{"text":"Friday about 10am, sat outside for brunch with 3 others.  Not busy at all yet we waited quite a lot for food and drinks.  Plates were brought out at different times and some were not hot.  Not generous portions.  Overpriced and run of the mill.  Not special."}
{"text":"Ate here twice.  Both times service was terrible!  Both occasions ordered my meal without bacon but it came with.  Today we waited 1 hour for our table, when we were told 20 minutes.  Other people were accidentally getting seated before us, we thought mistakes happen and moved on.  Ordered our food, got my coffee with lipstick on the mug.  Asked her for a new cup, didn't get it for 30 minutes. My husbands food was cold, my sons meal came 45 minutes after the rest of us finished our meal. Several people came by apologizing but still nothing was being done about my sons food being delivered.  Each time someone would come to our table and realize that we have not received my sons order and we continued to wait and wait.    Our afternoon was wasted at this restaurant, horrible experience, our bill was taken care of.  I understand that it's a new restaurant but I hope they get it together."}
{"text":"My Blueberry French Toast was delicious, employees where all very sweet and friendly. Only downside food takes forever to come out and so does the check when your done and I'm a patient person but truthfully I lost my patience waiting so long and I'm not the first person to. As big as there staff is it shouldn't take so long. Great place for breakfast/lunch so many yummy options I will definitely be going back for more ! :)"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service at the bar .... horrible.  I came in on a lunch break and the lady asked be what I'd like to order without handing me a menu, she then replied ( not in a rude voice but the statement was rude) that next time i can grab a menu next to the register..... i was confused because i thought that was her job !"}
{"text":"After eating here many times, we no longer will be. Unfortunately, the restaurant has its act together in many ways, except for 'seating'. Very young hostesses randomly give tables away and it does not matter where/when you checked in. After waiting outside in the heat to see your table given away in mistake, without an apology, is enough for me. Too many other choice restaurants to go to here. Bye bye."}
{"text":"A good breakfast place with a convenient location and nice atmosphere. Shrimp Scampi Omelet was a bit underwhelming and the egg was quite puffy and overwhelming (wonder if they add gluten/pancake mix to them as some establishments do). Portabello Spinach Benedict was tasty, though the English muffin a bit too dense for my taste. Liked the fresh appeal to both meals. Service was great."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The atmosphere is great, and the food is amazing.  I had the farmer's market omelet.  Hands down, the best omelet I've ever had.  The berry mimosa was also fantastic.  It was just a really nice place to go for a casual brunch.  We must have been pretty lucky, or maybe just early, but the wait was not bad at all.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while walking in the Scottsdale Quarter one morning while on vacation.  We absolutely loved the Farmer's market omelet and avocado fries, they were both AMAZING!!!!  We loved it so much we came back 3 other mornings of our vacation.  You can eat outside or in, we ate outside when the weather was nice, and one day inside because it was cold and windy when we were there (March).  You must try this omelet and the avocado fries.  Now we are back in IL and dying for those fries!!  Oh, and all the waitresses were super nice!"}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious! This place has a menu of champs. So many amazing options and all 100% delicious. I originally came here because they are the only place I found that has a CHURRO WAFFLE. If you want dessert for brunch, that's the go-to. From their meats to their produce, everything tastes fresh and perfectly selected. Definitely great spot for a brunch date!"}
{"text":"I work in the Quarter and walk by it all the time, but I haven't had the chance to check out BKB until this last week. My friend and I met up bright and early at 7:15. There were only two other parties dining so I can't say much for BKB's service and ambiance during busy hours, but while we were there, both were fantastic.   Pros: OMG the food. I was not expecting their menu to be so large and diverse. I got an avocado bowl of some sort and it was amazing, though towards the end I felt like maybe it was too avocado-heavy? I didn't ever believe there could be such a thing, and it was so subtle I don't think I wouldn't order it again. From what I can tell, she loved her food as well. One day, I will come back for the churro waffle.   Cons: For the most part, everything was cool. But I wasn't blown away. I think this is a great option if you need a brunch place in N Scottsdale, but I don't know that I would seek BKB over other options if I had the time to venture around the city to some of the true gems our town has to offer. The atmosphere is pleasant, but I detected a diner undertone in the basic concept of their menu and design. I'm sure that's great for many people, but my expectation for a SQ brunch place was a little higher."}
{"text":"So, I walk into breakfast kitchen bar this morning to have brunch with my two friends we all decided to have mimosas and are all over 21 years of age. They asked us for our ID's TWICE because they were so incompetent and thought we weren't old enough. FINALLY-- They bring out our mimosas after literally 45 minutes and there's a FRUIT FLY crawling around on the raspberry they put in my mimosa. Horribly disgusting. SAM, the manager, told me if I said anything he would \"kick me out\". My drink wasn't comped and I will never be back. So gross and very rude to treat a customer like that after you serve them a tainted drink."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here, really nice outdoor seating. It was chilly the day that we went and they had the heaters on outside which was really nice and cozy! My friend and I ordered the farmers omelet and the blueberry French toast. The omelet was a little burned but the flavors were good and the potatoes that came with it were made really well. Wasn't a fan of the blueberry French toast as I felt like there was way too much blueberry and didn't really like the texture of the bread, but that could just be a personal preference! But I will definitely be back to try something else"}
{"text":"I work in the Scottsdale Quarter and this is my restaurant of choice.  Their menu is ever changing and seems to get better and better.  I typically order their avocado toast with poached eggs or any of their Benedicts. When I do change it up I am never disappointed.  Plus I always take visiting friends and associates because I know they will be pleased.  The food is fresh and delicious, the service is stellar and the portions are very generous - usually enough for two lunches.  Their coffee drinks are excellent - no bitter espresso!  It may be a hassle visiting the Quarter with parking, etc., but this restaurant is totally worth it for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Saw this just opened...random yelping  We came in, got seated immediately  Wait time was fast. We got in and got out  Beautiful atmosphere, awesome setup, & loving the smell.... Food was amazing! Service was great as well I had the blueberry French toast, significant other had the hash brown breakfast pizza  Definitely will be coming back 5+"}
{"text":"What a wonderful breakfast! The food was good and service was outstanding - the best combo to start your day! At the recommendation of my server Brenna, I changed from my original choice to the Breakfast Nachos. With a couple of fried eggs and some green chili pulled pork, I had a great meal. The coffee was great and Brenna was very attentive.  I can't wait to come back and try another recommendation from Brenna!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast today & I'm already planning my next trip back! Cute patio area with misters, decent size indoor space as well. My first thoughts - the menu is extensive! But in a good way. There are so many good options offered, and they have PLENTY of healthy options including gluten free & keto friendly.   I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict bowl (hollandaise on the side) and a protein pancake with sugar free syrup. The bowl had cauliflower broccoli cakes instead of the traditional English muffin and they were so good! Super savory and topped with a yummy pesto. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the lox style salmon was presented very well, I would definitely order again. The pancake was ok, not my favorite texture and lacked some flavor I probably won't order again. The syrup was good and I love that they offer sugar free items.   Service was good, food came out in a timely manner. Overall I really enjoyed my breakfast! Good portion sizes, you definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Had brunch there this past Sunday and it was amazing!! Already planning my next visit for this weekend with friends. Tried the grilled cheese bacon French toast and it was out of this world amazing! The entire menu is completely affordable. The restaurant it super cool and hip music playing. I LOVE the patio section outside. Great interior. The only negative thing I experienced was it took quite some time for our food to come out and it was later in the morning... afternoonish and there weren't many people inside but they are a new restaurant so I'm sure they are still working out the kinks in the kitchen. Other than that it was awesome! Already recommending to friends and coworkers! Can't wait to try other menu items!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could seriously try their food! Our food took almost 45 mins. Our server who was a blonde chick with heavy ass makeup had the worst attitude of all time. I simply asked a question \"do you know how long our food is gonna take? I feel like it's been 45 mins?\" And she literally blew up on me saying it's not my fault it's the kitchen's fault. I don't work in the kitchen! And literally got so mad to where I was like wtf just happened? Why is she freaking out? Horrible horrible service. Control your anger darling and your makeup too."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese bacon french toast is a must-try!!!Fast and friendly service, nice  interiors, good ambiance and the price is just right. They use unique names on their menu and did some twist on the traditional breakfast which is really brilliant and awesome (the coffee i ordered is called OCD~) plus it really taste good. I'll surely be back if i visit AZ again. :)"}
{"text":"Heaven!  Waffles and mocha! Busy but worth the wait. Noisy inside but the patio is perfect.  Restrooms could use a little attention."}
{"text":"I visited the BKB October 17, 2017 for the first time. I'm always looking to try new breakfast restaurants around Scottsdale and discovered this little gem! I thought the menu had a number of unique breakfast offerings and since I couldn't make up my mind, decided on my old standby, the basic eggs Benedict. I'm pretty fussy when it comes to hollandaise sauce and this one was great. This truly was one of the best Benedict's I've ever had! A thick piece of ham that had some crisp to it, sautéed spinach and the eggs cooked perfectly. Top it with that great hollandaise and it was a meal made in heaven. My friend ordered the same thing and he agreed it was fabulous as well. Wade was a great server and very attentive and friendly. If this is any indication of what to expect with other entree's, I'm well on my way to having this as my new fave breakfast spot! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast place in the valley! It is super comfortable and our waitress was the best waitress ever! She was so friendly and made my friends and I feel so comfortable. When we asked questions about the menu, she knew what she was talking about. I love the vibes and it's so cozy and cute. The food was incredible! 10/10. My friends and I love this place so much. definitely recommend this place:)"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were great. I had the breakfast burrito and it is huge and very filling. Service was good but the food took a little longer than anticipated. Orange juice is very good, but be prepared to pay $5 for a glass. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I originally visited this place when the wait at Snooze (a short walk way) was an hour long. That being said, I have really come to enjoy the food here. I've had a benedict, the breakfast burrito, and the blueberry french toast- all of which were great. The blueberry french toast is the best I've ever had. As a side note, the coffee cups at this restaurant are huge."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast/lunch spot. Service is fantastic, and food is always on point. Fried Chicken Steak Sandwhich!!! Go get one, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and design.  Strong menu, extremely reasonable prices, and attentive staff.  Quinoa fiesta bowl was enormous.  Lots of competition in this space, but an absolute definite return spot."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first and last time today. I've had food poisoning all day after eating here.   The only reason I will rate 1 star is because of the location, cleanliness and decor.   The coffee was $3 and wasn't good. Had a burnt taste and wasn't very hot. Only got refilled once and I had to ask for it.  I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was ridiculous. It was massive, smothered and it wasn't hot. It also, was just okay at about $11. The waitress asked me what kind of potatoes I wanted with my order and didn't warn that it was an extra charge, so I thought they came with the order. They were $2. The group I was with liked some things and didn't like others.   Basically, it just seems like another trendy breakfast spot. It's over priced and the service is lacking."}
{"text":"I'd like to begin by saying the food was wonderful and our server Brittany/Britney (sp?) was FANTASTIC...however, I was so disappointed by the hostess, Destiny, who seemingly at first came off as very sweet to me. We had been quoted a wait time of 35 mins and requested an outside table, and it seemed like I got a bad vibe from her...I am a kind of forward/dry person so I just assumed it was due to my intensity (though I am never rude even on an off day which this was not)...at around 30 mins a table was available, but I knew there was a group in front of us for it who had been right in front of me when I originally put my name in. No one sat the table for a good ten minutes so I casually went up to double check because I thought they may not have seen it. She reminded me that there was ONE group in front of me...eventually they did seat that table and it was a separate group before us, which is fine. The other group I had seen decided to sit inside. At around 45 mins another table became available, so after she had told me we would be the next group, we waited again for someone to seat the table, which sat there and sat there open. I approached her again to be told ANOTHER group was in front of us. Eventually I watched her seat a group I KNOW had come in later and we had decided to take a table from inside, which she offered to us and was a horrible location right next to the kitchen entry and back up to the bar. I saw ANOTHER table open up outside so I kindly asked our waitress right after we were seated if we could move, she asked Destiny and again was told there was a group in front of us. It seemed these groups were just coming out of no where...At this point we decided forget it and ordered our food, 15 mins later having her come offer an outside table. No thanks...for awhile I thought I was going crazy to think she had some personal vendetta against me but my friend offered that she definitely was intentionally acting out. It was extremely rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I had the grilled cheese bacon French toast  and raspberry mimosas! To die for!"}
{"text":"I've been to Breakfast Kitchen Bar three times - one for takeout and twice dining in the restaurant.   The food has been really great, but the service leaves a little to be desired.  I went in with four co-workers for lunch this week.  We got a seat right away because they weren't busy but it took quite awhile for anybody to ever take a drink order.  Our food took forever to arrive and came out in shifts with an eight minute gap between the first person's order coming out and the last person's order coming out.  I actually had to ask for a to go container because after waiting 30 minutes for food, I had to leave for a meeting at work.  I wouldn't recommend this place if you only have an hour for lunch because you'll probably be rushed through your meal or you'll have to get it to go.   On the food side - everything has been great.  My favorite is the Spinach Quinoa Chicken Salad.  It's got a lot of great grilled chicken, avocado, tomatoes and quinoa - quite delicious and very filling.  My co-workers got the Avocado Toast  and Eggs Benedict which were both hits.    Great food - just need to figure out how to speed up the kitchen and the service."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito bowl is amazing.  I got it without bacon and it was a lot of food, perfect amount of food and spice.  I highly suggest it and get the protein bar as dessert."}
{"text":"BKB does everything right! I have been here with? family, forends, and alone. Each time, I have enjoyed my experience. Lisa, behind the bar, is always friendly and makes a mean Dirty Chai with almond milk. I love the potato wedges and unique breakfast creations. Honestly, this place has the best coffee in the Quarter, even better than Press! I look forward to more meals at BKB."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful, caring servers awaits you here. Indoor and outdoor seating. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I had the I Am Sandwhich with chorizo which was phenomenal. Fun atmosphere and the top drink we had was the orange liqueur flavored drink. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Breakfast kitchen bar was a very pleasant surprise for me and I honestly wish I gave it a try earlier.  Went in early on a quiet Tuesday morning (Halloween to be exact). Place was nice and quiet. Expected for a weekday early breakfast. Service was prompt and coffee was hot. Already off to a great start.  I judged a book by its cover and figured it would be small portions with high price tags (I'm also a hard sell on breakfast out, as I make a mean omelette myself for a much smaller price point). But to my surprise BKB exceeding my expectations big time. Portions were HUGE. And everything was ordered was beyond fabulous.  I will be back!!  Pictured is the breakfast burro. I took half of it home and turned it Into two more meals it was that big and that stuffed with deliciousness.  Also the churro waffle. A must try. We shared it as a side. My fav part was how crispy and sweet it was.   My brother got the almond croissant, which lasted about 2 seconds on his plate. So alas, no pic. But he boasted how good it was and he made the best choice at the table."}
{"text":"It got so busy that it was going to be a 20 min wait for a table but we were able to snag seats at the bar. Full service at the bar and the girls there helped us choose our drinks and entrees. Their mimosas and white sangrias are a definite try. And of course thien most popular item.. the churro waffle. I left perfectly happy and full!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this new and hip breakfast spot in Scottsdale.  Ingredients were quality, and good coffee and tea.  Server was really personable.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Monday morning at 9 a.m.  Was not crowded at all; maybe 5 tables were taken.  Cute place, hostess friendly.  Waiter seemed nervous and new.  My guest asked for a coffee with steamed milk/latte but was brought coffee with a side of steamed milk.  Coffee cups are enormous!  Waiter had to be reminded to refill coffee.  Food was uninspired and the order came wrong for both of us.  We both also asked for sides of fruit and named specific fruits to avoid. A food runner brought our order and when we told him we ordered strawberries/blueberries/bananas only, he replied: \"Oh, well this is how the fruit cup comes,\" and left it at that.  No apology, no offer to make it right.  Waiter never asked, \"how did everything come out?\"  The fruit cups were clearly not fresh; bananas were already brown.  Two entrees and coffees came to $33.  I probably won't come back and will continue to enjoy Snooze and First Watch."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I've come here three times trying so hard to wipe the slate clean and treat each time as a fresh experience and hope for the best. I love the concept, I like the space, I enjoy the open feel of sitting outside or having the open door feel. I do not like having orders come from the kitchen at different times for each guest (making it hard to really share a meal together) or food will come out at the same time but at least one person's food is cold, missing a key ingredient, or mixed up with someone else's order. I know that BKB is a busy place. I know that they are a made-to-order kitchen. I just want consistency across visits so that I can rely on my meal being served correctly the first time.   **Note: the wait staff and kitchen staff are very accommodating and very apologetic if any mishap has occured. Which I appreciate, and which is the reason for why I reserved my review until after my third visit (hoping it was just early days or figuring out the timing of each new dish). I have hope that the kitchen and staff will work out a rhythm and my 4th visit will make me love this place as much as I want to.**"}
{"text":"Found this place waiting around for my Apple store appointment. Protein pancakes are bombdiggity here!! Don't even need to ruin them with syrup and the ricotta cream was a yummy twist. Everyone else's plates also look delicious. Service is great, promptness and smiles from entire staff. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my new, favorite breakfast/lunch spot. I rarely travel to dine outside my neighborhood since we have so many options.  Prior to taking a shopping trip with my son to Scottsdale Quarter, I decided to take a look at the dining options and found this gem. After looking at the photos and menu, we decided to give it a try.  Wow! We were pleasantly surprised. Since it was around lunch time a few days after Christmas, they were quite busy. It was a perfect day to enjoy their small outside area that is surrounded by an unobtrusive railing and includes outdoor heaters for chilly mornings, and we were quickly seated there by a very friendly young man.  Our waitress arrived quickly to take our drink order and clarify any questions we had about the menu. She remained attentive throughout the time we were there despite the fast-paced rush.  My son selected the blueberry french toast, and I chose a classic benedict bowl from their beta menu. When seated and while ordering, we were told they were a scratch kitchen, and everything is made daily in house including the hollandaise sauce. I am 55 and have been in love with eggs benedict and hollandaise sauce since I was a child. Theirs is absolutely the best I've ever had. I managed to eat way more of the large portion than I thought I could because I didn't want to stop.  I also ordered a bloody mary and was delighted with my drink as well. Just the right amount of spice, and the rim of the glass was dipped in candied bacon bits (yum).  Prices were very reasonable (two entrees and drinks [my son had tea] for right around $40) considering the location, portion size, and quality.  I can't wait to go back and look forward to bringing friends and family from out of town when they visit."}
{"text":"Unlike other locations in the area, this place welcomed us the second we walked in the door. We were seated right away. Decor is very warm and cozy. As packed as they are the noise level was very acceptable. Prices seemed to be mostly under $14, so very reasonable for the quality of food. Not your run of the mill breakfast joint, so be adventurous. The wife and I will be returning for sure. Samantha was our server, the first server in arizona to ever give us a new set of silverware with our second course, what ever they are paying her it's not enough, gold star employee right there."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is the shizzzzz! I am a special order queen... I know... hair flip*. But I just like to try different things and don't eat everything I order. Side note- I want to open a restaurant that you can order smaller portions and not have so much waisted food or not be charged to split a plate. (Tapas) So... as I sat down I had to apologise to my dinning mate previous to my ordering because I know I am an embarrassing person to be around when I order.  The server came out and I looked at her with my sweet doe eyes and asked if I can have one waffle dry and a side of avacado toast. And to my surprise... I got an answer...Absolutely... she said. I just looked at her and yelled f*** are you seriouse! I love you! It was even more surprising  when I got the bill .. I never look at it anyways. But she charged me for one meal and a side of toast for a buck! Aw... ya and the food, the bathrooms and the atmosphere was outstanding. Thanks so much for curing my hangover with my amazing food and the amazing server who was so pleasant and so avaliable when we needed her. Job well f*ing done."}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed with food. I had a burrito and didn't like it at all. The layout and atmosphere was nice. They play good music and it has perfect volume."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of brunch, so I had to check out the brunch menu at this establishment. This restaurant is located inside the prominent Scottsdale Quarter. I love the indoor/outdoor dinning concept. Arizona is just way to gorgeous to not sit outside in their patio area to munch on delicious food. The management team, and the waitstaff here are friendly and accommodating.  Alright, let's get to the main event, that is the food. Let me just start by saying everyone in our group struggled to pick a favorite dish. We couldn't do it.  Sam, the owner, personally see to this menu. His vision was to present to the diners a menu that is both deliciously comforting , and healthy dishes without compromising on taste. With that in mind, let's start.  Portobello Spinach Eggs Benedict: eggs poached to perfection, and hollandaise sauce was on point. The portobello mushrooms accentuated the umami of this dish. A must order. Churro waffle is a dessert and breakfast all into one. A win-win pick. The blueberry French toast is both stunning and yumlicious. The Breakfast Toast was such a refreshing delight. I had mine with a sunny on top. The signature Breakfast Sandwich was pretty epic because this one also includes hash browns as well. The Shrimp Scampi omelette was DELICIOUS! There is just no way to explain this dish. A must taste for yourself kinda dish. Overall, this is a must visit restaurant for breakfast, brunch with the family or squad. Follow these peeps on Instagram and Facebook because they have pretty awesome promotions going on all the time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Kitchen Bar  Very upbeat modern restaurant. Music sets the mood and upbeat trendy place.  Ate outside on a Thursday for lunch and there were more people outside than inside.   We ordered the Hash Brown Pizza, Protein Pancakes and the Churro Waffle.  Hash Brown Pizza had eggs, bacon bits with swiss cheese. Bottom was a thick slab of has browns with swiss cheese on the middle with bacon bits and topped off with eggs. Good combination that really works well together.   Churro Waffle had ice cream,  strawberries, blueberries, and black berries. The concoction is very good together and very sweet and on the sugary side. If you have a sweet tooth, this is for you.  Protein Pancakes had blueberries and bananas with whip cream with 2 massive thick pancakes that take up the entire plate. More of on the wheat style pancakes, but pretty tasty.  Our waitress Lexi said this place just opened on Monday and we were there on Thursday. So she said they were still working things out. Lexi took care of us and was on top of everything.   I really like this place for the originality with the different spin on the dishes and out of the box thinking of just eggs and bacon.   One of the better breakfast restaurants in Phoenix, Scottsdale area and look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"SOOOOOO GOOD!!!! Every time I've ordered breakfast, it's been absolutely delicious! Prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend stopping by this place. The staff is fun and friendly, making your morning a lot brighter."}
{"text":"So so ... no flavor in the hollandaise, waffle came without berries or cream and was heavy, more like a bread. Boring"}
{"text":"Met up with the girls for a mimosa and breakfast.  The raspberry mimosa was tastey, but lose the sugar rim, it looked really gross and dirty.  Service was really slow yet it wasn't very crowded in there. The waiter was very personable. The place is super cute but whomever put $$ on the description forgot a couple of $$'s.  I had a veggie omelette and 2 mimosas and my tab was $32.  Those are resort prices!  The food was nothing to write home about!"}
