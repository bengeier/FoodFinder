{"text":"This store is awful. They're meant to do the thing where they turn the blizzard upside down, but I'd they did it here the ice cream would pour all over the counter. 
Sloshy mush."}
{"text":"$6 for their special combo. Ordered deluxe cheese burger combo and chicken strips. It came with a sundae and can be upgraded to a small blizzard for a buck! Good food and great ice cream for the price. Only down side is the service, the guy looked very depressing. :("}
{"text":"CAKE BUYERS BEWARE!!!! 

I love DQ products and NEVER had an experience like this one! 

My son's 8th birthday has just passed and this year he wanted a DQ cake. We decided to go to this location as it was close to the birthday party venue. The day before the pick up date we ordered the the cake design that my son was in love with. I made sure to confirm all the request of the cake decor with the order taker and as promised every detail would be done. 

The day of pick up, I called again in the morning to confirm if the cake was ready so we could pick it up and if was okay if someone else came to pick up other than myself, as I was stuck at the birthday venue. The store assured me that everything was ready and there was no problem.

 Once the cake arrived, I immediately noticed that the cake was decorated not as neat as the other cakes on display and a huge part of the decor was missing! I knew my son would be upset about this, so I tried my best to explain to him that it was a mistake and not to be upset on your birthday. My son was devastated!!! It was like if you had ordered a Superman cake without Superman???? The cake was a total waste! My son was soooooo upset that he didn't even eat it. 

After the party I called the store to speak with one of the managers, she offered me 25% off my next cake to shut me up! I told her that $7.65 will not change the fact that my son cried all over his cake and that ruined his birthday party!!! She told me that is all they could do for me and I would need to speak with another manager...... All I want is my $30.34 back for my cake and still to this day, through calling head office and speaking to other managers I have not been reimbursed. 

I will NEVER go back to this store again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Dairy Queen I have ever been to. Used to be pretty good but lately they must have hired new staff and it has gone downhill. The last two times I have gone to their drive through my blizzard was half melted when I got it, I asked for a fudge core, paid for it and didn't even get it. The second time a double checked, went back in and they informed me its nothing like it's advertised on tv it's only turns out to be a small ball of fudge. My I paid for extra cheesecake ingredient for my gf, she found 3 pieces. Not impressed, terrible value for your money. 

Better off going to McDonald's for a mcflurry they do fudge centre too, or making your own! Hard to find good help these days I'm thinking"}
{"text":"My friend came to this DQ. Let's call her Larry. Larry ordered a chocolate extreme blizzard. So you would think that the chocolate extreme would have a lot of brownie pieces as seen on the commercial, right? WRONG. Larry left the DQ sad, disappointed and ...... BROWNIELESS"}
{"text":"I have only eaten in once.  Most of the time I get drive thru.   The daughter loves their warm brownie with soft serve.  She can generally polish it off before we are home 15 minutes away.  

I like a small dipped cone.  However, I have noticed the drive thru passing mini cones instead of small cones.  

For dine-in fans, especially those with small kids, be mindful of trips in the afternoon.  There is a probation office a few doors down.  I guess after they are done they will also pop in.  I will just say the language can be a little salty and the attire of the customers questionable. 

Granted it is no Dairy Queen's fault. 

When I did dine-in I found the service slow.  But I find that the pick-up end of the counter can get congested waiting for you bill number to be called.  There just has to be a better way to service their customers."}
{"text":"Your regular Dairy Queen, nothing special. Good customer service and their ice cream is always top-notch."}
{"text":"Love Dairy Queen!  Blizzards, sundae, and good burgers.  Don't know why they don't promote the burgers more."}
{"text":"Ok super slow wait times, especially in the Summer.  I think they were understaffed.  But the brownie DQ blizzard was great!  I had one bite and then it DROPPED ON THE FLOOR!! But I went up to the cash and said I dropped it and they made a new one for me, right away for free!  Very nice of them!"}
