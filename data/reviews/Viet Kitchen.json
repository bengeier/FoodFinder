{"text":"This place is fantastic. Awesome pho, Great salad rolls, stir frys  and well just everything is really good. Definitely recommend trying it!!"}
{"text":"Had the Vietnam  fried rice for lunch. It was great!! Quick service too.  Although was just about to go back today but sign on door said \"no credit cards today\" sad. They lost my business today. I hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"The chicken Pho is really good. I have even got it to-go, and they did a great job packing and giving me everything I needed to eat it at home. The staff here are also really friendly. One note is that the restaurant is pretty small and it can get loud/busy during rush hours."}
{"text":"Tried the vegetarian pho with beef broth. Very fresh, great flavor, excellent soup! We will be back for sure! One of the best Pho soups I have ever had."}
{"text":"Craving some Vermicelli, we checked out this place recently.  Ordered 2 vermicelli dinners, steak and chicken.  Also started out with spring rolls.  This food was average to say the least.  Just ok.  Spring rolls mostly filled with lettuce, meat & herbs were scarce.  The vermicelli dinners were ok, but not amazing or anything.  Prices are good though and location is near home.  Not sure if we will be going back.  A fav Vietnamese rest. is farther and divey, but amazing and worth the drive."}
{"text":"I have my all time favorite Vietnamese restaurant in chandler but since I've moved up north I've struggled to find a comparable place. Well my search has ended! I absolutely love Viet Kitchen! Clean, friendly and fresh food! I never feel bogged down when I eat their food, so fresh and tasty! I highly recommend this place for authentic Vietnamese cuisine!!"}
{"text":"We love the pho here. The service is okay. I always feel like they are annoyed that I am there but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food, low prices, fast service.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I took my boyfriend here last weekend and he already wants to go back again. Delicious Pho and he really likes the noodles with beef. Clean, relaxed atmosphere and the people that work there are very nice. Tip- look online for their menu (the URL begins with \"redfork\") to see the full menu. The one at the restaurant is abbreviated for whatever reason"}
{"text":"Very nice little restaurant in cave creek area.  Family run restaurant.  Very Nice and polite owners.  I really like the pho there.  Thats what I get every time I go there."}
{"text":"I eat primarily the phô ga, or chicken soup, and it is the best I've had.  Always fast and courteous service,  reasonable pricing, and generous portions. I highly recommend their Vietnamese coffee and spring rolls as well!"}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER COME BACK AGAIN!!!  I moved to this area about one year ago and I have been coming here ever since.  I decided to order couple of items to go today.  When I picked up the food I kindly asked for more Sriracha and Hoisin sauce for my Pho.  The cashier looked at me weird and said that there was plenty with my food.  When I checked, I got a quarter of a one once container of each.  I asked if I could have some more and the cashier was very rude and said I would have to pay extra.  REALLY?! I just grabbed some Sriracha from a table and left.  I will never come to this place again!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in Phoenix hands down. I've eaten Pho everywhere in town including all the ones near 15th Ave and camelback.    That said Viet Kitchen adds a spice that's slightly different than all other Pho joints,  it's unusual at first but good.  Then after a few visits you will crave this Pho above all others.   Really no other place will do,  the Vegan Pho is also Great as well"}
{"text":"We walked in with 3 little kids and two adults. There was a table available but she wants to move in the middle of just in case you need that big table...how rude Then we sat down for 10 minutes and she won't even come by and take our orders. The kids were hungry so we decided to leave and go next-door for sandwich Very very poor service I would never be back"}
{"text":"Really like this food. Vietnamese is my favorite food and they do a great job at a very good price. I love the vermicelli dish. Great consistency and quality ingredients. Taste so good."}
{"text":"We always see this restaurant everytimrle we go to Costco. This time we decided to try it and were pleasantly surprised.  It is good."}
{"text":"\"Buyer beware\"    They have to update their menu.  There are several items on menu they no longer serve and menus on items that are not even close to the picture.  When asked about why items are not given, waitress states that there customers are non-ethnic therefore food quality and taste is catered to that customer base.  (This translates to a less authentic menu and dining experience).  Experience becomes frustrating and waitress response was very defensive which made for awkward moment.  There's potential, but there are also better Vietnamese restaurants.    Doesn't any one feel that they have the most uncomfortable chairs?    I agree with Jeff Y, but I'd rather go to Da Vang instead.    (Like this review if you agree)"}
{"text":"The service isn't bad, but was awfully slow when I went there. The owner could definitely hire a server or two ... the place was busy and she was really the one taking food orders. The food wasn't half bad though."}
{"text":"Great place for PHO (fah), I had the beef meatball and as an appetizer this rice pancake and Vietnamese spring roll.  Quite nice, comfortable atmosphere, and clean.  Even though its at cave Creek and the 101 (Beardsley) we will be back."}
{"text":"My family used to go there for dinner because they had decent phos and spring rolls. However, while having pho a few days ago, I found a small piece of kitchen wrap in my steak pho. I told the lady what happened and she said sorry... DAS IT.   Overall not so great services and bad hygiene. I'm not going back!"}
{"text":"I read about Vietnam Kitchen in the Phoenix Magazine.  The service was some of the worst I have ever experienced.  Perhaps they were understaffed, but they were not pleasant.  We waited for almost 15 minutes to have our order taken.  Then, we waited 30 minutes for our food. They never offered to refill our drinks.  We had Pho which was delicious, however, they never gave us the garnishes.  The cabbage chicken salad was absolutely delicious as was the Curry Chicken.  When we finished, we waited for five minutes.  They never brought the bill.  I went to the counter to ask for the bill.  They handed it to me with not any comment at all.  No thank you, etc.  I noticed that all patrons had to go up to the counter for the bill.  I would give the food a 5 star rating and the service no stars."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall, but worth it! I'm visiting from LA and wanted Vietnamese and stumbled on this place. I didn't have high hopes since Southern California has a wide variety of viet food.   My waiter was very friendly and very accommodating to my table. I had the bun bo hue which was very good and filling. It was very surprising to find that this place does not serve your typical viet food that non-viets love but rather serve very traditional viet plates that remind me of my mother's cooking  I recommend this place for those who are trying to step up their viet food game and try other viet foods other than pho and spring rolls.   Highly recommend this place will definitely be coming back next time I take a visit to sin city"}
{"text":"We love this place!  It's affordable and delicious!  My favorite dishes are the chicken noodle soup, house fried rice, and egg rolls.  Keep in mind that they are not what you would expect when you order these types of dishes, but they are amazing.  They recently switched to more comfortable chairs in the restaurant too, which I am very happy about.  We also love to order take-out from here when we don't want to take our toddler to a restaurant."}
{"text":"We knew that Viet Kitchen was good even before we ate the food; the aromas are wonderful! Once we had the food, it only confirmed what we suspected . . . .this place is terrific. It is now one of our favor ties in Phoenix.   Hong is very nice, she is helpful in choosing a dish, she explains what the dish is, and the fresh ingredients that go into making it, etc.   If you are lucky enough to have leftovers when done (the food is so good it is difficult to stop eating it), it makes a great meal the next day!   The soups are Spring Rolls are sooooooo good! The food is better than any of this variety that I have had growing up in Chicago.   This place is A+++  Rick & Donna, Phoenix AZ"}
{"text":"Pho tai and pancake got me sick.  Diarrhea and nausea.  Yech.  Pho flavor was decent.  Doesn't make up for the suffering."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. I love their chicken pho. I have also tried the chicken in coconut curry and it was really good. I wud say that their pho is the best in the valley."}
{"text":"Considering how close this place is to my apartment...I'm happy.  Happy Pho Time means:   1. Cures my hangover 2. Piping Hot when it gets to the table 3.A fresh, flavorful taste with lots of garnishes 4. Good Service  = Happy Me  and their Thai Tea was REALLY good."}
{"text":"Love the veggie pho!  I am a vegan and there are only a few places I can eat out.  I love the veggie pho and the veggie spring rolls.  The food is always fresh and delicious and affordable!  My sister loves the brisket pho and we are both now addicted!  My brother in law likes the chicken with fried rice.  I'm sure there will be other things on the menu that are great too but we have only been there a few times.  We always get take out but the place is cute, great ambiance, clean and has a big screen tv."}
{"text":"Overall, it's a good place to grab a healthy vietnamese bite.  The location is great since there is very little on this side of town in the way of vietnamese cuisine.  Although the portion sizes are generous and the value good, the menu selection was very limited.    The vietnamese spring rolls, Goi Cuon, are shrimp (wish they had BBQ pork) but tasty.  The rice vermicelli with beef, Bun Thit Nuong, was just OK.  I couldn't tell what spice was being used but there was a very different flavor to this dish (just OK).  The beef salad, #2E Goi Thit Bo, was quite tasty and I would recommend this dish.    Overall, if you're looking for a Vietnamese restaurant in North Phoenix, this place is worth going to."}
{"text":"What a great place. If you like Vietnamese food, this is the place. The location is great. Get off the 101 at Cave Creek and it's right there. Everything is good. I'm a creature of habit and the Pho with rare steak and meatballs is my favorite. I always go for that."}
{"text":"Very good food. If ever again visiting in Carefree we would return. The pho chicken had good flavor and came in a generous portion size. The barbecue pork with noodles according to DH was \"excellent\". Make this a stop on your list if ever in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place .... And have been in here more times than I can count .....coming from New York City this place is really good !  *there are ALWAYS  people in here ( sometimes I worry I won't get a table )  *never had a problem with communication with any of the staff **love that this place brings culture to AZ, we need more of these little places to thrive and stick around ***I order a veggie And tofu pho with beef broth and Thai iced tea ****It's always been consistent  Keep in mind this is a small busy place , don't knock it down because of \"service \" sit eat pay and go. FYI I always got my pho within 10 -15 min or less :)"}
{"text":"Food....really great pho. I enjoy the house special. A little bit pricey for what you get but try cooking you're own pho and well you know why these places are successful.  Ambiance....clean and nicely decorated. I always order takeout so I can't really comment on the atmosphere.  Staff...friendly unless you ask them for more hoisin/ sriracha.  Verdict....a great place to pick up some on the go pho."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  The food is awesome and the prices are right in line.  I'm new to Vietnamese food but I like what I've tried so far.  Try it out; the staff is friendly  and quick!"}
{"text":"Yellow curry with a side of bread...so good. Such a comfort food for me and they do it so well.  Creamy yet spicy and sweet.  Good price and portion sizes, service is hit and miss but usually based on how busy they are."}
{"text":"A good Vietnamese restaurant in this part of phoenix. I really like this place but its just a little more expensive than most Vietnamese places with bowls of pho usually costing 8 dollars and stirfry and other dishes from 9 to 11. The food does come in good portions and is good quality and tastes awesome. It's very clean and organized and the staff is nice. The menu is a good size and offers plenty of vegetarian and few vegan options. I'd recommend the house stirfry and beef pho  :)"}
{"text":"Wow, this is the real deal.  We just got back from lunch.  Being from LA, I still haven't found Vietnamese food as good here in Phoenix as back home.  This place is every bit as good.  The best bowl of PHO i've had, hands down.  And besides PHO they have a very extensive menu of authentic Vietnamese dishes.  The place is immaculate and the ingredients very fresh.  We've been waiting for this place to open and it was totally worth the wait.  You've got to try it."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend from Taiwan. We often go to Vietnam together and enjoy great Vietnamese food, especially Pho.   We are here because I was going to Costco.   We both ordered beef Pho. There were a few slices of tough beef, but the main ingredient was some type of inedible meatball that looked and tasted like it came out of a can.   That being said, I give the place 2 stars and not 1 or none because the service was good and the staff friendly.   However, I will never go back."}
{"text":"Wow. After seeing all the great reviews on Yelp we decided to try out Viet Kitchen, since it's right next to the Costco we go to all the time. We've had our share of Vietnamese food, so there were high hopes going in. Obviously, it didn't turn out so great. It all started when the lady took two separate parties' orders first even though they came after us...  We ordered fresh spring rolls, which usually comes with an awesome peanut sauce to dip in. However, when the rolls came, the wrapper was so thin it ripped, it was mostly lettuce and hardly any pork/shrimp inside, and the worst part was the peanut sauce tasted like nothing. Not a hint of peanut. Had to add some hoisin sauce to give it taste.   I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup (similar to bun bo hue), and the lady asked to make sure I wanted it hot and spicy. I answered with an enthusiastic yes, and the g/f ordered the pork combo sandwich. The food took a while, and the sandwich actually came much after the noodle soup. How long does it take to make a sandwich? What's even worse, there was hardly anything stuffed between each bun (see picture posted). I wish I took a picture of my \"spicy\" soup...normally with a spicy soup the soup is red, but mine was clear with a dab of redness here and there. I had to supplement it with a LOT of sriracha sauce...definitely not impressed.   On top of it all, the servers (different from the one that took the order) who brought the food were not friendly at all. They didn't say a word when putting our food on the table, and when we thanked them they didn't reply. This is definitely not a place we will be going back to; if there's ever a pho or noodle soup craving I'd rather drive down to Central Phoenix to Maxim Restaurant."}
{"text":"Will not come back. Food is average but the service is terrible.   The Pho is not impressive but OK and their egg rolls are made from refrigerated product with some unrecognizable stuff inside!!  The service is among the worst I've ever experienced. The waitress/owner gave a face like a stone and didn't even say a word when taking our order. The only one word we got there was a \"Thanks\" when she bring the check.... Since we were the only Asian customers there and all others were getting normal service, I may have to establish an assumption that the way you are treated is correlated to your looking. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"this place is a gem great food and fast service. from their soups to their noodles so so tasty well worth the trip"}
{"text":"The service here is the sole reason it receives 1 star.  The past 3 experiences are summed up like this:  Restaurant closed early, made us order take out.  (WHY HAVE POSTED HOURS IF THEY DON'T MEAN ANYTHING?).  2nd trip, we showed up a half hour before closing and when we walked in the server literally looked at her watch and said we close in 30 minutes.  That's a first, I've never seen that before.  Most people already understand that when working in a restaurant, some tables might be still sitting at their table after closing, it happens, it's called THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS, and you take the good with the bad!  3rd trip, we ordered our food and drinks, and our waitress never came back.  I had to flag her down to get refills for drinks after they'd been empty for 15 minutes, ironically, she only got half our tables their drinks, the other half had to share our drinks.  Horrible service every time.  These folks might want to learn how operate a restaurant from the customer service side of things.  You can have great food, but with terrible service you'll lose customer after customer.....they've lost my families business!"}
{"text":"The Viet Kitchen is still my favourite place for Pho.  Kim and Jenny are wonderful and as Anthony N mentioned \"the owner gets to know you and calls you by name\".  That type of atmosphere certainly does enhance the dining experience.    I do however have to disagree with him that their food is not the absolute best.  Every time I go, as soon as my Pho arrives, my bum starts to do it's happy dance in their new, very comfortable chairs.  As the first spoonful hits my mouth I'm practically wiggling out of the seat.    Since their Pho is really the only thing I ever order it is the only thing I can speak to as being, at least for me, the absolute best.  If you want spectacular Pho with a flavourful, delicious broth you need to visit Jenny and Kim at the Viet Kitchen and tell them Karen says HI, she'll be in soon!!!"}
{"text":"I occasionally work nearby and when I am able, I eat lunch here. The pho is great and they do a brisk lunch business so you know it's good stuff!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy their food when I go in to dine, but I recently ordered Togo yellow curry, and when I checked it at home it was miso soup!!!! Green! Not even yellow, I called them and they said they would make me a new one. I got there and the woman told me that's \"curry\" when it clearly wasn't and she'd only give me a refund! Like come on now you'd rather give me a refund when I come there often than fix your mistakes that were so clear!"}
{"text":"I have only eat the Pho so my review is biased but the Pho is dang good. Best I have had in Phoenix at a restaurant. So far only my bro's wife makes better Pho!"}
{"text":"Great place.  My girl friend and I were driving to pho aviana on the other side of town before we found this place. The Pho is great but our favorite is the charbroiled beef. well seasoned beef with vegetables and rice with fish sauce to dip the beef in, just amazing.   Today I tried the BBQ beef sandwich with one of my coworkers, best sandwich i have ever had. I paid four dollars for a wonderful beef sandwich loaded with fresh produce (cilantro, carrots and onions) and a great sauce all in a loaf of french bread. I think I convinced my coworker that viet kitchen is the best Vietnamese food in the north valley.    As far as service, they are wonderful. Dinning in is almost like sitting at your parents house. The main hostess ( i dont know her name) make you feel right at home. She knows exactly what we like and comments on how happy she is to see me and my girlfriend try new things. Every waitress is quick to fill your glass and you always get a thank you for coming in and have a nice night when you leave.  over all a wonderful dinning experience and its some where that I will never stop going to."}
{"text":"Waitresses were nice and had smiles at first. The cook brought out our soups and forced them on the table in front of us even though we were still eating our spring rolls. When she reached across to put down my girlfriends soup, her arm rubbed on my spring roll! The manager/owner refused to give me a discount. She said she could give us another spring roll and I agreed. When she went into the kitchen she told the employees what i said and all the staff looked out of the kitchen at us. That was very rude. They were not as friendly after that. The soup was good and the egg rolls were fair. Looking for another Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were doing laundry next door and wanted something to eat. Decided to go here, and we weren't disappointed. They don't have pho, but they do have other good soups. I even tried duck for the first time - I would describe it as chicken 2.0. Delicious."}
{"text":"I think if I ever went back here I would get a noodle soup without any meat. I had to pretend that the \"tenderloin\" was not actually in the bowl. It was kind of like they put some unsalted jerky in the broth...   Soup great; meat prepared poorly. Don't get me wrong - not bad meat, just badly prepared meat.   Spring rolls were average. Prices and value pretty good. Packed at lunch and would have liked a little cooler temperature inside."}
{"text":"Taste of food: average Service: way below average ( asked for more basil leaves for pho Saigon, the server said needs to pay $2.00 for extra basil. I was so shocked as I have been to so many Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix and this is the only one asked for $2.00 for extra basil!) Price: higher than the rest of Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix.  Besides, I noticed that when the price of commodity went up, they will reduce that ingredients in your food. I used to order their spicy stir fry chicken. Chicken breast price was high 6-7 months ago.. I can't believe that I paid $8.50 before tax for only 3 pieces of chicken.... It was too bad as I only found out when I reach home..... How to argue with them? They might say I have eaten the chicken.... I should have taken picture to post here... But now chicken price has dropped so the chicken in this dish were more than before.....  If you don't believe me, just observe yourself then you will notice.."}
{"text":"Looking for great Vietnamese food?  This is the place. It's kind of a small \"hole in the wall\" but very clean and the food is superb. I've been there many times and it is always great."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. Peanut sauce has no flavor and is watery- every time. Rude staff on a few occasions. Time to find a good place."}
{"text":"Everything I order was delicious and the lady that made my strawberry boba was very nice. She made sure I wanted boba inside since yelp didn't have an option for with or without. I a supposed it can with. So see added it in before I left."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today with my mom and toddler son. My mom and I were both very excited to try Pho for the first time. The place was pretty busy when we first arrived, but started to clear out before we were seated. After checking out the menu and chatting for awhile, we realize we have been sitting for at least 15 minutes and no one had come over to take our order, or even acknowledge us and offer us water. We waited at least 10-15 MORE minutes,  getting frustrated at the complete lack of acknowledged ment. The waitresses kept walking by constantly, but no one never even looked at us. The final straw was when I looked over at the table of girls who were seated at almost exactly the same time as us, and they wer happily eating their food. We got up and walked out. I'm sure the food is delicious, it smelled great, but waiting half an hour, with a toddler, and not ever being acknowledged is completely unacceptable. Terrible service, I'm not even going to try to go back."}
{"text":"We come here for the noodles. Our favorite is the 7A rice noodle combo. Everything we have tried here is very good but the noodles are the best!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the egg rolls.  So glad that they were made out of fried rice paper because I have food allergies.  The entree of BBQ beef with rice noodles was also very good.  I will be going back this weekend with the hubby for sure.  Very clean and nicely decorated restaurant.  Very nice waitress. The restaurant smelled really good too: spices maybe?  A bit warmer than I would like inside.  Maybe they need to turn up the A/C."}
{"text":"They must have had a slammed lunch as I came in around 1:30 ( by the time I found my way back from the old station) and for a new place the counters were dirty.   I hate when the counter help is eating in the dining room, I feel like I am inconveniencing them.  The vegetarian choices are limited and the Pho was good for 8 bucks.  I have eaten Pho at another place in Mesa and enjoyed it more.  I won't run back to this one but if someone else was paying and wouldn't cave to other suggestions I would not die of it either."}
{"text":"I got the beef pho to go and I was very impressed! Speedy service. Very good will return."}
{"text":"Very good Food, with the right spices, good customer service, nice environment. Whoever is into eating healthy this is the way to go. I had tofu with rice and it was delicious"}
{"text":"Meet up with the hubby for lunch at this Solid Pho location. Service here is prompt and friendly. The location is small but welcoming.  Portions are hearty and good. The spring rolls are fresh and the Pho broth is a bit on the salty side but I added  sirracha and chili to the soup and it was yum!  Located off of Cavecreek and south of the 101 we were happy to find this convenient and delicious spot."}
{"text":"We had to try this place out because one of our favorite Vietnamese restaurant closed early on Sunday so we had to try this place.  We ordered the Pho soups, and we were hoping it would be the same as we were used to; boy oh boy we were wrong. Their Pho soup is not good at all. I had the Chicken Pho soup and it was terrible. My wife ordered the Veggie and Tofu Pho soup and she didn't like it either.  We also ordered the veggie spring rolls. Both were \"broken\" when got home; they weren't tightly wrapped. We didn't finish our soup nor the rolls, and we can say it was a waste of $20. Definitely NOT coming back to Viet Kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  They have wonderful pho.  The salads are amazing and I really like how they serve green iced tea.  I've had many items from their menu and each time I'm pleased.  This place is good to introduce others to different cuisines and expand your palette beyond traditional american fare.  My only complaint is I wish they had boba drinks!  Definitely amazing if you want to try real \"ramen\" or other dishes.  The hot pots are loads of fun!!  Think melting pot but Vietnamese style!  And the decor is fun.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've had Vietnamease at several other places in town always go back to Viet Kitchen you can really taste the deep flavors in there Pho. And there spring roles are really grate way to start a meal . I could eat there every day."}
{"text":"Awful service. The sign says they close at 9, we got there at 8:25 and the girl that greater us said we close at 9. Ok? Then came over and was super rude at our table. Another couple walked in at 8:37 and she said \"were closed\". \"We close the kitchen at 8:45\". The couple didn't look happy. Food was ok, service was terrible. I will never be back. I will spend my money were its appreciated."}
{"text":"environment is elegant and quiet. spring rolls are delicious. Not a big fan of their pho broth though."}
{"text":"The food here is so fresh. The broth in the soup is one of the best in town. The decor gives you the feel like you are in Vietnam for just a moment in time. The staff is always nice, friendly, and makes sure you are taken care of."}
{"text":"Viet Kitchen has superb food. Friendly staff who are welcoming and accommodating. The food is fresh, clean and fulfilling."}
{"text":"Visited today for lunch - I like vietnamese food but it is hard to find on this side of town.  I had the standard vermicelli bowl with beef/pork.  I found it tasty and agree their spicing is a bit under stated.  Nice array of condiments provided so one can dial in the exact taste they desire.  Service was prompt and courteous - an overall postivie experience.  One plus - they know how to make tea!  served loose in the pot, a nice house blend with some aromatics.  The menu is a bit impenetrable and the pictures somewhat random - some better descriptors would be good"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile but I went to the Costco in the complex and it reminded me of how great this place is.  The food is great, first of all.  I've had a few different dishes here and I always go back to the pho.  The initial indicator of pho quality, to me, is the soup's temperature.  I hate, hate, hate when I get a bowl of warmish soup.  I want it hot.  When it shows up only a little warm or tepid, it means a) the soup wasn't hot enough when you placed in the meat or b) frozen meat was dropped in my hot soup.  Boo.  I know that restaurants use frozen meat but I don't want it to be apparent, either.  The pho here has been hot and delicious, whenever I've ordered it.  The little Vietnamese sandwiches are pretty good too.  My Dad and I usually split a sandwich and each order a bowl of pho.  Speaking of my Dad, my second point: My Father and I replaced the floor of my entire condo with laminate flooring.  If you've done it (correctly) you know it's messy.  My Dad doesn't do fast food so for helping me out, I would get us Viet Kitchen.  I worried that the staff would give us weird looks or somehow treat us differently for showing up sweaty and covered in dust.  They didn't.  They were extremely friendly; inviting us to the bar to sit, chatting with us and pouring us glasses of water while we waited for our takeout.  I felt special.  I will ALWAYS remember that. People who recognize and welcome people who work hard are likely people who work hard, themselves."}
{"text":"I had the bbq beef vermicelli and the Vietnamese eggrolls. Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"I really do like this place.    Its by my school and I will visit the place often enough that they know me when I come in.  I am into the rare steak pho but also enjoy their hot pot if you are ever in the mood to do the wrapping yourself :)  Prompt service, the drinks are quick and topped off.  The place is clean and acoustically not too loud so that talking isn't a problem.  The food is fantastic and you always get a beautiful display of the food as well.  Not ones to just throw things on a place its arranged and coming out as a temptation for your eyes as well as for the palate.    My wife actually enjoys the chicken here when she was asking about Non-spicy food.  No problem at all and it was a wonderful dish.  I highly recommend this place and for 7(+tax and tip so tip well) bucks a bowl thats a meal is great value."}
{"text":"One of my favorite vietnamese places...beware if your looking for pho this isn't the place! This place specializes in vietnamese food that are more authentic and exotic, compared to other vietnamese restaurants...I love the bun bo hue, escargot, and beef salad!!bomb.com"}
{"text":"So, I guess this is my local phô place.  I ate here once before, when they had first opened up, and felt it was just average. I decided to try it again as it is slightly closer to me than central Phoenix. What can I say? I had an itch that needed to be scratched.  I ordered the house special phô and a café sua da. The latter came all fancy, premixed in a tall glass. While I appreciate the effort, I'm really into the traditional little drippy cup you get at most places. It makes the drink more of a ritual, and better tasting too.  On to the phô: I am not exaggerating when I say that this was the most aromatic (in a great way) phô i've ever had! There were definitely some extra spices at play: cardamon maybe, definitely extra anise, and probably extra cloves as well. As far as a big ol' delicious bowl of special phô goes, it was great. lots of tendon, not too heavy on the tripe, flavorful, piping hot broth, rare and well-done beef, meatballs, lots of noodles, fresh bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, jalapeno peppers, lime wedge, etc. Definitely not the best I've ever had, but definitely above average, tasty, and worth the short drive from Deer Valley.   I'd reward them another star if they had more options, like lunch combos or something like that. For the price, there are other Vietnamese places in the Valley that give you more for your money, including flavor.  I'll be back to try the sandwiches soon enough, and maybe the egg rolls as well."}
{"text":"Quick, yummy and satisfying. Love this place!  Not sure what else to say, because I haven't explored the menu past the house Pho- it's so good I can't bring myself to pass it up."}
{"text":"Still a favorite for Pho!  Great Veg pho and my family really likes the beef.  Quaint and clean.  They are always really nice."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time eating at this place and both times were very good. I love pho. Something about a big bowl of pho is something that I crave from time to time. The pho is great. I think the bowls are a little small but the flavor is awesome. I have had their spring rolls which were great as well. Overall pretty solid place would recommend and go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in the valley. I have been to a few and by far this is the best. The service is great. all the staff is friendly, nice, quiet atmosphere, very clean. The spring rolls are always fresh and tasty. I moved but still makes the 15 trip just to eat there."}
{"text":"The place is a true gem . I've been coming here for awhile .. Hands down best Pho & egg rolls in PHX !  Some pure idiot left a review that was less then nice about there tasteless Spring Rolls & peanut sauce . His head needs to be checked . But then I seen he was a Regular At Jake & Box . Please don't ever walk in to my VK & say any thing bad about there food cause it is AMAZING !!!!"}
{"text":"Was so surprised to stumble across their Yelp page and not see a higher rating. Whenever I'm in this part of town I always make sure to stop here. It's a great family owned business and the owners couldn't be nicer. They have great traditional pho and all of the dishes are great. Even if you're not in the mood for pho the chicken cabbage salad is very tasty. Ask them to crack open a coconut for you if you like coconut water as well."}
{"text":"This is not our normal Vietnamese place. We stopped in today on way back into town. Maybe today was an exception for this place but based on this experience I would not return or recommend it to anyone.  I ordered pork and shrimp rice plate. I ended up getting beef and shrimp. Figured innocent mistake, bit the beef was more like jerky. I did eat as much as I could. But hours later I'm still nauseous.  My wife got fish ball soup. It was watered down, no taste."}
{"text":"I've seen this place for 5 years. I went to UPS that's down the way from Viet Kitchen and it smelled wonderful and the UPS clerk said working there is torture because if all the wonderful smells from Viet Kitchen. So I talked my co-worker into going. The place is bigger than I thought, it was already hopping at 11:30 am. We were seated right away, didn't have to wait long for a server so we got our drinks pretty quick. I ordered the 7b and it was pretty freaking good. I'm pretty sure they don't use msg in this dish  because I had to add soy sauce. I also added chili pepper sauce and then gave it a squeeze of lime juice. Yummy! I absolutely loved this place and definitely will be going back. Go get your noodle fix on and get the 7b."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars because the place was clean, the workers were polite, friendly and responsive, and the pho was really tasty.  Good broth and lots of chicken as well as alot of the regular accompaniments - no skimping here!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is excellent (I've tried most things on the menu) and hte people are very nice as well.  It's clean and fast, but not rushed.  If you like Pho, then you must go!"}
{"text":"DON'T EVER ORDER HOT POT HERE!!!!! If you do, welcome to join the huge rip off!!!  Well, as a customer for years (seriously! years!! because we live so close to it and this is the only asian restaurant nearby!), tonight we surprisingly  found out they have hot pot on their menu, so we decided to give it a try. However, we've never experienced vietnamese hot pot before, we did expected something different from Chinese hot pot or Japanese hot pot, but we didn't expect this is such a rip off!!!  1. Refer to the image I'm attaching: customers need to place two orders to be able to get the hot pot thing, so we ordered \"Beef & Shrimp\" and \"Seafood,\" when the raw food arrive, I was like WTF, that's it? You might think this amount of shrimp and beef is quite a bit, but let me tell you this thing cost $15.99. In this restaurant, a big bowl of house noodle (which includes everything) is about $8-ish, and the seafood which costs us $16.99 with 2 SHRIMPS, 5 PIECES OF SQUID, several BEAN SIZE SCALLOPS, and some beef. Well they did serve some veggies and noodle (all raw) on the side, but seriously????? $16.99 is an all-you-can-eat price in other same level Asian restaurants!! And look at the so-call HOT POT! It's the same size as my dad's hand!!  2. Poor communication. We asked for hot pot, the waitress acts like we are retarded or something. We saw the other table ordered hot pot, so we said to her we want THAT, and of course we asked if this is similar to the Chinese hot pot. She didn't explain at all, at the end she asked which one we like, butter or vinegar. Well we didn't know what those are for so we picked butter. I swear, she didn't say anything at that time, then when our food finally arrived, they gave us a FU*KING PAN! WE ORDERED HOT POT NOT HOT PAN! HELLO?? Then she explain because we asked for butter, and butter is for the hot pan and vinegar is for hot pot, WTF??? That is how you treat your customer without any explanation before place the order in the kitchen???  3. THE ENTIRE NIGHT THE WAITRESS WERE GIVING US AN ATTITUDE BECAUSE WE ASKED TO SWITCH TO WHAT WE WANTED TO ORDER.   4. CONCLUSION: THE HOT POT SUCKS! THE FOOD WAS SO LITTLE EVEN MY 4 FOOT MOM COULDN'T GET FILL UP! Service was horrible, we waited for so long because of they messed up the order and they didn't even say sorry, but keep giving us attitude and rude!   F this place, never come back again!"}
{"text":"We walked in thinking that we can get Banh Mi sandwiches (this place use to be Ba Le Sandwich), and found out that it is a new restaurant. The owner told us that it is 20% off for grand opening, so we decided to dine there. They do not have sandwiches, but they will in the future according to him.  I had Com (rice) dish, and my husband tad Bun Bo Hue (noodle dish). They were both good, and my dish had so much food. I had to take 1/2 of the dish home.  The price is competitive to other Vietnamese restaurant.  The owner was very attentive and polite. He made sure our dining experience was pleasant and wanted us to come back again. We sure will! He even asked for any input/feedback for their food and service.  I had fried rice to go at the end of the dinner. It was just okay. I guess its better to stick with typical Vietnamese dish in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pros:  Nice atmosphere, plenty of parking. Cha giò is served 3 per order instead of the usual 2 found in most other Vietnamese restaurants.   Cons: I ordered Cha giò (fried spring rolls). The wrapping was thin and crisp as it should be but the filling was not up to expectations. There was an ample amount of ground meat in the roll but very little else leaving it rather \"dry\" and very definitely needing the dipping sauce. The lettuce and greens traditionally supplied with the rolls were sparse indeed, 2 small pieces of lettuce, 2 stalks of mint and a few strands of parsley...barely enough for 2 rolls and certainly not enough for 3 rolls.  The \"Vietnamese curry\" was \"light and thin\" with some cubed meat (very, very dry)  assorted veg...carrots, onions and some potatoes (the potatoes tasted as though they had been roasted then refrigerated before making it into the curry) . The main  taste in the curry was white and black pepper. It should have tasted more of \"curry.\"  The portion, unlike the \"Cha giò\" was not ample....  Service was just \"OK\" with no checking back once the food was served, water not refilled...this, in spite of the fact that the restaurant was only about 1/2 full at the \"late lunch\" time frame in which I was served.   Several other diners were served large bowls of pho ... looked good...perhaps I should have ordered that...."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing food. Highly recommend this little joint to anyone that likes Pho. Thank you for the nice evening and dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is a great little jem.  The food prep is fast so you will be sitting and eating in less than 15 min.  Vegie spring rolls wefe just ok- little flavor and ice berg lettec was used.  I had the cabbage chicken salad.  It had an undertone of fish sauce with lemon and vinegar. Also the chicken was boiled so  I didnt like it.  My friend ordered the vegie pho and enjoyed her meal.  This was my first time to the place so i will be back to try more items.  I suggest to go and try for yourself."}
{"text":"So far I've only done carry-out here but the Traditional Pho is phenomenal.  Always courteous and prompt with my order."}
{"text":"Love their beef pho, but the chicken pho is okay.  Service is friendly and the meals are always consistently wonderful.  Warm goodness in a bowl.  I have had their spring rolls too and they are amazing!  I saw the curry the other day and it looked great, but I love the pho so much I just can't seem to order it."}
{"text":"We ordered pho take out through the yelp app. Food was great. My complaint is that we prepaid the order also through the yelp ordering system, however when my husband went to pick up they announced that they raised prices and we owe $8 more on a $32 order. Just because you forgot to update prices somewhere that should be on you, not the customer. I think they are full of it."}
{"text":"When giving two stars, the Yelp Star selector says \"Meh. I've experienced better\" and strangely enough the word \"Meh\" is flagged on Yelp's own spell checker. This is puzzling to me. How is it that Yelp can use the word \"Meh\" yet their own spell checker rejects the use of this oh so appropriate verbiage, especially when describing Viet Kitchen. I work really close to this little place, which is always very clean and is staffed by some very nice folk. The menu selection is ample yet typical of any Vietnamese fair... Pho, Vermicelli dishes, French type sandwiches, spring rolls, etc.  But everything I've had is just.... here it comes..... you know what I'm gonna say.... you guessed it..... MEH. Nothing is great, everything is just ok. Where's the love? This is how I feel about the place. If you're completely Jonesing (another term not in spell checker) for Vietnamese food, this place will satisfy your craving, but after your meal you might end up saying \"Meh, I've experienced better\"."}
{"text":"I've tried my share of dishes from this place and unfortunately the quality ranges from mediocre to below average. The issue varies from food being not properly seasoned or even being fresh. There are simply better options in other parts of town."}
{"text":"- We were there for St. Patty's Day, March 17th       I was introduced to this nicely hidden spot by my best amiga Ly, she suggested their food for our St. Patty's celebration. We had for starters the rolls with the Romaine lettuce and they were pretty tasty after we added some of their hot sauce, and ultra hot as in temperature, both myself and Chris burnt ourselves, but that was our own fault, yes it was funny :) .      The Chicken Pho (Fauh) was great, hot, minty rich flavor and the noodles were well cooked too!!! Such BIG portions though, neither Ly nor myself finished our bowls. But they were OH SOO Delicious.        Thanks for the amazing meal and great time!!"}
{"text":"Constantly delicious food combined with a super friendly staff make this a favorite spot for my wife and me. Everything we have tried has been pascked with flavor!"}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie pho (with tofu) and the iced condensed coffee. Yum! Both were heavenly. Seriously. This marks the first time I actually sought out the little cubes of tofu and ate them willingly. The hoisin, sriracha & other spices were already on the table. I like my pho spicy and I spent the entire time wiping away the spice induced tears. It was fabulous. Bean sprouts, basil & lime extras were brought with the order. The broth was super aromatic (cinnamon? allspice?) and tasty. It was a good portion. Slightly pricy at $7 but it was raining outside and totally worth it. I will be back to try the bahn mi."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try Pho for the first time and will be back soon for seconds. The place smells AMAZING as you walk in. Only complaint is it was on the warm side so I was glad to not be staying but just picking up a to go order. The dish was so delicious and more than enough for two huge helpings. The herbs, jalapeño, sprouts and limes were all fresh and gorgeous even after the 15 minute ride home and sit before I got down to eating. The noodles were perfect and finished up cooking in the hot broth as I did the assembly. I also picked up spring rolls but those will be lunch tomorrow. They look gorgeous and I expect will taste great too."}
{"text":"I have never had Pho and decided today was the day to give it a try. Viet Kitchen is nearby and had received a lot of positive reviews on Yelp. I decided on the House Pho which consisted of thinly sliced rare beef, broth, noodles and your typical pho garnishing. I enjoyed the taste of the pho but thought the beef was a little tough. I also decided on the takeout option, I wonder if it would've been better if I dined in.  I will go to Viet Kitchen again but try something different and use the dine-in option."}
{"text":"The pho here is decent, but a little less tasty than others I've had.   The vietnamese coffee is nice and strong with a lot of UMMPPHHH! So much UMMPPHH in fact that I had to request extra condensed milk to weaken the UMMPPH.  But the service here was pretty frickin' good. Maybe it's because the owner recognizes The Boyfriend as a semi regular, but when we came here, not only were we seated and orders taken right away, but the server (owner?) checked on us more than once and seemed genuinely friendly. She offered to add tofu to my dish and also offered the extra condensed milk. She had no qualms with giving us a to go cup for the rest of our vietnamese coffee either. If I could, I'd give an extra half star for great service!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The chicken Pho is my favorite, and the Thai tea is delicious. Their portions are very generous for the price! I am a regular and I will continue to get my Pho here :)"}
{"text":"OMG. I love love love this place. All the food is incredible. My favorite is the Prime Pho, my fiancé always gets the Pho Bo(meatball). We also get the Vietnamese egg rolls. The best!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for a great pho.  The vermacilli there is delicious and not to mention the Po boy sandwiches are bomb.  Highly recommend this place to any one searching for a new regular place to go"}
{"text":"not a fan of this place, espoecially when from where I was sitting I had to obseve them scrubbing the kitchen floor (at 5PM) and then get up and make food while walking on the soapy floor...not sure if they washed their hands...kinda grossed me out.  Food was overpriced and not that good."}
{"text":"PHO IS SUB PAR  Clean restaurant/ fast service/ standard menu/   Had better"}
{"text":"We love Pho and always up to trying a new place. We will not be back.  We asked about a seafood pho & they only had shrimp pho, no thanks.  There was no tofu what so ever on the menu.  A bit unusual for an Asian restaurant we thought.  My sweetie will always have a banh mi, again disappointed.  On the plus side, the restaurant was clean & decor was nice."}
{"text":"Yummy, fresh, good prices, friendly service. Great for takeout. Love their pho, spring rolls, egg rolls, and bun. They have ruined me for spring rolls from anywhere else, dammit. I think they put crack in them or something"}
{"text":"Good, quick option in downtown phoenix. We dined here before a Suns game and we got in and out with great service and delicious food in under 45 minutes. The Pho was very good, as was the noodle dish I ordered."}
{"text":"We got started with a flat Diet Coke, warmed up with incredibly bland spring rolls, and then walked out after one bite of a terrible Bahn Mi. The sandwich meat was cold, gray, and indistinguishable.   Service was nice, though. The server was polite and willing to remove the sandwiches and flat soda from the bill."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Pho so I scoured yelp until I found one close to me with good reviews. Holy cow, this totally hit the spot! The broth was flavorful. The meatballs delicious and the sides were a good proportion.  Loved my soup. The egg rolls were not the best, but it's okay I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm. . .get the Pho!  My friend and I went here for dinner.  We each ordered the Pho with rare steak and extra vegetables.  It was the best Pho I have EVER had!  It was also HUGE!  I was unable to finish it and lefts so extremely stuffed.  Can't wait to go back and try other entrees!"}
{"text":"I go to Viet Kitchen on a regular basis. I only get the Pho but it is super delicious. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I used to live on 7th St. and Greenway and was searching for someplace nearby to eat some Pho.  One day I was driving and happened to notice this place, so I decided to stop on it and try it out.  I always order my usual, Pho Tai, Iced Condensed Coffee, and Spring Rolls.  Immediately upon walking in I was surprised by the decor.  It seemed very clean and updated compared to some of the other places I have eaten Vietnamese food from.  The wait staff was extremely friendly and catered to my every need.  The food came quickly and was hot and fresh.  I was slightly disappointed in the broth of the soup, I guess I was expecting a little more flavor, and the overall size of the bowl in comparison to other joints.  In either case, it was still delicious.  They even offered me more broth when I sucked all mine up!  I continued to go back to this location because the wait staff was amazing.  After the second time I came in, they always knew my order and didn't even bother to ask me what I wanted.  They even remembered small details like the fact that I love mint in my water.  The only reason I have chosen not to give this place 5 stars is because I feel that for the price of the soup you should get a larger bowl.  I have paid much less for much more substance, equal in taste and quality.  In either case, good place on the north side to try out!"}
{"text":"Favorite Pho!  They have great vegetarian options.  Pho and everything else is always great."}
{"text":"broth is too salty.  beef in pho not always fresh.  spring rolls are not very fresh. i've eaten here 10xs. go to tea light if u live in north phoenix.  i've given up on this place."}
{"text":"Soooooooo good. Very clean inside and very polite. They're food is just simply incredible!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I always order their bun bo hue and they are the bomb. Meat always fresh no smell to it. Very generous with their meat. I wish they use bigger noddles instead of skinny noddle for bun bo hue. We come here almost every weekend. Waiter are very nice and friendly. Food comes out pretty fast too. Love this place. Best of luck to them and many years more serving us"}
{"text":"Started coming here a while back ago and loved it! Viet Kitchen has very good tasting pho in which I am referring to the Saigon Pho that I always order! I also enjoy their many other dishes such as the Chicken & Green- one of my favorite. In addition the service is awesome. They are always so friendly to us and actually talk to us unlike other restaurants! This is a place to go to. Highly recommended! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place was okay.  I had the pho tai and it came with the usual array of bean sprouts/thai basil/etc.  they have Pepsi products for which I deduct a star...Star two was deducted by just having okay food.  Granted, I just had pho, but that should rope me in like a rodeo calf, guess those spots in Hawaii I visited spoiled me as I've not found anything even close back here at home."}
{"text":"This place is closed.  It is now Thai Basil.  We drove all the way to downtown to discover it no longer existed.  I should have called first."}
{"text":"Great place to go to when you have a head cold and need some extra Spicy Soup. The menu here has most of the favorites you would see at your typical Viet Restaurant. It is hard to find many noodle restaurants up in this part of town.  Inside is very simple with some really funky tables and chairs. Reminded me of playing with my Rubik's cube as a kid. It was a struggle just to get my legs underneath the table. Hmmm?   Ordered the Spring Rolls and what most places call the #1. Here their Beef Pho with everything is called the #3a or Pho Saigon. These are a couple of my standards for judging and it will give you a good gauge of what you can expect.  The Spring Rolls came out first and seemed a little soggy and tasted very bland. It looked like there was some type of roasted meat in there. Funny the menu did not mention anything about pork or beef. The XL Beef Pho was actually pretty good. The broth had a nice flavor and was not too sweet or salty. The beef tendons and tripe were cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth.  Service was mediocre and they did not offer much enthusiasm. Place got really busy fast and it was completely full when I was leaving. No joke!  Located right next to that mad house called Costco. Give them a try and see what you think. NE PHX WOOT!  3.25 STARS"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of thai or viet food, however this place is amazing, everything is so fresh and tasty, i went in yesterday and got the beef vermicelli  & spring rolls & it was amazing, so TODAY i went in and got the grilled chicken Verma and it was also great, had so much deep taste!!! great service, great food & wash it down with some of their heavy thai tea! what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"Saw the sign out front for like three months (seemed like it) before they opened and finally tonight we got a chance to try them out.    If you've not had Vietnamese food before, think fresh elements like basil leaves to pinch off the stalk, plump bean sprouts and stuff like that.  neat approach to adding as much, or as little spice and flavor as you want.  The decor was OK - imported wood benches, chairs and tables with a glass top easy to wipe down quickly.   The wait staff promptly greeted us and we were shown to table #8.  Our waitress, Jennifer retrieved our drinks, water with a little lime slice in it.   The menu was presented and it was an adventure too.  The inside front was in Vietnamese and it was translated in English on the inside back - no big whup, I know, but kinda fun.  We had Vietnamese food before, visiting anther restaurant with our friends, one of whom grew up in Cambodia but not being a regular, we were just a bit unsure - not only of what to select, but how to pronounce the dishes we saw in the menu - the waitress, Jennifer, was very patient and coached us through the effort.  We ended up with an appetizer and two different entree, knowing that it was way more food than we wanted, but we did want to try new dishes and get a sense of the kitchen.  The first dish to arrive was Pho Ga, basically a chicken soup with long noodles.  It's served with fresh bean sprouts, basil, jalapeno slices and a lime wedge.  Once it arrives at your table, you're supposed to add the fresh ingredients and then dive in - the fresh with the broth, chicken and noodles is a great meal.  We added Hoisin Sauce and it added just a touch of sweet.  The next dish was Bun Bo Dac Biet, a spicy pork noodle soup.  The noodles are a bit larger and the fresh elements included the basil, bean sprouts and banana flowers, or at least part of a banana flower.  I added a bit more chili paste to really drive up the heat factor, but hey, that's how I roll ya know.  The final dish served was our appetizer, Banh Xeo.  This was a referred to as a Vietnamese pancake, but a savory egg pancake with shrimp, bean sprouts and supposed to be ripped apart and served on a lettuce leaf with a sweet & spicy sauce.  The ripping apart was facilitated when they handed us a pair of kitchen shears and we cut the Bahn Xeo into pieces and assembled them on a lettuce leaf and spooned the spicy sauce.  Really yum...  The place was not anywhere near full when we arrived, but traffic was steady for takeout and several more people came in for dining.  We got to meet Nancy, the other waitress and Jennie, the owner and manager.  jennie was really happy to hear how much we enjoyed our meal.  When we told her I had tweeted it out to 1,700 of my fiends, she encouraged us to let her know in advance and that she had some 'special dishes' she'd like to share with us - we promised to return soon!  We ranked it 4 out of 5 stars because a few of the basil leaves we're discolored, but we did not feel like it affected the quality nor the flavors we enjoyed.  We're really happy to see Viet Kitchen open in the neighborhood and expect to become regulars."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed when we walked in is that the restaurant is very clean, which is always a relief when walking into a more hole in the wall establishment. My boyfriend and I both got the pho tai which was great!  It was hot, the ingredients were fresh, and I always love the presentation of pho.  He lives down the street and there aren't too many places to eat in the area so it's nice to find a go to restaurant close by.  Overall: Clean, fresh food, good service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for their viet Iced coffees. This thing packs a punch. I heard a lot about them from my coworker. We are both getting things done!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I dine here at least once a week. The service, food quality, and price will always keep us coming back for more.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I like this place. I always get the same thing, Beef Pho and I am never disappointed. The service is always speedy and the folks that work there are very nice."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the Phoenix area! The food is great and the service makes it the kind of place where you can easily become a regular. It has all the charms of an authentic little hole-in-the wall with all the authentic tastes, but the ambience is much nicer."}
{"text":"Had the beef pho and it was delish! They even added extra beef meatballs. The Thai tea with soy milk was also one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"The food here is comparable to, or slightly better than, that found in most Vietnamese restaurants in the city. Most of the Vietnamese restaurants I've tried serve really tasty fare and this is no exception. But while most Vietnamese restaurants in the area are found in nondescript or decrepit strip malls, this one is found in a very well maintained, newer commercial area that is easily accessible, as this is near Loop 101 near the ramps to and from Cave Creek Rd. The restaurant itself has a fancier atmosphere than most Vietnamese dining establishments, with ornate wooden chairs and contemporary Asian decor - so much so that when you see the restaurant interior for the first time, you'd expect the food to be pricey. A glance at the menu, though, reveals a delightful surprise - the items as just as inexpensive as those in the much less fancily-appointed Vietnamese eateries in the not-so-pleasant locations."}
{"text":"Bummer update. One of the things that made this a worthwhile Vietnamese restaurant besides the close proximity was the service. I had probably gone here once a week for a while and was a definite regular. I've now updated my review with two stars based solely on the food alone. There aren't that many Vietnamese restaurants that are California caliber in AZ and I always appreciated that Viet Kitchen at least had great service. The last time I was there, though, I had come 30-45 minutes before close and I was greeted with a rude \"we are closing soon\" so I just turned around and walked out and haven't been back since. I'm bummed. Maybe one day I'll go back but that quite frankly shocked me since they were typically so nice and we are such frequent diners. They may have lost a long term frequent diner forever."}
{"text":"Some of the best pho in town. Stumbled upon this place based on a recommendation and have found few places that have better pho. Staff is always very welcoming. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One order of spring rolls, one grilled pork and pate banh mi (or, as the menu puts it: Vietnamese French style sandwich) and one cafe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee, drip style with sweetened condensed milk).  This is my typical lunch fare when going to a Vietnamese place for lunch, and I made no exception with Viet Kitchen.  I agree with Norm R. This place is much nicer than most of the Vietnamese places I frequent. Real attention was paid to decor - there's nothing \"ethnic dive\" about this place. Where I disagree with Norm is on price - I found prices to be notably higher than the dives I frequent. $3.75 for the two spring rolls - they're $2.25 at my \"normal\" haunt. $4.99 for the banh mi, compared to $2.50 where I usually go. Still cheap for the amount and quality of food - but knowing how much less I could be paying for the same quality and portion size does make me feel I am paying for the decor - which is not why I decided on Viet Kitchen...I went there for the food, not the \"pretty.\"  The food was A-OK - not the most amazing versions of the dishes I ordered, but nothing wrong with them. Everything had the freshness and flavor profiles I was expecting - this is one of my comfort food meals - and it did the job I needed it to do.  My stepfather is going to be moving to this area soon - and I may well stop in while headed to or from his place - but I don't think I'd ever drive out of my way to eat here. Not when I can get similar quality for less cash far closer to where I work and live."}
{"text":"Love the food here. As someone who was married to a viet I know authentic and good quality. The place is very clean and friendly staff. The green papaya salad was the best I've had. The pho broth was clean and had great flavor as well as the vegetarian broth. I will most definitely be back to viet kitchen"}
{"text":"Viet Kitchen is not for vegetarians. The food don't taste good, kitchen is not clean, service is bad, when you enter the restaurant before half an hour of the closing time, the waitress may yell at you and say they are cleaning the kitchen.  Seeing the reviews here, I think the restaurant may have some non vegetarian dishes which are good yet the kitchen IS very dirty.  I will never go to Viet Kitchen."}
{"text":"I've had Viet Kitchen twice now. All in all, I'd call it average, not bad, but not exceptional either. The Pho was good, but I've had better in the city. Their fried egg rolls are delicious, which is a plus in their favor. I had their Banh Mi sandwich and one of their appetizers, Banh Beo. The Banh Mi had a great flavor, but they skimped majorly on the vegetables, which to me are what makes the sandwich, it helps balance the density of the pate. I'm talking one tiny slice of pickled cucumber per sandwich half. I've had Banh Mi elsewhere and they're packed with the veggies. This sandwich seemed to be mostly bread, there was no balance to the different aspects. The Banh Beo didn't come in a tiny dish like it does usually (everywhere I've had them they come in a dish, it might now be like that everywhere, but in my experience they're in a dish), which made them hard to eat as they just sat on the plate and fell apart when you tried to pick them up (I went full American and ate with a fork because I couldn't pick them up), and they tasted OK but there was a flavor I couldn't identify (ginger maybe, but not quite that) that nearly overpowered my taste buds. Plus the shrimp/pork topping was a mushy puree, with no texture.  So all in all, I'd say average. Good enough if I'm desperately craving Pho, but not my fave in town."}
{"text":"Came in at 8:30pm when their kitchen closes at 9pm with several tables in the restaurant and was told we could only order togo. Our food came up by 8:40 and we live far so we asked if we could eat some there and we were given a prompt no because the restaurant was closing down. There were 3 other tables still eating. Very rude."}
{"text":"Yelp scored again. Thanks to everyone and their reviews.  I was hungry, but for something light. I decided on Pho. Searched for Pho in my zip code and this was the first place that came up. Read the reviews and decided to go. Inside it was clean and inviting. The staff was very friendly. I ordered to-go.  Pho Nam, Spring Rolls and Summer Rolls...not to adventurous. My order was quickly prepared and off I went.  Everything was very good. The broth had actual flavor, not just a clear broth. Ample additions such as the bean sprouts, Thai basil, jalapenos, cilantro, a wedge of lime, peanut sauce, garlic chili sauce, hoisin, sirachi and a vinegar/fish sauce (?) all came with it.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Their Pho is so good. My daughter and I had the Saigon Pho, they are pho-nominal. The spring rolls and fresh rolls were excellent.  The staff was so great, food came out quick and perfect."}
{"text":"Used to live very close to Viet Kitchen and had to move away for work... I am currently at my third Vietnamese restaurant in Beverly Hills, and so far have been gravely disappointed each time...I have yet to taste Pho as wonderful as Viet Kitchen's. Their house special Pho always hits the spot!!"}
{"text":"Really good banh mi sandwiches. Pork and pate'  Sping rolls very nice. Vermicelli is next on my list to try."}
{"text":"You wouldn't even know it's open from the outside, but once you walk in the words, it's like a tavern-- a friendly, upscale, not too noisy one."}
{"text":"I can only give this place an OK because that's just what I have had from them so far- food that was ok, not slap your grandma good! The menu is kind of hard to understand but I know that I like chicken pho so I ordered that the first go-round and just wasn't wowed like I wanted to be. The noodles were good but the broth just wasnt to my liking. The second time I had pork noodles (dry) and it was better but still not GOOD. JD had the spicy noodle soup and that was good too, but , again, you guessed it-OK. I haven't given up on it yet because it is so close to my house and the people are so nice and friendly.  Any suggestions on what to order won't be ignored."}
{"text":"Love visiting Viet Kitchen! Food is amazing and everything was perfect tonight. Stir fry and grilled plates are to die for. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best pho I've had. The love is in the broth, rich and fragrant. Pho phans, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in by myself for lunch. The place is nice inside, but the back door was open and the whole restaurant smelled from the employees smoking by the back door. Service was adequate.  I had the chicken noodle Pho, which was serviceable. It came with a plate of the typical garnish, and there was the usual Siracha, fish sauce, and such on the table already.  I will give them another try, but with some friends."}
{"text":"We come here before or after our trips to Costco all of the time! Also great takeout.  Service isn't always on point, but hey, it's a Vietnamese restaurant so I don't expect much.  Some of the better pho in the Valley and also a tasty Banh Mi sandwich!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  Didn't get get my order right and no apology. I sat there waiting and finally when i asked about my order I just get the, \"Oh. You want pho?\"  So, did I just want to say my order out loud so I can listen to myself talk?"}
{"text":"I found this place while yelping for a vietnamese place to eat. We saw the amazing five stars but by only 4 reviews so we were kind of iffy on if we should try it or not. Let's just say I'm go glad we gave this new place a try! They definitely serve some authentic vietnamese dishes. Like a previous reviewer said this place doesnt serve the typical pho. They serve everything else but pho. From dishes like snails to goat. Lovely flavors. Super authentic. Saw a big cockroach on the ground roaming the place. Scared the crap out of me. Still loved the food though. Lol"}
{"text":"This place is definitely 5 stars. The service, the smiles at the counter, the flavor of the food, the easiness when ordering take out, the variety of the menu. It is the best Vietnamese of the neighborhood. But the star off is because of the excessive price of their Thai tea. Nearly $6 after tax is a bit exaggerated. They need to make it more affordable. Specially for people like me that is never happy with just one."}
{"text":"Love Viet Kitchen.  Excellent Vietnamese Pho & noodle dishes.  Been there 15 times in the last 2 years. Great fresh food at great prices.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Cons: 1. The chairs are hard and they will mess up the back of your heels if you're wearing sandals. 2. The online menu is way more extensive than the actual menu, it felt a bit misleading  Pros: 1. The food is delicious! The lemongrass with beef is absolutely delectable with just the right amount the heat and the shrimp spring rolls were incredibly fresh.  2. The service is quick.  I will go back just as soon as I can."}
{"text":"Delicious pho. Tasty drinks and good service... what else do u need. Me and my wife come here once a month.."}
{"text":"I was craving Pho in the middle of the summer, and decided to try this place out. They have many of the same traditional dishes that other Vietnamese restaurants have around the valley, but their menu is a bit smaller.  Aesthetically speaking, this is one of the more nice looking Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix. Very well-thought-out décor from the walls to their plates. Service was excellent and very attentive to our needs. In regards to the food, I ordered vermicelli, pho, spring rolls, and cha goi (egg rolls). Everything was served hot and fresh. I came with a group of friends, and there were no complaints, but silence when we were all eating. The only concern I had was that their pho and egg roll garnish plate wasn't the best. I know its the least important thing I should be worried about, but compared to other restaurants, the leafy greens looked tired and fading.    Besides that, I will be likely coming back for a second round. :)"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant, this place just is not good and we love Vietnamese food. Nothing tasted fresh at all. We started with spring rolls that tasted like they must have been prepped earlier in the week (it was a Sunday). To top that off, I ordered a Diet Coke that was completely flat.   Of course not going to rate a restaurant off of a flat soda, I just set that to the side and waited for our bahn mi to come out. It was not just the worst bahn mi I had ever had, but the worst sandwich I have ever had. Neither my girlfriend nor I could get through more than one bite. I've never in my life been so grossed out by something that I couldn't finish it or even just ask for a different dish. The pork was practically gray in color and oddly perfectly rectangular in shape. It tasted like it also had been sitting in the fridge for the entire week and was served to us cold. While the spring roles were at least edible, the bahn mi was not even palatable.   Credit to the server, we politely asked if we could just pay for the spring rolls and leave. She was very apologetic and offered to get us different dishes but we just couldn't stomach trying anything else there after seeing and tasting the \"pork\" on the sandwich.   Perhaps the noodle dishes here are great, but as bahn mi lovers we have to give this one star."}
{"text":"This place is much nicer inside than the down town Vietnamese places I am used to. But you still need to walk through their party to use the rest room.  The menu has many of the usual suspects. For Veg options they have sprig-rolls, a few tofu stir-frys and a noodle soup.  For all three items my wife and I tried the flavors were lacking, my stir fry tasted mostly of soy, the spring rolls lacked the herbs they should have and her soup was uninspired.   Other than being not your usual asian food for most, this place is nothing special."}
{"text":"The 3.5 star rating on this place is crazy.  I see other Pho places near by with 4 star ratings and I've tried them, and was not impressed at all.  Their special with the tendon, tripe, rare beef, and brisket is by far the best in the valley, and its all a convenient 10-15 minute drive from where I live. They also do a crepe omelette thing which I really love too.  Pho is one of my favorite foods, and this place does it right.  Their egg rolls and pork fried rice are also excellent.  If anyone is second guessing themselves because of the 3.5 stars, DON'T."}
{"text":"I got the Banh Mi, spring rolls, and vermicelli with pork dish. The meat was dry and overall food wasn't all that great. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I finally made it over to the Viet Kitchen.  Each time I go by it at lunch there is either a group dining and taking up most of the room, or a line.  I figured Tuesday is usually a lull in dining so I would give it a shot.  I ordered the Pho (soup with beef brisket).  It was done in a traditional style with rice noodles and beef in broth and bean sprouts, jalapeno and basil to add to taste.    The food was good, not exceptional.   I would have liked a larger portion than received, but based on taste alone I was satisfied.  The food is delivered in about five to ten minutes so there is no unexpected wait.   The menu appeared to have a number of options, but when I viewed it closer, most of the soups and rolls were similar to one another sans a one of two ingredient difference.  The wait staff is good.  My water was kept full and my check was not rushed.  The urban atmosphere is unique for Phoenix.  It was exciting watching the traffic, seeing big building, people walking and a light rail train pass by.  It did not feel like Phoenix.  The view alone made it interesting.  For a lunch with tip for about $10.00, I must say I enjoyed it.  Something was missing.  It was good, but not outstanding."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pho Saigon.  Great price, clean and fast service."}
{"text":"have yet to dine in but we've gotten takeout more than once and are always super pleased."}
{"text":"We went over for dinner- had the spring rolls, chicken curry, and lemongrass chicken. The spring rolls and lemongrass chicken were about a 3 star, but the chicken curry was really good and made up for the others. We also had the coconut water, which was fresh. Prices were reasonable we paid around $30."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food. Ordered the chicken salad, the chicken was rubbery and they put way too much sesame oil. Pho was underwhelming, not very flavorable. Even the Soda tasted flat. Customer service although not rude, terrible service. I asked for plates for a table of three and I got one plate. I asked for extra napkins as I had my child with me, and they brought literally one napkin. I asked for more water and they refilled only my cup not the other cup that was almost empty."}
{"text":"Since my last visit they got rid of the uncomfortable but pretty chairs and replaced them with comfortable cushioned chairs that are slightly too wide to fit the tables.  We started with Summer Rolls. They were much larger than I was expecting and also far more delicious than I was expecting. The beef inside had this delicious charcoal kind of taste and had very fresh vegetables around it in a rice paper wrapper. The fresh mint inside made it very refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day. The roll was also served with a light fish sauce.  I had the Spicy Stir-Fry. It wasn't as spicy as I was expecting but it had a nice kick to it. The white meat chicken was developed with flavors and was prepared very well. This dish had a wide assortment of fresh crunchy vegetables in it that was covered in a very balanced sauce. This WAS A VERY GOOD Dish and possibly one of the best dishes you can get anywhere for $7.25.  Out of all my visits so far I haven't been disappointed with anything I ordered from here.   I like that they offer many different things that I don't notice at other Vietnamese Restaurants.  The food seems very solid from here."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I crave pho. Today I ordered the fried spring rolls. I thought the would be small, but I was wrong!  They were so good I ate all three. They were right out of the fryer and not greasy at all. Just lots of crispy goodness with a yummy sauce for dipping. I also had the rare steak/brisket pho. Comes with fresh veggies to throw in as you please. Control the heat with the fresh sliced peppers.   The service is fast and friendly. It is not a fancy place, but pleasantly decorated. Come for the food. If you are like me you will be back again and again."}
{"text":"My family frequents this restaurant. Why? Because EVERY time the food is quick, fresh and hot and delicious, the staff are friendly-remember my name- owner is sweet and very professional. My husband orders the pho every time, I like to try new things I love the array of items. Our littlest one 5 devours the spring rolls like nobodies business! GO eat here, enjoy the atmosphere and step outside the boring box, you'll be so glad you did!!"}
{"text":"Worst pho ever! Super greasy broth and you are expected to pay for your pho after you return it after eating one spoonful of greasy broth. Also, my daughters stir fry dish was spilled on her lap when being served. Nothing was credited for that disaster either. The owner said next time I would need to tell the kitchen workers how I would like my pho prepared . What the heck does that even mean!! There won't be a next time . Greasy pho broth , terrible owner attitude"}
{"text":"Used to come here for lunch every once in a while but now I WILL NEVER be coming back!  I ordered the pho with the beef and extra noodle. My friend just ordered the beef and meatball pho as is.  They ended up putting the extra noodles in my friend's pho so when I asked the waitress if she could fix it, you know what she said?!? Are you ready for this?!?!  She said, and I QUOTE \"Maybe your friend can share noodle with you...\"  Are you F**KING kidding me lady?!?! Really????  I was DONE after that. Never going back. I'm still shocked she even said that to us........"}
{"text":"This is a great place for the classic Vietnamese soups. Although don't stop at soup go ahead and get an awesome salad. If it's summer you will enjoy a refreshing salad and boba drink.  Also good service.  This place would get the 5 stars if the news was not on the TV. Music would be a star maker for the dinning experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I was so sad when I moved away. The Pho Tai (rare beef) is amazing."}
{"text":"For the Pho-friendly, new-to-Pho, and old-Pho folks, this Cen-Pho girl is all about Viet Kitchen's Oh So Fabulous Pho!!      Ok, enough Pho-isms...  :-) on to the review:   A friend pointed this place out en route to a hockey game one time, so we decided to check it out a few weeks later.   Of course, I looked up the Yelp reviews before going and honestly, was pretty leary- for a totally ridiculous reason that so many reviews said the chairs are really uncomfortable.  What?!?!   My partner convinced me that was not reason enough to forego checking this place out, so reluctantly I went...    Happily, the chairs are FINE, people!   I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I surely preferred their nice, beautifully lacquered low armless chairs to crappy uncomfortable white plastic armchair patio furniture that is found at a lot of restaurants.  Bizarre that so many have commented  (and yes, I realize I'm also commenting on the chairs rather than the food, but I want people to know the chairs are just fine!!)    My only thought is that they have updated the chairs since those reviews, but based on the review dates it seems not?  Clearly a difference in opinion here, but the chairs are seriously FINE!   Now that nonsense is out of the way, let's talk food.   Pho, to be exact.  Yum, yum, yummy!!   That Pho is pho' real, pho' sho'!   :-)    I tried the chicken pho and my partner had the house and we both were happy campers.   My family has Pho for Christmas every year, and restaurant pho usually doesn't compare to the homemade stuff in my book.   But...I'd say Viet Kitchen does a great job!   The flavors are complex and savory, the meat was tender, and the smells intoxicating.    So, in summary... chairs are fine, pho is fab and I'm not phoking around!!  hehe      Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times this year. This is not exactly my favorite Vietnamese restaurant, but the location is convenient and it is kind of growing on me. Hubby finally found a favorite, the spicy beef, although it does not have enough protein in my opinion, very skimpy with the beef. The pho is good, and I like that since I do not get noodles with my pho, they usually offer vegetables free of charge. Service is OK, but not very warm. Last time we had the coconut (coconut water in the whole coconut) and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Not a friendly place.  They give you weird looks for coming in to order food.  It was about 30 minutes after opening hour but not one customer was in sight.  Not a single soul except for myself.  They seem anti-social.  Give you dirty looks just for placing an order.  I ordered Pho Tai Gan (Pho with Rare Beef and Tendon).  It was okay.  Nothing special.  It was definitely not good.  I couldn't finish it and only managed to eat half.  Don't understand the rave reviews.  I guess I have different standards than most people because I was raised by a Chef."}
{"text":"Are go to for Pho in the neighborhood. Good service. We always get the chicken soup and egg rolls. Mix it up with the spring rolls. Clean"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I received the wrong dish which was supposed to be fried rice with chicken, instead it was a side of what looked like dried out roadkill with a pile of steamed rice. The woman at the counter said I ordered wrong. Won't go back."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Vietnamese I've had in the valley.  The Pho was amazing - every ingredient had flavor, and the broth just kept getting better with each slurp.  The vegetarian spring rolls were light, not chewy, perfect.  The egg rolls were rich, just a little spicy, and very fresh.  We literally only had one complaint: the food items came out at all different times. It was all so fresh and good that we didn't care, but I'm sure someone will.  Really good. Really worth it. Yum.  Pictures to follow."}
{"text":"Well...I'm super excited that there is finally, finally some V-food in downtown Phoenix.  The more ethnic cuisine around the better.  It is in a convenient location on 1st and Adams.  The kitchen area is open to the public (a first I think I've ever seen).  I ordered take out and everything I needed was in there.  The plus, fast service.  The minus, I felt like things were not quite as tasty as some of my other standbyes.  The prices also reflect the snazzy downtown locale, a dinner for two came out to be closer to 30 bucks (which is still a bargain) but I'm used to about 15-20 at the divier joints.  I'm still going to support them when I'm in a pinch for takeout or lunch downtown, but if I'm craving the authentic and frenetic pace of a Vietnamese eatery I'll have to head out to the avenue's for some of the more established dives. Didn't have the bahn mi (they were out).  Had a standard buhn dice which was nice but i'm used to the nom plah a little sweeter with more garlic.  The egg rolls are good, (not filled with just veggies).  The spring rolls are missing my favorite, shrimp!  The omlette dish is an acquired taste, and I'll leave it at that :)"}
{"text":"Great pho!! Great price to portion!!  If I have one complaint it's the TINY TABLES..."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at this place. The dining area is pretty quiet, which is nice after a long day of work and the service is quick and efficient. My favorite meal is the house stir-fry with egg noodles and beef. I recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Vietnamese food especially pho, which is basically the only thing I eat when I have Vietnamese food. Their soup is so good!! It has amazing flavor I get their veggie soup with extra noodles and they always give me extra noodles. The don't get mad if you ask. This service is great and quick and the ladies who own The restaurant are so sweet and nice. You can also call in an order and pick it up which is great. Overall this place is a for sure five stars and I will of course come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in North Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Conveniently located near the Loop101 Freeway and Cave Creek Rd, good access from anywhere.  I come here for lunch when I want comfort food. Something good for my tummy.  Service is on and off sometimes. They do get really busy between 11:30am-12:30pm. Normally wait is 5 mins.  I try to come before 11:30am and usually get seated immediately. We came around 11:45am today and had to wait about 5 mins. It just feel longer than 5 mins when you are waiting.  I like to start with Thai Tea or iced Vietnamese coffee. Just right amount of sweetness to both of the drinks, I enjoy their strong caffeine. It helps me stay awake in the afternoon on the day like today.  I also like to order their house fried rice. I think it was called Viet fried rice.  They look spicy from the color of the food, but actually not spicy at all.  It taste very much like fried rice you will get at a Chinese restaurant in Japan. Sometimes, I come here just to eat fried rice (comes with shrimp, beef, chicken and pork meat).  I like their rice dish and summer rolls, spring rolls.... pretty much everything on the menu I tried have been good so far.  I think I could eat here everyday for about a week?  Hmmm I should try that someday to see how many days in a row I can eat?  So why this place is my favorite? I think it is their broth. Their broth, as often as I eat, I still don't get tired of it."}
{"text":"Food quality has gone way down!!!  I used to come here frequently and really liked the Pho.  Unfortunately, the last two times I went the food was awful!  The meat quality was really poor.  The taste was not the same.  There was a lot of fat.  One time the meat looked weird, maybe overcooked, and I felt ill after eating.  I gave the place one more shot and it was still bad.  I won't be back until I know the quality is back to what it used to be.  :("}
{"text":"Average Vietnamese restaurant. Their pho broth was a little bland and their fish sauce for the vermicelli dishes were completely bland. It didn't even taste like fish sauce at all. I understand it's probably because Americans don't like the fishy taste so it's to cater to them."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Vietnamese food. The food was amazing and the restaurant was very clean. The service was awesome! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure. It's better in house but pretty good for take out too, clean restaurant and they keep it very cool which is nice for hot Pho. Good prices and right off the 101 and  cave creek.   Whenever you ask other vitnamease where to eat they send you here. I haven't had a bad experience.    Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Man did THIS PLACE hit the spot!!  My husband and I were in Phoenix on a fact-finding trip (considering relocation) and part of my prerequisites is that I can find all my comfort food locally. My review could be slightly biased because I was STARVING TO DEATH...I had been sick (think vomit in the rental car) earlier that day and my husband was so freaked out that he refused to let me eat! What kinda shit is THAT? (O_o)  Anyway, I was afraid to eat anything heavy and what else better to eat when you're stomach is feelin crazy but PHO? Oh how I love Yelp on my phone...so I looked up local Pho spots and this place was the closest to our hotel. It was a bit difficult to find (for us since we're not from there) and I had to call...seems we were parked on the side of the physical address...who knew the door was around the corner?  The place was DEAD EMPTY - but I wasn't all that surprised...it was a Saturday afternoon and the downtown area doesn't really scream out EXCITEMENT after 5pm on Friday. I love the open kitchen idea...wish we had more places like that in LA. The service was prompt (because let's face it, they were probably happy to see some business). I ordered my usual Pho fare...rare steak and got my husband the combination of EVERYTHING. It totally hit the spot. I managed to scarf down the entire bowl. Of course, like I said...I was starving, so anything probably would've been good around that time.  No complaints...except the bathroom was HELLA hard to find..."}
{"text":"This was our first time in....the service and food were both rather bland. It's unfortunate because I really hoped for better.  I ordered the bbq & roll vermicelli and he ordered the house stir fry with rice noodles, we shared an order of egg rolls.  The egg rolls were good,  the entrées we lackluster."}
{"text":"They make amazing Pho soup! I've been going for four years and the only other dishes I've tried is there stir fry & spring rolls. All very delicious and consistent! Its a low key place with delicious food. Get past the ambiance and enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"The best pho in town, and I've tried a lot of places.  Service is also fast & friendly.  Prices are what you'd expect.  Haven't tried other dishes because the pho is so good.  I have to limit my visits to once a week, or I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho Chik soup. Great broth flavor and good value."}
{"text":"Thought we would give this place a try in our new neighborhood. Started with spring rolls that were uneatable-the meat tasted rancid and was an off color. Our entrees (beef filet pieces & rice) was just okay. The rice was my favorite part of the whole meal, but it's kind of hard to mess up steamed rice. My partner had the mixed grill (beef, chicken, shrimp) stir fry noodles. It was okay other than very fishy-tasting shrimp. The worst part of our dining experience was our waitress standing behind the counter wiping & picking her nose with her hand and not washing them after!!"}
{"text":"Dismal. I didn't even get to place my order.  I wasn't  even offered water. Terrible,  no concept of service. The lady in charge seems not to want patrons coming in. If you want to be treated like crap and pay, then come"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Holy cow I can't believe I worked next to this place for so long without coming in! Amazing food! I also like the decor. It's very simple yet elegant. I normally just go with the spicy way, one of their specialties and it is one of the best soups I've had the privilege to enjoy. House stir fry is also a good choice."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now and I've not had one bad experience. The pho is always good, always tastes fresh. My favorite is the one with all the fixings with meatballs, tripe and steak. They have an XL version of any pho for $1.50 more   I love both their fried and fresh spring rolls. I get one or the other every time.   Always friendly staff even when I once had a group of 8, which they easily and happily accommodated. Overall great and probably the best pho place in northern PHX area. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sunday late evening dinner was tasty.  I arrived only 15 minutes before closing and the staff was very friendly.  As usual there are a couple of dishes that are the measuring stick for specific ethnic restaurants.  For Vietnamese it is spring rolls, pho and clay pots.  I had the pho and the spring rolls.  Spring rolls were excellent, light with fresh shrimp, tasty pork and fresh ingredients.  The Pho was excellent.  I had the rare filet which was perfectly cooked.  There was a light flavor of cinnamon in my pho.  I typically do not like the taste of cinnamon.  Wtih that said I will be trying one of the clay pots next time I visit!"}
{"text":"On entry, you see a Buddha statue and a room divider. You go around and are almost always immediately greeted by one of the employees here. They sit you down at a table with the usual Pho service station, including spoons and chopsticks. The menu is also about what you would expect from a Pho locale, a few pictures of spring rolls, their soups, and their prices for dishes, all noted by numbers.  The Service: The service is good. They do take care of you, ensuring your drinks are filled and your food arrives promptly. This said, the reason Viet Kitchen gets one less star than five is a personal experience I had.  I walked in fifteen minutes from their posted closing time and there were a few customers about. The staff came up to me and told me that their kitchen was closed that night. This irked me, as I have a long history of food service experience. If your door says you are open to a certain hour, you are open until that hour (Insert 'Waiting' scene where the cooks throw food in the air in frustration). I don't expect everyone to be frustrated from this, as most humans operate during normal business operation hours, but for a nighthawk like me, it's tough to meet the hours.  The food: The food was great. There is another Pho place I go because it's hours are more amicable to me, however the broth at this place is better. I would say it's one of the best in North Phoenix.  Recommend it? Yes. I've been here several times since the early closing incident. The food is great. I just don't bother going there if it's remotely close to closing time for them."}
{"text":"So glad this placed opened up near my house!  This was my first visit, the place was fairly busy for a new restaurant.  It's hard to find good Asian food in AZ!  I had the Vietnamese egg rolls & grilled beef with rice noodle dish.  It was really good.  It's a big bowl of noodles with well seasoned beef, an egg roll cut in thirds, and a side of yummy fish sauce to pour over and stir up.  It's not soup, so if you try it don't expect a lot of broth.  I am going to try to Pho Tai next time!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered Pho this year and ever since I have been trying to find the most authentic Pho that one would be able to get here in Phoenix. Out of all the places I have tried, Viet Kitchen is the one with a flavorful broth. The whole restaurant smells of star anise and all the other spices that goes into the broth. If you are not used to these flavors, it can be a bit over powering, which was the case for my boyfriend. He enjoys Pho Thanh's Pho, which he says is a bit bland but saltier than the one we tried.  So, if you have the taste buds for authentically made broth, I'd recommend trying it at least once. :)  PS  As for the location, it is easy to find and the inside is a bit small. The decor is comforting but I found it confusing when it came to being seated. There was not anyone at the door to greet us and I wasn't sure if it was a Seat Yourself kind of place but after walking to the bar and asking, I find out we needed to wait to be seated. The only downer is that they do not serve water once seated. It took about 10 minutes of waiting before we finally received our waters. Other than that, I plan on coming here for the days I get to choose the Pho, as for my boyfriend, he'll most likely be sticking to Pho Thanh (17th Ave & Camelback)."}
{"text":"We come here often and love the place. My wife is from South East Asia so we don't go for Americanized versions of Asian food. This place is pretty close to authentic. Typical we get the beef pho but this last time I got the vermicelli with grilled pork and egg rolls. My number two choice for this restaurant. Also, their Vietnamese iced coffee is yummy!  Overall it's clean, service prompt and food is good."}
{"text":"A nice, clean and quiet environment.  The only complaint about the surroundings being some strong incense near the counter, so we moved to the other side of the restaurant and it was fine.  Was excited to see coconut juice on the menu, so we ordered two.  We were surprised when the waitress came out of the kitchen with a couple of coconuts freshly chopped of their skin to an attractive shape.  They were fresh young coconuts without much meat, so they were loaded with awesome refreshing juice.  Fantastic, I'd go back for the coconuts alone!  Had the Chicken Pho which was the best I've had in Phoenix.  Very tasty, and the quality of the chicken was a step up from some of the other Vietnamese places I have been.  Good compliment of mix-ins and perfect portion size.  Very satisfying."}
{"text":"Location is close to the ASU downtown campus, which gives it a couple stars right off the bat.   Ordered the Pho Bo and Spring Rolls for around $11.   Being from Seattle where Pho restaurants have made a mark within the market, I come with somewhat high standards.   The noodles were good with a decent portion -- I usually order Pho with extra noodles since I'm kind of a big eater. In terms of taste, I'd give the Pho a 5-star rating.   Spring rolls were lacking flavor. My peer thought she was getting egg rolls, which are fried...but that's her mistake.   Like all Vietnamese restaurants, the atmosphere is bare and authentic with almost a high-pace feel during lunch.   Good food, great location and portions, decent prices.  Pho is pronounced like \"Fu.\""}
{"text":"Fast Service! Which is especially appreciated when I'm on my lunch hour.  I always order the PHO and it's pretty good here..portions are a little smaller then what I'm used to but it does the job so we will keep it on the rotation."}
{"text":"This place would get my 5 stars if they spoke English but no one seemed to be able to. The menu was hilarious! Beff pho, appetisers, etc. Classic! Food was good though and to be expected from a Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Viet Kitchen came recommended from my sister as a great place for Pho so we finally decided to stop in for dinner.   Location: Easy access off the freeway and the restaurant is clean and bright.   Staff: We were greeted immediately upon walking in and were seated.  The waiter took our drink order promptly.  Menu:  The menu had a lot of items including Spring Rolls, Pho, Sandwiches, Rice dishes...  Food: We ordered Beef Pho and Chicken Pho. Our order came out quickly and piping hot! The flavor was fantastic and the portions were large. I couldn't finish my bowl :) All condiments were fresh and they included more than enough.    We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and recommend this Location.  We are looking forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Learned of this little gem through a girlfriend and gosh has it become my favorite for Pho! I introduced it to my dad and it's now our dad/daughter lunch spot and he loves it - says it reminds him of his days traveling to Hong Kong.  The Pho and Spring Rolls are always fresh and amazing not to mention super healthy!  Love that the coconut water is served right out of the coconut.  Absolutely love Viet Kitchen."}
{"text":"The sandwich was a bit thin but still good. My steak and meatball pho was good but a bit fragrant. Like it had to much star anise. Over all the food was good and so was our experience there."}
{"text":"The food was under done. I ordered the eggplant with veggies dish. I could barely cut through the eggplant or other veggies with a fork. My friend ordered the house noodles. Again, under done. You know the old saying: if you threw them together  and they stick...  well as   She ordered an Arnold Palmer which she said was grainy. They were very helpful, replacing the drink with something else.  The waitress was pleasant, but not attentive. I had flag her down at least two times.   Pho get about it!"}
{"text":"Pho Ga (chicken soup) is amazing and I love the fresh ingredients they bring with the soup. Craved this throughout my first pregnancy and have loved it ever since. The service could be friendlier."}
{"text":"What a bummer!!! I took my boys out for their first Vietnamese restaurant.  The waitress was impatient while I asked about dishes for the boys.  I ordered the fried spring rolls.  I love the traditional but I wanted my 8 year old to want to come back!  Also the chicken & veg stir fry with rice and the House Noodles w shrimp, beef, chicken & vegetables... She brought the fresh spring rolls.  Even my 10 year old said \"she ordered the fried ones for us...\" \"No, she didn't.\"  HUH?  They were average and my 10 year old liked them.  They brought it out with tiny plates that were never cleared.  The house noodles were descent.  The chicken and vegetables stir fry she suggested for my boys was overlooked chicken breast strips with Red Bell Peppers and Onions in what tasted close to straight soy sauce.  Again, two more large plates and three dinner plates, the spring roll plate and three appetizer plates, three waters and an iced tea... And not a single plate was moved or cleared the entire dinner.  When she brought our last dish she huffed at me saying \"no room.  You need to make room...\"  I picked up a few of the small plates and handed them to her to clear.  She put them back on the table spilling now with dirty dishes.  ARG!!!! A mess too?  Less than average food.  Terrible Sevice.  Strip mall location with nothing special inside.  Not going back.  I'd stop someone from going if they said they wanted to... Boo..."}
{"text":"The Chicken Noodle soup is delicious and everyone I take here is hooked by that alone.  The Vietnamese Pancake is a personal favorite.  The service is always friendly and I have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I recently saw Viet Kitchen's sign from the freeway above it and decided to stop by and give it a try.  I fully enjoyed my meal, as they have a nice menu, and while the prices are \"slightly\" higher than most Vietnamese Cafe's, the quality and presentation was there.  I will return to try more items, but my egg rolls and chicken salad were excellent.  I even met a couple that frequent it and found my entire luncheon experience delightful.  It was crowded and I was NOT the only Asian, so I KNOW it was good!"}
{"text":"This place is a mom-and-pop restaurant. The people are very friendly and personable. The food is very authentic and delicious.  I've had the noodle soup and spring rolls and they were excellent.  Looking forward to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I LOVE PHO! I've been to nearly all the pho joints in the valley.  Some were good and some poor.  I would have to put Viet Kitchen on the bottom of the list and here's why.   I've been here twice and concluded both times that they over season there broth with star anise.  The kitchen is fuming with this spice like potpourri.  Not sure if this is intentional or if they leave there broth on the stove too long; yielding in concentrated flavors... quite a disappointment.  Aside from the food, the decor was nice BUT the tables were built for little people.  Fitting 4 people at such a small table was uncomfortable.  We kept kicking each other and bumping elbows.  At one point I wanted to elbow my friend in the face.  The back side of the chairs were creaky and the whole experience was just bad."}
{"text":"Had the pho tai and it was OK.  Broth flavor could have been better.  Noodles were OK.  Been to hundreds pho restaurants so I am a tough critic.  Still enjoyable.  Lemon drink was mediocre and expensive.  Surprised it wasn't carbonated."}
{"text":"I don't know how many stars to give this place so... I got Pho special to go and springs rolls. The food is not good at all or just what I got. The pho soup is salty and smell nothing like pho. And the springs rolls, the meat is so thin u barely feel that u even have any meat in there. I got it Togo so obviously I didn't get to experience the service but they all seem nice and fast so..."}
{"text":"I have frequented the Viet Kitchen about twice a week for about three years. I have never had a bad meal at this restaurant. You can never go wrong with Pho but I also enjoy many other dishes on their vast menu. The pork & shrimp spring rolls always taste so fresh! Check this place out if you are in N. Phoenix you will probably see me there for lunch!"}
{"text":"Shrimp and veggie dish delicious.  Rare beef pho very good.  Chicken pho good but broth a little too pungent for my taste."}
{"text":"First time in and was really enjoyed the pho. I'll be back for sure! The spring rolls are great too!! Great to have super noodle place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Since my last review we have been back at least 20 times. We are regulars. Our favorite is the Veggie Pho with tofu and beef broth.The tofu and the baby bok choy YUM!!!  If I even think about it we have to go with in the net day or two. The staff remembers us. They make us feel very appreciated. Just typing this review makes me want Pho. I am sure we will be there this weekend for lunch. Lunch time is very crowded. We normally wait for the crowd to thin out. We have a difficult time ordering anything else but the Pho. I have tried a couple of other dishes and they were delicious. The bbq shrimp is delicious.  I have viewed other Vietnamese spots but I hate being disappointed. We will stay with Viet Kitchen forever!!!"}
{"text":"We've only been here one time and it didn't blow us away, but it wasn't bad either. We are new to the world of pho and this was our first experience altogether. We had the spring rolls and we both ordered different meals - I had the Pho Bo, or meatball Pho and he had the beef and rice plate.   The Pho was interesting and the more I had of it the less I think actually liked it overall.  The soup or broth was just oddly flavored for me. His beef seemed to be a bit overcooked and was pretty chewy.  The spring rolls were the best part of the meal. They had good filler and the wrap was tasty!   I think if we were to try Pho again, we would most likely try out another order here or a different place altogether.  We definitely want to give it another try since we have heard so many good things about it.  Overall: B"}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 8 times and always been very happy.   It's a nice room, the service is always good and the food is definitely a notch above most Vietnamese places.  In addition to the usual Pho flavors, they have some more interesting soups that make this place worth a trip.  I have started to venture out more on the menu and have never really been disappointed.  I hesitate to give a place 5 stars without trying a wide variety of stuff, but I feel comfortable doing so particularly because of a recent episode..  I came in right after the listed 9pm closing time.  I was feeling a rough cold coming on, I was starving, I had a 35-minute drive ahead of me and I was worried that they would turn me away.  While her family was eating, he little boy was doing homework, the woman who I assume was the owner served me and kept telling me to relax and take my time.  I felt so much better after that soup, physcially and emotionally..  I wish I could tell you the name of the soup that I often get, but I can't.  It is a more spicy broth than basic Pho and it has cabbage and pork I believe."}
{"text":"After a long delay in our return, we visited again.  Seated quickly, given utensils and the menu.  We choose the pork bun (vermicelli) and grilled chicken bun.  The food arrived quickly.  Ingredients were fresh with meat, cilantro, pickled carrots and bean sprouts.  We both thought the marinated meats were very salty.  It was still good with the Sriracha and fish sauce.  We are drinking plenty of water after the meal.  Prices are reasonable and parking lot available.  This place is not our first choice but is the most convenient travel-wise."}
{"text":"Very cinnamon-ey and salty broth. Staff was awkward and unfriendly (I think). We never got a hello or thank you or even a smile. Fish sauce and spring rolls were just okay. Lettuce was wilted in the roll. :("}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times. The food and service is normally really good. But the last time I ate there, I ordered the grill chicken rice dish and it tasted and smelled spoiled.  It was disgusting! I told the server that I didn't want it anymore and they said that I'd still have to pay for it!! I have worked in kitchens and restaurants for the last 12 years and never would I serve spoiled food and make a customer pay for it!  That was the last time I will ever eat there."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's my go-to when wanting pho. Quick service, nice atmosphere, delicious food and well priced. Couldn't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"My son & I have been going here for over 5 years. We have had most everything on their menu and it's all good!  The service is excellent - they always remember us/me. When I'm hungry for Pho or a Tofu dish, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Went here cause I wanted to try their banh cuon since hardly any restaurants in Vegas make it.  It wasn't as silky as my mom's but it satisfied my craving.  I also ordered the snails in coconut milk and it was good also.  Right now, it will stay on my \"will be back\" list as there are plenty of things on the menu that most Vietnamese restaurants don't carry like goat dishes, banh cuon, banh beo, bun mang vit (duck and bamboo shoots) and more!  My next trip is to try their Cha Ca Thanh Long, a specialty dish of sizzling fish with turmeric and dill on a hot plate.  I don't know of anyone else in Vegas that has it and if you want to know what it is, watch an episode of Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods when he was traveling in Hanoi.  They also have chung vit lon (that's balut to most people) with tamarind that I want to try since I LOVE balut, I can eat half a dozen in one sitting :)  They are located next to SF Market, in the old Ba Le Sandwich place.  It was pretty empty when I went in today for lunch so I hope they last awhile.  The last place I really liked that had Bun Cha Hanoi is now closed so I'm back to searching for that again....sigh..."}
{"text":"We tried Viet Kitchen today based on a recommendation from a vegan food list. We went for lunch, and they were surprisingly busy. We were in a rush so we didn't ask the usual \"is the sauce vegan?\" questions we normally ask, and trusted the recommendation.  We ordered the veggie spring rolls with peanut sauce and the tofu with brown sauce. The spring rolls were good. They had cooked tofu, rice noodles and greens. The peanut sauce was thick and had a decent flavor, but it was a bit bland. A touch of Sriracha and soy sauce livened it up. I loved that since we got four spring rolls, we got two dishes of peanut sauce. I hate sharing peanut sauce!  The tofu dish was okay, but not great. The tofu was a bit dry and the onions could have been cooked more. There was an odd flavor that I couldn't identify. I hope it wasn't meat broth or fish oil! It wasn't offensive, but it didn't make me want more.  The best part of the visit was the service. We were seated and served quickly. Our servers were attentive but not intrusive. We never said we were in a rush but I think they read us well. We were in and out in about 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants-hands down! Amazing atmosphere, food and service. I usually order the tofu and veggie pho with beef broth. I'm not a vegetarian, but enjoy the flavor of the beef broth and would rather go without actual meet so I substitute tofu. Their shrimp and pork spring rolls are amazing too. They also just got boba tea, which is a game changer. I wouldn't say that it is the best that I've had, but definitely still order one every time I go. I recommend taro or coconut with boba. So much yum!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. It just gets worse every time. I only go there cause is near by. People work there are rude and dishonest. They made a mistake on my Togo order, which I'm ok with it, everyone makes mistake. I called back to let them know about incorrect order. There wasn't even a \"sorry\".... They said that it was impossible they made a mistake. Well... I guess in their mind... I've made a mistake. I wasn't in the mood to argue, but, the lady answer sure is."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pho is the best I've had in the US. Also, the summer rolls are good too. Service is prompt. My one complaint is that the chairs and tables are awkward and small."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant for Vietnamese cuisine. The quang nam noodle soup is amazing! The staff is very friendly and will explain the dishes to any novices (like me).  Prompt service during lunch hours and the restaurant is very clean.  I always stop by when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times whenever I visit family in Phoenix since they always insist on eating here.  For whatever reason, my siblings really like the food.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  The pho is flavorless.  The banh pho (noodles) are over cooked.  As noted in other posts about pho, any time I have to add hoisin sauce to make it more flavorful is a bad sign.  My wife had the My Quang and it was unrecognizable.  First, it's a noodle bowl that should have very little sauce added to it. This version had enough \"broth\" to call it a soup.  Should be no broth in this dish.  My kids got the pork egg rolls which were 99% veggies.  If you concentrate, you could taste some pork.  The only thing noteworthy is their service. They are very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I was sick with the flu and didn't feel like cooking. Ordered over the phone for a pick up order. We ordered Chicken Pho noodle soup (which is always good when your sick) and my family ordered rice with Bo Luc Lac and Eggrolls.  The Chicken Pho noodle soup was disappointing because it was not made with chicken stock broth as far as I can tell. It tasted like the broth used for the beef Pho noodle soup. The rice was dry. The Bo Luc Lac was ok, not as tender as I've had before at other places. My family did not like the eggrolls. It had too much pepper in the filling.  If you've never had Vietnamese food before don't go here for your first taste. It's not a good representation."}
{"text":"If I could give them a 10-star review, I would! This place is always busy, and it's for a fine reason - their food is delicious! Truly the best Vietnamese food restaurant I've been to anywhere, hands down.   You have to get the coconut water. They serve it fresh out of a cold coconut, and once you're done with it they slice it open for you to enjoy.  The broth of the house Pho is simply exquisite. It's so savory there was no need for me to add spices. Other staples like the Vietnamese coffee and spring rolls are also excellent.  Their portions are so perfect! Hard for you to leave hungry.   Everything about this place is wonderful, including the staff and decor. Looooove it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese Restaurant in Phoenix and possibly the best I have tried in the US.  There is another one of note in Cincinnati at the Findley Market.  The Vietnamese egg rolls and the the Pho are exceptional.  We have tried the crepe and some of the rice and noodle dishes and everything has always been very good prepareed with good quality ingredients.  The restaurant is clean and the decor is Asian.  Good wait staff and service has always been quick.  I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"As far as Phoenix goes, this is the best Vietnamese Restaurant that I have found.  Maybe not a trendy, innovative location, but clean and offers amazing service.  The Pho and Bun are to die for.  Ambiance = 3* Service = 5* Food = 5* Cleanliness = 4*"}
{"text":"Viet kitchen is quite the restaurant. They offer excellent customer service. The service is great. They have a fantastic menu and food. The restaurant was quite clean and a wonderful atompshere. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll admit this right off the bat. I'm new to Vietnamese food, my first experience was Pho Avina, which set the bar high.   I'm very glad to say that Viet Kitchen has provided me a place in the North Valley for delicious food.   First off, the service is decent.  All of the staff is very pleasant, and food delivery is quick. The interior of Viet Kitchen make it seem like a 4 star restaurant, although I think the massive TV on the wall needs to be replaced by a painting.  Anyways, the food. It's what you'd expect. Warm, savory broth that you want to drink, fresh ingredients, fresh add-ons like basil and bean sprouts, and the noodles were well prepared a delicious. Add some sriracha and call it a day.  I had a Pho that contained slices of beef that cooked throughout the meal, along with meatballs. Now while I couldn't tell if the meatballs were homemade or not, they were still delicious. We also had the eggrolls, which seemed like they were more ruffage than actual meat, but the peanut sauce they came with was heavenly. I could eat anything dipped in that sauce.  Good prices helped round out a nice dining experience, and I will be back for sure.  I do wish they'd figure out their menu though, or at least get an editor. On that note, I do wish there were more items, maybe not \"Cheesecake Factory\" levels of menu items, but at least some more variety, like what Avina provides.   But for now, this place is great, and I can't wait to see it grow."}
{"text":"I placed an order on a Monday at 4:30 pm. My order went through and my card was charged. When my husband went to pick up the food there was a paper sign on the door saying they are closed. It's a very frustrating process to get reimbursed for our order, not to mention the time it took out of our day. I tried calling the restaurant and the \"mailbox is full\". Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Another good Pho place , everything was fresh and very tasteful . Clean establishment , smelled of fresh cut basil upon walking in :) .. Friendly staff and decent prices . If you live in this area and have not been here yet and looking for something new , give it a try , you won't be disappointed . Will def be back for more !"}
{"text":"This place did not leave me disappointed I usually get chicken pho and since they offered boba tea I tried their mango and it was amazing! Exactly what I needed before a long drive thank you!"}
{"text":"The only thing I've had at Viet Kitchen is the Pho Dac Biet. It's a huge bowl of lovely sliced steak and meatballs and tripe and tendon and broth and onions and just so much goodness. Today I had it, and it was as good as I remember it. It's very clean, and very yummy. They serve it up with a side of thai basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, jalapenos, and lime. I just load my bowl with it and some rooster sauce and have at it. It's soooo filling and soooo good and well, damn. I kinda want some more.   The wait staff is friendly, the prices are good, and the green iced tea is tasty."}
{"text":"Among my favorite pho restaurants in the valley. Very clean with nice modern finishes. Owners and staff are very friendly. Love the rare beef pho. Ask for beef on the side and douse it with lime, pepper, and salt (to your liking) - let that sit a few minutes and then add it to your soup. Killer. :-)"}
{"text":"Got the Grilled Chicken vermicelli (bun).  Pretty good.  Lots of chicken with good flavor.  I liked that you can choose dark or white meat since I like dark and so many places are now just defaulting to white meat. For those who like white meat. You do have to pay $1 more though.  Friend got the #1 Beef pho. Said there wasn't as much meat as the place he normally goes to."}
{"text":"Solid Vietnamese for Phoenix. We come frequently. Bun Bo Hue is solid. Pho is better than average. Fast service. Friendly staff. Little on the warm side inside. Now if we were in California, this would be 3 stars."}
{"text":"I take my sweet mom to lunch at least twice a month, so she can get out of the house once in a while. She likes Vietnamese cuisine, so I searched on Yelp to find something close to downtown.  I stumbled upon Dolores G's review and she seemed to like it, so I brought my mom here. My Mom ordered the house stir fry which is a noodle with beef, pork, shrimp, chicken and veggies stir fry. ($8.75) and I ordered the Sauteed Tofu with Tomatoes and Onions and Thai Tea. ($7.50). Given our hunger levels, we also ordered a couple of fresh Spring Rolls and shared a pot of hot tea. Mom really enjoyed her savory dish, Mine on the other hand was just fine. I guess I was expecting it to be more flavorful, but it's just Tofu with sauteed tomatoes and onions which I can easily make at home. I thought it was a little  under flavored in my opinion-- nothing that a shot of Sriracha and a few dabs of chili pepper sauce couldn't cure though. Portions are not too big just a scoop of rice and the entree', so if you have a big appetite better go to a buffet instead. But to be fair, I am giving them 4 stars for providing a clean establishment, good service and reasonably priced dishes."}
{"text":"What a gem to find. Pho is great with a lot of veggies. Had the stir fry today and it was awesome. The staff is super nice. Want a great meal hot, fresh, quick with pleasant service try this spot. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's about time they have something like this downtown! This was my first experience with Vietnamese food, and I am officially a fan! The server recommended the Prime PHO soup, awesome! I've heard of Vietnamese soup before and now I know what everyone raves about. Next time I plan on trying one of their French style sandwiches. Great staff, very clean place. I will be returning."}
{"text":"CLOSED?!?!?! WTF? It's now a sushi place that I have not tried and therefore will not comment on but now what the hell am I supposed to do for downtown pho? Man oh man...and it's really cold today too...."}
{"text":"If you're cravin asian food this place is Pho Real!  We order through the Yelp app and our food is always waiting for us when we pick up. Fast, clean, delicious and convenient.  The inside is always full or near full of happy diners sure sign of good eats!"}
{"text":"I'm a purist with soups. It's all about that broth baby. A bit too salty, but really good here. The broth's five spice was subtle compared to another place I went to.   Ordered my favorite cuts: tripe and tendon. I didn't go for the rice noodles because I also got the pork vermicelli dish. Next time, I'm gunna ask them to make my fish sauce extra fishy for that dish. I know the fish sauce was dumbed down to make it easy for sensitive nose types.  Coming back soon for sure for my beauty food fix! :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome Vietnamese cuisine and so close to home. Very authentic and flavorful. Pho has become increasingly popular in recent years and many places are now serving this phenomenal soup. But, alas not everyone can deliver the goods when it comes to a great bowl of Pho. Viet Kitchen CAN! Awesome Pho, fresh and diverse menu options, amazing spring rolls & excellent service/ambiance to boot. I will be coming for Pho as long as their doors are open. Very happy to have found this spot. I was driving to my old spot in the East Valley for PHO....jeeze. No more. A+ Viet Kitchen."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place since it's close to my house, very clean and has nice people who work there.  I ordered take out and it was ready to go when I got there.  They even had to go cups so I could take home a Vietnamese coffee....I ordered the special Pho with beef, tendon, tripe and meatball, some spring rolls and Bun with grilled beef.  The broth in the Pho was really delicious!  It was very complex and had lots of star anise and other yummy spices. The usual accoutrements of bean sprouts, lime, basil and jalapenos were ample and fresh, but the meats used just tasted weird....kinda stale and off.....and the meatball was rubbery.  The same offish taste was present in the spring rolls.  I love me a good spring roll but although they looked delicious, the slice of pork in the roll just tasted bad.  Plus the peanut sauce was very bland.  Lastly, the Bun,  a meat and noodle salad if you will, was passable but I like to doctor mine up with Hoisin sauce and there was none in the bag.  Perhaps because in this dish the meat was grilled, it had much better flavor than the meats in the other dishes.  I might go back on a cold day, get the Pho again and just drink the broth, because it was very tasty, but I will continue my search for a better Valley Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Last night we ordered a couple of vermicelli dishes and an order of egg rolls for pick up. We were told they would be ready in 15 minutes. When my husband got there, they were just bagging them up. When he arrived home, they were still hot and fresh. I ordered the beef, and my husband ordered the pork. Plenty of meat on each, and both were tender and had lots of flavor. The egg rolls are the best around."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Vietnamese food and am happy to have a modern new Vietnamese restaurant downtown. I went for lunch and had the Mi Quang (Quang-Nam noodles with shrimp and vegies) and Gon Cuon (Vietnamese spring rolls). The noodle dish was good--very fresh tasting and was made even better with the addition of some Siracha sauce. The spring rolls and dipping sauce were delicious as served. The food was reasonably priced for a sit down restaurant. The service was efficient and friendly. I will definitely return for a workday lunch--there were a number of dishes served to people sitting near me that looked and smelled yummy."}
{"text":"Legit. Spring rolls and vermicelli were bomb. It's all about the fish sauce and this place's is on point!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a busy Friday before Christmas. Service was above average and Pho was very good. Traditional like many Pho Ga's. Nothing stands out to make it any different or amazing. A good healthy lunch at a clean well run place. Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Could be because I've never met a bowl of pho I didn't like, but I could slurp this stuff up all day.  Viet Kitchen does a decent job with their pho; the broth is so delicious and soothing. I have only ever gotten pho at all the Vietnamese restaurants I've been to, and here's what I didn't like about Viet Kitchen's: the chicken is somewhat dry and tasteless.  The broth has a ton of flavor, so when you eat a piece of chicken with the broth it is fine. But to eat it alone, is way too plain. All they need to do is season it up a bit before cooking it. Also, the spring rolls were very fresh and great dipped in the sauce. Without the sauce, they would have been a bit dry, too. Overall, this is my go-to place for pho since it is so close to my house."}
{"text":"No refill for water. Salty ass meat. Small ass coffee. Never coming back. Save your money for a better place bruh"}
{"text":"Craving something spicy I finally walked into this place. The establishment is very clean and the service was phenomenal.  I got the rare beef pho which was delightful. The only thing I wasn't crazy about is the spring rolls. They were pre made and cold like it was in the fridge.   Otherwise. A solid place to get pho :) can't beat that."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. This is not your mamas Viet food establishment. A must try in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"They're across the street from where I live so it gets me my Vietnamese fix when I need it, usually after a good workout. I've tried many of their dishes now. Not the biggest fan of any of their rolls (crispy or fresh) but they are decent. Sandwiches are yummy when you get fresh bread. A couple times it was stale and chewy to the point I couldn't even eat the ends. The pho is pretty good. Not too oily. Decent flavor. Sometimes too much noodles but you know sometimes people like a lot of them. Bun is good but can be light on meat at times. Coconut juice is good. Coffee is not as strong as other places. Overall I enjoy the experience because the staff is friendly and accommodating (not that I require much). They have a happy hour thing from 2-5 on weekdays but I don't quite understand it and haven't been able to try it yet.  Basically if your in the area I definitely recommend coming in. If your far and just like checking out the valley's selection of Asian cuisine it might not be worth your time, but I'd still recommend if you happen to be headed this way."}
{"text":"Bait and switch.   The menu that is online is not the same menu that is in the restaurant. The online menu lists several vegetarian dishes, the restaurant menu does not.   When my sister and I arrived we each knew what we were going to order, but did not see those dishes on the menu. Plan B: she went with a lemon grass beef dish with rice. I reluctantly ordered the chicken noodle soup. I had them swap out the chicken and replace it shrimp. I should have known better, but I was hungry and not think clearly.  Later that afternoon I became queasy and threw up. I do not believe I became sick because the food was bad, I think it was because of the chicken broth. It's been a while since I've eaten meat and the chicken broth did not agree with me.  Now to be nit picky, the chairs are hard and uncomfortable. The waitress was a bit odd, she kept steering diners away from a particular table saying it was because she just lit some incense. My sister and I watched her tell 4 diners they could not sit there then a lone man comes in and sits there. Favoritism at the Viet Kitchen??  Do not go here if you are vegetarian, vegan, prefer a table up front or dislike hard chairs."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, I may have reviewed this place before. I think it's under new management, I didn't recognize the new staff or cooks in the kitchen. Food is good, I have no complaints about that. If you live in this area of town I imagine there are not many choices for Vietnamese food. My only complaint was the price for a bowl of pho. Almost $10 with tax. I'm sorry but that is just too much so I won't be going back. Not when most other places are in the $6-7 range. Maybe it's the location, I figure rent is really high. Just be warned."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place instead of Tea Lite Cafe because Tea Lite has a rude man there always accusing me of taking soda from machine for free.  First time, the  vermicelli pork was good.  The second time the pho tasted like canned broth with too much anise.  My child said it was the worse he has ever eaten.  Don't go there for pho.  The atmosphere is good but the food is just too terrible."}
{"text":"Great place nice service. Delicious food  just crowded and felt squished. Seems like take out would be  better option"}
{"text":"I walked in and was immediately greeted by the waitress and was seated in a booth. Chairs are all wood and a bit stiff, but not that bad. I ordered the bun bo dac biet and a Pepsi. The waitress was kind enough to answer all of my questions as well as help me pronounce the name of the dish.  Food came out quickly enough, and.... OH. MY. GOODNESS.  The food was amazing.  I had never had Vietnamese food before, and I will FOR SURE be returning to try more things on the menu.  I was hoping that the price would be a bit lower, but it definitely is good for the food that you get."}
{"text":"BBQ pork vermicelli was not good. Pork was dry and burnt. Taste was pretty bland. Wouldn't recommend. The environment was pretty friendly though. Small place with speedy service. Wish the food was better."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - 3 Doors Down - Here Without You)  My hungry days have made me slower Since the last time that I had delicious Pho A thousand meals have made me wiser And I don't think I can taste Pho as the same  But all the restaurants that separate Disappear now when I'm Bo Biting in your place  I'm at the Viet Kitchen, baby And I'm hungry out of my mind I think about Pho, baby And I dream about it all the time  I'm at the Viet Kitchen, baby But you're still with me in my dreams And for lunch it's only Pho and me, yeah.  Viet Kitchen is one of those new aged Americanize Vietnamese restaurants.    Their menu even breakdown what the meals are.  I hope someday we can all walk into a Vietnamese restaurant and say \"Pho sounds good!\" without thinking \"what the heck is Fho?\".  Needless to say, Viet Kitchen has been one of my favorite lunch spots simply because it's close to my office.    In the end, I give them much love for being around for so long, and as I can see more and more customers are becoming familiar with the cuisine. The Pho here is pretty good and seems to get better every time.  The broth is not as pungent and steamy as the way I like it; tad bit too subtle for my palate.  When it's called Beef Noodle soup on the menu then you know why.  The eggrolls was good, but my lettuce came somewhat brown so that was downer.    In the end, service needs to improve and the ambiance is okay with your basic Vietnamese decors, but I do appreciate the large flat screens.  Would I come back, of course it's the closets Vietnamese restaurant to my office! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Viet Kitchen is our go-to as they are one of the very few valley Ph? places offering veggie broth. For some reason they are a bit stingy with their lines, otherwise the service is always really good and friendly with nice, clean decor.   In addition to the veggie ph? I normally get the tofu spring rolls and they are great. My husband gets the rare beef with meatballs, and my brother-in-law has had fried rice and some noodle dishes he has always been happy with. The table has also had the pancake (bun xiao) and always seems to enjoy.    Definitely a solid choice for Ph? in the North Valley"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place with an awesome Vietnamese sandwich after stumbling across one in Newport Beach, CA. This is almost as good and certainly the best we've found in AZ! The pho was also the most flavorful we've had and the summer rolls were amazing! Everything we tried was packed with flavor! We will be back."}
{"text":"This spot is right across the street from my doctors office and my eyeballs have been peeled since I'm new to the area. If there's one thing I love - ITS PHO! DELICIOUS PHO! I saw VIET KITCHEN and made an immediate U-Turn...totally happy I did!!  Husband and I walked in and ordered our usual - An order of shrimp and pork spring rolls, chicken pho for me and brisket/pork pho for him. Our order was taken promptly and our spring rolls were on our table in a matter of minutes. Their spring rolls are thinner than what were used to and they were cut in half, which I'm totally NOT used to, but they were tasty.  Our pho arrived 5 minutes later along with their fixings and wow! The broth was PERFECT! I love this place! Plenty of tables, so no wait. Plenty of parking, so no worries there. One thing I WILL request on my next visit, is, please DONT cut the spring rolls! Other than that - 0 complaints!!"}
{"text":"I went back to Viet Kitchen yesterday to see if I would like it any better and I went armed with my own soup spoon.  Result: Muuuuuuch better dining experience. :)  I'm ready to go again.  Who's all up for it?"}
{"text":"My favorite pho place. I actually order the Bun Bo? (English: spicey way) but it still comes with all the pho fixings. The chunks of brisket and pork in the soup are extremely satisfying and the broth is pho-ey with a kick. Veggies are always fresh. Service is the typical of any mom and pop place. The Vietnamese coffee (iced) is to die for if you like strong and creamy. I've yet to have the Boba, but I am happier that it's added to the menu. I'm always pretty happy walking out of here."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner with my wife at one of our most frequented Asian restaurants, Viet Kitchen (20235 North Cave Creek Road, Phoenix, AZ 85024). We ordered our usual Shrimp Spring Rolls with peanut dipping sauce, Lotus Stem Salad with shrimp and Eggplant Stir-Fry with a large scoop of Jasmine Rice. The meal was accompanied by an aromatic pot of hot Lotus Tea. This restaurant serves excellent Vietnamese cuisine, which offers many healthy choices of the freshest vegetables available! The facilities are clean, the staff is so very friendly and parking is readily available."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place, but unfortunately will not be returning.  The service has gotten progressively worse. The food never comes out at the same time for all the guests, and I've even waited half-way through my friend's meal before my food showed up.  It's always taken FOREVER to get your check, and on many occasions have had to go up to the counter to ASK for the check.  These are things I have tolerated over time, but my last encounter was beyond overlooking.  I made the mistake of asking about ingredients used in a particular dish, due to a food allergy.  That was, apparently, the WRONG thing to ask. Even after very reluctant clarification (like I was bothering her) the dish came out with that ingredient...very dangerous situation for me to say the least.  There are many other Vietnamese restaurants that could use support, so I will find another that appreciates my business."}
{"text":"Best flavored Vietnamese food! You won't be disappointed! The egg rolls arrived piping hot and tasty. Pho was flavored perfectly even tasty broth. We also had the BBQ beef vermicelli and it was great!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Viet Kitchen. I ordered a steak rice dish. Pretty disappointing. One scoop of rice, 7 pieces of chopped beef and 5 fries.   Seriously? Seriously? the steak was dry. the food was not even close to filling. and why the heck was there only 5 fries? Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?"}
{"text":"Chicken soup is delicious plastic chairs uncomfortable kinda noisy"}
{"text":"Really fresh and lite with full flavor and a decent price. The service is quick and the food will get you full without leaving you feeling bloated."}
{"text":"Grabbed some togo on my way home, picked up the BBQ beef bun and Imperial roll per a previous review and I was totally pleased!!! Very good flavor, large portion and very friendly staff! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, went back a second time and had an almost identical experience.  Food was still very good, but had not changed at all.  I've downgraded my rating because after having my soup the second time I still believe the soup broth is understated and really would like them to up their beefiness.  Again, for some the lack of depth may be a refreshing and light meal, but I like my Pho broth bolder.      The food quality is really good and I may update again as I make my way through the menu.  But considering Pho is a reason many people go for Vietnamese, I am desiring more..."}
{"text":"Super slow service and okay food  Was nearby for work and we were in the mood for some pho and bun. Something of  a trend, lately...  Entering Viet Kitchen, it's a nice little restaurant new Jimmy John's. We were in a hurry and had to wave at the waitresses and bar to sit. After sitting ready to order for almost ten minutes, I again had to waive at a waitress to get service. Shared that we were in a hurry and she said okay.   Pho was okay. Broth wasn't rich, hot, or tasty; more the bland standard you expect from Asian Fusion places. Noodles were a tad chewy. Good enough to eat but not something you savor. My guest said the bun wasn't super flavorful, either. Ho-hum. And the eggrolls were much more cheap cabbage/lettuce than meat. At least the prices were reasonable.  With some attention to detail, small upgrades to the food, and a step up on the service, this place could be stellar. Alas..."}
{"text":"Brought home take out a last weekend during my visit in Phoenix.  The food was good not amazing but good.  I got BBQ chicken vermicelli.  It lacked some flavor but portion was a good size and overall I did enjoy it.  Prices are reasonable and the food was ready when I arrived to pick it.  Restaurant was full.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Some workers inside the kitchen kept sneezing where the food is prepared for consumption.  And some waitress would rub and touch her nose while doing her job.  This is totally gross and is health code violation.  Patrons in the restaurant seemed hesitant to address this maybe due to the fact the all the workers were foreigners."}
{"text":"The only thing I've had here are the egg rolls and Bahn Xeo yum! Always fresh romaine, mint and cilantro! All 3x served HOT and fresh, thank you! And I like the viet ice coffee"}
{"text":"Reviews for businesses on their first day open are always open for adjustment later.  Vietnamese food is my latest passion. I've occasionally eaten it since I was a child, but lately it's been an obsession, cooking it, eating it, and learning as much as I can. When I heard a Vietnamese restaurant was opening within just blocks of my home, I was beyond ecstatic, licking my chops with anticipation. Viet Kitchen operates another location on 101 and Cave Creek Road, which is well regarded but not considered the top of it's realm. The new location downtown took over where Restaurant Acapulco was located, a place I liked for breakfast, but was downright embarassing for any other meal.  Upon walking in, I was somewhat confused by the \"order here\" sign, but the owner telling me to have a seat. Is this a counter order or a full service? I knew what I wanted, Bun Bi Cha Gio, so I ordered it at the counter and then had a seat. Service was typical of a Vietnamese joint, food and drink come out quickly, then you never see anyone again. This is not a sign of bad service, just a sign of a different style and culture... if you want something, you're expected to tell them. If they don't hear you speak up, then they assume you don't need them. By \"them\" I mean restaurant employees not \"those people.\"   When my food came, one of two things were painfully obvious, either they are cutting corners, or they couldn't get the right ingredients on the first day open. There was bagged, shredded Iceberg Lettuce in my Bun... WHAT? It threw off the flavor of the entire dish, and I've never had anything but Romaine at any restaurant, which is how it's supposed to be done. Their Nuoc Mam was very disappointing as well, and was missing the punch you get from the usual Chili, Garlic, and was a little boring. Overall, I thought the dish was not well done, though they were very generous with the grilled pork and egg roll and both were ok in quality... pork a bit fatty.   Overall, I'm thankful to have this restaurant in the neighborhood, and I feel that it will improve over time. It's clean, the staff is friendly, and it's overly convienent. I was prepared for the prices being higher, which is expected when your rent is high, but $10.50 for Bun and Iced Tea is crazy. Most places the same order costs me $7 and I can often get Goi Cuon with it and still be $10 and I'm stuffed. Oh well. Convienence costs.   I wouldn't make a special trip for this place, but if you live downtown it will get the job done. I *hope* the Iceberg Lettuce was just a first day thing, and I'm under the assumption that it is, but if I go back again and they have Iceberg, I'm swearing this place off."}
{"text":"On the advice of a good friend we ordered 40 egg rolls from here for a party. Our friend is a regular at Viet Kitchen and told us they were friendly and had great customer service so we thought it worth the drive from central Phoenix. Well, she was definitely wrong! When we called in our order, we asked to have them ready by 2:00-2:30pm. When I arrived at 2:30pm to pick them up, I was told that they were not supposed to be picked up until 2pm. When I explained that it was 2:30pm, she simply said \"Oh\" and looked down at her order pad. I had to ask if they were ready or if they would be ready soon. She went and spoke with another woman and then told me that they would be ready in 15 min. No apology offered.  I was so irritated and would have just left, but I needed these egg rolls for the party. I was sure I would get at least an apology when they were ready,  and maybe a discount or an add on to make up for the mistake and my additional wait. When they were ready, I paid and they handed them to me. All that was said to me was that they were hot so leave the lid off. No we are sorry, no discount, nothing! They didn't even give us any sauce. This was such a frustrating experience!! Viet Kitchen needs to learn that an apology will go a long way. Even though the egg rolls were good,  we will not go there again."}
{"text":"I eat here and I just felt that the soup was way too salty and just too much seasoning when into it. It was my first time eating there I didn't have a horrible experience but I don't think I'd be coming here again just because I don't like this kind of style of pho. It just can't be da vang on 19 Ave and camelback"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant and friendly staff.  Reasonable prices and good portions.  Very crowded parking lot with Costco.  One of the only restaurants in North Phoenix I've been to where it feels like home."}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating here. The rice noodle dishes are gluten free and healthy. Plus the portions are big so you have leftovers for lunch the next day! Pho is tasty as well. Service is typically good and food is served promptly. Prices are quite reasonable. The Thai iced teas are so yum-o!"}
{"text":"I been here about 10 times now they have consistently served the silkiest perfectly cooked pho noodles out of the whole valley, only con is their tiny tables (hobbits)"}
{"text":"being a vegetarian I didn't think I would ever get a chance to try pho.  This place has blown me away and its now my go to place whenever I don't feel like slaving over a hot stove.  Their peanut sauce is delicious with the spring rolls, and I'm never disappointed  with my order."}
{"text":"Updated review: this is still a great little neighborhood spot, and although the prices may be a bit higher than the less desirable locations farther South, the food is stellar and the service is quick and sharp. Vermicelli bowl with BBQ chicken was delicious, as usual. Chicken stir-fry, gorgeous.  special orders: accommodated happily.  In and out in under 45 minutes."}
{"text":"I can't claim to be a Vietnamese food expert, but I do like it and am a pretty adventurous eater. Viet kitchen is very good. Consistently good quality and always reliable as to what you are going to get. The Pho is, in my opinion, the best in town. Seems authentic and the people are always incredibly interested in how I like the food. I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and I have got to say its actually pretty good flavor wise for being in downtown phoenix.  I have had the soup twice and the pork sandwich once.  Not sure if this helps but stick with the soup.  Get the double size.  The springs rolls are pretty good too.  Do not get the sandwich unless you are in the mood for something small.  The portions are not very big here but the food is big on flavor.  The service here is not that great though pretty slow.  If you are in a crunch for lunch I would not recommend unless you order over the phone and pick up.  The prices are pretty decent.  I will return as its the only Vietnamese place near my work."}
{"text":"Recently had wonderful, fresh, and lively food for lunch on a Sat.  My husband had a beef salad (made his eyes roll with delight), and I had excellent Chicken Pho with the typical additions on the side.  Delicious spring rolls.  Friendly, helpful wait staff.  Clean, pleasant decor.  A very economical and rewarding experience.  We'll be back!  Thank you, Viet Kitchen."}
{"text":"This cute restaurant has great Pho and great service. Lots of interesting items on the menu which I am anxious to try. The presentation of the food is awesome and they make sure your drinks are kept filled which is always a plus for me."}
{"text":"I love Viet kitchen. The food is good and the restaurant is very clean. $4 for Thai iced tea is a little bit pricy."}
{"text":"Things must have gone down the drain since my last visit as my last experience in terms of food quality was horrible.Other than the smiling waitress, the sprng rolls tasted right out of the freezer and my chicken curry was everything left to be desired. the chicken did not taste fresh and the dish was unappetizing."}
{"text":"I went back today with an old friend and had a great lunch.  She had the chicken pho and I had the rare beef.  We also shared the vietnamese egg rolls which are excellent.  As always the service was great and the food was the best I've had in Phoenix for Pho.  If you like Pho it's my favorite in the valley so check it out."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. They close at 9, I get there at 812 and they say \"to go only, kitchen is closed\"  If the kitchen is closed then how will you give me pho to go?!?  I was by myself and knew exactly what I wanted. I guess they close 47 minutes early."}
{"text":"whoop whoop !!!! Pho spot by my job so i can pho it un on my lunch hour !!...hollllllaaaaaaa!!  okay just had to get the happiness outta my system. i was craving pho(even though i just had it for dinner last night) and thought what the hell i will check around here and BAM a spot popped up! nice and easy walk and the size of this place is decent as well. nothing to spectualar inside but nontheless far from dirty and kept organized!  Got some pho(meatless) to go and it was delicioso! i have had better, but it fixed my lunch hr craving and made my afternoon so much brighter, so yes it was delicioso in my book !  They do have a fairly large menu, my friend enjoyed her eggrolls as well.   So glad there is Pho in CenPho!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Crepe pancake is good  Shaken beef vermicelli is good Viet kitchen house fried rice is good Service is excellent Atmosphere is nice Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"When the entire staff knows your wife and her order so well that when I walk in to pickup her order they call me \"Mr Trish\", you know you eat there too much.  But when the food is that good it is easy to do.  Consistently good.  Fair priced, and service with a tiny attitude is always preferred."}
{"text":"If you're looking for vegetarian pho you have found your place! They make a super flavorful veggie pho broth, with vegetables, rice noodles, and fried tofu. I tried many places for a good vegetarian option that wasn't bland... Or a veggie option at all. They also have vegetarian spring rolls. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Not bad....not bad at all....solid 3.5 stars and rounded up for its convenient distance from my office (and home too). Today's trip I walked in and stared at the small trifold paper Carry Out menu (which is also their dine in menu). I knew I wanted to try their Spring Rolls, that is a given for me at just about any Vietnamese restaurant.   I had several minutes to study the menu, and the dishes of the diners around me. Large bowls of steamy pho, fresh green mint, cilantro and crisp mung bean sprouts. Plates of colorful vegetables in fragrant sauces....MMMM....   Ok, so ultimately I decided while the Pho looked good and I was taking this to go I would keep it simple. Looking over their sandwich selection I it looked good but didn't suit my mood.  So along with an order of 2 Spring Rolls, I decided on the small order (3) of Vietnamese (\"Viet\") egg rolls. Both types of Rolls were about the same size. [Other Vietnamese places the Spring rolls are at least 2xs the size of the egg rolls.]  The Spring Rolls had sliced tender pork and shrimp served with a peanut sauce. The peanut sauce here is not my favorite but I typically enjoy the nuoc nam better with my Spring Rolls... The Viet Egg Rolls were filled with a flavorful mix of peppered pork and vegetables, and served traditionally with the lettuce leaf, mint, cilantro, chile and nuoc nam.   For those interested in pricing: Most items on the menu and  Pho options are between $7.25 and $7.50 and the bowls are large! Sandwiches are all $4.99 and they list that the bread is made in house. Their stir frys average $8.75. Hot Pots and Hot Pans are their most expensive thing on the menu ranging between $14 and $20 but this is a meal for at least 2.     I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I always order the \"Pho Dac Biet\" and I love it every time. It's a good portion size when you're hungry and their service is nice and quick. They're really nice people who attend to all your needs when asked. So, I definitely recommend this place for all Vietnamese food lovers."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pho Tai (Rare Beef) for lunch. The Pho was good and prices were very reasonable. However, the portions were a little small. I will return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times for this same dish! Great little spot right off the freeway, great service, oriental decor, good overall lunch spot"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and so fast. Great place to pick up a quick healthy lunch or dinner. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Viet Kitchen is becoming one of our \"go to\" spots and that's saying something because we are a fair way north of here but will even make the run south versus going someplace closer for pho / noodles etc. When out/about in this area it's definitely an easy choice for consistency of taste, quality and value and is easily accessible off the 101 and Cave Creek Road.    I tend to stick with the Pho Saigon or Rare Beef Pho. Their broth is delicious and well layered in flavor - not greasy but has just enough weight to it. I appreciate how they package it \"to go\" - with the beef/meats in the broth and the cold ingredients (noodles included) in a separate container.   My hub usually opts for a noodle dish - usually the House Noodles Stir Fry (rice or egg) which comes with veggies, shrimp, chicken and beef. I'm a fan of these dishes as well.   Their spring rolls are really good too and those come with a peanut sauce that, in my opinion, could be a little thicker but the flavor is good. The menu also offers plenty of rice-dishes as well as some sandwiches but we tend to stick with our old favorites. Maybe I'll blow open my world and get a banh mi with my soup next time!   Their prices are reasonable and their service is straightforward - haven't had an error yet over many orders. It's nice and slow in the restaurant (strip mall kitsch) during off-peak hours (like 2-5 and it looks like a nice place to just chill out and slurp some soup; I love that they stay open throughout the day v. the closing for an hour or two between lunch/dinner.) It gets PACKED on weekends during dinnertime (line of people outside) and thankfully our to-go order was ready in the promised 20 minutes.   Very pleased with Viet Kitchen, thanks!"}
{"text":"Great service. Water was refilled several times. Spring rolls were a bit chewy, but Pho Ga was great.   Even though it's in a strip mall, it's actually a pretty nice little place.  Very open and bright lighting so you won't get a lot of privacy.  Above average Pho place."}
{"text":"I live close and have been here dozens of times. The spring rolls and Vietnamese egg rolls are awesome.  I've had pretty much everything on the menu from the Pho, rice dishes, sandwiches but my absolute favorites are the vermicelli noodle salads with BBQ pork, shrimp or beef.  I have a great story about the owners as well. I went there solo one night (the wife had a girls night) and I forgot my wallet! I realized right after I ordered and told my server. She said no big deal you can pay next time. How cool was that! I felt weird about not paying so I ate quickly then drove home and returned to pay.  I always bring out of town friends here and recommend them locals also."}
{"text":"Viet Kitchen opened a second location at 114 W. Adams St. in Downtown Phoenix (tucked between Downtown dining stallwarts The Hero Factory and Z Pizza) today and it was packed! While I kept it light with the spring rolls--extremely fresh and they use the clear white paper I like so much--folks sitting around me were enjoying the tofu with vegetables, vermicelli, and classic beef pho bowl. Despite being overwhelmed by first-day traffic, the servers and kitchen did a great job getting the food out hot and fast. Great job!  Owners Jenny and Tom Nguyen are the nicest people you'll ever meet so I do urge you to give them a try. You won't regret it.  I'm excited for the Downtown location to be unlocked so I can start checking in once or twice a week."}
{"text":"Mi Quang was nasty...tasteless.  Could only eat 25% of it.  Banh Beo was gross....way too soggy."}
{"text":"My house was soooo cold so I decided to go here after my first class because I was so hungry, I needed some noodle soup in my system to warm me up. Yeah, I know I live in Arizona. SO?  I guess I went in when it was slow because I was seated as soon as I walked in, the girl waiting on me was ultra work efficient, took my order, got me my drink and before I knew it BAM. Hot steaming bowl of Pho Dac Biet in front of me. I dug right in an decimated that pho bowl.  It was good, and hit the spot. I just wish there was more tendon in the pho, but I'll have to ask if they can just make me a Pho Tai Gan. Coz that's my favorite! And then I'll give them their 5th star. :)  I didn't have too many complaints because I just wanted to be fed and left alone and give me my check when I'm done eating. And they did a good job on their part! I'll be here more often and bringing my family here too. I'm glad there's a vietnamese restaurant closer to my house! Now I won't have to drive 30-45 minutes to other restaurants to get some yummy vietnamese food. Yaaay!   Can't wait for round 2~  EDIT:  They do make Pho Tai Gan! You just have to ask for it! :)"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch about 2x a month. I walk in, and as i am sitting down, i ask for my Pho with brisket. Set my stuff down, go wash my hands, and when i come back to the table, i may wait another 2 minutes before my favorite soup is in front of me!  I love their efficiency and quality of food!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here. Not too hungry, so we shared 2 Spring Rolls ($3.75) and one dish, My Nam (4F, $7.50), Good thing we weren't hungry, as the dish size was smaller than we expected, but did have 7 shrimps. Spring Rolls were essentially tasteless, as was its peanut sauce. Dish was OK, and the broth (not meant to be a full soup) was excellent. 3rd star earned by an exceptional level of cleanliness. All in all, if you want Vietnamese, there are many others, but this is very convenient. Many more better choices"}
{"text":"Great spot, totally met my expectations. Clean and nice, with a very friendly staff. Food and drinks came out VERY promptly.  I had a half-order of Vietnamese Spring rolls.  They were very good. Also had a rice dish with charbroiled steak. Healthy and tasty.  Everyone else was having Pho and I should have tried that.  I will absolutely be back. Thats a tough business and they are doing a great job."}
{"text":"Wow the chicken noodle pho is so fantastic. The best Ive ever had and the staff was so very nice. I ordered it to go and they packaged it so perfectly with the noodles, herbs, etc on the side so you can build it fresh. It was so yummy my 14 year old daughter loved it too"}
{"text":"Service was not so great,  but could be because they were busy.   Spring rolls were great, but vermicelli lacked flavor.   It is a clean place and easy to find."}
{"text":"Reading these many reviews we walked into here. Stir fry was great! Pho in veggie broth did not work for our taste buds. They did not have extra silver ware, asked for knife to slim down the chunky chicken n veggies in our stir-fry and they had none. Was getting messy. Overall, okay experience."}
{"text":"Viet Kitchen is conveniently located at 101 & cave creek road next to Costco. We ordered couple of pho and jack fruit salad.   Jack fruit salad was interesting. It had nice bite from the bean sprouts and the dressing paired well with the salad.  The actual jack fruit wasn't very ripe so it tasted more like a radish.  The pho is what I really go to Vietnamese restaurants for and this place was disappointing. The broth tasted too artificial and the noodles were over cooked. The tripe in the combo pho had strong gamey taste to it as well.   The staff were friendly and service was prompt. However, the tables were very uncomfortable. The small tables with larger chairs allowed for no leg room unless you sit on the edge of the chair leaning in."}
{"text":"By far some of the best broth which, in my opinion, makes their pho so very delicious. Service is quick, the food is hot and fresh. It's easily accessible and a family favorite."}
{"text":"We are so glad to live less than a mile from Viet Kitchen. Their Pho is wonderful and whenever I try something new, I enjoy it. They have a pretty wide variety of menu items, including some great noodle and stir frys. They have a spicy soup that will clear your sinuses right up and great spring rolls.   The staff is also great, they're friendly and attentive, and always remember a face. Seriously, I don't even need to give my name when I call in as they remember my order (eek!). The prices are also A+ for the size."}
{"text":"Adore this place!  I've eaten there so many times I can't even remember all the dishes I've had. The thing I love about them is that they have been willing to work with my gluten sensitivity. I've never had any reaction from their food!   Usually I order to go. Once they did mess up our order, however, we were too starving to drive back and correct it.   When I dined in the service one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sit down Vietnamese restaurant in town.  It's always sharp and clean.  The staff is always kind to us (and we have a wheelchaired daughter) The owner seems to remember everything about us.  It feels welcoming.  There aren't very many places you can get the crepe appetizer...it's really good!  This is our hands down fav for the soup broth!"}
{"text":"The Pho here is great. I've only had the vegetarian Pho,  but the broth is by far one of the best I've had. The servers aren't very polite and they don't give you the option to put coconut milk in the Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I always order the chicken pho and the spicy stir fry. Never disappointed. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I just ordered bbq chicken and spring rolls for take out. The bbq chicken was ok but vermicelli noodles were super bland, blasé, no taste, side salad had old pieces of lettuce and no dressing, this place had crappy food, not sure I would ever go back again!! Not sure who would give this place more than 1 star, food was pretty blahhhhhh!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I think their pho is pho-bulous.  They use more ginger than some places, which I love. I also like taking half my meal home because of the large portion size. Two of us had lunch for under $20 and the service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Had the 3B Pho Taj and B1 Spring Rolls. The Pho was the best I've had in Phoenix. Best quality meat and lots of it. Super fresh herbs and big sprouts. At $8.25 a bowl is more expensive than may pho places in the valley, but you can see the extra cost goes into the ingredients. The spring rolls were good too, but the pho was da bomb."}
{"text":"Pho-king awesome! Good price, fast service, never been disappointed. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"NOM NOM viet cuisine in the D-Town! Rep Rep!  Pho Bo: Broth had a nice sodium balance, not too sweet or salty.  My usual is Steak + Meatballs.  The steak was well done as oppose to rare, which I prefer.  Meatball was fine.  Banh Mi: A second visit I had an order of this.  The baguette tasted fresh and chewy.  Unlike most pate's, VK meshed it with light soy sauce, which did not bother me too much as it helped bring out the cold meat filling and veggies.  Egg Rolls: No complaint here, Crispy shell and good filling.  Conclusion: The decor is very modern, seems to be the trend here in PHX among Pho places.  Its quite refreshing to see many office dwellers consume Viet food here, actually.  More to try next time, VK has easily made it into my Lunch Rotation thanks to its centralized location."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Viet Kitchen as long as it first opened. I don't like to write novels, so here's the gist of it.  Their egg rolls are pretty darn good.  Fried and crisp to perfection.  Their bun cha gio thit nuong is also really good and very refreshing for a hot day.  Their pho tai gan sach is good, also. Not really a dish on the menu, but definitely not something hard for them to put together.   Their service is pretty awesome.  Considering most Asian restaurants have rude staff that don't speak English very well, this establishment has very friendly people working here.  They'll answer any questions you have and actually come back to check on you and refill your drinks without you having to ask."}
{"text":"What a lovely afternoon with fine folks and good food. Viet Kitchen is an aesthetically pleasing restaurant with very friendly staff members and good food. My meal was delicious. I had the Stir Fry--(7A) on the menu. We all shared an order of Spring Rolls.   The only thing strange was that our food all came out at different times instead of all at once. Since it was only a minute or two apart l am okay with it I suppose. Maybe this is how they do it here. That might be an issue for some old school service folks so a heads up. At this location all the staff members chip in so the food was delivered by different servers when it came up. I am okay with that since I like hot, and not sitting until the server can get to it, meal deliveries. I only mention it because I know some folks might be bothered by that. To be honest I like places that group serve. In my opinion it makes the service, and food temperature, better.   I found the staff here to be absolutely wonderful. They fawned all over us from the moment we walked in until the very end of the day when I went back in to use the bathroom. Even after all the customers had left the restaurant and the staff were eating their lunch. They did not act put out that I returned after about 15 minutes. Such nice people. They were very accommodating, nice, helpful, made good suggestion, were always smiling and very friendly.   All in all, I had a great afternoon with precious friends."}
{"text":"So delicious and whoever the sweet lady is who took my Togo order was on her game!! She even asked if I had any allergies! Unreal service! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. I would love it if they had meat that was less fatty. The service is great and the menu is vast. It is more authentic Vietnamese food than most. I had their chicken pho soup and it was pretty good. I had their pork vermicelli and it was okay. Their BBQ chicken with noodles was the best dish I've had there yet. I really liked the small noodles, delicious! I'll def come back for the BBQ noodles chicken with vegetable. Coconut boba was wonderful!"}
