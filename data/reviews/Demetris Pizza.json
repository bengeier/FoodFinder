{"text":"This place is on my way home from work and has been a staple for us on Friday after work. I call ahead before I leave work; it's ready when I get there to pick it up. For those of you that remember what the sauce from Athena pizza in Banff USED to taste like (my all time fav), this is a close as I've ever had. We've tried several varieties, but have settled in on a 'build your own'. They have not disappointed yet. Yes, it's pricier than some, but it's a great value."}
{"text":"For people who understand pizza. Faux-smarts 'foodies' may attempt to sneer at this, and I don't care. Peeps in the 'hood understand how tasty and filling this pizza is.  No apologetics on the crust. Good sauce (fennel?). The 'types' are well chosen. The Red Sea is a simple blend based around tomato and red pepper. The exploded garlic does that. The Midnight spex and the Kensington spex are neighbourhood default settings. 
     If you're going to meal-out on pizza, this is the 'blue-chip' pizza stock to invest in. Good family run business. They will fill you up in a manner which tastes good on the way down. Choose the movies you watch while eating this carefully!
Love it."}
{"text":"Good pie, large is only 12\" so XL seems like it compares to what I'd expect as a large.  Family run business."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try out Demetris Pizza. Too bad it took us to long to try it because it is literally two blocks from our place!

Really tasty Greek-style pizza. We got the Alberta BBQ steak pizza to go, and it was delicious. They don't skimp out on the meat - which is great for those cozy movie nights at home when you want a nice substantial pizza to pig out on.

They have a menu with a lot of variety so looking forward to trying more from Demetris Pizza!"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza in what I've always called 'steak house style' (because I don't know much about pizza).  I'll get it again sometime for sure, but the price is getting up there if you just want one and want it delivered (currently for a ten inch: $15 + $5 delivery fee + tip).  Picking up and ordering two at a time ($26) is probably the way to go."}
{"text":"If you like substantial Western Canadian Greek-style pizza, then you're going to love Demetris.  This place offers some very good pan pizza."}
{"text":"Kensington's family operated-pizza joint puts out some tasty pie!

When I'm looking to feed some friends, Demetris is my go-to party pizza, and they do it up Canadian style - thick, heavy, full of cheese and full of flavour! 

If Ninja Turtles taught me anything, it's that nobody can agree on the best pizza toppings, so to help us all out, Demetris has got a pretty decent selection. You can keep to the traditional Pepperoni or Hawaiian, or play it pizza fashion forward with the artichoke and chicken \"Affair of the 'Heart'\" or the \"Alberta BBQ Steak.\"

The sauce is...saucy, and tangy, and the crust is good and crunchy without being dry. 

Demetris price is definitely on the high end when it comes to take out pizza, but I'll keep coming back because they've been deliciously consistent with every order."}
{"text":"Their pizza is pretty tasty (we had mushroom, tomato, onion, garlic, feta), but the large is small and it is pretty greasy.  Also, beware of getting the matriarch (?) on the phone.  When our order arrived, it was only 1 pizza instead of the 2 that we ordered.  When I called to find out how quickly they could get us the second pizza, she replied immediately \"okay, we can send you another, but you'll have to pay the delivery fee again.\"  The $7 delivery fee??  \"I was the one who took your order, and I know I couldn't have been wrong.\"  Wrong answer.  Now we're back on the hunt for a decent pizza delivery place..."}
{"text":"Their hours are limited and service is brusque, but they make very tasty pizza with quality ingredients. Delicious and unique topping combinations. - Affair of the Heart is my go-to."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious! I've never seen so much cheese! Had the Garlic Lover's Delight (added chicken) as take out, and as a definite garlic lover, it didn't let me down. Pricing is what I'd expect to pay for the quality, especially if you go for the 2-for-X deals that they do. 
Would eat again, and can't wait to do so!
I really want to give this place 4 and a half stars, simply because the location is not the best. The parking lot was a bit savage on my little Jetta's front bumper. Proceed with caution!"}
{"text":"The pizza at Demetris is amazing!
The love of Paris is my fav! The crust is just perfect and the toppings are divine!"}
{"text":"My wife was out of town for a week so I was a stay-at-home bachelor. Decided I wanted pizza and this place was pretty close by. Settled for the Alberta BBQ steak pizza. It was tasty and flavorful, nothing phenomenal.  I knocked down one star because the crust is too thick, which seems to be common theme in Canada (I'm from East Coast USA so I'd rather have thin crispy crust, not Chicago deep-dish).  I also knocked down a star because I called ahead and ordered, but when I arrived they had no idea who I was and had to wait from scratch. Note they do NOT have any space to eat here except for one tiny, 2-seat table."}
{"text":"My favourite neighbourhood takeout pizza! Lots of great vegetarian options. Delicious thick crust and fresh tasting, flavourful toppings. Friendly and appears to be family run. 
The two pizza deals are very reasonable. You need leftovers. 
There are a couple chairs to wait in if you arrive before your pizza is ready, but don't plan to eat here. 
If you want thin crust, don't order from Demetris. Obviously."}
{"text":"I love Demetris Pizza! It's right down the street from my house so it's really convenient for me. Their garlic lovers pizza is amazing. Being a vegetarian, I was super thrilled with all of the options they provide. Funnily enough, I really hate The standard vegetarian pizza so there are options were amazing. If you're looking for a great, thick crust, Greek style pizza, this is the place you're looking for."}
