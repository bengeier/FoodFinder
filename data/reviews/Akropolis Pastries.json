{"text":"Love going there. Best Greek pastries on the Danforth and the service is friendly and perfect. Hard to choose what to eat because everything there is very good. I love their cheese pie and their spanakopita. And the coffee is superb. You feel like you are in Greece."}
{"text":"We made it there for the first time after hanging out in our hood and feeling hungry, but not quite for a heavy lunch. We were welcomed with a smile and the server was very helpful while choosing what we wanted to have. There were so many good-looking things to choose from. Yummy!  We ended up getting spanikopita (flaky spinach pie) with greek salad and baklava. The big piece of the pie was cut into six tiny pieces by a very old-looking cutting tool, as mentioned in the previous posts. The cuts were fast and precise. Salad was flavourful as a good Greek salad is supposed to be with nice amount of oil and olives. Baklava was very sweet and fresh and very delicious.  Since we didn't order any drink, we got complimentary water after we asked.   We immediately fell in love with the food and service, so we expressed ourselves while on our way out and gave a promise to come and try all of the sweet pastries they are offering.   So we have been back there for other variations of baklava with nuts etc, loukoumades, custard pie and some other which names I can't even spell :)  Afternoons and evenings it is pretty quiet there with few old Greek men here and there.  At Greekfest they had a nice booth on the street so there was even no need to go in to get a nice dozen of sugar-dripping honey balls (loukoumades) which came in a nice plastic container to share with friends.  When you are at Pape/Danfroth, step few steps to east to find this treasure."}
{"text":"Excellent cheese and spinach pies on the Danforth. They actually put a lot of feta cheese in their pita  and they are so tasty and well priced. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great pastries, service, and prices. Amazing freshness, the pies and pastries were worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great little pastry place on the outskirts of Greektown on the Danforth. Stopped here this weekend between Irish music workshops and got a spinach pastry. It was delicious and pretty inexpensive. Only $3.50 if my memory serves. It was super flaky and nice and hot!   Recommended"}
{"text":"Wow randomly dropped in here after an appt and picked up finikia and beef pie. The man working there was lovely and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a friendly and homey place. The staffs were so sweet. I tried almost all the salty type of pastries there Tyropita, Spanakopita, Spanakopita. They are so wonderful, fresh and authentic. Then the dessert pastries were great finale. Baklava made with pistachios was fantastic. I highly recommend this place to everyone. Let's all support local Mom and pop shops!"}
{"text":"Greek food is among my favorite style of food. Akropolis is a very good place to go for that, I really like the Lamb Gyros, the Greek salad, and the pita bread. I have had a lot of items of the menu here but I always get at least 1 of the three mentions things above as they are my favorite.  The only thing I did not like was the Greek style coffee, I don't think they do coffee right. However, they do everything else really good.   I always enjoy visiting Akropolis as I am a huge fan of the big Greek appetite, they seem to eat a lot, or is it just me? In any case love the food, love the place, and like the friendly staff.   #30daysofyelp"}
{"text":"Ever since the first time I sat down at this small cafe in Greektown I've returned whenever I can to get my fix of some Greek pies and pasteries. My recent trip was about a week ago and I wanted to hang out here before going off to the movies. To pair off with my coffee, I had a Spanakopita, a Finikia and a Kataifi which something very new to me. If you are eating at the cafe, the two desserts come heavily doused in honey or some sort of sweet dessert which really increases the sweetness of them. But they both tasted so good and the inside of finikia also was soaked with maybe the same syrup which made is delectably chewy. The kataifi also tasted interesting especially when I bit down into the noodle center.  Akropolis has become my preferred spot to head to whenever I'm in Greektown, so much so that the second time I headed here was to get some spanakopita and a box of Melamakarona for a friend's pot-luck birth party. Both of them were a hit. And for the first, I was here, I had the spanakopita and took home a melamakarona which I fell in love with instantly and that's how I decided to get some for the birthday feast. The next time I'm finally going to try out the loukoumades and a baklava ;-)"}
{"text":"Popped in here around lunchtime today to grab a quick bite to eat. This place was hopping for noon on a Wednesday! I didn't sit, but they had quite a few tables filled. I stayed away from the sweets today, of which they had a vast array. It was quite a wonderful display and very tempting. No, today I wanted something savoury, so I opted for the spanakopita; always a safe bet. The service was friendly and attentive, and the price was right. I always long for more spinach & feta filling and less dough, but this spinach pie was pretty righteous. I only wish I had bought two pieces instead of one."}
{"text":"I can't get over how delicious their spanakopita is!! I can eat a whole tray to myself, no joke! The service is always, I mean always, lovely. The owners truly care about their customers and I've repeatedly had great banter with the owners.   Best pastries on the block"}
{"text":"Since my original review I've been back to Akropolis a couple times to check if I just got a bad batch of loukoumades. I didn't. Both the texture and taste are totally off. On my most recent visit the outer shell was a little more crispy, which was nice. The taste, though, just isn't cutting it. They're almost inedible compared to Athen's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/athens-pastries-pies-toronto).  The tiropita really is excellent though. The filling in particular is at least as good as Athen's.  Akropolis also has several different types of baklava. Various shapes, some with walnuts, some with pistachios, some with both. I had a triangular piece of baklava with walnuts. The flavour is nice and it had a good amount of walnuts but it could have been a little more tender in the middle"}
{"text":"Superb Tyropita (cheese pie), made of course, with hand-rolled phyllo. This one a little more buttery than the last few I've sampled, some might say a little on the greasy side, but I certainly prefer it over the too-dry variety.  They also feature the spinach and custard-filled types, as well as a number of other traditional dishes. The interior has the familiar scenes painted from the old country on the walls, and a more spacious dining area than a lot of similar establishments.  Akropolis also offers their own brand of ready-made phyllo dough- from what I gather, they even sell the buttered layers already assembled to simply add your own filling at home. They seem to have a thriving commercial sector to their business, and it's easy to see why. Next time, I'm totally going for the rolled-and-twisted into a swirl version. I think it might change my life."}
{"text":"OMG!   SERIOUSLY!!  OMG!   Got some baklava....and extra honey syrup...they have a jug of it, because enough people must ask!!  And get 6, it lasts forever, and it's yummy!  And.  It's DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM VON donuts... 2 birds, anyone??!!  And I also bought 1 Finikia...I forget what it is, but it was incredible!!   And.   They also serve food!  I was told that Greek coffee is supposed to be awesome.   I don't typically drink coffee... I love the flavour in things, but I use way tooo much sugar when I drink coffee, typically.   Guess I'll have to try it!   So.   The lovely server gave me free honey balls with cinnamon!   OMG.   Never had them before. WILL DEFINITELY ORDER THEM THE NEXT TIME.   Between this place, VON, and Athens, I REALLY AM GONNA LIVE IN GREEK TOWN!!!!   Also she gave me an awesome sample of savoury pastries with  phyllo dough...... OMG!  AGAIN! SERIOUSLY!  FOLKS!   They were DEFINITELY NOT your typical spanakopita either.     I'M DEFINITELY COMING back here.   Pick up appetizers.   Honey balls.  WITH CINNAMON.   Always ask for the cinnamon!!!  And, Baklava and Finikia!!   Yum  Yum  Yum  Yummmmmmmy!"}
