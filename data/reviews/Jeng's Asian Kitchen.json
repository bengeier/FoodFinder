{"text":"Delicious food!  I had Hunan Tofu with fried rice.  The sauce was really good, and the tofu was perfectly prepared.  My husband had the Jeng's Chicken and really enjoyed his too.  We also tried the wontons and veggie egg rolls which were also really good.  The staff was also really friendly.  Glad such a good place opened so close to home!"}
{"text":"A very welcome addition to Monona and a good showing for a soft open. Excellent, fast service. Good space.  Very good food, particularly considering the price point. I had the Mongolian Stir Fry beef and it was my favorite dish at the table. I asked for spicy level 3 and it was exactly what I expected - plenty of kick without overwhelming the dish's flavor. I also thought the hot & sour soup was excellent - eggy, the way I like it. The thai coconut curry was solid but a little underwhelming after I'd eaten the Mongolia dish. I think it could have actually used more curry. We also had the jeng's chicken, which quite simply is not my thing, but the party who ordered it was a big fan. It was ordered as mild as possible and jeng's met that request. We were pleased by the range of spiciness levels available. In short, a good experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here around 8:15, it was very quiet. I placed my order to go, stood by the side to wait. In less than two minutes the friendly lady who took my order brought my hot and fresh food right to me. I had the small plate of mixed veggies with tofu. I chose the brown rice to go with it and there was a nice size mound of it. I could have done with a few more veggies but it was a pretty good portion for the price (less than $7). I'd like to come back and try out the other dishes!"}
{"text":"I agree with others on here. The food is way, way, way too sweet. My kung pao beef was almost inedible. I'll probably try them again, because most places deserve more than one chance, but my first try was not good.
On the plus side, their hot and sour soup is delicious, probably the second best in town behind Tom's Red Pepper.
The 'signature egg roll' was pretty good, if a little greasy. The scary orange/ pink sauce mostly added more sweetness, which I didn't need.
The staff was nice, my takeout order came quickly and correctly, and the place seemed like a pleasant enough room for dine-in.
And, if the entree had been better, it was a good deal, in terms of portions and value."}
{"text":"I had Jeng's bookmarked for a while and wanted to make it before they closed permanently.

The ordering system and menu is akin to Chin's Asia Fresh. There are stir fry dishes, noodle dishes, and accompanying meats/veggies to choose from as well as different sauces. There are a handful of appetizer and soups too.

We got the Jeng's chicken and hot and sour soup. The Jeng's chicken is the saucier and much skinnier version of the traditional Americanized General Tso's chicken. The breading is much lighter, chicken is much crispier, and the sauce has a little more tang. 

The other reviews mentioning that there is too much sauce. Why is that a bad thing? That's just more goodness to mix your rice with! I could have used more sauce!

The hot and sour soup was piping hot even after a 20 min drive home. I really liked the soup, it's one of the better ones out there. There is no over-starched goop in it, you know what I'm talking about. The soup is light and the ingredients were cut up in bite sized pieces. 

I'm sad that I was so late to the party. This place has great potential and couldn't easily been on our regular rotation. I wish the owners luck in their new endeavor."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the food looks beautiful and is fresh and gets the stars. But, I got the kung pao chicken and it was so sweet I almost just left it after the first few bites. There was so much sugar in the sauce it was actually sticky.

I suppose there may people who would like it but if there is one dish that should not be sweet, it is kung pao chicken."}
{"text":"These guys are going to end up with a 5 from me, I can already tell.  Important to point out, they're very clear about this being a soft open, and that they want to use this period to hear from people and I totally respect that.  And so far, so good, with just a few thoughts on improvement, hence this is longer than my usual reviews, I'm guessing the owners are reading these. 

The staff (owners?) are really great.  They're attentive, knowledgeable about the food, and they totally want you to enjoy yourself.  The space is really well done, very clean, very upbeat, but also really bright at night. Maybe tone down the overhead lights or consider some softer light options, which will also compliment the color choices, which are really nice.

Now the food.  We started with cream cheese wontons, absolutely the best I've had.  Not greasy and not salty, which was a nice surprise.  Next the hot and sour soup - seriously order this, it was awesome.  Super fresh, nice sour/hot balance, again not salty.  My wife had the Thai Coconut Curry with tofu, and my daughter had the Pad Thai with chicken.  Both were a little weak on curry flavor, the pad thai could have used more sauce, the noodles drank it fast, and more tamarind would hit that tart edge harder too.  The red curry needed more curry - and maybe less carrot, more veggie variety.  My wife ordered it mild, and she felt it was perfect, but the flavor profile could be boosted more.  That said, both dishes featured very fresh ingredients, crisp veggies, the tofu and the chicken were both cooked perfectly.

And, best for last, the Hunan BBQ Stir Fry with chicken was amazing.  I think I said 'damn' at least four times while eating, and all in a good way.  I ordered it a three, the hottest, I LOVE hot food, this was hot.  As in, my wife said 'whoa, you're sweating, you never sweat.' I salute you, this was truly spicy, just like it says.  And I'm totally getting everything spicy from now on.

So, go, try this place, locally owned, really nice people, and excellent food."}
{"text":"From the moment my wife showed me the Host Madison. Com article with a picture of the \"Wild Mongolian\" dish with tofu, I knew I had a rendezvous with fate to give \"Jeng's Asian Kitchen\" a shot.  I was not disappointed.

Will Roger's said \"You will never get a second chance to make a first impression\"  Jeng's Asian Kitchen knocked my first impression out of the park!

Pulling up I  found plenty of parking.  The building is bright and well lit.  Walking in the front door you will first notice a large detailed menu that is clean, clear and easy to read. Two easy step ordering process. 1) Choose your Wok'd Entree  2) Pick your Size and Protein options ( Chicken, Beef, Shrimp or Tofu) 

Before you get even part way through the menu selections, your attention will be distracted by the incredible sensory overload of mouth watering smells coming from the kitchen.  As you turn your head to try to determine where those heavenly smells were coming from you will notice an extremely clean and organized dining room.  Many small tables very well appointed with all your dining needs Chopsticks Utensils, napkins.  

The small staff who are mostly behind the scenes were all very friendly and engaging.  Every effort is made to make sure that your order is correct and to your specifications.  As I waited for my order to be prepared, I walked around the dining room, still in awe how clean and neat everything was.  Near the soda dispenser, there were takeout containers, Siracha & Soy sauce, 

I ordered the regular sized \"Wild Mongolian\" with Tofu & plain fried rice to go, and it was delivered to me timely and with a smile. 

The ride home was nearly unbeatable due to the fantastically phenomenal smells emanating from the carryout container... 

All the anticipation was well worth the wait.  The \" Wild Mongolian\" with tofu is an exceptional dish!  The sauce was mildly spicy, with rich complex flavors. The vegetables and Tofu were cooked to perfection.  The plan fried rice was well seasoned, and not heavy or laden with grease.  If Jeng's Asian Kitchen can create a vegetarian dish as great as this, I know that my carnivorous won't be disappointed when they add their favorite protein of choice to any one of these dishes.

Congratulations Jeng's Asian Kitchen, you have made an excellent first impression, and have earned a new loyal customer!

But don't just take my word for it.,. Try Jeng's Asian Kitchen for yourself... You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best quick convenient food restaurants in the area. The interior was very clean, smelled good, furniture new, music level right for conversation, and the service very pleasant.

I had the Mongolian beef which was the best I've had in Madison, (though I prefer a more salty version). You can choose between a regular portion or upgrade to a larger portion for two dollars-really nice. Great selection of healthyish NantucketNectars-peach! 

They have been open for a month it obviously this is not their first restaurant attempt. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I am basing this review on one visit.  The cream cheese wontons were just okay.  The pad thai was unlike any pad thai I've ever had.  It was lacking flavor and the entire dish had an orange color.  I found that weird.  I assume it was some spice that did that.  It really did not taste like pad thai, but it wasn't terrible.  I would like to try one of the stir fry dishes they offer.  Hopefully those sauces have more flavor."}
{"text":"First try. As others have noted, it is a minimal service restaurant. On entry, you have a menu board offering choices for wok stir fries, noodles and hibachi grills. Chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu. Order then sit down, they bring the food to you. Everything is \"Asian\" inspired, if not exactly dishes you would find if you were IN Asia. But guess what? It's good! Jeng's Chicken, a riff on General Tso's, was fresh and hot and tasty. There are other choices like a red curry stir fry, a \"mongolian\" stir fry and a kung-pao or hunan style. Noodles look to be of the pad thai rice noodle style or the lo-mein style. No Ramen here! Best of all? Those pork egg rolls everyone talks about. Crisp. Hot. SUPER flavorful, almost smoky. Comes with a sugary dipping sauce, but do yourself a favor and grab a bottle of soy sauce along with the Sriracha Sauce and make your own. No tipping, and they buss the table. I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of saucier Americanized Asian food, you will love Jengs. We ordered the cream cheese wontons, egg rolls, Jengs chicken, spicy Kung Pao and steak and shrimp hibachi. Let's start with the hibachi. When I hear that word I envision clean tastes with minor sauce. Let the grill add the flavor. This hibachi was tasteless and came with an odd cream sauce. We asked that the Kung Pao be extra spicy and to give them credit, they did that justice. But it seems like they  also heard extra saucy because it definitely was...saucy, sweet and spicy and not in a good way. Jengs chicken was the best entree akin to a General Tsos. Not bad. The cream filled wontons aka crab rangoons were sugar bombs. I can't imagine eating one dipped in duck sauce. I might have needed an insulin shot. The egg rolls were in a word FABULOUS. The best I have ever eaten. If it was socially acceptable, I would order a plate of those and call me satisfied. I am a little disappointed since we love to support local restaurants. I think we might try again and hope for more savory dishes. Just in case, I'm ordering extra egg rolls."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, larger portions. Egg rolls were good, tad greasy, but better then average. Would order from here again."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Its clean, open, and comfortable, and is GOOD Asian food in Monona (China Star and Taste of China are poor substitutes). The staff is friendly and fast, and the food is tasty. This will be my \"I don't feel like cooking\" go to spot."}
{"text":"The worst kind of pseudo-Asian food with sticky-sweet sauces and overcooked rice.  Everything is deep fried.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"My fiance and I just went out to lunch at Jeng's today. Overall, our experience was very good! The staff is so friendly, the service is prompt and the space is comfortable and well lit. 

On to the food! 

I had the Mongolian BBQ Chicken with medium spice (2 out of 3) and brown rice. It was very good, not greasy and the ingredients were high quality and fresh. I'm very picky about chicken so this is a huge compliment. 

My fiance had Jeng's Chicken medium spice (2) and brown rice. Wow, this was delicious. The chicken was crispy without being greasy and the sauce was sweet, tangy and spicy. Yum. I was eating off of his plate, too. 

We also ordered the signature egg rolls. They were good and ingredients fresh but lacked a little flavor. The description said they had pork in them and I could only find veggies, egg and noodles in ours. We asked them thinking we had been given veggie spring rolls on accident and they said those were the right ones. The girl working the register reordered them again for us on the house and said she told the cooks about how they might need some more pork. Our second batch had noticeable pork and were good so we were happy and I appreciated them fixing the issue politely. 

Overall, this place has really great food and the prices are fair. The quality out matches any other asian food place that I've eaten at in this area. We plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago with a buddy. Nice little place, nothing too special or fancy. More decorations on the walls would probably provide more ambiance, but it is better than going to the loud and noisy mall food court to get something similar from Sarku.

Which is essentially all this is. However, from the taste, I'd put it it a step above Sarku. The setup is similar to Noodles & Company, where you order at the counter and they prepare it fresh and bring it out to you. Filled me up and I didn't experience any gastric distress afterwards, so makes it a decent fast-casual place in my opinion. Nice addition to Monona where fast food means crap food and casual usually means full service sit-down. Plus, kind of nice for single, childless persons such as myself who want Mongolian beef, but don't want to order a whole quart container worth to be eating over the course of three days."}
{"text":"Got take out from here last week. 

Nothing special. I would put it one notch above your typical Chinese take out.... 

My food was hot and cooked ok, but it was kind of blah to be honest. Will I try it again? Sure... But only because I love shitty Chinese take out...don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"I was on a road trip heading back to Pittsburgh and pulled off the highway to get gas.  Passed this restaurant and decided to give it a try.

It was close to 9 and we were afraid they were going to tell us that they were closed.  Instead they invited us in and made us an amazing meal.  The staff was really helpful in describing the menu items and all the food was made from scratch.

I wish that I lived nearby so that I could go back and try other items on the menu.

You should definitely stop by and support this local gem."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this place to open for some time. Went there for dinner last night after basketball practice for our kid, then after the basketball game today.

First off, the staff are amazing and friendly and aim to please. You order at the counter from a limited (but very diverse) menu and they bring it to your table, fresh and hot. Here's a list of what I really like:

1. Real plates, not ones that end up in the garbage after a meal.
2. The menu, while relatively small, is very well done. I like that you can order a small (which ought to be enough for anybody) or a regular portion if you'd like.
3. The fact they have Hmong rolls. If you haven't had a Hmong roll, make it a point to order one here. Ask for the Signature Egg roll.
4. You can choose a heat for your food 1-3, with 3 being very spicy. 
5. The veggies are crisp and very fresh in every dish. Yes, please!

I had the Stir Fried Noodles with Tofu. The little tofu blocks were perfectly prepared--chewy on the outside and soft on the inside and they held the flavors nicely. You won't miss the meat.

For the second time around, I went with an orange-ginger chicken dish. Again, quite good with lovely flavors and bursts of a candied ginger flavor. Yum. 

This is clearly becoming our quick go-to Asian-fusiony kind of place."}
{"text":"Great new spot in Monona! My husband and I have stopped here several times and have never been disappointed! I have tried multiple dishes and each are delicious. The staff are great at helping you order the right amount of spiciness for your dish. The Ginger Glazed Chicken, Jeng's Chicken and Hunan BBQ Stir-Fry were all good, we can't wait to try more. The portions are decent, we always have leftovers to eat again later.  Also the cream cheese wontons are similar to crab rangoon, these are yummy too! This is a great spot to stop and pick up take out on your way home or dine in if you would like!!"}
{"text":"Three of us ordered different dishes and shared tastes.  What stood out:

 *   You order at the counter and it is brought to your table;  so it's a minimal-service place but the staff are highly engaged, attentive, and want to make the best of your experience;  one cashier/server, and multiple cooks in view behind the counter area - - interesting constellation.

 *  The dining area is just a small step above fast-food style, but clean and fresh;  not a true\"dinner\" experience but not too shabby either.

 *   What impresses is solid mastery of ingredients in the kitchen - - the vegetables are fresh, toothy, lively, colorful, well prepared;  everything on the plate is appealing - - all in all, very good product and attention to detail in preparation and presentation,

 *  For me, if there is a drawback, it is that the main dish components all have a sweet/oily glaze - - in some ways this is a well-created cuisine-specific accomplishment, and in other ways it can be a bit cloying - - it depends upon your tastes.  For me, ultimately,  the dishes are prepared conscientiously and with precision and success, but the style is less lush and flavorfully zaftig as it is glossy/glaze fine - -  for me, it is excellence in execution, but not totally satisfying in terms of Asian flavor-spectrum glory.

 *   The Madison Review Crew company was really delightful, and sharing portions of the different dishes was really worthwhile.

 *   Ultimately,  the price/quality ratio is very,very high;  if this is the style of food you are craving, you will get a very top rendition.   The staff contribute to a very positive experience."}
