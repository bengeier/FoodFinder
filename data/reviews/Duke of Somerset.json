{"text":"They aren't kidding with \"Spicy\" Indonesian Nasi Goreng!! Real red chillies. Try not to eat'em like veggies.... unless u want to challenge urself!"}
{"text":"As I work across the street and live close by, it's sort of my local pub when we're too lazy to go anywhere else.  Staff are nice, though there seems to have been a big turnover of staff.  When we first started going to this pub -- in 2009 -- the food was great pub food.  Good portions, nicely cooked.  It has been going downhill in quality.  I ordered sweet potato fries -- just had a glass of wine and sweet potato fries when meeting a friend on a weekend afternoon -- and there were seriously about 15 fries in this teeny, tiny basket.  I asked if I had been given the child-size, and the waitress said no, this was the only size.  Uh...no."}
{"text":"Former Pub has been re-fitted and is part of the \"Duke\" chain of Pubs. Has street-side patio for people watching. Friendly wait staff. Pub food is okay."}
{"text":"Hands down best fish & chips I had...even better than The Olde Yorke which we took a cab to try. Bartenders are nice and know their cocktails...well at least Steve did! calamari with jalapeno dipping sauce was delicious too!"}
{"text":"Daily specials give you good value.  The prices and food are fair, and the beer on tap is very nicely varied.  Only paid parking available since it's downtown though."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this English-themed pub in the middle of Toronto serves such a nice Moroccan vegetable stew, but it's really worth trying. And if you buy a tower of onion rings they'll donate a buck to the SickKids Foundation. (Now THAT sounds more like an English pub.)"}
{"text":"Went for the first time to see an old friend back in the early summer.  Did not like it at all!  Chairs/benches are not comfortable for adults (unless they are child-sized).  Upholstery was old and worn and I felt like I needed to bathe after sitting on it.  The whole feel of the interior of the restaurant is that of a tired old university pub.    The patio looked lovely enough - but I didn't venture outside.  Service was severely lacking.  There appeared to be 5 or 6 servers hanging about - but it took over 15 minutes to get the attention of someone in order to get a drink.  I ordered their mini burgers with fries.  Very disappointing.  Very dry, and over cooked, ratio of beef to bread was not suitable.  Almost no topping under the bun.  I would not waste a penny of my money by every going back here.  With so many other options to choose from with better prices and food - I will always go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I guess the small piece of fish last time was a fluke.   Amanda, the Duke of Somerset marketing manager, responded to my previous Yelp review and let me know that the portion was unusually small. She got in touch with the restaurant and made sure they corrected that issue.  When I revisited this past week, I was not disappointed. The fish was double the size of the one I had last time, at least in width, and the angle of the picture doesn't do it justice. Just like last time, it was fried nicely. The batter is not overly thick, so you get the perfect amount of crunch with the fish. I still wish there were more fries and that they'd be on the plate instead of a container, just to give it that hearty full-plate look. But I was very pleased with my visit overall.  My server, Kate, was very friendly and attentive.   It's not cheap, but if you want good fish and chips around the Bay and Gerard area, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tldr: good drinks, terrible food, okay service  It's apparently a chain, it's got the same menu as duke of York up on prince Arthur. I ordered the woo woo or woohoo? Some sort of cocktail, it tasted like a cosmo, but better. I also ordered some sort of chicken curry dish. There were more potatoes in the curry than curry, with a side of rice I barely finished half of the dish."}
{"text":"The restaurant offers both interior and exterior option before you take a sit. The sitting at outside is so cool to chill with your friends while you're drinking your beer, wine, whiskey or vodka whichever you consume as an alcohol. The interior design is sort of dark illuminated which I did not quite have chance to observe because I sat outside.   It looks like a typical British pub where place is surrounded by UK flag mostly. They offer variety of beers and other type of liquor, however beer is more common than any other liquors. The restaurant is also very suitable for sport games where you can watch the game with your fellas on television or maybe you'll end up with a conflict who knows ?   Beside than that, food that they offer unfortunately do not consist of range. In fact, foods are pretty limited compare to other restaurants. Taste of food is averagely good. Y'know normal type of pub food.   Verdict: 7.5/10. Definitely recommended but do not go there with high expectations."}
{"text":"Very much a generic bar, nothing I can point to that is wrong with it but nothing that stands out either except for an inviting group setting inside.  Came here with a group of around 30 people, and they made a mistake in having our reserved spots in an area that was not convenient, and as a result a small portion had to be split up. For our troubles, management provided all of us a free shot and an appetizer platter, which I feel more than makes up for the fact that 6 of our group had to go sit at the next table over (Mind you the organizer did have to go make some hassle for that to happen).  Our waitress was very friendly and was never too far away to serve us.   I ordered a burger and it was nothing spectacular at all and for $7.50 I would have liked to get a bit more out of that.  Their beer selection is nothing much to write home about, they have Fuller's London Pride as they are an English pub, but that's nothing you can't find at other locations anyway.  If you're in the area, use the Yelp app to maybe look for a better place if not I would recommend this place for a solid time of drinking!"}
{"text":"Having worked so closely to this pub the last 5 years, I finally decided to try out this bar. Came here on a cold Friday afternoon with a friend for a quick lunch. We were seated immediately as the restaurant was not busy. The restaurant is huge and offers many tables and booths.   My friend and I decided to share their signature Fish and Chips and boy was it a great idea, the portions were massive! The fish was tasty and juicy, however, it was a bit greasy. The meal came with side order of fries and coleslaw (which was a bit bland and watery). It also happened to be Fish and Chips Friday meaning that aside from their signature Fish and Chips, they also served other types that are not usually offered on other days of the week.   The service was pretty decent as our waitress was friendly and helpful when taking our orders. The manager also came by to ask how our meal was which was unexpected but nice.  Prices were a bit higher than the usual bar prices.  Overall, pretty decent place, I'll definitely stumble here again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Food was okay but service was really slow though they were all friendly. We eventually got up to find our waiter to pay our bill. I'd probably come back here to sit on the outdoor patio but mostly only because it's a convenient location."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were ok both times I went. Service isn't much better either."}
{"text":"It's typical of any Dukes, any pub.  It's pretty large, located in a convenient location - Bay/Elm and they do have Trivia nights on Tuesday!  My friend and I just sat at the bar for a drink while waiting for an event to start nearby.  I have to say - their drink prices are one of the cheapest that I have seen - my drink was $8.  And it was a decent pour...not some tiny glass.  Considering the area they certainly could charge more!  I can't comment on the food as I haven't tried any, but I'm sure I will as I will be back for trivia nights.  The servers were super friendly - I can only imagine how packed this place must get later in the evening.    Should this place be the resurrection of cheap pours, sticky floors??!"}
{"text":"Friendly servers, cozy tables and decent fish and chips. During the summer time there's also a patio out front and for corporate and birthdays or landmark occasions the dining room offers more than adequate space.   Beer prices are good. Surprisingly not as busy as other pubs in the area and I don't get why. The bar is clean, seating comfortable and it's not overpriced considering it is on Bay St. Service is quick and friendly, and most food is tasty and the portions are good.  Worth the trip"}
{"text":"Checklist for faux English/Irish Pub in Toronto: 1) Overpriced selection of mediocre beers...check. 2) Selection of fried items that are battered and fried beyond recognition...check. 3) 1980's chain restaurant interior...check. 4) Inconsistent service...check.  I've been here a couple times, most recently to watch a world cup game.  Well, we didn't quite manage to watch it because the one TV on the patio is small and not so conveniently located.    Pitchers of beer are expensive and the selection isn't great.  We got a bunch of their combo \"bites\" or \"snacks\".  I actually thought the shrimp bites were chicken until someone pointed it out to me....that's not a good sign.  Service is inconsistent.  Always friendly but generally slow and unsteady.    Nice patio though."}
{"text":"I'd give this 2.5 stars overall.  DO's: - do go here for a decent beer selection - do come to watch sports with friends on their spacious patio - do come for decent service  DON'Ts: - do not go here for good value for your food. Portions are small, underwhelming in flavour, and overpriced.  All 3 of our orders of burgers were well overcooked (quite stiff to chew) and a bit charred (crunchy black bits on the exterior). At a starting price of $12 for a bare burger, I would expect it to be at least cooked properly.  I made the mistake of upgrading my side of fries to their 'Camden Poutine' for $5. It was basically a handful of lattice fries in a mediocre beef gravy. Cheese was just mozza  (I think) that was melted on nacho-style, definitely not cheese curds, and the supposed bacon bits that it was supposed to have were just little flecks that could barely be seen. Definitely not worth it. In fact, I wouldn't pay for any of the upgrades and just stick with the small cup of fries that comes with your burger.  All 3 of the burger orders were disappointing, although the guacamole seemed to be the least offensive.   The Moroccan stew and chicken pot pie were better tasting, I'd recommend those over the burger.  Overall, I'd say don't come here for the food, save your money for the drinks on the patio."}
{"text":"The food was typical Irish pube fare but nothing special. Our waiter wasn't overly competent however the manager was very accommodating and polite. Overall decent food close to the hospital."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Shortly after spraining my ankle at a concert and Young & Dundas square, I hobbled down to Bay street with my boyfriend looking for somewhere to get some post-concert eats and rest my poor ankle. We came across Duke of Somerset with its nice patio and decided it to check it out as it was a nice night for some patio chillin'!  We were promptly sat in the very large patio area. There are regular tables and some with benches, too! We opted for a bench seat, plopped down, and watched some hockey on one of the outdoor TVs.  Service was very good! Both our server and the manager were very friendly and helpful.  We opted to try some of the small plate/tapas style dishes. Here's what we had:  Sweet Potato Fries with a Maple Dijon Dip: I hate sweet potato fries but my boyfriend loves them! He devoured two servings of them and said they were very good. Nice & crispy on the outside.  Mini Burger & Fries: the fries were decent but the mini burger wasn't anything special. A little doughy on the bread, a little overdone on the meat, and not too much in the way of toppings.  Homemade Sausage Rolls: A-Okay! Nothing to write home about but pretty decent to snack on. I dipped mine in ketchup.   Deep Fried Pickles: I love deep-fried pickles! These were pretty good. Nice breading and not too scalding like some deep fried pickles can be when you bite into them. I dipped mine into some yummy ranch sauce.  Crunchy Nacho Cheese Sticks: Yumyumyumyumyum! These were the favourite for me. They are a really cool spin on the classic mozzarella stick pub fare. These are a cheddar cheese, but coated with a nacho breading. A bite of salsa spice to give it some kick! I am totally a fan!   We also had a small chicken Cesar salad that was okay. Reminded me of something similar that you'd buy at a Sobeys.  Overall it was okay, I don't think I'd actively come back here if it wasn't for the lovely patio and amazing Nacho Cheese Sticks. They were So. Damn. Good. I think I may pop by on a lunch hour at some point and devour some! Yum!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard pub. Nice large patio, and they're willing to take reservations for large groups. I only come here for work drinks though; I don't think I'd choose to come here with friends.  Slightly better than average beer selection, but food that isn't memorable. I've yet to try their Mug Special, but if you bring your own mug on Thursdays, they'll sell you 30 oz. of beer for $6."}
{"text":"The mojito with a twist was great, goat cheese dip was unusual with tomato sauce, goat cheese, garlic and balsamic. Comes with soft bagette and some too-crispy naan chips that were deep-fried. Guacamole burger was good but not worth $16.49. Overall good food and service but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Wow two cups of coffee and a very small portion of fries for $10.70. over priced. I think so. And the service was much to be desired. Will I go back, depends on if I care to have any change at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Went last night for trivia night.  I arrived before my friends and grabbed a drink at the bar.  I started chatting with the bartender and who I think was the manager and they asked if I was meeting someone and I said that I was expecting a large group of people.  They were nice enough to tell me that the trivia area was filling up quickly and let me have the rest of the available tables.  That was much appreciated.  Pretty decent selection of drinks, a little on the pricey side.    Moving on to the food....I ordered a peppercorn burger with fries.  Immediately i could tell the burger was a pre-packed pattie that came in bulk not a homemade pattie based on the shape.  It was overdone and flavorless.  Fries were ok, but definitely nothing special.    Waitress was a little slow on brining drinks at times but it appeared she was the only one serving our section which isn't her fault.    The atmosphere was a little strange, a little too corporate."}
{"text":"Poor slow service - nothing extraordinary about this place . There are better places around -"}
{"text":"The booth seating here is definitely the main attraction for me. I'm not a fan of sports bars but you can tune out the TV noise as long as it's not a big game. The menu isn't very adventurous but there are some solid choices; sweet potato fries and burgers seem popular and I can verify these are both good.  The pricing here reflects the location more than the quality of the food. I think they should add free Wi-Fi too. It can't hurt."}
{"text":"Nice pub right smack dab in the middle of nowhere downtown. The bar staff and waitresses were very friendly but a little absent minded, possibly due to understaffed for the Eurocup finals. The food itself was ok, nothing too special. Average."}
{"text":"Actually 3.5 stars  Stopped in here to watch and witness England lose in the World Cup. I would have to agree that the TVs were a little small and the one we were watching had a black shadow on it (creepy...kind of like something from Ju-on). On the plus side, our server was very attentive despite the crowd. We ordered the pear cider on tap and it was pleasant, and we shared the nacho sticks (big MEH here; I'd pass) and some kettle chip concoction with blue cheese that was weird and surprisingly good. The place was a bit pricey, but not so much that I felt ripped off. In short, it was a decent venue to watch our team lose."}
{"text":"Nothing exciting to say about this pub. We watched the hockey game here. They could do with some bigger tvs.  Service was really, really good but everything else was just underwhelming. Boring menu with boring food. Had the feel of a chain restaurant except it's a British pub.   It does the trick."}
{"text":"A decent duke pub that is clean with good service.   Food wise I like their updated chicken pot pie with the flaky crisp top. I give this chicken pot pie 4 out of 5. It is better than most and comes with mash potatoes and peas.   The portions here are more normal sized and I like that. Instead of piles of fries they provide an adequate portion.   Their 5 for $20 apps is a great way to have some variety. I particularly enjoy the sausage rolls, curry rolls, and sweet potatoe fries.   Their wings are pretty decent especially their hot and the sweet chili version.  They have an ok selection of draught beers including three craft brews.   They had a patio, but you don't really get much sun at this location. You do get to be outside and there is decent foot traffic for some people watching."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is alright. Food wasn't spectacular but wasn't horrible either. Service needs some work.  Came in here because they had a dog bowl out front and we had a dog with us so we're like cool, maybe they'll allow dogs in the patio. Went inside to ask worker 1 to sit in the patio and mentioned we had a dog. She said cool, grab a seat and someone will be right out.  As we sat outside, waiting, worker 2 comes out, sees the dog sitting on the chair, and tells us \"no dogs on the patio, I have a dog too\". Ok... we just told server 1 we had a dog and it was cool but whatever. We put the dog down and tie him to the fence beside us (still in the patio). Worker 2 left so we thought it was good.  Worker 3 comes and apologizes for the confusion. We ask if it was okay to have him tied up at the fence but inside beside us. She did not have any issues with that.  As we're finishing our meal, worker 4 comes out and tells us \"we could lose our license. no dogs in the patio. I have a dog too\". We're annoyed and confused at this point because 4 people gave us different answers and the two that did not want the dog kept bringing up that they have a dog too. Like, what does that matter? So we made the dog jump out of the fence (where he just walked around back in), paid, and left."}
{"text":"I came to this pub as part of a party to celebrate my friend accepting a full-time position. We were a group of 16 or so on what seemed to be a busier than normally busy night. We ordered the a couple of beers, nachos with pulled pork, dreaming of cheese burger and 5 of the basket bite options (fried pickles, popcorn shrimp, potato pancakes, parmesan portabello fries, dry rub ribs). The selection of beer is above average with a good variety of both local and domestic offerings on tap. The basket bites were okay overall---acceptable for bar food accompanying beer. The nachos were decent but pale in comparison to the nachos of Utopia or Sneaky Dee's or even St Louis and somewhat small for asking price. While I understand the servers were overwhelmed on this exceptionally busy night, I still find fault. We asked for no onions in the nachos and yet there they were, embedded in the melted cheese (good thing I'm not allergic). The burger had grilled apple, which was a nice addition to the beef patty and pulled pork. It helped cut down on the oiliness of the burger.   On four separate occasions for ordering more food or beer, the server left prematurely without completing our order. I commend them for having the beers out in an efficient manner despite being overloaded but in the above mentioned they still need improvement. Maybe on a quieter night and all other bar options exhausted might I consider revisiting this bar."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the seating... lots of booth seating, very little (if any) tables.  So you can have some privacy.  The place is fairly well appointed in the soulless corporate sort of way.  We were here for the $12.99 Monday special that caught our eye as we were making our way to St. Louis Bar and Grill.  $12.99 for any burger on the menu and a pint of Keith's.  Not a bad deal.  \"All burgers well-done\" said the menu... I must be mis-remembering because mine was overdone to the point of being slightly burnt and tough.  Everything else was unmemorable... well, the washrooms were pretty nice.  Gah, I've typed enough.  It's a Duke.  You know, a Duke.  I won't be back.  Next time I want a pint in the area, I'll go to Village Idiot.  Or maybe I'll just go to St. Louis next time."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly but also very slow. For $15.99 , the veggie burger and fries were bordering on unacceptable. The serving of fries was so pathetic I asked for more  (which the server brought right away. Full points for her). Other than this pub is close to the office, I wouldn't go back or recommend."}
