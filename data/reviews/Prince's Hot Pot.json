{"text":"place is no longer in business, in case locals want to get some hot pot right now being winter!!!!

Update: Finally a decent hot pot place in downtown Toronto.....go to Celebrity Hot Pot"}
{"text":"The name of this establishment is now Prince's Hot Pot (to coincide with the Prince's Bakery above the restaurant).

$15 all-you-can-eat hot pot.  You pick 1 of 5 soup broths and then go to a buffet bar where there is a variety of meat, veggies and dumplings to add to your broth.  Boil away for 5-10 minutes and enjoy your boiled foodstuffs with 1 of 10 dipping sauces.

Prince's Hot Pot is a good value and the food is fresh.  Staff are friendly and will get you more items if the buffet bar is out of your favourite thing.

I recommend the pepper-based broth and the tripe and lamb combo - very nice."}

Walking into Taste of Shanghai can be a little tricky, particularly if you're wearing heels. This is not the place to go when you're hammered.

But if you're sober and downtown, do it up! They have a decent variety of meats and veggies, not quite as good as you might get in Markham, but the fact that you don't need to hire a team of mules for your journey makes up for it. The place itself is a dark and a little grungy. Better lighting would probably make it look way cleaner. 

Everyone has their own pot, which is great if you tend to undercook everything and need to cook it twice. Double dip! There is also a fantastic assortment of sauces in a self-serve area. The only thing missing was a raw egg, but maybe you could order it? I was too famished to ask.

Lauren and I got the Korean pork bone soup broth, which came with two big hunks of meaty pork bone goodness. It was pretty good, but I was very jealous of Tony's soup, which had big red chilis floating in it and was apparently very tasty. Next time. The quality of the food was pretty standard, and it came out quick. They forgot a couple of things, but they weren't missed as the servings are all pretty huge. Truly, I had all that I could eat.

A delicious meal, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, my boyfriend and I decided to take a trip downtown and have some hot pot (for him it was going to be his first time, and for me ... would be my second/third) however anyways, we reached downtown around 7ish and we went inside the place, which is located in the basement, since we had to walk down narrow flights of stairs, so girls, if you're wearing heels or anything please be careful because it's extremely steep. 

The air was slightly stale, and smelt like the place had not been aired out in awhile, and the place was small, yet cozy. 

When we got there we were greeted by an elderly gentleman, who sat us down and gave suggestion on what to get, we order the beef, chicken, lamb, dumplings and got some veggies and noodles from the refrigerator near the front entrance (the selection was quite few and almost everything was empty), where we also made our sauces. I recommend the beef, it was absolutely delicious, however both my boyfriend and I got incredibly sick afterwards because the food did not settle with our stomachs. 

Out of the 5 stars, I give the place a 2 because of the variety of the noodles and veggies were few, and the fact we both got sick."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this neat hot pot place right in the downtown core.   Had a craving for hot pot, but didn't want to drive far. 

This place is very clean by Chinatown standards, nicely decorated, and very quaint. The pretty good variety of meats, veggies, dumplings, and noodles. The meat quality was actually very good. Each person gets their own hotpot and there are at least 6-7 types of soup bases to choose from. 

I also really appreciated the sauce bar. 

For sure will come back again. Also - nice note - the place was written up in the Globe and Mail in 2010. Very good reviews."}
{"text":"HOORAH! Very decent Chinese hot pot, finally available downtown! Never again will I have to travel to Markham (or will I?)

Taste of Shanghai is a brand new hot pot place on Dundas St W in Chinatown.

If you can survive the treacherous descent down the staircase of death, you will be pleasantly surprised with this place. 

Taste of Shanghai is located in a basement below Queen's Patisserie. 

The place has been refurbished with modern decor, far exceeding the usual ghettoness of typical Chinese restaurants along Spadina or Dundas. Really nice tables, plush red chairs and even a reasonably clean and modern bathroom. Place is small - seats 30 people.

AYCE (all you can eat) Hot Pot will set you back $16.99 on weekdays or $19.99 on Fridays and Saturdays. 

You get your own induction burner at this place rather than sharing with the rest of the table. I quite liked this.

You can select from 5-6 different types of broth (herbal, pork bone soup, spicy, thai tom yum or pork shitake mushroom). There are about 15 kinds of meat, 15 kinds of vegetables, 5-7 noodle/rice selections and some dumpling and tofu choices on the menu. Only a few seafood selections (fish ball, cuttlefish and mussles)

There is a self serve table with sauces and condiments to one side of the room. Everything is nicely labeled in English.

Service was reasonably good but not fantastic. We were given copious amounts of meat but they either forgot some of our vegetable selections, or they didn't have them but failed to tell us. Not a big deal as we were barely able to finish what we ordered. All the veggies were fresh and properly cleaned.

I tried the pork bone soup broth. Amazing! It even came with two pork bones added, just like the real Korean stew version does.

I will be back!"}
