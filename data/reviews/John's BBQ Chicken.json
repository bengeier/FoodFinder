{"text":"I eat out from this place often as I work within the area. I've only had the half chicken lunch special which comes with two sides and have never been disappointed.

Chicken is super tender, rice is delicious and moist and the potatoes are just right. It's simple, clean, delicious Portuguese chicken. Nothing fancy, but everything flavorful. 

Would definitely recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"There food is amazing, I have had alot of Portuguese bbq around toronto but johns bbq is at the top. Food is amazing and very tasty"}
{"text":"Oh baby best chickiken ever, make sure u get the hot sauce and some people like the potatoes so get them too Mmmm Mmmm good"}
{"text":"Being of Portuguese decent, I can assure you that those \"roasted potatoes \" are NOT what any authentic Portuguese restaurant would ever serve! Parisienne potatoes should be nicely crisped on the outside and firm enough to cut with a knife. Instead they are mushy and lacking in flavour,(I believe they BOIL the potatoes then add paprika for colour). The chicken is also not the real deal, dry and over cooked and never order seafood anything! Every time I've tried(3 times) it was spoiled! As for hospitality, the woman always seems angry and not very polite. I have afforded them 1 star simply because their rice is at least edible, but again, not rice one would cook at home:( would never return or recommend it."}
{"text":"My wife and I were marooned in the suburbs without a car and I assumed our dinner would have to be pizza or fast food. But, wait...Yelp to the rescue!

John BBQ chicken is a small takeout-only restaurant in a neighbourhood strip mall. While waiting for your food you can also grab a few Portuguese groceries or tarts (we got 6, delicious).

Of course, the main staple is chicken and that's what we got. They also had a lot more on the menu, but many of the interesting items (i.e. rabbit, some fish items) must be ordered 1-2 hours before arriving.

We got a whole chicken (cut into 4 pieces), a \"small\" potatoes (it's plenty for two people to share), a \"small\" salad, and the 6 tarts. Total bill: $27. Incredible.

The chicken was great, but definitely needed the additional hot sauce provided (get two!). Good flavouring, cooked well, couldn't ask for more.

I wasn't as impressed with the sides. The potato balls didn't have a whole lot of flavour, but were okay with the hot sauce. The salad was very fresh, but nothing special (lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber, and a package of Kraft dressing). The tarts were delicious.

Overall a very solid meal for a great price. Next time I'm in the area I'd like to try what else they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Location is a old strip mall in a residential area and the inside of the restaurant is not much to look at but the food is excellent. Ask for spicy. It's not really spicy but super flavorful."}
{"text":"So this was the first time we tried this chicken.  Have to say it is real good, service was great. Met the owner who was great.  This is a must try place, trust me when I say it's a must try as I've had a lot of different portuguese chicken from a lot of different places and this chicken is right up there."}
{"text":"Codfish cakes! Worth the drive for those alone.  The chicken was good too--I had it grilled and spicy.  Chicken was tender and the sauce was agreeably pungent.  Ordered a side of the codfish cakes and shrimp rissois.  The codfish cakes were all kinds of awesome.  Crispy on the outside and soft and salty on the inside.  Delicately seasoned.  I've lived in Oakville for many years and didn't know this place existed until I came across it on Yelp.  It is tucked away in a residential area just off Ford Dr.  Prices and food quality are above average.  Service is friendly and quick.  They also have a small section of Portuguese groceries and some plump delicious looking olives.  The filet of sole looked tempting.  It's on my list to try next time."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant! I love this take out restaurant , I love there always fresh French fry, or little ball potatoes , everything I have tried at this small take out location has never disappoint me"}
{"text":"Came here because of the good Yelp reviews and was overall satisfied with my meal. Got takeout a whole chicken and sides of rice and potatoes. Sides were average at best sorts of bland and lacking flavour. The chicken was good, definitely the highlight of the meal and worth having again. Would be willing to go revisit but would try different side dishes."}
{"text":"Good value for quantity of food. Location is convenient with plenty of parking but there is usually a lineup out the door. The chicken was overcooked, bland and though we ordered spicy, it was very mild. Sides are also bland both rice and potatoes. I came here based on other reviews to give it a try but will not be back. I can understand why it would appeal to families with picky eaters as there is literally a lack of seasoning. Kitchen was very clean, spotless even, staff friendly but flavour was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"Ordered a tray of potatoes for a Christmas party we had they were good and tried there chicken before was decent I mean it's portugese chicken generally the same wherever you go give or take juiciness ...
My reason for giving 3 Stars ....well I got the little portugese shrimp cakes called rissoles ...got 4 shrimp and 4 cod ..I bit into one and it was bad ...I'm like no way so I bit into another bad ...tried the cod ....bad ....
Seriously not good ...hopefully they take care of that problem and make sure it's always fresh cause its nice to have a good portugese chicken place in the area ."}
{"text":"Can't really beat the price for what you get for take out. Every time I go there it is always a line up of people ordering or picking up their order. 

Their BBQ chicken or roasted chicken are 100% worth getting. Whenever I don't feel like cooking or just craving Portuguese food, this is the place to go in Oakville."}
{"text":"What can I say...? Nothing I love more than good Portuguese chicken...and these guys do it right! Whether you have it from the rotisserie (Espeto) or the grill (Na Brasa), both are excellent! Moist, flavourful, and always fresh. Great (traditional) sides as well.

New favourite spot for take-out :)"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place with great Portuguese chicken. Do not try to go in there and order in English. They won't understand you. I'm just kidding. But they are harcore Portuguese people. They do close shop for a week in the summer because it is family run and they go to Portugal for vacation. This is a place to try if you enjoy Portuguese cusine and BBQ chicken. The chicken they make is kinda spicy with a great flavour that I truly enjoy."}
{"text":"I came here to get take out with my dad after seeing all the high reviews and I have to say that we both really loved how soft and juicy and tender the chicken was!

We ordered a full bbq chicken which was delicious! The flavor wasn't absolutely to my liking but I think it's because was thinking of a sweeter bbq-like taste. But regardless I thought it was yummy and definitely worth getting :)"}
{"text":"Great grilled & rotisserie chicken , sole , rice and potatoes -- Always freshly cooked along with all the specials like ribs and pork and beans.

Chris the son of John is doing a great job over there he is always smiling and being polite."}
{"text":"Great take-out place. Grilled chicken is so tender and got great char to it. The potatoes are delicious as well. Can't beat the food at this price."}
{"text":"I found this Portuguese restaurant on yelp and it was rated very high so I decided to give it a try. It's a tiny take out place in a plaza. I came  at 12pm and I guess it was just opened so there was no one there. The owner is very nice and friendly.  They have lunch specials for $10.49 which you'll get rice, potatoes and half a chicken. Chicken was a little dry and tasteless and the potatoes were also a bit dry. I was disappointed. I was hoping to fine a nice authentic Portuguese restaurant near me."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken. Very good value. They have two types of chicken. Both are very good but Bbq one is a bit dry."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place when I used to work at Shredit around the corner.  It's a great neighbourhood Portuguese Chicken churrasqueira, very yummy chicken, fish, potatoes and rice.  A bit too salty for my liking, but once in a while, it's ok.  We also had this Brazilian guava drink which was really yummy.  Definitely recommended and a repeat."}
{"text":"This Is the place to go to if you want chicken. Also must get the potatoes! It's a small and very traditional place. Don't expect anything fancy, only good chicken and great service."}
