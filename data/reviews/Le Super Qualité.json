{"text":"When it comes to Indian food, what Montreal really lacks is a chaat place. Craving the Indian street food I grew up, I decided to try this place out with a good friend. Both the friendly staff and the unpretentious decor perfectly set the mood for casually catching up on life. Moreover, the chaat was spot on. I asked them to make it spicier to meet my tastes, to which they complied sans hesitation. I tried the dhokla and the dahi batata puri while my friend tried the masala dosa. All three dishes receive my stamp of authenticity. While I will be returning to this place in the future to snack on their dahi batata puri, I would like them to increase their variety with an extended chaat menu. I believe this place really has the potential for becoming a niche restaurant in Montreal for Indian street food."}
{"text":"Place vraiment chouette. Ils ont quelques places seulement donc ça remplis très vite.   Côté bouffe, on a pris les okras frits, Thalia veg, masala dosa et une salade marathi, tous vraiment délicieux et très goûteux avec beaucoup d'épices.   Les cocktails sont aussi très originals avec des inspirations indiens. Mon copain a pris un whiskey khatta qu'il a beaucoup aimé et moi j'ai pris un bloody rasam, c'était intéressant mais à la long, ça tombait un peu sur le cur.   Pour conclure, ça valait le coup, mais j'ai enlevé 1 étoile parce que je trouvais ça quand même chère... thali à 17$ et on se sentait rush de partir et de consommer vite pour quitter la place."}
{"text":"Authentic, recherché and tastes like it came out of my mom's kitchen back in India. Been there a few times and went with pretty high expectations - surpassed my expectations EVERY SINGLE TIME! Must-tries: okra appetizer and non-veg thali. The thali is huge - can easily be split between 2 - if you're ready to share the awesome lamb curry which I won't.  If you are familiar with Indian food and are ready to go off the butter-chicken-beaten path, you must give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Holy. My mouth is on fire. This place is fire. This Indian snack bar is legit. You'll definitely have some questions regarding the menu which is 80% vegetarian (meals with meat are colour coded blue).  Thali was a popular dish (which is unfortunately not available for takeout). They recommended the pork dish, with sides of rice, slaw, and cucumber salad instead.  The dish came in a tiffin box which made the experience 100%. (Though keep in mind that there is a 20$ deposit per tiffin).  The kitchen and staff are super friendly and inviting. This concept is all new and it's fun to have in our city. I wish it were more central so we could go more often.  The owners are from this startup called Cook Caravan and have traveled all of Asia. They are amazing cooks and knowledgeable about the culture and taste of their cuisine.  Super happy with this first experience. Now I'm going to go back to return my tiffin and try that Thali. Maybe next week.  ***I wish there were naan breads included in the meal."}
{"text":"On a tout essayé et tout est bon! Le dahi batata puri et les okras sont au top de la liste. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place brings something - cuisine wise - that I had yet to encounter in Montreal. The food was delicious and different. In terms of the actual restaurant it is more of a snack bar set up. Smaller groups (4 or less) are fine, otherwise it seems like the wait will be long. The decor was nice - sort of like an Indian diner. A lot of thought has gone into the food, drink selection and decor. It feels original. It's Wes Anderson's Darjeeling Limited x Montreal urban food scene.  There's sort of an uncomfortable reality of the place that was mentioned by another reviewer - Indian food by white people for (what seems to be) a largely white clientele. Overall, worth a visit as the food is impeccable, the atmosphere fun, and it inspires thoughts of traveling to India."}
{"text":"As adorable as this place is, filled with fun, hipster Indian style, it really left me wanting to go to Jean Talon for a proper Indian thali.   We arrived so full of hope to this perfectly hipsterized little Indian spot. The service was friendly, the decor impeccable, and the menu very promising.   So we ordered some Indian classics, such as a thali and a street food dish called chaat and eagerly awaited for our feast.   This is where, unfortunately, the love story ends. The food was lacking spice and flavour. It was also very heavy on rice and fillers (chevda- classic Indian chip like snack), but very low on meat and veg dishes. Considering the prices are at least double of what you would pay on Jean-Talon, this was quite disappointing.   If you're looking for a cute spot in the neighbourhood, this might do the trick, but if you're craving good Indian, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Non Indian owners opening up an Indian restaurant. (There was an Indian cook) Of course I am going to try it! I came here on a Friday evening. The place was hard to find driving by in the winter snow but I managed. A very small compact space with south Indian street stop influenced decor including thumbs up, fanta bottles, tiffin boxes up on display, and a small Ganesh statue in front of the cash. Can't forget the bright Neon hand light-that's hard to miss.  The menu was playing it pretty safe with a few choices: I commend that because even a few items cooked and prepared perfectly go a long way. The menu changes on a weekly basis to different regions of India (I believe for the thali). The owners were preparing for a trip to India over holidays - this was impressive-and s A for effort for staying current with authentic Indian food trends!  Entrées: dahi batata puris (comes 6 pieces for 7$-vegetarian) this was a perfectly done dish (5/5) the fact the potatoes were finely chopped, the use of fresh Channa vs canned, garnished with tamarind sauce, the yogurt was not too sweet-all in all a good bite of goodness that melted in my mouth.  Entrées: thali (available with veg or non-veg 17 vs 18$) we went with the the veg option to share -came with 4 items, papadam chips and rice. (3/5) I found extremely bizarre there was no naan bread that is a gold standard for ANY thali. There were 4 curries: eggplant, spinach (a bit under cooked), sambar (vegetable curry that usually goes with dosa), and daal/lentil soup. On a whole I was impressed with the quality of food that in fact did resemble a traditional Indian dish you would find back home.  We also had the dosa -11$, 4/5. This dish was great up to the detail it came served on a banana leaf. The dosa is a crepe with a potato filling, served with a side of coconut chutney (lacked flavour) and sambar (same one from the thali).   Drinks: Billy Mitchell (3/5) was a different take on a Margarita with bitter gourd -tad on the bitter side but enjoyable. The bloody rasam (1/5) came  in a large format didn't taste good at all with a pickled okra (they seem to really like their okras) and a masalafied blood Caesar just did jive right when the meal.  Regardless, I'm still curious to come back again..especially for the dahi puris! good attempt to Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Le Super Qualité is an inspiration of indian's \"Dhaba\", Street food of India. In Honesty, this is the best Indian food I ever had and ironically this place is being run by Caucasians. Let me tell you, they got this place 100% right!   The decor of this place is simply adorable. The menu written in the wall, the banner of the restaurant name, the counter, with top shelves filled with tiffins, the silver dishes and the cash register on wheel...just fantastic. It does look like a proper Indian snack bar, except no mud.;)   The service is delightful and super quick. We were 4 people, and we ordered bunch of dishes to share.   1. Fried Okra with Tamarind sauce. This was our first time to try this item. Nicely crunchy with excellent spiced up batter. Delicious!  2. Dhai Bhatura pani puri! It all about OMG! In regular Indians stores we find pani puri but this dish is excellent as you can find in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.   3. Pav Bhaji! I was ecstatic to find this in their menu, which a new addition to Le Super Qualité. I was so happy just by seeing the dish in front of me, that I actually wanted cry. The minute I tasted the food. I was in heaven. Believe me, no Indian restaurant in Montreal serves Pav Bhaji. It is a super famous dish in Mumbai, India.   4. Masala dosa with coconut chutney and sambar. Simply succulent.  5.\"Bargar\" the way Indians pronounce burger, made with chicken pattie, with Indian spices and chutneys. It was super yummy!   6. Indian sodas, thumbs up(similar to Coca Cola), and Maaza (mango juice), were fantastic. It was really authentic.  The whole experience at Le Super Qualité was wonderful and authentic as Indian's Dhabas. I am going to vouch now that this restaurant is my favorite Indian restaurant in Montreal. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Legit -- solid menu choice, not your average butter chicken joint. Be ready for a bit of spice, but unique flavours too that can be hard to track down in Mtl. Great vibes."}
{"text":"What a beautiful little gem! Just visited for the first time after hearing great things about it, not disappointed.   Tried the Thali, the salad and papdi chaat. So delicious! The staff obviously loves what they're doing, super enthusiastic, warm and welcoming.   Oh and the aesthetics of the place--completed with a neon sign. Dreamy!  Can't wait to go back for the dosa!"}
{"text":"This place is a small Indian food snack bar and is a legit hidden gem. I was doing errands and was attracted by their neon sign and bright turquoise walls. I have to say, I was actually blown away by this place. The decor was adorable. The food absolutely insane. But I have to say what made the place really something special was the vibe in the atmosphere. It's something I have not seen in a restaurant before. The entire staff was so happy to be there, they were all so excited to greet you, serve you, and cook for you. It was bright, intimate, warm and welcoming. You really feel happy to be there. The service was exceptional. Our waiter greeted us with a huge enthusiastic smile and he explained his dishes with pride.  The place quickly filled up with people who obviously had had the same great experience before and wanted more of it. Honestly congratulations to the owners and to the whole staff you should be very proud ! Excellent food excellent service and staff excellent atmosphere what more could you ever want in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"I feel a little conflicted about the cultural appropriation involved in a bunch of white guys opening an Indian Restaurant and charging more than the Indian chefs who work hard to made exceptional and authentic food all over this town. So that has to be said I think right off the bat.   But I will also say, these guys travel in Southern India a lot, and have clearly developed a real love and respect for the food and culture, and obviously treat their customers and staff with love and respect as well. The place glows with care. The food and drinks and even the beer list show attention and love of local. Even the small menu of appetizers feature things I haven't had before, super tasty street food stuff done really well.   The thali was expensive at $18 but big enough for us to share and have leftovers. The room is so comfortable and lovely we wanted to sit there and snack and drink and watch the rain.   I'd suggest working to develop relationships with the local Indian community, maybe inviting guest chefs, hosting cooking classes, fundraisers, culture sharing events - ways to continue to create the bridge of respect and love for Indian culture that is already evident in the food.   Just my two cents, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Petites portions & cher pour ce que c'est vraiment ! Idée intéressante d'ouvrir un concept branché de snack/bar hipster nouveau genre de bouffe indienne à Rosemont/Petite-Patrie, ouvert par des blancs qui ont voyagés en Inde. Déco sympa & ambiance cafétéria, max 10/15 places, bien rempli pour un jeudi soir. On était assis au bar qui donne directement sur la cuisine. J'ai mangé mon thali végé (17$)  mais j'ai déjà connu mieux, sans plus. Ils ont de la bière provenant de micro-brasserie Espace Publique qui accompagne bien les thalis, la mienne était une bière sure, ''Bière de Coin d'Rue'' (6$). Ma copine a pris le thali non-végé (18$), elle aussi, pas impressionnée et surtout pas assez à manger pour ce que c'est vraiment. Ma copine avait ses réserves concernant cette place, elle avait raison selon moi...C'était bon mais il manquait à manger dans les thalis et il manquait ce petit goût indien fait par des vrais indiens....you know what I mean....comme, si j'ouvrai un resto chinois ou pakistanais demain...ce n'est que notre avis après tout...Autre chose à mentionner, le prix, il me semble que c'était un peu cher pour ce que c'était après tout, ça vaut pas ça... Donc 2 thalis + 1 bière + service/pourboire + taxes = 54,21$ À vous de constater. Carte de crédit acceptés.  Expérience mitigée. Je ne pense pas y retourner ainsi que ma copine, car si on veut manger du bon indien, on ira dans un restaurant chez de vrais indiens à Parc-Ex.  3/5 visité en novembre 2016"}
{"text":"Greaaat food!!! The dahi batata puri is amazing... menu changes weekly..great ambience, staff is exceptionally friendly and inviting.. drinks menu is awesome.. hats off to this place!! Must try"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of a trendy indian restaurant opened by Quebecors so close to the best neighborhood in town for authentic Indian food. However, I was pleasantly surprised because this is not just a fusion place, they respected the ingredients and added a lot more varieties in their Thali. Ok, it is $3-5 more expensive than traditional Thahi, but they also have 1) more variety of fresh vegetables 2) less sauce and more meat 3) some kind of spice to flavor the rice- nice touch and very delicious. --In fact, you might first had the illusion that the portion is small because they 'packed' the vege and meat into smaller containers than traditional thali and reduce the sauce  These days, all \"authentic\" indian restaurants more or less have a similar menu in Montreal (not the case in Toronto or Vancouver). There should be more restaurants like \"Le Super Qualité\" to challenge the traditional way of doing business by introducing new items on the Indian food theme in Montreal.  Besides, my 'addiction' for an authentic Lamb Vindaloo won't stop me from visiting other classic Indian restaurants such as Punjab palace or Chand palace at all.   ps: the place is tiny and cute, so it's more for a 2-person sit-down meal or take-out. Cocktail list seems interesting, definitely will try next time."}
{"text":"Superbe decouverte de ce petit resto de quartier aux saveurs indiennes avec un menu simple mais surprenant par son originalité ! Je retournerai sans hesiter :) Propre, bon service et delicieux. Ouvrez votre sprit et profitez des nouveaux concepts."}
{"text":"Great vibes and interesting food - local joint with friendly staff that is happy to familiarize you with their Indian street food menu. I personally know no more about Indian than a good butter chicken, and I had a blast trying new dishes."}
