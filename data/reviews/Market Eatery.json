{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and it was delicious!!! The atmosphere is so cute and quaint, it's like something that belongs in SOHO. Not a lot of seating, but a lot of people take out so it's not a problem.  

A must if you are vegan or vegetarian. The food is so good, you certainly won't be missing out if you choose to get a vegan dish. The avocado toast is amazing and a must get if you love avocado toast like me. Additionally, the waffle towers are phenomenal and just might be the best waffles I've ever had. I believe they are vegan, as the chef said they are made with coconut meat. They have so many flavors of waffles so it might be hard to pick just one!

They also have an extensive smoothie and fresh juice menu if you're in the mood! A great, cute healthy spot that this area desperately needed! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, healthy menu of foods that are very flavorful and delicious. They have a bunch of different options to choose from, smoothies are good and they have different juices that have benefits for your body and for cleansing or detoxifying your body. Overall it's a great place that's run by very nice people."}
{"text":"This is a great vegan restaurant. I love their food, but the portions sizes and prices are a little less reasonable than I'd like but it's enough for the most part. The only thing that makes me give them three stars is the customer service. They have ig pick-up ordering and it's pretty much an unneeded hassle. (You place an order by commenting on the post.) I waited 40 mins to get a confirmation and another time I submitted my order a good hour and half before closing and it never went through (no one got back to me) Also they deleted my order/comment so it's no proof that I ordered unless I screenshot it. (Which I didn't) Also that was a shady thing to do & that's why I'm even writing this review. (They should have gave me an explanation rather than make it seem like nothing happened/I didn't place an order. Because that's good customer service.) I was really rooting for this restaurant especially since it's vegan. They just need to work on the social media ordering process or just use another service like Uber eats, Grubhub, or right through the yelp app because Instagram is not the best place to order food from it seems. I'll give another review soon because I still love their food so hopefully all goes well. My advice is definitely try it out. I read previous reviews and didn't let that that cloud my judgement when trying this place. Now that I've had this situation I will be more cautious when ordering. The staff was kind and helpful but IG ordering is a no for me hopefully that changes in the next few weeks because I will be updating my review to give a complete and honest review. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"I'm so proud of you Cleveland!!!! This place is AMAZING!!!! Very knowledgeable chef!!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't say enough positive things about this place! I came in ten minutes before they were closing, but was still greeted and walked through the ordering process (as it was my first time there and I didn't realize you had to order through the iPad stations) and found the man working extremely helpful and friendly. I ordered the black bean burger with the sweet potato \"bun\" instead of bread and it was amazing. So happy there's a place where I can find vegan options near me instead of trekking all the way to the west side or downtown, and i can't wait to try other things on the menu. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Visited Market Eatery twice and the vegan burgers are really good! Ingredients taste really fresh, so this makes the rest of my experience bittersweet.  Only one complaint about the food, the price tag on a side of fries is ridiculous for the small portion of fries you receive. First time I called in, I was asking about items on their website (the vegan patty melt and the carrot mushroom burger) and the lady I spoke with told me not so politely that I had an old menu. I told her that was on their website. No biggie, but kinda rude. I tried to place an order over the phone and I was told I needed to go onto their Instagram page and place an order in the comments section of a photo and wait for a confirmation. Strange concept. Then when you go in, you have to enter your order (that you already placed on IG) into a kiosk which looks cool, but not very easy to navigate.  My biggest gripe about my experiences here is that they are not very reliable with their means of communication. On two occasions, I had questions regarding items on the menu, I called the store and no answer, then I went on IG commenting asking questions and no response. Once you guys have a better method of communicating and placing orders, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went for the first time today. I got the vegan banana waffles and a lemon ginger juice. Sooooo good!! I'm so grateful a place like this is in my community and owned and operated by people that look like me! No more trips downtown and to the west side for good vegan food when I have this place right in my backyard! 

Update 5/15/18: (3.5 stars) the food is STILL amazing! This addendum is simply to address how this business is run from the perspective of a frequent customer. The staff can come off pretty rude at times. My feeling is that this is not their intention, this is simply how they communicate. For example, the first time I placed an order via Instagram (IG), when I arrived I asked: \"Do I still need to type my order in the iPad.\" The adult man that works there replied: \"you still have to pay for your food.\" Sir! That was not the question. Your answer could have been, 'yes, because when you print your receipt we have confirmation that you have arrived to pick up your IG order and it is paid for.' I have witnessed more than one interaction where the tone and the responses that staff give rub people the wrong way. There was even one time where the same adult male spoke so curtly to a woman that when he walked to the back she just had her mouth hanging open in shock and looked really confused. I was able to rephrase what he said in a gentler way and help her understand what he was trying to say, but she told me she was very confused and was grateful someone was able to actually help her.  Great food/chef, but the staff could improve on customer service skills.

Additionally, since my initial review, the hours have changed 3 times. Something that is frustrating about this is, for example, on Saturdays, they now close at 2PM. At a typical restaurant, when you close at a certain time, that is the last time you allow new patrons into the facility. At this place, it seems 2PM is the time the staff want to make sure they leave. I have come in at 1:40PM and the iPads were already turned off and I was informed they were no longer accepting orders. That can be a little frustrating.

Areas of growth for Market Eatery would be, more staff to service the increase in customers I've noticed over this time and to help speed up the time people are sitting and waiting to be served when dining in. Also, it would be great if the staff could be trained in better communication/customer service skills. While I don't believe they intend to offend anyone, they have been so blunt and harsh with people, that it can be a real turn off. Finally, some concrete hours would be ideal! I could/would go here so much more often if the hours were extended and were consistent instead of changing with the seasons.  

I'll continue to support this black business and hope it will improve as time goes on because the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I don't have an opinion about the food because I wasn't able to order. I places an Order on IG as instructed. The order was placed at 12:20 and requested to pick up at 12:45. I didn't receive a confirmation so when I arrived, I asked if they had received my order, the guy asked my screen name, he confirmed my order but told me that I since I didn't give them 30 minutes, they didn't acknowledge or make my food. No one ever commented that they needed extra time or anything. They then told me that I would be placed at the end of the line and I would need to wait an additional 30 minutes for food. I hear so many good things about the food but my first experience/impression was awful. I can't support insufficient customer services such as this. I will not refer anyone to this place and will forever tell people about my negative experience. My money will spend just the same at a place with common ordering practices and good customer service. My time is valuable and I don't appreciate the disregard for my time by not responding or at least trying to accommodate after I had already arrived. I would have appreciated a response that would given me an option to wait an additional few minutes or cancel the order completely. I will not patronize a place where I am ignored!"}
{"text":"My first and last time walking into market eatery was horrible, I didn't know how it worked so a gentelman that worked there gave me the run down on how to go about ordering which was fine.. So i proceeded to leave while looking at the Instagram and it only said \"Drive through\" i only work on the other side of the plaza where Market eatery is located and when i asked the owner about additional \"Pick up options\" because they were not on the Instagram she was very rude saying \"Omg you're killing me, listen we're a one of a kind instagram restaurant. All you have to do is read the directions\" i tried to explain to her that i couldn't find an pick up options other than drive through and before i could finish my sentence she told me she was not going to repeat herself and closed the window and walked away. Hands down worst customer I've ever experienced in my life idc how good the food may be this woman is extremely rude!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I love the convenience in ordering my meals because it is interactive. The food is fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"I don't know who else is back in the kitchen with the owner (if anyone), but everything I get here is amazing to eat. It's rare and special to find food that's healthy that you crave more than a burger and fries but I discover something new and delicious each time. First it was the waffles, then the \"sausages,\" and most recently a smoothie that was truly unlike any strawberry smoothie I've tasted. If you can figure your way through the ordering process, it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"THE WORSE EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE 
The customer service was SOOO BAD that I did not get a chance to try the food.  I had to get my money back.  I will not support this black business.
1st -when you enter there is no one at the front, one would have to go to the back to get some help. 
2nd- they don't have a menu you have to look at these tiny picture on Ipad to order food.  And the I pad don't have description on what in the food.  I was told to go to instagram to see what is in the food. Well, some people don't have instagram.
3rd-TOO EXPENSIVE.  NOT SURE IF IT WORTH IT. FOR VEGAN  JUNK FOOD 
But what really upsetting about  the restaurant was THE OWNER/HEAD CHEF TALK TO ME WITH SUCH GREAT DISRESPECT.  I asked her for a cup to get some water.  She gave me  so much attitude told me it was over there , when it  was not , and walk away.  The other staff member come out and I asked him for my money back ($31) because am supporting and spending good money on black business and she get nasty at me because I just ask for a cup.  The owner heard asking for my money back and said to me \"You don't know how to eat healthy anyway you are Fat why don't you get a burger at McDonalds\"   
I can understand why the restaurant is always empty because of The owner's attitude.  I have already told my family, friend, co worker, vegetarian friends not to eat there.  So sad I was looking forward to the place."}
