{"text":"My husband and I tried this place today and we highly recommend it! Great food and service! We were so excited to learn that another Korean/Asian fusion restaurant opened in Pittsburgh and this place did not disappoint. Love the fact that their food's organic, all natural, and locally sourced. Everything was seasoned well and the sweet potato tempura batter was light and crispy. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Beautiful, yet simple decor. Delicious food. Kind, helpful, and knowledgeable staff! Loved the beef with glass noodles and cucumber salad! My boyfriend got the fried chicken and loved it.  Also, we were given complementary tea while we waited for dinner service to begin. Very nice of them to think of the customer. Highly recommend. Good people, great food."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to get a quick meal before a show downtown! The food is good, the space is beautifully decorated with live plants and pictures of flowers, and best of all, the people working there are extremely friendly. I've tried their three different meats now, and my favorite is the bulgogi beef. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Was craving Korean food while driving through PA and found this little gem. Taste like my mom's cooking,  but cleaner and more fresh. 2 thumbs up for Bae Bae! Please open Bae Bae's #2 in Pal Park NJ!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Great portion size for cost. Really fresh and good quality, nutritious food. I have food allergies and they were very helpful with my food selection. Gf df friendly! Vegan options too! The tofu is the best I've had in Pgh! The staff were so warm and helpful :)"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food and the employees behind the counter were so nice! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the interior and location, and good space with a fun concept of ordering by choosing a grain, meat, and sides at a counter. The bulgogi was slightly too sweet, and the honey/wasabi sauce for the Korean Fried Chicken was far too sweet. Sides of cucumbers and Kim chi were quite nice, though together a meal runs a bit high at 13$. We will be back to try it out again."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place from the aesthetics to the food. I popped in for the first time yesterday. For a place that just opened last week, I was impressed by the efficiency. The menu is straightforward Korean food with no fancy tricks, just delicious cooking!  I ordered bulgogi over fried rice with a side of kimchi - it was delicious. As a bonus, they tossed in a sample of potato tempura, and that too was tasty. While I ordered my food to-go, I did notice how cozy the eatery was for dining in. I look forward to frequenting this spot and working my way through the menu. Good food, fast and friendly service. Bae Bae's kitchen is such a gem."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian restaurants I've ever eaten at. They need to expand - the food is amazing. The chicken and the tofu are both so good. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a really wonderful lunch here.  Staff was friendly and the food was excellent.  I wish I had taken a photo because it looked great too."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite before a workshop at Arcade. Had the bulgogi with rice and a side of kimchi. It came with sweet potato tempura and a few greens too. The food was DELICIOUS! So good! And the staff was incredibly friendly, helpful, and kind. The space seats 12 at tables and 9 or 10 at the bar-like seating. I had no problem getting a spot when I stopped in. Highly recommend!!!"}

{"text":"Their fried sweet potatoes are awesome. Korean beef is also very good and has a nice flavor. Their kimchi and other side dishes are wonderful. The staff are friendly and the quality of the food is well worth the price. It's hard to find good restaurants who value organic and high quality food as much as they do, not to mention an Asian restaurant too."}
{"text":"Love and organic options. Staff was extremely nice not sure what I was expecting but definitely happy with my results"}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere playing American pop music. Spent $40. Summary is a fast food version of Korean food where they cut costs by using cheap ingredients and attempt to supplement for real ingredients while cheating the consumer with overpriced food. This seems to be the trend in Pittsburgh. We had the noodles with bulgogi and seaweed salad, the rice with (Korean Fried Chicken) KFC, sweet potato tempura, miso soup and a chamomile tea. Chamomile tea was $3.  Miso was comparable to the miso you can purchase at Walmart but bae bae's is $3. I personally think the out of the whole meal the sweet potato tempura was the best because of the creamy spicy wasabi sauce. Their KFC was chicken tenders with
 Japanese breadcrumbs on it and tastes like the oil it was fried in with no seasoning. There was some honey wasabi sauce they added on the side but it did little to make up for the lack of effort placed in making the food. The seaweed salad was imitation made of cucumber (!) and was basically an attempt to take a short cut to make a base for their daily side the Crab Salad. The beef bulgogi had enough fat and tendon on it you might choke trying to swallow it (why did I pay for fat and tendon?) they also have half cups of iced tea. If you order one they fill it with ice and you may be fooled into believing you got what you payed for. Don't settle for the Americanized dumbdown version get the real thing at the Korean Garden in Shadyside or the Korean restaurant in Oakland."}
{"text":"Food was great. I had the pork belly and noodles with kimchi. Kimchi was homemade and spicy, it was excellent. They also gave us some free sides which was very nice."}
{"text":"Came with co-workers because it was the only place that could take a large group at the time. We were initially not sure if we'd like it based on the menu but we still went. What a pleasant surprise. The food was amazing: much better than expected. I thoroughly enjoyed the Korean fried chicken with the wasabi sauce (sweet and spicy). Everybody enjoyed the sweet potato tempura: they even brought extra for us to eat. For the price, you get your monies worth, which is a whole lot of food. Cool spot for casual dining or take out."}
{"text":"Really good Korean food. I recommend it so it has to be good. It's a unique place that is family owned."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The KFC (Korean fried chicken) was so juicy and delicious. Cheese wontons! Kimchi! Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!! Go here right now!"}
{"text":"Delicious and generous portions! Friendly faces behind the counter and a very cozy place to dine. I tried the bulgogi and the glass noodles and it did not disappoint. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Great food. I wouldn't say it's traditional korean food but everything was tasty. Nice and friendly staffs and great atmosphere. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. 
This place is great- really great. Great vibe, friendly staff, and the owners are kind really personable! Their front window is full of live plants, and their high ceilings and open concept was refreshing. I spoke with Ashley, the co-owner, and she was super sweet. 
I didn't even get started with the food yet! To keep it short, the food is fresh to order, healthy, and tastes great! The spices and subtle sweets complimented each other, and the salad was a good balance to the bulgogi. Also- take the Kimchi pickles if they have them. 
On. Point. 
To top it off- they made special Fruity Pebbles Rice Krispies.. with gummy bears! Delicious, even though I had to break up eating it into two sessions to avoid a sugar rush. 
Bottom line- if you are in the area, and are on the hunt for  a healthy and tasty meal with Korean inspiration- Go here, it was the best meal that I had in Pittsburgh! Good, fresh, \"clean\" food that doesn't taste \"healthy\". 
If, for some reason, I'm ever in Pittsburgh again- I will make it back for another go!"}
{"text":"Bae Bae's Kitchen is sooooooooo good! Soo fresh! Super awesome for vegan vegetarian and those who love the meat! Super cute and everyone super nice"}
{"text":"Amazing vibe and food is legit! Ordered glass noodles, KFC,and cucumber kimchi. Came with small order of sweet potato tempura. Very cool that they don't accept tips- only donations to humane society!"}
{"text":"Loved the concept, a Korean style fast food place. You can get either rice or noodles, a side salad, a choice of protein, and one banchan.

 The portion was perfect for me, tons of veggies with delicious chicken cutlets. The food was delicious,and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the downtown lunch scene.  We need more spots like Bae Bae's that offer good food at a good price and a great location and atmosphere. 

Try the KFC and Bulgogi"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to meet for lunch and we wanted to go somewhere we have never been.  After a quick search on Yelp, we choose Bae Bae's Kitchen.  The place itself is very small/quaint.  I can see how it would be difficult to get a place to sit during peak times.  Since we visited after the lunch rush, there were several seats open.  We chose to sit at the table that faces the sidewalk and got to wave at several people peeking in the window.

All of the staff that we encountered were very friendly and helpful.  I ended up ordering a bubble milk tea, Korean Fried Chicken (so much for healthy!)with glass noddles & spicy crab salad.  We also ordered the crab wontons.

I really enjoyed the milk tea, noodles and spicy crab salad.  The crab wontons were excellent.  I really enjoyed the sauce that came with the wontons.  The chicken was cooked very well and was crispy and fresh, I just didn't really care for the sauce that came with it.  

The meal was $12 by itself and I felt that a reasonable portion was provided.  My total bill was $21 when the milk tea and wontons were added.  I can't spend that on a lunch everyday, but it was a nice treat.  I will be back and will try some different proteins."}
{"text":"Bae Bae's is a great addition to the downtown food scene. I had the pork cutlets with the noodles - both of which were fantastic."}
{"text":"Very vegan friendly food! The service is always super good. The food is perfect, everything is organic and made daily. I can feel the food is cooked with love!!"}
{"text":"Best place downtown period! Great friendly staff and everything is fresh made. There are cheaper places to eat but the quality they offer is well worth a few extra dollars! Unique and tasty when you're tired of the same old food!"}
{"text":"First of all, how cute is the name? Second of all, how awesome is it that there is finally a Korean restaurant downtown? 

I visited with a few coworkers a few weeks after they opened. Not sure if staff were still learning, but the service was extremely slow during our visit. The space is really small with only about four tables and at one point, the line circled the entire place where the end of the line was right at the beginning! Anyhow, I was willing to overlook this if the food was good. I got the beef with noodles and I thought it was pretty decent. The flavor was mild, but still quite tasty. While it wasn't the best I've had, it also definitely was not the worst. I would definitely stop back!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch. Quantity is a lot and food is fresh. Taste is good although I wonder if they use extra salt and or msg for seasoning. I tried the crispy tofu and kfc chicken. Both were crisp and flavorful. The tofu was good with the dark sauce. The only thing I wish they had was ability to do combo. I wanted the chicken plate with the tofu side just for a taste of the tofu but ended up ordering two plates (one of each)"}
{"text":"We tried this place for an early lunch last week. The food was all super fresh and flavorful. I had the bulgogi chicken with noodles and kimchi. The kimchi was pretty standard. The noodles had good flavor, but were a little greasy. The chicken was really good, but I hear that the fried chicken is the best option here. I will have to go back and try that sometime soon. 

The interior of Bae Bae's is super small, so if you want to sit to eat, you have to be lucky or get there early. Everything already comes in to-go containers, so if you are looking to take something with you, this is a great option too."}
{"text":"This was a great find near my hotel, where options were limited for take out food. The staff was super friendly and helpful in explaining how the menu worked. I had their beef bulgogi with their glass noodles and veggie tempura. The food was super tasty and offered something different than your typical sandwiches and salads. If you're in the mood for something different, I suggest Bae Bae's"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood! Tofu and glass noodles hit the spot. The only downside was all the extra greens on the side. They were a little overwhelming. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Long story short - Amazing authentic food and great service, go eat there.
As a Korean working in Pittsburgh for a project, I didn't expect to be able to get my Korean food fix downtown but I go to this place at least once every week for lunch. As regulars, my coworkers and I have tried most of their options and are never unsatisfied. They've changed some menu items after the new year and I'm even more excited! For people trying it out for the first time, I'd definitely recommend the noodles and either the beef or chicken option. Their fried chicken is always perfectly crispy and the honey-wasabi sauce that comes with it is amazing. They've also come out with a new braised short rib option that just seems to melt in your mouth. All their side dishes are great too - I love their napa and cucumber kimchi because it tastes like it was really made by loving Korean cooks ~
The people there care about all of their customers, the space is quaint but wonderfully decorated, their beverage options are also awesome (try their bubble tea!) and their portions are generous. They always give you complimentary tempura with the plates, which are also always perfectly fried. The service might be a tad bit slow but it's worth it to support a local business and eat some authentic Korean food.
Thanks, bae bae -"}
{"text":"Korean clean food in the city of Pittsburgh. Ordering:
Choose your base, I picked jap chae (glass noodle), choose your protein, I picked bulgogi. Choose your side, I picked kimchi. 

Food: Balance and delicious, not excessive use of oil. Not salty, not bland, just balance. Feels like you are eating clean food, not the typical Korean restaurants food. 

Price: wowee a tad pricier, ordered 2 orders of the plate, 4 pieces of dumpling, and 2 bottles of tea came out to be $40. Great thing about it actually, no tips! They accept donation. 

Overall, will definitely go back for healthier choice but not my go to, I like unhealthy stuff."}
{"text":"What a great little spot. I love Bae Bae's! All of their food has been fresh and delicious. I can't really say anything bad about them. They always try to have something new on their menu, which I really like. I love their tofu, it's crispy and flavorful, as well as their bulgogi beef. Everything there has great flavor to it. Even the fried rice. I really like that they try to locally source their food and also keep it ethical. I love coming here for lunch, it's close to where I work. Definitely try it, if you haven't. They even have bubble tea, which is a treat! 

You can build your own box, as well, and they give you really great sized portions. It's a little pricey for lunch, depending on what you get, but worth it! Everyone who works there is very nice and friendly. And what makes them even better is that they don't accept tips, however, you can make a donation and it all goes to the humane society"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review after returning 2 days later. I had leftovers yesterday, so I am technically eating Bae Bae 3 days in a row.

On Monday I had the build your own plate. I chose tofu meatballs in a mushroom curry gravy and glass noodles. It came with squash tempura, salad, and cucumber kimchi. The meatballs were the tastiest vegan concoction I have ever had. The kimchi was so good, a tad sweet rather than sour, which I liked. And the tempura was perfectly crispy and delicious. I had enough to eat for dinner the next day. 

Today I ordered the tofu kimbap with miso soup. It also came with the salad and tempura. The tofu kimbap has a nice plum sauce on it. I do wish it was cut in small pieces. It was difficult to eat delicately. But who am I kidding? I don't care. 

The service was great, too! You order at the counter, where a super nice guy explains the menu and specials and there are displays of the food so you can see what you are ordering. There is no tipping, but there is a jar collecting for the humane society in lieu of tips. 

The restaurant itself is small and is probably more conducive to take out, but it is quite cute and quaint if you decide to eat in. 

I only come to the 'burgh on business, but I will be returning to try all the items on each visit. Bookmarked as a Pittsburgh fav in my yelp app."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a place to execute Tofu the way it should be executed.  Finding this place was a saving grace from the usual lunch spots while working downtown.  The employees were very friendly in explaining what each dish was so you'd make the best decision.  I can't speak highly enough about the Tofu, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, every place I've had Tofu at anywhere in Pittsburgh has been mush; this place did it right! The flavors are all on point, seaweed salad is well balanced and I would put the plum sauce for the Tofu on EVERYTHING if I could. The only complaint I have is how pricey the menu is and everything does seem to be fried.  I wish there were more non-fried options, but that will not deter me from coming here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"quite delicious! and its environment is lovely and sweet! but you have to wait 5-10 mins."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, and absolutely adorable inside. This place is set up to create your own box meal where you chose from a base (rice, glass noodles, greens), protein (bulgogi, Korean fried chicken, pork and tofu), and some sides. I got the glass noodles, chicken, pickled cucumbers (so good!), they also added some mixed greens and sweet potato tempura. So much food! The staff was so kind. I thought it was awesome that they don't accept tips but rather donations to the humane society. I love the hip vibe with the lighting and succulents. Can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Pittsburgh for a conference over the weekend. We love different types of cuisine and we felt very lucky to find this little Korean restaurant! The food was clean, the flavors were great and the people were super nice! Other little thing: you don't tip but you can leave a donation for an animal shelter! We recommend this place a lot !!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! It's small so seating might be tough for larger parties, but the atmosphere is really cute. They clearly put a lot of work into decorating, there's adorable little succulent plants and lights everywhere. I built a plate with Korean fried chicken (so good, the skin was perfectly crispy. I tried the bulgogi and this was better in my opinion), which came with a wasabi dipping sauce, and glass noodles with salad. It comes with one side but the server gave me two, cucumber kimchi and potato salad! The server today was amazing, he was so friendly and upbeat and even gave us free sweet potato tempura because it wasn't available when we ordered. He also gave me extra boba in my Vietnamese coffee. Very happy with everything!"}
{"text":"Super cute place with a trendy aesthetic. The wait to order was a little awkward, but the staff was very friendly.  I tried their rice, tofu, and sprouts and was pretty satisfied overall! I've never had tofu prepared that way and although it tasted good it was a little cumbersome to eat. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a tasty vegetarian or vegan meal."}
{"text":"This is a great place for fast casual Korean. Solid offerings for both food and drink. Everything was really yummy and the service was fantastic - I came close to closing, but they were very kind and patient as I was choosing. Love the daikon kimchi and I even got a complimentary sweet potato tempura. Also love that they give back: leftover food goes to shelters and tips to Humane society.

Will definitely be back whenever I'm in Pittsburgh, what a cute little gem!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! 

The Korean fired chicken will leave you wanting more. Everything is so fresh and tasty. It's pretty much first come first serve so go early because they will run out! 

Their Kimchi is a family recipe and it is so yummy! This place is small and family owned. Everyone is so friendly and the vibe there is chill.

You cannot go wrong with any of their offerings. Go and go early, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Wonderful choice for lunch or if you wanted a take out dinner.
Seems as though they change the menu daily but I would definitely come back. I had the beef short ribs and noodles and traditional kimchi. Everything was excellent, fresh, and very tasty. Also tried my daughters fried chicken and my wife's tofu, both outstanding. Oh, and their fried sweet potatoes are a must."}
{"text":"I was craving Korean food, and after all the positive reviews I had read about this place, I decided to give it a go after work. I got the beef, which was marinated in what I thought was too sweet a stew, with the glass noodles, seaweed salad, and they threw in a complementary salad and tempura sweet potato (yum!). It is a popular spot and sometimes they will sell out of some of their dishes (the pork was sold out, and people were waiting for the chicken to be finished in the kitchen).

However, in terms of satiating my Korean craving, it didn't quite hit the spot. The flavors were okay, but not great. I think next time I have such a craving, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just like mom's cooking! Their selection is mostly organic proteins with traditional Korean flavors. Fast casual setting in a warm and friendly environment."}
{"text":"Bae Bae's is a welcome addition to the downtown lunch scene! I love both the beef and fried chicken options. I think the portion size is totally fine for the price point, and I love that they offer milk tea. The decor inside is super cute, too!

I go there a good bit, and my one complaint is that they often run out of things midway through the lunch hour. I don't mind, I typically will just get something else, but it would be nice to have more options. As others have said the line can get long, but I do think they work through it fairly quickly!"}
{"text":"Terrific food and atmosphere! Most things on the menu are between $10-$20, and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"I am completely obsessed with this place.  I go at least once every two weeks!  No judging!  
1.  The individuals that work here are super nice!
2. Which should really be #1 the food is amazing!
I tired everything but the tofu and my favorite are their pork meatballs when they have them.The meatballs are always moist and not dry.  I don't know what sauce is on them but it is tasty!   The KFC ( Korean Fried Chicken) is so moist and juicy.  The wasabi honey sauce has a nice kick and opens my sinuses.  The pork belly had good flavor I just couldn't get past all the fat.  The veggies that could me with the pork belly were awesome!  

I love love love the noodles.  Im full all day and night long!  

The line does get long at lunch rush and you may have to wait for something to be made since everything is made fresh however it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"If you are facing down a difficult/long day at work I highly recommend you eat here. 

Their meals contain all the food groups---some lightly dressed greens, a carb, a protein, a side, and a little treat (the sweet potato tempura). Basically you get a full stomach but don't feel yuck afterwards...you feel energized and happy! I'm not really a woo-woo type but I think because the food is sourced well and made with care that contributes to the positive vibes.

They also give you enough food for another small meal later in the day so I feel the price is worth it. The owners and the people who work here are lovely and incredibly hospitable."}
{"text":"I got the make your own bowl -noodles with tofu. The noodles (jap chae) were fine but the tofu was so greasy and tasteless. They also only give you one little side (Banchan) which is so small. And the price is so expensive $13! Kind of a rip off, especially in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a lovely afternoon for a late lunch with a friend. I'd been meaning to try this place out and finally got the chance! Loved the decor (they have plants hanging everywhere!!) and found it super casual and fresh. Now the food...delish!

I'm so happy to have finally found a place Downtown with awesome Korean food, on par with the Korean food I've had in NYC. The wait was a little bit, but they were definitely preparing the food fresh which was so worth it.

I started with the noodles and had the Korean fried chicken with the soybean sprouts as a side. The noodles were nice and chewy with yummy veggies, not too oily or salty. The chicken was AMAZEBALLS, surprisingly super moist with a great crispy crust. The sides were also great and the wasabi honey dipping sauce for the chicken was great as well. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing organic Korean food. Expertly cooked by friendly staff. You can mix and match your grain/veggies with protein, just like a Chipotle type restaurant. I HIGHLY recommend you try it if you're in the area and looking for something new. Just fantastic food! The kimchi sides are spot on as well."}
{"text":"Having just moved back from Pittsburgh from LA, I was dreading the heaviness of the food in this city.  I was pumped to hear about Bae Bae's but feared it wouldn't meet my expectations. 

I was wrong. The food was exactly what I was hoping for.  I would best describe it as LA modern Korean--fresh clean food, not perfectly authentic, but very clear where the roots came from. 

Most of all, their banchan (side dishes) were on point. The best kimchi I've ever had in Pittsburgh (there isn't that much). Most importantly, they use the correct Persian cucumber for their cucumber kimchi which keep the crispness better. 

I'll also say, the service was very thoughtful and intentional, something that I find is often lacking in Pittsburgh restaurants."}
{"text":"I was staying at the drury inn across the street and was looking for something that was no bar food or heavy. Thought I'd give it a try. Very tasty, very fresh and very clean. I travel a lot and it is always nice to find something a little different, within budget, and walking distance from where one stays. Good choice unless u like bland food."}
{"text":"The perfect winter work lunch: it's comfort food that doesn't make you feel like you need a nap or a long run immediately afterward. I have tried both bulgogi and the bbq pork belly (each excellent). For sides: the Kimchi is my clear favorite. The service here is fantastic. Lines can get long (because word is spreading about how good it is) but the staff are always friendly and quick. And sometimes they offer little extras with your meal. Today the cashier asked if I liked sweet drinks and gave me a free sweet tea to enjoy. It's on the higher end for me pricewise for a fast casual spot but I think for the quality of ingredients, taste, and all of the different things you're getting (protein, carb, salad, side, tempura veggie) it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"This is my first Korean food outing and I went to NO OTHER than Bae Bae's little 'ole kitchen...

This is a cute, small, modern cafe with seating in the front and a MAGICAL dining room in the back with lots of lights.

I tried the choose your own combo with salad and glass noodles that had an Asian sesame sauce, some fried zucchini and fried Korean chicken with wasabi honey sauce that was tender and moist.

They also have a hot bar where you pick your own food.

It was good if you like Korean styled food or vegan food or fried treats and snacks."}
{"text":"Yes. Just yes. I love having yet another fast casual lunch option downtown, and I love it even more for being of an Asian variety.  I popped in today right as they opened for lunch, and the guy behind the counter was very patient and friendly with me as he gave me a rundown of the ordering process and food options.  I opted for the \"special\" fried rice, the KFC, a side of kimchee, and they threw in some complimentary sweet potato tempura which was so so good.  So good. Everything. So good.  And it's not just tasty food, but a sweet atmosphere and great music. (90s R&B at the time of my visit.)  Putting this in regular rotation on my lunch dining options..."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Casual atmosphere with many potted plants that have a calming effect. I had the garlic noodles which had oodles of garlic in them. My food took a while to arrive so one the employees gave me a free appetizer. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of positive buzz from the comedians who perform next door at Arcade Comedy Theater that Bae Bae's food was delicious and service was great. I finally got the chance to stop in for lunch last week and man, they were right. KFC, jap chae, cucumber kimchi were all super fresh, flavorful, and tasty. Great, quick service even with a bit of a line. The space couldn't be sweeter; sitting in the window withe my friend, watching people walk by and admiring all their plants was a lovely way to spend the lunch hour. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious! This was a great way to introduce our kids to Korean cuisine and it was a healthy, trendy, city atmosphere which is great. It was clean and healthy. They even brought us out free sweet potato tempura as we were eating, just to be nice."}
{"text":"I Love this place, the vibe, the decor, the awesome friendliness of the owners .....and of course the Delicious food offerings!....If you're new to Korean food stop by for some JapChae (noodles), Spicy Pork Belly, KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), Galbi-Jjim (Braised Grass-fed short ribs), and so much more.
Don't forget your Banchan (small dishes of tasty morsels)!

........You're welcome in advance"}
{"text":"Friendly service and cute place but this is not real korean food.  The salad was fresh which I liked but the rest of the food definitely didn't meet our expectations.  I got the \"pork belly\" which was like 4 pieces of bacon and way too much onion.  My husband got the korean fried chicken which turned out to be a chicken katsu.  Disappointing and overpriced."}
{"text":"So we stop by last weekend during the Pride Festival. The storefront was closed, but they had a stand. The options were more limited than the menu, but we still tried. An order of glass noodles, wings, and Thai ice tea with boba. Noodles were great, wonderful flavor. Wings were basic and it was the spicy mayo that added the flavor. Not the Korean wings I'm accustomed to. Thai ice tea with boba was on point. All in all, it was pricey and above average. So why the five stars? 

Well, go to the storefront! I found myself in the area the following Tuesday and the aroma won me over. I got the pork with rice special. At $10, it was much more reasonable than the festival pricing. The pork was so hearty and included a boiled egg, very much traditional Asian. It was quite sizable and I found myself with leftovers. Overall, the flavor was wonderful and vibe was fast paced but polite. Definitely come by!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying food in here and I am very happy. I ordered glass noodle with KFC along with veggie tempura. The portion is huge for $13~$14. The chicken is really crunchy. I wish I remembered to add hot sauce in the chicken, then it will be perfect. I definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch for a reasonable price.  The food is really good and you get plenty of it."}
{"text":"I don't give five star reviews easily or frequently.  However, Bae Bae deserves it.  We stumbled upon this lovely gem when a few of us were looking for lunch after going to the Andy Warhol museum.  We had a wedding later that day and wanted something yummy but not too heavy.  First off, the owner is awesome!  So patiently answered all of our questions and didn't mind that we broke our order up into smaller orders so each person could pay for their own.

While waiting for our food (which came out pretty quickly), we were brought complimentary tempura.  Soooo good!  Lightly battered and fried.  I had the buns filled with chicken - although fried, the chicken was tender and still light.  The kimchi was perfectly spicy - not too over the top.  I also really enjoyed the potato salad side.  One friend had the pork belly buns and greatly enjoyed them.  The other had the boodles with pork belly and also enjoyed those.

If I find myself back in the Pittsburgh area, I will definitely pop back in for some more yummies."}
{"text":"Bae Bae's was good, but not spectacular. I built my own bowl with japchae noodles, bulgogi, greens, and kimchi. I liked the noodles and greens, but I was not a huge fan of the bulgogi. It was very greasy and tasted bland. The kimchi was ok, not the best I've had. I don't really like how they put the food in to go boxes either, it just gives me this weird vibe- like they want you to hurry up and leave or something. I felt kind of rushed while I was eating. I understand that Bae Bae's is a fast casual restaurant, but I wish they had actual plates for guests who want to stay and dine. 

The price for the food is somewhat expensive, as it's $13 for mediocre bulgogi. I wasn't highly impressed with Bae Bae's, as it's supposed to be \"healthy\" but is their definition of \"healthy\" greasy meat and tempura? I'm not so sure if I want to come back again, but I did enjoy the plants in the restaurant and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Given that I work downtown, it is really exciting to see new ethnic restaurants popping up. Like other reviewers have noted, it is a pretty tiny establishment and it gets very busy during lunch. While this is a great thing for the business, it can create customers to become antsy if service is slow. 

My co-workers and I stopped in on a Monday at 11:30 when the doors opened. This is a food court style restaurant and you make your selections as you go. The menu isn't overwhelming which makes ordering less time consuming. I ordered the traditional Korean bulgogi and glass noodles. The beef was very tender and perfectly seasoned. If you are building your own plate, I would highly recommend choosing the bulgogi as your protein. The box comes with a side of bok choy and another side that you can choose. The bok choy was flavorless and they were out of cucumber salad. This was a little disappointing since it was a Monday morning and they should have been stocked up for the week. 

Also, I would like to comment on the person that was preparing the boxes also had to cover the register at one point. There was someone different on the register, but she had to prepare a large order of milk teas and couldn't do both. This caused a back up because no one was preparing the boxes while he was covering the register. I think they have some kinks to work out with the service line, but overall I was pleased with my bulgogi."}
{"text":"I just had to try this new place in town! It's hard to find good Korean food and I was thrilled to find this place downtown. We came here during early dinner on a weekday and it was pretty empty. I wasn't too thrilled that the food was kind of buffet style where it was already made and you saw them put it on the box, this just doesn't seem as fresh as if they were to make it in the back as you don't know how long that food has been sitting there. 

We got the pork belly with the glass noodles and fried squash to go. By the time we got home, the food was pretty cold but it didn't bother me. The food was okay. The pork belly wasn't seasoned that well as I couldn't taste anything and the noodles weren't even close to the best ones I had. My favorite part was the fried squash which surprisingly was good. Overall, I didn't really care for the food as I thought that it was overpriced for the quantity."}
{"text":"So good! Lots of food for the price, not to mention it's all natural, local products. The bulgogi was so good, so tender and juicy! Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot downtown with friendly service and delicious food!

You can build your own dish by choosing a starch, protein and a side. I went with the glass noodles, Korean fried chicken and a seaweed salad. Everything is pre-cooked and ready to serve as you create your dish. It was quite filling for $12!

I am really looking forward to coming back and trying the Bulgogi!"}
{"text":"Drove up from Wash PA with some foodie friends based on the yelp reviews. I was not disappointed. Honestly not the best Korean food I've ever had, but really fresh and the atmosphere and staff were so pleasant. I was NOT excited by the price of my bubble tea - $5.35! But I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food in a fast-casual setting. 

Was very excited to check this place out - it looked very nice on the internet and I'm always looking for something on the less expensive side to eat while downtown.

We showed up at noon on a Saturday, right as they were opening. They were running late, so they gave us a portion of tempura on the house to eat while we waited - love that service!

I had glass noodles and tofu with plum sauce. I enjoyed both but the highlight for me was that they have vegetarian cucumber kimchi! Loved it!

Overall had a great experience and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I just flew into Pittsburgh for a conference and while I was in route to CVS to pick up some incidentals, I stumbled upon this place. The name sort of attracted me to walk in and not knowing anything about Korean food, I was surprised to find it was a Korean spot. But the food was great! I had their BBQ beef rice bowl and they threw in some chicken tempura for me to try. Since I had to wait all of 5 minutes for the beef to finish, they also gave me a tea while I waited. Excellent customer service! Both the man at the counter and woman at the register was so gracious and courteous. If I'm ever in town, I'll be sure to pay a visit. It was a welcoming environment for someone who was just passing through."}
{"text":"A cute little cafe vibe, the plants in the window and overall atmosphere make for a lovely place for you to eat your meal. There is limited seating, but the back of the store has seating with long tables that would be ideal for bigger parties. The menu is rather limited, but the components of each meal is done well and packs a symphony of tastes and flavors as you can mix and match a protein, a pairing (rice, glass noodles, or salad) and a side dish.

I chose the bulgogi with rice and a side dish of kimchi cucumbers while my friend chose the Korean Fried Chicken with rice and tempura vegetables. I also got a Thai iced tea and added boba to it (which they gave me plenty!). The fried chicken was moist and perfectly fried and the wasabi-honey sauce that came with it was good. The bulgogi was well marinated; however, my only complaint was that they added too many onions and not enough beef. 

The next time I go downtown, I will definitely be coming back here to try the other choices!"}
{"text":"I had the noodles and bulgogi bowl with seaweed salad on the side for about $14. A bit pricey but the food tasted awesome, especially by Pittsburgh Asian food standard. I just wish the serving size could be a little bigger especially for the seaweed salad. However they were pretty generous with the portion of bolgogi so I won't complain. It would also be nicer if the noodles were less greasy."}
{"text":"This is an interesting and fresh concept to have as a downtown restaurant.  There aren't many options for Korean or Korean inspired food in the area, so I was excited to check Bae's out.
They are open for lunch, and then close for two hours and open again for dinner.  I arrived right at 5 when they reopened and they weren't quite ready to be serving yet.  I was still able to order, but had to wait about 15 minutes for my food to be ready.  The staff told me it was because they were new and still getting the hang of things but then told me they had been open for nine weeks (so you think they'd be over growing pains by then).  They did give those of us waiting a few pieces of sweet potato tempura while we were waiting and that was a nice gesture.  
I liked that they explained the concept and what each main dish and side were without dumbing it down.  I decided to try the beef with glass noodles and sweet potato tempura.  I wasn't blown away by any of it, but I did really enjoy the meal.  The tempura was probably my favorite part.  They were the right balance of crispy and juicy and had a wonderful flavor.  The glass noodles were just ok.  I though they were fairly bland.  The beef was tender and had a nice amount of flavor with a hint of sweetness.  If I were to visit again I'd probably try the pork belly instead.
I was disappointed they didn't have the cucumbers.  Apparently they source them from someplace that doesn't currently have them available.  
I did enjoy my meal and will probably visit again.  It was filling and a nice mix of flavors.  I just thought almost $14 was a bit steep for the portions that you got."}
{"text":"Food: Good - The fried noodles and Korean chicken is flavorful and the meat is juicy. The fried egg plant is also amazing. I wish everything wasn't so greasy. If the grease stays on your lips, it's never a good sign.

Service: Great - You can be in and out of there in about 5-10minutes, even with a line. Staff is always friendly and willing to explain things to new explorers.

Overall: Recommend - If you're downtown or craving Korean, it's a great spot to grab a bite. It's nothing like what you would get in a bigger city like NYC, but it does the trick."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service.  I've had the bulgolgi, pork belly, and Korean fried chicken.   All tasty.  The Napa cabbage kim chi is tasty and bearable. Not as spicy as I'm used to. Definitely Korean-inspired, but good food.  The typical box lunch will run you $12-$15 with good sized portions.  First place I've been in that gas a donation in place of tips concept. Staff has always been friendly even when the line is backed out the door and down the street.  If it is backed out, don't be nervous.  The line moves quickly because of the counter food display set up."}
{"text":"Absolutely scrumptious. All of their menu items are delicious, high quality (organic!), and make me feel like I'm indulging even though I'm staying true to my healthy diet. As if that wasn't awesome enough - they have coffee!! It's the perfect stop for me between classes."}
{"text":"Very interesting! I went here for lunch because of a coworker recommendation. You get a lot of food for the price. I got the tofu with rice noodles and crab salad. They could probably only give 2 blocks of tofu and lower the price a tad. A little tofu goes a long way. I'll definitely be back though!"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch! I had the noodles and Korean Beef and the Vietnamese coffee Boba tea. I didn't. Love the coffee, but the food was great. Very flavorful, and pretty large. A little pricey, but good to treat yourself every once in a while!"}
{"text":"Came back to celebrate a friend coming into town.  We were first in line and the staff was quick to take our order and friendly.  After ordering it took 15-20 mins for each of our orders to show.  Two of us ordered Pork Belly.  The pork belly was no more than thin cuts of rubbery bacon.  If you are looking for quality food check else where or maybe give it a try...."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me as long as it did to give this place a try. One of my health-conscious coworkers frequents Bae Bae's on days he allows himself the treat of going out to eat for lunch, and I am very strict with myself about packing my lunch. I decided it was time to treat myself, too, and we went to Bae Bae's on a sunny Friday afternoon.

We walked in and got right in line. I love the cute terrariums and the bar you can sit at in the front of the restaurant. Places that are well-lit with natural lighting have a warm, comfortable feel about them and you get lots of natural light here.

Ordering here is super simple and you start with a choice of protein. You can choose from beef, pork belly, Korean fried chicken (KFC), and crispy tofu. Next, you choose two sides. Your first choice is between rice, salad greens or glass noodles, and the next choice is between tempura veggies, seaweed salad, or kimchi. You can get some sides of Kim Bob (almost like sushi but with any protein choice and veggies rolled up in rice and seaweed) or a daily special as an extra if you'd prefer that. One of my favorite things about the menu is that it's organic! This is a great place to go if you want something that tastes good, is good for you, and is affordable.

I'm always one to opt for chicken over beef and pork, but I like tofu, too. This time I decided on the KFC because my friend recommended it, and the pictures I've seen made it look incredible. For my sides I got the glass noodles and seaweed salad, which are two of my favorite things. You get a small side salad no matter what, so I still got my serving of veggies in! The chicken was perfectly crispy, and each box comes with two HUGE chicken strips with wasabi honey sauce. I'm a self-proclaimed condiment fanatic, and the honey wasabi was uniquely delicious in all the right ways.

Portion size here was also part of my decision to give Bae Bae's five stars as the box I got for about $12 was enough for me to get 2 solid meals out of it. I got a box exactly like the one I got to bring home to my boyfriend and he also loved everything about it. Needless to say, we'll be coming back to Bae Bae's, and the convenient downtown location makes this place a great choice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The girls at my hair salon all rave about Bae Bae's! So today I was off of work and since I had some appointments at the salon, I thought it would be a great excuse to try it out! I love the vibe in there! It's so cute! Everyone that works there is so nice and helpful! Being that it was my first time, I wasn't sure how to properly order (it's build your own) but the girl at the counter helped me with my selections. The guy behind the counter also seemed like a total sweetie!

I ordered the bulgogi, rice and kimchi cucumbers. It also came with some dressed mixed greens which made me happy because i wasn't sure i had ordered enough veggies! The bulgogi was good with sweet onions and scallions! It was a little bit greasy for me but I also think that is partially my fault for my selection knowing that I am not a big fan of greasy spoon meals. The cucumbers were awesome! And the greens were lightly dressed and refreshing!

I am definitely going to come back to Bae Bae's. I failed to mention there is a coffee bar and i got a really good iced latte! I may switch my order up but i was pleased overall!"}
{"text":"The crispy tofu was amazing. Very close to convention center and local hotels. Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Delicious, unique dining experience in downtown Pittsburgh. It was my first time at this dining spot the host was so friendly and helpful. He explained how you build your own plate. I chose a base of crystal noodles, protein of fried organic chicken breast and potatoes Salad side. They also give you fried sweet potatoes and salad. The food was fresh and delicious. I asked if I could taste the pork and that was delicious as well. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. Modern, clean and they support the Humane Society which I really like. I would recommend this place for lunch and great for take out too."}
{"text":"I was happy to see this place listed on Happy Cow as a vegan restaurant, but had to hurry as it was 7 pm and they closed at 8 pm. Good thing I stayed on Smallman Street and this was within walking distance. Parking downtown can be a nightmare and expensive to boot. 

The restaurant is rather small so you order and pay at the counter. The gentleman behind the counter was extremely pleasant, explaining their specials and the sides that I can choose from the \"Build a bowl\" concept, which I opted for. My side was a seaweed salad. Never had it so thought I would try it. 

Delivery of the food was very quick and the price not too bad. It was served in a cardboard container so you can quickly leave if a fire breaks out or some other catastrophe so I appreciated that. The plastic utensils were flimsy enough to be safe on any flight so no need to worry about stabbing anyone with the knife as it bent as I cut my tofu into smaller cubes. 

The food was very good and plentiful. The seaweed was interesting. Would I get it again...maybe after a couple of glasses of wine. Not that it was bad, it was just too oceanic for me. I ate it anyway. 

Overall, I loved the scene and the food so I would certainly go back again."}
{"text":"Cute and charming downtown spot for Korean food. This was my first Korean restaurant experience and I enjoyed everything! The crispy tofu was delicious (and I normally don't like tofu too much), and the fried chicken was good too. It's Korean food made accessible (pick a base, pick a protein, pick a side)."}
{"text":"I wish we had one back home because this place is AMAZING! Came in for lunch during a weekday and wasn't too busy. The place is quite small, but they do have more seating in the back. It's set up like a qdoba/mod pizza, but Korean food. You pick a protein, then rice/noodles, then a small side like kimchi or cucumber kimchi. It also came with couple of these like fried sweet potato and a salad, which were both delicious! Everything tasted SO fresh and yummy! Really, everything was SO good! 

It seems they do change menus... and the lunch and dinner are different also. 

The atmosphere is beautiful inside with tons of plants/flowers. They also don't accept tips, instead donations for dogs...which is another great thing about this place. I will DEF stop in anytime in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I hate to be one of the first to give this place a rating that isn't fantastic but I have to be honest about my recent experience. After my coworker and fellow yelper told me about a new place opening by work I was thrilled to check it out. After seeing the great yelp reviews and having someone stop me on the street to tell me how good it was, I thought for sure it had to be amazing. Sadly I was left very disappointing.

The place itself is definitely very small so this isn't a place for big parties. Food is served in to go boxes so I think the general idea is that most will take their food back to the office with them. The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute. What fell really short for me was the food and service. The staff was extremely slow serving and ringing out customers. Of course this place is new so that's expected as they work out some of the kinks but being part of the downtown lunch scene means you really need to get that part right so people can quickly return to work. 

After much debating I ended up going with the KFC (fried chicken) with glass noodles. The chicken was cooked absolutely perfectly I will say but what really disappointed me most was the daily sauce they gave you with the chicken. It has a very strange taste almost like it had alcohol in it. It wasn't even edible in my opinion. The noodles were probably the best part of my lunch. One of the other things that sadly left me a little disappointed was the fact that they were just out of particular side dishes. I was extremely excited to try the cucumber kimchi and they didn't have any for that day. 

With all of that being said I would probably give it another try and possibly go with the beef next time. I would still recommend everyone check it out because others seem to really like it and everyone has different opinions."}
{"text":"Loved Bae Bae's Kitchen! Visited for the first time during Jazz Fest. The service was great - everyone was friendly and helpful. 

They offer build-you-own bowl style food which includes a base, a protein, a salad and a side. I tried the noodles, chicken bulgogi and kimchi. The food comes in a to-go box... which you will definitely need because the portion size is huge!!! The food was delicious. The chicken bulgogi had a nice flavor and the noodles were good even though they were a bit greasy. I was glad that a salad was included because it helped to freshen it up! We also tried some of the bigger side options that did not come with the meal including a fried cheese soze

I really enjoyed the space. I sat along the front window surrounded by plants and was able to people watch! I would definitely return and try some other options."}
{"text":"The outside of the restaurant is very unassuming, we actually walked passed it trying to find the location. The store front is small, they have seating in a back room. The inside is nicely designed, very trendy. Based on reviews and the look of the place I was very excited to try the food. I got noodles, bbq pork and bean sprouts along with a Thai tea boba. We waited for fresh noodles and pork to be made. I was very let down by my meal. I can't do very spicy foods and unfortunately you can't customize your order that way. The noodles were very spicy as was the pork which I couldn't even eat. I was not confident that the pork was fully cooked, plus it was mostly fat! I love Thai tea and I love bubble tea, together I was hoping it would be a nice treat but the beverage was watered down and tasteless. This place really let me down. I will say I like that they collect their tips and donate them to the Humane society."}
{"text":"OVERALL: this is the definition of Korean fusion done right. Great tasting bulgogi and rice, with authentic kimchi and a healthy salad on the side. Cute environment and super friendly service. A bit expensive for the portion size, though - $13 for bulgogi. 

I was excited to come here due to the reviewers on Yelp loving Bae Bae's. I came right as it opened at 11:30am, and was surprised at how green and lovely the ambience was. There were so many plants in the restaurant, creating a calm and serene natural atmosphere. It was also very colorful and aesthetically-pleasing. 

The food itself was great. The bulgogi was marinated perfectly, albeit a tad too sweet for me. It had a distinct Korean flavor, which made me extremely happy, because I'm usually not a fan of fusion food. The kimchi was also well-made and fresh, and the rice was good too - sticky and warm. I usually dislike salads, but was able to finish all of my salad at Bae Bae's. It complemented the flavor of the bulgogi very well, and the crisp, fresh vegetables was a great contrast to the heavy, flavorful meat. The meal left me 110% full, yet refreshed at the same time. 

I will definitely come back here again! As I said before, it's kind of expensive for the portion size, but it's an amazing option for healthy Korean fusion food that manages to keep its authentic flavor as well."}
{"text":"Yum!  You choose a base (rice, noodles, or salad), a protein (beef, chicken, pork belly, tofu) and a side (kimchi, cucumber kimchi, etc).  I had the pork belly on salad with kimchi.  Delish! 
Cute atmosphere.  Wish I had come earlier in the day to try their Vietnamese coffee or Thai ice tea."}
{"text":"I'd been eyeing this place for a while and I finally decided to come on a Monday afternoon. We arrived right before the lunch hour rush began and snagged the window table with a lovely view of the sunlight pouring through the spring leaves on the street. I'd highly recommend sitting there if you can, it was nice to feel the sun and take in the atmosphere of the hanging plants. There's additional seating in the back too, but I personally like natural lighting.

Not being too hungry, my friend and I decided to share the KFC as our main entree. I wanted to try their wings alone, but they were sold out of these at that point in the month. We got the noodles  and tempura veggies as a side. There was a wasabi sauce that accompanied it, but I asked for if there were any other ones and the guy at checkout kindly handed me a plum sauce. I personally enjoyed the plum sauce more than the wasabi one. 

The food itself was really good. The combination of the fried parts with the crisp salad and cold noodles helped satisfy my craving. If I would go back and change something I might have gotten the beef instead of chicken to reduce the amount of oil, but it wasn't too overwhelming and I didn't feel heavy or gross after eating it. The chicken was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside, i kept wanting to take more bites. And to know that these ingredients have good origins also helped my conscious.

We also got ginger beer and bubble tea as drinks $4 each. They weren't the greatest compliments, or at least not worth their price. But it was a good experiment. I'd still go to chick n bubbly for my bubble tea.

Overall, I had high expectations going in and I believe that they were met. The ambiance, the food, the price, it was worth it for a fulfilling meal. Definitely would come back to try their wings when they're back in stock!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Healthful-ish Korean cuisine-based meals served up with a smile. For the uninitiated, the ordering process isn't too awky, but might be made less so by speaking to the counter person around the side of the glass divider, as opposed to trying to speak thru or over it. Just read the notes on the blackboard and you'll be in there like swimwear. I might be as white as rice but their Napa cabbage kimchi was some of the best I've ever enjoyed. It was light, crisp, tangy, zesty and tart. My vegetarian dining partner and I agreed that if this place was near where we lived, we would both happily enjoy a meal or three from this place every week - guilt free."}
{"text":"Sort of pricey korean-fusion food, makes sense since they offer vegan options, which is why it probably didn't satisfy me the way a good ol' spread of banchan and real (yes not the katsu-kind) KFC does.  My fault for expecting otherwise, I knew the photos looked too healthy!

Really small container of kimchi :(
No kimbap, apparently that's made by owners whim, which is actually the reason I went. :(

Service was wonderful though, girl behind counter took the time to explain all the items.  My (katsu-like) KFC was made fresh with a cool wasabi-honey sauce.  It's nice but I'm team sweet-soy or gochujang KFC forever.

I think its a great place if you're looking for some lighter-fare or korean-vegan, which is rare.  Not for me though! I welcome diabetes."}
{"text":"This is another place I was excited about.  Ever since the previous restaurant there closed (Umbrella Cafe, a favorite of mine since I moved in), the empty storefront made me sad to walk by.  I had been monitoring the space for a while and knew a place called Bae Bae's Kitchen was opening up, but it had been hard to find much information about it.  I had no idea it had opened until I walked by today.  Korean food is one of my favorites, so I was thrilled to try it.

I had a plate with the special egg and onion fried rice and bulgogi with one side dish (I chose seaweed salad) for $13.  I was also given a cup of kimchi and some miso soup and Thai iced tea.  All the food was delicious.  I especially liked the bulgogi.

The service here was very friendly, even when an influx of people came in.  The ordering was convenient... you just go up to the counter where they display the options for your plates (or grab and go items such as kimbap).  If I had one complaint about my experience, it would be that the pork belly advertised on the menu was not available today.  But it is understandable, as they are just starting out.  I will definitely be back.  This is a worthy successor to the Umbrella Cafe."}
{"text":"I am currently visiting Pittsburgh, PA, and I found Bae Bae's Kitchen on Yelp as a suggestion.  The service, selection of quality of food, the authenticity of the food I ordered, and the politeness of the staff was highly impressive and unbeatable.  Before I left the restaurant, I mentioned to two of the men working there, they should inform their manager that they will receive an excellent review from me on Yelp.  They were both delighted, and we departed all with smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"This place has been bookmarked for me since it opened. I went on sat night and walked 3 blocks in 9 degree weather. So worth it. Most positive food experience I have had in a long time. Was working down Liberty Ave trying to find it. No big signs but recognized the lights/plants from a photo from here. Went in and go to the counter. Super friendly staff explained how to order. Got the last Beef (went at 6:30 and sold out already) but was ok because the pork belly was equally as good. My sister said fried chicken was really good as well. The chicken was served with a wasabi/honey sauce-SO GOOD. No sure if you can ask for a side of it but it was delicious with the sweet potatoes. I would still recommend getting the beef first if they have it. Meals came out after 10-15 minutes. They don't look like much but are so filling. I had to take some home, but luckily tasted just as good the next day. The only disappointment was the overpriced tea/coffee. But I say it's worth a try if you never had Vietnamese coffee before. I can't wait to go back. It was that good."}
{"text":"I can declare the my first visit to Bae Bae's Kitchen will not be my last! The cashier, Daniel, (he made me feel like a welcomed guest, every time a went to talk to him he called me by name) guided me on the different choices. I decided to create my own plate. You start with either: rice, noodles (clear) or salad. 2nd pick a protein: organic grass braised short ribs, Korean fried chicken, organic bbq pork belly, or organic crispy tofu. 3rd pick a side dish: kimchi, seaweed salad or sweet potatoes (thinly sliced, tempura battered and fried)

My choices were: noodles, chicken, and the sweet potatoes. The meal came with a tossed salad that had a mildly flavored chili dressing. There was also a wasabi sauce ( this will clear your sinuses for sure) on the side to dip your chicken in. 

I want to describe this food as Korean comfort food! The two large pieces of chicken was tender and crispy and so were the multiple pieces of sweet potatoes. The noodles were lightly seasoned and a perfect accompaniment to the rest of the meal and the salad was a good balance to the meal. 

The meal was well worth the price and so fulfilling!"}
{"text":"Never have had anything less than delicious! Great vegan options and meat choices so there's something for everyone! The owner says hi to me by name & makes your guests feel welcome as well. I always go for the organic crispy tofu with glass noodles & vegetable tempura with plum sauce! Friendly staff, amazing food, chill atmosphere: Bae Bae's is a welcome addition downtown!"}
{"text":"Aesthetic: Small and cozy.  The decorations and lighting feels more like a hipster coffee shop than a restaurant, but it is aesthetically pleasing.  

Ordering and wait times:  We went at an off time and there was a minimal wait.  Once, placing the order the food took 5 - 10 mins, which is reasonable, but longer than I thought considering the food was already out infront. 

Taste:  Food was clean and not overpowering.  They avoided the typical pitfall of every other Korean restaurants in Pittsburgh and restaurants in general of overseasoning the food.  We had the spicy crab kimbab with soft tofu and a bowl with japchae and fried tofu.  Both were tasty, but would not recommend if you are looking for a authentic korean food experience.  Regardless, food tastes good.  

Price: Slightly on the pricey side, but given location and organic sourcing prices are fair and expected.  

Overall:  Would return and recommend.  First, Korean restaurant in Pittsburgh area that I would want to return to."}
{"text":"This place is adorable.  Full of terrariums, cacti, and plants galore.  It's charming decor is inviting and the menu is small but pack full of flavor.  The staff are welcoming and keep you well informed on all the delicious noms.  They have all the food displayed in front of you so you know exactly what you're getting.  My fiancé and I got two bowls.  1) Noodles, KFC chicken, seaweed salad, micro greens, and fried sweet potatoes (plus an intense wasabi honey mustard. 2) Rice, crab salad, pork belly, micro greens, and crispy fried sweet potatoes.  I'd love to go again when their menu changes for the next season."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan options! Had the tofu and rice noodles. I'll be back here many times for sure."}
{"text":"Other reviews were fairly accurate. Some quick things to note. It's downtown so it's hard to find parking at any time, also there is no sign above the restaurant. As for the food, I had the Korean Fried Chicken with rice and tempura sweet potatoes. The chicken was cooked well but not seasoned enough, rice was perfect, and sweet potatoes surprisingly tasty. I would go back. But honestly it didn't blow me away. It's a bit on the high side for lunch, ~$13-15."}
{"text":"Small high quality selection to choose. Everything taste fresh. We order pork belly and KFC with Thai tea. Overall good but hidden in downtown."}
{"text":"this place is amazing! very vegan/veg friendly! i got the tofu with glass noodles, it was big enough for my partner and i to split! holy hell it was delicious! bulgogi is super hard to find vegan, this spot blew my mind. very reasonably priced, a small and 
family business really trying to show their beautiful style of cooking. you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place! Stellar customer service and well decorated. Lots of plants and a nice vibe. I got the tofu salad + kimchi side + squash tempura. The tofu was some of the best I've ever had. We went yesterday for lunch for the first time and we're going back today, which tells you all you need to know about how much I loved it."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends during Light Up Night. Overall: 4/5. Details below.

Decor: 5/5 for a dainty coffee house style. Food is displayed right in front of you as you order, like Chipotle.
Music: 5/5 for being on point with classics (Spotify playlist- \"Songs to Sing in the Shower\")
Food presentation: 4/5 organized in a to go box
Flavor: 4/5 Daeji was alright, wasn't spicy as expected. KFC was flavorful and a bit salty. Vietnamese coffee wasn't as sweet as expected, but is strong. Thai iced tea was a bit watered down. 
Price: 3/5 a bit too much for a college student's wallet.
Service: 5/5 very polite and pleasant employees.
Bathrooms: 4/5 really spacious.

Would I come back again?
No, unless I was bringing a friend from out of town to try out Pittsburgh foods. 

Really pleasant place that was a bit expensive, but I enjoyed my time there."}
{"text":"The tofu skin I had today for lunch was excellent, and everyone I was with was please with the chicken and bulgogi! So so tasty! And a ery nicely decorated spot to have lunch. The back room is quieter and calmer. I totally love Bae Bae's!"}
{"text":"Great portions and good vegan options stand out. I didn't love the tempura veggies because they didn't travel well but the tofu and glass noodles were delicious"}
{"text":"Said open till 3 but closed at 2 and I drove all this way how rude!!!!! Why did they have to do this and in pride."}
{"text":"Stopped by while I was visiting Pittsburgh and I'm glad I did. A little pricey for a lunch but worth every bite and was super filling! I had the bowl with the Korean fried chicken (not your drumstick fare with beer on the side) which was a fried fillet. The meal came with wasabi dressing which was something I never knew I needed, so good but don't underestimate the spice (it's still wasabi with a kick). The owners were sweet and if I'm ever back in Pittsburgh I will be here again."}
{"text":"Really cool vibe in this place. The guy at the front who served us was very friendly and happy to gush about the food! Very good portion size and the Korean fried chicken is crisp and tasty. Fast casual and kids loved it!"}
{"text":"I was strolling downtown and came upon bae baes kitchen so I stopped in for lunch. The staff explained how to order and everything that was available to choose from. I chose glass noodles, two giant pork meatballs in Asian sauce, cucumber kimchi, and tempura sweet potatoes. The box also came with a side salad. The meal was enormous and worth the $12. I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce on the pork, but the actual meat could have been more tender and seasoned. The cucumber kimchi and sweet potatoes were both tasty as well. I thought about saving some for a second meal but I ate the whole thing. They had some other tasty sounding proteins like spicy fried chicken, pork ribs, tofu etc.. I will definitely go back. I was excited to see a new lunch spot added downtown."}
{"text":"Yesterday I finally did it. I was going to meet a friend for dinner and I said we should come here. It has been on my radar for months and when I finally have the chance of being downtown this was a place I knew I had to pick. I was really excited when my friend agreed with me and we made a date for Bae Bae's Kitchen. After hearing all the hype from all the other reviewers and from my friends who live downtown I was excited. And I will say they lived up to the hype. When I walked in they were just opening for their dinner at 5 PM. Since my friend was not there yet the man behind the counter was kind enough to explain, in incredible detail, all of the choices that were in front of me for dinner. He was so friendly and incredibly  thorough it was great. 

The atmosphere inside was very homey. I love all the plants on the walls and in the window. I will say that it was a bit chilly inside but not so much that it was distracting.

So when my friend got there we went up to order. And I got the glass noodles, with the Korean Fried Chicken, the seaweed salad, and the Bulgogi Kimbap. The noodles and kimbap both came with a salad and the kimbap also came with miso soup. 

I have to say that everything that I ate was amazing. The orders come out pretty quickly and the food was great. There was even enough for me to save for lunch the next day. Any time that you go out and they give you enough food for lunch as well as your meal at the time is good in my book. The sauces that came with the Korean Fried Chicken, Wasabi honey sauce, was the most amazing thing that I've had on chicken in a long time. The chicken was also fried to perfection with a delicious panko breading. The chicken also was organic so you can take that how you may. All I know is it was delicious. We also got some of the vegetable tempura. This was also very good. It was a mixture of sweet potatoes and squash. Again fried to perfection with a lovely panko breading. I dipped it in my honey Wasabi sauce yummy.

I look forward to coming back to try more on their menu. This place really does live up to its hype. I will come back just because the service was so very friendly. The menu is also great and I cannot wait to try more things on it."}
{"text":"It's a Korean restaurant (more like a cafe) that serves lunch box type food. Portion is generous, and lunch boxes are pretty. But as a Korean, I feel like the food here is too westernized."}
{"text":"The Korean fried chicken is the best chicken I've ever had. I love how they donate all tips to the humane society as well!  Awesome lunch spot"}
{"text":"This place is soooo cute. The ambiance and the decor is so chill and relaxing. It's a place where you can make your own bowl of different delicious items. I had the the noodles with fried tofu and the crab salad side. So good. I was impressed. I have never had fried tofu before and I didn't know what to expect but it was really good. We also got a side of veggie tempura which came with this creamy spicy sauce. I really enjoyed this place. It's organic and uses local food items. Must try for Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Bae Bae's Kitchen serves up Korean-fusion food in a fast-casual environment. While having a limited menu, the execution on everything is near flawless. 

I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken with Glass Noodles and a side Spicy Crab Salad, and every order comes with a side salad in a spicy vinaigrette dressing. The attention given to the quality of ingredients and presentation is phenomenal, especially for a fast casual location. The Korean Fried Chicken comes with 2 chicken breasts, and is coated in panko and lightly fried till golden brown, yet remains far from oily (a huge plus!). The KFC also came with a cup of Honey Wasabi dipping sauce that was very unique and incredibly tasty. The sweetness of the honey comes through and finishes with the tingling and small kick of Wasabi. Even if you're not a fan of Wasabi, I highly recommend giving this sauce a try - it tasted exceptional on everything!The Glass Noodles I think were my favorite option at Bae Bae's - they're incredibly tender and the large chunks of onions and scallions sautéed in sesame oil is just as good as it sounds. The Spicy Crab salad was actually spicy and went great with the KFC. They have a ton of other offerings as a \"side option\" such as Cucumber Kim chi, vegetable tempura, etc. 

They also offer a daily special - I think the day I visited they were serving Pork and Rice, but I think you have less customizability with the daily specials as I couldn't swap out the Rice for Glass Noodles. I can't wait to go back soon and see what other daily specials they offer.
 
This was my first time to Bae Bae's Kitchen, but it will definitely not be my last visit."}
{"text":"I had the vegan options for dinner and it was filling and yummy.   They even gave me an extra side for free just because.

The staff is friendly and family operated.   

They do not accept tips and instead donate that \"tip\" money to a local animal charity.   I love that.

The restaurant has a quiet and not overwhelming atmosphere.

I'm definitely going back and I hope that they thrive as a business and stay open for years."}
{"text":"We went in at 11:30 right at the opening time. They were still setting up everything. The service was very nice, the lady at the counter asked if we were vegan/vegetarian as we ordered tofu for our protein and suggested vegetarian sides that we could pick. Our order came out pretty fast.The only issue was with the food, the tofu was cut into big chunks and was sweet. The offered us hot sauce when requested. The tofu tasted best with rice noodles instead of rice. 

The place has great succulent garden and cozy ambiance to it. Not to forget great customer service."}
{"text":"I have to say, the environment of this place is dope, but it's really pricy. As an Asian, the food tastes just like Asian fusion fast food. We order a lot of food, including KFC chicken rice combo and noodles beef combo, miso soup, hot tea and sweet potato tempura. Totally 37.45 dollars! The seaweed salad is not seaweed! It mixes with cucumber, green pepper and carrots. Tell me where is seaweed? A normal camomile tea three dollars!? Miso soup tastes like the soup you can make by yourself. Chicken got no flavor in. I don't know why they call it KFC chicken... The waitress is super nice. The only thing makes me feel better."}
{"text":"Fabulous add to the downtown Pittsburgh lunch options!

Lovely staff cooking scratch-made Korean family recipes.  A very approachable menu with well-explained items.  Had the glass noodles with vegetables, their Korean fried chicken (a boneless cutlet with a panko-style breading) and plum sauce, and a side of their kimchi, which I was assured was their grandmother's recipe.  Everything was delicious, light, fresh and not at all greasy.  The bulgogi and fried tofu looked delicious as well, and I can't wait to go back.

Seating is limited, but the takeout packaging is excellent.

This is an exciting new add with delicious food.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So, I've been here twice now and both times gotten the same thing. Love Bae Bae's! I got the glass noodles with KFC and Napa kimchi. Also, their iced coffee/tea with boba is awesome. The service is friendly and love the atmosphere! I went with friends on a weekday the first time which I probably won't do again because seating is limited. The second time I went on a Sunday after church around 12pm and the place was dead. Will go back around a similar time next time and get something else totally yummy!"}
{"text":"Place is amazing!! What a great ass to the area finally my craving for some good korean food has been met !"}
{"text":"Wow! New favorite Korean place in Pittsburgh. I'm really digging all the Express style restaurants that Pittsburgh has added in this past year. I've been wanted to try it and have heard it's good. Today I came with my friend, and they really don't disappoint. We got there right when they opened on a Saturday, and booooy it's already packed. Popular place! We both got bulgogi and japchae. Not only their food was freshly made and delicious, but their customer service was excellent! The guy that served us was so sweet and helpful. Even though you only get one side, I couldn't decide which side I wanted he let me try one extra side. And we also got to try tempura sweet potatoes. By the time we sat down to eat, there was a line already. I am so excited to bring my other friends here. Also, this place is also dangerously close to where I live. Haha 
Next time I want to try their Korean fried chicken or the crispy tofu! Oh my they both look amazing and they seem like the popular options too. It is safe to say I'll definitely be returning sooooon!"}
{"text":"Cute new lunch spot downtown. It brings a unique flair to the typical restaurants you'll see around here. They offer essentially a build-your-own rice/noodle bowl. For vegetarians, they have a fried tofu option, but I was not overly impressed with the bland and unseasoned taste. It was fairly average quality food and portions were not enough to keep me full. 

For a fast casual style restaurant, they still need to work on the fast part. The long lines are caused by the slow pace of getting people served. Since they're so new, they're probably working out the kinks. Another downfall is that they run out of food too quickly. I was there less than 2 hours after they opened and they were already out of half of their menu items."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but I had an amazing vegan meal here! The tofu is incredible and the plum sauce goes well with it. The ingredients are really fresh!!! Plus it's very affordable to have a healthy meal."}
{"text":"Intimate setting but with enough seating. We got the bulgogi plate with glass noodles and kimchi. Everything was super tasty and very fresh. The salad dressing was a little strong, so if you're not a huge fan of vinaigrette maybe ask for that on the side. They do donations instead of tips which I think is pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was totally alright. I was at the convention center and stopped in for lunch. The line was a little long and the price a little high but the food was certainly of quality. It was worth trying for sure, but i wasn't blown away by top notch interesting cuisine.

I had the KBBQ and got a resonably large portion of food in a fast casual setting without any fuss. I guess what i'm really trying to convey with this is that I had no issues or exciting moments when eating this food. Generally 3 star reviews are the hardest to write because this place was generic to the point of it being mostly non memorable, which, is both a good and a bad thing. You should try it, but if you don't go back that's essentially what I was thinking would happen."}
{"text":"I have been watching this space since The Umbrella Cafe left and was happy to see something new in the space. The décor is the same bright airy décor with a front counter showing the available dishes. A few sides like glass noodle and rice, followed by proteins of beef, pork, chicken and vegetarian options, followed by extras like kimchi and crab salad. You create a meal from those options and they also have tea and coffee. 

I have to say that I was really hopeful but not impressed by this place. The service was great and I was greeted with a smile. The restaurant was clean and full but I did not wait long. 

However, the food was on par with your basic run of the mill Asian buffet food. It was lukewarm to start and the glass noodle dish was barely spiced. The bulgogi was uninspired and had a gummy texture. I was really looking forward to this dish as I had great bulgogi from the Mr bulgogi food truck the week prior. This was not even close. Its as if they used less spice to appeal to taste and I understand that. It could also be the lunch rush and I will go back again later in the day to give them another chance but this was not better than a panda express. 

I was really hopeful that this would bring traditional Korean to downtown and they could get there but right now they are missing the mark."}
{"text":"Not a ton of options but everything I at was bomb. Hella vegan options. Yelp is dumb for trying to police how short my review is. I ate good food and had no problem. Eat here if you are in Pitt looking for healthy options"}
{"text":"I'm visiting Pittsburgh and I love trying new food places. This place was great! The food was delivered quickly it was very hot, flavorful, and a good portion size. The price was also quite affordable. It was so good I would consider going again during my trip."}
{"text":"The food was fine but not great, but an entree and bubble tea cost me twenty dollars and for that price i expected far more. For that price i could have gone to a sit-down restaurant and ordered something far better, or taken the bus to oakland to get korean there. Portion sizes for rice and side salad were good but the meat portion was comparatively small, again, especially for the price. I think i also caught the end of a batch and so it had been sitting out for a while, which maybe didn't help the available portion or the flavor. I really love Korean, and wanted to love this place, but i was just disappointed. Don't see myself coming back."}
