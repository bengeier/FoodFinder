{"text":"You had me at $6.99 all you can eat lunch.  Love the price but of course you get what you pay for.  I recommend going during peak times since the hot food and sushi is fresher.  Sushi can be dried out, but there is a big variety.

Best advice I have is: find a few things you really like and don't worry about the rest.  I like their noodle dishes, mushroom beef, egg and spring rolls, coconut shrimp.  Didn't like the sweet and sour chicken and of course not the desserts (don't know why they bother with that!)  However, you can make it a pretty tasty lunch for less than many of the fast food combo meals cost.  How can you complain about that?

Also, some people said they only saw fat Americans in here.  Each time I've been there (which has been probably 5 times now) there are lots of Asian folks eating.  

Last, why do people expect this to be super authentic Japanese/Chinese fare?  This is the Midwest....and it is a strip mall buffet....I didn't come here to be awed by the food."}
{"text":"Like this place. Don't have to wait and the manager there is nice. The clam is my favorite! Other Chinese entries are authentic too. But the sushi is not that good though. If you want to find a clean and quiet place for dinner, this place worth try."}
{"text":"It is an OK chinese buffet, the price is very reasonable $6.99 for lunch. We like their mini egg custard."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here for lunch on 3/15. We loved it and will go back again. I have nothing but kudos for the food and service. They had crawfish and awesome shrimp. There was nothing that I could say was bad. People are too picky. For $6.99 for lunch...all you can eat... If you complain...stay home as evidently your cooking is supreme. As for me and my friend, we will definitely let them do the cooking. The service was wonderful."}
{"text":"I have to laugh even though this is pretty disgusting. I was there for the lunch buffet and as I was getting some food, a piece of chicken from what I was getting fell on the counter in front of the trays that hold the food. I moved on. Next thing I know, one of the workers walks by, picks it up  with bare hands and threw it back in the tray of food while I stood and watched the whole thing. I also noticed the food and selection is not as good as when they first opened.  I dont think I will be going back there."}
{"text":"I had never been here before and I was really craving hibachi for lunch. I was really impressed with the variety of food they had. Like I always do when I go to a new place, I grabbed just a little bit of each of my favorite items. I was really excited about the hibachi. When I got to my table and started trying everything I was so disappointed. All of my normal buffet items tasted bad. The chicken on a stick was basically fat with a little meat on a stick, the shrimp in the hibachi was off. So much I spit it out. The whole time I was trying to eat, there were 3 waitresses standing about 3 feet from my table and pouncing on tables that had finished eating. I let my waitress know that the shrimp in the Hibachi was bad. She said she was sorry, left, and when she returned she had my check for $12. You could tell I didn't eat my food. I had a bit of pudding and a little piece of cake, with a Coke. Yep that was $12. No discount for a good portion of my food being discussing and uneatable. Needless to say... I told everyone I work with, everyone on my Facebook, about this place. Be wear... Do not have high expectations. Oh yeah, sushi... That's a joke. It was all fake crab combinations."}
{"text":"I still have mix feelings about this place!! So I'm giving it a 3 star rating. We started to go here because it was a lot closer to our home. It is in a weird location and doesn't seem very appealing from the outside. However, this is one of the fewer buffet that is unique from others. They have a larger selection of food choices. They have some different dishes that other Chinese buffet do not offer on top of still offering your typical dish, a decent selection of sushi and hibachi. If you are in the area and looking for a Chinese buffet to dine, I would recommend you give this one a try!"}
{"text":"I had been there twice since the opening.  It's a Chinese buffet with sushi bar, not a Japanese buffet!  The quality of the sushi was as I expected, but it's ok with the price they charged.  Chinese dishes were subpar.  My wait staff were quick to clean the plates at both occasions.  

It's good for cheap lunch, and I plan to go back once in a while, but it's not my favorite."}
{"text":"My new favorite buffet place it was amazing everything i ate was cooked perfect they have great sushi prime rib and a hibachi station. prices are amazing 4.99 for lunch and 9.99 for dinner i really hope this place sticks around"}
{"text":"Normally I would say that, if you're eating at a place like this, you probably aren't checking Yelp reviews first.  But my wife and I got the coupon in the mail, and were intrigued.  We checked the reviews, they seemed okay.  The pictures looked okay.  

It was not very good.  The decor was nice enough but the mood in the place was .. subdued.  No one was talking, really, no one was happy to be there.  Not the staff and not the other customers.  It was a bit grim overall.

The food itself did not inspire happiness.  I don't have high expectations for buffet sushi - you get what you pay for - but this was just weird.  The rice was almost doughy and the fish was cut in weird ways.  It was the strangest sushi I've ever had. Not in a good way.

Okay, well, what about the Chinese buffet staples?  Most of them were there - crab legs, fried chicken in a variety of sauces, egg drop soup.   They were okay but not inspiring.  The sauces all tasted the same and everything had a weird aftertaste.  Some of the fried chicken pieces had little bone fragments in them, which is not very appetizing.  

Did not get the teppan bar.

The sweet and sour soup was pretty good and - since I had a sour throat at the time - helped with that.  However, the gloomy atmosphere and greasy, heavy food mean that I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Good sushi, hot and sour soup, sauces, egg roll ,    veg-combos, noodles, fruit, & ice cream. Nicely presented and healthfully cooked."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese restaurant in town!

My Chinese office mate recommended it as the best in town. Was she right!

Delicious, awesome food. I'm definitely going back, and taking loads of people with me. It was the cleanest restaurant I've been to in a while.

Sushi, oysters, crawfish, frog legs (first time I've ever had such food), even ice cream!

Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"was thrilled a new place opened, but it fell short of my expectations...first off, the exterior of the building could use some work...I don't know if they rushed to open the place, but it helps if the establishment looks good also from the outside...next, the hostess placed us in a rotten/bad seating...hostess mistake, when you have so many available tables, you do not do this to a customer...I told her, we are moving to another table and she had a vinaigrette face...I didn't care...on the inside, the place looked ok, until I saw the cigarette smoke stains/or mold on the celing from the prior business...look at the ceiling by where the TV is at...the food, some things were good, spare ribs, crabs, desserts, but I will stop there...the fried rice was tasteless...why even have it out there unless its a filler...the beef and broccoli was ok, it would have been better if it was hot and not luke warm...the fried chicken, dry and day old...the egg roll, pretty bad...they must've made it themselves...why, not standard size...you taste a lot of the wrappings instead of whats on the inside...hot and sour soup, too liquidity, not hearty at all...

the service was ok, but who just goes for the service if the food is not good...by the time we were leaving, people were packing in the place...don't know if they were just trying the place cause its new, or really liked it...I will say this, usually I will spend about an hour eating at a buffet, this place, I was done in 38 minutes...

I will never go there again, not worth the time or money...next day I went to Hibachi Grill to redeem my taste buds...

for those of you who will not heed my words of warning and venture to this place...I cum Deo...translation, Go With God...wear a cross and do a couple of hail marys also before you go!"}
{"text":"Ichiban Buffet had its grand opening the other day. I figured this would be a good time to grab two of my kids and try out the new place. We were not disappointed.

The lunch buffet price was $6.99. This restaurant, which is next to the Schnuck's off Mattis Avenue, has had several tenants over the years, most recently a different Chinese buffet. The restaurant can seat quite a few people and appeared to have a pretty decent crowd that came in to give it a try at its opening.

The food was typical for a local Chinese buffet -- similar to Chinatown Buffet. Aside from the usual assortment of Chinese dishes, there was an extensive assortment of sushi -- approximately 25 different kinds. There was a station to create your own stir fry that would then be cooked by a chef, but no one used it in the time we were there. The dessert bar was similar to other Chinese buffets.

While there was nothing that seemed to jump out at me as being over-the-top excellent, I would say that almost everything I ate was very good. The only subpar item I had was a small piece of fried chicken that was dry and did not have enough seasoning.

I was pleased to see some seaweed salad available and an interesting dish, cabbage with bacon, was very good.

Seating was prompt, drinks were delivered quickly, and empty plates were carried away in a reasonable amount of time.

There was a sign at the counter saying that carry out sushi was $8.25/lb. If someone were looking to take home a variety of sushi, Ichiban would appear to be a solid choice.

Things seemed very well organized for a new restaurant. It is much closer to my home than other Chinese buffet choices, meaning this place has the potential to become a regular family stop."}
{"text":"I was going by to check out the spot. My wife an I fell in love with the place. Man off the rip packed, and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"This buffet is OK. I went here for lunch and the food is mediocre. I would only go to the place for a quick lunch and not for dinner. The price is reasonable and this side of town was in desperate need of a buffet, hopefully this place last long because this building has been a million and 1 different restaurants. I would not say this is best place to eat but if your looking to grab a quick lunch meal for affordable rate then Ichiban would be the place."}
{"text":"if you go here expecting a full on japanese buffet, you'll be disappointed.  i know i was.  i love japanese food.... but there was very little of it on this buffet.

i got some sushi.  i had some soup.  my husband got the made to order teppanyaki, and it was just so so.  there was not enough sauce, not enough choices for ingredients, and honestly, i felt like the guy making it wanted to be doing anything else.  

the things on the buffet seemed to be refilled frequently, and it all looked fresh.  the sushi did look like it had been sitting awhile, and without any sort of name tags above them, i had to guess what was in each roll.  there never seemed to be anyone working that area of the buffet, so it was not possible to ask either.  

the wait staff were nice.  they were attentive and refilled drinks/cleared the table often.  they smiled at my 3 year old son who was systematically dissecting sushi rolls on his plate.  

the chinese food on the buffet was almost entirely meat dishes.  there was no tofu or anything, which left us disappointed.  the food was really as americanized as it could be.  i felt like i was at panda express, except that it was more reasonably priced, which helped to buffer the disappointment.  

i don't think i'll be back, and for no real reason beside the fact that it was not a japanese buffet.  it's akin to other buffets in town, like chinatown.  if you enjoy chinatown, you'll like ichiban."}
{"text":"It says something about a Chinese buffet when the prime rib is one of the better items. The buffet food is ok but does not jump out though I really liked some kind of pork soup they had last time. I found some of the items not as warm as they should be. I found the mongolian BBQ disappointing the 2 times we went. Both times I asked for the spicy sauce & it wasn;t spicy at all. Very pleasant decor. As I shop at Schnuck's a lot I see the steady traffic this place has. My wife liked her food more than I being more of a seafood eater. But we don't eat out all that much & this place falls a bit short for our dollar."}
{"text":"I re-name this place Ickybad!!  There is nothing here that I found good.  Granted, Chinese food is not one of my favorites but usually when I have to endure one of these places there is something I can at least say was edible or even good.  Not so here.  Sorry.  I just did not find anything to my liking. 

 I hate food you have to question.  When I look at something I feel more comfortable when I can identify what it is.  But when you look at something and go \"what the heck is that?? I have never seen anything like that before\" then I hesitate.  Nope!  Not going in my mouth!!

Even the most common dishes were questionable.  The fried rice was sticky, the lo mein was sticky, the egg rolls were soggy.  I just can't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I eat at a lot of buffets and this place is pretty good. The food always tastes fresh and doesn't look like it's been sitting out for a long time and the sushi is good. I haven't tried their hibachi but everything else has been a hit!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie... I found a cooked wasp in my food, not sure which dish in particular, but that will end my patronage for a while. They were very apologetic and offered me a refill on my drink, but I was already half way out the door by then. Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"Ok, so the bar hasn't been set very high for all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets in Chambana but this is absolutely the worst Chinese buffet I've ever been to! Just about every item in their small buffet was gross, and even worse, I left the place wondering if I'm going to get sick in the near future... Not a good feeling when eating at a restaurant. I left feeling cheated out of my hard-earned money, not a mistake I'm likely to repeat again!"}
{"text":"Very good! I have been here several times and the selection and quality is great. They have sushi, a stir fry section, and a wide assortment of chinese foods. I especially enjoy the pepper chicken and the sushi. Also, it is only about $10 for dinner and $7-8 for lunch, which is a great price. There's also a $1 student discount if you show them your iCard. This is probably my go-to place when going out to eat."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice services. Good deal for  students. We always book this one for our community program. They try to give us good deal all the time."}
{"text":"I thought it was awesome. Went for dinner and had huge variety of shrimp and other seafood. Sushi was great too. Loved the food and the monstrous variety! Going tonight!"}
{"text":"UPDATE--(Again) Ichiban's quality has definitely been a roller coaster of ups and downs recently. I see that they really take food safety much more seriously after the health inspection scandal in May. The past few times I visited I did not see any unknown items in my food, which was commonplace before the inspection. The food was very fresh the last time I went, probably because of the large amount of people there. The staff told me that there are sometimes a lot of people but also very few on some days. I was impressed by the improved quality of the lo mein noodles. 

To boost business they made some new coupons on their website. You can print as many as you want, and there is no listed expiration date although they might stop accepting them and take them off the website. ichibanchampaign.com/coupon-offerings/2698646 There is a new to go \"lunch special\" for $4.50. You can find the lunch special menu here http://bit.ly/IchibanLS They are also running various other promotions to try to get their reputation up where it was. If you look for them you can find flyers around the restaurant with promotions like free beverage for sharing a photo of the flyer on social media, etc. 

There are not many real complaints considering the cheap price, you can read my previous reviews if you want to see the little nit picking complaints I have about Ichiban. Solid 4 star, one star off for using fake meat in dumplings(see my picture) and the scandal back in May. They have definitely earned (most of) their reputation back now."}
{"text":"Look, some of these other reviewers were writing as if they had just descended onto Tokyo's south side, and are bothered by the lack of 'authentic' Japanese cuisine... Forget them...

A few things to look for in a buffet are how hot and fresh is the food?  Check.
How speedy are the items refreshed on the line?  Check.
How quickly does the server refill your drink and clear your used plates?  Check and Check.

The food was good.  It wasn't great, but it was good.  A refreshing change in style from Chinatown Buffet, and the remodel looks fantastic!  The fresh sushi was actually better than I thought it would be, and the guys rolling it are totally willing to make a roll just the way you like it - as long as you are totally willing to toss a few bucks in the tip jar.  And do so, too!

The soups were hot, if not a little on the bland side, and a previous reviewer's comments about General Tso's chicken being a little bland is accurate, in fact it's almost as if all the spiciness was reduced from the food, which while it makes my taste buds sad, it makes my heartburn less!  

I've never been impressed with the very light dessert offerings at an oriental buffet, and it's clear they all order their chintzy cookies and cut sheet cakes from the same place, nothing great there.  However, they DID have Wisconsin's Premier Ice Cream - Schoep's in little cups in the freezer case, and that alone makes it worth the trip for me!  

So, if you want good food, hot, and plenty of it, with a reasonable assortment of decent sushi (really, how awesome do you expect buffet sushi to be?), and good, friendly service, Ichiban's is a great place to check out!

We'll be back, if only because it's closer to home than our old standby - Chinatown Buffet."}
{"text":"I love service here! The atmosphere is very nice it is well decorated and a lot of delicious food!! If you like buffets I would suggest going here it is great!!"}
{"text":"I eat there all the time I like their lunch, and I like their dinner,
 they have a good selection of seafoods and some foods you can't find anywhere else.
 I like their hibachi grill .
the price is fair and the service is very nice I'll keep going back"}
{"text":"Probably the worst buffet I've ever been to. I went for sushi and it was just awful. It looked funky and the rice seemed old. Nothing like the pictures I've seen here on yelp. What's worse is that you don't really know what you're eating. They didn't label any of the rolls, and you really can't tell what some of it is. It was edible but I expected to get sick the day after. 

As for the rest of their entree.. Everything pretty much tasted the same. Some were too salty and others were not so appetizing. Definitely not worth what we paid for."}
{"text":"This is, as others have said, really a Chinese Buffet with a Sushi bar. It is very clean, and has \"real\" sushi, not just an assortment of rolls.  The other selections are modest, but the real criticism is that everything is so bland even the \"flat top grill\" station when you ask the chef to put every sauce on the items."}
{"text":"Chinese is one of my favorites so I've been excited about Ichiban opening its doors last Friday.  It was evident that a lot of work was done to remodel the decor but the bottom line is the food.

In that aspect, I wasn't impressed.  I've gone twice now and neither time was as good as I had hoped.

The General Tso's Chicken was well below what I was expecting, and after trying other entrees, I would rate this as restaurant as below expectations.

If you are looking for good Chinese food, there are plenty of other restaurants in Champaign that are better."}
{"text":"The quality of this place has gone way down. If you're looking for a buffet for same price, definitely go to Chinatown buffet!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. The hostess who seated us noticed the dirty, used, unfolded napkin on the floor in front of our booth but didn't pick it up. The waitress who stopped at the table looked at the napkin too, but didn't pick it up.  The waiter at the next table stared at the napkin but didn't pick it up.

We decided we didn't want to spend our money here. When we left (45 seconds after being seated) I said to the hostess, \"We're not staying, do you want to  know why? Because three people--including you--saw a dirty napkin on the floor and didn't pick it up.\"  She started to say, \"The person whose responsibility that is... \" but I stopped her and said, \"It was your responsibility. It's everyone's responsibility.\"

If you don't have enough pride to keep the front of your restaurant clean, what do you suppose the kitchen looks like?"}
{"text":"Stopped in Sunday for a try even though I'm not a fan of Chinese buffets and was not greatly impressed. This location has the standard Chinese buffet fare, nothing special, the fried chicken, my personal favorite, was dismal, to say the least. The only reason I gave it two stars was due to the efficient and courteous staff I encountered."}
{"text":"The buffet is a great value and has many choices. Everything I tried was cooked right and had good flavor for buffet style food. 
I started with sushi and it tasted rather fresh and kept at a decent temperature. I wish they would label the sushi bar items better though. The sushi is separated cooked/uncooked, but that's it. I'd like to know exactly what kind of rolls I'm eating. They also need to have more serving utensils on the sushi bar. I give them a big plus for having shrimp sauce on the buffet, along with all the other sushi extras. 
All of the chicken and pork I had was tender, juicy, and flavorful. I know I will be eating here many times in the future if they keep the good food coming!m"}
{"text":"I would rather eat spam than ever walk back into this establishment. To emphasize how bad the experience was I am a vegetarian and I'd rather eat spam. I stood there waiting to get sat for over 15 mins, once seated I was greeted by my waitress whom was rude & barely knew English. I proceeded to the buffet the food LOOK amazing but looks fooled me. Once I sat down I realized that the food was cold & hard. I sat in my seat picking at my food around my plate. The assistant manager must've noticed and walked over asking me what was wrong I didn't want to make a big deal about it because I didn't want to draw any attention but he walked away and minutes came back with a lady whom I will assume was the manager. She walked over with an attitude and accused me of not wanting to pay as though I didn't have $ or something. I felt so degraded I didn't want to argue so I paid even after I paid she had an attitude and told me that she'd take $1.00 off of food that I didn't even intake as though she was doing me a favor. While taking my payment her and the assistant manager spoke in their native language arguing back and forth. I believe the assistant manager was arguing on my behalf. Nevertheless I would never ever go back to that establishment ever again even if someone tried to drag me in there!!!"}
{"text":"They got three stars just because they are like all the others. Meaning they are ok at best. Food mostly warm not hot. Selection is good but again just like all the others. Weekends are better but of course a little more $$. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Disgusting! This place is a cesspool and needs to be shutdown. I can't believe that the health department is doing their job if the this rat hole is allowed to operate. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST"}
{"text":"Ichiban Buffet serves overall perfectly fine (if very typical  food, has a large-ish selection of pretty good sushi, and  seems clean and organized on the inside. Prices are average for the type of place it is. There are no complex tastes or rich ambiance to blow your mind, but you weren't expecting that, were you? It's on par with another buffet on the north side of town, but placed where it is it fulfills a niche that has been missing recently."}
{"text":"Like a textbook takeoff and you forgot to bring enough fuel to cross the pond. 

$6.99 all you can eat. That's a good deal. The food is hot and fresh, albeit overly sweet and Americanized. But that's what you expect from a strip mall buffet.

I was impressed by the cook-to-order tappan table line. That might have been good.

But they just about lost me in other places. For all the good they've done (remodeling, competitive price, hot, fresh food), you get no ice in your water, no knives on your table, and when you leave you feel the same way you did when you walked out the county fair. Just too much sugar and oil.

There's a reason the help doesn't look anything like the customers. They don't eat this shit."}
{"text":"I have come to the conclusion that Chinese buffets are either horrible or extremely horrible.  This one is just regular horrible."}

{"text":"(Was a) nice little sushi bar and buffet selection for the price.  Nothing fantastic but I feel it's nicer than Chinatown. My family eats here 5-6 times a year.  Staff is always friendly, really no complaints.

My husband had black stuff his drink. My cup was dirty. Service was null and void. To top it all off, a giant roach was running from the building as we left. Also noticed they had an A rating but the restaurant score was just a 90. One point from getting a B and i see why. Will not be back. Sorry.."}
{"text":"I'm an Illinois native. I grew up in Missouri and lived close to Springfield, MO which is the cashew chicken capital of the United States basically. With that being said Springfield also has some great Chinese food eateries. I thoroughly enjoy a good Chinese Buffet so I was hoping for the best. They only had the pancake batter type of chicken and not the nice crispy nreading that usually also on a buffet. Lacked cashew chicken which was surprising. The food was decently fresh but they didn't have a lot of main dish items suited to my liking. They did have some seafood options if you like the way Chinese seafood is prepared. They also had some fresh sliced meats on the buffet. Those were better than I expected to find at a Chinese place. The desserts were bland but what can you expect from store bought desserts. The sugar cookie and vanilla ice cream were a nice option though. Staff was friendly and the place looked clean. Went for dinner on a Monday night. The buffet price was $10.99. Not bad considering all the items they have on the buffet."}
{"text":"The restaurant seems fairly clean inside, although they missed some details when they \"remodeled\" before opening.  This is an inexpensive, expansive buffet.  They also offer sushi and an hibachi grill.  The for is about 90% processed, frozen foods, as are most buffets.  Unfortunately, the quality of what they serve is in the economy class.  Most everything is over salted and over cooked.  The sushi is made with low grade seafood, you can certainly tell by the smell and the unpleasant tastes.  The hibachi grill would be tolerable is they didn't drown everything in soy sauce.  This is a good of the same quality and taste style as McDonald's or Burger King.  It's cheap, easy, processed foods, with a few veggies thrown in, sold in vast quantity at very low prices.  Their service staff also misses the mark frequently, with tea and water glasses often going empty.  They also greatly grown upon you not cleaning your plate before getting another, even if what you have on your plate is not palatable.  Not my go to place, but they are nearby and fat and cheap."}
{"text":"This location has never been particularly friendly to restaurants - from the original steakhouse (Quincy's, maybe?) to the Jamaican place that replaced it (Pop-a-Top?) to the first Chinese buffet that replaced it, to what was perhaps the longest running business, The Green Tomato Buffet, none seem to have fared all that well. Maybe the problem is that they have all had a buffet of sorts. Regardless, someone else has decided to give it a go, and this time they at least may have a bit of experience.

I say may because I really don't know for sure, but there is an Ichiban over near the airport, and certain aspects of this location remind me of that one - some fresher ingredients on the hibachi, including the ability to get an egg mixed in, some more creative sushi rolls, even frog legs on the buffet. No guarantees, but it's possible.

As to the food, for the most part it's a buffet. Generally the food is less fresh than you will get than if you order off of a menu, but for a buffet, it's pretty decent - especially the sushi and hibachi options. Buffet food is generally about average. I can say that I ate it and I didn't die, so that's a win."}
{"text":"love it! my fav crawfish & crab legs & of course the sushi."}

Esp like their little cup of ice cream.
Owner lady is super nice.
Can't ask for more for 6.99"}
{"text":"Yes. It's a buffet and the food is average. Yes, they also have a sushi bar but it isn't that great."}
{"text":"Ichiban delivers what you would expect from an all you can eat Asian buffet restaurant. I found no unpleasant surprises and everything was typical fare. 

I really enjoy several items on their bars though. Especially the crab rangoon and baked crab with cheese. 

As I said before, this place is what you would expect from a buffet place, so don't go in expecting anything more or anything less. So if you're a fan of these types of restaurants, you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"This place was supposed to be a Japanese Buffet! In fact it was billed on a sign as a \"Japanese Buffet\"

I had visions of trays of yakitori, udon, soba, hayashi, etc etc. but all the hot dishes are americanized Chinese dishes. 

The only thing Japanese about this place is the Sushi, but you can actually get better sushi next door in the seafood section of Schnucks. 

Nice people, the price is certainly right. I don't see this place lasting any longer than the place the was there before it. I would be happy to eat my words though."}
{"text":"The place was clean to start with so that is always a good sign. The bathroom is also clean. 
The service was very good, they really paid attention to us and ask if we needed anything. They also took the plates very quickly, so the table doesn't fill up.
The food all in all is good. I loved the frog legs, sushi, and so much more. Really nice place and a good price for a buffet"}
{"text":"Big thumbs up.

Went there for lunch. This is an expansive buffet - and everything was good. I really love the chicken on a stick. I could just make a meal of that. The sesame chicken, spring rolls and dumplings were also good. 

Unlike other comments, I think the new owners spruced up the place from the last restaurant. I'll admit - this is no palace. But inside was clean with new carpet and new paint.

Expect a little noise, maybe a kid or two. That comes with a big buffet place like this. But the service was nice and the food was very good. Let's face it - a $6.99 buffet is hard to beat. Especially with so much to offer. They also have sushi (didn't try) and some American items, which just seems out of place - but I know other Chinese buffets do it, too.

Bottom line: If you are really hungry -- go here."}
{"text":"Restaurant review:
In Chamabana, you donj't have a lot of options for buffet so I was hoping that this would be a solid 3-4 star experience, but alas due to rising food cost it just does not meet those expectations. I would say a couple of positive things is that the servers are friendly and there is ample parking. For the price of 6.99 for lunch I am not complaining, but if you want good food then this is not the best choice. The sushi station is well stocked, but for lunch you won't see any slices of salmon and many of the sushi contain odd components that I have never seen on sushi before. There was a thinly slice white fish nigri, shrimp, and a bunch of other sushi I can't describe what they are made of. At least the size of the sushi pieces was good, not too much rice. The stir-fry station is a stir fry station, it is the only place to get actual red meat at least during lunch time; although the cut of the meat was rough for stir fry. On to the hot food station. You are very limited by choices, lots of variety of chicken dishes from general tsao chicken, sweet and sour chicken, honey chicken, etc. There are dumplings, pork egg roll, crab rangoon, fries, cheese pizza, green beans, and 4 types of soup. There was stir fried clams which were good, but it made me nervous because you can get sick if these are not fresh or prepared well. Lots of random carb items like diced potato, fries, etc. Finally there was two types of fish, tilapia and some other unknown variety. You can end your meal with ice cream in a cup and many different standard chinese buffet pastries. Also a small salad bar with fruit is in the back. For the price you can't complain, but I found myself trying to find things that I would like to eat with no avail. I have not made up my mind whether I want to pay the mark up of 10.99 on Sunday or dinner buffet. There maybe crab legs is what I read on the sign.

Pro: AYCE buffet, friendly servers

Cons: limited food options, sushi is ? quality, no red meat entrees except for the meat on the stir fry station

Hidden gem:
At least there is no line and the sushi section is always stocked. Kids free under 3. Lunch price 6.99 and dinner price 10.99"}
{"text":"Meh. 
There was a lot of sushi, but I don't know what kind of fish it was made out of. 
The steam table food was kind of cold. 
I'd still eat there again though, because I'm poor-ish and I like sushi."}
