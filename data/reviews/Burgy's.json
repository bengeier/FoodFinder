{"text":"I should start this by saying, that over the past year and a half I've been here quite a few times and that about 4 months ago they switched over management and since then have only been here once and won't go back.  First thing they did when they changed hands is cut the portion size. The second thing they did was lower the quality but tons and raise the prices. I ordered the double burger with grilled pastrami and my friend ordered the basic goldburgey (1 patty with regular toppings).  The guys behind the counter are way too chatty for their own good. We watched them make our burgers and then leave it on the grill sitting while they chatted with another customer. Giving them the benefit of the doubt I figured maybe it wasn't our burgers that were sitting there, maybe it was someone else's who wanted it well-done. Finally I spoke up to see if our order number was ready (25 minute wait instead of the 10 they promised) and he said, \"Don't worry ma'am I have it under control), then turns around to grab the burgers and put them on the bun and hands them to me. So yes it was our 'overdone' burgers.  The burger was extremely dry and the bun insanely soggy. That was strike one. Then my friend tried mine and was like, did they forget your pastrami? She couldn't taste it so we looked inside and i was appalled to see that the pastrami was sliced so thin you could barely taste it, what a waste of the extra charge. Not too mention that the french fry serving was cut down by 1/3.  As well- they have a \"double screen\" section where as they are typing in your order at the counter you can see it, and I was next in line, while they were taking a phone order, you could see everything the person was ordering over the phone, the worst part was, that then they typed in the full name of the person and phone number and I knew them! So clearly there is no privacy.  To sum it up, awful tasting burgers, high raised prices, very horrible service and un-experienced boys behind the counter. Don't go there, not even for takeout."}
{"text":"Paid $30 for a burger and a grilled chicken. Then waited 40minutes for them to cook it. Worst of all the chicken was undercooked and the burger was overcooked.  Waste of time, money, and food. At least the rats will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Finally, a kosher burger/fastfood place in Thornhill. I would say this is the kosher answer to Harvey's and Wendy's. Places like this make keeping kosher very easy for people just starting a kosher lifestyle.  My experience at Burgy's was wonderful and better than expected.  Burgy's is COR Glatt Kosher. Most of the food is made right at the store! The only exception are the $3.49 burgers which are cooked from frozen and are Shefa brand.   Most topping are FREE and the selection is amazing. You can have onions, peppers, pickles,mushrooms, veggies, etc.  The shoe-string fries are amazing, just enough salt and not dripping in grease. The sweet potato fries also sounded good.   I was impressed with the variety on the menu. All day breakfast, at least ten different kinds of bugers (mushroom, egg, homemade veggie). They offer salads, hot dogs and chicken, too.   They have a slush machine, but it was not working when I visited.   All buns are white and thick. I was hoping for a whole wheat option.   There are two seating areas.  The prices are very affordable and I am looking forward to going there again!"}
{"text":"I love Goooold, Goldmember said.  No, you won't find Gold Members here. Kosher Burger Joint if you don't like the Food at least you'll get a laugh. The son was working the register asking a million questions as usual. Combo? Toppings? Sauces?  He didn't hesitate one bit, whatever I want. It was a pretty extensive selection of Toppings/Sauces, score! We ended up having a laugh at his comment as we headed out.   :D  Goldburger Combo($6.99 burger/$3.00 fries/drink)  Bun was as if someone drew it and made it come to life a la Roger Rabbit. Perfect roundness circumference unmangled and has sustenance.  The 100% Beef Patty did have basic seasoning(salt/pepper), nice. I liked the way it was cooked still had juiciness when you compress it.  My bad on the shoestring Yam Fries which were seasoned. Not as crisp as hoped for and slight burnt.  Just Burger me, yeah? I'm not a Fries person anyways.  GRANDMA Hot Pepper(Topping) had nice blister appearance and heat. Cimmi Churri Sauce wasn't spread thoroughly and didn't taste it."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disgusted. If I could have given this review 0 stars I would have.   Although I had eaten takeout from there once before and was not impressed, I thought I would give the dine-in experience a shot. Again, not good.   Let's go through the order process, the customer is very rushed and then brushed aside. Personally, it may not be a fine dining experience, it is a burger joint after all, but one should not feel like they are going through a drive through without a car.  The choices of toppings are vast and fresh but in reality, once it gets on the burger it's no longer so impressive. Paper thin (1 mm) slices of tomato,  a teaspoon of shredded iceberg lettuce, etc.   As I mentioned, I had eaten from there once before by takeout. That experience was horrid. A sloppy burger with an un-toasted bun. By the time it arrived the bun was mushy due to the wetness of the toppings both above and below the burger. The burger itself  was more of a rock hard, dried up oval meatball.  In order to avoid another squishy, greasy disaster I asked them if I could explain to the guy how I wanted the burger made. This request was blown up, among the staff behind the burger bar, into loud, embarrassing, epic proportions.  A simple request turned so wrong I honestly thought I was dreaming it. If not for my husband and two kids I would have walked right out the door. In hindsight, I should have.  When they called my number I asked them to make sure that my son's bun was not burnt (as I saw several coming off the grill charred) and I was told that since it was now busy in the restaurant they do not toast the buns. That is only a request they are willing to accommodate during non-busy periods of the day.  Then, the \"burger builder\", who was the only seemingly polite staff member there this evening, asked me exactly how I wanted the burger constructed. All the while I can actually hear the back staff making fun of the request and again making it into an offence rather than a request. Then, when someone finally noticed that they may have been a bit rude, they sent someone to give a halfhearted apology repeating over and over again how \"G-d forbid we would ever want to embarrass anyone!\" By the way, the grandiose apology was more of a spectacle than the original scene and preformed at double the original volume as well.  I guess the topping on the burger, so to speak, was the fact that there was a nice short black hair stuck to the red gingham picnic paper that lined the Styrofoam container. When this was pointed out the order taker (also the ignitor of the original scene and the Oscar winning apologizer) acted as if he did not see it. He then became  very loud and belligerent as he shouted \"goodbye, goodbye, goodbye\" as I was leaving.  Well, to them, I say \"goodbye, goodbye, goodbye\". They will never see me again. I have posted the picture I took of the hair in the basket of fries. I also want to see how they laugh when the board of health comes in to investigate why no one wears a hat and/or a hairnet and why one handles both food and money without washing their hands.  I really wish the kosher community of the GTA would raise their standards already. We no longer live in a little steitle. We all work hard and when we go out with our families for a meal, whether it is fast food or fine dining, we should expect more; both of the food and the customer service we receive."}
{"text":"Awful. Rude employees, I will never eat here again. I went one night with my husband, and they now have this new complicated computer system to choose toppings. I accidentally interrupted and the 20 something year old guy working there bit my head off. then when we asked him to ring us up together he didn't want to comply  and instead made a rude and obnoxious comment to me, saying don't worry, I'm sure he will pay for your meal too. Then he slammed down my debit card hard on the counter.  The food was disgusting. cold and mushy and condiments sloppily put on the sandwich. the grilled chicken sandwiches are skimpy, the fries are cold and mushy. with rude employees and mediocre food, I think I will give this a pass."}
{"text":"Burgy's Goldburger is brand new and does not disappoint. The burger was delicious and the sweet potato fries were finger licking good.   I only want a burger maybe one or two times per year, and I am usually disappointed when I try to fill that craving here in Toronto. The menu of kosher meat in Toronto is pretty lackluster if you're not a fan of the gross \"We're Cheap and Kosher!\" slap 'em together burger imitation available elsewhere in the city. For that matter, the more expensive kosher burgers are equally lackluster in taste. Blah.   Bottom line is that this is the best burger I have tasted in Toronto. Go. Eat. You'll like it."}
{"text":"Don't ask for a cheeseburger. \"Chris\" and I hit this place up before seeing a $2 Tuesday movie (although it's not). It was more like $12 Tuesday because the only way to see movies these days is in 3D that's not used and ETX which adds $5 to the price of a movie. Anyway, I ramble. The point is, it was bonding time. \"Chris\" and I wanted to have burgers, fries, and watch decapitations.   After seeing a flurry of Yelp reviews I wanted to see if this place out Five Guys Five Guys.   But like I say, don't ask for a cheeseburger. It ain't kosher here. And I don't use that as a metaphor. This is a kosher burger joint. It took me a bit to remember you don't mix dairy and meat in kosher cuisine. Doh. And don't expect a bacon burger either. But that's okay. As Michael Goudeau astutely notes, if you have to add bacon to a dish, you're really ultimately apologizing that its flavor wasn't good enough and can only be rescued by the addition of bacon.  If you order the basic double burger you're encouraged to order the cutely named Big Moish. (The Urban Dictionary tells me moish is slang for \"gay\". So put a big gay hunk of meat in your mouth. First time I did that sober.) The normal burger uses frozen patties, the Big Moish uses the hand packed meat. I wanted to compare their top of the line burger to Five Guys so I opted for the more expensive Big Moish. You get a range of topping choices. Careful. Some are at additional charge.   The burger, I'd say, falls a bit short of Five Guys. But the shoestring fries rock. I wonder if you could just smuggle in your own slice of processed cheese and throw it on when no one is looking?    This place does brisk business during the dinner hour. Who eats out Tuesday? Lots around Steeles/Bathurst. There's a healthy line. A good sign for an indie burger joint.  The all day breakfast specials appear to be decent deals for Toronto, though I'm not sure about portion size. I'd come here no probs to try their breakfast.  Friendly service, lots of seating. It's in the same plaza as Freshco. It's on the west side of the building block that has the Ma Va Me.  Price wise, it compares well to Five Guys. Although I think $15 at Five Guys will only get you the burger and fries. No coke. Not even pepsi."}
{"text":"I understand that this is a Kosher place and I have experienced numerous Kosher restaurants (like Joe Boo's chicken, which is not too far from Burgy's) I know we went right during the first week or two of opening so I understand that it was hectic and not all the kinks were smoothed out (part of the reason  i am giving it 2 stars) We wanted to eat in and the restaurant is so small and was PACKED inside On one of the tables there was an older gentleman setting up a computer system, which took up the entire front almost We had to wait quite awhile The ordering system seemed so unorganized and they were putting on one burger at a time.. when a place is busy, there should be as many burgers as can fit on the grill going so that people don't have to wait as long The toppings were impressive (the main reason for a few stars) The offer grilled eggplant, hot peppers, tons of sauces, and all the traditional toppings too When we had the burgers, the buns were not right They were definitely not burger buns and were too think and not airy, not fluffy, not grilled, not cut evenly and completely too much bread for the burger The burger also had no flavour ... maybe they add seasoning now but it was SO bland when I tried it.. lacking salt, pepper...anything to enhance it The burger is thick and with the toppings, it can be quite a mouthful  There are a lot of sauces but some were too watery and not too flavourful The fries were also really bad.. WAY too soggy and tasteless (I had the sweet potato fries) Overall, no one in my group of 4 was impressed and we don't plan to return  Joo Boo Cookoo's has a burger special now actually (also a Kosher place) .. that's the next burger i'm going to try Hopefully it fares better than burgy's"}
{"text":"A glatt kosher burger place in Thornhill? Yes, please.  The welcome was warm, a couple of counter kids made bitter from months of working together over a hot grill and dealing with a mixed clientele showed an interesting sense of humour that certainly wouldn't quite be welcomed by all diners. It certainly set a tone and loudness level for the place.  The basic burger is the same as one buys in the deep freeze at any of the local supermarches, but start with the \"Goldburger\", and we're talking hand-made ground beef burger likely made with identifiable ingredients and absolutely juicy off the grill. Thoroughly customizable with pictures of condiments shown on a computer screen at the cash (with prices of some where they charge), this is quite some burger experience.  Even without the addition of grilled mushrooms and onions to my burger, I'm certain that the bun would have soaked through, making life difficult for the amateur burger consumer (flip the entire thing over when eating). With the $3 addition of a side (shoestring fries- recommended, over-salted sweet potato fries, daily soup...) and a beverage, the fast-food meal comes out to over $10 easily.  Food tasty, if not the cleanest place on earth, but that helps with the charm, service not for everyone, but certainly a fun neighbourhood joint for good burger. Recommended."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about another Kosher place in Thornhill. The current restaurant owners in the area don't seem to be getting things right which is why there is such a turn over in that market.  Either way I was craving a burger and a friend of mine and I decided to check the place out.  I was pleasantly surprised with the variety on the menu and the friendliness of the service there. Burgie's has got some key things right but at the same thing the restaurant is in it's early days and still needs to work out a few kinks.   I ordered the Eggy burger (Which was amazing) and the fries which were also some of the best I've had in a very long time.   I was fully by the end of the meal without breaking the bank. Definitely worth a shot looking into if you are in the mood for burgers.  Most likely going to check out the All Day Breakfast Menu next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Burgy's Goldburger Burger Bar can be a mouthful! Just don't ask me to say that 10 times quickly!  Kosher burger? A little taken back by that $6.99 for a basic burger... but is nothing too basic and can get a little complicated when you start ordering!  You would be asked the following questions and have to answer without thinking!!  What Toppings? What Sauce? Combo or not? What Side? What Drink?  Too many choices were popping up on the screen in front of you!   I am glad I was not the one that had to make all the decisions! Maybe should just say everything?  How's a kosher burger tasted like? taste like a burger! So it is a plus if you can only eat kosher food!  Next door of Burgy's Goldburger Burger Bar is a Kosher Chinese Takeout place! Kosher Chinese?? I wondering what's the difference!"}
{"text":"Burgers are made fresh if you pay the additional price, service is not very friendly and I felt rushed.  The burger seem very mushy and sloppy looking when put together, I honestly would just go to a Burger King or Harvey's for a burger."}
