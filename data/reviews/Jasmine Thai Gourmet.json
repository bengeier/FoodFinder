{"text":"I've had take out from Jasmine about four or five times now, tried something different each time, and everything has been delicious. My husband has always been the one to pick up the food and says that each time he goes in they give him something more to snack on while he waits for the order. They always seem very friendly, too.  The price is nice and cheap depending on what you order. My ONLY complaint about Jasmine is that they need more items on their menu. A place this good needs more variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Update:  CLOSED!  What a shame!  I called to have an order delivered (in the SW) and the phone was answered in another location, possibly the NW part of town.  Unfortunately, too far for delivery.   Original Review....  Outstanding!  I have eaten in the restaurant and have also ordered delivery.  Both meals were exceptional.  Excellent service!  Restaurant is very comfortable - nice ambience.  Quiet but not too quiet, nice lighting - not too dark and not too bright.  I loved all the food I have ordered at Jasmine That Gourmet and so did my husband.  Most notable in my opinion were the chicken satay appetizer, crab rangoon, and mongolian beef entree.  My husband said the hot-n-sour soup was fabulous and finished every drop.  I did not care for the egg rolls.  They were more like deep fried flautas filled with beef - not what I was expecting.  Everything else - and we ordered A LOT, was outstanding.  Excellent sauces, dressings, and rices.    Huge selection!  The menu is a book!  Very reasonable prices!  This place, like another yelper stated, is fine to go alone, or with company.  I would also suggest this place for a good \"on the road office\" spot, while you grab a bite, as it seems to have an environment one could work in easily.  I will defintely be a regular at Jasmine Thai Gourmet now that I have finally discovered this little gem!  Thanks yelpers - you recommended a real good one!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times over the last year.  This place has really great lunch specials and prices.  I've had the pad thai, pad siew and red curry  chicken.  All were really good.  The service is really fast too.  The crab rangoon that came with lunch is good and the salad has a really tasty dressing. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We do take-out every couple of weeks. I love this place - it's good and reasonably priced. My husband gets the red spicy curry and I get the yellow mild curry. We've also eaten in the restaurant with my in-laws and they really enjoyed too. The people are friendly. It's never been super busy when we've gone, so it might be quiet in the restaurant. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably good - Thai food is my favorite, and I've sampled many places searching for the perfect flavor for  pad Thai - found it here."}
{"text":"I went there with hesitation due to the reviews of others, I'm glad I listened to my husband and not those who are never happy about anything, those who just like to always complain, and those who shouldn't go out to eat!!!!!!! This restaurant has absolutely DELICIOUS food! We ordered tofu pad thai, red curry, broccoli and beef, and chicken w/mushrooms. Which by way the mushrooms were huge and fresh! This is a small restaurant, 5 tables maybe, most of the \"guests\" coming in were there for to go orders. The restaurant is doing something right even if most of the business is to go orders. Service? She was good! Refilled our beverages when it was low. The food came out when it was done cooking. If you want 5 diamond service then go to that restaurant, I'm sure the owner rather you go there then come back to their restaurant and nit pick anyways!     If anyone is a Andrew Zimmern fan, then you know where he goes to for fabulous food, you don't see him at a steak house, you see him in a hole in the wall restaurant.    So to those who like to nit pick everything, perhaps just negative. Keep it to yourself, let the rest of us enjoy the food at Jasmine tai Gourmet"}
{"text":"Everything I tasted here was great.  Had a shrimp curry and chicken lettuce wraps.  Was with a group of 5 and no one had a bad meal."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in town!! Never had a bad meal! My only complaint is that they advertise delivery, but only have a driver 50% of the time."}
{"text":"Another good Yelp find. Tired of the overpriced and blah food on the strip, we braved a car trip away from the lights. Yelp pointed us to this restaurant and it didn't disappoint! Spicy Catfish!!"}
{"text":"They used salad mushrooms in my Tom kar khai soup...couldn't move past that.  How cheap!  Chicken salad wraps are good.  The quality was better many moons ago.  It used to be local owned (husband and wife couple) and they really worked hard and I am happy to support them, but the food isn't as amazing as it used to be.  I wish I liked it more."}
{"text":"I used to live in the apartment complex next to Jasmine's, and frequently found myself enjoying their delicious food three or four times a month.  I was never disappointed by their menu, and enjoyed their delicious ginger dressing on their green salads.  The service was impeccable, and the prices were reasonable.  Good for a night with friends, a date, or just eating alone."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been here a couple of times. White tablecloths and a quiet, comfortable atmosphere--with jazz music playing in the background. They have an interesting menu, including Chinese and Thai food, and tasty appetizers. This is a nice place to sit down, relax, and enjoy.  We were well served and our food was delicious--both times. The house salad is simple but has a nice ginger dressing."}
{"text":"Jasmine Thai is by my girl friends house and when I visit her in Las Vegas, we inevitably end up here... our little, hard-to-find-ifyadontknowit Thai nook.  It's just a cute lil restaurant with average/good Thai cuisine and a friendly staff.  They serve their Pad Thai noodles a lil more sweet than I prefer but my friend and her daughter love it.    This last time I wasn't feeling well so I ordered their wonton soup and it was sooo good.  I would definitely order it again.  I'll post a picture of it so you can see the amazing chicken, shrimp, slices of pork, veggies and wontons that completely filled my small bowl!  The broth was so tasty too, just what my sensitive tummy needed.  See ya there!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this place and am thrilled to have such good Thai food so close. It is easily on par with Lotus of Siam, which has slipped a bit in my opinion. My favorite dishes are the tom yum soup, pineapple curry, the pork jerky appetizer, and of course the mango with sticky rice (assuming they have it). The only downside of this restaurant is it is pretty small but they mostly do take out so there is almost always enough room to sit down. I like these sites but I have to say the people that go to a place once and have a bad experience and write a scathing review make me mad. I have been here probably 20+ times and sure there have been a few small issues but overall the service is great and the food is very good."}
{"text":"I just love this place!  The yellow curry is out of this world and the spicy string beans with pork are some of the best I have ever tasted.  Just recently, on our way back from So Cal this week, my fiance and I both were thinking the same thing...we want Jasmine for diner tonight.  So, I called in our order just as we were coming into Vegas and when I walked into pick it up, I was instantly happy,everyonethere is always so friendly!"}
{"text":"Jasmine Thai is just OK Thai food in my opinion.  My girlfriend thinks it's a lot better than I do.  I hadn't had Jasmine in awhile, so I grabbed a GC off of restaurant.com and we went there for dinner tonight.  We had to spend $35, so we ordered 2 appetizers: the crab rangoon (awesome) and the chicken satays (disappointing).  I had the pad thai, which I didn't find as good as Thai Taste, where I usually go.  My girlfriend had the pad se eu, and I tried it and liked that a lot better than my dish.  We also had a large thai iced tea to get us up to $35.  Good meal, yeah, but I'd personally rather go elsewhere for Thai."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. But I have a really stringent standard by which I rate Thai food.   Whenever trying out a new Thai place, I always get a green papaya salad, sticky rice, and green curry with tofu and then judge from there. This is my control.   Jasmine was pretty good. I actually started out with the naked shrimp salad, a nice alternative to the green papaya. I liked that the shrimp were completely shelled. The lemongrass in this dish was prominent and fresh.   The green curry was alright. And the presentation of the sticky mango rice was adorable: shaped into a heart with the mango in a wreath around it.   My bf said the Thai tea was too sweet. But I like my Thai tea like I like my women: sweet and large.   Tonight was my first time here. They're open late + close to work = awesome.   I thought the portion size to price ratio was a little steep. For 50 bucks for two, I expect to walk away with enough leftovers to feed me the rest of the next day. And I did not.   The best part of this place was the ambiance and service. It was a tiny hole in the wall, having only five two-tops and one four-top (14 covers). And our server was this cute little Thai girl. I wanted to take her home.   And do naughty things to her.  * off the strip, non-casino"}
{"text":"This is a major disappointment.  All of the 5 star reviews have misled me again!  I was out on this side of town and decided to finally seek good Thai food in Southern Nevada.  I hate combo Thai-Chinese places (since when did the countries share a common cuisine?)  The lunch special banner outside said \"$6.95 Lunch Specials\" but in small print \"take-out only.\"  I ordered the spicy eggplant with basil special off the vegetarian menu.  I started with a salad (my friend and I called it \"sad\"), then got my dish - a very very small portion of eggplant and a few bell peppers, and rice, then one rangoon got delivered even though both my friend and I should have received one - and then they gave me pork wontons with my veggie meal...uh yuk!  The dish had ZERO spice in it.  I would think \"spicy eggplant\" would indicate something, but there was not a drop of heat - no red pepper flake, chili pepper, or chili oil.  It was not worth sending back because the portion was so small, by the time I tasted a piece of eggplant to test the flavor, there was hardly any left! Save your money and for a really good deal, go to Galanga.  I haven't reviewed it yet because I only went once, but you get tons of food for your money there.  I would not return."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times since it's so close to my house and I can say that the food is very inconsistent. The same dish can be  either delicious or a complete miss, which is very strange. They also seem to mess up my order quite often... How hard is it to skip eggs in a noodle dish when nicely asked not to put any? The place is very small and if you have food delivered to your house, it will take  forever. On the positive side, Most items can be made vegan and the staff is pretty nice.  I personally like Pin Kaow a little better."}
{"text":"This awesome place closed suddenly. The sign is off the building & the Justice Court has sealed the doors.....Too bad, very good Thai spot. I ordered from them often....."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant regularly for over 3 years.  I went there twice with a friend in October, 2009, and was disappointed on both occasions. The tom-kha-gai (coconut soup) had lost it's flavor and other meals tasted different also. I thought that maybe it was the regular chef's night-off since it was early-week. So, the next time I went at a busier time of week, I ordered the same dishes. And the same result, except this time I had a big black hair in my soup.  I used to love this place, but it's not what it was. It's not all bad however, it's still a very nice environment and the Green curry is still one of the best I have had in Las Vegas.. But for more authentic Thai cuisine you may want to try Basil n Lime on Forte Apache. It's more tasty and cheaper in price."}
