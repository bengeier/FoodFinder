{"text":"I gave Muldoon's yet another shot because a friend wanted to go there for lunch today.    Today I had an overcooked burger on a stale bun with soggy, oily fries and a surly waitress who could not care less about serving us.  The salad that my friend ordered was a pile of iceburg lettuce that was brown at the edges covered with an overcooked, dry chicken breast.

I used to love this place, but the quality of food, service, and cleanliness have all gone so far downhill that I will be taking my business elsewhere.

I am so glad better quality restaurants are opening in our neighborhood. I'd rather go to any other place in North Collinwood and spend my money in a place that cares about their customers than at Muldoon's."}
{"text":"Muldoon's is the kind of restaurant that the Winking lizard is trying to be. Pub fare, large beer selection and free popcorn. But the food is better and the staff is friendlier.

Thursdays are 2$ burgers, which are pretty good. The deal definitely fills up the place. The prices are reasonable other nights, too."}
{"text":"Looks small from the outside but very roomy inside. A little loud and busy the night I went there. Looks like it could use a little updating but the food and service were good."}
{"text":"Old school-style business lunch here was pretty darn good.    Reuben, while not STACKED, with corned beef was tasty, sloppy and enjoyable.   The real star of the show was the side of onion rings.  Man, as close to perfection as can be imagined.   Gotta imagine their fried fish is dunked in the same heavenly batter."}
{"text":"Great beer.

Great food.

Great service.

Great people.

They should change the name to WORLD FAMOUS MULDOONS because everywhere I go, people know the place.

If you have the chance, stop in and enjoy. We eat there often and have never had a bad meal. 

Not a bad item on the menu...and we've tried them all."}
{"text":"Quite interesting place. The owners walk around and greet you which is very welcoming. The Irish egg rolls are tasty and I recommend trying them. 

I ordered the meatloaf and I don't recommend it. It was bland and very dense. I'm used to my grandma's meatloaf which is juicy and full of flavor. The other food I saw around looked good."}
{"text":"The food and service quality here has been in steady decline. Most recently I got a chicken breast that was so poorly cooked that I had to saw through it with a serrated steak knife. The texture offset the blandness at least. This used to be one of my favorite places, eating there at least twice monthly but now I just avoid it."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time. On my last visit, I ordered take out. I arrive, go to the bar, give the bartender my name and tell her I have takeout. There is a box sitting by the register. 20 minutes later, she picks up the bag that has been there the whole time and tells me my order is ready. I tell her I do not want it since it has been sitting there as long as I have. She then tells me I can just have the food for free because it would just be thrown away!! Totally unacceptable. So disappointed, and shocked that she was to incompetent to even look at the bag that was right in front of her face."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. They have a good happy hour and the food isn't what I'd call \"good,\" but it hits the spot. I have heard amazing things about the fish and chips though. Service is always a little bit reserved, but still on the friendly side. Good for groups too. Also, randomly a good beer selection."}
{"text":"Muldoon's: casual, police, grub

Maui Chicken
Teriyaki glazed chicken breast over a bed of fresh salad greens, topped with pineapples, mandarin oranges, water chestnuts, almonds and served with our Oriental dressing.

Heath Happiness
Real Heath pieces placed on vanilla ice cream topped with whipped cream, and just the right amount of caramel."}
{"text":"I want to visit again before I judge either way, however, my short dinner visit here was pleasant. Decent steak special (not writing home to mom about it but decent), friendly staff, earthy warmth about it....almost divey but in a clean western/irish motif kinda way. Just comes across as a relaxing place to go and I'm willing to bet had I ordered something on-menu it might be a bit more impressive as I didn't see a soul there that seemed to be discouraged."}
{"text":"Went here twice this week. The first time had no issues,  was waited on promptly but waited longer than normal for food which I will attribute to such a large order. 

Yesterday was a totally different story. I sat an entire 45 minutes before we finally called the manager who took our orders. Two waitresses walked by our table repeatedly and proceeded to take the order of the table that came in after us before taking our orders. 

We ordered the stuffed mushrooms (which are usually to die for) but this time they were very cold by the time we received them. 

Will I go back again, yes but the service received yesterday was unacceptable. I will try one more time before I give up."}
{"text":"Relaxed neighborhood vaguely Irish style bar and grill atmosphere. The staff is very friendly, I was coughing and the lady at the register spontaneously pulled 3 cough drops out of her pocket for me. Mostly American food but they have some Vaguely Irish-American stuff (corned beef sandwich) and the Chicken Paprikash (Hungarian) is quite tasty. Full bar with an emphasis on Irish beverages, good place to watch a game, chill atmosphere. Great service."}
{"text":"I had a awful experience the last time I stopped here. The bartender was rude and seemed drunk. The patrons are mostly 60 and up. The menu was also HUGE, how can they expect quality food with so many items."}
{"text":"Had a nice time at this place, which looks much smaller than it actually is.
I have a salad and a drink, and found that the atmosphere was very homey, the service was good and the folks seemed nice. It's right off the highway and is one of those neighborhood watering holes that you hear of from a friend or acquaintance, but you can't fully appreciate until you go. 

One of the minor, off-putting elements is parking, mainly because there's never enough, but if you get there, get there early, because I guarantee that you you get your money's worth drink and food-wise. 

So, for a place where you  can hang with friends and enjoy a libation and a generous helping of tasty, try Muldoon's!"}
{"text":"very comfortable place to eat.  they work on the honor system here.  i think more places should start to do this"}
{"text":"We go here a lot for family gatherings. The kids love to load up the free popcorn into a basket and munch at the table while they color. Our group is usually 15+ and they always accommodate us. There is never a complaint in food. The potato soup is always a winter favorite of mine and I can't pass up the fish and chips. The bathrooms are always clean and I think that's a good sign. If it's lunch or dinner I would recommend stopping in and enjoying yourself."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  Nice atmosphere, food is great, what more can one ask for? Oh and dont forget to try the FREE popcorn, its EXCELLENT!  Try my favorite the Fish Taco's."}
{"text":"Ick. There's not much else to say. The food is garbage th service is... Weird... Our \"server\" was rude and impatient. I'm not expecting fine dining but typical manners doesn't seem like it would be too much to ask."}
{"text":"Decent. Good pub food. Very good beer selection for an off-the-highway pseudo hole-in-the-wall. Actually very exceptional given the area. Its kind of a walk in and sit yourself as you wave to the waitresses bustling around. 

The manager tends to come around and check on people when its busy which is nice. Great late night eats spot. Especially after climbing at the rock gym down the road."}
{"text":"A pretty standard American family bar with nice TVs and a good beer selection. I like how they have the option to buy the pint glass of the month from different microbreweries around the country. The wings are what you'd expect from a place where the bar area caters to sports fans. Most of the other food has been pretty average in my opinion, like the fries and sandwiches, but the chicken tenders did let me down twice with way too much overcooked breading. The service was always friendly and definitely a clean family  atmosphere."}
{"text":"What are you doing Thursday night? Pack up the mini-van: we're going to Muldoon's! 

Thursday is TWO DOLLAR BURGER NIGHT. That's right Two dollars (with beverage purchase). Muldoon's plays host to my group of friends each week, and the area's best waitress, Theresa, warms our hearts with her smile, top service and refreshing you're-nutty-people-but-I'll-still-treat-you-like-family manner. 

The burgers are fast and tasty. But it's not all ground beef at Muldoon's. The chili, pizza, gyro and tuna melt rank among my faves. The wings, which are on special several nights a week, have gotten top reviews. And I'm eager to hit Muldoon's on a Wednesday soon for the $2.49 pulled pork sandwich special.

Muldoon's offers a relaxed-yet-hopping atmosphere in a convenient location just off the highway and a short jog from lakefront neighborhoods on the near-eastside. As I mentioned: Theresa rocks! Some of the other wait staff can be a little grumpy, but Muldoon's gets a thumbs up for overall accommodation. It's kid-friendly and me-approved."}
{"text":"The wait staff is super friendly , all smiles.  Onion rings and beer battered fish are awesome.  Even the dinner salad was generous and well made. Great beer menu, great place for a reasonably priced dinner"}
{"text":"Wow we loved the Fish and Chips, place is really great. Good Prices, easy to park. Lots of choices."}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time by recommendation from a friend. Looked at their online menu so I had an idea of what I wanted. 

Ordered the pub soup. Absolutely no flavor. Very disappointing. Got 10 hot garlic parm wings. Not hot or spicy whatsoever. Again, no flavor. Finished with a Reuben, which was the best out of the three but that isn't saying much. 

Add to that when I asked for a side of mayo it came out in a plastic ramican (sp?) 

The food is way over priced for the quality. The service was ok. I sat at the bar, and she got my refills after I asked, but never asked me how anything was. Was very unfriendly and just looked like she hated life in general.

This is probably an OK place to go have a beer and watch the game, but I would look past the food. Not worth the $30 I spent (not including the tip)"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 for me, but I'm rounding down to a 3 since I've only been there once and had one dish. 

I read through all the reviews before stopping here for dinner with my sister, boyfriend and his son. Honestly, I was sold on the fresh grouper and Yelper Paulius N couldn't have been more correct--it was perfect. I don't know how they do it, but the lemon pepper grouper is perfectly cooked, fresh tasting and seasoned well. I'm sure it's drenched in butter, but it didn't look or taste like it was. All you could taste was how good it was. 

Instead of fries, I paired my grouper with a side salad that was very traditional for a pub, but sometimes you want an old school style salad. You know, lots of crunchy lettuce, croutons, cheese and a little side of ranch. They even give a bread stick, although it wasn't my favorite (.... it was sort of phallic to be honest, ha!) I also got a side of apple sauce, which my boyfriend's son gobbled down quickly. 

The only two things that I'd change would have to be: 
- The long, thorough up-and-down look you'll get from the cops eating there when you walk in
- The dirty carpet in the one room. I hate carpet (usually) in restaurants, although in certain cases it has it's place. 

Other than that, I'll be back just for the grouper alone."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and management, great food, daily specials, and a wide beer selection. This is the go-to restaurant in Euclid."}
{"text":"Food is solid, but not spectacular.  Pretty much classic pub grub.  Good beer selection, both draft and bottle."}
{"text":"WOW! The great service and excellent bar food never ceases to amaze me! These people really get it. It is like they are in a co-op  Super friendly and food is prepared how you want it, taking ownership for each persons experience! 

Man it is hard to find a place at this price point, in this part of the town, that consistently executes fantastic bar food, small town friendly service, good beer, no pretensions,  and good people.  I do not need another gastro pub, cause this place is what preceded gastro pubs! 

Fcuk Yo carry on!"}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff - even the busboy said hello.  Different specials each night of the week.  Tonight was $2 cheeseburgers and 40¢ wings.  Great value.  Inside was clean and atmosphere was fun. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"If I got hung up too much on intangibles, I could give Muldoon's 4 stars, and if there was a 3.5 option, I'd give the extra half star.

Outstanding beer selection and really really good pizza.  Used to go to Muldoon's about once a week with my wife, and after a couple of merely \"okay\" experiences, we stopped.  We've been back a couple of times recently and enjoyed ourselves.  Good basic pub grub and some very good specials.

The staff are extremely friendly and make you feel very at home."}
{"text":"A great low-key, casual spot.  

Free popcorn is a plus
Must try the salad wedge, w/ thousand island and bacon bits
Great wings
$5 burgers on Thursday nights."}
{"text":"A few months ago my family and I had a God-awful experience.  So bad the manager had to come over and apologize.  The past 2 weeks I have been there for wings and beers after work.  Tonight was the last straw.  I LITERALLY had to wait for EVERYTHING I needed.  Beer, to-go stuff, etc.  Shes too busy walking around and talking to tables and other servers behind the bar.  The final straw is when I hear another server drop the \"f\" bomb while talking to Miss Social Butterfly bartender.  Real pieces of work you have here.  Why should I have to wait almost 10 minutes for a beer when there is 7 people at the bar??  This isnt a college bar with kids working.  Were all adults here and Im tired of the nonchalant attitude with the servers towards PAYING customers.  Im super low maintinance. I have worked in bars for years and what I see sucks.  How they make money is beyond me...."}
{"text":"This place has the best French onion soup iv ever had!! Iv been here a bunch of times and the food is always good. Friendly atmosphere. Always the same happy staff. Fresh popcorn while u wait is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Muldoon's is a neighborhood pub and grill par excellance-- good food, and a superb selection of beer-- Irish beers on tap (Guinness, Harp, Smithwicks) with a bartender who knows how to do a blacksmith or a black and gold; and a large selection of bottled beers from around the world.  A full menu, the food is fine, and portions are generous.
It's a pretty big place, not a dive, and I've never seen it when it wasn't pretty full, but we've never had to wait for a table (except on nights that the Indians are playing-- it's not a \"sports bar' per se, but it does have televisions going on the sports channels.  Sound is off, fortunately.).  Despite being usually full of people, it's been quiet enough to talk, so I'm happy.
Right off the exit from I-90 westbound; slightly harder to get to from I-90 eastbound."}
{"text":"most amazing crispy garlic parm wings in the universe!!! everything they serve is wonderful and the staff stays the same so you know you always get great service every time. we drive half hour to get here! love it!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little pub style place to catch a quick bite or hang out for the game. They have a good crowd of regulars and are a popular stop for dinner most evenings. Friendly neighborhood type service, full bar and pub/bar style fare. Lots of weekly specials. Shepherd's Pie, steaks and burgers, grouper, soups and salads. Nice beer list. On weekends there is a line waiting for a table or a spot at the bar all the time. Great selection of appetizers or desserts as well in case you are looking for somewhere to begin or end your evening. Full parking lot and conveniently right off I90."}
{"text":"A decent local place.My visit and food was fine. My peers... not so much. I've heard raw chicken and food poisoning stories about this place. Lucky for them, I don't eat chicken so I can't comment firsthand. 

The menu was stuffed, yet nothing stood out as a special item. It's just a place to go if you're not expecting much pleasure from a meal. They serve sustenance.

p.s. The cajun chicken was just a basic breast with a sprinkle of seasoning. Corned beef tasted like it was from an expensive can. The black bean burger was as good as buying from Costco."}
{"text":"Solid pub fare.  Yesterday I had the best (special) Florida grouper I can recall, with the option of having it prepared 4 different ways.  There were 3 of us, so we tried it 3 of the 4 ways.  All were very delicious.  All in all, I have been here many times over the years and a, never dissapointed.  Also, one of the last places in town to use the \"honor system\" during lunch.  You go up to the bar, tell them what you had, pay and go.  Nice!  Do not mess with the karma..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, always for Togo orders, and things are usually fine. 
This most recent visit, it took more then 90 minutes, for one sandwich. 
I asked one of the bartenders a few times to check on it, but she said they were really busy and that is was to be awhile. 
I'm a very calm and patient person, but 90 minutes for a sandwich?!
When a different employee checked on me she was seemed horrified that I had been waiting for as long as I did. My food was actually done a when ago and had to be remade. 
No one asked if I wanted a drink or even water while I waited. 

I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"Love a place with a countdown to St. Patrick's Day clock! Lots of beer choices, not so many ciders."}
{"text":"I am with Justin on this one, I too would give 3.5 stars but the fact that I don't go back very often anymore demotes it to a 3 star.  4 stars are for places that I leave and immediately start planning my next trip to visit.  Muldoon's just doesn't have it.  

Some highlights that are a plus are the burger nights, free popcorn, and wing specials but what I like about Muldoon's are the various home cooked lunch specials that remind you of mom.  Last time I went in there for lunch, probably over 4 months ago, I got the open turkey sandwich with mash / gravy and broccoli, boy that was like the day after Thanksgiving.  Someone mentioned the pizza and that too deserves some higher marks.

Service can be crabby at times especially if they don't recognize you.  I always see police, fire, and ems in here eating lunch, sometimes dinner (late shift), so its safe to go into at any part of the day.  A typical night you'll see this place relatively busy, there's a very big parking lot so just drive by, the amount of cars will be a good indication of how busy it is (obviously).  All food is priced reasonably but be sure to ask what the daily special is.  I am due to go there for lunch in the near future, maybe I'll see you there."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing and comes out fast.  Our server was awesome and let me try a sample of 2 items to help me decide which I wanted. I didn't even request that!  She was just that good!! Will be returning again and again.   Best fish tacos around!"}
{"text":"Good food. Not the best I've ever had, but good for the fair prices. Good beer selection and fun Irish pub atmosphere. A safe bet to come and have a good time.  Neighborhood staple and does well for good reasons.  Been here many times and will be back"}
{"text":"Apparently Thursday is the day to go. We had a large group and we all shared $3 cheeseburgers and wings and fish tacos and free popcorn. Draft beer selection was good. Servers were nice but got a bit flustered keeping our orders straight, she seemed to be new. But we had fun, food was good, and we didn't have to wait that long. When I'm in this neighborhood, I like to come here."}
{"text":"I'm probably at Muldoons a few times a month. Never disapointing - always fun. Can sometimes get super busy (that's cuz it's so good!) and the staff, management and owner are SO nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Eat here every time we are in Cleveland. Dolores is great and personable! Great selection of beer and the food is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Muldoon's about once a month, after a rigorous volunteer shift at the nearby Cleveland Food Bank with my friends. 

I am obsessed with their panko-fried grouper! Now that it is Lent, I've been thinking a lot about my favorite places for fried fish (even though I'm not even Catholic), and Muldoon's is the place that I keep coming back to! I can't wait to make the trip out to the East side just to get a big helping of delicious fish and chips!!

A bonus at Muldoon's: I LOVE places with freshly popped popcorn to eat while waiting for a table / food to arrive. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I've tried to make a point of visiting local businesses around me and have been going here about once a week for the last few months.  Honestly, I don't think the food is anything special but a few tips may point you in the right direction.  First, if you like Reubens or corned beef and cheese, you should definitely give the Irish Egg Rolls a whirl.  These are fricking good.  Second, free popcorn.  I enjoyed the large/quirky/confused chopped steak salad, the grouper is good but overpriced imo (I had the panko bread crumb version, the platter not the sandwich).  A tall(BIG) light beer, mediocre and small cheeseburger, and tasty/avg onion rings will run you less than $10 on a Thursday $2 burger night.  Wings are 40 cents on Thursdays as well, but you must order 10, ie $4 for 10 wings.  I haven't actually tried them yet but they look pretty tasty.  I like the atmosphere of the place.  It's very blue collar but also a place where family and friends meet up on a regular basis.  I'm pleased to say that they remembered my regular drink/beer order after just a few visits.  

They have some big flat screen tvs so watching a game there would be cool (if they turned the game's volume on)..."}
{"text":"Wow! So impressed!!! I had a great time eating with my friends who are regulars here. Food was great at wonderful prices. Nothing to complain about here. Drinks were strong, beer was cold and fresh, food was on point. I would not expect having this type of food from a place like this. Very impressed and they will be getting more of my money! Thanks for the great time."}
{"text":"Gotta admit I totally would never stopped in if my lover had not mentioned how great this place was. Bartender an owner totally made us feel comfortable and remembered our names when we came back 3 weeks later. My go to dish is the BBQ chicken chipotle chop salad but the wings blew my mind also. Plus wing night is monday they Thursday 55 cents each! Spacious outdoor patio, comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff with reasonable prices. I'll become a regular here and this will be my new Cheers where everyone knows your name"}
