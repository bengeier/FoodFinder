{"text":"The food here is sooo good, especially the Chicken Lo Mein, General Tso's Chicken, and sweet and sour chicken.  The portions are huge, the sweet and sour chicken is always made with the sauce on the side, so it is still crisp when it arrives, not soggy.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars from me is the pieces of vegetables in the dishes are too large.  It's my go-to Chinese place; fast delivery."}
{"text":"Would recommend only doing take out.  Food is very good and at a good price.  Best Chinese food for your buck.  Dont judge a book by its cover from the outside appearance.  Im a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The food wasn't as jaw dropping as one might expect from other reviews. It was average, but not bad. The staff was friendly but I wouldn't want to dine in so we got your food to go."}
{"text":"Please don't waste your time or money!  Absolutely horrible, it taste as bad as the building looks! HORRIBLE SERVICE TOO!"}
{"text":"Love this place. When I crave Chinese food, this is where I go all the time! Tried other places around here and can't be beat. Very affordable. Best Chinese food place around!!!!"}
{"text":"This little gem is hidden between a smoke shop & a Circle K, but despite it's location, I came for cheap, reliable Chinese food.  Better at take out & delivery than dine-in, the decor is decidedly...last minute. 
But I love every bite I've had!  The moo goo gai pan is my favorite, but I love others just as well, and they are always quick!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"our family has ordered from this restaurant for a few years. Lately the food has been mediocre,  sweet and sour sauce was luke warm last time, I had to heat it up in order to use it. We always order delivery.  Breaded chicken was just ok, vegetables were still raw in sauce."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and didn't know what my delivery options were. Based on the reviews, this place sounded like a home run. I was so disappointed! The food is reasonably priced, they deliver for $12 min, and delivery was quick, so it warrants 2 stars. I also love the fried noodles they included with my soup. Unfortunately, everything about my General Tso's combo was subpar. The meat was all dark meat, and some of it quite fatty. The fried shrimp that came with it tastes old, as did the rice (and who messes up fried rice?).  In the unlikely event that I order from them again, I will steer clear of the chicken!"}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago I found a menu for New North China on my door. First off, how long can a place be open and still be new? Anyway, I wasn't in the mood for pizza and didn't want to go out. I ordered some General Tso's Chicken, a dinner special, and a small order of house lo mein. The total was $17 and some change. I thought this was high, and was informed they have a $2 delivery charge.

When the food arrived, I was excited for some delicious Chinese food. It wasn't delicious whatsoever. As a matter of fact, it wasn't even good. I am VERY disappointed in this. It feels like a waste of money, and I am sitting here on a Saturday night hungry. I won't be ordering from New North China again. I would recommend you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got a flyer on my door for this place so I decided to give it a shot. Best decision I ever made. My girlfriend and I ordered the pork low mein, chicken fried rice, orange and teriyaki chicken for takeout. It was a huge load of food for just under $40. This place definitely does not skimp on the portions; we only ate about half of what we ordered (the rest will definitely be leftovers). It's a small family owned place that is now my go to Chinese takeout spot. If you're looking for quality Chinese food, look no further than New North China."}
{"text":"My son and I had the chicken fried rice and it was excellent. Very good flavor and lots of chicken. Also ordered the crab puffs which weren't bad, but I wasn't as impressed with them. (Am I the only one who remembers when crab puffs actually had crab in them?) We ate in and had the place to ourselves on a Friday night. Clean inside, tables looked brand new or like they are hardly used. Food arrived to our table hot, and plates and utensils were spotless. Service was ok, not rude but not very friendly either. I'm thinking this is a nice place to go to when you want a more quiet setting than the usual Friday night crowded restaurant. Several people picked up orders while we were there and I heard then taking a few delivery orders, so it appears, as others have mentioned, this it more of a takeout place. Nevertheless I was pleasantly surprised with the neat appearance inside. The location sits between a laundromat and a smoke shop, but don't let the whole-in-the-wall exterior shy you away. It's a decent place with good food."}
{"text":"We've been on the lookout for inexpensive and tasty Chinese food. We're done looking! This place isn't fancy, but our take-out was delish! The pork egg foo young was super, and the honey garlic chicken was perfect. Crispy chicken with the right amount of sauce. The people running the place were very friendly, and the food was ready very quickly. And they deliver... We'll probably do delivery next time."}
{"text":"What a surprising little nugget this was! We did take out (menu online), so I can't comment on the inside of the restaurant. Yeah, I waited in the car... Didn't see a point in both of us going in. 

We got home and WOW! First off the portions are huge! I was starving and barely dented my meal. They had 6 veggie options. I opted for the orange tofu. It was so fresh and cooked to perfection. Also had red chili peppers and broccoli. Perfect amount of sauce, tons of tofu, awesome flavor, tender rice, and even great presentation in a to go box! Topped with an orange slice and all. The chicken lo mien looked great as well and the husband enjoyed it so much he's now hating himself for eating more than he should have and curled up in a big stuffed ball. 

Great prices, diverse menu, friendly staff (some language barriers present, so speak slowly), and just yummy. 

Added a star for having varied Veggie options as well. 
*They deliver"}
{"text":"i love this food it is so delicious!!! and they give you A LOT for a cheap price. THe delivefy deal is awesome! Free chicken fried rice or 2 liter of soda on orders over $20!!"}
{"text":"love this place so much. the food is amazing and the portion sizes are HUGE. definitely the best bang for your buck. lunch and dinner specials are awesome. I really can't say how much I love this place and recommend it to the highest caliber"}
{"text":"I would give negative stars if I could. I'm from boston where we have fantastic Chinese food and as a transplant I'm always searching for decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this is the worst I ever had. So far little Peking on Shea and 32nd is as close to good Chinese food as I've found. 
If you're an easy coast transplant constantly looking for good food to satisfy your craving for delicious food....avoid this terrible place."}
{"text":"Order took hour and 40 minutes and they forgot the fried rice. Never again!"}
{"text":"Wow. Seriously wow! You would never guess food so good comes from such a bad looking location.

Trusted my fellow reviewers and stopped by for lunch. Boy, am I glad I did. Ordered the chicken with vegetables lunch combo. The dish was near perfect. The veggies were crisp and tasted fresh, just the right amount of tender chicken, and the sauce was exactly what it good chinese should be... light, not salty, not syrupy, not sweet... just right. The rice was also perfect. I detected no MSG flavor. When you order a dish with vegetables, you should be able to taste their sweet freshness, and that's exactly how my dish was prepared.

If you put this meal on a fancy plate, you would gladly pay $20 and enjoy every bite.

I took off one star because the dining room is not much to look at. A little dark, a little cluttered, but clean. Obviously, the bulk of their business is take-out and delivery.

Note the name change: New North China Restaurant. Employees were friendly and my food arrived quickly. Without a doubt, I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a great little chinese joint that delivers and which has saved me many times as I've been hungover on the couch too tired to move.  The Egg Foo Yung is tasty with a great brown gravy.  The Beef Lo Mein is a great dish as well as the Chicken Fried Rice.  They usually make it pretty quick to the house and are"}
{"text":"One of the few places that delivers to my area. Average food, good sized portions, fast delivery. They do, however, scrimp on the vegetables in a combo meat/veggie dish, although I guess that's better than scrimping on the meat lol. 

Lemon chicken: LOTS of chicken, decent lemon sauce
Shrimp fried rice: 4 big shrimp, mostly rice and a few veggies


Will try again if I'm in the need for delivery."}
{"text":"We tried it a few times because it's one of the few places that delivers... It is downright awful. Pork Lo mein was burnt. One of the simplest dishes, how can you screw that up?? Overly greasy overall - I could wring out egg rolls etc. Plus they have no notification of hidden fees on their menu for delivery - imagine my surprise when one time it was a $2 surcharge and another time it was $5??
I would rather pick up good food than get ripped off."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new Chinese restaurant and I'm very impressed. Nice white meat chicken in the fried rice and same in the cashew chicken. My new favorite place"}
{"text":"my son and I just ordered delivery from this place because we got a pamphlet and the door, we ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the kung pao extra spicy!!! fantastic the only reason not a five star not enough sauce on the sweet and sour next time going to ask for an extra side!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever.  No egg in the egg foo young, was like a corn meal lump covered in gravy.  The white rice was under cooked.  Really not even the rice was decent."}
{"text":"Walked in owner was stuffing his face and was rude and abrupt to me.\" Did I want to order food or what\"? It stunk and was dirty. I don't think so jerk!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst meal I've ever had delivered. Mongolian beef was tough and the pork fried rice was almost uneatable  Definitely the last time I'll order there"}
{"text":"Best delivery Chinese in the area. Huge portions and good quality. We like their dinner combos, especially the chicken and vegetables. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall quite possible has the best Chinese food in Phoenix.
Deffinitely the best Wor Won Ton soup and pork Egg Foo Young.
Great for carry out and they have a large delivery area!"}
{"text":"Super tasty and fresh Chinese food in a dumpy whole in the wall building. They deliver but I like coming and and chatting with them. They have all the Mandarin and Cantonese favorites. 
Next time I'm going to branch off into chop suey or egg Foo young compared to the delicious sweet and sour chicken and the D12 combo dinner with the upgrade  ($2) to BBQ pork fried rice. Totally worth the money to upgrade your combination dinner!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for Chinese food in the north valley! When I find a good Chinese restaurant I stick with them.  This is that one. Great tasting crab puffs, great mixed vegetables,  great lo mein and sweet & sour chicken. I usually get the lunch specials at about $6.  This place will be my #1 choice until I am forced to find another place (if they go out of business or their food changes)."}
{"text":"The North China restaurant is very clean and organized. Their customer service is fantastic. It is a small business and family owned. The dish is delicious. They offer excellent portion sizes and it's a pleasant restaurant. Thank you for an exceptional dining experience."}
{"text":"Lady on phone was rude and would not take there coupon, food was not good, way too much breading on shrimp and general chicken was hard as a rock. 
I would have to pass not impressed at all, kids wouldn't eat it either."}
{"text":"Yummy!! My boyfriend and I got a flyer on our door for this place and we ordered the \"Family Meal A\" which said it served 2 people. We are big eaters and even this was A LOT of food for us. We got 2 huge boxes of beef and broccoli and sweet and sour pork, 4 crab puffs, 2 egg rolls, a box of rice, and an enormous container of soup!! It was all delish and all came SUPER hot and for less than $25! I was a little worried because some yelp reviews said their stuff came unfresh and cold but that was the opposite of our experience. Ordering was fast and easy and it took about 30 min for delivery. We will be ordering from them again. :)"}
{"text":"First Time trying NNC today, they left a flyer and we ordered via delivery.  Food was good, nice flavor, hot and the vegetables were so fresh and crisp.  Order was 100% accurate, and delivery was fast.  I loved it, the kids loved it and we will definitely order again from them.  We will probably not order the BBQ Pork Ribs off the appetizer menu again....but, the General Tso's Chicken, Vegetable Lo Mein, Kung Pao 2 and crab puffs were AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally found a place to get decent Chinese delivery! I wish we had tried them sooner. The shrimp in the fried rice were large and delicious. Chicken egg rolls were very tasty. Delivery was quick and of course the food was hot, especially in this weather. LOL! Will defintely order from them again."}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars i would. We ordered delievery Of beef and broccoli and cashew chicken. When it arrived what i got was not cashew chicken. It had no cashews in it, mushrooms,  onion, green bell pepper, water chestnuts, and carrots. I called them to see what i receieved, also to mention that i am allergic to mushrooms. They told me that this is their cashew chicken, that the water chestnut is the cashew. They argued with me, i told them i would like a refund of that portion. The woman on the phone told me more than once to never call there again. Wonderful  customer service."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around. Took me awhile to find a good place. Finally!! Crab puffs yummy : ) Dinner specials are large and filling. Enough to share. Quick service, especially fast if you are grabbing pick up on the way home from work!"}
{"text":"The staff is rude the place was filthy. The food was deplorable. No need to say any more and needless to day I will NEVER return. And should you think I'm exaggerating look them up on the AZ Dept of Health and see the list unsanitary violations and improper food handling. YUK!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3 1/2 stars, I will definitely order from here again. We had delivery and the prices were good and the food was above average, HOWEVER, I wouldn't drive to go to this restaurant. It was convenient and above average delivery and we will definitely order again, but this isn't one of those places were you think, Wow, I've got to have some North China Restaurant tonight.

Delivery was quick and food was warm."}
{"text":"My local Delivery place.

I like them over others because the food and portions are excellent as the pictures show.  Unlike some places they don't fill the box full of veggies and give you almost none of the item you ordered.

They even remember my special order.
I order their Pepper Steak and ask to add mushroom and no peppers or onions.
It always comes full of Meat and Shrooms and taste so good.

Their staff is also friendly over the phone and their drivers are also friendly.

10/10"}
{"text":"You guys put WAAAAY too much onions on some entrees I just received the Mongolian beef and you used 3/4 of an onion and it's jus a waste of ingredients and it's excessive so please change that and I'll be around more and will have better business:)"}
{"text":"Thank God! After many trial and errors trying to find a decent Chinese restaurant that delivers, North China Restaurant fills the bill. The sesame beef, General Tso's and house lo mein are really good. Pass on the fried rice and shrimp with lobster sauce though. Those dishes aren't bad, but definitely not their best."}
{"text":"Love the portions and fair prices. The food is always good and we usually pick up but have had it delivered quickly too. I gave it only four stars because the inside needs to be remodeled so we can eat in sometimes without feeling like we have walked into their family room."}
{"text":"These are doing amazing.  Every time I order I feel they are getting me exactly what I want . Kind regards etc. Just thank you!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and came to pick it up. It was ready when we got there. The employees there were nice. The portions were very generous.  And overall the food was really great! Ordered the beef chow fun and the general tso chicken. Would recommend both and definitely plan on ordering from them again. Probably wouldn't eat there, but the inside was obviously kept clean they had plenty of tables. Just not a fan of the businesses next door."}
