{"text":"$22 Italian battleship deal gets you 2 giant (two foot long) Italian hoagies, big bag of chips, and an ice tea. Their subs are delicious!! Feeds two of us for the whole weekend. Call ahead! 

Also has a small market within the store with  deli-style items (jarred peppers, oils, spreads, etc). Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian & my co-worked pick these up one day. Got one with just the cheese (+lettuce, tomato & onions) It was DELICIOUS. Their bread was so fresh. I loved it."}
{"text":"The best hoagies around! Had these for my niece's graduate party and we're still eating the leftovers four days later and their as fresh as the day we got them! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place beats the Triangle in Swissvale! Meats are quality and the service is great.  The rolls they use are amazing."}
{"text":"Great people, and even better product. Always helpful and insightful when ordering. They use top of the line meats and it's always fresh. We always use Pirollo's for sandwich rings for events, and also enjoy ordering hot sandwiches to go at our lunch break. The hot sausage is some of the best around! Great local joint!"}
{"text":"Amazing value, amazing food and amazing owners. This small deli puts out some big flavors...Their hot sausage is homemade and delicious. Their hoagies are fresh and loaded with meat. Everything is an extreme value and it's family owned and operated; so you can feel good supporting a mom and pop operation. 
My only complaint is they aren't open on Sunday's (I'd love to get subs for the Steeler games.)"}
