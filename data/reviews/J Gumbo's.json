{"text":"Not really ever been a fan of the New Orleans style food scene but I have to say this is some tasty stuff. Very well prepared. If you want to break out of the sub/pizza/burger routine then I think you should give this a try. Menu is very foreign to most of us so ask questions or get a sample. They are very nice there. I think this is a place I will put into the rotation every so often for something different. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Considering it's a fast food place. Not bad at all.  I gave I had worse Cajun food at much nicer and more expensive places that were not as good. Oh and when they say it's sticky like voodoo chicken it's actually really spicy ! Usually in chain places heir idea of spicy is weak."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were very good. We were greeted promptly and with. Welcoming smile. Étouffée had a good amount of crawfish.  Bumblebee stew and white chili, very good. But, wait until you try the cornbread! Delicious."}
{"text":"Good cajun style food!  The bumbebee stew is the BEST!!  They will let you sample anything!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out while in town for a conference. I expected more of a table service place, but it's not. Order at the counter and seat yourself. Nice place, though. Food was great, portions were ample, and prices were reasonable. I had crawfish étouffée and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"What a great meal.  Price is very reasonable.  Voodoo Chicken has heat but not a problem if you like spice.  Gumbo was very tasty and the Jambalaya had plenty of sausage as well as spice.  Will definitely find our way back!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite of slow cooked food in a casual setting. Reasonably priced and plenty of food. Drunken chicken (pictured) had good flavor with a bit of heat The bread has a nice chew. Good to have the option of splitting entrees."}
{"text":"I went to J.Gumbo's with my family tonight (As you can see by my profile pic :D) and i have to say it been a while since i found a nice looking bar that also has amazing food!! Usually you have to chose one ort the other like cleats. The food was amazing especially the CORNBREAD, I CANT STRECH THIS ANY MORE IF YOU LIKE CORN BREAD GET TOU BUT UP THERE RIGHT NOW!!!!  The service was also great,  The server that helped us was named rocco and he was kind and attentive, my drink was never empty, and my food arrived hot and delishious!!! Also my sister made a mess allover the table and floor by dropping her cherry coke and a nice young girl lexi promptly came to the rescue and cleaned the mess my sister made in no time flat!!! I look forward to going again and all you yelpers out there should do the same :D."}
{"text":".....Excellent Food, as the Manager here at J Gumbos We Offer Samples of All our Dishes. COME CHECK US OUT"}
{"text":"First timer. Ordered the Drunken Chicken and the Gumbo. The drunken chicken takes all the stars...in fact I would rate it 5 stars if I didn't order the gumbo. The gumbo had zero flavor. \"Literally\" none. Usually something with sausage has a strong flavor, somehow they managed to suck all the flavor out of the entire dish. Can't say that I will be a returning guest, but I would recommend the chicken dish to anyone."}
{"text":"Voodoo chicken just not very spicy, texture very dull, need some chunks of something to break up the monotony."}
{"text":"Arrived Friday night and it was very cold inside. Everyone was wearing thier coats. We were seated promtly and offered menu. I asked waitress if heat was not working she said they would turn up heat.  Menu was limited and no Mardi Gras specials. Drink order was taken and our food order as well. Food arrived promptly but my etufee was cold to the taste.  Waitress took it back and had it warmed up. My wife's food was somewhat hot wich leads me to believe that they don't have it hot and ready to serve. Was not satisfied with it in the least and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was looking for a real po' boy, and I was so disappointed.  Po' boys can be \"sloppy\" or they can have fried seasfood in them.  I was looking for a fried seafood one, but that wasn't an option.  So I tried the Chicken Zydeco one.   The taste of the meat was good.  No complaints there.  But if you are going to have a \"sloppy\" po' boy, you HAVE to have the right roll for the job.  This was a fail.  The French baguette is what is needed because the soft inside soaks up the juices, and the crisp exterior hold it all together, and prevents a mushy blowout.  There was nothing crisp about this roll.   On the other hand, the only way I could have gotten the Voodoo Chicken in my mouth any faster is if I just tipped the Styrofoam container into my unhinged mouth.  I got the po'boy for lunch and the Voodoo Chicken for dinner.  I opened up the Voodoo Chicken first, so I gave it a try.  Im a bit disappointed in the heat level, but that's just MY taste.  For a place trying to cater to so many people, the spice level Im sure is just fine for most.  Bite after bite after bite, I was eating it without a thought to stop.   The cornbread left a lot to be desired, but my Grandma and Mom made awesome cornbread.  Im used to it being cooked in cast iron and having a slightly crispy exterior.   This review is meant to shine a light on the Voodoo Chicken, though.  Everyone was right.  Its really tasty."}
{"text":"Only get the chicken dishes (generous portion sizes and flavorful) or the bumblebee stew (flavorful).  Everything else on the menu, which I've ordered, is underwhelming as the majority of other reviews acknowledge.  It's actually amazing how a deep brown gumbo broth looks so flavorful yet have not taste whatsoever; and you only get a small cupful of it!  Trust me, stick to the chicken and you'll have no regrets. It's what keeps me going back."}
{"text":"Been there twice so far.  I had the jambalaya...just the right amount of spicy and heat - loved it and highly recommend the dish.  My friend had the drunken chicken and she thought her dish was excellent as well.  They also offer samples!!"}
{"text":"Our daughter and grandson invited my husband and me to dinner at Harrisburg's newest restaurant tonight. As soon as we walked through the door, an employee immediately made eye contact, smiled, and greeted us warmly. As we considered the menu, she offered to let us sample any of the dishes. As the selections vary widely in their levels of spiciness, this is very helpful. I chose the Voodoo Chicken, one of the spicier dishes. I had the choice of several toppings. I asked the employee for her recommendation, and she suggested adding sour cream to slightly cool the spiciness. It was an excellent suggestion. With generous chunks of chicken in a rich and spicy sauce, the Voodoo Chicken was delicious and satisfying. My husband had the Gumbo, which he said was also delicious. He was disappointed that it had no okra, but said he would order it again. Overall, J Gumbo's has great food for a great price with friendly and helpful service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love their food. It's the best thing  you can get for this price on campus. The staff and the manager are wonderful people, they'll ask you what you like and let you sample all the different tastes before you order. Voodoo chicken isn't that spicy, and it's my favorite."}
{"text":"I initially went here because a friend of mine had tried their food at a charity event.  This place motivated me to create a yelp account so that I could right a review.  I am so glad they were at that event because I am in love!  Right off the bat they offer you a sample of any item on the menu.  This allows you to actually know if you are going to like what you are ordering.  I tried the bumblebee stew and said I wanted more spice.  The very helpful waiter recommended the Jean Lafitte.  It was a delicious mix of Voodoo Chicken and bumble stew.  My friend had their Drunken Chicken.  This one is delicious for someone who maybe doesn't want a lot of spice.  We did not realize how huge the portions were and everything sounded so good that we ordered the Crawfish Cheese dip as well.  It was fabulous!  I am already planning on going again this week.  Food can draw me in, but as a college student, what really brings me back is a great price as well.  You can get a huge bowl that will give you left overs or leave you really full for only 7 dollars.  They also offer and half portion or 4.50.   I recommend also grabbing a piece of cornbread.  You will not regret eating here."}
{"text":"Being born-and-raised in the Midwest, I am not an expert on Cajun food, but that won't stop me from reviewing one of my favorite eating spots in Champaign-Urbana.  A micro-chain with just over 30 locations nation-wide, this Cajun joint get 5 stars from me. Upon entering, you are confronted with a number of various Cajun options. These can be eaten on rice, tortilla, or Po Boy (perhaps even a couple of other options). Don't know what you want? No worries. They are always urgent to allow you to sample upon finding out that you're a first time customer. The options are helpfully labeled with 'x' number of peppers aside each listing - an indication of the spiciness of the respective dish.  I tried the gumbo the first time I dined at J. Gumbo's, which was not bad. It was a little bit too sweet for me, but that is a matter of personal preference. I found my dish afterward and have yet to look back --- Drunken Chicken. This dish is choc-full of flavor. It contains just the right amount of sweetness while packing the perfect amount of heat for one who enjoys moderately spicy food but isn't a daredevil. Get the green onions on top.  The garlic toast that is served with each dish is a perfect compliment. Spoon some of the dish on top of each bite of the toast and enjoy!  In terms of staff, they are always very helpful. The staff varies occasionally but is typically a selection from a group of 5-6 people. They enjoy offering you samples and are very helpful. The joint offers membership cards as well, which award you a free dish after 10 bowls bought, in case you're considering becoming a regular.  In sum, I have nothing bad to say about J. Gumbo's. It is a chain and has a fast-food style, but the food you are getting is remarkable. Stop by, it is sure to be worth it!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday night and the place was mostly empty. Man behind counter was super friendly and encouraged us to try many samples. So we did. Liked everything we tried but ended up with white beans chili and chicken V. Both were excellent! Really enjoyed the food and the service."}
{"text":"Second time we've been to j gumbos's and I love it! First time I tried the ratatouille and thought it was good.  But then they recommended the bumblebee stew. Awesome!! And it's vegetarian.  I've only been for dinner when it's full service, which I like. I don't think that's available during lunch. And this location has a full bar so I could enjoy a glass of wine.  Service was good both times, and David was super nice. Perfect place for a winter dinner!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an excellent Po Boy sandwich at J Gumbo. The Voodoo Chicken was spicey and good.  I fully loaded the sandwich by adding shrimp, sausage and jalapeños! Wow!  It cost $1.50 for each added item and the sandwich was still a great deal.  The portions are generous...the dishes served in bowls with rice were huge.  Great place to satisfy your cajun craving!"}
{"text":"I just walked there from my office on campus and carried it back.  I was generous on my last review.  Again I got a half size of Bourbon St. Chicken to go.  The gal behind the counter actually put rice in the container...then took some back out.  Tiny serving...with extra liquid from the chicken.  All of it leaked into the bag on my way back (of course).  this  person wasn't the slightest bit friendly and you would have thought that I was getting HER share for lunch.  Chicken was not shredded...probably because it was tough. Stingy with food...non-interested help.  I'm probably not going back.  I'm not a huge person, but I like to get enough food for my $ to call it lunch and not a snack.  Thank heavens for the bread! I think this place changed ownership over the past couple years, and it shows.  Not half what it was with the original owners."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, but service was quite poor. This place was very much like an airport restaurant so don't go here if you're looking for a Pappadeaux style place to sit down and enjoy a good Cajun meal. There was one guy up front who was very slow and one girl in the kitchen - all serving about 20 people. Ambiance was lame, my food was served in a plastic bowl and the patrons were all getting quite impatient."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch now. I really liked that they let you try samples of all of the different entrees before you place your order, so you don't end up getting something you don't like. I really liked the drunk chicken. They give you a ton of food for the price too."}
{"text":"If you like frozen soup served over boil in a bag rice, this place is for you. Nice that they give you samples but everything tastes the same."}
{"text":"Please update your hours on here. I talked up your restaurant to a friend, so you can imagine our disappointment to arrive... and you are closed \"early\". You do you, but it would behoove you to update all major platforms when changing things like hours of operation."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of the Cajun food from J. Gumbo's. The other day I came in and had no idea what the food tasted like. The staff allowed me to sample as many dishes as I wanted. None of the dishes were bland but some might have had too much seasoning. The restaurant seemed to have a variety of dishes that catered to a wide variety of palates. If you prefer spicy food I would highly recommend the voodoo chicken but it might be too spicy for some spicy food eaters. For non-spicy eaters the drunkin chicken is a great choice."}
{"text":"One of our favorites!! First experienced J Gumbo's in Louisville. We were thrilled to see a new store open in my home town over the Christmas break in Harrisburg, NC. I went in to grab my favorite, Drunken Chicken...of course they were out. It's the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is great. If you are a college kid like me, it's an excellent joint to have nearby. The food is priced fairly, the portions are generous, the wait time is non-existent, and, most importantly, the food is absolutely delicious. The location itself is kind of dingy, but it's clean, and they offer convenient takeout, so there's no need to knock it for that. Just know that if you are looking for pleasant a sit down restaurant, this isn't the place. If you are looking for a large, flavorful, delicious meal at a fair price, this IS the place."}
{"text":"Giving this 4 stars but tonight it was more like 3.5. I've been to 3/4 locations. I have come to enjoy the drunken chicken/bumble bee stew combo with rice.  Temperature was off tonight which was disappointing since I'm from Orlando and this was a must on my food list during a visit.  I guess maybe it was because it was about an hour and a half till close and I'm a Monday.    Place is clean and new, hopefully it was just bad timing today although timing should never be an issue when You want to hit up a spot in my opinion."}
{"text":"Although I appreciate Cajun food, I found the food to be tasteless even though the portions were great for the price (under $8 for two dishes).  I ordered the red beans and rice and bourbon chicken. I was expecting chunks of bourbon chicken but it was shredded. I believe the red beans and rice came with some andouille sausage, but the sausage lacked kick. Perhaps this is what J Gumbo's meant by how neither of these dishes were spicy since J Gumbos has a spice rating on their menu.  If/when I go back, I plan to go for the very spicy stuff in hopes of more flavor."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm a vegetarian so I always the étouffée without the crawfish. So good and if you're not a vegetarian, I still recommend that one! They also have great deals on Hooked so if you have that app, make sure to check out what deals they might be offering before you go in.  My only complaint is that I wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"I am from Louisiana and was in town on business.  Tried the crawfish étouffée and Voodoo chicken. Both were really too hot with pepper to taste the flavors. Étouffée was thick and pasty with very few crawfish. Needed to be more like gravy and more crawfish. Voodoo chicken was okay.  Just some suggestions. I did enjoy the music and decor though."}
{"text":"First time...last time... unfortunately food tasted good.  The unidentified object was mixed into my food. I didn't see that coming.   All their food except for the rice is pre made and set to the restaurant through a manufacturer."}
{"text":"My son & I had the gumbo, jambalaya and étouffée. The étouffée was spicy but not a lot of other flavor. Very bland. The gumbo was pretty authentic, the jambalaya was delicious. The garlic bread is delicious!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place yesterday after allowing my curiosity to linger for nearly a whole Spring semester.  I love cajun spices/flavors, but this was only okay for me.  I ordered the Drunken Chicken bowl, and while the flavors were pretty good, I think I was looking for a little more heat.  However, the portions were generous, and if you're looking for something quick & dirty, this is a satisfying alternative to your typical fast-food chains.  I'll be coming back to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"A mixed review.  As usual the food was good  and they give you plenty to eat.  I also ordered the \"daily special\", a slice of king cake.  The slice was razor thin and had large holes in it.  It can't weigh more than half an ounce.  At $1.50 that would be $32/pound.  I don't want to exaggerate and say biggest ripoff ever, so I'll just say it's in the top 10"}
{"text":"Very, very good.   Danielle and i decided to have J Gumbo's for dinner tonight after running some errands nowhere near Independence.   She had the chicken and Sausage Gumbo and I mixed the Crawfish Étouffée with with the Voodoo Chicken. we each also bought w piece of corn bread.   I tried her gumbo - or a slice of sausage from the gumbo. the sausage was good but i couldn't get much idea about the rest.   My meal was really good. At first the sauce/gravy in the Étouffée seemed a bit too thick for my liking but then i mopped it up with my bread and cornbread and absolutely loved it. The Voodoo Chicken was very tasty and quite spicy.   Holly, our server, was great. she offered us a sample of their bread pudding. I had to decline due to my diabetes. Danielle took her's home for later.   Speaking of Holly, i felt really bad. The place is set up weird. when you walk in you order at the front register. I paid with a card but didn't tip. i was confused thinking it was going to be a \"self serve\" kinda place. she however, took care of us real good and i had no cash or anything to leave for her after our meal.  i hope she's there on our next visit so i can make it up to her."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I had such a hard time picking out one dish, that I ultimately walked out with one of each.  You can't go wrong with eating here.  If I had any criticism, it would be that the Gumbo is not the best I have ever had, but all of their other dishes are amazing!  Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I had to check out this place after reading all the good reviews and it did not disappoint. (Also I had never had cajun food - so I had to give it a try) The smaller sized set menu consists of rice (white or brown), your choice if entree, a piece of bread and small drink - all for less than $6! Because I love spice, I got the Voodoo Chicken and it was absolutely delicious with a great kick of spice."}
{"text":"Just ran across it @ lunch time, so glad I stopped in.  The items on the menu don't get any better.  The food, value and service were excellent.  They get it ! Ya gotta go !"}
{"text":"In my travels since I have left the south I continue to seek out cajun/creole joints in search of that level of flavor I have been missing.  I found this place on yelp and I figured I'd give it a try.  What a great choice.  I walked in, still deciding what to get, when a gentleman asked me what I liked, whether it be spicy or not.  Based on that, he provided me samples to find exactly what I was looking for.  I had the Voodoo chicken and the Drunken Chicken.  Both were absolutely delicious. Deep flavor and cajun spice.  The Voodoo chicken was spicy, but not that abrasive over the top spice you get sometimes.  I strongly recommend this place and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been there twice now in the last month. First time I had the gumbo and is was spot on.  Owner gave some samples of th the voodoo and drunken chicken and they were great.  Went back the second time and decided to have the drunken chicken, once again the flavor of the food was awesome, except this time they poured it over a huge bowl of rice.  Way too much rice in my opinion and ran out of the tasty drunken chicken before I knew what hit me.    I will be back but for the 9 bucks spent, I had expected less rice (filler) and more of that tasty chicken, would have almost preferred it to be by itself in a bowl like a soup.  That being said, portions are huge. However I will be going back for the Gumbo t get more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"I love eating here when I want an actual meal that is easy and quick. The food is very filling and the prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you get. My favorite is the Bourbon Chicken and it usually takes me two sit downs to actually finish it. Above all, the staff is friendly and that makes my experience great every time I go there!"}
{"text":"Very nice customer service, the person behind the counter offered to let my friend an I try samples of the gumbo before committing. I went with the honey sriracha, medium spice but sweet! Highly recommend to try. Had a hooked deal for $5 for a large bowl. Took half Togo!"}
{"text":"Offers a very good spice level but anything down toward the bottom end of that is a bit over-bland. Food is plentiful for the price and the service is usually quite good, I eat there a couple times a week. Recommend the Jean Lafitte hands down."}
{"text":"Red hot chicken and drunken chicken are both really impressive. Spicy and flavorful. I've been twice and I need to get back more often: I forget this place exists.  The counter-staff were noticeably friendly.   Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Wow! This is amazing. If you like Cajun you will LOVE THIS PLACE.  The Jean bowl is out of this world ! So glad I stopped in today.   The staff was amazing- very friendly And helpful with the menu options. They let me try couple things for taste ( liked them all ha) . Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for first time and was happy to see such a wide selection of menu items from mild to very spicy. We ordered the red hot buffalo chicken and jean lafitte bowl which were both really delicious! Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"For a place with gumbo in the name the gumbo was horrible.  We ended up throwing a entire bowl in the trash because everyone though it tasted rancid. With that being said the  jambalaya  was  great. I would go back simply for the jambalaya.  The service I received was nice and friendly. I did takeout but I did sit at the bar and drink a beer while I waited for my food. The place seemed clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Came here after a movie yesterday because my boyfriend has been wanting to try it, and we were in the area. Decor was nice, warm and inviting and very clean. Our service was prompt and friendly, and our food came out promptly. I knocked off two stars because I wasn't enamored with the food at all, but it wasn't terrible. I ordered the Jean Lafitte Bowl complete with corn, black beans, voodoo chicken over top of white rice and topped with sour cream, cheese, and scallions. I have a few complaints about this dish. Firstly, it was way too sweet. Not just a hint of sweet...sickeningly sweet for a savory dish. The ratio of sauce to rice was approximately 1 part sauce to 2 part rice...barely any black beans or chicken. Also, rice was unseasoned and bland.    Boyfriend got gumbo and jambalaya. To me they were lacking spice and flavor. Again, both were incredibly underwhelming.   Drunken chicken po boy was decent. Needed something else than just chicken on an open faced bun. Perhaps coleslaw for texture and interest?   I wanted to like this place, but I probably won't come back because to me, the food was simply not memorable enough."}
{"text":"Finally something new in Harrisburg. For the record, I visited on the forth day they were open. Understandably, there were small kinks to be worked out, so I'll keep the review to the food.  Expect a fast casual place where they make your food at the counter while you wait. Think Chipotle, but instead of taco fixings on the hot plate, it's bins of cajun food.   I tried 2 entrees, Gumbo and Crawfish Etouffee. I set the bar pretty high for cajun food, as that's where I got my start. The chicken and sausage gumbo was okay. It was surely made from a roux, but was one tone -- not very complex.  The Etouffee was the better of the two. I would come back for the Etouffee and perhaps try other dishes as this place has great potential.   One odd thing is that they have \"po boys\", which apparently are their entrees scooped out of the the hot bins onto French bread. They may be great sandwiches, but if you're looking for a real cajun po boy, beware. They don't dress them out (lettuce, tomato, mayo), etc."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Louisville, where J. Gumbo's started, and I'm so happy to see it here in Urbana! What's great about the place is that they have enough of a variety for folks who are new to Cajun food to get on board. For instance, the Bumble Bee Stew is my absolute favorite, and it happens to be both vegetarian and gluten free. There are lots of dishes to try, it's incredibly fast, and the garlic bread is delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's really affordable, and I love the fact that you can get free samples... How can you go wrong with that?? My favorite it the Jean Lafitte with the Drunken Chicken instead of the Voodoo Chicken (which is what it normally comes with). This is also the only place in town that has Crawfish-- a big plus! The garlic bread is yummy, and it's free with every meal, made with real french bread. (50 cents for an additional piece!) You definitely won't leave hungry, even if you try the half portions. The counter-staff are also really friendly :)"}
{"text":"J Gumbos is so delicious and so different than any other restaurant on campus. I have never experienced real Cajun food before, but from friends who have I heard that J Gumbo's does it justice.   Some of my personal favorites include the voodoo chicken, which is SPICY! But delicious. The Bourbon Street chicken is a milder, sweeter option. The white bean chili is also delicious. They allow you to sample everything and also mix dishes.   The staff is also wonderful! They are so friendly and make conversation with the customers. I love it here!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  First fast food gumbo place I know of. The food is excellent and it has a bar and bands. I highly recommend it!  I have tried most all food and really think it's the best."}
{"text":"I am not sure what this food is but its not Cajun food as advertised. I had the voodoo chicken and it was a tomatoey spicy bowl of nastiness."}
{"text":"The Voodoo Chicken was so good that I ordered a second helping to-go for tomorrow. Set up a little like a deli, it's not super-fancy (which means no waiter to tip). The staff was super friendly, explained the spicy and non-spicy options, and offered samples right away. There was not a single marginal or overpriced menu item that I saw or tried. It was all excellent. Very unique for this area. All-in-all, it was a legit experience."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to getting some cajun food near me. I love crawfish etouffee. I got the chance to try it today and sadly I was very disapointed. It counter order only. Everything is a stew over rice. They were out of Crawfish etouffee, white chili and when my wife ordered the voodoo chicken the girl scraped up half of a portion and asked is that enough.... there was no chicken in it. She said we have some more coming they brought it to is 10 mins later. The tea was weak and the bread was so old it wasn't even edible. They need to have some management on site. The oldest person that I saw looked like they were 18. This is 8pm on a Thursday and it is not busy! I will probably come back just to try the etouffee but if its anything like my first experience i wont be back."}
{"text":"I got the Jambalaya and it was disgusting. I literally had 10 bay leaves in it (practically a whole tree). If you want good jambalaya go to distill. Don't waste your money on this food. The bread was dripping with butter. Perhaps this is good drunk food? I will never go back."}
{"text":"I went to J Gumbo's for the first time and had a good experience. The staff there are very friendly and the service was fast.   I ordered the bourbon street chicken and it was pretty good. I didn't expect it to be as sweet as it was but it was still pretty delicious. It comes with rice (white or brown) and this really delicious buttered bread. They have this roller type machine that butters the bread that's pretty cool to see.   I tried my two friends meals, they got the jambalaya and the drunken chicken. Both of theirs were good and I may be inclined to order the drunken chicken if I were to go back.  The prices are low and that makes it worth it for the amount of food you get. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for some Cajun food."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. I had the Drunken Chicken over white rice and it was very flavorful. My boyfriend had the same but he added cheese toppings. We were both full and satisfied. It was a hearty meal for an affordable price. My only suggestion is to serve the bowls with toasted bread. I will definitely return very soon and plan to get the Voodoo Chicken next. I'm so glad to have another close & convenient restaurant option in Harrisburg!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of all things J Gumbo's. I'm not usually a big fan of Cajun/creole style foods, but I dig this getup. They have a fairly large menu of meaty deliciousness you can get over rice, chips, or a tortilla (I'm not positive on that last one. Don't hold me to it). I like my food with a kick and I was expecting to find that here. The voodoo chicken looked and sounded so promising. It is exceptionally tasty, but it's only moderately spicy. Even though I was disappointed with the lack of heat, every dish I've tried was intensely satisfying. The Jean Lefitte is a must-try. Also, the Drunken Chicken is their most popular dish for a reason, it has an insane flavor profile. Whatever you decide to try, make sure to get the garlic bread. Who knew something so simple and effortless could be so insanely delicious. Grab a mint, your breath will raise the dead."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden gem in Urbana. The po-boys are fantastic--if you like spicy food, get the red hot chicken--and the staff are all super friendly and will let you sample around until you get what you want."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but this place is terrific. I've been there 3 times now, gotten something different each time, and the food tasted terrific! The garlic bread is also really good.  The employees (who I think are a husband and wife) are beyond friendly and always offer samples of their food if you don't know what to get."}
{"text":"This review is LOOOOOONG overdue!!! One thing I really miss about my alma mater is eating at J Gumbo!!! The voodoo chicken over rice was my absolute favorite!!! Spicy, perfectly seasoned, actual shredded chicken breast (I hate rib meat) in a tasty red sauce on a bed of rice. Buttery garlic bread comes with.   They have a punch card system!!! I feel like this was the main contributor to my freshman & sophomore 15.  I also like how they allow you to taste the chicken before trying it. Everyone has different taste buds, so it's great that they're cool about you tasting the food. I got to taste the jambalaya before buying, which I really appreciated.  I literally texted my sister the other day & told her to bring home some voodoo chicken and freeze it for when I come home for thanksgiving. I hope she follows through on her promise!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is the first review I've ever written, & it is solely because of my experience at J Gumbo's in Urbana, IL.  I've never had better service anywhere.  The couple operating the joint made the whole meal worthwhile.  The food was great & the staff was super nice.  I would recommend this spot to anyone who want's a cajun meal in the midwest & values giving their money to people who truly work and appreciate the customer."}
{"text":"Such value! What an awesome, quick, casual place for delicious NOLA food! I wish we had one of these near me in the Heights area (east side), although that may be a dangerous thing for my waste line. Tried the gumbo, jambalaya, drunken chicken, bourbon chicken, crawfish etoufee... all were awesome!!! Been here 3 times and will continue to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times now, it may be a bit out of the way but.... DEFINITELY worth it. I've never been less than blown away here. Chicken zydeco is my favorite, it's a sweet/spicy tasting shredded chicken and comes on top of a bed or white or brown rice and a slice of buttered bread. I would recommend getting the chopped green onions on top!   As far as value for food to price ratio.... Phenomenal! Huge servings for pretty dang cheap. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid fast food Cajun joint. I like to go here sometimes for lunch when I am working because it doesn't take long. Some of the food is pretty spicy! I had the Jean Lafitte bowl and a soda for $12.50. The people that work here are very nice. The place is decorated for Mardi Gras year round. It has a very fun atmosphere. I guess they have live bands during happy hour from 4 to 7. The employees were telling me that is very popular and packed during happy hour time. Me? I like to go home and get the hell off Rockside Road after work."}
{"text":"I thought that J. Gumbo was an independent business, but it turns out that it is a small chain. I love how it feels like a small business. The staff was all very friendly and gave their recommendations and answered our questions. They give out samples so that you know exactly which one you like the best.   You can mix the different selections such as chilis and gumbos if you would like. I went with just one dish, the Drunken chicken. It came with some garlic bread which was toasted and buttered.   You can order a smaller dish of any regular entree for $6 I believe. The big bowl is a lot of food, so consider getting a couple smaller dishes if you are with friends.   I thought my dish was perfectly seasoned. They offered green onions, sweet garlic powder, and sour cream so you can customize it to your taste buds. It was warm; it was comfort food.  I will definitely be going back to J. Gumbos and trying more of their selections!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Upbeat jazz, N. O. colors. On a Monday night, one lady cashiered and waited tables. Great service. Loved the gumbo - perfect spiciness. Husband liked his red beans and rice. We're passing through from CO, but glad we found this place"}
{"text":"This review is written for the true Cajun lover. All Pretenders or wannabe Cajun lovers need not apply. J Gumbo's location in Harrisburg has proven itself to be the truth in local Cajun cuisine.    I've stopped in here on three occasions and between the spicy jambalaya, The Red Hot Buffalo chicken and the honey Sriracha chicken bowl Big Bowl entrees on brown rice this place has quickly become a favorite of mine.   Today I'm broke from my big three regulars and tried the drunken chicken. The drunken chicken is described as a tender chicken slow cooked with garlic stewed tomatoes Cajun spices and beer and they call it this signature dish and in talking to the management that was there, they said it is truly a crowd favorite, probably due to being simmered in beer.  After devouring the bowl that I got over brown rice I can understand why as its just that kind of spicy where it doesn't run you hollaring around the block, yet gets your attention and pleases your pallet.   J Gumbo's, you have a winner here and I'm glad that you're in my route of regular travel on Route 49 as I can stop in appease my Cajun flavor desires with greater regularity..."}
{"text":"Drunken Chicken is a great slightly spicy dish. A great thing to change up the usual Asian take-out routine. Not a really large menu but everything I've had has been great."}
{"text":"Mmm. Take me back to Louisiana. I love this place. Everything is mushy and flavorful and mushy. I have soft spot for soft food. I am willing to embrace that my favorite meals could be considered by some to be a gross and desperate college rendition of Gerber's, and while I enjoy decadent, gourmet meals, J Gumbo's belongs to the former class and it's fucking fantastic. I give J Gumbo's five stars not because it's \"as good as it gets\" (we can surely all agree that this isn't a master chef-endorsed bistro), but because the food is delicious for its niche, a nice, fast, yummy gumbo place. Additionally, the staff is great. J Gumbo's outshines campus restaurants."}
{"text":"After posting my second review for 1 star, I received a sincere message from the biz owner, which made me visit this place again.  Crawfish ettoufle was still of the menu, sorry to see you go. I asked if they could make this, as well as the price.   6.25 bucks + tax = the maybe original crawfish ettoufle  yes it's crawfish ettoufle...but seemed that some flavor disappeared from the ingredient list.   idk why or just my perception. hmmm. it used to be 'heaven' and now is 'in the atmosphere'.  better than on earth right?"}
{"text":"The jambalaya I got here was meh. I visited this place when I was in Cleveland for a conference because one of my clients is the owner. I love cajun food, but the jambalaya was very plain. Dry, not very spicy, little meat...below average. Unfortunately, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered online through Yelp, asked for my phone number and pulled my name from Yelp. Sent as fax to them. Said I was the first to use it. Called as I was cresting Rockside to Brecksville to tell me my food was ready. Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Just landed in cold-artic blasting-snow falling Cleveland. Get to my hotel room, and dinner time arrives. Started looking around on here I did notice that there were plenty of good eating spots close to the hotel, so decided that Cajun was definitely what I wanted. Arrived at the place, and it was a nice chilled out spot, Nice place overall. Food was sorta salty, but it is expected with this type of cuisine. Spicy enough, which made it very pleasant to eat. Waiters were very helpful and gave me some free samples of their dishes. Overall, liked the food, Might go back if i get some time while i'm in town!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the drunken chicken which was excellent. Ordered take out via yelp and was easy to pick up. Owner was very friendly and if I lived in the area I would go back to."}
{"text":"I know I just ate out yesterday, but whatev's, I have no shame. Somebody needs to explore all of these food establishments! I am taking one for the team! My cholesterol is good so bring on another fried oreo! Just kidding! My nutritionist is gonna be pissed.   So I've heard about the J Gumbo's located downtown and it's been on my list to try so imagine my excitement when I discovered there's a location down the road from my work! A couple co-workers and I headed on out for lunch. This place is located in the plaza behind Wendy's and the Shell gas station on Rockside road. It's a bit newer as I think it opened up December 2014 so inside is relatively nice with a bar and some neat artwork on the walls (that crab painting has a Van Gogh quality to it). I also liked how they were playing some music by Tab Benoit. The lady at the register was friendly and when we walked in she had just brought out a tray of little samples for the customers in front of us to try. That is awesome! I am always so indecisive so I think it's great when a place let's you try a couple things to help you make up your mind. You can't always just ask about the items because staff will typically say \"Oh everything is good\".  I decided to do a mix and get two entrees in one bowl for $8.95. Half was the Crawfish Étouffée  and the other half the Bourbon Street Chicken (each bowl also comes with a piece of buttered French bread). One thing I need to mention is that when I asked for a cup for water I was given a regular sized cup! Not a tiny plastic baby cup! Thank you!! We were given plastic order number cards and sat down at a high top table where a staff member would bring out our dishes when ready. We didn't wait very long, maybe 5 minutes max. The food looks appealing and they definitely give you a decent sized portion that will fill you up. The flavors were great too. First bite of the thick/mushy étouffée and I was like \"eh\", but it grew on me and I really enjoyed the spiciness of it. Definitely made me drink a lot of water! I found there to be an adequate amount of sauce to cover all of my white rice, and although the crawfish meat was not overly abundant, there were some good chunks of it. The bourbon was on the mild side and had a sweet taste to it which I enjoyed. Lots of chicken in this dish. I think mixing the two really aided in making this meal so great because it then wasn't lacking in sauce or meat like other reviewers mentioned.   The only minor downside to our experience was that the food came out somewhat lukewarm, so my only suggestion would be to turn up temperature a little bit. Also, this isn't really a complaint, but I did notice we were just about the only women in the place. Lots of men; maybe they are more inclined to eat a heartier lunch than women?  After we were done with our meals, what appeared to be the owner or manager came over and took away our plates, graciously accepted our compliments about the food, and gave us $2 off coupons to share with our other co-workers. Overall we all enjoyed our meals and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Always delicious and fast. The food is so good and they will give you a small sample of you don't know what to try. The Chicken Red Hot is great if you don't mind a little spice. They add blue cheese to this dish. The added toasted/buttered bread is great for cutting heat. Add the Bumblebee to the Red Hot to get a perfect blend of sweet and spice! Love this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend told me about a gumbo place in champaign and I was immediately skeptical. He was itching to go back so I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Upon entering, the waitress was very helpful, offering suggestions of most popular items and allowing us to sample any of the items. I tried the honey Sriracha chicken, creole ratatouille and the bumblebee stew. I was impressed with every single one and couldn't decide. Luckily they allow you to mix two flavors so I got the sriracha chicken and bumblebee stew. Please note, I like sweeter foods, and all of the above are definitely on the sweeter side. The marriage of the two flavors was perfect and the French bread they give you with the bowls is incredible also! So much flavor! My boyfriend ordered the Chicken red hot nachos which were also very good - spicy, but good. Overall I was extremely satisfied with the service, quality and taste of the food and the price point. I'll definitely be back. Easily one of the best restaurants in champaign- at least to me!"}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to stop by J gumbos yesterday.  I had heard good things about the place, but just haven't had time to make it in. I stopped in around lunchtime, and people were in and out grabbing food to go and to eat in. There are booths set up on the side for you to eat at.  I would compare it to Chipolte as far as how it works, there is glass to look through before ordering and a ton of different options. You can also sample anything for free before you order to make sure that you like it.    I ended up getting the Buffalo chicken (over brown rice- you have a choice between that and white) and it didn't disappoint. The flavors were really good, but I would say that there could be more chicken in it. The portion was not that large in general.  I chose to upgrade my French bread to a piece of cornbread for a dollar. I think it would be nice to have the cornbread as the side instead of the French bread, it was really good.  There were A ton of different options as far as what you top your rice with.  I liked this place a lot, but I would say it's more for lunch just because of the portion size. My husband is a big eater, and this would not be the place to bring him unless they started giving a little bit more. Four stars for me!"}
{"text":"We made our first visit to J Gumbos on a whim. We hadn't heard anything about it, but we love Cajun food. We both ordered the Lafitte bowl (portions come in half or full bowl sizes). The full bowl is a generous-enough amount of food, even for $8. The bowl came with a choice of bread; we both took the garlic bread.  The Jean Lafitte bowl is half corn stew (sweet, cream-based) and half chicken stew (spicy, tomato-based). The corn stew was far too sweet for either of our palates (aka Bumblebee Stew, per the menu). The staff warned us that the chicken stew was extremely hot (aka Voodoo Chicken), but we found it only edging toward spicy. Fortunately, there was hot sauce on the table.   We had a choice of adding toppings of cheese, sour cream, jalepeno slices, green onions, and seasoning.We also had a choice of white or brown rice as the base (corn chips are another option). The rice was a decent texture in each case (with the brown cut to a finer grain), but the rice-to-stew ratio was off: way too much rice. The chicken in the chicken stew was finely shredded and there wasn't enough meat to make it very substantial. However, the ingredients were fresh (something that can be hard to find in campustown, where many places serve pre-frozen and re-heated fare) and the recipes not far off the mark -- if modified to reduce the protein for costs and appeal to a public not comfortable with more authentic, stronger Cajun flavors. The bread was nothing special: commercial and lacking in texture or flavor.  Overall: The food was decent, but not good or great. For the quality of the food, we each agreed we'd give it a 5 out of 10.  J Gumbos is a national chain, with franchiser-owners, with the next closest located in Bloomington, IL. At the Urbana location, the staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean and comfortable: a step up from a crowded fast food environment."}
{"text":"This fast-food restaurant chain serves red beans and rice, jambalaya, Bourbon Street chicken, creole ratatouille, gumbo, crawfish etouffee, white chili and other chicken dishes.  They are located in the building just south of Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.  We ate there on a Friday at noon and it was packed. My Voodoo Chicken was delish.  They were refilling the steam table because it was busy and the manager pulled out a plastic bag filled with an entree and squeezed the contents into the bin on the steam table.  This kind of procedure might be easiest and most efficient but the optics are all wrong. He should have carried the stainless steel tub into the back room, filled it from the plastic bag out of view of the customers, then returning to the front of the house with a piping hot tub of food. But it is quick, reasonably priced and the food was good.  The member of our group who got the Crawfish Etouffee was not as impressed with the taste. For no apparent reason they feel compelled to have two flat screen TVs which no one was watching, playing CNN as background entertainment while folks attempted to enjoy their lunch."}
{"text":"The samples were stellar (they let you try a little bit of the soups and sauces when you're ordering), but after ordering our entrees (we got the drunken chicken and crawfish étouffée, and nachos), the food was lukewarm and clearly frozen in its past life.   After a couple bites, the flavor starts to lose its novelty and the étouffée almost solidifies over the rice entree, and you'll start to realize that this place is a fast food new orleans chain (not made fresh in-house).   Definitely not a basis for real New Orleans food, but definitely will make you excited to try the authentic cuisine!"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite Champaign restaurants. They specialize in Cajun Creole and essentially give you slow cooked gumbo with a plethora of options. Everything I've had here has been great, but I'll draw attention to the Jean Lafitte, which is a mix of their bumblebee stew (corn, beans, tomatoes, onions, etc.) and voodoo chicken. I actually tried to replicate this because of how unique it is, and did a halfway decent job (still doesn't compare to the real thing). The portion sizes are EXTREMELY generous for what you pay, and the food is fresh and delicious. You absolutely have to try this place if you're a fan of gumbo."}
{"text":"Really good food, I like how it has a spice chart, and they let you taste the food before you try."}
{"text":"Good and filling. Nice spicy Cajun food. Big portions served with garlic toast. Not the world's best, but overall solid. No complaints.  Drunken chicken, voodoo chicken,  and red beans & rice are all very tasty. I add extra hot sauce, but most ppl think it's spicy enough as-is"}
{"text":"I have to say the food was pretty good.   However, the the Laffitte meal was really spicy.  I had the white chili,  it was good and not to spicy.   My husband had the gumbo, he was a little disappointed.  No okra or tomatoes were added.  He's from Texas and close to the Louisiana border.  So he was used to that gumbo. We also had the bourbon chicken, it was good.  The one thing to me missing were sides.  No vegetables at all.   If you like meat and rice and beans you are good to go."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend here for the first time a week ago. It's basically a fast-food creole restaurant in a strip-mall, so know that going into it. Service was fast and courteous, and the food was balanced but had a certain tinge of over-processed flavor. If you need a quick bite on this end of town, it's a fair option, especially for the price."}
{"text":"I am extremely sad and disappointed in the fact that I only discovered this place in my last year in UIUC. The staffs are all friendly and are willing to let you sample pretty much everything before you make your purchase upon request.   I am usually not that big on southern cuisine, but this place is the bomb! Not only do they serve gumbos over white or brown rice, they also serve it over nachos! The portions are huge for what you are paying for! I usually eat a lot so I can single handedly finish a full size serving, but my roommates who eat like a normal human split one serving into two meals. My personal favorite is the drunken chicken for those that are looking for some spicy kicks on your tongue.   They are extremely fast as well. All the food are ready to serve. Simply have to walk in , order, and enjoy yourself! They also have a punch card available for those that plans to visit regularly ( which you should! )"}
{"text":"Some of the best Cajun food I have ever had. I did a mix with three items with advice from the staff. They were very knowledgable and their suggestions were delightful!"}
{"text":"Great food fast and affordable!!! I have only gotten takeout, but each time I was offered samples and greeted by friendly staff.  Portion sizes are very generous and filling.  I have tried the Voodoo Chicken which is deliciously spicy as well as the red bean n rice."}
{"text":"the place is decent while the food served there is also satisfying. I have ordered a voodoo chicken which is yummy trough it's a little too hot for me. Anyway it's a good place for the lunch!"}
{"text":"I ordered a drunken chicken bowl, which tasted okay. In my opinion, the prices are too expensive for the portion size. However, J Gumbo's offers frequent deals on the Hooked app, so keep an eye out for those."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. The garlic bread is very yummy! The service is excellent. They will let you try the food before you buy it. Great place to go with friends and family!"}
{"text":"In Miami, I was so used to having a Pollo Tropical or Chicken Kitchen within a couple miles radius. Urbana has tons of food options, but no \"healthier\" fast food option. Then I was introduced to J. Gumbo's. They have quick, homemade-like meals. The drunken chicken and bumblebee stew are freaking awesome. If you're having an off day and don't feel like cooking or breaking the bank, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants on campus, and then I found out that they don't make everything fresh in house, rather everything they cook starts out frozen.  Regardless, though, the food is still amazing. I always get the Jean Lafitte which comes with the Voodoo chicken and bumblebee stew. The sweetness of the stew and the spiciness of the chicken combine really well together. They put a lot of melted cheese on top too! Portion sizes are huge, but the food is so good you can eat it all in one sitting. The food comes with a huge slab of buttered garlic bread, which is amazing in itself."}
{"text":"I had the gumbo, bourbon street chicken and crawfish etouffee here. Although I had no idea about cajun style cooking, I liked the first two of the aforementioned entrees. Just the right amount spices for my taste. The etouffee could have been better, turned out to be a little bit bland. The staff were really customer friendly and the serve size was adequate as well as appropriately priced. You can have a decent lunch with the small bowl for just $5~6 (beverage/ pop is not included). For this reason, I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We found this by accident and are so glad we did. The food is excellent and definitely reminds us of the Cajun we had in New Orleans. We tried the crawfish cheese dip, bourbon chicken, and jean laffiette. All were excellent."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place since I first saw it was coming to Harrisburg. Came in tonight and I was satisfied overall. The prices are reasonable and the portions were good. The staff was really attentive and helpful. This is basically a stew over rice establishment. They have something Called a po boy but it really is just stew over bread. They let you try the different stews which is a big plus for me. I ordered the buffalo chicken stew and it was really good, quite spicy and just what you'd expect. My husband ordered the drunken chicken po boy. He enjoyed it as well.   Two cons:  the po boy should be served on a plate as the stew was too soupy for the plastic basket/paper it was served in. It was difficult to eat without making a mess. Also the \"French bread\" was of grocery store quality. Not bad but not the crusty loaf I was hoping for.   Overall I like the price, quality of the food, and convenience. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was great. This was the first time my husband had Cajun. Now he is making me cook Cajun all the time."}
{"text":"J. Gumbo's is a fairly new fast-casual chain, and it's unique in that it doesn't have any natural predators.  No one is really pushing NOLA/southern style food like they are.  Sure, there's Popeye's but they're a fried chicken place, and have nothing on the menu that even comes close to this.    The first thing you notice is that the dishes are all simple.  You can get whatever you want, and have the choice of having it on bread or over rice.  Most everything is based on a roux, which is a very simple base for dishes.  It's a pretty clear play straight out of the fast casual playbook- keep complexity down to maximize speed and profit.    The first time, I had the crawfish.  It was alright.  The crawfish was a bit tough and overcooked, so I decided not to go that route.    The second time, I had the voodoo chicken.  That hit the spot. It was spicy, not too salty, and worth the time.    My biggest issue is that I feel somehow underwhelmed.  It's decent quality, but it's nothing that sets my world on fire.  The whole time I'm eating, I'm thinking that I could have made three days worth of my meal for the price I paid if I cooked it at home."}
{"text":"The food is tasty and affordable. I love the lunch social. I typically get a half bowl of drunken chicken or a half bowl with both drunken chicken and bumblebee stew. But what really shines about this place are the friendly staff (especially during lunch hour). I always feel at home here. As a bonus, I've gone several times during the lunchtime rush and been in and out in less than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I am impressed by the food here; it tastes fresh, homemade, authentic and not like a chain restaurant at all. The crawfish etouffee is my favorite but all the other seafood dishes I've tried here are actually really good too. The employees here are always friendly, the prices are good, even for students, and, as I stated above, the food is fantastic. I highly recommend this place, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"I dream about  eating half voodoo, half drinker chicken. Spicy, flavorful and delicious!  Perfect after a late night or anytime!"}
{"text":"We visited J Gumbo's today and we were not disappointed! Since relocating from the gulf coast, we have been missing good Cajun food!  This brought us back to Houston, New Orleans and even one of our favorite spots in Indianapolis.  I had the Jean Lafitte bowl with all the fixings.  Definitely get the toppings!! The bumblebee stew was something I would consider doubling up on in ANY entree as an add on.  It really was flavorful and broke through some of the heavier stew moments in the bowl.  My fiancé got a double entree bowl with crawfish ettoufee and drunken chicken.  Both are solid options and with the toppings and the roll that comes with the bowls, we were using our last scraps of bread to swipe up every last bit in the bottom of the bowl.  The ladies behind the counter were friendly and helpful and the restaurant itself was adorable and clean.  I love the artist who did the work on the walls!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've had opportunity to try J Gumbo's a couple times recently while students have been on holiday break, and I'm really glad that I did.   My favorite thing so far is the Voodoo Chicken w/ brown rice.  Very tasty.  They run a lot of specials on the Hooked app, which I rarely use, but it got me a free piece of cornbread the last time I was there.   The guy behind the counter (presumably the manager) was very friendly, and they will offer you some samples if you are having trouble deciding.    My first visit I tried both the Chicken Red Hot and the Voodoo Chicken and I haven't strayed from Voodoo Chicken since.   I have not tried the gumbo or jambalaya yet, but I intend to someday.   Orders come with a piece of toasted garlic bread.   You can basically get any of their entrees in a variety of mediums (po' boy sandwiches, nachos, bowls w/ rice).  For an upcharge you can get two in the same bowl.  I always get mine as takeout, so the full bowl is a standard square styrofoam take-out container.  Sometimes it's less full than others.  It's not a massive amount, but I'm a pretty big guy and it's plenty for me, and I felt like it was priced appropriately.  It's in a pretty crowded location with other restaurants nearby, so parking can be sparse and it's metered, so don't forget a little change or your phone app."}
{"text":"Voodoo chicken!! The food is delicious and I'm never disappointed :) the staff is always so willing to give samples too before you order. I always loved this place as a student."}
{"text":"J Gumbo's is my absolute favorite restaurant. I've been to this one, two in Saint Louis, one in Tennessee, and one in Indiana and they are all always delicious! You won't be disappointed by the flavor or the heat!   Chicken red hot is nice and spicy, but they have plenty of options for those who don't like it quite THAT hot. I have yet to try anything here that isn't some of the best food I've ever had.   The taste is very consistent across all of their locations, and the pricing is really good for how much food they give you."}
{"text":"I'm literally addicted to this place. I love everything about it. So fresh, decently prices, fresh as can be--and the workers are kind and willing to abide by the annoying requests to \"taste another flavor\". I would go here everyday if my wife let me.   Suggestions if you don't already, get the Jambalaya on the bottom of practically anything.   My personal favorites: jambalaya with bumblebee stew and zydeco chicken or on a normal day, drunken chicken with jambalaya.   Addicted--and this comes from someone who's been to NOLA and couldn't stand anything jambalaya or gumbo related. That's why I didn't try this place for a whole year. I'm ashamed of that decision!!!"}
{"text":"This place turns my software into hardware if you know what I mean. Their gumbo is hearty and delicious. It feels like you're ordering from a mundane cafeteria though. I find it interesting that they have a desserts section but nothing in it."}
{"text":"First time visit but it certainly will not be my last. What is so great about this place is that they allow you to sample all the dishes first. They have a variety like voodoo chicken, ratatouille, gumbo, white chili chicken red hot, other dishes all served over your choice of white or brown rice and you get a piece of garlic bread.   I sampled the white Chili which was pretty delicious and then sampled the chicken red hot. Between the two chicken red hot was the winner especially since I love spicy food. The meal was super delicious and the portions are great. I didn't get the big bowl but the small that I got was more than enough. The prices are nice for the portions sizes. I will definitely be coming back to try the rest!! The atmosphere was great as well."}
{"text":"I'm a guy who loves Cajun food, and this place hits the spot when I need a New Orleans fix!  The food here is tasty, the spiciness is accurately described, and the folks behind the counter are nothing but professional!   One of the unheralded selling points for me is a wide selection of Zapp's chips including spicy crawtater and voodoo chips. I've rarely seen those outside of Louisiana, and it's a delightful reminder of the crescent city!  I've eaten here a half dozen times and I'm sold!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food at below fast food prices. Rich, the owner, came out personally to insist I try samples of several other things besides my entree. I will be back here in a heartbeat. This is how you run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Surprising find in Urbana, extended hours (10pm) for late night takeout. Food is not cooked to order, and is served from the steam table at the counter, but for the dishes they offer this really helps develop the flavor.  On our first visit we had the red beans and rice (a little bland, not quite as smoky as I like RB&R to be), drunken chicken (very good), and bourbon chicken (sweet, and thankfully not that nasty teriyaki style bourbon sauce). The \"heat\" ratings on the board are pretty accurate for a mid-western palate, and but I think the food could use a touch more heat (yes, i could add some tabasco, but cooked in heat has different flavor than a couple of drops of hot sauce).  Price was right, it was fast, and food was flavorful. Its a keeper ... hope it stays."}
{"text":"The food is solid cajun food though it could definitely be spiced up a bit more, but over all no complaints at all about the food!  The service is absolutely fantastic, the staff is always super friendly and don't hesitate to give you a bit more of the food to make sure you leave full and content.  The price is absolutely reasonable for what you get and this is somewhere I often love to visit."}
{"text":"Super friendly. Great food.counter service. Siracha honey chicken, drunken chicken, gumbo, and nachos were all great.   Rice could be a little drier to soak up the sauce bit I guess the rice is true to cajun style rather than Asian"}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't come here sooner. Several of my friends recommended that I come here earlier. I had an opportunity to sample several of the gumbo dishes before I selected my choice. Unfortunately, I forgot the name of my dish however it has a perfect amount of sweetness to complement the rest of the gumbo. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"First time I have been to J Gumbos and was pleasantly suprised. It has a very good size bar and dining area that I noticed right away even though I did take out. I wish I knew about this place during the freezing Cleveland winter! Friendly staff that offered me some samples of a couple of different options. The only complaint that I have is they need to add a bit more sauce with the rice bowls. Taste was great but got a little bland once I ran out of sauce towards the end even with mixing it up before hand. I will definitely be back to try the other dishes. Overall this place is priced great and worth a try if you like cajun food."}
{"text":"J Gumbo was my first (and not the last) experience with Cajun cuisine, and they made it easy for me. When you arrive, the staff guides you through the menu and even offer samples. For someone who thought gumbo was jambalaya and vice-versa, this was super helpful.   I ordered a half-and-half combo with voodoo chicken and red beans/rice. I don't have a biggest tolerance for spicy food, but I thought the food could have been spicier. The voodoo is one of the spiciest they offer, and while flavorful, was missing the cajun kick I was expecting. The entrees are served over a huge bowl of rice and with a large piece of garlic toast. Entrees are inexpensive, filling, and packed full of different spices and ingredients. They offer vegetarian and healthier options for those on a special diet as well."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here. I got the 2 dish combo with the drunken chicken and crawfish etouffee with a bunch of extra meat. Both the dishes were really hearty and flavorful. They were quite generous with the portion size and I absolutely over-ate to finish the dish. Overall the food was good and the prices quite reasonable. I'd recommend this."}
{"text":"As mentioned in my previous review, I again went here to try out gumbo and jambalaya. Jambalaya tasted nice but I did not like the sausage in it. I did not like gumbo much. I won't say it was bad but I have had much better.  From next time, I will stick to drunken chicken."}
{"text":"Can I get a woot woot? This place is so yummy!  The staff are so welcoming and are always willing to let you try a few things. I've had the Jean Lafitte (I think I spelled it wrong). It's a mix of sweet, spicy and overall deliciousness. It has a nice stew and spicy chicken, topped with sour cream and jalapenos and cheese on top. I loveeeee it! You can break this into two meals if you get the full order. Usually, they have Hooked deals so be sure to check for that!"}
{"text":"Great food for price! I really love the options and combos they offer. Their hooked app deals are always really good too!"}
{"text":"As always I am traveling and came across this place. I'll start by saying TERRIBLE location, TERRIFIC food.  Completely blown away by this place and will recommend it as it was a great place to grab some Cajun cuisine.   I had the étouffée and added shrimp and crawfish to make it a manly serving of meat. Additional charge by the way, but worth it as I think it was the perfect portion for me. Huge bowl mostly rice but the taste was awesome. Also bought a slice of cornbread which was awesome, just sweet enough for my taste buds.   Great place and great vibe spending a lot of time in the great state of Alabama and the service was spectacular. The lady in the kitchen actually came out and had a great convo with me and details about the city since I was heading dt for the Cleveland Indians game. Kudos to J. Gumbos!"}
{"text":"2.5  It's a chain restaurant located in a strip mall in a Cleveland suburb. Some things are what they are. When it comes to JGumbos, however, some of those things aren't very good. But, let me start with the positives: 1.) When you walk in, it looks like a counter-service establishment. But, it's not. You get table service and that helps to elevate the experience and make things a little nicer; 2.) Speaking of table service, our server, Erin, was fantastic. She was sweet as pie, funny, patient, and incredibly helpful. She gave suggestions, offered samples and helped a group of people decide on what to get. She definitely helped make the experience much more than it could have been; 3.) HAPPY HOUR AND SUPER BOOZY DRINKS. Yes, JGumbos serves booze (as well as NOLA-styled eatery should). Yes, the drinks are good. Yes, the bartender had a heavy hand. Yes, the drinks come in pint glasses. Yes, the happy hour prices will make you over indulge. Yes, you should have a DD if you come here during happy hour.  BUT!  The food is awful. Seriously. It's not good. Like, at all. I can't say that anything looked appealing. Most dishes had the appearance of slop on a plate. I'm not even pulling the 'I used to live in New Orleans' card. This was just, objectively, nasty-looking food. If you eat with your eyes, you might go blind from starvation. Wanting to minimize the prospective damage to my stomach but needing something to soak up all the sweet sweet booze in my belly, I decided on the NOLA Nachos. I can hear you laughing. Yes, NOLA Nachos. That says it all. NOLA.Nachos. Some of the highlights: store-bought Tostido chips. Barely solid 'chicken.' Some sort of indistinguishable 'NOLA' sauce. Ugh. I can't write any more. The flashbacks are making me ill.  Come here for happy hour."}
{"text":"Restaurant review What an interesting experience eating southern creole food in central Illinois. This restaurant is tucked away on campus and is quite a rare find. If you like spicy some of these dishes will hit the spot. I ended up trying the crawfish etouffee which was amazing. The food definitely does not look good. When you look at my picture it looks like dog vomit however the flavors were off the chart. It has just the right spice and it served over a nice bed of rice. Although it is a little bit of a turnoff that the crawfish comes in little tubs that are premeasured out like subway. That being said you can't find anything like this here in Champaign   Pros: Unique dining experience, a must visit for people that like spicy food, inexpensive  Cons: If you need your food to look good this is not a restaurant  Hidden deals: Download the hooked app. Their frequent daily deals that change throughout the hours  Health code rating: A. Very clean and well kept restaurant. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1787"}
{"text":"Food was excellent as was service...you will leave full. Plenty of variety as far as Cajun dishes geaux. Take it from a Louisiana native this is some delicious comfort food."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and couldn't pass up a place with gumbo in the name, even if it is in Ohio. I was the only customer at around 7 pm, which was odd, but it didn't really help with the service. The girl was kind of rude and inattentive. The voodoo chicken was pretty delicious, but not as hot as it's made out to be. I took advantage of the hot sauce and spiced mine up quite a bit. The best thing about this place is they give free samples to indecisive people like me. I would eat here again, if I ever visit again, but the place only gets three stars because of the bad service."}
{"text":"I don't care if this is a chain, J Gumbo's is now a winter go-to spot for me. My fiancee loves anything Cajun and had a craving for it so we stopped in. Yum! The drunken chicken is so delicious, warming, filling and spicy!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my food at JJGumbos. I've been in the past and enjoyed every morsel on my plate. The staff was kind and I got my food quickly. I got it to go due to a 12:30 meeting and ate it in my car. I ordered the crawfish etouffee; the rice was terrible. Every time I took a bite, I bit into a mix of hard and soft rice. It didn't matter where in the container I dug in, there was hard rice interspersed in every bite.  I probably ate five bites and gave up since I was spitting out the hard, chunky morsels.  It was a waste of $8.25."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since I was taking a class in independence. The place was clean and newer looking. It was a Saturday around 11am so it wasn't busy. I ordered the Drunken chicken per the recommendation of the waitress at the counter. They brought it out in less than 5 minutes. It tasted unique and very good with a slight spicy kick. It was over rice with garlic toast. I'd come back here again to try the rest of the menu. They also seemed to have happy hour specials at the bar."}
