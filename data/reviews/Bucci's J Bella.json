{"text":"I came in for happy hour and was the only one at the bar. Both TV s were on something like nothing. I asked the bar tender to put on  espn. She did. She put espn on one tv and her daytime show on the other. Then she cranked up the volume on her show. Guess I should go home to watch my channel. After all, she is at work, so she must be entitled. I'm just a customer...."}
{"text":"I really like this place e eventho i think my mother can cook her italian
food better. She cant be available all the time lol
their portion is generous
prices little high but over all goodgood"}
{"text":"Went for the first time during happy hour, was not all that impressed. I ordered the meatball parm rigatoni, the macaroni was mushy and overcooked while the sauce had very little taste. I should have returned it but I ate half and then just ordered a pizza which was a bit better..."}
{"text":"Another great meal.  Gnocchi bolognese was incredible and the chicken parm was not only very good but could feed two easily. Service is alway friendly and efficient.  Clearly my favorite Italian restaurant in the area.  My grandmother from Sicily would have been pleased."}
{"text":"I always have a great meal at J Bella.  Their Chicken Parmesan is the best anywhere.  I just recently tried the beef short rib and it was absolutely fantastic.  The prices are reasonable especially for lunch.  When I consider the price and value I have to give J Bella high marks."}
{"text":"I've gone here for lunch a few times and enjoy the meal each time. They have a very friendly staff who always makes sure to greet you when you walk in. Accommodating for business meetings and to talk in a quiet area for a decent amount of time. Greatly appreciate the quality service they offer. Very close to giving five stars. A little more pizazz in the flavoring and it'll get there."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the bartender Amanda and Angela are great and very helpful when it came to the knowledge of the menu since I had not tried this place before. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential! However, we felt like we were being rushed out. Which was odd considering there was no wait. Salads came out on top of appetizers. Entrees came out before salads were finished. 

I ordered the filet mignon. The color and flavor were good. But something wasn't quite right with the cut. It cut too shredded to be a filet. Filets are supposed to cut like a stick of butter. This cut like a shoulder.

My fiancé ordered the seafood fettuccine which came out in an awkward shaped fish bowl which made it difficult to toss and the sauce was very watery and scallops rubbery. 

On top of all of this the server seemed generally annoyed with our existence. Like us being there was an inconvenience. Won't go back. Which is a shame because we are looking for a local go-to restaurant to satisfy our wants."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I couldn't for a few reasons: 
1. It's so loud in there you can't carry on a conversation with the people at your table without yelling or asking \"what?\" repeatedly. 
2. The decor is SO DATED. It looks like it's still 1995 in there. Burgundy paint on the walls makes it so dark. The light fixtures are dusty. It definitely needs to be freshened up.  
3. We were unfortunately seated right in front of the restrooms and I kept getting smelling public bathroom smells. Very unappealing. 
The food: The food was FANTASTIC!! Seriously delicious. Hub had the chicken Parmesan and I had the lasagne. Wow. Both were absolutely delicious. We ordered the garlic bread with cheese and while it was good, I would pass next time. The cannoli was really good, but they weren't completely filled which always annoys me. 
I would definitely eat their food again, though I would probably order takeout."}
{"text":"Pros- chicken Parmesan is delicious, bread and butter is awesome, fan of their citrus/ buttery risotto yummmm, large portions you can save for lunch, friendly staff, cod melted I my mouth

Cons- unorganized/slow service in the beginning we waited for almost 5+ minutes before anyone offered us drinks, Italian dressing was unappetizing (too much oil or something), sort of pricy though you get large portions, restaurant seems stuffy and depressed - just kind of dark and dirty feeling. 

Overall, food was pretty good, restaurant needs to freshen up its decor so it feels more comfortable and inviting, staff was friendly, but service was spotty in the beginning."}
{"text":"Food and service was outstanding. Went the day after Valentines day and it was busy yet our server was on top of everything. The girlfriend had the salmon and I had the sea food pasts. Both were amazing and I am a seafood snob. The only fault was the bread they give you wasn't warm, but that is being super picky. The garlic butter for the bread was wonderful. Overall I know we will go once a month."}
{"text":"This is one of mine and my wife's favorite go-to restaurants when we would like to just have a last minute night out.  The food is always great and very reasonably priced.  I have never been disappointed by their daily specials and love their poppy seed dressing.  Many times you feel a bit rushed between the time they bring your salad and main dish but we have never truly felt rushed as we have been last people in the place on occasion.  The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.   I hear they have a nice happy hour but have yet to try it out.  They do not take reservations but do accept \"call ahead\" notices."}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's Day. Portion size was great. Food was great. Service was great. I do think they put a little too much salad dressing on the salads. Other than that everything was awesome."}
{"text":"This review is based soley on their party room. This is my Aunt's go to restaurant for all of her larger dinner parties or private room events. The party room is definitely cozy, but it's also inviting and warm. Plenty of room for 50 of your closest friends and family to join you in celebration. 

The staff has always been great, even when sometimes I don't know how they do it. The portions aren't huge, but I think that's a smart way of avoiding those tacky take out boxes. I know I alway enjoy my meal, only thing I didn't care for was their roast beef. A common package would include soda, bread, salad, choice of 3 entrees (fish, chicken or beef) and we would bring in our own desserts and cake.

I would definitely recommend this place for large groups!"}
{"text":"J Bella is one of the better restaurants in Strongsville; certainly top 3.  My wife likes the spinach and goat cheese salad and loves the basil vinaigrette salad dressing. I am a big fan of the chop salad and also the pappardelle alla vodka. Their chicken Marsala is also very good. The service is usually good and there is usually a decent crowd so I know we are not the only people that like this place.  My kids like it too and don't have a problem finding something on the menu they will eat."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing every time!  We used to go for dinner quite often, now that we have a child we go less frequently but still manage to get there often enough.  For food, my hubby always gets the cavatelli.  For me, it's the chicken Parmesan - it is the BEST I have ever had.  It is enough to take half home and makes a delicious lunch the next day.  The salad to start is very good, and the bread with the garlic butter is outstanding!  The only con I would say is the old style dark maroon textured paint on the wall, it's very early 90's color if you ask me. 
If you can get past the decor, you will not be disappointed with the food!  Also I saw some negatives on service, I have always had great service so I would have to disagree there.

Omg I almost forgot...when not in the mood for pasta I get the spinach and goat cheese salad. If is soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"After having an enjoyable dinner here the week before, I attended a bridal shower in their party room this past weekend.  The acoustics in the room were terrible, and the brunch buffet was nothing special.....eggs, potatoes, sausage (yucky), bacon, French toast, some danish/desserts, and fruit salad.  When I found out how much it cost per person, I was appalled!  For three more dollars, you can go to the 100th Bomb Group and eat like a king!  Don't waste your time or money booking this room for your special event!!!"}
{"text":"got a bite to eat Friday night, sat at the bar, ewww why does it have to smell like some one just threw up in the corner by the hostess stand behind the bar, you got a serious problem there.  Salad was good, bar maid seemed miserable."}
{"text":"Been awhile since last ate here. Went there tpnight as aparty of 4 and did not wait for atanle at 5:30 pm. Prices seemed higher than i recalled. It was a busy Saturday night, and noise level made it difficult to converse at our table. Service was timely and efficient. Food was plenty hot but taste was just average. Probably be a good while before I go back!"}
{"text":"Love JBella usually. Had the unfortunate experience of being seated next to the bussing area which is right in the dining area.  Definitely needs to be moved or not have a table there. We looked at waiters and waitresses banging dirty dishes during our entire meal. Literally less than two feet from our table. My husband kept having to move out of the way. At least the young bus boys were more courteous and tried very hard not to clank the dishes too loud. While the food is good I could not wait to leave!"}
{"text":"This place is literally am amazing! The jumbo shrimp scampi with angel hair is my personal favorite! The service is always awesome too. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My son took me out for my birthday and I had not been here in a while and was not disappoint . Salad was crisp and Eggplant pram was deli sous . Had a side of past I could not eat as the eggplant was a high portion as was my sons Chicken Parm . I thought they would ask if we wanted a birthday dessert as a lit of restaurants do (including Pier W) miss the eggplant Rollups as they were superb !!"}
{"text":"I loved their scalloped potatoes, the veal, and their antipasto. Service was pretty good and the restaurant had a nice aesthetic."}
{"text":"We've been coming to J Bella for many years. If you're looking for a great place for Happy Hour pricing with excellent selections fairly priced ...or in the mood for seafood , the Walleye ..or Grouper are superb and portions are GENEROUS but you'll have to call ahead as these two are served as specials on certain days . The regular dinner menu also has a very fair portion of cod or salmon, the red sauce here is one of the best I've had also. Awesome salads and plenty of other selections. Consistent large portions delicious and fairly priced."}
{"text":"As a 100% Italian I have never had a better italian meal then at jbella, tasted just like grandmas cooking. The best chicken Parm I have ever had ( don't tell grandma) and the cavitelli is even better. 6 stars of it was possible"}
{"text":"Had Avery good experience here!  The staff are great. Would defiantly come back again."}
{"text":"We went to JBella for their happy hour. Hours are 4p until 7p. We arrived right at 4 and within 20 minutes it was full. I will admit that it was primarily seniors but also a mix of work people. The HH menu is limited but certainly has something for everyone. Our table enjoyed a pizza, pasta, sausage stuffed peppers and a wrap. We also had their small salad. Service was fine, drinks were great, portions were more than adequate and our bill for two was very reasonable. This isn't our first visit and it certainly won't be our last!"}
{"text":"I don't think there is a restaurant as good as this one with in 20 miles.  That  includes all restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was OK but the service was terrible.  I went here with an other couple things started bad and never got better.  The place was moderately busy but no line to get in.
When we were seated our menus were covered in tomato sauce.  When our soft drinks arrived they were wrong.  We ordered the Brushetta, which was very good!  The salads came next and they were also good.  When the entrees came, no one took our plate from the appetizer or salads.  So as we struggled shuffling plates around this small table.  We finely got settled to eat, when the waitress came around to check on us.  She said she would get us more bread and refill our drinks. She didn't offered to bring us Parmesan Cheese for our Meals.  When she brought our drinks she disappeared and we didn't see her for about 20 minutes (No bread).  When she brought us our check she kept getting it wrong.  She had to change the check three times.  Over all not that great!  Prices are a little high, food is average and service is bad."}
{"text":"2 stars for great pasta. Utterly atrocious service. Slow, inattentive, and disengaged at different times. It was busy, so we would have tolerated slow service but tossing the food and drinks on the table, forgetting drinks and utensils and not bringing things when asked was unforgivable. Mushy looking avocado on top of salad but rest was ok. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"We had my parent's 40th anniversary brunch in their dining room, as the party room was already reserved. I can't say enough positive things about the entire experience. From the friendly, attentive service for our party of over 40 people, the delicious breakfast food (go with the French toast option!), and their attention to detail...our party was a success thanks to J. Bella, and we didn't have to worry about a thing. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of 10 friends on a Saturday night around 5pm. The place was doing well, fairly busy. It was nice inside - clean, what was expected.
I enjoyed a Sam Adams fall beer (Oktoberfest?), which was good. They disappointed me by having no pumpkin beer.
Started us off with bread'n'butter, which was quite nice - crispy crust and very soft on the inside. 
I ordered the Lasagna, which is a meal I'm picky about - I love lasagna so am easily disappointed. This lasagna was solid. I quite enjoyed it. I believe I also ordered a side salad, but don't remember. If I did, it was probably good (I am also easily disappointed with side salads that are basically a hand full of spring mix and would defintiely remember to complain about it.)
Overall, nice place and totally appropriate quality-wise for the price. It were less expensive, would've given it 4 stars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in and sat at the bar for some drinks and an appetizer.  I was greeted by a woman behind the bar with no smile.  She had the worst attitude!  The service was terrible.  After a long wait for our food, I had to actually get up, walk over to our server who was in the other corner talking to another worker, to ask her to get our food.  She retreived it from the kitchen immediately, meaning it was sitting back there getting cold.  I used to be a server and I always tip well because I know what a hard job it is to serve, but this time she was so bad I left nothing!  I will never go back there."}
{"text":"This place is great! I went on a Wednesday night with my mom and aunt for our usual monthly dinner out. The service was ok... Nothing special, but I am giving it 5 stars because of the food. Overall everything we had was really tasty and very well prepared. We went during happy hour and ordered an app that could have been a meal. They were Italian sliders with fries that were very filling little sandwiches. We ordered 2 meals between my mother and 1 and basically took an entire meal home. The pappardelle alla vodka was amazing! I would order it every time I go there. The lasagna was also amazing and big enough to feed 3 people. The prices are a little high, but you get what you pay for! This is our new Italian spot."}
{"text":"We have been here before and the food was so much better. This time the food was so awful that we won't be coming back again. their landmark dishes, were horrible. They tasted like they had been sitting around in the kitchen for a while as they were lukewarm and a bit soggy (and not very tasty). I also had a salad and the lettuce was tired, the dressing and chicken had no taste -and the waiter never came by so that we could have possibly tried something different. The meal was expensive and a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Waitress #1 apparently  forgot to put our order in.Waitress #2 graciously  took over,but was an hour wait for our food.Capresse chicken was dry and bland.Shrimp special was just that, rubbery. Not feeling the love  for that place."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. The Chicken Marsala needed tons of salt but the chicken was tender. The service could have been better. I know that they have tons of better servers but we got the most timid one. We had a few bottles of wine and we consistently had to pour our own glasses. At the price of this restaurant we should not have had to do this."}
{"text":"We never thought we'd get in on a Friday night during the holidays, but the hostesses did their best to keep our wait to a minimum. We ordered the basics...Mussels, pasta meat sauce, a pasta vodka and strawberry salads. The servings were huge!  Each meal was super tasty- a couple of the best sauces I've had.  Thrilled to find this nugget right in our back yard.  To top it off, great service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dine here often and have never had a bad meal! The Chicken Parmesan may seem boring to foodies, but it's legendary and amazing. Had a fantastic Seafood Alfredo dish here as well. I have no problem recommend in and would go here for great Italian anytime!!"}
{"text":"Good Italian food!  Try the cavateli, it's one of the better ones I've  had.  Has a seperate room for private events.  The whole family easily agrees to go here for dinner because it has menu items everyone likes- even with one kid being a picky eater.  Like I said, it's  good Italian food."}
{"text":"I saw on TV they have been making this to-die-for pasta dish for decades. The secret to their sauce they say is it's simmered in neck bones. The secret to their pasta, a fuscilli like thing, is handmade daily.

We arrived early Sunday afternoon around 3:30pm. It's a plain looking storefront in a quiet strip mall with a huge parking lot. So nothing cute or quaint about the outside.

It gets better on the inside. A much warmer feeling is evoked with dim lighting, dark woody trim/stucco walls and white tablecloth, albeit 1980's, is the look in the dining room.

We get seated near a window by Heather, a long time server here. Room and table is comfy. There are 2 other tables with couples and what looked like a wedding shower in a private room in the front.

We all scan the menu and I see the famous pasta dish so definitely getting that. But then I always hedge my bet with something else because plain pasta dishes more times than not, never deliver even with Iron Chef hype. The back-up dish today is chicken marsala. The family got a lasagna, a Chilean sea bass, and a seafood risotto.      

All entrees come with a homemade soup or a salad. Heather steered us towards the salad because it's loaded with fruit, berries, nuts, and a tasty dressing. Almost a meal in itself. So we got both and split it - 2 Italian wedding soups and 2 salads.

The verdict - Soups and salads were outstanding. Pasta dish was meh or its subtle virtues were over my head. The chicken marsala was delish, the no brainer back-up. I tasted the other dishes and they were above average.

We ended with 2 cannoli, which were made in-house and excellent."}
{"text":"Having been to quite a few Italian restaurants in my eating adventures, this has been a very mediocre experience at best. 

I went on a Wednesday evening at 5:30 with a group of friends. 

**Happy Hour**
The \"Happy Hour\" isn't very happy nor is the selection. $6 margaritas and mojitos is not really a deal at all. The Mojito I had was like lemonade with a splash of alcohol. 

The \"appetizer\" options weren't really appetizers, granted they listed them as \"small plates\". 

**Appetizer**
We opted to try the Arancini balls, they weren't very good, I've had better from the frozen food section. 

**Entree**
Pork Osso Bucco was not what I expected, but hey, it's not a beef shank with that lovely marrow one would dream of. The best part of the plate were the mashed potatoes. 

The pork was tender, but it's only saving grace was the beef demi sauce, it was not from the pork reduction. The sauce tasted more of a bagged beef gravy than a true pan demi glacé. 

**Service**
The waitress was very discombobulated and didn't ask to refill my water once. She didn't advise me there was a $1 charge extra for the blue cheese dressing on my salad either. 

The icing on the cake was when she \"lost\" my credit card. She finally found it after 10 minutes of retracing her steps, but still she misplaced my card in the first place. 

**Overall Impression**
I \"might\" give this place another chance, since my friends seemed to enjoy their food. The lasagna I was able to see across the table, smelled great and looked the part too. 

I hope they head my review and fix their \"happy hour\" menu. Maybe I am too picky, but it truly didn't feel like a happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Just came back from the 4-7 pm Happy Hour at JBella. It was wonderful. I had the Garlic Shrimp Bella over angel hair pasta for $6.00. It was a nice size portion and very tasty. Size wise it was enough for me, but my husband would have needed a little more if that was his only item. It definitely had a lot of garlic and butter, but it was so...so....good. We also had wine and stuffed mushrooms both at happy hour prices. Wine selection is good and the pour is generous. We ordered a regular dinner salad which gave us bread with our meal. Happy hour entrees do not include bread. So with three glasses of wine, an order of stuffed mushroom, one dinner salad, bread and a plate of Garlic Shrimp Bella the bill was still under $30.00 and it was delicious and filling. Can't beat that for two people. 

The atmosphere is Italian, Tuscan style and it is a step up from a strip mall or neighbor bar. Most of the people at the bar were in business dress. It does get busy during happy hour so you need to come early if you want to sit at the bar. They also let you sit at the tables in the bar area and still get happy hour prices. The staff was fun and easy to talk with. They were kind enough to create a space for us at the bar by adding an extra chair. The food came extremely quickly and it was piping hot. All in all it was an enjoyable evening with good food and good company in an pleasant atmosphere. Can't beat that!!! The regular menu seems to be a little high in cost but it has a lot of unique as well as standard Italian cuisine. My review only reflects my happy hour experience at JBella."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, & service is wonderful!!! It costs a little more but is very well worth it!"}
{"text":"I went to J Bella's for dinner and perhaps the best part about the experience was the service. The food was very good also! Our waiter was very attentive by constantly filling our glasses when necessary, bringing the courses in an orderly fashion and checking in on our table. Before dinner came, they brought warm bread and garlic butter. I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and It was delicious. The portions were huge and there was a really good amount of salad toppings such as strawberries, pecans, and goat cheese. They had a very large wine selection that I would really like to come back and try."}
{"text":"Glad I finally got to try Bucci's J Bella, after being a fan of Bucci's in Berea 30 years ago.  Food was good, large/varied selection, casual dining atmosphere, nice wine selection.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was just one big room with an exposed ceiling; a partial wall divided the bar area from the dining room. This design plus a big crowd made it pretty noisy at 5:30p on a Wednesday. Regardless, the decor was very homey. Many lanterns hung from the ceiling and the walls were painted a warm red and creamy yellow. Grape vines hung over some of the bar tables. There was also a large covered patio space. 

I ordered the chicken fingers for an appetizer. They were strips with lots of white meat and a nicely flavored breadcrumb mix. For my main I got the meat ravioli, which like most of the entrees came with a side salad. The salad was simple - classic - but good. The eight ravioli I was served tasted as if they were followed a familiar sauce recipe. The flavor was good though and I'd recommend this dish for both kids or a not super hungry adult. 

And just an innocent observation. I think 45 may have been the minimum age aside from myself. 65 the average."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian food I have ever had. I had the prime rib, fantastic. My boyfriend had the chicken Parmesan and wow, that was the best thing I have ever tasted. Portion sizes are HUGE. Bread is fresh and warm. Can't get enough of this restaurant. I wish we had one out by me. Love it."}
