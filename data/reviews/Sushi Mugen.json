{"text":"long time fan of Sushi Marche that closed and re-opened as Sushi Mugen , different owners. to be expected some growing pains but have stuck with them at least once per month, take out.   They are now better than Sushi Marche, the order is always on time when they say it will be as well!  So happy they took over the business.   Have to try the Poke bowl as recently described by others here!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by on my lunch break with some co-workers. I have never been here before, but I heard good things. - And those good things were right! It's a nice small sushi place with a great set of staff members. Very kind and helpful when ordering. I ordered one of their specials, the pokebowl, with raw salmon and it was very delicious! I recommend it with avocado!"}
{"text":"I've been on a poke fix lately, so when my coworkers told us a shop close to work started serving it, I jumped at the chance to join them.   Like most shops on Queen East, the shop is small. A very mom and pop, family feel. We went during lunch, and it was quiet for a Friday afternoon.  I got the butterfish poke bowl. It came with butterfish, cucumber, rice and taro chips. The ingredients were fresh, but the toppings lacked.  For the price I would have paid at other shops, the portion size was small, and the \"included\" options were very limited. You could get more toppings, but I have a hard time paying close to $15 for lunch and leaving hungry.   Probably won't come here for poke again, but their sushi menu did look decent."}
{"text":"I recently ordered delivery from Sushi Mugen. While it can be a bit more expensive than its neighbouring sushi spot, the quality is much better. Service is delightful. Salad comes with creamy sesame dressing! And the driver is an honest person who bypasses the tip option on the machine because the delivery charge is prepaid -- I've never experienced that before. Anyway eat their sushi, tip the driver, and good things will happen."}
{"text":"We've been to Sushi Mugen after the place was renovated, and the maki rolls we're ok. We only went to try a second time because we found out that they offer poke bowl. For those who's interested, poke is pretty much a Hawaiian take on chirashi - both amazing in its own way!  We opted for ahi tuna poke bowl, and you can add avocado or other items at an additional $1. You can choose from 4-6 different type of sauce to go with your poke. We just went with the traditional poke that they offered, and it was amazingly delicious. My husband is now addicted and a fan of poke! The ahi tuna was fresh, and the sauce was done well. Everything in the poke bowl was well balanced.   As for the maki dinner set we got was fine, fish was fresh, but we wish the seaweed was dryer and crispier. Overall we'd be back for the poke for sure!!  Ps: they serve you miso after you've ordered your food at the cashier."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and decided to check this place out for dinner as I was craving sushi. I got the Sushi Dinner that came with miso soup, salad, 8 pieces of California roll and 6 pieces of assorted nigiri. It wasn't the best sushi I've ever had but it was still tasty, fresh, and was good for the price point at $17.95."}
