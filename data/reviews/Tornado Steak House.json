{"text":"Easily, my favorite bar in Madison. The drinks are well-concocted, thoughtful, and pack a punch. Courteous and attentive waitstaff. Drinks are $2 off Sun-Thurs after 10. The food is also great but, to be honest, I come for the crowded, dimly lit nooks that bring to mind a classic mid-century supper club. To share a drink in the right atmosphere with the right people is always a good night."}
{"text":"My first experience at Tornado was quite good.  My date and I hadn't made a reservation, and when we talked to the host he said there was a 1.5 hour wait, but if a table in the bar was open, we could grab it. Sounded good to us, since there was an open one!  Bar tables are REALLY limited on leg room and actual surface area on the table, but we made it work. You could probably fit six people on the booths, but there might be enough room for half of their legs and 1.5 entrees on the table.  That being said, they make a pretty decent brandy old fashioned. My date ordered *cringe* a can of PBR, which he said was warm. I was pretty sure that's how most people drink that particular beverage anyway...  My date REALLY wanted the frog legs and tried to convince the waitress I'd eat some too. Having had certain experiences with frogs in my life, I did not try them, but they actually smelled garlicky and delicious. They arrived breaded, fried, and nested on a sort of sweet and sour sauce. He devoured the whole plate, I watched in fascination.  The server brought us some warm, dilly bread, which was quite tasty. We stashed it on the booth seat next to us for lack of table space.  Then... The entrees... My beau ordered the rabbit (clearly a fan of jumping foods) which felt sort of small in portion size. Still, it was deliciously breaded and pan fried. Cooked perfectly and nicely tender. My steak arrived sizzling on a metal plate with a giant onion ring on top. It was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. The hash browns on the side were also pretty good, though not he best I've had at a steakhouse. Pretty sure  they are freshly made though.   I'll definitely go back, but I'd like to sit at a real table. I guess that means that next time, I'll make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of steak at a lot of places and this was easily the best steak I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly, had great flavor (without any garnish), and was a great amount of food. The service was also very quick, professional, and upbeat. Definitely my favorite steak place thus far."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! They have great food and it has a really family atmosphere yet classy. They have great steaks and the food is always great! It has an old rustic feel and the decorations look like it is an old dinner club. If you are in Madison and looking for a real Madison restaurant this is the place to go."}
{"text":"It's a steak joint of the old school.   The music is strictly loungey, the bar is dark and kind of cramped, the lighting is low, the portions are big and the steak is excellent. It's one of the finer steaks you can get in town; well-aged, well-seasoned, cooked perfectly, and they have a very complete menu of beefy goodness. Their non-steak entrees are respectable, but not really the star of the show. They serve a signature, monstrous 20oz bone-in tenderloin that is delicious, expensive, and unless you've prepped for a few days, nearly impossible to finish. My usual 8oz fillet is, with sides and bread, usually enough to fill me up (and I occasionally border on gluttony).   The vibe is strictly supper-club - white tablecloths, raw vegetables on the table, wood panelling, rustic hunting-lodge decor, slightly wobbly chairs, martinis aplenty and straight-up steakhouse food. The sides are the same sort of unpretentious, classic American fare - your choice of spinach salad, green salad, casear salad, or iceberg wedge with roquefort, and your steak comes with potato or vegetable. That's where it kind of breaks down a bit - the vegetables aren't their strong suit (usually just steamed green beans, broccoli, or asparagus), and the potatoes range from fantastic to kind of bland. Hash browns are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, but sometimes are a bit greasy for a lot of palates. The steak fries are excellent - big, crispy and fluffy, and piled high. Baked potatoes are none-too interesting. The food is, however ,consist ant. You can pretty much be guaranteed the same thing each time you go there. Unlike many of the other steakhouses I've experienced, it's been almost ludicrously stable - what's good is always reliably good, and what's weak has always been weak. They have a plan and a menu and they're sticking to it.   Service is usually quite good, although during peak times they often seem a little more harried than I'd expect from a place with this much history behind it. It gets crowded quickly on a weekend, and the waiting area is somewhat odd and uncomfortable - clearly it's preferred that you wait in the bar and spend some cash on their (admittedly excellent) mixed drinks.   It's not tremendously expensive, but it isn't cheap either. A standard dinner for a table of two can run $75 with a drink. Not quite as high as some of the fine-dining establishments in town, but not generally a bill to be taken lightly.   It also helsp to make reservations well in advance, as the long serving times and large quantites make this place the kind that fills up fast and doesn't do a lot of quick turnover."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for an early Valentine's Day dinner. We decided to come here instead of Ruth's Chris. This was a great choice.  We both ordered drinks which were generous and strong, well worth the $9 price tag. We ordered escargot for an appetizer which was amazing. We used our bread to sop up the garlic butter sauce/left over juices on the platter. My husband choose the caesar salad (he said it was pretty good) while I had the warm bacon spinach salad (delicious!).  Our entrees were the 32 oz rib-eye for my husband and the filet au poive (grass fed, organic beef). Both were some of the best steaks we'd ever had. They were cooked perfectly and well flavored.  The side we chose was the market vegetable which was sauteed greens--delicious!  Our waitress was wonderful and patient. The dining room was quiet, and it was perfect for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try after reading good reviews about it from different websites. I hate to admit that everything here were overrated. I was only here once and my review may not be the most accurate out there. I would love to give this place a second chance, but given the price and my first experience, maybe not in few years. For appetizer, I had the escargot. It was okay but not very special. I've had better for cheaper price. I also had the caesar salad, and it was also just okay (but then, I don't have high expectations from the salad). Finally, for main entree, I ordered a T-bone steak and shared it with my husband. The steak, which was supposed to be the highlight of the night, was dissapointing. I asked for a medium well one, and it was burned and dry. I have been eating medium-well steak all my life, and it's not an impossible requests especially in good steak restaurants. I am not sure if they were busy that night or they grilled it for too long, but for a $30-40ish dollar steak, it was wayyy overrated.  I felt bitter for the rest of the night, mostly because I consumed too much carbon and because I had to pay a lot of money for that."}
{"text":"I come from a family of chefs and Tornado is always our choice for a dinner out in Madison.  I vary between the beef tenderloin and the lamb (only place I will order lamb).  This is one of the few places left in Madison where you get sides with your entrees, and the wedge and hashbrowns cannot be beat.  Drinks are great.  Service is usually really good. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Went here with the mother in law last night for dinner.  Table of 3.  Got there around 6:20.  Immediate seating for a Thursday.  FAR better than when I went to Fleming's in Midvale about 15 minutes prior, who absolutely would not seat us as we didn't have reservations, even though there were 5 waiters standing there doing nothing near the waiter station.... grrr....  Anyways, The Tornado was great.  I had been there once before with the wifey a few years ago and felt it was above average then, but last night the food seemed much better than I remembered.  Shrimp Cocktail was standard, nothing special, but MIL likes it so we got it.    French Onion Soup above average.  Good heft to the broth.  The two other salads looked good.  I ordered the Bone in Ribeye, which is my favorite steak due to the marbling.  Medium rare.  Cooked pretty well.  Very good flavor to the steak, perfect crusting and great texture.  A very very very good steak.  Probably a five star steak honestly.  Wife and MIL liked their filets as well.  I think the steak prices are 30-48$.  Dessert was a chocolate/caramel contraption, which I didn't really partake in but everyone else seemed to love it.  Total price ~ $150 without tip.  Very well done restaurant.  Service was grea"}
{"text":"The food there was okay. I had a salmon dish there. I don't eat beef so I can speak for their steak."}
{"text":"Pros:  Good food- had the lamb and it was amazing. The bread is also pretty great. Nice ambiance- we sat outside and it was pretty Good cocktails and overall drink selection- I had this odd cucumber cocktail that was interesting and delicious Price was right- for a good steakhouse, the cost was exactly what I would expect. Seemed to be very busy- we went on a Wednesday night without reservations and the wait was an hour if you wanted to sit inside. A good sign!  Cons:  The service was pretty poor- our server was so quiet and mumbled so badly that I could barely understand him. The first time he came up I didn't even realize he was talking. Maybe he was recovering from laryngitis or something but a heads up would have been nice if that were the case. He also forgot to bring us silverware twice. Other than that people were polite and timely.  Bottom line: I will be back for the late night menu! We went during regular hours so I'm excited to try deliciousness at half the price. I would also rate this place 4.5 if I could"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here! Tonight we had the pork tenderloin and their 10 oz. grass-fed tenderloin au poivre. Delicious! The steak was cooked perfectly and the pork came with a great tart cherry sauce. Our service was great, attentive but not intrusive. This time we had no room for dessert, but if given the chance I would have had their creme caramel.  Love the wood paneling and saws that line the walls, this place is perfect for enjoying a great steak and hash browns.   This is our favorite place to eat out in Madison!"}
{"text":"For the last six weeks we have been doing a project for the Governor's Office at State of Wisconsin Administration and living at the Inn on the Park. We hope to be here for the next six months.  I am aware that your restaurant has earned a lot of laurels in Madison and we have been regular customers at your restaurant enjoying the quality of food and the ambience of your restaurant. Tonight however, we were planning on coming to your restaurant for dinner again but before we did we were sitting at the bar at Inn on the Park and wanted one of our team mates to try your Oysters. I walked across the street in to your restaurant and asked for a dozen Oysters to go. I was rudely told by a bearded waiter that you were \"Not a to Go shop. We do not even have To Go Boxes\".  I have been to the best restaurants all over the country and nobody refuses to box my order if I so desire and pay the price. Maybe I just looked like a looser to your waiter so I asked for a Manager as I did not believe this was the restaurant  's policy.  A young girl came out and told me that she was the Manager and repeated exactly the same thing as your bearded bar tender. As I intended to complain I asked for her name and business card but she claimed she had neither. She did not even have a name tag.  I am aware that you are a very successful restaurant and do not need our business but a little courtesy and respect for your clientele would be nice. I hail from Dallas, Texas and a server  like that would have been fired immediately. We will avoid your restaurant in the future since we are obviously not good enough to order food  there, but I do hope you realize that this is not the way your staff should be treating potential customers. Thank you,   Bruce Phillipowsky 214.436.2672"}
{"text":"This steakhouse was well worth the three block trek from my hotel through knee deep snow. The bar has a relaxed 'low lighting' retro vibe and the dining area is predominantly laquered dark wood wainscoting with a mix of tables and booths in an exposed beam construction décor that kinda feels like a cross between an older hunting lodge and a Swiss ski chalet, decorated with a mix of classic wall mountings (I recall an old woodsman's axe and a muzzle loader amongst the animal heads). Also, there are a few classic 'pearls of wisdom' written on the horizontal beams in the rafters.  The winelist doesn't compare to what you'd find in California, but the cocktail list is a good mix of fancy 'chick drinks' and twists on old school classics. The bartenders in this place actually know how to make a good cocktail!  I had the bartender turn the \"Casino Royale\" into a passable \"Vesper\" with just a little tweaking.  Specialty appetizer breads, veggies and dipping spreads were also a nice touch.  Having had a steak the night before, I opted for the duck breast. I ordered it med rare and it arrived cooked exactly as requested. The port wine currant reduction was sweet and tart at the same time, perfectly off-setting the fattiness of the duck. While the main dish was perfect, the sides were somewhat bland and overcooked and required taking a little salt and pepper and the bread spreads to 'liven' them up. Although, this is not unexpected with a baked potato and steamed veggies. I was also pleasantly surprised to see they periodically offered frog legs and rabbit on the menu. In addition, they  had a scaled back late evening (after 10PM) menu for the night owls.  Service was fast and friendly. The only hiccup of the evening was when I asked for asparagus as a side and got a baked potato instead. When I mentioned the oversight to the waitress, she politely apologized and brought the asparagus a few minutes later, with no addition to the tab.   Considering the top notch quality of the meal and accompanying cocktail, the price was very reasonable. I overtipped 30% for the good service and still paid less than $40. This is a much better bargain than you would get in almost any other major metropolitan area in the USA.  If I ever make it back out to Madison for business again, my first dinner back will be at Tornado Steak House."}
{"text":"Was told good things about this restaurant so we decided to try it while we were in town. The atmosphere was good. Service was good too. The food though was not good. I ordered the lamb chops and my friend ordered the filet. The lamb chops were okay. It's not that they didn't cook them well, it's just that the preparation was bad. The sauce that they came out in overpowered the meat. Each bite was a bit harder then the last. My friend said the steak had no flavor and was tough. With a good filet, you should be able to cut it with a fork. She said she needed to put effort in with the knife.   Overall everything was okay. Why I give this restaurant a low review is because for how much everything costs we should have been amazed by the food. We were not. If you're in town looking for a good steak, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"As you would expect, this place has great steak.  I also like the ambiance, wine and cocktails.  I've had mixed luck with the bread offering and the sides.  Sometimes they are good, sometimes not so good.  The steak and fun old school setting keep us coming back though."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying this steak house for a year; however, I won't be returning.  First, we were seated at a 2 top table near the entry of the room.  No table should be placed here, so servers and diners kept nearly running us over.  It made for many disruptions.    The really upsetting factor was the service.  We waited for 20 minutes to receive our beverages.  We waited another 20 minutes to receive the soup course.  The same occurred with the entrees.  There were never apologies from the server.    My husband and I ordered the filets prepared medium.  Mine was well done, and his was medium - well to well done.  Since I had learned they moved so slowly there, I just forced it down.  It was very tough.  I also had an order of steak fries.  I'm convinced they were the pre-frozen Ore-Ida kind.  They were burnt and had absolutely no seasoning, not even salt.  I have digestive issues, so they would have been hard for me to digest.  I explained this to the server and asked for a batch that wasn't quite over-cooked.  She came back 20 minutes later with an identical set and said that if they cooked them any less the would be too cold in the middle.  This reinforced my belief they were frozen.  I make steak fries at home all the time, and you can do so without making them burnt to a crisp if they are actually fresh cut.  With the price of the meal, they should use fresh-cut fries.  My husband isn't picky at all, but even he said there was no point in wasting the calories to eat them because they were bland and too hard.  When the check arrived I was shocked she had charged me for the steak fries, even after I communicated I probably wouldn't be able to eat the new batch either.  Also, I had ordered lemonade and realized that for my  2 lemonades ( I ordered a refill), I was charged $2 per lemonade.  I was never told there was not a free refill.  Also, the small glass was 90% ice each time.  My husband was also charged a $1.50 up charge for ordering french onion soup even though the menu said that all entrees come with  \"choice of soup or salad & vegetable.\"  When he pointed this out, the server did take it off the bill for us, but confirmed they do charge an up-charge.  She didn't explain why that wasn't on the menu.  We will not be returning.  We get much better service at Flemings for the same price.  I had high expectations for this old time supper club that is locally owned, but I was sadly disappointed.  It put a damper on our Valentine's Day celebration..."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of old school elegance and charm (I am) this is the place to go. Romantic booth seating, dim lighting, background jazz.  Go late night after 10pm and it is $10 for a steak sandwich which is a great deal.  Half off bottles of wine on Sunday."}
{"text":"I have to chime in after my first experience and reading the mixed reviews and agree with almost everything said.  The prime rib I ordered was very lacking both in actual temperature as well as flavor.  You may ask why I did not ask my server to have it warmed up and that comes from her lack of attentiveness to the table.  With that stated my girlfriend who is not a steak person absolutely loved her filet.  The french onion soup was the highlight of the meal.   With that stated about 10 minutes after leaving our downtown hotel we realized we forgot our leftovers.  We were just on the other side of the capital building and did not go back to retrieve them which means there is something to be said about the quality of the food.  I don't honestly see myself giving Tornado a second chance."}
{"text":"The late night atmosphere is quite eclectic and funky but they're always playing some old soul (Sam Cooke, Al Green) so I feel right at home.   The late night menu is quite delicious with the burgers being some of the best I've ever had in Madison, hands down. The funny thing is, we haven't been in for a proper dinner yet, but we plan on it soon."}
{"text":"I have been a patron at this establishment for the last several years and had always had good experiences until recently. After being treated disrespectfully by their dinner host, I promised that I would tell everyone I knew about how terribly we were treated. So here's me following through with my promise.   Last weekend a friend and I intentionally waited to dine so that we could partake of Tornado Room's late-night menu. Upon arrival we asked a waitress about seating. Looking flustered, she told us it was first-come-first-served. We saw an empty table in the small side room where others were eating & drinking and took our seats. Immediately another waitress told us that we couldn't sit there since dinner was still being served in that room. She told us we needed to wait until 10:00PM for the late-night menu to begin. I informed her that it was 10:30PM. She asked us to leave the table and ushered us towards a bald, portly man (\"gentleman\" would be an inappropriate term here). We explained our situation and he said we would need to wait and then disappeared.   In the meantime we watched a group of guys who had arrived at the restaurant after us sit and be served at exactly the same table that we had been asked to leave. Since the host had disappeared, we told another waitress about our frustration, and she redirected us to the host. We explained the situation when he returned only to be met with,\" Lady, I've heard it from you like five times already!\" I was appalled. He continued with a string of ill-mannered nonsense. I suggested that he establish some sort of seating protocol, get his waitstaff on the same page, and then follow said protocol. He told us we could wait a bit longer and eat in the basement. We declined.  My friend and I left and had dinner at Natt Spil, where the waitstaff were kind, thoughtful, and prompt with our most delicious and tasty meal.   No steak sandwich is worth maltreatment."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 25th anniversary at Tornado and it was worth every penny we spent. We ordered the 8 oz. TBone and 8 oz tenderloin. The portion sizes were much bigger than listed and they were done perfect at medium rare. The taste was exquisite and flavorful. The French onion soup was terrific and the wedge salad substantial. We visited on a Tuesday and it was surprisingly busy. I would recommend the Tornado and we will return."}
{"text":"Just reviewing the late night menu/experience...  ...And it is awesome. Especially for Madison where real late night options tend to be sparse and basically mush mush pizza. The steak sandwich is divine with that au jus. Let's be real too especially if you've had a night's worth of New Glarus & Ale Asylum in your gut.   You can get a real drink or just a simple beer here, so it's not particularly exclusive or expensive if don't want it to be.  But if you want to go all out you certainly can throw down for a fattie steak, conspiring in one their intimate booths like a mob boss as if you're discussing how to deal with scabs down at the warf strikes. Or just grab a big table in the back if you're a large group!"}
{"text":"Went for the late night menu in the Corral Bar downstairs.  The place was a little disorganized with a couple bigger groups taking up a lot of the seating but plenty of people were standing around enjoying beverages of their choosing.  The bar itself is very small and had 1 bartender and 1 waiter running food in from upstairs.  Without talking to the bartender it would be hard to tell how to get a table.  I noticed a few people come in and leave in confusion because of this.  Seat yourself and go to the bartender when you want a drink-it's not that difficult folks.  The steak sandwich, salmon sandwich, and cheese curds were all very very good. The brandy old fashioned's were great too.  The bar tender and waiter were working their butts off and the service was excellent.  Going back."}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriend's birthday, and I think it's safe to say we'll never outdo this one. First of all, my James Madison martini was so good, I had to take a picture of the description to see if I could replicate it at home. Secondly, the mushroom soup that they had as soup du jour was delicious and full of whole button mushrooms. And last but not least, the birthday boy ordered the steak au poivre, and said it is the most delicious thing he can ever remember eating. We may just have to come here for all of his birthdays."}
{"text":"While on a weekend trip roadtrip to Spring Green I had dinner here for my birthday. We started with the frog legs which were just ok. Then I had the cauliflower cream soup which was good.  For my main course I had the filet with hash browns. The filet was cooked a perfectly. The hash browns were really good, but be prepared for a peppery kick. We finished with the upside down pinapple cake.  It is servered warm with ice cream on top. Yummy!  Don't leave without having the cake."}
{"text":"Talk about a midnight snack!   I came to Tornado with a couple friends a few days ago on a seasonably cold night. Walking in, I was greeted by a classy setup and the smell of steak. We sat down in a small booth across the bar and proceeded to order from the late night menu. I ordered a steak sandwich.   For a college student, this is a heaven send! The stake was beautiful and at a more than reasonable price for the quality I was getting ($9.99 for good steak? That's something that can't be beat). It was worth the chilly walk.   So set your alarm to go off at midnight, take a stroll around the capital, and enjoy a great steak session at the Tornado Steak House"}
{"text":"late night servers were really unprofessional. I mean who carries a martini to a table IN THEIR PALM!?   The burger I ordered Medium, came out bright purple and cold inside, I didn't eat it, but the server didn't have the power to take it off my meal... this review was from jan 2012... maybe things have gotten better"}
{"text":"I wish they had negative stars because that's what they deserve!!!!!! worst place i have ever been to. i came with my 7 year old son to celebrate my birthday, my son fell asleep so they kicked us out. \"sorry sir we do not allow sleeping in the restaurant\" what kind of people own this place??????? they should be ashamed of themselves !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best steak in madison hands down, but that's not what makes tornado room great. If you've never been to the tornado room past 10 pm and found your way to the basement for cocktails and the nighttime menu, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Recently went to a dinner for my wife's work. The food was great (8 oz fillet) excellent drinks. The only complaint was the booth we had to seat 4 people which wasn't big enough. The space to sit is constraint"}
{"text":"Normally, I would give Tornado a pretty high review.  Unfortunately, my husband and I were on the fence between Tornado and another favorite restaurant, and tonight I wish we would have went to the other restaurant. My husband's family traveled from Europe to visit us and we figured this was the best place in town to go for a fabulous steak dinner.  While everyone else had a good dinner my medium well steak arrived medium rare.  After sending back, and missing eating my dinner with the family, it arrived again, still medium rare. Instead of sending back for the second time, I had the waiter box so we could make steak and eggs for breakfast tomorrow. Shockingly, we still had to ask for the dinner to be removed from the check, or at least discounted.  After all, I didn't even get to eat my dinner.  We received 25% off of a $40 plate and the waiter insisted he had to \"fight\" for the discount we received.  I'm sorry to say that I am extremely disappointed in the service and food this evening.  Experience is everything and tonight was a disappointing evening to an otherwise exciting family visit.  Next time, we'll go the extra distance for what now is our first choice."}
{"text":"Excellent steak. Been here many times on business dinners. I highly recommend the grass-fed steak with the peppercorn sauce."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it wasn't all that great. My husband and several of his colleagues raved about how great the food is. Kitchen must have had an off night because our food was salty. I had the walleye fish and the sauce on top of it was salty. Everyone in our party commented on how their steak was salty. The bread was good and so were the side veggies but whoever was the cook that night had a heavy hand with the salt on the entrees."}
{"text":"This is only my second review I have ever written! My self and 3 colleagues decided to have dinner around 5 pm. The place was empty. We were told by the manager that we had to lower our voices because he was getting complaints. I said from who? There isn't anyone here. After a few minutes I asked the Manager exactly how loud can we talk? He then said you guys are ok now since more patrons had arrived and he slipped up and said \" I was just being proactive in case some one did complain...??? Really?? Wow!! On top of that, I could have gotten a better steak at Walmart! I would pay just about anything for a good aged steak. But this fatty no flavor steak was a rip off!! Do your self a favor and go to any other steak house but this one."}
{"text":"Amazing Steak and Hash-browns! I went with the 14oz Fillet and I'd get it again, as often as possible :)."}
{"text":"Great restaurant tucked down a side street of the Capitol Square.  If you don't know what you are looking for, you might just pass this place by, but don't.  It's worth every dollar.  Atmosphere inside is cozy and warm, with dim lighting and remarkable wood paneling and detailing.  While the menu is limited, one doesn't go to Tornado without an idea in mind of what they want to eat... meat!  My wife and I shared escargot to start, followed by individual side salads, then the peppercorn filet in a cream and cognac mushroom sauce.  The escargot was better than good, but not great.  The salads, while enjoyable were served on room temperature plates.  For a place with the style of Tornado, I was expecting chilled plates.  The main entree was to die for and one of the best filet's I have had in my life.  On the side I enjoyed a baked potato and Brussels sprouts and my wife ordered the hash browns.  The baked potato had a wonderfully crispy skin and the Brussels sprouts were well prepared, although the amount was a little on the shy side, seeing as it was its own separate side order.  The hash browns were seasoned we'll, and although a unique side, were very pleasing.  Including two drinks from the bar, the shared appetizer, and the two main entrees as discussed, the total bill with tip came out to about $150.00.  Not a bad price for the amount of food and it's quality.  The next time we are in Madison, Tornado, will be on the list of places we eat."}
{"text":"Still the coziest restaurant in Madison.  I used to crave their oysters Rockafeller, but for some reason,  the chef has added bread crumbs to the detriment of the recipe. When I ordered the second plate sans fried crumbs, it still fell short of what  I remembered.  The bread was warm and buttery.  The squash soup was thick and just spicy enough.   The rabbit I ordered elicited a look from the waitress and my table mates. I ordered it without the ears.  The diminutive cutlet tasted not like chicken, but pork chop.  It also came with more fried bread crumbs and dark kale which was probably good for someone who likes roughage that bitter.  The only complaint my friend had about the steak was its enormity.  My other friend, gradually becoming a gourmet chef in his own right,  said the duck was cooked perfectly, but  he might have chosen a different sauce.  He declared the hash browns were done \"right.\""}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying don't make the same mistake that I made:  MAKE A RESERVATION!!  We didn't and the wait was over an hour and a half.  100% my fault.  Our table was a booth in their amazing dining room, a time machine back to the '50's.  Loved it.  I'd rate the food very good, with maybe a few shortcomings because we were there on a very busy Saturday night.  The spinach salad which was supposed to be a comforting warm was lukewarm at best.  And a steakhouse that runs out of baked potatoes?  However, the venison I had as an entree was excellent.  I'll definitely go back to check out their late night menu which was recommended to us by several people in town.  And to try the pineapple upside-down cake!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to go out on this fabulous Tuesday night to celebrate a friend's accomplishment. My friend had just passed one of the biggest tests of his career, where better to celebrate than Late Night Menu at the Tornado Room!  My group of SIX walked in only to be greeted by one of the rudest servers I have ever encountered!  We asked for a table for six and instantly he gave us attitude stating it was not their policy to sit six at a table, and we would have to be seated separately.  My friend who was celebrating asked if there was anyway possible to sit together at the booth. The server named Paul snapped back, \"what do you want me to do?\" For some reason we decided to stay and took our seats.  It took about 5-7 minutes for him to even come drop off menus to our table and when he did he tossed one menu at the table and walked away. I was appalled.  We attempted to call him back before he walked away to ask for drinks and he said, \"First come, first serve.\" We had not even gotten waters and only got 1 menu thrown at us at this point.  We then decided we were going to leave and Paul angrily yelled at us, \"Good I wasn't going to serve you anyway!\". The people sitting at the table across from us literally stopped me to tell me that they come there all the time and Paul is always a very rude server.  Now, in my group of six there were 3 servers from Madison's, another bar on the capitol loop, and 1 server from Brickhouse BBQ all ready and willing to tip at least 25-30% considering we know how hard the service industry can be sometimes. After this I don't know if I will ever return to the Tornado Room. I was so excited for their Late Night Menu considering I had NEVER been here before and wanted to try it, only to have it ruined by Paul! Went to Natt Spil and received much better service... Cannot really compare the food though considering I never had had the experience of trying the Tornado Room... :( Hope this helps and let me know when Paul isn't working!"}
{"text":"We came, we ate steak, we left happy. There's not much more to say about a steakhouse with little pretense. I ordered the 28-oz bone-in ribeye, while others in my party tried the rack of lamb and the 21-oz T-Bone. The rack of lamb was particularly delicious because of the sauce, while the steaks were mostly good.  One note that kept this steakhouse from 5-stars though:  There's a fine-line between a generous cut of steak and a cut that's too large to be flavorful. The 28-oz bone-in ribeye here probably errs on the wrong side of that line. While it's generously salted on both sides and seared nearly perfectly, there's hardly any flavor in the pink center. The result was a spectrum of bites from over to under seasoned.  Because of that one issue, I'd say my experience at Wonder Bar was better."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars. The filet is perfect, cooked perfect, looks perfect. That with hash browns and it's all you need. That and their French onion soup is savory wth the right amount of cheese. We just walked in and ate at the bar. They also have a great drink list, from which is recommend a \"not an old fashioned\". You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Took my husband here to celebrate a big milestone for him at work and we were blown away by just how good the food was! The cocktails were wonderful (we had a Whiskey Tango Foxtrot and a Manhattan) and used quality alcohol. The steaks were perfectly cooked, juicy, astonishingly thick and very well seasoned. By far the best steak we've had in Madison.   The ambiance was wonderful too. Not stuffy at all, but still very classy. Super club style without the kitchiness sometimes found with super club decor. We sat out on the back patio, which is done up nicely with birch and string lighting. Very private, but we still had attentive service -- very polite and professional. I would highly recommend making a reservation though, no matter what time of night you plan on going. We definitely plan on returning to the Tornado the next time we have something to celebrate!"}
{"text":"The cuisine at Tornado satisfies the palette and awakens my senses and their savory scallops solidified my patronage as a regular. Due to my food addiction for the scallops in lite cream sauce, I forgive some of the service hiccups because I enjoy the food so much, but last Friday as I waited for an open table, I was told by the waitress it would be an hour wait, so I waited and waited, even though I had a reservation! As other patrons entered and were seated before me, I began to wonder, was it me then? Why wasnt I being seated? Rather than think too much, I made my way to the bar, where I was happily informed that it was first come first serve, again waiting 10 min, I finally got a table only to be informed it was for two gentlemen! Apparently, it's only first come first serve if you're not hispanic and reservations are honored for a select few. My addiction for their scallops was soured by the proprietor's blatant racism, patrons spend your money someplace else! I sure am! I'm a chef I can recreate the dish! Lexi E."}
{"text":"Simply the best steak in Madison and one of the best I've ever had. Add in a tasty cocktail, some yorkshire pudding and the onion ring on top and you have a perfect meal.   Make sure you save room for the pineapple upside-down cake for dessert. Just writing this review I want to go back tonight."}
{"text":"Tornado is the one of the best steak places I have visited.  The food is outstanding and the atmosphere is spectacular.    The wine list is more than acceptable.  They also have a great late night menu."}
{"text":"Really nice place!  My filet --medium rare -- was delicious!  My husband said his could have used more flavor, but that's his own fault for ordering it medium well!  The asparagus side was a little small, and a bit overcooked.  Baked potato was perfect!  Loved the bread assortment they brought out!  French onion soup was good but think the fresh herb they added overpowered the other flavors.  Nice wine selection--gosh I hate paying quadruple the wine store price, though!  Bring back BYOB!  Nice staff and loved our cozy booth--made the din not so overpowering and we could hear each other without yelling!  Really, really yummy steak, but it should be for $33.00!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for steak in Madison.  It has a dark but casual feel to it. The service has always been amazing when I've gone and the food is wonderful. The steak is so tender you could cut it with a fork and it's never been under/over cooked for me (which is difficult because I like my steak exactly medium).   It's a little pricey but it's quickly becoming my \"go to\" special occasion place."}
{"text":"This place rules. We only had a few of the small plates to share, but the house drinks were great, fairly priced, and the vibe was the best. It felt like we had disappeared into another place in time, off the map.  Highly recommend spending some time here, and I'm looking forward to going back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday night  for a 7:30 dinner. No reservation was necessary, there were people there, but not so many that seating was an issue. I'd probably have had to make reservations for 6pm.   This place is very well-decorated; the ambience is unpretentious but tasteful (as tasteful as a cowboy theme can get, I guess)-- as is the food. The fried frog legs appetizer was, surprisingly, really really good. The batter was crispy and well-spiced, it had some sort of delicious sauce, and the meat was tender. It was my first experience with frog legs and I will say I'm a fan.     As an entree, I got the 16 oz New York steak. It was ridiculously good, but had a few bits of gristle in it -- well-seasoned, cooked perfectly with just enough charring on the outside to give it a nice crunch but tender and juicy inside. How did they do that? I got it with a side of hash browns -- highly recommended, if perhaps a little bit greasy. I was planning on getting dessert but by the end of the steak and hash browns, I was too full.   That's the food and the ambience. The service was good, but our waitress made herself perhaps a little too sparse. I'm teetering on the edge of giving this place five stars, but because yelp doesn't allow half-stars, I have to err on the conservative side."}
{"text":"We went to Tornado for a celebratory dinner. Started off with Old Fashioneds as recommended by others, and they were indeed awesome. For an app we ordered the raw oysters - didn't know you could get that quality in the Midwest (sunset beach oysters that day). We made a wise choice and split the 28 oz rib eye - omg it was beautiful, perfect medium rare, and delicious. To top it off, both wines that we ordered were in the 45-65/bottle range but were some of the best we've ever had. Great service, food & experience."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Been going here for years and they consistently have the best steaks, hash browns and top notch service. Classic steakhouse atmosphere right off the square. Love it."}
{"text":"Great steak; great wine; great dessert. Great post-Badger game experience! Waiter said they haven't had an open table since Wednesday, so make sure you have a reservation."}
{"text":"This place is so cool I can barely stand it.  The swanky art deco interior...it's like Frank Sinatra & the entire Brat Pack are sitting in the corner booth.  OMG, frog legs? It makes me wanna say like \"ribbit ribbit!\"."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this place for it's late night menu (10PM - close) and drinks, I've never come for dinner.  The late night menu is AWESOME.  Best \"drunk food\" you will ever eat - and it's cheap for the quality that you get.  I got a grass-fed beef burger with muenster cheese, amazing.  My friend got a roast beef with horseradish - great!  Everything tastes very quality and homemade.  I think my burger was $8.95 - it was a steal!  No sides or anything, but a very quality hunk of meat and flavor.  Drinks aren't as cheap, I think a Jim Beam on the rocks was $6.50.  The atmosphere is great - it's like an old school steakhouse with a dark interior and half-moon booths.  There is a bar you can sit at (and I think eat at) and then a back room.  I've been there once in a dress and heels for drinks and once at midnight after an Against Me concert in jeans and sneakers and I didn't feel out of place either time - I probably wouldn't wear sneakers during dinner time though.  Try the late night menu!  It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Period. Fun little bar to warm up in (if you can get a little table booth) while waiting for a table. The place has great steak and is classy with an old-time feel to it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good selection of meats and taste great.  I usually end up getting the sirloin or NY Strip.  I did try the venison one time and that was also good, but mainly stick with the 2 above named cuts.  The one thing I like about this place is they have good flavor on their meat.  Its personal preference, but I prefer when there is a bit more salt on the meat rather than minimal salt and just the meat.  Price is pretty decent, you aren't going to break the bank and its always a very satisfying cut.  Pretty small place though, so sometimes you do have to wait, but its well worth it."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a great meal after seeing the great reviews, but not what i got. The place is dark like other people have said, and the prices are high. The steaks are big, but there was a funny smell about them. I had the new york strip, and some scallops. The scallops were big but the sauce seemed weird with them.  MY steak was hard to cut even as medium rare. The meal took almost an hour to get there. The waitresses are very nice, but the food was lacking. Never again for that price. I spent 90 for two people(steak, scallops, pork roast, and tip)."}
{"text":"Visitors to Madison, we went here last night as a family. Pretty blown away. Food was top notch as good as any steakhouse in Chicago or back east. The filets, salads, crab legs all were on point. Cool decor as well  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend for a nice date on a Friday night. It's interesting because it looks like a little saloon outside, but the inside was fancier than we expected.  We started out with drinks. I ordered a Whiskey Tango Foxtrot and was not impressed. My girlfriend ordered a Grotto Gris, and she enjoyed hers a lot.  For dinner, I ordered the Filet Au Poivre, which was awesome. The steak was really tender, and the sauce was also tasty. It was a bit bigger than I expected (awesome), and medium rare was about perfect.  My girlfriend ordered the venison and loved this dish as well. It was tender and the sauce was rich, but she couldn't get enough. Whatever vegetable was with it was really delicious (it was some sort of leafy green).   Overall, it was a great meal, expensive but good."}
{"text":"Based upon the Yelp reviews my expectations were a little high. I expected to be blown away, but left content with the dinner I had. The bread plate and \"relish tray\" was nice but not extraordinary. The favorite component of dinner was the sea scallops appetizer. It was served on a shell with creamy mashed potatoes and with a delectable cream sauce. Entrees included the 20 oz bone-in tenderloin and the walleye. The tenderloin appeared to be somewhat smaller than 20 oz but was incredibly moist and flavorful. The walleye had a nice crust and sauce but was forgettable. My husband and I are confused about the hype around the hash brown discus. The aesthetics comprised of dark lighting, rustic wood, and old farm details. It was charming and loud. As I mentioned, reading Yelp beforehand made me quite particular. While I enjoyed my dinner, the Tornado Club will not be one of my most memorable dining experiences."}
{"text":"It is a nice place, cozy and warm! They last sit at 10, but bar open till 12.  Food was good. Waiter was nice."}
{"text":"Tornado Stake House is my favorite place in Madison!! It is obviously the best stake house by far!! Let's start of with a great cozy and comfortable atmosphere! The service is really good they explain the dishes very well and give us recommendations!!! The food is the best, the Venison is so well prepared a seasoned also the Scallops dish is to die for it is one of my favorite dishes! We also can't forget the desserts! The desserts are really good they are so fresh and tasty I love the Chocolate Layer cake so rich and delicious and I also love the Upside down pineapple cake so good!!!   I really recommend for you to go to the best stake house in town the Tornado stake house!!!"}
{"text":"My partner and I were super excited about coming here for our anniversary. It was our first time at Tornado, and we had a solid chunk of change burning a hole in our pocket. We were ready for the whole shebang: cocktails, appetizers, steaks from grass-fed local cows, etc.  We got none of these things.   Instead, we got a rude host who gave away the table we had reserved to another couple -- as we stood by and watched. Then he ignored us while we waited near the host station for another table. We were finally seated and then promptly ignored by the waitress, to the point where we had eaten most of the bread plate and still had not even met her. We began talking about leaving, but when she came up and took our drink order we calmed down.  Then we sat. And sat some more. And a little more. And then we decided this was not how we wanted to spend our anniversary. So we left, passing the very surprised waitress on the way out.  So I can't comment on the food. But I will say the service is terrible, considering this place charges $40 per entree -- which we would have been happy to pay if someone had actually made us feel like our presence was appreciated."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in on a Monday night on way to Chicago.  Sat at bar for drinks and ended up having the steak sandwich offered on late night menu after 10:00pm.  The best EVER!  Bar has an old 1970s vibe, dim lighting and chill.  Sat next to a regular, Golfer Scott.  Super guy who eats there once a week.  Silas poured us a couple drinks and stayed around after his shift to chat.  Super guy! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the spots I used to enjoy in Madison for a late night bite. I say used to because I never had to deal with their asinine host. Haven't seen that much attitude in Zagat star restaurants....trust me this is not but maybe he had a bad day. I must say he took the pleasure out of the place. Walked around the corner to Belair and had a great time. Keep the attitude at home big boy!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan. On a quick trip to Madison, and had originally planned to go to Wonder Bar for dinner (close to the hotel and had good reviews) but their kitchen was closed at like 8:30. Lame. So my cab driver suggested Tornado. So glad.  I was a little disoriented when I first walked in beause it's sooooo dark and kinda divey, but it's divey in like an old-school, not too many frills steak house.   The menu is super simple, and normally i like lots of frills with my steak (cool sauces and sides and what have you), so I was a little \"meh\" feeling.  But everything was DELICIOUS. My steak was cooked perfectly med rare (whichsurprised me a bit - lots of places are getting weird about that one), seasoned simply, and there was seriously no need for a steak knife. Pointless when it's that tender. The spinach salad was great too, but seriously, this steak was fantastic.  And of course, service was wonderful as well. I sat solo in one of the lounge booths and my server was the perfect blend of attentive without beinig all up in my areas. I would be back in a heartbeat...ya know...if i lived here."}
{"text":"Food is amazing.  Try the frog legs or Escargot for appetizer.  The venison or walleye are prime choices for the entree.  Make sure to get the spotted cow draft also!  Ambiance is great, service is great, and it is located right next to the capitol building.  Definitely a great place to go if your visiting"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the whole world!. Been here many times, but never enough. Went here for our tenth wedding anniversary. Amazing! Fabulous steaks, fabulous ambience, fabulous service. I would be thrilled Ito die here while eating. Prime rib and enjoying a rhum & coke. It doesn't get better than this place."}
{"text":"There are so many great reviews on Yelp that have stated probably every positive aspect of this vintage establishment.  I would just like to add to this list that the beer bread and butter was absolutely divine!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Dim-light, warm, supperclubby amazingness...  Drinks: Cocktails are your best friend here. They have a decent selection of alcohol including some interesting liqueurs. The cocktails are usually mixed with perfection.  IMO the tap beer selection is poor to quite poor. Its not so much the small number of taps, but that lack of anything good filling the lines... That being said, I don't go to Tornado for the beer.  Food: The late night menu is great! The steak sandwich is great and the scallops are the best I have had in Madison."}
{"text":"In town on business and a steak sounded good. The reviews gave me to believe it would be cozy, which also suited my mood. I had a book, hunger, and a thirst for local brew. Tornado seemed like it checked all the boxes.   I came in through the back, in the bar. Normally flying solo, I'd pull up some bar and settle in, but there were no seats. Mind you, this was 6:35 on a Wednesday.  Making my way to the (disinterested, dismissive, balding) host, I asked if there was a small table I could occupy. No--but i could grab something in the bar.   Winding my way back through, still no seats at the bar, but there was an open booth. I sat. First round, food (french onion soup, steak, hash browns), second round, and a scotch to settle the meal. Everything was fine. Not stellar, not bad. Incredibly loud.   I was, without ceremony, without asking, brought my check. Here you are sir, move the **** along. Message received. My bill, with tip, was $80 for just over an hour of booth time (and two beers, dinner, and an oban 14).   The food was good, but not remarkably so. The service (server: Rachel) was adequate. Being shuffled unceremoniously out the door, however cordially? Chintzy. Honestly, I'm not being used to being treated like riff-raft. Disconcerting.   Apparently spending $80 in an hour isn't enough booth rental of a Wednesday night. So if you want to be rushed through an okay, somewhat overpriced meal, Tornado is the place. Live it up for 45 minutes or so then grab your coat. If you're looking to take your time and enjoy yourself, if you're looking for a remarkable experience, or if you just want to feel like the business you're sitting respects their customers, look elsewhere.   Not considering the treatment, this might've been a 3/5 review. As it stands, I'm not looking to go back regardless of circumstance. Hence, 1/5."}
{"text":"That neon sign really says it all! We just went to the bar, and it was perfect. Great decor, great cocktails, and (Yay!) no TV in the bar area. Wonderfully Old School, and if I lived in Madison, I would go here all the time!"}
{"text":"This place is the main reason why I am still alive after spending my last year here in Madison. I always compare my experience at Tornado steakhouse to scenes in the movie \"Midnight in Paris\". The moment you go through the door you enter a completely different world. The world that probably existed some time in the past but it is very hard to say when and where. It feels classy and the vibe helps you forget about what you have left outside - spoiled college kids and their totalitarian leader called Bucky.   Speaking of food, nothing tastes better at night than their steak sandwich with cheese curds and steak fries on the side. If you feel like trying something new check out their scallops - they are absolutely delightful.  I have never been there during the day. Some people say that this place exists during the day but I don't believe them. For me the the magic portal opens after 10pm."}
{"text":"Just arrived in Madison on business for a few days and my hotel recommended Tornado Steak House as being the hands down best steak in town. Went with a co-worker and we were not disappointed. The steaks were outstanding and our waitress Keysha took great care of us ...can't wait for a return trip!"}
{"text":"Close to the Hilton and was a real treat. Great food, drinks and service. The pork tenderloin was done to pan searing char perfection with the cherry sauce complement. My friend had the 8oz  baseball filet which was good but a little too rare for med/ rare. The supper club atmosphere was great. I don't give many 5 stars so it was special."}
{"text":"The iceburg wedge salad (featuring blue cheese and french dressing) is stupidly good...and I have found the perfect formula for a reasonably priced dinner for two...order a steak (like the awesome Steak au Poivre, a frequent special), split that with a friend. Grab a wedge and either a veggie or potato with that (two are included with the steak). Then order another wedge...boom...that'll more than fill two diners, at roughly $25 (including decent tip)...!"}
{"text":"Not sure where these reviews came from. Place was horrible. Dark, dingy and unpleasant."}
{"text":"The Tornado Room is Madison's flagship steakhouse. Great wooden paneling decor and candle lit tables gives it a 1920's feel. However, the ambiance is just the icing on the cake compared to the quality of the food and service. From birthday celebrations to anniversaries, our family has been going here for years. It is by far and away my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Maybe I was here on an off night because I really, really wanted to like this place.  The medium rare steak was medium, which I can usually live with, but I found the meat a bit chewy.  For an expensive meal, I didn't walk away impressed."}
{"text":"We must eat here every six weeks or so- it's my favorite place for dinner- just don't tell my cardiologist!  We generally start in the bar with a couple of drinks- yum- then head into dinner, where we split- yes, split- a 28-oz bone-in ribeye.  With everything else that precedes dinner- relish tray, salad, bread, who has room for beef?  We end up taking over 1/2 of it home.   It's a great place- so much better since there's no smoking- the low ceiling in the bar made for a great smoke-trap in its day."}
{"text":"Our great friends Kurt and Gina recommended we stop here for dinner and eat at the bar.   We took their advice and of course it didn't disappoint.   Three of us got spots at the end of the bar.  It was a busy Friday evening but the service from the bartenders was great.      We started with Shrimp cocktails.  5 big, tasty shrimp!    I then went with the French onion soup and the house cut Tenderloin.    Both amazing.    Everyone was pleased.   Happy with their cuts of meat.    Grab a dirty martini and be happy."}
{"text":"Great drinks, awesome late night menu.  My friends and I tried to re-create their Key Lime GImlets at home with minimal success, and the waiter kept his cool when I mistakenly called the Nuts and Berries drink \"Twig and Berries.\"  The steak sandwich is quite possibly the most delicious thing I've ever eaten, and it is one of the things I miss most about Madison."}
{"text":"Dined here last night. A bit disappointed. The crab legs were only slightly warmish. The ribeye on the bone was huge, but undercooked. Our primary server was great, but one of the support staff reached over us to fill my friend's water glass--splashed a lot of water over onto her side plate and the table and then walked away. It was weird. We spent $150 for two and it didn't meet my expectations. In general, I'd say the attention to detail has slipped. I've eaten here many times in my life... Lots of fond memories, but last night won't be one of them. I will still go back. I just hope they can get the magic back."}
{"text":"When asking the bartender about the $50 crab legs, he simply replied \"they're messy\" Way to sell it, man. Getting the vibe he didn't want us eating crab legs around him so we sat outside. Dinner was lovely and our server was attentive, welcoming and friendly. Might go back again tonight!"}
{"text":"In the 4 years I lived in Madison, I probably never had a steak better than the one here. They've got a nice wine selection and the steaks are truly massive, and cooked to perfection.  Due to the price (~$25, depending on the cut), this clientele trends toward the older crowd. If you are looking for a straightforward yet excellent meal, this might be your scene.  The adjoining bar is nothing special, although several of my friends in the service industry like to go there after work due to the solid drinks and late-night menu."}
{"text":"Omg it was sooooooooooooo good u gotta hug the chef I went on my day best steak Burger"}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is about this place.  Very loud, could hardly converse with my dinning partner.  Service was quite slow and I don't need 15 minutes to read the menu and decide what I want.  For $28 I've had better steak at Outback.  Nothing to write home about, had a big slice of grizzle going through the middle and wasn't particulary flavorful.  Wife had a tenderloin for a couple bucks less and it was OK.  OK for me means about $15 not $25 (plus you don't have to pay for the potato).  I'll go elsewhere.  This place must live on reputation and sales accounts."}
{"text":"You have not lived until you've had a night cap here with an order of the pineapple upside down cake. My boyfriend and I split an order and it was one of the best desserts of my life.   It's a classic dessert. A warm eruption of flavors in your mouth."}
{"text":"We came here after a comedy show for the $14 steaks.   Walked in to be passed by two servers and after a few minutes one finally made eye contact long enough that we got seated.   Sat in the bar/lounge area in the vinyl wrap around booths with cool pendants hanging above our tiny table.   Ordered two steaks with fries to share. Wow! It comes with a tempura- battered onion ring on top served on a hot metal plate.  Cuts so smooth and tastes so divine! Good sears on both sides of the meat with deep flavors. The fries were steak cut fries, definitely large enough to share for two."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that I don't want anyone else to know about it. I could live here if they'd let me. Have the steak sandwich, escargot and the scallops. It will be life changing."}
{"text":"This place looks like a dive from the outside but inside...has \"character.\"  Tried both the rack of lamb and the walleye, both were awesome.  Had the Caesar salad as one side, that was not very good, I'd choose something else next time.  Asparagus was, well, it was asparagus.  Hash browns were, well, they were hash browns.  For desserts, tried the chocolate toffee cake, very good!  And...pineapple upside down cake.  I never would have tried this, recalling the dry stuff from the '70s, but it was recommended and it was AMAZING.  Moist and very caramel-y.  Summary - simply average sides, but entrees and dessert were AWESOME.  Only other complaint was there was a large party in the same room we were in and it's kind of noisy, hard to carry on a conversation.  Also a little pricey.  Did not try the steak, maybe I will next time."}
{"text":"Stopped at this perfectly preserved relic after giving a presentation at the Wisconsin Historical Society. A perfect ending to a perfectly fun evening.   It used to be Crandall's supper club before the Tornado blew in here in the early 1990s. Fortunately they kept the facility intact old-school and only updated the menu. (Incidentally Crandall's catered my presentation at the WHS, which was aptly on Sconnie supper clubs, so I thought it most appropriate to go here for late nosh.)  After my gig I was all amiss because I had only one bite of my delish dessert (my fav - coconut creme pie) from Elegant Foods in Madison before I had to get up on the stage. Then I was waylaid after and when I got back to my table the pie was gone. Who took my pie??  Anyway we got to the Tornado and lo and behold, they've whirled one of my other favorite pies (key lime) into my favorite drink (malibu gimlet)! I happily ordered a  KEY LIME GIMLET, with graham cracker-crumbed rim. OMG. I couldn't believe this twist of fate. The dessert AND drink gods were smiling down.   Had a shrimp cocktail too, and on late night discount it was all a good deal. Going back here to eat next time in the Mad City fo' shizzle."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for our 8 year anniversary dinner on Saturday September 17th. Our server, Tara, was excellent! She was pleasant and attentive. We had the scallop appetizer, which was interesting. Good interesting, though! We each had French Onion soup and it was delicious. The broth tasted so fresh and the bread was chunky and wonderful. I had the steak au poivre medium with green beans and it came out perfect. My husband ordered the t-tbone medium. We waited a bit longer for the steaks than I would have expected, but we were having a good time so it didn't matter. However, we knew immediately there was a problem when the t-bone came out on a leash with a bell, still mooing. It was very rare, almost blue. Tara was immediately mortified and brought it back to cool more. We went on with the meal, and ordered pineapple upside down cake (do not miss!)  to end the meal.  When we got our check we were pleasantly surprised that we were charged only for the app and our 2 drinks from the bar. All in all, we had a great time, wonderful food, excellent service and if we're back in Madison, we'll be back at Tornado!"}
{"text":"Fantastic supper-club ambience. Come for the late night menu (after 10) for the best deals on fanatic steak sandwiches, escargot, etc."}
{"text":"Loved the old feel of this place, and it maintained a classy vibe. We had oysters, escargot, the wedge salad, tomato bisque, I had the walleye, and my husband had the rabbit. It was all delish! The portions were very nice too for a classy joint ;). I would love to go back and hang in the lounge/bar area."}
{"text":"My husband & I were less than impressed w this place. Ambiance is nice and cozy. Bread was ok and bland. My onion soup was good but that's hard to mess up. I got the fillet a puave and it was ok. It was a nice cut and for this fillet alone I'd prob give it 4 stars but everything else was disappointing. My husband got the bone in rib eye & although it was a pretty piece of meat it was more of the \"should of been a roast\" quality. Wooaaah woooaah.  =(  The hash browns we're golden on one side and raw on the inside. Steak fries were cold and bland. Coke was stale.  We won't be going back unless we go for drinks alone. Flemings still wins our vote for food still. This place just didn't make the cut."}
{"text":"My parents and I had been so so excited to finally dine at this well-known steak house downtown for their wedding anniversary, unfortunately we left disappointed and unsatisfied. The bread before our meal was the best part of the whole dining experience. I had the king crab legs and was extremely disappointed on the presentation and portion size I received. The only good part was the warm water and cloth I got to clean my hands on afterward. My mom ordered the salmon and was equally disappointed. For as expensive they price the items on their menu, you would expect higher quality ingredients. The salmon was flavorless and was so opaque that it was almost more white than it was that nice rich pink \"salmon\" color. Overall disappointing dining experience and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Thanks to all the mentions of it, we came for the late night menu right after we arrived into town. It did not disappoint. Really cool vibe inside with intimate booths and a nice bar area. The drinks were awesome and the food menu was great and extremely affordable. The French Onion soup is a must-have, too."}
{"text":"They have great steaks here.  The steaks are about two inches thick and were perfectly cooked.  The sides were also amazing.  Portions are more than generous.  Prices are a bit high, so expect to pay about $150 for two people to eat here (including beverages), so this place will be a splurge for most people.  Good atmosphere for going on a date - don't recommend bringing children.  Will definitely return for special occasions."}
{"text":"Ok, So I went here for the first time the other night for actually the late night menu and to be honest I NEVER write reviews based on one visit.... but people... OH DEAR GOD.   Let me paint you a word picture people. You walk into this little hole-in-the-wall type place by being drawn like a moth to a light with a HUGE white awning from the street. You pass some quaint outdoor seating and enter into a somewhat confusing maze to find some of the main seating and the bar. Rich wood surrounding you as it melts you into relaxation before you even reach the bar at the back of the establishment. You explore this tightly packed place by walking down some stairs to another bar, which I am going to call \"the speak easy\" with white lounge seating in an intimate space that exudes class. Candles lit and people chatting.  Coming back upstairs, My buddy and I had some cocktails and steak sandwiches in what I call the \"Middle Al Capone room\" The reason I say that is because I imagine Al Capone sitting in the corner of this all wood room underneath the small little wall lamps with a stogie and a cognac relaxing after a hard day of moonshine running... Soothing lighting throughout with small intimate booths with some close friends. This is it... Probably going to be my new favorite place...."}
{"text":"I love Wisconsin supper clubs and walked to Tornado with great anticipation. Taking in the retro building and signage, it seemed perfect.  However, I was surprised to walk into a very dark bar with little energy.  Was I in Madison, Wisconsin?   Using the flashlight on my phone, I was able to peruse the limited offerings of steak and seafood on the menu.  We ordered breaded shrimp, New York Strip steak, hash browns and a baked potato.  The shrimp had a thick beer batter that overwhelmed the poor shrimp.  My steak was done Pittsburgh style, how I like it, but was very dry.  The taste was good though.  Our potatoes were okay, but nothing special.  Cocktails were surprisingly weak and service was, well weird. Our first bartender was attentive enough, but not overly warm.  He left, replaced by a young woman who was the epitome of a space cadet. She would ignore us while she conversed with other patrons at the bar.  I had to be rather rude and interrupt her sociability, letting her know we were finished. She cleared our plates, and we asked about dessert.  She mentioned a couple of items and walked away.  We looked at each other, shrugged, and a few minutes later I got her attention and asked again about dessert. Without any eye contact, she yelled at her manager, \"tell them about dessert.\" He kindly walked over, told us about dessert, and we ordered a couple of desserts to go.  As I said, weird. Prices were fairly high.  My steak was $39.00.  Tornado turned out to be a great disappointment, and I doubt will shall return."}
{"text":"Love it. Great food. Great late night. Great bartenders. Awesome ambiance. Classy 50s"}
{"text":"Make reservations because this place gets packed. However my boyfriend and I were able to get a seated by the romantic cozy tables by the bar that doesn't need reservations. Food was amazing and the wine is mMmm!!! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Tornado Club for dinner and had a mixed experience.  I should note that we are 'big city' folks, with a history of steakhouse eating.  And it's not fair to rate a restaurant in Madison in relation to say.. a top tier restaurant in Chicago or NY. So, I'll try to deal with it on its own merits.  The food tasted very good.  The restaurant's forte was clearly the quality of their ingredients (save for one, which I'll address).  We both had beef steaks and the quality of the meet was superb.  We both had french onion soup, which was delicious.  And we shared a cheese tasting.  We were pleasantly surprised at the flavor parings used in that cheese tasting.  As for the decor/ambiance, it was sort of that old school steakhouse feel with a touch of elegance.  It was nice.  Now, there were a few drawbacks to the experience.  The first was the apparent love affair with onions.  I like onions.  But onion was used in everything.  When I asked how the steaks were prepared, I was told that they used garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  (I would have preferred the waiter to tell me they used a garlic and onion dry rub.. just sounds nicer).  Interestingly, that onion powder was used in all of their breads (different types of bread, but all had the taste of onion powder in it).  Then in a moment of humor, my steak also had an onion ring on top. :)  The steak's preparation was actually pretty tasty.  But the problem was, with their breads and the onion soup,... by the time we got to the steak, the onion powder became more of a nuisance than a pleasure.  So, in sum, the flavors by themselves were good.  But the meal, put together, just seemed unbalanced.  Also, since my wife was not drinking, I ordered a wine by the glass.  To be sure, this is usually the worst way to order wine.  And I am aware of the inherent markup used in restaurants with their wine.  So, when paying $8 for a glass, I don't have my expectations very high.  But it was actually a pretty bad shiraz.  And the server did not show us the bottle, or wait to see if I liked it, which seems standard when serving wine (in a non-cheap restaurant).  The server was friendly, but with strange wine service and making the steak preparation sound 'cheap', it could have been better.  All in all, we had a decent experience, but we left feeling like we paid too much for what we got overall.  The individual food elements were good.  And the core ingredients were excellent.  But it just didn't all come together for us."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally scored a date night for the first time in months. This was a splurge and after drinks, meals, and desert, we sailed by a hundred dollar bill for the evening - which would normally put us both off going back - but everything was perfect. Service, food, drinks, attention and ambiance ... perfection. The value was in the quality of the food and everything else that made our visit one to remember.  The steaks were perfect. Flavorful and cooked to exactly a med rare as ordered. The sides were a great compliment. Even something as boring as mashed potatoes had a culinary flair or seasoning that made them memorable.  There is nothing bad on the menu and even if you don't spend a lot, the waitstaff and bartenders are fantastic. I came back with a few coworkers one evening just for a drink and desert and got the same great service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Tornado.  If there is one thing that Madison is blessed with, it is prime Midwest beef. You could go here or the other three steak houses around the square and get amazing beef. You should cater your choice based on the steak and atmosphere you are looking for.  Tornado room is well known for its classic supper club atmosphere, well mixed classic cocktails, and finally, in my opinion, two cuts of steak that really should always be ordered over the rest.   Before I deliberate about the steaks, a few important details. Each table gets a fun mug of an assortment of vegetables and bread. The steaks come out on a heated plate. Also, all steaks come with a large onion ring, and that onion ring is really damn tasty.  I sincerely believe that the bone-in filet is what you should order every time you come here. If you eat bone-in filets often, then you know that you are getting a flavorful, excessively tender, and well marbled piece of beef. Some how, Tornado Room's bone-in tenderloin is a cut above.  The other is the ribeye. That doesn't require any explanation obviously."}
{"text":"This place is insane. The atmosphere, the food, the service! Are all off the charts great.  I went there for the ribeye but got there after they shut the dinner menu down. I had to settle for the New York strip. But lo and behold when all the food came out there was my ribeye steak cooked to perfection. I guess my begging the waitress paid off. I also got a shrimp cocktail was holy hell huge good. And only 12 bucks. And I can't forget the lettuce wedge that was the best I've ever had.  I would come back to Wisconsin just to go to this place. I did not eat the fries or the giant onion ring. But I gave it to the people that were with me and they said they were amazing. One of my new favorite places on the planet. By the way this all took place after 12 AM on a Friday night. Incredible"}
{"text":"Tornado Steak House is a Madison classic and one of the best restaurants in town. If you want a great meal in a welcoming clubby environment, you won't be disappointed.  -The space is like an old school lodge and feels very Wisconsin. It's dimly lit with rich woods, spacious booths and a great bustling bar as well. -Very friendly and attentive service. -Fresh warm bread loaf and soft bread sticks are brought out with rich Wisconsin butter. -They also give you a retro relish tray, totally non-ironically. -They make killer old fashioneds--classic and special options. -Shrimp cocktail was phenomenal with enormous shrimp and great cocktail sauce with lots of horseradish. -Steak prices aren't cheap--but they come with salad or soup and a side--which you rarely see these days. -Wedge salad was great--I had them chop mine, which I recommend. -Signature bone-in tenderloin is to die for. -Bone-in ribeye is also excellent and they do good filets. -The steaks are served with a delicious crunchy onion ring on top. -Baked potato was awesome--served with good sour cream. -Side of asparagus was generous.  Lots of food--you'll have leftovers! We'll definitely be back next time we're in Madison!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Madison.  You won't be blown away when you walk in, it's more subtle than that.  Every steak I've had here was fantastic, everyone I've been here with has loved their dinner.  The bar is where it's at though.  The warm, dark lighting, the classic jazz playing softly over the air, bartenders that know what they're doing.  This place really grew on me, and is a perfect alternative to the crowded and noisy State Street standards. That might actually turn some people off- if you're looking for a place to go crazy this ain't it.  Still, every time I'm back in town I make sure to spend an evening here."}
{"text":"5 stars. Filet au poivre is to die for.   This is a steakhouse from the 1950s. Classic wood ambiance. Classic 50s steaks. Classic 50s look.   Don't be afraid of the classic styling, come on in and enjoy!  Homemade soups, salads, and cocktails. Full bar with a decent wine list.   There is always a wait, so consider sitting and eating at the bar.   Fresh Steaks, fresh veggies, and solid cocktails.   I wonder if Dean Martin's ghost is hanging out in the corner with a stiff drink...I would!"}
{"text":"Food superb. Such a great meal. The filet au poivre is awesome.   The pineapple rum upside down cake was sooo good.   I liked our server but service was a little slow and took forever to get drinks.   Overall, such a good experience. I would highly recommend planning ahead with a reservation and eating in the dining room."}
{"text":"I love the Rat Pack loungie feel and ambiance of the bar area. Locate right off the Capitol Square the Tornado Room has the best steak downtown. However if I had to choose my favorite steak house in Madison based on the steak itself I would go with Jim Delaney's Charcoal Steaks or Flemings."}
{"text":"Late night menu is the way to go. The scallops with mashed potatoes and lemon are really good."}
{"text":"This, by a wide margin, is my very favorite place to eat and drink in Madison.   The food is always fantastic. I've been to dinner many times over the years and also to have their late night menu options and they've not failed me once. The atmosphere is always comfortable and the servers are always professional and personable.   For dinner, I recommend the filet in your choice of size, and get hash browns or Brussels sprouts to go along with it.   For late night, get the bacon bleu cheese burger and cheese curds.   Oh, and get the classic brandy old fashioned, sweet. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Easy 5 Stars  I think everything what makes this place hum and purr like a well oiled machine has already been written. So I won't be rehashing a bunch of issues ya'll should know. I'm gonna stick with three things. The craft cocktails, the steak and the vibe.   Hip and Sexy  The lounge here is a throwback in time  circa 1970. I love this $hit man. Where Bartenders are Mixologists and the Old Fashion is king. Our Mixologist was Greg. Hip looking dude with his billy goat beard. He makes my wife a Cadillac Old Fashion and me a Flew the Coop. Both drinks are outstanding but I want more. I ask Greg to make me something special. His eyes light up and he says, I've been working on this drink that uses spicy pear liquor and bourbon. My reply, I'll take one. So and true mixologist form Greg breaks out his little black book that he has probably written down more ideas for drinks that you can shake a stick too. So I watch him and he's like a mad scientist with a Billy goat beard muddling a sugar cube soaked in bitters. Then he puts in alittle of this alittle of that and gives it a sample. Then back to work as he adds some apple cider beer and rims the glass with a lemon peel and presto, he hands me his drink. I said what's the name? His reply, he doesn't have one yet. I take a sip and this baby is smooth. Tastes like a beautiful fall day in a glass. The pear,  the apple, the bitters, the sugar and the bourbon were fucking excellent. I told Jeff that the name of this drink is Greg's Fall Back or GFB. In honor of the time clocks being pushed back an hour in the fall (extra hour of sleep) this would be a perfect name for such a tasty libation. He said he liked the name and would keep it. hooray!  Hmmmm Steak.  I am a far cry from a fancy well to do guy. I'm not a lobbyist, politician, or a slick salesperson, I'm a regular dude. One thing is for sure this regular dude knows his steak. It's not rocket science to tell a great steak from a shitty one or if it's cook right or not. Fuck man it's common sense. The 8 ounce filet I got here was money. Served up \"old style\" on a sizzling metal platter. I ordered it medium. I cut right down the center of this bad boy to see if the chef got my temp right. Bingo, perfect. Perfect pink center and just awesome to look at. Now the taste. Meat. Yes I said it. It taste like meat. WTF does that mean? I want my steak to taste like meat not some doctored up sauce ladled, marinaded piece of turd. Let me taste the meat flavor baby. My steak had IT. I would say they used a seasoned salt and just pepper when cooking this bad boy. I don't think they used a plain salt. One word, delicious.  Vibe  We walked in they the lounge and it looks like time stopped around 1972. Don't get me wrong nothing was old or tattered. It was a perfectly restored lounge from the 70's. I kept waiting for Marsha Brady to walk in. That scored high points with me. From the paneling, to the booths to the lighting fixtures this place oozed hip and yes I'm fucking sexy. The same theme runs thru the restaurant with the dark woods with almost a 70s hunting lodge feel in the dining room we ate in. Very cool and I was impressed.  Verdict  I asked the Yelpers of Madison to help a vacationing brother out where to get a great steak and they did. I can't thank you enough and that's why I love Yelp. Remember to tell Greg the mixologist ( you are not a bartender) that Dan from Ft. Lauderdale sent you for his Greg's Fall Back or GFB and Stay Hungry!"}
{"text":"To me steak is steak, but this place was a step above.  My husband is the beef aficionado.  I often order the salmon at steak places.  I did however choose steak being as most of the reviews mentioned steak.  They did have a Bison special for the evening but I am not really a fan of bison either.  It also sold out about 30 minutes into dinner service (we got there for early dinner) so if you like bison I would suggest calling ahead.  As a starter, they brought out an array of bread, long bread stick, whole grain loaf and some type of biscuit.  And lovely little crudites in an ice filled glass.  We started with wedge salad that had an very nice strong blue cheese dressing.  My husband ordered the New York strip and I ordered the 8 oz filet both excellent.  I was pleasantly surprised when the vegetables come out properly cooked at a steak place.  We also splurged on a bottle of wine, which the server suggested.  Also delicious!  We could only partially blame the wine for the fact that we left there full and happy.  We want to go back for the after 10pm special and of course the desert we didn't room for.  Definitely on our list of restaurants to return to."}
{"text":"Amazing !!! I arrived at 10 pm, exactly when they start the late night menu until 1 am. Nice options mostly on the meat side of course at very fair prices. $$ . I went for the Wedge salad as appetizer, the dressing is out of this world, try it! Then I got reccomended of the Steak Sandwich au jeu...oh boy, that it must be a signature piece because I fainted by the great taste of it. The bread, the cheese and the meat, absolutely fantastic. And to end...the upsidown pineapple cake! OMG. They got my 5 stars right there at that point. Ambiance is very intimate on a candle light, it wasn't too loud and the restaurant until 10 has more of a classic tables area, the after 10 pm tables area cannot really accomodate more than 4/5 people and has more of a speakeasy intimate cocktail bar vibe where they still serve food. To go back again."}
{"text":"We came here for a business dinner a few nights ago.  With it being a steakhouse and going by the pricing, I was expecting to have to bust out my ballgown and heels.  However, when I walked in, it seemed like a place where you could dress up or down for the meal.    While the pricing is high (I mean, it's a steakhouse; so, that is a given), they do give you very healthy portions for your money.  Other steakhouses charge an arm and a leg and sometimes leave you hungry.   I did not find that to be true at Tornado.  In fact, I was able to take some food home and make a second meal of it.  I ordered the duck with currant sauce, which was delectable.  The meat was nice and tender and nowhere near overcooked, which was my main concern when I initially ordered it.  It came with a soup and a baked potato.  The baked potato was your standard potato (though large).  I chose the french onion soup.  Mmm...... Delicious.  We had the frog legs as an appetizer, which were lightly battered and fried and came with the most scrumptious sauce atop them.  For dessert, everyone at the table ordered just about everything.  I personally tried a bite of the chocolate caramel pecan tart we ordered and it was divine.  I especially loved that it had just a touch of sweetness and was not the sugar bomb I expected.  As far as ambience, I did find it quite dark inside.  I know it's likely meant to be \"mood lighting,\" but I found it a little hard to see and also heard others around who were not in my party commenting the same.  Despite there being large groups in the same little area we were in, the noise level was perfect.  Not too quiet and not so loud I could not engage in conversation with my colleagues.  Also, the vegetable garnish used as a centerpiece at the table was nice little touch (and very creative).  The service was prompt and helpful.  My water glass was rarely empty, empty plates were removed from my spot in a timely manner, and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable.    I would definitely come back here or recommend this place for someone looking for a nice evening out or celebrating in style.  Everyone at my table commented on how delicious their food was (even the day after) and how relaxing the space was."}
{"text":"I was surprised with the crowd, not what I expected for this area of town! The bread was great, the salad glass was great, service and atmosphere were excellent. French onion soup some of the best. The only ( beef ) I had was asked for medium and came out rare! But overall to good to knock down a star."}
{"text":"Being from out of state, I had the pleasure of being introduced to the Tornado Room from some local friends. This is what solid fine dining looks like. The decor hadn't changed since the 60's, so at first glance you wonder how things will go. Don't worry. The drinks were mixed perfectly and the service attentive and professional. The menu might be a bit limited, but when you do it as good as this place does, who cares? I had the best duck I ever ate- and I'm a professional chef. All the steaks were grilled perfectly. Sides were well done and the blue cheese dressing on my salad ( you don't get a choice) was house made and solid. Worth the prices for an exceptional meal."}
{"text":"After a show at the High Noon (Snail Mail - check her out, she's 17 and rocks!), my partner and I were both a few drinks in and in search of some yummy grub. I'd heard good things about the Tornado late night menu so we decided to walk over to satisfy our late night cravings for red meat.   It was Saturday night and the weather was amazing for January, so the place was pretty busy with people who presumably had had a few and were hungry too, but we didn't wait too long to be seated.   My partner and I had the steak sandwich, which was absolutely scrumptious. The meat was juicy and tender, the caramelized onions were a good touch, and the bun was well toasted and crunchy. There was a lot of horseradish sauce on the sandwich so I'd probably get it on the side next time.   For $9 for a steak sandwich, you really can't beat the price. So if you're looking for a cheap satisfying eat on a Saturday night, look no further than the Tornado Room."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. The rest of the meal wasn't so bad either...! Service outstanding. Expensive meal but worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely just love Tornado! We have been here several times and it just keeps getting better. We took another couple with us this last time and they loved it just as much. The Atmosphere inside is cozy and warm, with dim lighting and wood paneling. Very nice for a romantic dinner or a celebration with friends. Friendly service in a relaxed environment!  We started off with the Shrimp Cocktail and Oysters Rockefeller. Both very delicious! We all had the wedge salad and a bottle of wine. My husband had the 16 oz. New York Strip while the other two with us had the 28 oz. Ribeye on the Bone and 8 oz. Filet. All 3 said it was cooked to perfection and melted in their mouth. I had the boiled shrimp which was excellent! Both the guys had the hash browns which was enough for all four of us! We finished off dinner with a coffee while making plans for the next time we would return."}
{"text":"The Tornardo is a classic supperclub with great food.  The steaks are outstanding, but if you are looking for a cheaper option try the pork loin with tart cherry sauce.  The wedge salad is a classic and they make good Old Fashioneds too!"}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant!  Food was great, service was great.  Would easily recommend."}
{"text":"My anniversary dinner experience here was memorable, for one reason...the food. We had fair but a tad slow service the entire night, but the food was worth it.  First, we stopped in the bar for a drink. Plenty of space in the bar for comfortable seating. They even have booths. Lighting was very dark, but candles made it so you could read the menu. It took 15-20 minutes for us to receive our drinks after ordering. This was slower than my expectation.   For our dinner, we were seated in the main dining area. We had a booth to ourselves, which was great!  It took a while to get our drink order in to our waitress. She was very busy. We started the night with a bottle of red wine and shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were huge and fresh! The bread they give you to start the night with, is also great! After, we both had the wedge salad. It was very tasty, but maybe a bit too much dressing. I couldn't finish the salad because the lettuce had become soggy. My boyfriend ordered the 10oz Filet au Poivre with hash browns (our waitresses recommendation). He was very pleased with his meal but wished there were more options of steak that were 10 oz. I had the rabbit. This was a leap of faith for me. It was awesome! Tasted very much like chicken, just a tad tougher. I would recommend!! I also, had the hash browns. I would recommend the hash browns. Lastly, we shared a big piece of cheesecake with two glasses of sparkling rose. What a way to end the night!   We will be back. We really enjoyed our dinner. I would have posted pictures, however, the lighting is too dim to get any ones to do the food justice."}
{"text":"Finally made it to late night!! So good! Ordered the sirloin, steak sandwich, onion rings, iceberg salad. All sooooo goood. Even better than expected... wasn't even starving. and that's saying a lot from me. Also got a bottle of red wine. Reasonably priced yummy malbec. :) my fave is the steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Always terrific.  Food and service is consistently great.  Like many reviewers say the aesthetics leave something to be desired but that can be ignored for the food and service."}
{"text":"Great place!  I'm from out of town so I may not be the best source on prices, but I felt like they were very reasonable as well given the quality of the food.  I got the fillet au poivre with steak fries as well as the oysters rockefeller for an appetizer.  The oysters were well flavored, and surpassed my expecations, especially given the fact that I was eating oysters in Madison, WI.  The steak was fantastic.  I ordered rare and I have learned never to take it for granted when you order a rare steak and it actually comes out as such. In my many years of steak eating, I have learned that I should only ever order steak at a restaurant that specializes in steak for this very reason.  Tornado did not let me down.  I didn't order any drinks, but a number of my friends got various highballs, and from what I could see and gather, the drinks here are also high quality & well prepared.  Great food, drink, & atmosphere.  Definitely in the recommendation category!"}
{"text":"The Steak Sandwich was a phenomenal and affordable late night treat. Swanky in all respects from the service to the lighting to the music! My friend even got to keep a sea shell with her scallops which came with the softest potato My tongue has ever graced."}
{"text":"OG steakhouse in Madison, Wisconsin that looks like it hasn't changed much since it was on top of its game in the 1950's ... and is still on top.  The bar is great too ... our bartender was focused on making my martini like he was Picasso painting Guernica. Damn good.  Tornado is first class - if you're in Madison don't miss it."}
{"text":"I can NOT comment on the food because we ended up not eating here due to the menu not being what we were told it was. There was nothing on there that we were told they had and the prices were about 2 times more expensive than we were told. However I will comment on what I did notice and experience while there.  They have a beautiful area outside to sit and eat with nice tables. If you chose to sit inside, give your eyes a couple minutes to adjust because it is much darker inside the restaurant than it is walking on the sidewalk at night.  The staff that did bother to talk to us were not very friendly - but they weren't rude either.   If we go back (now that we know what to expect) I will update the review but for now this is all I can say."}
{"text":"First impression walking in. Old school, dark, very cozy. Great atmosphere.   Had a reservation and we were seated immediately. Waiter was clear and knowledgeable, prompt and courteous.   I have been to the likes of mannys, Ruth's Chris, cap grille, etc and the 20oz bone-in tenderloin was one of the best steaks I've ever had. Very well seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium.   Very impressed and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food! Tasty!  I have been twice and both times I have been  happy with the service. At my most recent visit in Dec. of 2011 our waitress was very polite and attentive to our needs staying on-top of the drinks and hors d'oeuvres. The steak was cooked to perfection. For appetizers we had the escargot, frog legs, and shrimp cocktail.  The frog legs were great and prepared in a tasty sauce.  The escargot was in my opinion sub par.   My only real issue with the evening was the noise. The room we were sat in behind the wall of the bar had horrible acoustics. To be fair I think part of it was due to a few large and loud parties but it was clear that the room had poor acoustics. I don't enjoy yelling across the table to person across from me.  The first time I ate at the Tornado Room we were sat in the room off the kitchen area and the noise had not been an issue so I would recommend requesting that area for seating if making a reservation."}
{"text":"Madison resident for the better part of a decade now, and I've probably owed them this review since day 1. My go-to spot for special occasions, business dinners, date night, and late night dinners. My normal dinner is usually the NY Strip, and they always just hit a home run. The steak fries are phenomenal. The batter they use for onion rings and fried shrimp is outstanding. Speaking of the fried shrimp, it's the best you're going to find in the Midwest. While I expect life to take me out of Madison as homebase sometime in the near future, I will be back to town frequently and likely stopping at Tornado during many of those visits."}
{"text":"Our party had a great meal there. I was there for a business meeting and the service was great -- and so were the steaks. Crowd was intimate and the lights were low -- but we never felt like we were in too formal of a setting.  Place was great -- and I went for the filet which they cooked just how we wanted. Wine was excellent too. I think they could lighten up the bar area a little bit, but that is the entire theme of the spot."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite restaurant in all of Madison, behind the IHOP on University Ave. I'm a DIE-HARD French onion soup aficionado (sp), and there's no contest in the entire city. It's not too salty; the bread isn't too soggy; and there's just the right amount of cheese. Steaks and steak sandwiches are awesome, way better than the overrated Gibson's in Chicago. I especially like the steak sandwich with au jus sauce. Finally, atmosphere is awesome. It looks like a dump from the outside, and Tornado has resisted interior decor gimmicks. Feels like the set of a Ray Liotta movie with awesome darkened lighting that lets you daydream about being a mafioso.Lots of rooms that give the sense \"a lot is going on\" when the place gets busy. Only thing I wish is they had a TV at the bar upstairs. Hours are great. 1 AM on a weekday is dope."}
{"text":"We were seated in the club room which was smaller, darker, more intimate. We felt special, at the same time awkward -- when the other table wasn't talking we felt that they were listening to our convo!  Service was ok; steak was awesome! I ordered Filet au Poivre for the first time and LOVED it. I usually order a filet. My friends ordered filets and loved theirs too. I was about to order \"rare +\" but the waitress said they usually undercook their meat, so I stuck with medium rare, and it was perfect.   I had their spinach salad with bacon and that was really yummy too. Their flourless choco cake was just ok; liked the creme caramel better. Wine was great too."}
{"text":"I had the tenderloin and I have to say I've had better but it was still good.  All the food that came with it was excellent.  My companion got prime rib with horseradish sauce that I thought was wonderful (better than the tenderloin).  Great ambiance.  Make reservations a week in advance or more though."}
{"text":"A high-end steak house, Midwestern college town style, dark and traditional with some trendy accents for the kids.  Adjoins the celebrated Tornado Club, where (rumor has it) the members of the rock band Garbage have been known to hang out regularly."}
{"text":"As great as the steaks are, the wedge salad was the best I ever had, and the pineapple upside down cake was absolutely phenomenal!  Best yet, the service was outstanding.  We were seated right next to a group of overly intoxicated, loudmouthed, obnoxious post-game customers and the hosts made sure we were moved to another table, and they were super nice about it.  That kind of service will keep us coming back! (Even on a home-game Saturday :)"}
{"text":"Been going here for 12 years. Steak is great service friendly, can you please clean the men's room so it doesn't smell like urine? Every time I go here the smell of the men's room reeks of urine.. Funny thing is it's always been this way and I'm not really easily turned but for the $$$$ they charge and the great food I would think this is pure laziness.."}
{"text":"After hearing how terrific the food and atmosphere are at Tornado Club, I was eager to try it. I had the 8 oz filet and my girlfriend had the queen cut of prime rib on a recent Saturday night. Even though the restaurant is listed as wheelchair accessible, it was difficult to turn the sharp corner into the bar from the front door and if the bar is busy, it's nearly impossible to negotiate my large power wc between the vintage barstools and excessively large booths. Also, the well-worn marble in the doorway needs to be replaced--it forms a large, uneven surface which further complicates a difficult entryway for a wheelchair-using patron. My steak was good, if slightly undercooked from my medium request. The hash brown were greasy and overly cooked and my underwhelming barley mushroom soup was heavy on the former while the latter was nearly non-existant. My gf's prime rib was tasty, but the cut was particularly thin and excessively fatty compared with other restaurants in Madison. Overall, Smoky's still rules in my book and perhaps it's impossible for any steak house to live up to the kind of love the Tornado gets from it's devotees. It just didn't do it for me and Smoky's doesn't make you choose between soup or salad (both are included) and each include a relish tray and bread--for pretty much the same price. For me though, the flavor of my steak wasn't as good as Smoky's and it was disappointingly undercooked. I'm probably like most diners who don't go to the trouble to send it back, not wanting to wait or make a fuss."}
{"text":"5 stars for late night Madison dining.   We ordered from a 1 page \"late night\" menu. The two of us shared a steak sandwich (about $10, 9.50 maybe?) and an order of onion rings ($6.50).  The sandwich was on a good sized round bun and came with a bowl of au jus.  It was the best steak sandwich we've ever had. Steak is sliced and piled very high. The onion rings were SPECTACULAR. We have never had such great rings, they came with horseraddish sauce and a tomato based sauce. They are sliced thick and the batter is super crispy.     Total bill for food was under $20.  Last time we were in town for a late night snack we spent that much at Ians Pizza ($4 slice×4 slices). Ians was ok, but we thought this was much better food for the same money.   Staff was friendly and QUICK.  Decor was retro and comfortable seating. We are not from the area and everyone we asked at our hotel recomended this place for steak dinner.  Even the cab driver who dropped us off knew it was the place to go late night for the \"best\" steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Often times when someone says that a restaurant is a tradition in a city, it ends up being disappointing. The Tornado Club is a tradition and it is head and shoulders the best in Madison. It is not as fancy as some places and feels a bit like a supper club, but when the food is this good the traditional feel just adds to the experience. It has everything you would expect from a high end steakhouse without trying too hard the way the chains do. Great food, great service, and for a high end place, prices are reasonable - at least you feel like you got what you paid for."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never reviewed this fabulous restaurant. May the \"reviewer God\" forgive me.  A few nights ago, I was treated to dinner by a good friend. We arrived at  7 pm and was seated on the lovely patio. The weather was perfect and there was no noise to contend with.   My friend had a glass of wine, I abstained. A glass filled with a few raw veggies was placed on the table as we reviewed the menu. My friend stated that she always eats the rib-eye. I asked if it was large enough to share. Boy was it! We ate well at the restaurant and still had enough for two more meals.  The rib-eye was medium rare and was seasoned perfectly. My dining pal allowed me to chew on the bone, which is my favorite \"steak related\" activity. The meat was juicy and so flavorful. We each had some salad and hash browns. The dressing was homemade French Roquefort and it was the perfect compliment to the mixed salad. The hash browns were expertly crisped and very tasty.   Both the experience and the food were excellent. I think our waitress was in training, but she hit the mark at every turn often stepping in just as she was needed. It was a lovely evening all around."}
{"text":"The Tornado room is the best place to be taken on a date. I say taken because when you enter this steakhouse it feels respectably like you are slipping into another decade. I'm not sure which, but you could pick your favorite. You could be like my friend who loves odd decades and image your way into the 50s. Or do a throw back and pretend you are doing the prohibition dive bar thing. You pick.  Which of course means ladies didn't go on dates. They get taken.  The bar is dark and supercool. The cocktails are swanky-feeling. Maybe think in your head of a cooler word than swanky, becuase I don't think that's a cool word any more but these cocktails are cool.  The tables are warm dark and intimate booths. Candles. Perfect.   The food is so good. Mmm, many meats.   Dessert - usually a product that half way through I find myself wondering, \"Why did I order another thing? This doesn't fit inside me?\" - but not at Tornado. At Tornado I ate it all and loved every bit."}
{"text":"A old Madison classic and favorite steakhouse. It has a supper club feel - all meals came with choice soup or salad, and vegetable or potato, but there are several choice for each. I usually get the fillet au poivre and Yorkshire pudding. The French onion soup and the Roquefort salad are also my favs."}
{"text":"I had a high expectation for this place the moment I peek into the dark wooden walled den from the front window. The small entrance, tiled with what looked like custom ceramics, the dark bar, a man in a suit that looked at you funny before offering service. This  place must be good! Well, the things they put on your table were handsome. The wait was courteous and abundantly cute. But the Caesar salad, in which I measured the quality of an eatery, was bland (other than the healthy size of anchovy lying on top). The signature Steak au Poivre so encrusted in peppery exoskeleton, I could not cut through the meat without straining. Combination of the mushroom sauce and the peppercorn crust was tasty, maybe in smaller amount, but the way it was, I couldn't taste the expensive meat at all. May be next time..."}
{"text":"The outside of this restaurant has always prevented me from going in. However, it was awesome. I didn't get steak - I got the venison and a cheese plate appetizer. It was all delicious.  Service: Wonderful. My waitress was very very friendly and attentive. Environment: A little bit woodsy, but cozy. Dark (like all steak houses). And I like that it's made up of lots of different small rooms rather than one large dining area."}
{"text":"I am from California & this is the worst steak house. I will compared this to Sizzler Restaurant."}
{"text":"My experiences with this restaurant have varied greatly depending on where I sat. For the booths in the front room, I'd give this place 5 stars. The cocktails are delicious, and the bartenders and waitresses are very willing to help you decide which to get. My favorite one is the James Madison. For the downstairs, which is where I've sat more often, I have to give this place 3. The service was horrendous. Granted, I went during their late night hours (so it was more of a rowdy crowd), but two times in a row I had to wait over an hour for my french onion soup. SOUP! It was pretty miserable. Unfortunately, those times have left a bad taste in my mouth and I have not returned since. Despite my bad experiences with the service, I would still recommend checking this place out at least once. Try to sit in the front room or outside when it's nice out."}
{"text":"Really great steaks cooked to perfection!  There are a lot of choices in Madison for a Steak but this place is a must try!  It has that old Wisconsin feel to it!"}
{"text":"The steaks taste like the cows had a good life.   Amazing steak. Amazing bread and sides. Amazing cocktails. I went there with a large group for dinner and we had great food and great service."}
{"text":"Go there. Get the steak (or steak sandwiches late night). Enjoy the ambiance. Have a few drinks, may I suggest an Old Fashioned. You won't regret it.   Sorry this one is short, but hopefully its as sweet as their pineapple upside down cake or my personal favorite the carrot cake."}
{"text":"This is a spectacular place to go if you have the coin (if you don't have the coin check out the late night menu.)  Certainly one of the more expensive places in Madison that are totally worth the money.  I would say I even rank it above Harry Carey's, and far superior to Ruth Chris or any chain.    Let's get into the meat of the review.  The steaks are unbelievable.  Perfectly done, each time I have visited.  I like mine medium rare somehow the exterior is perfectly charred.  The inside is perfectly warm and red.  The hash browns are better than I've ever had.  I have had the bone in tenderloin, wow, just wow.  Huge, excellently seasoned and with the perfectly cooked exterior.  I have not had that cut anywhere else to compare, but I can't imagine anyone else doing it better.  I have also had the T-Bone and fillet cut, those were also amazing.  The cut of the beef does make a difference and they get it perfect.  The T-bone was also perfectly seasoned, enough to enhance the flavor without over powering the real steak flavor that you are looking for.  I did have the chance to taste the salmon as well.  I was shocked at how well it was done.  The quality again was top notch.  The vegetable side was also perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The soup, I would go just for the soup. The French onion is excellent.  I think it may be my second favorite, but still better than anything I have tried in Madison.  The soup de joure's  I have tried have been amazing.  The corn chowder with crab, was unbelievable.  The flavor and perfection of the chef, made me wish I ordered the crab as an entrée (maybe next time.)     The ambience is unassuming, you can wear basically whatever you would like, within reason.  The bar is very comfortable and inviting.  I really love the main dining area.  It has a cabin like feel.  There are some excellent quotes on the exposed beams."}
{"text":"OK place but had better. Steak was OK although for the price i was expecting better. we were seated on a table and the seats were small. No parking, had to drive around till i found a ramp (with pay meters) not too far."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago went in late on a Wednesday entertaining some friends from Paris.  From the host who greeted us to the server to the kitchen helping a few vegetarians, everything was wonderful.  Thanks Tornado!"}
{"text":"I am sad to say, I only came here for drinks.  We had a vegetarian in our group and it just did not look like she could eat.  But we came for drinks after dinner and I LOVED IT.  It loved the decor (inside and outside), our server was great, the wine list was good, and the SMELL of beef was the most amazing thing I had ever smelled.  We talked all weekend about how sad we (the meat eaters) were that we missed out on one of those JUICY STEAKS.  But- I have declared we are coming back next year for the Taste of the Midwest and my FIRST STOP will be here."}
{"text":"I'm not big on visiting the same restaurants over and over again, because I like to try new things. But I've been to tornado at least 8-10 times, and every time it's been for the late night menu.  Expect a wait if you have a larger group. Don't rule out sitting in their entire extra dining room downstairs / underground, and you can sit outside on warmer nights too.   Everything on the late night menu is a steal. The steak is always good. It comes out with a giant onion ring on top. The scallops come out on a giant shell and are also great. The burgers are all good, the blue cheese and the salmon burger are my especial favorites.  These are big meals, so make sure you skip dinner so that you can get these down late at night. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"I love their late night menu and enjoy their wine selection. I've had such bad luck with rude bartenders here. I'm also in the service industry and expect at least a better first impression than I've gotten more than twice. All I ask is for a bit more positivity even if they're having a bad day to understand I'm only looking to have every reason to tip them 20% +. The bartender Nick R. was very personable and made my recent visit much more palatable."}
{"text":"Came here for the late night menu. Steak sandwiches were gone by midnight, so def comekn the earlier side if you want that!  I ended up getting the meunster burger and fries, along with a cocktail.  Cocktails were pretty decent! Some of my friends were a little bit sweet.   Burger was A+, the meat had a really good texture and the taste was definitely there! Melted cheese over the patty was soooo good.  Fries were average. The texture was very good, crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. Only problem is that it was bland and not salted at all. I usually like my fries with a bit of preseasoning.   Cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Madison for late night food and drinks. I don't usually order something as heavy as a steak sandwich, but if someone else at your table orders one, you will regret not doing the same. Fried cheese curds - what's there to improve upon - but I swear Tornado's is the best.   The old-timey jukebox in the basement worked the last time I was there, and takes coins. I think it fits the decor better than a giant LCD jukebox would. Late night jams and metabolism-ruining consumption, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place has got some great character. I actually wish I had gone here for drinks because it's sweet. The steaks are solid although if you don't want a rare steak, then I would suggest asking for well done. We went here for restaurant week and my friend unfortunately was not thrilled with the bloody steak we received. I loved it, but that is not everyone.   There are a few good places to get steak in Madison, but this place is the most down to earth. Other places will be a bit stuffy if that is not your thing (e.g. white table clothes)."}
{"text":"Absolute heaven. Umm. Can't really think of anything else to add... except eat here. Unless you're a vegetarian. Then you have my permission to not eat... but you must still come here to have a drink.  Also... their late night menu = AMAZING. omg."}
{"text":"9/22/13 My wife and I stopped in to the Tornado Steak House for a late dinner.  They have a half chicken with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and green bean special every  Sunday.  That's what I ordered.  It was wonderful.  My wife had the duck.  It's one of her favorite dishes when visiting.   I'm giving them 3 stars because of consistency issues.  Sometimes I love the food and other times not so much.  Last night was a good night!  Regarding service our waiter was eccentric at best.  That's all I'm going to say about that."}
{"text":"Tornado is my favorite place for steak, and one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. Everything that I've ordered has been perfect. Great mixed drinks and fine wines. The late night menu is wonderful--satisfying, and not too pricey. The service is very good. I love the authentic, old supper club vibe. It holds personal significance for me, as my great-great-aunt and great-great-uncle (Rudy Crandall) owned the place, when it was Crandall's, decades ago. I will be returning, hopefully very soon."}
{"text":"A traditional old Wisconsin steak house, with a comfortable atmosphere. Quite the best crab bisque I've ever had, and the walleye pike was scrumptious, with a tender crust and a  lemon, thyme, shallots & white wine sauce. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on numerous occasions over the years. And although it has been quite sometime since I have darkened the door step of this establishment, I must say that my opinion of it has not changed. It is a good steakhouse, but not a great one, and I personally believe it is undeserving of the rating it receives. A steak, fries, and asparagus can be a gastronomical event when prepared with the proper finesse. Unfortunately tonight's meal was merely a steak, fries, and asparagus. Apparently they were out of 'finesse'.  The server was quite attentive, the wedge and Roquefort salad was well done, and all of the food arrived at the proper temp and was properly prepared. I felt the wine pours were a little shy considering the per glass charge, and it would've been nice to have had some higher end wines available by the glass.  I arrived anticipating a much better meal then what I was served. And reminiscing of years ago when I more frequently visited this establishment, I recall feeling the same way every time. I so want to agree with the patrons that gush over this restaurant, but I just cannot. It is good, it is not great."}
{"text":"The steak sandwich was excellent as always, as was t he french onion soup, the service, and the atmosphere.  Unfortunately the cheese cake was obvisiously...and poorly frozen.  It tasted freezer burnt."}
{"text":"Reasons why I'm not a vegetarian: Tornado Steak House.  Reasons why I stay up past 10pm: Tornado Steak House.  Reasons why I always carry $13+: Tornado Steak House.  Reasons why you shouldn't go to Tornado Steak House right now:"}
{"text":"From the host, to the bartenders to our server( Margaret),  we had very friendly service last night! Great food and atmosphere and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ever since we moved to Madison over a year ago we've been wanting to try the Tornado Steak House. It gets great reviews and everyone raves about it. We've tried a handful of times but they were always already booked up.  Finally we were able to make reservations for 7:45 Friday night in mid-June. We were seated quickly after arrival. Our table was in the back corner. Everything is wooden and has a very stereotypical supper-club feel. I appreciated that they had the relish accouterments (carrot, celery, olive, cherry tomato, cucumber) in a high-ball glass. I like the originality.  Our server was prompt and friendly. She told us the specials. She made a comment that it was about time, so I had the impression the menu does not change very often. Speaking of the menu, this leads to one of my only two complaints. It was quite dark where we were. I think this is supposed to be romantic but I had to hold my menu up to the faint light to read.  My second complaint and this is the serious one, is it was ridiculously hot. They obviously know this is a problem and there were numerous fans blowing in our room. But where I was sitting there was no breeze. Twice I had to get up and walk outside to cool off. Sitting in the booth I couldn't stop sweating. This was the only downside to the evening but it was a big one.  Our beverages were unique and perfectly concocted. Our entrees were everything we heard they would be. I had venison and my partner had a filet. Perfectly cooked, excellent flavor, tasty sides.  I would go back and try the Tornado Steak House again but I don't think I would go during the summer months. The heat definitely skewed my experience and I'm lowering my rating because of it."}
{"text":"Well the bartender wasn't very successful at making a good drink but the other one could and was cool about it. Scallops were great and the farmers grass fed steak was good. I wouldnt say great. But for a grass fed it was very tender which is a feat in itself. Should have just went with their normal steak to see what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"I freaking loved this place a few years back. only reason no 5 star there was like a wired ammonia smell from somewhere. great charred chuck off meat man., and I like a good chunk of seared meat bro!"}
{"text":"I've always had good food and good service at the Tornado.  We hadn't been in several years and checked it out recently.  Still good.  I love that they bring you the relish glass and the tasty bread.  They also include a salad in the cost of the entree, which is nice and isn't always the case at higher end restaurants.  The food is excellent--steak, shrimp and walleye are all great.  The hash browns, though?  OMG!  Good!    The bar is very fun.  Laid back, dark and you feel like you are in an old school supper club."}
{"text":"Was quite disappointed in Tornado Steak House.  I always heard good things about Tornado so we decided to give it a try.  I was disappointed in the food--it was quite bland and tasted like any ol' steak and was just so-so. Nothing spectacular, nothing blew us away, except for the price.  If I am paying this much, then I want my food to be at least decent and this meal fell far below being decent.    There also seems to be quite a sketchy crowd that gathers out the front door smoking and carrying on...Not the best for business..."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! However; another disappointing evening at Tornado's.  We were placed in a small room with other couples and everything was great.  Then the staff seated a party of three older couples who were loud, drunk and foulmouthed.  The worst part is the staff continued to serve alcohol to these patrons thus the volume and profanity increased.  The room asked the couples to tone it down but we were told to F ourselves.  Their low class behavior was brought to the staff's attention.  The response was to serve the drunks more booze.  All we heard was about their bikes, 1940 Ford and what a co@$sucker Eddie Hale is. This is not the first time the staff has failed to control their patrons behavior at our previous visits. It is a shame because the food is great and if it were not for these out-of-towners everything would have been great.    Note to Staff: When you have patrons that are obviously drunk and can't control their behavior don't serve them more alcohol."}
{"text":"WOW....can I just say we picked this restaurant for our anniversary while staying up in Madison.  The idea of an old supper club atmosphere sparked my interest and steak of course it our favorite.  We loved the selection of steaks and cuts,  the unique vegetable arrangement in a glass of ice was a refreshing and light start to our experience. The drinks were very well prepared...my husband is a dirty martini connoisseur and was not disappointed.  The gin martini I had was unique and I don't remember the name but, have never had any thing like it...yum.  Dinner was truly amazing, flavorful and gave us both \"food coma\".  The shrimp cocktail was like no other...large and firm shrimp...great cocktail sauce!  Steak dishes we huge, flavorful and tasty.  The service was very nice...the waitress we had was a little over worked between our table and a few other bigger parties but, she had plenty of help getting water for us and anything we needed.  WE WILL be back....great meal and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wow... not for kids. Looks like a really old and dirty dive bar. No one came to help us.... probably a good college kid bar and steak."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Great atmosphere, and a really cool ilttle bar.  The food was superb.   We didn't have a reservation, but they were able to seat us right away.  Probably because the room they placed us in was filled by an uber-obnoxious group, about 3 sheets to the wind (drunk).  Even they couldn't. Ruin this wonderful meal. They start u with veggies and a generous bread plate.  Like almost all the places we went in Madison, they had excellent cocktails.  We ordered the frog legs (best I ever had) and the corn soup (yummy)to start. I ordered the sirloin, and it was great, one of the better steaks I've had.  My buddy got the rack of lamb.  It was excellent.  Luckily the portion was big enought o share.   A great place.  I wish I could give it 6 stars."}
{"text":"This place must hate me. I have been many times, the staff is always friendly but the food is a mess. I have never had a good meal here. I once took a date and they set us next to the window it was soooooo cold ice had built up on the inside. When asked to be moved they snubbed me, saying there were no open tables. I don't know what I'm missing. This place is right out of the 70's with bad food. Maybe one of these day I will get a good meal that my friends talk about until then I'm not going again unless asked."}
{"text":"Returned to Tornado's late night menu for a third time with a group of six. We ended up all getting up and leaving after ten minutes due to having an extremely unpleasant experience with a server there. We were given a gift certificate and were asked to return after a friend called in and expressed our feelings about that night. I returned for a fourth time, this occasion I was with a group of four. We started off each with a different cocktail. Those that stood out were the key lime gimlet and the other cocktail had strawberry and cucumber notes. I can't recall the name of the drink, but it was DELICIOUS. Very refreshing and light. For appetizers we had the scallops, two orders of the cocktail shrimp, and cheese curds. Everything was delicious. The scallops were nice. They are poached and in a white wine sauce. I thought it was fun to try something different versus the always seared, or bacon wrapped scallop. For entrees we all ordered the 8 oz sirloin steak, medium rare. Every steak was perfect. Seasoning was balanced well, temperatures were on point, and the meat was tender. For dessert, we basically got one of each. We had the cheesecake, the carrot cake, custard, a caramel bar of some sort, and the pineapple upside down. I thought most of the desserts lacked sweetness. However, it didn't matter to me because I was there to have my ultimate favorite, the pineapple upside down cake. It is the best dessert by far, and one of my favorite desserts that I've had at any restaurant in general. Our server that night was Aubrey, and she was wonderful. I know my table was constantly ordering things, but she was very patient and always attentive with us. I'm giving Tornado Room a five star rating not only for the excellent food, but also for the customer service. They really wanted us to come back and have a pleasant experience. This time we did get to enjoy Tornado Room, so thank you for your above and beyond customer service. Will be returning many more times."}
{"text":"The initial feels had me super excited. Great Yelp reviews, a feeling of being thrown back several decades when walking in, a friendly host, a fun display of cold veggies on the table, an and amazing looking bread plate....unfortunately, that's where it ended.  The biggest complaint is that it was SO incredibly loud, we literally had to yell to hear each other. We had a party of 3 and they sat us right in between 2 very large groups. By the time our dinners came, we just wanted to eat and get out because the volume just continued to rise.  I wish I could say that the meals made up for it, but I was left underwhelmed there as well. Escargot was good, frog legs tasteless. I will say that although salty, the french onion soup was good, and the boy toy's salad looked wonderful - great presentation.   We all ordered a steak and several different sides. Not one of us felt that our steak was anything special. Though cooked to perfection, totally flavorless. The side of asparagus was ok, baked potato was dry and seemed microwaved, and the hash browns were burnt to a crisp. I would also agree with other reviews that all our food took an unreasonable amount of time. We sat at 5:30 on a Monday, and ordered our food way before either of the large tables, so no excuses there.  Overall, I would only come back to try their late night menu, as I've heard great things about that and it sounds like it's a better value. (over $200 for our dinner)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Madison. Great food (I've had almost everything on the menu). They heat the plates, which is a nice touch because you can order a steak rare but still enjoy warm food. Relaxed, professional service.   The late night menu is a great bargain if you get the chance."}
{"text":"I've had a couple different things over the years, but the Bone in Rib Eye I had at my last visit still visits me in my dreams as being the steak all other steaks to be compared to!"}
{"text":"A really cool place that serves good waistline-expanding grub.  Had the 8 oz. filet, which was really tender and cooked perfectly.  One of my companions had a really tough, gristly NY strip, but our waitress removed it from the bill.  Service was as good as anywhere, and the hash browns could drive a nutritarian to the brink of unrepentant gluttony.  The bar in this place is a classic, old-school steakhouse-type slab of wood, dark and inviting despite being packed to the gills.  Thumbs way up."}
{"text":"We just got into town and we wanted to eat steaks as we heard great reviews.  We arrived about this evening at 8:00 pm.  As we entered, we asked if there was room for three and the guy in the front just said no, and you can seat yourselves in the bar. We were appalled with his arrogant tone of voice and response and didn't offer us the wait time.    We want to thank the guy for being very arrogant so we walked over couple blocks to Rare Steakhouse.  They gave us exceptional service, we ordered the 8 oz filet mignon, foie gras with pork belly, 22 oz ribeye, salad, three sides and two bottles of Pinot Noir. See my 5 star review of Rare Restaurant.  There was definitely no Aloha from Tornado!!!!! restaurant!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Clearly, you go here as much for the atmosphere as the food. The Tornado Room is classic 1950s--you kind of expect to see Dean Martin sitting in a booth near the bar. Our server was very good and efficient, although she was hampered by a slow bar throughout the night.  The food, while generally good, did have a couple of mis-steps. When one goes to a classic steakhouse, it is almost mandatory that you either order the wedge Caesar or the French onion soup.I ordered the soup, and it was served at a temperature that would be generously described as a lukewarm. The flavor was fine, but the temperature clearly left something to be desired. I'm not sure if it was simply under heated to begin with, or if it ended up sitting in the window for too long, but whichever was the case, it was a bit of a disappointment.  Whenever I go to a steakhouse, I tend to avoid the obvious menu choices. I am a firm believer that any competent kitchen can throw a high - quality steak on a high temperature grill and produce solid results. For me, the test of a good steakhouse is how they deal with less commonly prepared cuts. The beef menu at the Tornado Room does not offer much beyond the standard filet/strip/porterhouse mix, but they did have a marinated flank steak on the menu, so I decided to see what they could do with this. The steak was cooked perfectly, but whatever it was marinated in had no discernible flavor whatsoever. I never add salt or pepper to a steak until I have tasted it, as I prefer to trust that the kitchen knows how they want the steak to taste. In this particular case, the steak had clearly not been seasoned beyond what was in the marinade, and the flank steak required some seasoning help to reach optimal flavor.   All this said, I did find a Tornado Room to be an enjoyable experience. Next time, I'll make sure to try one of the more standard steak offerings and see what they do with it."}
{"text":"Great supper club place right off square and across from Park Hotel on the square. Late night shorts. 10:00-1:00!  A must place after theatre or later event. Most places close kitchen. They only close dinning room. Step back in time, decor is the sane look of the 50's. Must try brandy old fashion. Steak sandwich after 10:00 very satisfying as well as my salmon sandwich. We are coming back with the book to have owner sign and do earlier dinner maybe on patio."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect of this place, having come in from Denver for a few nights. But now, three weeks later, back home in Colorado, all I want is a restaurant like Tornado here. You walk in and it feels exactly like a Wisconsin restaurant--some German or Norwegian kitch for decoration, pine wood walls, small booths, and a personal/home feel. But wow. Food was great. And Madisonites, I hope you realize how great the prices are. I don't think you can get a well-made 10oz filet for less than $40 in any large city. Wedge salad was awesome and I would recommend along with the filet. Can't wait to go back the next time I have a conference there."}
{"text":"This is what a supper club/steak house should be. I always get the bone-in ribeye or the bone-in tenderloin depending on how hungry I am. Both are enough to satisfy you and leave you with leftovers. You must get the hash browns and French onion soup for your sides. Tornado Lounge is a must for any Madison visitor or resident. The late night menu is an extra bonus for a small city that lacks dining options after 10PM. I hold out on a fifth star for the drink menu and options. Get a world-class mixologist to spruce up the cocktail menu to get more critical acclaim!"}
{"text":"Good service with nice environment.  I recommend the French onion soup because it's very rich and love the cheese on top.  The steak was perfectly cooked: tender, juice and flavorful.  Last but not least, price is also reasonable (for what you get)."}
{"text":"A great, classic supper club atmosphere.  As soon as we sat down, we had veggies and bread to munch on.  I had the walleye with green beans and it was absolutely fabulous.  I wish they had a few more options that were less pricey, but I will definitely be returning as often as I can."}
{"text":"In Madison for the weekend visiting family and friends. One of our friends birthday and our anniversary. Our friends that are Madison residents raved about The Tornado and added that it is their favorite steak house. Well, nice atmosphere and feel when you walk in. All down hill from there. Had a reservation for 8pm, we were seated right at 8. Got menus, ordered drinks and then the wait began. Took quite a while to get drinks, ordered our entrees and waited even longer to get our appetizers and salads. It was around 9:45 when our meal was served. Almost everything was just warm at best. Several of us sent the food back and then it was hot but over cooked. For a high end restaurant it was very disappointing. We did not pay for our meal, our server apologized. What could and should have been a spectacular dinner was awful. The young man that filled our water glasses did an excellent job. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"This is where my husband and I go for special occasions, like our anniversary.  We can only afford to go here once or twice a year, but every time it is SO worth it.  So delicious!  Best steakhouse in Madison!"}
{"text":"Love the menu and the atmosphere.  Drinking in the bar area makes me feel like I'm on Mad Men.  Have been here just once - if I had the funds I would go back regularly.  Planning on going here for the next big \"celebration\" dinner.  I am a huge steak eater - my partner is not.  She found something on the menu (Coquille St. Jacques) that she also found delicious.  I recommend reservations - we went without and had to wait about 25 minutes."}
{"text":"I'd say the tornado was the essence of Wisconsin supper club but really most Wisconsin supper clubs are overpriced and bland in my experience only surviving by being the best place in the county to have a wedding reception or a fish fry.  Tornado has the same look and feel but their meat is generally much more flavorful and well prepared than the standard.  The huge bone-in rib eye is delicious, juicy and full of flavor.  The cocktails are strong and they make some of the more obscure classics well.    Generally had good service, even when ordering pretty damn drunk at 10:00."}
{"text":"Ever feel like donning a fedora and walking into an establishment where you could truly feel like Don Draper from Mad Men?  That is the Tornado Club Steak House.  My wife and I went there for the first time a few weeks ago on our anniversary.  While we waited for our table to be ready, we sat at the bar, which had the look and feel of a place that hadn't been touched since 1963.  Unlike a gross, greasy-spoon diner, this is not a bad thing.  It felt very classy and made for a great atmosphere.    Now, my go to cocktail is a simple Jameson on the rocks.  At a place like this I was prepared to pay $8-9.  Not so.  Instead, a more reasonable $5 price.  Impressive!  They also have a wide variety of martinis that I wasn't brave enough to try this night, but hope to soon.  As for the food?  Let's put it this way:  My wife, a filet mignon connoisseur, found the Tornado Club Steak House's far tastier than the uppest-scale member's only dinner clubs in Chicago we've been invited to.  It was very well seasoned and cooked to my wife's exact specification.  I had the salmon, which I'll admit was probably the best salmon I've ever had.  Again, perfect seasonings and cooked perfectly.  I have never been to a place that had a side for dinner of shredded hash browns.  Not only was this a smart choice for a side, but they give you practically a pound of potatoes, all well-seasoned.  Plenty of leftovers that re-heated perfectly with the next day's breakfast.  Word of caution:  Make your reservations early.  Calling even a day or two in advance will get you a Saturday night reservation of either 5:30 or 8:30.  Being the parents of small children, 8:30 would near our bedtimes.   Also, the deliciousness isn't cheap.  Prepare for a hefty bill.  Not \"oh my god I have to mortgage my house\" expensive, but it's going to cost more than your average dinner at Chili's.  But fear not, you definitely get what you pay for.  I definitely look forward to donning my fedora next time I come in, even if but for a drink."}
{"text":"absolutely best late night menu in Madison.  I have never been here before 10 p.m. but I can vouch for the food after that and it is fantastic.  I always get the cheese curds (best in Madison) and usually the wedge.  Yeah, yeah, I know, it's just iceburg lettuce; but the dressing, bleu cheese, bacon and croutons on this baby is legit.  I have also had the steak sandwich which is ridiculously huge and totally worth the $$.  My friends swear by the scallops but I do not eat that :(  Their drink menu is also extensive and fun and the service is friendly and quick.  Come late at night, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"As recommended by a friend and numerous locals - this place did not disappoint. We started out with cocktails at the bar. The drinks were fine but this is why my review is 4 stars - sitting AT the bar and we had the slowest service. The bartender not only served another couple before us (who sat down after us) but didn't seem to care that we were there at all. Once at our table, our server couldn't have been sweeter. (So service at this pricey restaurant doesn't seem to be a real problem.)   Each table is served a relish glass (literally a drinking glass filled with a variety of pre-dinner relish items) and a generous breadbasket. The 4 types of bread were all warm and fresh and I wanted to eat it all. So so good.   Our friend had recommended the scallops and I'm glad we got them. I've NEVER had scallops served this way and I'm still dreaming about them. The steaks came with a choice of sides and a choice of salad. It was all delicious and led to the steak that was perfectly prepared. How good was it? We don't usually take leftovers on vacation but this meat was so good we not only took it to the hotel but also brought it home with us. Yum."}
{"text":"When I walked in, I knew I would love the place. The bar is dark and classy. We ordered a few drinks while we waited for our table. The bartender was friendly and fast. We didn't think they were the best old fashioned we ever had but it was tasty just the same. The bread they bring out was great. Variety and they were all good. My favorite part was the wedge salad. It was amazing. All of us got steaks and they were A+!  All in all, go to this place. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great place! This is where I learned I do not like escargot nor frog legs, but besides that amazing steak and cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Tornado is a true and unadulterated, quality steak- and meat-house. You won't find another in Madison.  The first time I went here, it was late and I was very hungry, but I wanted everything on the menu and couldn't decide quickly. Our waitress came back to our table several times before I could finally settle down on what to order. That day, I had the venison and, boy, what a great choice! It was so juicy, so tender, so [fill in the blank with your favorite word that means the best thing ever]!  Since then, I've had the privilege of savoring Tornado's filet mignon, which just melts in your mouth, and their ribeye. I'm a tough judge on ribeye because it's my universally favorite cut of steak, but man it was good here! I wasn't big on the appetizers here, but the escargots were pretty good. If I ever get a chance to dine at this place again (I've moved now), I'd want to try the rabbit.   Final thoughts. The atmosphere is nice and the service is great as well. Tornado is pricey for sure, but it's worth the mouth orgasm that you'll pay for. Trust me, it doesn't stop until your prey safely and slowly makes its way down your esophagus and into your belly. You'll probably end up cheating on your favorite restaurant every so often."}
{"text":"I went here on Halloween with my boyfriend for a romantic, nice dinner.  We came in at about 6:30 pm and it appeared to be fairly uncrowded with many open tables. We were placed in a back room at a table for two.   We were given a good selection of bread, consisting of a dill bread loaf (I think), a biscuit and a sesame seed covered fresh, soft breadstick, with a big pat of butter. The bread was warm and good.   When you sit down, you get a glass of ice with fresh vegetables on a stick. I am still a little unclear as to whether it's supposed to be an edgy decoration, meant to symbolize temptation, or whether you can just eat it. We ate it, and it was good.   I ordered the key lime gimlet for the drink, which was the color of keylime pie, cold, came in a martini glass and had a graham cracker crust rim, with a fresh lime slice for a garnish. It was really delicious, sweet, creamy and tart.  For an appetizer, we ordered the scallops. They were very delicious. The sauce was rich and tasty. The scallops themselves were cooked well and were served over a bed of mashed potatoes in an actual shell (like from the sea).   I ordered the 8 oz filet for my entree. It was a good cut of meat, and had good seasoning on it. It was thick, juicy, and delicious. They served it on a hot metal plate upon a normal plate, and because the plate was still hot, it didn't cool off while I was eating it slowly to savor the taste.   My boyfriend ordered the lamb, and he liked it. I tried it and it was pretty good! He wasn't able to finish it, since it was a lot of food.  For my sides I ordered a mixed greens salad doused in a vinegarette and a baked potato. My boyfriend ordered the asparagus for his side.  We had a good server. We were initially seated in a room where there seemed to be a reservation for a group of 15, right next to the large group...not the best location to place a couple obviously on a romantic date when half the tables in the entire restaurant are empty. After the group got increasingly loud to the point where we couldn't hear each other without raising our voices and leaning in with straining expressions on our faces (not hot for a date), we asked to be moved if it was possible, and we were moved right away, no problems or fuss. Wonderful!  Here's the negative part of the review...these sides were nothing special. My baked potato was literally that. Just a potato with small side of sour cream. The asparagus were just steamed and set on a plate. I was annoyed that these sides were so bland and lackluster considering the price of the entree. Also, when we got the lamb boxed up, my boyfriend says it wasn't closed properly, so the lamb juice leaked out all over the car, his nice shirt and his kitchen floor.  So I give it a 4 stars. I'd go back, but not often due to the price."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the 4th.  At first we were a bit afraid of the atmosphere.  It is dark and older.  We were treated very well and the service was outstanding.  We ordered drinks.  The Cadillac old fashioned and the key lime gimlet.  Both drinks were great.  We had the shrimp cocktail, they were huge and the cocktail sauce had a bit of horseradish, very tasty.  For the entree we both had the special filet with peppercorn.  The meat melted in our mouth and the cognac mushroom sauce was fantastic.  The price was great for the quality.  We will be back next time to Madtown."}
{"text":"Incredible food, but elitist feel. You get 3 quality bread choices and a cup of veggies. There was so much food and I regret not taking home the leftovers. Can't go wrong with any dishes."}
{"text":"This is the probably the worst place ive ever eaten at. We got there after their dinner menu was done and we could only get the late night menu. The steak was so tuff my boyfriend's fork completely bent over trying to cut it.  My daughter had the same thing and it took her so long to chew one bite she was done eating.  If i would of came during \"normal\" menu time i would not of paid the bill!! No matter which menu was used if the quality of the meat is good it would not of made a difference. Save your money!"}
{"text":"Best steak in Madison. Crab bisque soup and wedge salad was fantastic! I liked the New York strip cut vs the special cut I got (can't remember what it's called but has the mushroom cream sauce). Overall, if your looking for some red meat/steak, check out Tornado."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it but I'm already drooling over the thought of my filet...everything about our meal was perfection! My family and I stopped by for a birthday celebration dinner and are excited to celebrate the next birthday, wedding, graduation, etc. there. Our waiter was friendly and attentive and gave great recommendations as it was our first time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Late night hunger too often results in desperate and embarrassing decisions:  Perkins, questionable street vendors...   Eating the entire tub of ice cream in my freezer...  But no more! The Tornado Room took a meal I barely want to admit I eat and turned into something I can't stop talking about.  Their late night menu is classy and delicious.  So have a house cocktail with a shrimp cocktail and say goodbye to midnight trips to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Just before Christmas, I took my mother to Tornado Steakhouse for a meal. It was her first time in Madison and I wanted somewhere special, yet quintessentially Wisconsin and I thought Tornado would fit the bill. I wasn't disappointed.  We had a 7:15 reservation and arrived early, so after check in we decided to start in the bar. I introduced her to the brandy old-fashioned, which I ordered for her sour and with olives -- she loves olives. Mine was the same, but with fruit. Very good, and the bartender was polite, professional, and cheerful -- he cared for his job and obviously enjoyed what he did, and the results showed in his drinks. It was a pleasure to watch him work.  Starters were a spinach salad for me and French onion soup for her; these were accompanied by complimentary bread and crudites. The bread was quite good and accompanied by quality fresh butter. Crudites were serves in a chilled mug filled with ice...imagine a Bloody Mary, with no vodka or tomato juice. The vegetables were good quality but the actual process of eating them was somewhat fussy due to the presentation. We also had to ask for some dressing to dip them in.   My salad was a large and fresh portion with excellent warm bacon dressing. It was very good. However, my mother's French onion soup was so sweet as to be inedible. Despite the good crouton, good cheese and generous onions, the broth was downright sugary and she was not interested in finishing it. To be honest, two sips of the broth was all it took for me to write it off. It was not good and I would not order this.  Her main was the rack of lamb and mine the 20 oz. bone in tenderloin. She gave me a bite of her lamb and it was out-of-this-world excellent; just absolute perfection on every level. Every aspect from the meat to the sauce to the presentation was great. My tenderloin was one of the richest steaks I've had and was cooked precisely on the rare side of medium-rare, as I requested. Whoever is running the grill back there is top notch as they nailed both the lamb and the huge tenderloin in doneness we requested precisely. Great job!  Hash browns were tasty and large enough for me to share with her. The asparagus stalks were quite fat which worried me initially, but each onewas cooked well and of high quality without any woody texture or stringy-ness. Quite nice!  We were far too stuffed for dessert and even if we weren't, the dessert menu was heavy and fair at best.   Service was pleasant, attentive, and unintrusive. It was refreshing to be at a steakhouse with both male and female servers; I think it's interesting that I didn't really notice or think of that until typing this review. I wonder why other places don't follow suit?  Tornado was a good experience. I plan to return and sample some other items; it's not often you see rabbit on a menu and there is a wide variety of promising dishes on the spread. Recommended without hesitation."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere amazing steak (and super cheap on their late night menu). The drinks there are tasty yet strong...also their French onion soup is divineee. My only complaint is that service is slow for late night food. I haven't been there for regular dinner, so not sure how service it's during that. Definitely worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"I am in love with the late night menu (served from 10 p.m. until 1 a.m.), particularly the steak sandwich. I get the horseradish cream on the side so I can control the amount. But man, is that thing good! And the price is right (they just raised it to $9 from $8.50).  The onion rings are also incredibly delicious. I'm not a huge fan of onion rings in general, but they really do it right. They are thin slices of onion and the batter is light and crispy.  On weekdays (Mon-Thurs.) they also have $2 off their specialty cocktails. I've tried several now and one of my faves has a pepper rim and green chile vodka.  The ambiance is pretty fun as well -- dimly lit, with cozy booths. It can get kind of packed, depending on the day. But it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Great supper club dining experience. I suggest reservations even in a weekday. Their cocktails are overall very good. If normal dinner is out of your range, I suggest their late night menu which had their steaks at an more affordable price. Their onion rings are also amazing."}
{"text":"I'll be brief, because Tornado Room's late night menu is a legend throughout Madison.   The steak sandwich is great, especially for the price. My dining partner and I each ordered a steak sandwich, and split an order of steak fries.   The service is phenomenal. Very genuine and friendly staff. One of my favorite parts of the meal is filling out a postcard from the restaurant which they will send out on your behalf (free of charge!) a really fun touch. :)   Pro tip: The perfect cocktail to accompany this dining experience is a dirty martini."}
{"text":"What?   I go to the tornado every year when I come t Madison.  Really look forward to the retro atmosphere great steaks and friendly service.  This year, well the atmosphere is still the same but man... Sooooooooo disappointed.   My steak was \" killed\" way way over cooked and the server even agreed within a second .  But then 45 minutes after she left to get me a new one ,,, well it never even showed up...  Had to leave it had been over an hour and a half since we arrived .And the sides served were stale, cold and tasteless .. Even the caesar was off.   So had to write it up.   I see a few other bad reviews so hope it's not a trend !!!"}
{"text":"In the year of the Mad Men, Don Draper could do no better than this. I lived in Madison for years and only now do I realize the sex appeal that is the Tornado Club.   Low, low lights and enveloping leather booths. Huge goblets for my crimson red wine. A hot, humid summer night. Take this review as you will, I didn't eat anything, but I drank plenty. My best friend who was with me eats burgers there late at night; she vouches for their quality.    Draper could have been in the booth next to me with a dirty martini and a bloody fillet, and I wouldn't have batted an eye."}
{"text":"Haven't had the food (yet) but I did have one of the best Brandy Manhattans I've ever tasted. Love the ambiance!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to find a tried and true restaurant near the Capitol. We are SO glad we stopped here. Everything on the menu looked good, and I'm sure it all is amazing. I had the Venison and it was to die for. One of the best pieces of meat I've ever had. A definite must!"}
{"text":"Third time here. Excellent steaks. Excellent cocktails. Old school with high quality food and service. Worth the money and a great place to chill and enjoy a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Well if you are in Madison, Wisconsin and want a steak, this would be the place to come. The ambiance gives you a high end vibe. Service was great. Definitely more of a date spot or a business meeting place. The Menu is kind of what you'd expect of a steakhouse??Yea they got Steak, and its pretty good, I didn't yelp the first time I came here so no pics of my first trip here. So this being my second time coming here, I decided to venture out away from ordering the steak. This time around the food took a while to come out,maybe they were just super busy but on to the food! I ordered  Movie star(drink)- to watered down, felt like a cheap mix drink.(could have ordered the wrong ones)  Cream of mushroom soup- this lacked a kick in the flavor that I prefer but it wasn't bad  Braised Fennel - this was great, quite unique taste to it. Never had braised fennel before.  Broiled Jumbo Shrimp- Well worth the wait, Imagine if red lobsters Garlic shrimp scampi but with real shrimp and real flavor ? lol joking .This was awesome, the Shrimp tasted fresh even though we were here in the middle of Wisconsin. The flavor was on point.  Desert- Chocolate Caramel Cashew Tart- Flavor was good but too many nuts in this lol, it kind of  overpowered the flavor of chocolate.  Still I would come back not the best restaurant in Madison, but it definitely has a distinct vibe separating it from the rest of restaurants in Madison. The Entrees are always phenomenal here. Could have been 5 stars but for the price, bad drinks, mediocre dessert, I will keep it at 3."}
{"text":"One of the best steak places I have visited. Definitely get the scallop appetizer and the ribeye on the bone. I ordered the hash browns on the side because everyone on Yelp was raving about them but I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"The BEST steak I've ever tasted. Everything was delicious....the drinks stiff, the salad and soup perfectly made. It was a lovely meal and I expected the Rat Pack to show up any second with all the wood & original decor :)"}
{"text":"This place harkens back to a '50's era steak house and bar where women wore gloves for an evening out and the men discussed the space race while watching the Kennedy Nixon debates.  The Tornado is so dimly lit it takes a moment to adjust, even when entering at night. We sat at the bar for a late night burger. It was after midnight and our bartender from 2 blocks away told us to come here for a late night meal. They have a late night menu from 10am to 1am that is value oriented for the late night crowd. The bartender/server was professional in appearance and demeanor. I had a Smoked muenster burger with fried shallots and Russian dressing. Huge and juicy.  Next time in Madison I want to start my night here and sample the regular menu - I will spend a few more dollars but if the burger is an indication, the steaks must be incredible."}
{"text":"Not worth the cost. I took a team from my company for dinner there tonight after hearing great reviews from a client. The NY strip was too thick to be enjoyable... ironic, I know.  5 of us ordered this and all agreed that it was way to tough. The dining area was loud, and we couldn't talk at a normal level.  Service was great, bread and salads were delicious, but the overall experience was poor. One coworker ordered the filet and said it was wonderful. That was the only positive feedback before we hurriedly left the noise.  Had the price been half of what they charged, I would have given a higher rating, but it is definite not worth the price for a full dining experience."}
{"text":"As a visitor, I was NOT impressed by the State St. bar scene. Way too college-y for me. Then, my brother and I stumbled upon the Tornado, which was near my hotel and it was awesome!  Inventive cocktails, great service and super-duper ambience! We also shared a salad, which was too heavy on the dressing, but yummy nonetheless.   If I lived in Madison, this would be my go-to bar/lounge/hangout."}
{"text":"I was in Madison on business, and our local host (who is not a Wisconsin native) wanted us to experience a classic Wisconsin supper club. I didn't really know what that meant, but I'm always up for a new dining experience. the combination of a \"white tablecloth\" restaurant with the log cabin/lodge decor was surprising, but was very fun. We had a cozy little booth, which made for a great environment for conversation without the need to shout like you do at so many restaurants. Our waitress was super friendly and made a great wine recommendation for us. I had the 8 oz filet and it was cooked to perfection! I also started withe the crab bisque, which was delicious. I had a great meal and a got a good taste of a Wisconsin institution - a great combination for a perfect night out!"}
{"text":"Awesome old fashioned supper club service, steak was amazing!  Cocktails were really good too.  There are few restaurants today that offer this level of service. Can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"You're downtown, the temperature is dropping to like negative 1,000, but that alcohol you consumed at that one bar is keeping you somewhat warm. You're on a trek to find something to coat your stomach, yet everything is closed or has stopped serving food. In the midst of your crisis, you are told by your friends that  through the grapevine, or yelp for that matter, they heard Tornado Steakhouse serves a late night menu. And a great one at that.  There's something life changing about eating a perfectly grilled sirloin steak at 12am. Especially when it's in a restaurant designed to a tee in the antiquity of days now long ago. The lights are dim, and the mood warm and intimate. It's perfect for a date, as long as they're paying.  This restaurant is a little pricey, but it's very understandable as they serve some quality food. Their frog legs are sauteed in some delectable brandy, garlic and honey. The french onion soup I could eat for days. And, for the price, you get a humongous portion when you order an entree. I found the bill more than fair.  Not only is the food great, the service is equally excellent. All of the waitstaff work so well as a team. Everything is done in an uniform motion, but with grace."}
{"text":"I liked the funkiness of the interior, though it might not be to everyone's liking. The lighting could sure be improved.   But you come here for the food, right? No worries there. If you crave the old school steakhouse experience, you will be really happy. First. Attention to detail. Couple of choices on bone-in steaks, which earns points in my book. And radishes in the crudités! Second, they butcher a little bit thicker than the norm. A bone-in Rib Eye was almost 2 inches thick. That's just greatness.    As such, portions will seem large. Entrees come with soup or salad, and a potato or vegetable side. They are not meager. Nor are the appetizers. Be really hungry if you intend to order off that menu as well, or be prepared to take steak home.   Meat will come in the desired temp - they executed that really well. Well seared crust. Would have let it rest another 5 minutes myself, but it came out sizzling on a plate.  Care is taken with scallops and shrimp were tender chilled crescents of delight. A bread tray is brought to the table, but it ranges from good biscuits to a mediocre bread machine loaf. They'd be better off buying in from Madison Sourdough. Still, I ate it.   The wine list is quite competent, if not showy, and that itself is an accomplishment. Servers are about what you find in Madison; folksy friendly but sloppy on the water pour. I enjoyed them regardless. If I could improve on the experience, I'd hire a lighting designer, buy bread out and get a good cleaning service to scrub the floors which seemed a little dingy along the edges.   I'd go back. And definitely ask for the red banquette."}
{"text":"The food was so good that I don't want to brush my teeth for a month at the off chance a fleck of meat might drop on my tongue"}
{"text":"This place is supposed to have the best steak in Madison.  It is very good, but I'm not sure it's the best.  My date got the $37 special for the night...a very thick steak, beautiful cut of meat.  The only problem is that he ordered it well (I know, we won't be going out again!) which meant that the outside was almost charcoaled but the inside was still pink!  I got rabbit ($18) in a portabella wine sauce which was very good.  Portions are definitely generous!  The service was fantastic. They seemed to have a girl whose sole purpose in life was to fill water glasses...as soon as I took a drink she was there to fill it up again!  Our main waitress was very attentive and they place had a good crowd even on a Wednesday night!  I've also been here for drinks before, which was fun...the waitresses are very friendly...which might have been because we came with cute boys, but who knows?"}
{"text":"I think this place is wonderful. They bring this strange relish thing to the table, yes you can eat it. It's raw carrots, celery, a radish, a tomato, a cucumber, two olives, a green onion and a pickle. Then they bring home baked bread To the table which is quite good. I've tried both the French onion and their chicken noodle soup. Their French Onion is great. Their  chicken noodle is amazing but it's a teeny tiny portion. I absolutely LOVE their flank steak. It's a large portion for a great price served with the option of potato or vegetable. And it's delicious. I absolutely love it. Their service is amazing across the board (wait staff wise). I've yet to have a bad server here. If you are seated on the patio it is a little warm because it's like in an alcove. And people from the corral room downstairs love to go outside and smoke a bunch of cigarettes but it isn't unbearable, it's just obnoxious. The dining room is very dimly lit, and it has poor cell phone reception, but you don't go to a restaurant like this to be on Snapchat."}
{"text":"I returned here on a Tuesday night afterwork. I won't go into the atmosphere since I described that in my first post. This time I decided to try the bison ribeye, which was really good. Tender with mushrooms / sauce that was delicious. The only reason I didn't give this review a five was due to the fact that although my entree was good, I don't believe the meat was cooked enough to fully render all of the fat. That being said I did order the steak rare, so partially my fault. If I were to order this item again I'd probably order medium rare. My colleague ordered the smaller of the filets, which I tasted and that was fantastic!  I'm not sure how busy it gets on later week nights, but since they do take reservations you might as well make one prior to going just to be safe. Both times I went here we were able to make reservations the day of."}
{"text":"I hesitated writing a bad review for Tornado because it's always had good ratings but we were not impressed with the food on this trip. We had reservations but had to wait twenty minutes or more and the bar was full so had to stand around by the back door. We were finally seated but the service was slow (it was busy as usual) and it was a long wait between courses. Our server was excellent so apparently the kitchen was overwhelmed and just couldn't keep up with the demand.. The ice berg wedge salad was very good but by now it's getting late and we were getting a little cranky. Nine thirty or so and we still haven't got our steaks, our reservations were for 7:30. When I finally got my New York strip I found it was not only tough but someone decided to put a garlic spice on top that completely overwhelmed the meat. It managed to leak into my hash browns and ruin the tase of that as well. Yuck!  It was so late my now I gagged down what I could and left the rest. It was too late to send it back and I didn't make a fuss. A forty dollar mistake. My wife got a tenderloin and it too had a spice of cracked pepper and stuff on top but not the garlic. It was excellent. (Two of us got the New York strip and they were both the same as I described)  So, we were not impressed and it will be a long time before we go back. Certainly not on a weekend. There are better places."}
{"text":"First time there last week and I couldn't have been more satisfied.  We sat in the lounge for dinner and it was elegant and intimate.  The service was average but sufficient, but it didn't matter because the food and atmosphere were exactly what we were looking for- ample portions, one of the best steaks I've ever had, and a salad and side included, which is a nice addition that differs from many other steak houses in town (Johnny Delmonicos, Flemings, and others), all in a dark, cozy Wisconsin supper club.    I haven't heard of anywhere else in town that can top the Tornado Room in terms of value, taste, and location."}
{"text":"This place is retro cool and has the added bonus of great food. The paneling is awesome as are the light fixtures, the bar and the bar booths. Plus I love the Walleye and the Duck."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check out their late night menu for the longest! I finally found myself in the area starving at 10:15pm and knew it was time to scope out Tornado's.   I ordered the steak sandwich and salmon burger. The salmon burger was really good, but I eat a lot of salmon burgers and it didn't wow me too much. However, ommmmgggg the steak sandwich is to die for! The steak was thinly sliced and stacked quite high. The sandwich came with a dipping sauce that paired excellently. The ambiance in the bar area was perfect.  The area was dimly lit with table seating on the side of the bar. The service was also very good."}
{"text":"Awesome place for late-night drinks. Service was great, and our server, Christen, was charismatic and friendly. The atmosphere was excellent and we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in there. Always great service, excellent cocktails, and delicious late hours menu. Oh and nice comfy chairs and seating too."}
{"text":"Great cocktails!  Brandy old fashioned was a work if art.  Salad was great, but steak was completely forgettable.  The bar is highly recommended"}
{"text":"The drink I was served wasn't even the right recipe. The bartender insisted it was right even thought I told him it was not right...I should know I only get it every where I go. I think his name was Tom. Think he was on drugs or something. Overall very rude and I will not be going back to this establishment because of him. Didn't even order food the experience was so bad. Johnny del'monico for me from here on out."}
{"text":"I concur with Matt M. about this restaurant.  Read good things about it and wanted to like it but the food was just not good. Soup was bland. Baked potato was almost cold, hard & chunky when it should be fluffy, hot & fall apart easily.  The filet..sigh..I was so looking forward to a melt in your mouth, perfectly cooked steak from a high end steak house. It might have been melt in your mouth if the cook (I won't say chef since everything but the bread and uncooked shrimp cocktail were poorly done.) could have gotten the tempature right. I felt awful but had to send it back twice and just gave up after the second time. The tempature isn't just the literal temperature but the texture INSIDE the the steak as well. Medium rare shouldn't look and feel like a semi raw muscle but be cooked all the way through to a bright reddish pink where you cut into it and it's so juicy it bleeds.  This was still looking and feeling like muscle.  A real shame since it felt like it would have been tender if prepared properly to my tastes.  On the plus side, my server was excellent.  She was attentive and apologetic when the steak wasn't working out.  Took the steak off my bill and offered desert.  Although now that i think of it, nowadays most restaurants have their manager come around even when everything is going well.  So very disappointing that no one other than my server checked on me.  Especially with an issue.  Overall just a disappointing experience when I WANTED to be able to like it so much.  The stars it gets are because of my server."}
{"text":"This is a place to definitely make reservations for.  While I enjoyed the food and service,  i expected a bit more for the price.  My friend and i were seated in a back room which housed the large parties.  We had to yell to order and couldn't hear each other throughout the meal.  Sitting outside would have been the better option.  The meal starts with fresh vegetables and several homemade breads.  Great wine selection.  We both had prime rib.  Mine was a bit overcooked.  My vegetable side was too salty,  my friends hashbrowns are undercooked.  The Giant bread muffin that it came with melts in your mouth.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I haven't even been here for dinner yet, and I know it is one of the best in Madison.  I went in for a late night snack and was very happy to see that the steak sandwich was only $9. The meat was so incredibly tender and juicy. The cocktail I ordered was very well-made, as well.  I can't wait to go here for dinner some time. Perhaps I'll bring a date with me."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Went there with a bunch of friends and had a great time.  We were 20 minutes late and felt really bad about holding up the table, but they were very gracious and seated us all and didn't hurry us.  I ordered the 8 oz filet and it was cooked a perfect medium rare.  Really the best steak I've had in years and definitely the best in Madison.  Yummy sides, too.  The service was top notch -- from the bartender to our waiter to the food runners.   It doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't be fooled.  Inside the bar and the dining rooms are pretty nice.  Good lighting, lively atmosphere.    It's expensive, but TOTALLY worth it."}
{"text":"Trip back in time, legit supper club, very rat packy  Stopped in for dinner on a Saturday and were seated in the Corral room.  Very retro vibe.  Friendly and attentive waiters.  Started out with the brandy old fashioned. very nice start.  Liked the bread stick and the vegetables.  Had the beer cheese soup, which was ok.  I thought it had a bit of a burned taste and didn't really like the flavor, I've noticed this before with some other beer cheese soups.  Had the 8oz Fillet as the entree.  Wow.  Served on a sizzling plate from the oven.  Delicious, very tasty, a memorable steak.  Would definitely go back.  And to Heidi B - there is such a thing as the internet which among other things lists menus, so you don't have to rely on word of mouth about the menu.  In fact both the Tornado website and this very website list their menus, why were you confused about the menu and its prices being \"different than what you were told\" and then why do you review a place that you haven't eaten at?"}
{"text":"Old school setting and great service help overcome an uneven menu. My onion soup was unremarkable, lukewarm  and didn't have much of a crust. However, the venison was amazing (medium rare). Unfortunately the Brussels sprouts that came with were undercooked.   We ordered multiple desserts and the standouts were the lemon tart and especially the chocolate caramel tart.   PS - did try a companions hashbrowns and those rocked as well!"}
{"text":"Used to be one of our favorite places.   We drive up from Chicago.  Last night was not a good experience.  They offered to make a grilled cheese for my 2 1/2 year old and proceeded to charge us $15 for it .  I am not cheap but that is ridiculious!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested this supper club as a \"taste of Madison\" for my first visit to the city/state. We had the BEST meal there. Our server was great, we did not have to wait for a table (sometimes even though I've made a reservation I still have to wait) and the food was AMAZING. We had the scallop appetizer which was the best scallop dish I've ever had.  Our wonderful server recommended eating the greens that we thought were just decoration/garnish.  It was delicious! Then we shared the lamb and the prime rib.  Huge portions.  We were able to share and take some home. The lamb came encrusted with a horseradish/wasabi and a sweet red wine sauce. The rib-eye was traditional, but cooked exceptionally well. I also recommend the Brandy Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"Average and sometimes ill-prepared steaks, best late-night menu in Madison, classy place with excellent service.   I've had the t-bone and the strip. Nothing wrong with either, though the t-bone was a little 'blue' near the bone, and the strip inexplicably lacked marbling or robust flavor. They're not especially seared or charred, not overly seasoned, and not 'prime'. So what you end up with is a fairly large, not terribly priced steak that's unfortunately a little bland.   That said, I think their hash browns, which come in a strange circular pillow formation, are just about the best hash browns I've ever had, and this is compared to literally dozens of other interpretations over the years. I also like their bread basket, almost certainly the best in town. They also have amazing burgers and steak fries after 10pm.  Not positive that I'd recommend this place unless someone wanted good atmosphere and a seriously large chunk of cow...and wasn't too picky."}
{"text":"I can't begin to express my disappointment. I'm not a regular, but have been here many times and for the most part look forward to coming back.  Tonight.... not so much. Worst service ever and not just here but anywhere!  Our Waitress worked her darnedest to, make service at MacDonalds look good.  My steak had a nasty smell and an even worse flavor.  I had one bite and would have sent it back but she never came back to ask how our meal was. I could have left without paying but went to the bar and waited.... still no Waitress.  So, I went to the hostess desk and told them who I was and that I was waiting in the bar for the bill. Finally she showed up, I told her my displeasure with the steak, which she took off the bill. Not tip for her other than to say she should find a welding job because being a waitress wasn't where she should be.  It will be a struggle to go back."}
{"text":"Still consistently amazing!   Tara has been a great server over the years, you are lucky if you get her, tip well.   The dinner menu is great, try the rabbit, or dry aged steaks.   The late night menu keeps delivering year after year, and the scallops are still the best in the midwest."}
{"text":"This place is a must...One of the best steaks I've ever had, one of the best meals I've ever had.  I personally  recommend eating in the hip lounge area if your a small group,  the dining room doesn't do this place justice."}
{"text":"Due to a combination of both it being my first time travelling for work and me just being the utter most forgetful person ever, promptly after dining at this fine establishment, I forgot my receipt at the table. This was also after being THOSE patrons who ask for separate (from each other, and separate tabs for food and alcohol) AND itemized checks. Hate on me now, I deserve it. I intended to eat the cost of my meal and forget trying to get reimbursed for it, but figured it would be worth a shot to give the restaurant a call and see if they'd email me my receipt. They couldn't, but what they could do is mail a copy of my receipt to my home address (!!!!)  Long story short, I returned home a week later but didn't expect much. But lo and behold, to my surprise was an envelope from Tornado Steak House. My receipt, and even a postcard! Sweeeeeet. My impression of this place from our dining experience was already great, but their phenomenal above and beyond service just makes this restaurant even more awesome!  Anywho, this was our first meal in Madison and we came based on a recommendation by a friend and we were absolutely starving. So we had no idea what to expect, and walked in sans reservations. Luckily we were early and were able to snag a table, but do make reservations if you plan on coming during the typical dinner rush because our section was packed by the time we left! The vibe of the restaurant is very classic steakhouse, dimly lit and a little romantic with illuminated (real!) candles at each table. Service was spectacular and so accommodating from beginning to end, even though like I mentioned, we were literally the most annoying guests ever with our multiple check requests. (Sorry!)   I totally skipped getting any other appetizers and promptly told the waiter I'd have the 16 oz New York Strip. Good thinking, since all the steaks DO come with a salad (or a soup, I think) as well as your choice of a side! I think for ~$30 and some change, this is a great value since some places will charge you that much or even more for just an ala carte steak! The salad was pretty standard, but nice, crisp and fresh. There are a nice handful of options for sides you might find at any typical steakhouse (potatoes and the like) but I made an oops by choosing the roasted veggies, because apparently my tastebuds hate endives. The roasted veggies do change seasonally, so I'll make a note to skip endive season in the future. The star of the show of course was the steak, which was of gargantuan proportions. As much as I tried, I wasn't even able to tackle half of that thing! Really delicious though, and cooked to medium rare perfection, as I requested.  The veggie appetizer you're presented with upon sitting down is pretty cool, although we had no idea WTF it was at first. And they have a nice variety of house breads too, but I'd say skip the bread and save the stomach real estate for your entrée, you'll need it!"}
{"text":"It's been almost a year since we last came here and had a terrible experience, so we decided enough time had passed and we can give it another go.  We walked up to the hostess stand and she was on the phone. From our previous review of this place, that didn't end well. Luckily, she hung up the phone quickly and greeted us warmly, stating she'll seat us in less than 5 minutes.  We started out with the frog legs....which was interesting. It wasn't a bad taste, but once was enough. The sauce it was drenched in was pretty good though.  He had the Filet Au Poivre....10 oz sirloin with peppercorn and mushroom sauce...or something like that. He loved it, and the bite I got was also tasty. He was pleased it was cooked exactly to his liking (MEDIUM). He was also pleased about the tenderness of the meat.  I had the 8oz sirloin and it had a random huge onion ring on top of it. It had more breading than the actual onion itself, so I set it aside for the boyfriend to eat. My steak didn't have all the sauce and hoopla, but still good. The only thing I wasn't happy about was struggling to slice some pieces of it with a knife.   Our server was very nice as well. She deserved to be tipped twice. =)  Happy we gave this a second chance. Will definitely put this restaurant back on our list."}
{"text":"This place never fails!!! Perfect date night place, or place to bring your parents to prove you've \"made it\" Best steaks in town, great service, plenty of wine to choose from, huge portions! Pricey? Maybe. Worth it?? Yes!!!"}
{"text":"Simply overrated! Money well spent somewhere else! Ordered a T bone steak medium rare but got it well done. Very expensive for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I had to come here for a client dinner ... Right when they said steak house I was sad.. I was pretty sure I couldn't eat anything here because I was vegetarian... I called in ahead of time and asked if they had options because I didn't see anything on the menu .. and voila they said they can do something for me .. they did scalloped potatoes and this fancy pants vegetable dish .. it was great.. I also had the cheese platter .. it was a A+ in my books"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Head in there for the late night menu if you can swing the hours...... I don't want to give too much away because I think it's a really powerful/romantic place to enjoy a meal, so if you're considering going- definitely go."}
{"text":"We chose this place for the combination of  steaks and seafood. To my surprise they offered venison which I paired with a potato pancake. My tip when ordering venison is to simply let the chef prepare, never choose a doneness, I was so overwhelmed with the perfection of the preparation, I talked about it the rest of the night. The rest of our party of 8 had steaks, salmon, and shrimp, all of which were large portions and done properly. Don't be impatient for the meals to arrive, they will show up proper.  Cold vegetables , radish, cucumbers, olives, and more served complimentary keep you busy while drinking great wines and chatting."}
{"text":"Got The oysters and they were so bad ! :( Otherwise nice place  Stakes are pretty good"}
{"text":"Overall it is a bit on the pricier side. The frog legs were not that great as touted out to be but the steaks were awesome !"}
{"text":"LOUD atmosphere at regular dinner time, excellent filets, service OK--server was really anxious.  This is an all-wood-paneling-sound-travels type of place. Initially, we couldn't hear each other talk. We could clearly hear the booth Across the dining room from us; lots of echoing at the Tornado. The booth next to us had 4 loud boomers that yell when talking and were singing at one point, but we hadn't been here before so we stayed.  Not the place for a quiet birthday dinner. I mentioned it was my husband's birthday when I made the reservation, they don't do anything special, unlike Delaney's on the west side which makes birthdays really special.  Food: Filets were perfectly cooked. The filet au poivre was bland. Brussels were undercooked, asparagus was crisp tender. Included salad and bread was nice touch.  If you are in the mood to get loud and remember the past, go here.  For a quiet celebration, keep looking.  I'll probably try again only for late night.."}
{"text":"Our son took us here  on Nov 5, 2011.  Called for reservations on Tuesday Nov. 1 for reservations for four.  Had a choice of 5:15 or 9:15.  Took 5:15.  When we arrived it was pretty empty but within  a half an hour it was getting full.   Very dark. Lots of wood. Jazz music playing.   Husband and son had the specialty cut, 20 oz. Bone-In Tenderloin (46.00) Wedge salad/ baked potato.   Both said it was the best steak they ever had. Done medium perfectly.  I had the broiled shrimp ($23.00)   French onion soup $1.50 extra. Very bland/ zucchini   Daughter had the Walleye ($22.00) Caesar salad/ baked potato. Best walleye she has ever had.  For dessert we had: Flour less chocolate Cake, Chocolate Carmel Tart, Pineapple upside Down Cake. $8.00 each.   Great attentive staff. Could use brighter bulbs in lamps by tables.  Woman's bathroom very old looking but clean"}
{"text":"Pretty good old school supper club. I went there Saturday and called friday for a reservation and was told it was my lucky day they just had a 6:30 cancel and I could have that spot or it would be after 9pm before I could get in. I  said great but 6:30 would be close and the response was as long as you within 10 minutes you will be good. We really wanted a 7 or 7:30 reservation. So We were able to arrive at 6:15 check in and said we would like a cocktail at the bar 1St and they responded by saying we will come get you in 15. I responded could you give us 20 minutes. His response I will get you in 15. Hmmm not very friendly. They were very slow and I noticed multiple customers walking in with no reservation being told they could be seated at 7:00 and or 7:30. Hmmmm again that was when we wanted. I guess they fooled me and got me to do what they wanted. So much for trying to be a good customer planing ahead.  In fact as I write this review I'm contemplating my 3 star is way to good and will be changing it to a 1 based on how customer service treated us. we rushed to make it on time and early and there was no need to. Tricked again I guess."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Tuesday evening. We spent some time in the bar area before our dinner was ready and the bartender was pleasant and conversational. Drinks we're made quickly and efficiently. For dinner I had the filet with a wedge salad and asparagus. All were prepared perfectly and delicious. No complaints with anything."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've eaten here, but I have the utmost respect for the bartenders here. It is not hyperbole to say that you could travel the world over and not find yourself a more perfect bloody mary. Watch how many ingredients they put into it. Notice that time after time, no matter who makes it, it never disappoints.  The bartenders here are bartenders in the true classic sense, not 'mixologists' or snotty hacks in the back pocket of the orange bitters lobby (see also Bourban and Branch in SF)...This same quality is found in all their drinks. This place is a real class act."}
{"text":"We came to Tornado on a Friday night on a whim with no reservation so didn't have very high hopes of being seated- but why not try?!  There was room at the bar and from there one of the small bar booths opened up quickly- perfect!!    We ordered a shrimp cocktail to start and it was fine- no frills and 5 jumbo shrimp.  We then got a bread basket and while the large breadstick was delicious, the small loaf was impractical and challenging to eat.  I ordered the sautéed perch special and my husband had a steak.  For sides we had yellow beets and hash browns.  I didn't try his steak but my dinner was delicious...especially from a place specializing in steak.  I was really impressed with how light the coating/breading was and the yellow beets were delicious!!  We will try our seating tactic again soon as it super fun to people watch in the bar!  Thanks Tornado!"}
{"text":"My wife and I hit this place up for a dinner date. Amazing food and the atmosphere is like a Northwoods supper club, but with class. Kind of a throwback to the Rat Pack days.  We enjoyed an amazing shrimp cocktail with a bottle of wine for dinner.  Both of us had the special, which was a Wisconsin Grass-fed Beef 16oz steak and it was amazing. Just like a normal supper club, they throw tons of food at you. Next to my great steak was a baked potato and soup. Plus there is bread on the table as well.   And, they got my steak just the way I ordered. That's a big thing for me is the cooking of the steak. If I say medium, I want medium, not medium well or medium done, medium. And they got it perfect, compared to some of the other places in town.  This is a great place to have a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"The bartender says it has been open since 1996!  Did not know about this place until about 3 years ago and finally got the chance to go today.  This has an old 1960's typical Wisconsin supper club feel.  We had prime rib with yorkshire pudding  and filet au poivre.  These steaks are well presented, perfectly done and taste wonderful!  Our server knew her menu items well.  The fresh baked bread and butter was melt in your mouth.  The wine and cocktail selection is extensive. Compliments to Tornado!"}
{"text":"Q: \"You can go anywhere for your birthday. Where to?\" A: \"Tornado.\"  Q: \"Who has the best steaks in Madison?\" A: \"Tough question. Can't go wrong with Tornado.\"  Q: \"It's late. I'm hungry. Who has the best late night bar menu?\" A: \"Tornado.\"  Q: \"I want an up North Supper Club feel without driving way outside of Madison.\" A: \"Tornado.\"  Q: \"What's a solid place for group of 6/8 near the square, and we hit drinks afterwards?\" A: \"Tornado.\"  Love Henry Doane's food so much we asked him to cook for our wedding twelve years ago. This is why five stars were invented for Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"My favorite steak house in Madison. I have to come hungry, but the bone in sirloin is amazing and always cooked appropriately to order and not overdone.  French onion soup and wedge salad are great pairings.  I love the ambiance. Great place for a drink as well"}
{"text":"This place was was fabulous!  I was on a trip for business with several other co-workers - we heard that Tornado was a good place to get a steak.  It definitely was exactly what we were looking for.  I had a fabulous steak and salad.  The ambiance was like a supper club of past times, so it was very fun to go to.  The service was A+! I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I seriously had the most tender steak of my whole life here.  And it was local, grass fed, organic - Madison style, so I didn't even feel guilty about it.   Great, sort of vintage vibe in the restaurant - with booths in a bar area that must date back to the roaring 20s or something, and tables in a wood-laden separate room that just screamed classy and Midwestern at the same time.  Great for couples on dates and small groups.  I knew I would have to shell out some serious dough for this place - but the bill was still less than L'Etoile and worth every penny.  I'll be back as soon as I can afford it again (probably another year on a grad student budget)!"}
{"text":"I was a little confused when I walked in the bar side and didn't know where to go and no one greeted us.  I loved the history of the building, but the bar stools are uncomfortably low and I am 6'4.  The bar staff must not be used to taking orders because they had to ask 4 times what we ordered.  That stuff doesn't really bother me, I just noticed it, what really matters to me is the steak!  I ordered the bone in ribeye and it was good, no complaints.  I'm not a fan of the house cut because it is so thick it's hard to cook it consistently.  I'm a fan, but didn't knock my sox off."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice.  Once for a Friday night fish fry.  Another for a late night dining experience.  Both times it was lights out.  Great service, great food, and respectable prices.  Will definitely stop back here again!"}
{"text":"I've been here for the late night menu before and greatly enjoyed it, but this past Friday night was the first time I was here for the main dining room. OMG, it was amazing.   It was graduation weekend and we didn't have reservations which meant an hour wait for the main dining room, or 5-10 minute wait for the patio. Uh, patio please. It was a beautiful night out, and the patio is decorated with lights and has a very nice ambiance. I don't know why others didn't opt for the patio, since the main dining room seemed a madhouse with all the graduates and their families.   In the 5 minutes we were waiting, we ordered cocktails. Since we were seated so quickly, the bartender found us at our table and transferred our bar tab. Now, I love single malt scotch and I love a well made single malt scotch cocktail - one that enhances the flavors of the scotch rather than mask it. And the Tornado Steak House had a cocktail that uses one of my favorite single malts (Ardbeg 10 yr). It was amazing. It had all the savory notes of the Ardbeg along with the big smokiness, the citrus notes and tartness. It was amazing and I will definitely come here just for the cocktail.   I ordered the 16 oz New York strip, and the boyfriend ordered the 28 oz bone in ribeye. All their entrees come with soup/salad and a side. I ordered the French Onion for an extra upcharge and the bf ordered the clam chowder. Both were delicious. The French Onion was rich, slightly sweet, and robust in flavor. The gruyere and french bread complemented the soup rather than smothered the soup as is often the case. The clam chowder is also delicious. It was rich with a delicate briny flavor. The bread is also really tasty. There was a mini loaf of rosemary bread that was crusty with a soft warm center. The breadstick covered with toasted sesame seeds was my favorite.   Then the entrees came, and man, so much meat. 16 ounces is a lot of meat and it was a thick slab on my plate, but heavenly melt in the mouth salty bites. I got through about a third of the steak and was so stuffed by the end. Definitely doggy bags were needed.   This place is delicious and amazing and highly highly recommended. Great place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Sorry, has been a good place in the past but their care for the customer has gone down. We had a reservation but were seated 45 minutes late without the least bit of an apology. Now, I understand 15-20 minutes off but not 45. Also, they were out of baked potatoes. OUT?!? How is this possible? \"Hey Phil, we're down to 13 potatoes.\" \"Well, put some more in the oven!\" There, problem solved. I won't be returning. Plenty of other steak joints downtown similar in cost and quality that actually appreciate your business."}
{"text":"We went to Tornado Easter Sunday to celebrate my brother-in-laws birthday -  a group of 6 with one preteen.  We were seated in a semi-private room between the bar and the front entrance which was nice for a larger group.  Nick our server greeted us and explained the menu and specials,  and gave us time to  figure out our orders.  He was friendly and informative without being overbearing.   Four of us ordered steak which was excellent - but I think we were jealous of the two who didn't....  my husband who ordered the venison and my mother-in-law who ordered the walleye.  Everyone agreed that the walleye was perhaps the best thing on the table with the venison being a close second.  In addition the market vegetable that night, a braised fennel with a cabernet balsamic reduction was unusual and delicious.  Finally even though we had birthday cake before going to dinner,  my niece convinced us to order one piece of the lemon - blueberry cheesecake and I am glad she did because it was awesome.  A light lemony cheesecake with lots of plump fresh blueberries...  a perfect ending to a great dinner.  The only thing that marred the experience slightly was a distinct cigarette smoke smell that wafted through our area about halfway through the meal.  I think they had the doors open to get some cross-ventilation and we're bringing in smoke from people smoking outside the restaurant.   All in all a way better choice than traditional Easter brunch!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Excellent Dale the Host: Arrogant and Dismissive Wait Staff: Marginally Adequate. Disconnected Food: Better than Average, NOT Exceptional Overall Experience:  DISAPPOINTING  I run a large business and understand the value in treating customers with respect. The experience begins when you walk through the door. The host should have been my indicator to turn around and walk right back out. We didn't, based on recommendations from locals.   The experience is all inclusive and not based solely on the food. The Tornado Room did not deliver. We will not return. There are too many other options in the area."}
{"text":"I have few favorites in Madison that never change.  One of them is the Tornado Room.  The steaks are tender and flavorful. I still feel this restaurant is in the top 5 for Madison.  I can't think of a time when I walked out of this place unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Good drinks, plus you can't go wrong with the steak sandwich in their late night menu  Went to Tornado on my birthday night with a couple of friends and the bartender who's name I do not remember was great!!"}
{"text":"One of the best steak restaurants in Madison.  Friendly service.  Cozy atmosphere.  They also have great cocktails and the bartenders know what they're doing."}
{"text":"On a visit to my alma mater this past weekend I was originally headed to Smoky's Club for dinner until my friend redirected us to Tornado Steak House and am I glad he did. Walking into the place, I knew I was in a real supper club/steak house.  While we waited for a table I had the pleasure of watching the bartender make the best bourbon old fashioned I have ever had.  It was painstakingly made with no shortcuts whatsoever, including a generous pour of hootch. The menu had a lot of tantalizing choices but I was mentally on the steak train and ordered the ribeye.  Again, an excellent choice. Charred on the outside, juicy and perfect on the inside.  A side of asparagus and hash browns and my night was made.  Friendly, knowledgeable server, great atmosphere and great food.  This place has it all."}
{"text":"Tornado Club is the quintessential Wisconsin supper club, and the spot we chose for our one dinner in Madison over the holiday weekend. My bf, who hails from Madison, had been here when it was originally Crandall's.  To be honest, there were other places I would have liked to have tried, but since it was a Monday after a holiday, many places were closed. Not too much of a surprise since many restaurants here are not chains and instead are family-owned and operated. The decor is exactly what you'd expect from a supper club: dark wood, lots of booths, and dim lighting. There's a bar in the front of the restaurant but is separate from the dining area. The bar had a nice crowd which seemed to have a lot of regulars.  We got comfy and looked over the wine and cocktail list. I had had my fair share of wine over the holidays so we decided to enjoy cocktails instead. They had a special list of wintry cocktails and while the \"Molly Ringwald\" caught my eye, I didn't care for the ingredients in it. Instead I chose \"Twinkling Lights\", which was sparkling cider, clove honey, and lemon juice. My bf chose a twist on a classic Old Fashioned, which came with a garnish of Door County cherries, which he very nicely relinquished to me.  My cocktail was delicious and was exactly what I was in the mood for. The spice from the clove honey added a little kick and kept the drink from being too sweet.  Since the Tornado is, first and foremost, a steak house, it behooved me to order a bone-in ribeye. I immediately had second thoughts because it could never compare to my beloved Joe's, but I thought I'd be daring. My bf ordered the walleye pike which came with a lemon-caper butter reduction.  Entreés come with a choice of French onion soup (for a slight upcharge). soup of the day, or a salad (caesar, mixed greens, iceberg wedge). I opted for the mixed greens and he went with the iceberg wedge as he was intrigued that it came with French dressing. He wanted to keep with the retro theme that this place has in spades.  The salads were just fine. We were amused at the French dressing as neither of us have seen it since we were wee kids  - back when the only two dressing choices were French or oil and vinegar.  We ordered another round and our main courses arrived. I thought my steak was a bit underseasoned and not juicy enough, but once I added some salt and pepper, it tasted better. I had serious food envy though, after I tasted the walleye. It was flaky and rich and cooked perfectly. On the side I had a baked potato (not hot enough) and he had green beans almandine (again, another retro throwback).  Despite being full, once we saw that creme caramel was on the dessert menu, we had to order it. Since they don't offer espresso or cappuccino, we had to settle for coffee.  The creme caramel had a nice silky texture, but it was just a little too sweet for me. Allow me to toot my own horn for a minute here, but I just so happen to make a flawless creme caramel and I have to say, mine is better than the one the Tornado Club serves up.  Dinner was lovely and the service was warm and efficient. We  enjoyed ourselves and will definitely keep this spot in mind for our next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse in Madison. Consistently above average food and service meshed with a classic steakhouse atmosphere make it a top spot in town.   Want a good drink and a great steak? Go. Now."}
{"text":"I went to dinner with a large party from work.  We were all travelling for training and had been told this was a must for dinner during our stay.  The drive up you see the capital building directly in front and it is very impressive.  The décor is definitely vintage, like old time 60's style, it is dark and lots of wood.  We had a small room for our large party and the staff did a great job of serving all of us together.  I had a filet that was cooked to perfection.  I also had a salad and the hash brown.  It was amazing.  I wished they had a smaller portion because I can never finish even a small filet.   It was outstanding."}
{"text":"The late night menu and 5 banquette tables in the bar of this traditional steakhouse make this place into just about the greatest location for hanging in Madison.  It's so good I wish it were a secret."}
{"text":"The roasted half chicken = GREAT! The mashed potatoes & green beans were very good, as well. The stuffing was good, but could have been better in flavor. The service was great. The bread options & Caesar salad was delish, as well. No complaints, really. The environment of the restaurant was nice - I love the level of privacy in the booths. The bar environment was very moody, dark, and retro - divine!"}
{"text":"Super cool place to grab a late night bite and drinks! After 10 PM they have a late night menu with food ranging from around $8-$15. Super good menu to taste their food for cheap!   We tried the steak and the salmon sandwich on the late night menu. Both were delicious and next time I'm definitely going to try the scallops.   I would recommend this place for anyone going on a cute date or wanting a place to get late night dinner and drinks. The ambiance is what makes it amazing on top of the food! It's first come first serve seating too."}
{"text":"The food is a bit pricey, but FINALLY I found a place that cuts steaks the way they were intended. THICK and GORGEOUS!  The decor for the place is a bit ugly, as well as terrible lighting, but casting that aside the food was delicious. My steak was a masterpiece, perfect thickness, cooked correctly, well seasoned. They bring a selection of breads to the table and offer either a soup or a salad with your meal. I wish they offered more appetizers since I am not a fan or escargot or frog legs. The waiter was kind and attentive. The prices are a bit high, but well worth it for a good steak done right."}
{"text":"What a fun evening. Thanks Bob, Theresa, Dale...and everyone at Tornado Steak House and Corral Room Bar. With so many dining choices in Madison, we were directed to the Tornado Steak House by Wisconsin Supper Clubs by Ron Faiola. Another great suggestion Ron. Owner Henry D has captured the traditional Wisconsin supper club experience with some flair at Tornado Steak House. Relish tray served \"vertical\" - check. Round \"vegas styled\" booths for intimate service in the bar - check. Perfectly mulled Brandy Old Fashioned - check. Tornado Steak House is located in the former Crandalls, and named for the infamous Spring and Summer Wisconsin storms that equally capture the attention of locals. Starting with an email and a message/ Facebook - Bob the GM was efficient, communicative and very responsive, working diligently to squeeze us in for a Saturday evening reservation - viola - a cancellation and Bob was quick to accommodate us. We arrived early and sat in the cozy circular booths - graciously welcomed with a Jack and Coke , Brandy and Southern Comfort Old Fashioned(s) - perfectly mulled and served in heavy cocktail tumblers - \"old school\" - also a couple of Karben 4, Nightcall Porter(s) - served cold and quickly with attention to detail. Appetizers of Escargot and Coquille Saint Jacques - perfectly prepared, the sea scallops are poached in white wine and served with Wisconsin cream - excellent. For dinner, three of us enjoyed the Saturday special cuts of house prepared Prime Rib and the fourth enjoyed a deliciously prepared fillet of Walleye. Dinners were served with a choice of salad - wedge w/ roquefort dressing, mixed greens and vinaigrette, or tossed spinach w/ hot bacon dressing. I had the wedge and thought it was served perfectly chilled with just the proper amount of roquefort and french - tasty. Salads were preceded by the \"vertical\" relish offering and although our bread tray was forgotten, it was quickly retrieved when we inquired. Entree's were served with the Tornado Steak House famously delicious hash browns - and Yorkshire pudding - correctly executed in their preparation and served next to the nicely seasoned prime. If you are grading supper clubs on location, ambiance, hospitality, service, charisma, food, presentation, \"x-factor\", and value - I believe you'll find Tornado Steak house will score very high on your scorecard - I know it did on ours. Thanks Tornado Steak house for creating an authentic Wisconsin Supper Club experience that we thoroughly enjoyed. Stop by and visit Tornado Steak House soon, I'll think you'll enjoy the experience as much as we did."}
{"text":"Came back here with my fiancé! The rib eye steak is still my favorite and the scallops! So yummy! I wish they would make one in Southern California!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  We have been here several times now and the food is always awesome.  The steaks melt in your mouth and the hashbrowns are the best.  I love the decor,  very cozy."}
{"text":"A nice option for high-end eating. They offer, what I would imagine to be, standard menu options for a traditional steak house.  Moderate drink and appetizer selections. The atmosphere is quite romantic and the wait staff does a wonderful job. The steak I had was great, flavor-wise, I just wish you would get a more plentiful portion for the price you're paying.  Rumor has it you can stop in late night and get a great deal on steak sandwiches. Would love to know if that's true...  Worthy of a return visit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal dining experience from the service to the outstanding steak, breads and sides that accompanied our meals. I can't wait to visit again on my next trip out that way. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious! Only downside was that we had to still wait about 20 minutes with having a reservation."}
{"text":"Came here for my husband's birthday dinner during our weekend away in Madison. There were highs: the bread, the GIANT crab legs, the cheesecake. There were things below our expectations: the drinks, my husband's steak. Everything was still pretty good, but service was a bit slow and our meal was expensive considering we have had much better drinks and steaks elsewhere. It was still a successful dinner, but we will probably try a different steak place next time."}
{"text":"Ask anyone in town who is a local where to go eat steak, and invariably this place comes up. Walk in the place, and you may have to check to see if you are in the right place. When I first walked into place back in 2005, I was miffed as one side of the place is the dive-st looking bar, and the other is the steakhouse. We turned around and walked out, but after hearing for years how good this place is, I had to go back.   Go here if the steak is important, and the aesthetics are not. If you are looking for a much nicer LOOKING place, then go to Delmonico's, not far away. Everyone I ate with at the Tornado loved their meal (2 steaks, one fish), as did I. Champagne Dan, bartender extraordinaire and food lover to the max (@ the Concourse Hotel - Shout Out to CHAMPAGNE!) recommended either the Venison, or the Flank steak, which he claimed is the owner's favorite. I got the venison, accompanied with a side of hash browns, which may sound strange, but they were damn good and crispy. Haven't eaten much deer in my day, but it was pretty good.   Bottom line - if you want steak, here is your place."}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse in Madison. Always a perfect medium rare. The baked potatoes are great too. Their cocktails are always a surprise. The late night menu is excellent; top notch in Madison."}
{"text":"Only went here once, but it was phenomenal - had the Lamb Chops with mint jelly - a classic that they did well.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"After three trips to Tornado I've decided on two stars.  Pros:  Old school atmosphere, sides included, great lighting, comfortable bar.  Cons:  Waitstaff knows nothing about wine (literally), steaks are below average quality for the price, service in general feels more like a pub than somewhere that serves $45 pieces of beef.    Honestly I'll probably pay a few more bucks for a real steak at a place like...well...I guess that's the issue in Madison...Flemings is stupid overpriced and Delmonicos is hit-or-miss.    Overall Tornado is uniquely Madison and has its pluses.  But when I'm spending that much money I expect a little better service and quality."}
{"text":"Truly a classic - when you go in to this place you feel like you are stepping back into the 40's or 50's (especially when the weather is warm and you come in through the very dark bar area with the tiny curved booths and dozen bar stools).  We always make a point to dine here when attending a Badger football game and ALWAYS are sure to make a reservation well in advance.  I have probably eaten there 5 or 6 times and always enjoy the ambiance, service and food.  This is first and formost a steak place although there's usually one in the group that always gets the walleye (easily enough for two people).  Your steak will come on a sizzling hot plate with a nice crispy onion ring on top along with your choice of potatoes and soup or salad.  They've got a nice french onion soup but you really should have the classic wedge salad that comes with both french and blue cheese dressing.  Be careful because the meal also comes with a huge bread basket with about 5 diffferent types of bread and rolls - I especially like the foot long sesame bread sticks.  Also, right after you sit down someone will place a tall water glass on the table with a couple of carrot sticks, celery, pickle and olives.  They've got a decent wine list, but are also adept at all the classic cocktails like old fashions (a Wisconsin tradition).  Definitely one of the better steak houses in the area."}
{"text":"Celebrated my 40th birthday here with no regrets.  From the relish tray (served in a icy pint glass) to the homemade breads to the soups/salad/entrees, this restaurant proudly embraces the \"supper club\" moniker.  Delicious frog legs served in a citrusy honey glaze.  I had the 28 oz bone-in ribeye and it was one of the better steaks I have eaten in a long time (close match to Prime at the Bellagio).  I have had their late night menu often and was reminded that I need to come more often.  Top notch."}
{"text":"Terrible service at a recent visit.  It was a Monday around 7ish and my co-worker and I walked in to this place.  We didn't have a reservation as we just flew in to town.  But we saw all the empty tables so we thought were good.  Asked the hostess for a table for 2.  She said the wait time will be about 30 minutes.  And we're like OK no problem.  Then we saw the empty tables outside as well.  So I asked her again if the wait time is still 30 minutes if we are to sit outside?  Surprisingly she still said yes.  So we're out there sitting and after about 30 minutes she comes out and asks \"oh did you want to just eat out here?\".  And we're like - uhmmm yeah???  Unless I was speaking Martian, I swear I remember telling her that some 30 mins earlier.  I decided to skip the steak and instead got the salmon.  My buddy got the steak.  He said the steak was disappointingly dry.  The salmon I had was too greasy.  Very lousy food.  In my opinion I can maybe cut them some slack on the lousy food if their service wasn't terrible.  Why the F would they let us sit outside for 30 mins with 10s of empty tables?  Is it because we're too casual for their \"crowd\"?  Maybe because were not wearing suits?  Or maybe they just don't give a F*** about people who just walk in without a reservation?  This used to be a must-stop for me whenever I go to Madison.  This is now on my must-avoid and do-not-recommend list."}
{"text":"Please consider replacing your front door. Last night our dinner was considerably less enjoyable than usual as the door doesn't close all the way and we were either freezing or getting up every 3-5 minutes to close it. This exact thing happened to me a few years back. At the very least treat your customers who are left to do this chore to a shift drink for their work."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant when I am craving a good steak.  I love the ambiance, reminds me of the upscale north shore Chicago supper clubs that I would go to with my grandparents. Unlike many supper clubs the wood paneling is not tacky but warm. More like Ralph Lauren lodge meets supper club.  It feels very cozy on a cold Wisconsin night.   The real draw for me is the steaks. There are a lot of places in the area that make a good steak but this is hands down my favorite. I order the same thing every time because it is beyond perfect.   Old Fashioned  French onion soup Spinach salad Filet Au Poivre in mushroom cream sauce Hash browns  I always have leftovers and unlike 90% of leftovers in my fridge I actually look forward to them."}
{"text":"I had heard rave reviews about Tornado's late night menu.  Friday night, a group of us came in for their famous late night steak sandwiches.  About half the tables in the room were full at this point.  We waited at least 10 minutes for menus/any communication from our server.  Once we received our menus, our server told us they would be back to take our order soon- this ended up being 10 more minutes..  We ordered drinks and food, and also asked for water for the table.  After ordering, we waited 45 more minutes and still hadn't received water or the drinks we ordered!  Our server ignored our table the entire time.  When we asked nicely about the wait for the drinks, the server replied with \"We only have one bartender...\" and then went on and was very defensive.  After asking, our drinks and food came out together and two of our parties orders were missing...we couldn't ask about them, because our server was nowhere to be seen again.  We still had not been given water and there were people at our table who didn't order drinks either and had been there for an hour with nothing to drink.   Also, a friend in our party had food allergies, particularly green onion.  When she asked the server about her options, the server basically told her that \"the kitchen is covered in green onion\" and there was nothing she could do to help her. and was very put off by the thought of a customer even asking for alternative options.  The steak sandwich was good, when it finally came, but the service was just terrible.  I hardly ever am disappointed with restaurants in Madison, but I was definitely disappointed after all of the hype."}
{"text":"This is the most popular restaurant and bar in Madison right now, according to a bunch of chefs and bartenders I ended up meeting, and it is so for all good reasons. It is a classic steakhouse supper club that's been unchanged for decades, but the wood is all warmly polished, the dim coloured lights are in perfect condition and the menu, though completely classic, is cooked with total love, impeccable quality and attention to detail. Some menu items are weirdsville to me - the giant chunk of iceburg lettuce slathered in blue cheese and French dressing, the deep fried cheese curds, the steak all alone on a hot plate topped with a single enormous onion ring. All sort of bizarre to this Montrealer, but that was honestly probably the best steak I've ever eaten, and the cocktails and local microbrews were just perfect too. We ate at a small table in a cozy black booth in the front bar and it was cozy and perfect.   Funny sidenote: Later in the week I was having a beer in another great bar in Madison (great in a completely different divey way) and I started chatting with the gent next to me and it turned out he had actually cooked my amazing steak at the Tornado Room! So shout out to Kalyb, give that man a raise!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here at least once a week while we lived in Madison. The steak sandwich on the late night menu is heaven and their drinks are always deliciously boozy. We moved out of state a year ago and still miss it. Absolutely one of the best the city has to offer!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was about ten years ago. I'd had many a steak at many a steakhouse in my day, but I declared their sirloin steak the best I'd ever had. I also recall that the several visits back in the day required having dinner at the bar, because reservations were booked (especially during the academic year) months in advance. This time, I ate the bar too.  I love the decor, the vibe, and the sheer retro independent personality of the place. Walking in from the street through a cramped little doorway, you kind of feel like you're in New York. Then as you enter, you might be in some Rat-pack-themed, vintage martini, Quentin Tarantino movie, At 10PM on a weeknight, and you'd think it was a Saturday night, from the number of patrons and the general festive air. Friendly barkeeps and patrons make for a unique experience.  My first time here, I had the sirloin dinner. I washed it down with classic dirty martini.That was nothing short of perfection. Recently I tried the wedge salad and the steak sandwich from the budget-friendly late night menu. The wedge is more of a retro art project than a serious salad as to flavors or nutrition. It is after all made with a chunk of iceberg. But the sandwich was the best steak sandwich ever. Nestled in a soft hamburger-sized bun, it was full of what must have been beef tenderloin dressed with what I love most with tenderloin, a horseradish cream sauce. I felt like I was making love to that sandwich, and it was loving me back. I never got around to dipping it in the au jus, because it was already so luscious and moist. Salad, sandwich and a beer ran around $21.00 sans tip.   Service by both bartenders (and by the way, thanks for having two available, Mr. or Mrs. Tornado) was fast, friendly and welcoming. The food came quickly. Tornado at night was just a great value and a fun way to spend time catching up with a fellow Yelper at the bar. After 10 years, still a favorite spot in Madison or Wisconsin, for that matter, for steaks and cocktails."}
{"text":"This was the first \"nice\" steakhouse I had ever been to in Madison. I was just a teenager, but I always thought this HAD to be the best steakhouse around. Fast forward to today. I have now been to nearly all of the upscale steakhouses in town. Tornado is still my favorite in terms of atmosphere. I love the old timey supper club vibe. It is warm, inviting and inclusive. In terms of food, it's not my absolute favorite, but definitely in my top 5. The steak is SO flavorful and always cooked perfectly. I love that they offer Yorkshire pudding, that's not something you see very often. My only gripe is the freaking HUGE portions of some of the cuts. Ribeye is my favorite cut to order, but Tornado only offers it at a whopping 28 ounces!!!! Why? I can't even eat 1/3 of that, it's absurd. They do have some more reasonably sized options, but not in the cuts that I prefer. I would definitely appreciate a smaller option that would be a little less intimidating to tackle, Plus the size (obviously) adds a hefty amount to the price tag. It just seems excessive to me. Regardless, I can't wait to go back. I love this place."}
{"text":"An amazing steak and the cuisine takes me back to the fifties suppler club era.  The service was good and I will definitely return"}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy an evening with my fiancé at Tornado after not seeing him for 3 weeks. We were seated in a large room with 7 other tables occupied. A large group of women came in and were practically yelling in the restaurant. Other tables clearly looked as frustrated as us, but none of the wait staff asked the group to quiet down a bit. We left frustrated and annoyed and would have stayed longer for more drinks and dessert had the wait staff been more attentive to \"all\" of their guests."}
{"text":"This place lives up to what I'v heard thus far about the best steak in town.  From the outside, the place looks fairly sketchy. On the inside, the atmosphere borders between a log cabin and a 1950s supper club. The waitstaff are friendly, down to earth, and knowledgeable. Tornado mixes the down to earth qualities of a supper club with touches (wine and food) of a high class steak house.  I had the 16oz NY Strip. It's served sizzling on a metal plate with an onion ring on the top. A very nicely seasoned excellent cut of meat that was perfectly cooked.  Also Jim, one of the bartenders, is the best."}
{"text":"The Tornado Room is incredible! It might be the best steakhouse in Madison, with a superb filet mignon and great sides. Also, check out their late night menu after 10pm! They have an amazing steak burger and the prices drop a lot compared to their normal dinner menu. Great service, great food, great place!"}
{"text":"I often enjoy Tornado Room after work which happens to fall under the late night menu. The menu offers a good variety of smaller dishes at reasonable prices. Great food though the service leaves much to be desired. I went in with a co-worker who requested coffee. She was not eating and was along to keep me company. The server, (Cassandra K.), proceeded to tell us she had already dumped the pot and she (my friend)didn't want it anyways because it was hours old. I responded  by asking if I could buy a POT of coffee and smiling. At this point, my friend spoke up and said she no longer wanted any coffee and Cassandra K. proceeded to walk away. Having both served and bartended previously, I was genuinely surprised by the poor service we received. I expected better from a classy joint like Tornado room. I will go back but I will try to visit earlier so that I will hopefully get a more professional server."}
{"text":"Good and service were quite average. Food wasn't served warm and the quality of cooking was low where hash browns were burnt and asparagus was mushy. I would not recommend this place if you'd like a nice steak place."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison, may be even ever!  I've been here several times for both dinner and for the late night menu and have gladly given them hundreds of my hard earned dollars. In return, I have received food memories to last a life time.   My Favorite Items: Filet au Poivre- The cognac cream sauce it is served with will blow your mind!  Coquille Saint Jacques- The scallops are always perfectly cooked. The whole dish is very well balanced. It's so good you will want to curl up in the shell it's served on and go into a food coma. You can also get this on the late night menu  Steak Sandwich- I like to get the horseradish cream on the side, because I'm a little bit of a wuss and I like to self apply saucy business.  Dinner is served with an edible centerpiece (made of veggies) and a giant plate of a variety of breads.  The service has always been very good every time I've been. A great combo of great service and great food.   I would definitely recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"honestly i think its way overpriced for what they're serving.  very dim lighting, tiny dining area.  new york strip wasn't anything impressive for its cost."}
{"text":"Low key steak house with some classic vibe.  The \"house cut\" 21oz tenderloin ($45) done medium rare was tasty and tender for the most part.  It did get a more veiny and fibrous on the areas near the bone which were more rare.  Service was pretty good with menu knowledge, refilling drinks, taking away dirty dishes, and serving the food.  My dinner companion got a \"well done\" filet ($38) that didn't come out like jerky.  There was some pink in the middle and the filet was easy to cut and chew. I saw an order of lab shank thank looked very interesting as well.   Overall, the flavors where tasty without being too salty.  The bread was fresh and warm, and the other sides were on par for any similar type of establishment. The unassuming entrance sets you up to be pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth a try in the Madison area.  (4/27/11) Revising to 3 stars from 4 after my second visit.  The service remained good but the meat was overcooked.  People in my party ordered filet and sirloin medium well that turned out to be very tough and dry.  I'm sure medium-rare would have been much better but the texture and flavor was off tonight.  The rack of lamb has a very tasty sauce and the portion was good for $28.  The yorkshire pudding was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Great meal from the French onion soup, the four different steaks our party ordered, to the pineapple upside down cake for dessert! We have been here a few times and are always impressed."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I remember when I first moved here I would walk by it all the time and pay it no mind. From the outside it always seemed a bit like a dive. How wrong I was!   For my second visit it was also during the hours where they have their late night menu. You can get an 8 oz sirloin for 13 bucks which is what I had my heart set on. It got me through the work week knowing that on Friday night I would be having an amazing steak. It's a great deal considering during normal hours their steaks will average 20 to 40 dollars.   Fried cheese curds were shared among the table. A friend thought they might actually be better than the old fashioned's cheese curds!   The French onion soup I had for an appetizer. It was good but not something I would order again.   Both times I've eaten downstairs and the ambiance is wonderful. Cozy, intimate, fun tunes, and great friendly waiting staff."}
{"text":"Tornado and I are late-night lovers. We don't ever see each other at an appropriate time, and when we do get together it's hot and heavy. Mostly in the way that I'm eating a gigantic sandwich and more steak fries than any cardiologist would recommend.   I happen to be one of those terrible people who likes all their meat well done (not burnt, mind you, but pink is for flowers, not meat). This prevents me from spending my money in a traditional steakhouse set-up because it pains the chef and my pocketbook to \"ruin\" the steak. The Tornado Room late night menu gives me a work-around. The steak sandwich is pretty thin and thus gets pretty cooked through, and their quality ground beef for the burgers doesn't beget the same side-eye when I ask for it well done.   For me, though, the star is the steak fries. They are probably my favorite fries in Madison. Part of it is their crispy exterior and creamy insides, and part of it is the tomato remoulade. Get on it, people. The horseradish cream is also quite tasty, but if I was forced to choose just one I'd pick the remoulade every time. I'm getting hungry just writing this.  Other things that I love about the Tornado is that it is stuck in time, especially the front bar and basement Corral Room. Old jukebox with mid-century records? Done. Rivet-heavy upholstery? Check. Lighting so dim no one can tell that you've dripped remoulade on your cocktail dress? They've got you covered. The prices on the late night menu also can't be beat - you're getting the same wonderful ingredients as the dining room but at a discount because you're bumping up the post-dinner rush or are coming in from a service industry job and deserve a nice meal at a reasonable price. Wonderful."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had.  Classic atmosphere. Eating here makes you feel like you could carve something out of wood or fix a car or actually impress your grandfather.  I had the house cut bone in filet and instantly grew a beard.   My dinner conversation suffered as I was reduced to grunts and moans for a lease 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Inconspicuous by day; the perfect hide-out by night!  The back entrance takes a quick spin directly into the \"Tornado Room\".  Grab yourself a bar stool, order a classic cocktail and get ready to eat some meat!  Hunker down, because that's exactly what your paying for; professional service, outstanding steaks, dark atmosphere, a 1960's bar experience and a rare Madison Tornado!"}
{"text":"One of my Top 3 restaurants in the city. Perfect for that night you're craving a steak or other hearty item. A Madison classic.  Delicious food with a better value than other \"fancy steakhouses\" in the city, which is what I'm looking for.  Friendly staff, welcoming. Lively atmosphere, which can get a little noisy at peak times. There's a reason why this place gets busy!"}
{"text":"We had been  anxiously anticipating our visit to Madison and were excited to try the Tornado having heard so much about it. The ambiance is like taking a step back in time. I almost expected Don Draper to be bellied up to the bar. Drinks in the bar were great. Well presented and delicious. Not a big gin repertoire but the old fashioned my husband and friend had did not disappoint. What did disappoint was the service.  We waited a full half hour after being seated before we saw a waiter. We had been  given water etc. but no server. We had to ask the water server for our waiter. The waiter took our order but that was about all he did.  Our friend asked for butter and that came after the meal was over. My husband asked for horseradish and that never came.  When we asked that our bill be split by couple he complied but added an automatic 18% gratuity which our friend vehemently disputed. It was then removed. I have never had such terrible service in a restaurant of this caliber. The food was delicious but with the many choices for cuisine in Madison, we will not be visiting this  establishment again."}
{"text":"Best steaks in town by far. Do not go to any of the crappy overpriced chains in Madison when you can go to the Tornado. I wish I could eat their meat every day of my life. It's also a fun place to go for cocktails.  The late night menu is so delicious that I can barely contain myself. Try the steak sandwich, the salmon sandwich and the onion rings."}
{"text":"Tornado is a must visit in Madison! We had the late night menu and got the wedge salad, steak and shared a shrimp cocktail. The shrimp cocktail was a pleasant surprise! The shrimp were huge and chilled just right and the homemade cocktail sauce was delicious. The steak was perfect as well, crispy and flavorful on the outside but cooked at a melt in your mouth medium rare on the inside.  We sat in the bar area at a cozy, intimate booth. The prices were right, you could taste exactly what you were paying for. If we lived in the area I think we would be regulars!"}
{"text":"Went here with some co-workers during a convention.  The service was a little off, but the place was crowded with convention goers, so they may have not been staffed to handle all of us.  Everyone's order came out just right even with all the attendees there."}
{"text":"This was our go to steak house / supper club when we lived in madison. Been several years so we were happy (1) it was still here and (2) it still rocks. Bonus treat was we sat downstairs for the first time.  Its like its own club and has a frank Sinatra / Sammy Davis vibe.  Like either guy could just walk in at any time.   Food was solid as always. I had a 16 oz NY strip cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Wifey had 8 oz fillet. Hers was perfect too.   I splurged and had their world famous hash browns. Omg good. Mixed with steak jus its heaven on a plate.   If you are on the square stop on in."}
{"text":"I went to the Tornado room about a year ago and postponed writing a review for a while.  By the time I was set to finally review this joint I felt that I wouldn't be able to write a worthy review until I went back; so I did. I have to say that I do not know why it has taken me such a long time to go back because this place is phenomenal!  I made reservations which I think is something that is required if you are having dinner.  We got there a few minutes early so we had a drink at the bar.  I liked the vibe, nice and dark, great music but I wish it were a bit larger.   I found myself bumping into people and constantly getting tapped so someone could walk by.  I ordered the key lime gimlet which the man said used to be called to key lime martini and I was so happy with my choice!   When our table was ready the host found us and said that the bar tab could be transferred to our table; I thought this was a nice touch.   Our waiter was very nice, read the specials and was very patient while answering the questions that we had regarding some of  the menu options.  We decided on the Rockefeller oysters which is a broiled oyster with spinach, bread crumbs, cheese and what appeared to be bacon bits to start.  The man loved it; I thought it was a bit on the salty side however.  While seated the waiter also brought bread and crudites that were gobbled up before our meal arrived.    I ordered the 8 oz filet with brussel sprouts and potato leek soup.  My steak, I will say, was the best steak I have ever had.  As I type that I know it sounds a bit dramatic but I know in my heart that it is true.  It was perfectly cooked medium rare and very tender.  The soup was great as well.  My guest ordered the venison which he just could not stop raving about!  We tried each other dishes and argued about whose was better.  I still contend that mine was the best.    We ended our dinner with the cheesecake which, just like everything else that night, was amazing.  The waiter mentioned how all the desserts were cooked in house as well.  When the bill came it was as I thought it would be so no surprises there.  I don't know if we would be going to this place as often because it is a little on the pricier side but you definitely get your money's worth.  The Tornado Room has easily become my favorite steakhouse in the area."}
{"text":"Tornado is an unbelievable dining experience. After we were seated, an array of fresh, crispy vegetables was delivered. Our cocktails were made to order. After we ordered, a variety of breads arrived at the table. The escargot was satisfying. Next, Rob enjoyed a crock of french onion soup. I ate a salad of greens dressed with a delicious vineagrette. Rob's entree was duck breast medalions with a port wine currant reduction. I opted for the prime rib with yorkshire pudding. Both of us chose hash browns as our side. We also ordered coffee reminiscent of our trip to Europe.  The service was EXCELLENT as was our welcome by the front of the house. It was a great anniversary celebration."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying i LOVE the decor in the bar area, and the restaurant reminds me of a classy version of our cabin in the nortwoods. Just one look and we knew that our food would be fantastic.  We had made reservations and were seated immediately. We sat down, ordered drinks and perused the menu. I ordered a spiced pear martini, which sounded good for some odd reason but I didn't love, and the waitress gladly took it back (and didn't charge me for it!). We didn't order an appetizer, opting to pick at the bread instead. The bread was fantastic - some kind of freshly baked rosemary loaf - but we tried not to fill up on it in order to save room for our steaks.  I started with the baked french onion soup, which was really, really good, and had the 8oz. filet with asparagus for my entree. This steak was aMAZing. (This is coming from a girl whose uncle raised beef cattle.) It was tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned with just a little salt and pepper.  My boyfriend ordered the peppercorn encrusted sirloin and he was grinning the entire time he was eating it.   We were totally stuffed but decided to order dessert anyway, since this was a birthday dinner. The ho-ho was sooooo good and somehow we found room for it.   I am not a huge steak eater most of the time, but dang... So good! You have to go here if you even sorta kinda like red meat."}
{"text":"The wife and I celebrated my birthday tonight at the Tornado Room.  Overall, very good, but a bit inconsistent and questionable when it came to value.    Atmosphere-- Loud and dark.  I  liked it, but I could see this being a turn-off for others.  Drinks- Excellent martinis and gimlets.  Bread-- Fantastic.  Appetizers-- very disappointing.  We split frog legs and escargot.  Both left a lot to be desired.  The frog legs were extremely bland-- both the batter and the meat itself seemed like they could have used more seasoning.  Not good.  Escargot was ok but certainly nothing to write home about.  I really liked the escargot at Nadia's when it was still open. These were really unremarkable.  I managed to push one of them into the shell and didn't even expend the effort to get it back out.  Wouldn't eat this again.  Salad and Soup-- My wife had the spring mix with balsamic vinaigrette.  She said it was very good.  I loved the French onion soup.  Steaks-- Excellent.  Wife had the 8 oz filet, which she really liked.  I had the tenderloin, which was also very good.  I liked the idea of the onion ring on top, but didn't love the onion ring itself-- as someone else said, it was almost doughnut like-- encrusted in a thick batter rather than a nice crispy coating.  I didn't love it, though the wife enjoyed it quite a bit..  I went for the hash browns, just because I saw them mentioned in so many reviews.  They were nothing special.  I would order a baked potato if I had to do it over again.  In any case, the meat had wonderful flavors, but was quite pricey.    Service- very good.  No complaints.  Unobtrusive and competent.    Overall, we both really enjoyed the meal, but for $160 (before tip) I think I could find better in Madison.  If we did it again, we'd skip the appetizers and probably be much more satisfied.    Finally, one complaint-- do you really need to charge $1.50 extra for french onion soup (instead of the soup du jour)?  Given the price of this place, this felt like I was being nickel and dimed."}
{"text":"If international conflict were determined by 1950's cocktails, I'm pretty sure Tornado's Old Fashioned could create world peace.   Muddled cherries, perfect bittered tartness, and brandy, because we're in Wisconsin, dammit!  Check out the late night menu, because you aren't going to be stuffing your face from 10pm-1am with this much class anywhere else."}
{"text":"I love that this place has late night eats. It's pretty much like a reverse happy hour, but for food. From 10pm to 1am in their bar and lounge area, you can get specially priced goodies like a steak sandwich for $8. Their bar area is really nice for a late night date. The lighting is dim and sexy. You will find yourself making out with someone like this one couple we saw. The sexy food and sexy lighting will guarantee that you can't keep your hands off each other."}
{"text":"All Wisconsin steak houses R not created equal. Went w hi expectations and was disappointed.. Jamie our server was great. The bread, salad, veg were all first rate.  The hash browns were greasy and the t-bone had good flavor but was chewy. Walleye was good but overall not up to standards. Smokey in Madison and Schwartz's in New Holstein R far superior choices. I can't imagine trying it again"}
{"text":"We come for Friday Fish. This is the best $14 dish in town. Together with soup, bread, and two sides, it's really good deal."}
{"text":"Fun little place to visit as when you walk in you take a quick time warp back to the1970's. When you finally get to your table after enjoying your drinks at the bar,  you take a time machine back to the future to enjoy cutting edge fine dining."}
{"text":"My review is based on the late night menu/experience, and it was a good time! We didn't really want pizza, and instead opted to visit Tornado. The steak sandwich with au jus is pretty dang spectacular! Giving it 4 instead of 5 stars as service was a bit slow on a night that wasn't particularly busy."}
{"text":"ALWAYS perfect drinks, and if you're lucky, you'll catch them while they're experimenting at the bar.  I've been coming here for years, but honestly, everything I've eaten has been eclipsed by the amazing duck.  All other food is designed to keep me preoccupied while I wait for the duck."}
{"text":"Gods greatest gift to the world has got to be the late night steak sandwich from Tornado Room. I'm not sure if it's the horseradish, the jus, the tender steak, or the pillowy roll that does it, but it could be the greatest sandwich in the Madison area. It could also be that it just tastes delicious after a few drinks with friends.   I've been known to order a second, to go, so I can enjoy it again as leftovers for breakfast. Seriously, that sandwich is delicious cold too.   Service can be a little slow, but the ambiance makes this a great location for date night or just some drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I love everything about the Tornado Room. Everything about this place is a throwback to a bygone era, from the wood-paneled walls, low ceilings, and and dim lighting, to the simple menu, complementary garnishes, and delicious cocktails. Even their late-night steak sandwiches are fantastic.   If you're looking to get your socks knocked off with a gastronomic experience, go elsewhere. The Tornado is about standard steaks, chops, and fish prepared the old fashioned way, with standard sides like baked potatoes, hashbrowns, and thick-cut vegetables. It's rare at a steakhouse for the sides to be included in the protein prices, but they are at Tornado, which I believe makes this place an extra good value.   Order an old fashioned or some recommended wine to wash your meal down, and enjoy every second of the classic fine dining experience. This is not the kind of place you'll have the pleasure of walking into every day."}
{"text":"This is where I learned that fried cheese curds taste surprisingly just like mozzarella sticks. Maybe that's not so surprising after all.  If you too want to learn this, head to the bar for the late night menu. Here you'll be treated to good eats at affordable prices. Take, for example, the steak sandwich. A steal of a deal, and not half bad. The burger also looked atrociously large and delicious.  It's small and cramped, but why worry about that when there's well-priced grub to be had?"}
{"text":"Situation: I'm in Madison for only a couple days. I'm trying to relax a little and the nba playoff game I was watching in my hotel room on a shitty 19\" tv bored me to death. Result: Unintended nap that screwed up most possible dinner plans.   Ok. Yelp tells me the Tornado Club is lookin fine. I now recall a car I once owned. A 1985 Olds Toronado. I liked that car. This car was Caliente. Literally. Tornado Club, the correct term would not be Caliente; it is somewhere between Cheers and insert name of hip west coast lounge.   Glad that is over with. So I see that the Tornado Club has a late night menu. I missed dinner once 10 came around. That's ok . I step in to the bar around 10 and see the room occupied by about 15 people, a nice intimate setting, dark, warm, etc. The manhattan I ordered was a little weak. The salmon sandwich is looking nice. The classic jazz vocalist is sweet to the ears. Sandwich arrives: nice! this is about a 5 story building to a carl's jr $6 burger's 3 stories (the salmon sandwich is tall ok). They're giving late night bar food a classy, gourmet, and affordable touch...I'm down.   Moving on to the wine list... The pinot noir and the spanish cab by the glass turn out to be great after dinner potables. Now we are listening to OutKast's Stankonia. I'm still down. This is maybe my favorite record from the group. I could do without the Bob Marley, and the talk of leaving Scissor Sisters out of the equation was a sure relief.   All in all, this was a pleasant experience. Damn, i'm out of lsd."}
{"text":"Tornado Room is one of the more unique dining experiences in Madison. You walk in and feel like you may be in the 80s and also in your grandma's basement. It reminds me of a supper club. In fact, I believe it is considered one. The bar area is extremely cool and old fashioned, with u-shaped booths and tiny tables. I highly recommend snagging one of these spots around 10pm on a Saturday night and order a brandy old fashioned press with an order of their Coquille Saint Jacques. This dish, scallops poached in white wine and presented over mashed potatoes with heavy cream, is my favorite thing to eat in Madison. Plus, it's served in a half seashell. If you're looking to try something not-so-modern I recommend the Tornado Room."}
{"text":"Possibly the best steak I ever had was at the Tornado. If you are asking yourself, where should I get a steak in Madison? The answer is Tornado Room. Don't bother shopping around, just go and enjoy a delicious and perfect steak.  The exterior of their establishment is bland, edging on run down in appearance (especially from the side that doesn't feature their outside patio) but belies the cozy interior, a classic supper-club vibe, and wonderful food. The prices are medium-high but not inappropriate for good quality steaks. Although occasionally the cocktails seem a bit pricey.  My favorite- either the NY Strip (for that delicious rich meat flavor) or the Filet. Bear in mind when ordering the filet that it is a truly large, thick cut, so order it a temperature or two higher than you would want in a thinner steak like the NY strip.  In other words, I like my meat med-rare, so for the Filet I order it medium to medium well. Otherwise the inside is past rare and I hate being that girl who sends her steak back to be re-fired.   Their steaks are served with a thick-cut giant onion ring on top, which is easy to miss in the menu so if you hate onions for whatever reason, be warned and be aware. And then give your onion to me, because I want it. Thanks. Also, I really like their french onion soup, which I think they always have in addition to the soup of the day.   I was mildly disappointment by a fish special, and their vegetable sides are occasionally bland or dry, especially in the winter. But what can you do, it's winter. But really, Tornado is known for the red meats, and I should have known better than to stray from their forte.   I'm not one of those folks who demands bread for their table before a meal I already know will be rich and filling. But I honestly look forward to their bread-basket, with the warm, fresh-baked herbed mini-loaf as the star. I can't help myself, I always eat half of it.   Also note that they have a great late-night menu with a more limited selection and a lower price tag. I must admit I have never partaken of this menu, but have perused it while having a late-night drink after work. Looks like a delicious bargain to me.   Occasionally they are quite busy, especially on the weekend.  So I would recommend coming early or making a reservation. Their service has always been acceptable or good. I definitely would recommend it. Dinner for two with one cocktail and no desert ran around $100 plus tip, and we chose mid ranged items.  Overall very tasty, well prepared steaks.  I can however complain that during the summer, their establishment is uncomfortably hot inside. But the same could be said for many restaurants in Madison's downtown old buildings."}
{"text":"Tornado Room is one of my top spots in Madison.  Enjoy Perfectly Crafted Cocktails?  The BEST Lamb Chops in all of Madison?  Maybe something a little Different like Frog Legs?  This Place has great food.  Not to Mention Awesome Steaks.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Whether you are a Madison local or stopping by from Chicago or parts unknown for a weekend visit, you must make Tornado Club one of your stops.  It is a supper club frozen in time; upon entry in the bar you would not be surprised to see Don and Betty Draper, Don swigging an old fashioned, oblivious to Betty's obliviousness.  You'll be tempted to have an old fashioned or three yourself, and dive into their world of oblivion, but not before getting yourself some serious meat.  First, the decor.  As I alluded to above, the bar is straight out of the forties, with gorgeous curves, and, as a I recall, a smooth marble top.  The bar \"stools\" are not stools at all but gorgeously upholstered captain's chairs.  We arrived just in time for our table, but were sure to spend a couple hours after dinner at the bar.  The bartenders are very friendly, and well versed in, dare I say it?, mixology, creating some old school aperitifs after the desire for Manhattans wears thin.  The various dining rooms - of which there are, I believe, three - have a similar vintage vibe, one with wood paneling on the walls and another, the one we dined in, with an arched, plaster coated ceiling, old time wall sconces, and a fireplace.  For my money, THIS is the room to dine in.  It feels like you are in a country lodge eating freshly killed cuts of meat.  And those cuts of meat here are great - I had the venison tenderloin, seared in a red wine sauce.  It had the smoky, gamy notes you expect from a quality cut of venison, and the red wine sauce gives it a hit of primal bloody flavor that knocks the dish out of the park.  It was so rich it was a struggle to finish but I barreled through.  Kelly had one of the steaks, and it was prepared a gorgeous medium rare, slightly crispy on the outside and oh-so-juicy on the inside.  After dinner, I sampled the extensive bourbon and rye selection at the bar, and capped off the night with a well-crafted Italian digestif.  If I lived in Madison, I'd be here a couple of nights a month, if not more, without a doubt.  This is a dining establishment to be proud of!  PS - As a fun aside, check out the Tornado Club website some time when you can have your speakers on - www.tornadosteakhouse.com - it has an awesome loop of space age bachelor pad music.  Makes me want to fix myself a cocktail right now - gotta go!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madtown.  Good for either a romantic dinner or for some late night food in the bar area.  The steaks are great and are served with a huge doughnut-like onion ring.  I love the hash browns and the shrimp cocktail as well.  Drinks are excellent and the wine list is nice; also a limited but good seafood menu.  My favorite part however is the untouched 50s supper-club decor.  If you are in Madison, trust me, this place should be one of the top slots on the list.  Disregard any negative review, however the service can be a little on the snotty side, which you should just have fun with because it's coming from 23 to 26 year old poli-sci grad students from Minneapolis."}
{"text":"So before my trip to Wisconsin I of course Yelped the area to get an idea of where I would eat.  Gotta love Yelp.  Anyhoo, after arriving in Madison I saw that this city is very diverse in it's food and culture.  If I didn't know any better I would've thought I was in Washington State.  So of course that takes all the Chinese, Japanese, Thai restaurants off the list, as well as the burger joints etc.   So I thought, if I as in Thailand I'd try genuine Thai food,  Louisiana...no question, authentic cajun food....but what's uniquely Madison, Wisconsin other than cheese, though I like very much, I'm a little lactose intolerant so any more than a couple of cubes my carbon (more like methane) footprint would go through the roof....okay...sorry, back on target here...  So other than cheese,STEAK!  Oh yes.......that beautiful word...STEAK.  And I gotta tell ya, this place knows steaks.   Now I did have a few to drink at Genna's nearby, so I was a bit happy by the time they opened.  When I got there the bartender there kept me entertained with nice converstation and more happy water until my table was ready.  The place is kinda dark which wasn't helped by my blurred vision, but I was able to get out my order to a very kind wait staff.   So big  plus to this place for customer service.  Okay, the food.  OMG!  I started out with...get this....escargot...IN WISCONSIN?  Okay, I personally like cooked snails in a nice buttery garlic sauce, but I was really surprised to see it there so I figured what the hell, give'r a go yeah?  Any you know what....They cook a mean escargot!.......now there's a sentence you never thought you'd hear.  Then they bring this bread...which is really good, warm...and good, did I say good?  Normally I don't eat the bread at a restaurant because it takes up room in my tummy, but because I was \"happy\" I wasn't in my right mind....so my eyes were bigger than my tummy you could say.   Because when my steak got there...........  MY GOD, it was huge.  Right next to it was a big ol thing of hashbrowns and a deep friend onion ring.  I was full just looking at it all......DAMN BREAD....and snails!  So the steak: Big ol potion, I think it was like 28 oz something, I don't know, but big.  Really good quality meat, cooked to perfection, bone in, juicey, seasoned just right.  Honestly, it rivaled any steak I've had at the Metropolitan Grill and Daniel's Broiler....but at a fraction of the price.  Seriously.  The entree (steak, hash, onion ring) was only like 30 dead presidents, but it was just as quality as the $60.00 ones in Seattle.    Anyhoo I took a picture of it....you can check out my photos....needless to say I couldn't finish it.  I was very ashamed of myself, a damn embarrassment!  I did however manage to get it back to Seattle with me because I was leaving the next day.   The hotel was kind enough to stick it in their fridge for me until my flight.  Because it was in one of those aluminum storage containers, airport security really scutinized my carry on, but eventually let me go, and though I had it in a insulated bag with ice packs and stuff, when they opened up the overheads in Seattle, the wonderful smell of a perfect steak made it's way through the cabin.  Oh, people pretended not to notice, but I knew it made them all hungry.   Lucky for me it was all mine!  Which I finished off the very next day...and you know what?  It was just as good as the day before.....  Okay......WAAAAAAY off target here....  Conclusion:  if you ever find yourself at the UW-Madison, WI don't forget to put the Tornado Club Steak House on your \"Must Eat There\" list."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating a full dinner here. It was the man friends birthday and he decided he wanted a steak the size of his head. And I wanted an old fashioned done well. So. Tornado room seemed like the only choice.  We split an order of oysters, and then for dinner I had the ceaser salad with the French onion soup and about 6 bites of his delicious steak (that faux-vegetarian thing in me sometimes dictates that I do need a few bites of horrible-for-your-heart but great-for-your-soul melt-in-your-mouth red meat). Between what the sig-other ate and the few bites I had, that steak was done for. Dominated that thing.   Tornado; you get it right. Every time."}
{"text":"A truly great steakhouse.  Though it took a bit of time, they were able to make the best Vesper I've ever had.  The old fashion was also extrodinary.  When I asked for a very rare steak the server asked if I wanted it black and blue which is the only way to eat tenderloin but few places will prepare it that way."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get cocktails or late night food in Madison. Their specialty cocktails are delicious and strong. I love the James Madison or the Key Lime Gimlet if I want dessert. From the late night menu, the steak sandwich is one of the best menu items in Madison. The steak is cooked perfectly and goes so well with the horseradish sauce.  What really sets this place apart from the rest is the ambiance. It's 1920s speakeasy meets Wisconsin supper club. Dim lighting and cozy seating make it a great place to go in a very small group."}
{"text":"Classic Kitchy Supper Club Wisconsin.  That about says it all and I didn't even need to mention the food, but I will. I was presented with the most glorious 20 oz hunk of Ribeye I had ever seen. It was still sizzling on a hot aluminum plate that added much to the presentation and greatly to my enjoyment! Most have already mentioned the retro menu: Oysters Rockefeller, Shrimp Cocktail, Creamed Spinach... Wow. We ate there a week ago and my head is still spinning. Great service, great cocktails (Brandy Old Fashioned - sweet, of course) and an overall great experience. Everyone one in the room had full bellies and big smiles. I may have giggled for an hour after wards."}
{"text":"let's just say the servers are not friendly ....  this was my 2nd visit to this steakhouse. the 1st visit was a total disaster. the server spilled drinks all over the table and one of our guests. the steak i ordered rare came to me medium at best. everyone at the table knew it even before i was told to cut into it by the waitress. apparently she did not realize that when a person tells her that anything more than rare will be sent back, they mean it because they are experienced and have had many bad experiences due to some cooks not knowing how to cook a truly rare steak. that being said, all i had to do was look at the steak to see it was obviously overcooked. the waitress had the audacity to tell me she would take it to the kitchen to make sure i was right.   sorry to be indignant about it, but when a customer tells you the $40 steak is not cooked right maybe, just maybe, the customer knows what he or she is talking about. needless to say the waitress came back and said that i was indeed right and that they would cook me a new steak. it was just the snotty way she said it that sticks with me.  so, we decided to give it another try. anyone can have a bad night and it was quite packed that night.  well, the 2nd time the service was just as unfriendly. in fact, the waitress was down right rude. when i told her of my experience the first time and reiterated that anything more than rare would be sent back, she merely said the cooks really knew what they were doing and that couldn't have happened in this restaurant. as if i would lie about my first dining experience there. really?!?!  mind you it is an hour drive from Milwaukee to Madison then another hour back home. so let's get to the details.  the food is in general good. i ordered the large filet the 1st time. after the 2nd try it was cooked just the way i like it. nothing special. just a decent rare steak. so there was nothing wrong with the dinner. i tried the ceasar salad. again, your average salad minus the crutons, ofc.  the 2nd visit i ordered the venison filet. the sauce on the was overbearing. if you try it, get the sauce on the side so you can decide if you like it or how much you want to put on it so that you can taste the venison. it did come out rare the 1st time. so kudos for the waitress at least listening or the cook for actually reading the order correctly. the filet was served with cooked kayo and baked potato (undercooked). i guess you have to really like kayo to enjoy it. i found in pungent and let the vegetarian at the table enjoy it. the 2nd visit i ordered the salad. it came out as a wedge. it was swimming in french salad dressing. by the time i cut it all up, the lettuce had wilted into a coagulated mess. i just couldn't finish it .. it was awful. again, get the dressing on the side so you can put on how much you want so this does not happen to you.  in summation, perhaps this trendy restaurant wants to make its guests feel ill at ease. snooty servers can ruin a good night out. rude ones can make it a trial. the staff needs to learn that they can make up for a bad night by at least being friendly. they don't have to hover or be your best friend. both visits every person in my party commented about the poor service and bad attitude. that's 4 the 1st time and 6 on the 2nd visit. overall, we have all agreed that we will not be back.  the 2 star rating is due to the service, not the food. if i rated the food, perhaps a 3 or 3.5 star rating would be appropriate. i have had better steak. my favorite steakhouse in Milwaukee is the 5 O'clock Steakhouse on State Street in Milwaukee (formerly Coerper's). they know how to treat people and cook a fine steak for about the same price. Tornado could learn a lot from them."}
{"text":"I love the Tornado Room!! I have been to both the restaurant and the lounge late night.   The restaurant is amazing. On the outside, it looked like a dark diner. On the inside, it looked like an old steak house with the wood paneling and dim lighting on tables. I had the wedge salad and rack of lamb. Both were very good.   I've gone to the lounge several times and never been disappointed. If you go after 10pm there is a late night menu with delicious food and really lovely- read low- prices. While I've eaten several things off the late night menu the one that sticks out in my mind is the french onion soup. I would recommend it- it's perfect for a cold Wisconsin winter night. The cocktails are great as well as the ambiance- I know I loved being able to slide into a curved booth for a more quiet night of drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food was nice and very good service. I would come back again. The biggest problem was parking."}
{"text":"Had some steak, oysters and duck here. All phenomenal! Prices are pretty standard for a quality steak house. The meat here is premium grade."}
{"text":"I came here with the BF after a long afternoon of steady drinking and carbo loading. I was feeling pretty lousy and told him that I needed water and meat for dinner. He yelped and found Tornado and told me to order whatever I wanted on the menu. I got a Caesar Salad, NY Strip , and a side of asparagus. He got the New England Clam Chowder, rack of lamb, and a side of fries. The food was all amazing. Everything was cooked to perfection and came out exactly how we ordered them. We sat at the bar since the wait was about 45 minutes. We got excellent service and had a great time. I would definitely come back here if I ever find myself in Madison again. Mmmmmm steak!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Tornado!  The exterior of the restaurant does not do justice to the classy interior, and also makes the restaurant relatively difficult to find. I got a classic filet mignon, which was delicious! They bring you an interesting \"edible centerpiece\", made of pickles/celery/carrots and an assortment of other vegetables. It was certainly something I'd never seen before at another restaurant!  Overall, the food and service were just short of superb. I would highly recommend making a reservation, as this place is quite small and gets very crowded."}
{"text":"others here have pretty much covered  it, but I'll add my 2 cents.  The Tornado club is 1 of 3 best steak places in Madison.  Located downtown, and reservations are a must (Sundays at 5 is a great time).  daily specials start at 15 up to +45.  If you are looking to save some cash, share the steak and potato with a friend and order an extra side salad.  The Tornado has that old school supper club feel (minus the old dirtyness that comes with them) and super beers, wines and drinks to keep you happy."}
{"text":"We came in with no reservation and I was on the fence about coming here. I will say that it wasn't a very warm welcome when I called on my way and got there asking about a table. I didn't know the drill about grabbing a bar table. But, once we got settled, this was a trip back in time that was well worth it. Traditional steakhouse finds. A pretty limited menu. But, the steaks are the showstopper centerpiece here. One of the best I have had! We both loved our steaks and after one of the hip new restaurants in town the night before this was a fun contrast. It is pretty pricey for how straightforward the menu is and how old-school the decor is, so not sure I would head back in a hurry with all the new dining Madison has to offer. But a gem that hopefully will stick around for a long time."}
{"text":"Had a terrible birthday here. The late night menu has gone down hill, the waiter had no clue what he was doing, I.e trying to take our plates away before we are finished, bringing more food when we were not finished, asking how the food is seconds after dropping it off.  For the price and the dedication it takes to grab a table right at 10, is a shame. The burger was a disgusting mess which you couldn't even eat with your two hands. How is that a burger ? Cooks and the waiters need to be retrained, I can tell these guys do not care at all about the quality of this 'steakhouse' .  Won't be back, thanks tornado we'll go to Rare where they get it done right."}
{"text":"Had a great time there. Their Old Fashion was delicious. Had the Steak (Fillet Au Poivre),  soup, brussel sprouts, and beer. Nice and rustic place with lots of character. Would recommend this place if ever in the area. If you can make reservations I would recommend it otherwise you might be waiting a little bit. Especially when college is in session."}
{"text":"In town for business and his restaurant was suggested by some locals. Tornado has an old school steakhouse feel and the food was really good. The prices were definitely getter than most other steakhouses I have been to.   If you are in Madison or definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Dark wood, dim lighting, and Old Fashioneds all around! We stopped in late on a Saturday to get our steak fix on and had a great meal here at Tornado Steak House. My husband and I split the GIANT 28 oz. on the bone Ribeye and let me tell you, this thing is huge. Loved the traditional iceberg wedge that came with the meal as well as the hash browns and giant onion ring on top of the steak, but the steak itself was honestly a little lacking. It just wasn't all that flavorful or tender which was a bit of a bummer. But...our friends that live in Madison swear by this ribeye...maybe it was just the fact that we came in later in the evening and they just wanted to get people out of there...who knows. The atmosphere was really cool and we still walked out completely stuffed so I can't be too upset. When we return to Madison I would definitely give Tornado another go."}
{"text":"Word was this was the place to visit for steaks when in Madison. Great old-world supper-club feel to it. The beautiful wood paneling gave it a homey feel but did little to dampen the sound of a houseful of customers, so it can get a bit loud. Our server knew the menu well and offered great tips and information to get us placed with nice dishes. My wife had the 16 oz. NY Strip and I had the Walleye. The food was well-done, with salads chill and fresh, and the entrees a testament to why this establishment is still around over 20 years! A classy experience!"}
{"text":"Plan ahead on your visit here. It can be very exclusive seating. The food is totally worth the price! I'm never disappointed when I visit here. Also, be prepared to be fullll when you leave. They serve veggies and bread before your real meal comes. I was stuffed beyond measure and my pants knew it. Unfortunately, I don't think sweatpants would've been appropriate attire...but I needed them when I left! ;)"}
{"text":"Order the 28 oz. ribeye on the bone, it was a really good decision. Had them cook the steak medium, it was cooked perfectly. Flavor was memorable. Asparagus were nicely cooked. Onion ring, it was giant see the pic, was a nice touch.   The place had a cool vibe to it & the service was friendly. All around good times eating great food."}
{"text":"Following is my personal, highly scientific \"supper club\" grading system - did the Tornado pass or fail??? Read on:  Requirement 1 - vintage bar with lots of Naugahyde, tacky lighting and bartenders with the ability to make a good old-fashioned.  PASS - all present and accounted for. Bonus points for the old-timey neon out front.  Requirement 2 - relishes PASS - Tornado serves proper relishes (carrots, celery, olives, onions, radishes, etc) threaded on skewers in an iced glass. Like a bloody Mary, but without the tomato juice. Also present - a loaf of homemade bread, soft breadsticks and a biscuit. Yum.  Requirement 3 - \"classic\" appetizers straight out of 1965 PASS - Oysters Rockerfeller? Check. Shrimp cocktail? Check. Escargots + frog legs too! My shrimp cocktail was a thing of beauty - huge, meaty, clean shrimp with spicy cocktail sauce.  Requirement 4 - French onion soup that is mostly cheese and bread PASS - as a bonus the Tornado's version was not too salty. Delicious.  Requirement 5 - enormous steaks, properly cooked PASS -  my filet au polvre was the best steak I have EVER had. EVER. Buttery, tender and perfectly cooked - absolutely delicious. The Mister had a monster strip which had amazing flavor - maybe a seasoning of wine + shallots?  Requirement 6 - \"Experienced service\" PASS - our waitress was clearly a veteran of the industry. She was fun and made sure we never lacked for anything.  I really have no complaints about the Tornado - amazing food served in a classic atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The main reason I go to Tornado is for their frog legs. Incredible. The entrees and the rest is fine, I'm sure, but I really have trouble seeing beyond the perfection of those magic frog legs."}
{"text":"The duck & NY Strip were beyond impeccable. As well as the service. Truly enjoyed this experience. Nice warm cabin-esque feel to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was great! We went here to celebrate our anniversary a few months ago. If you're looking for the classic steakhouse/supper club vibe, this is it. It's dark and kinda quiet, but you don't feel out of place having a good laugh. The service was non-pretentious and just fast enough to make you feel like they pay attention, but aren't worried about flipping your table for the next group. It's kind of expensive, but not out of line for the type of restaurant and menu. The food was exactly what we expected. I loved the \"relish glass\" with the carrots, radishes, celery and other standards instead of the relish tray. I've never tried the late-night menu but I've heard from people that I trust that it may be the best deal in all of downtown."}
{"text":"Came by for the late night menu. It was fairly busy when I arrived at nearly midnight, and it seemed there was only 1 waitress serving the bar area. Bar was more casual than expected, and I enjoyed the relaxed environment. Quality steakhouses can often feel so stuffy. Can't speak to how the main dining room is though.  Ordered the scallops which were divine. The sauce is such a great complement to both the scallops and the potatoes, and definitely wasn't overpowering or too heavy. The scallops didn't have any real caramelization on them, but they were tender and juicy.  The sirloin really is as good as everyone on Yelp raves. The seasoning and crust on it was mouthwatering and succulent, and mine came out a perfect medium rare, rested and ready to be devoured. As with any sirloin there are some weird bits in the meat, but overall it was quite decadent and definitely top quality.  Minus one star for reallllllly slow service. Initially I thought it was because the place was pretty full so I gave the waitress a pass, but even as it cleared out and I was one of 2-3 parties remaining in the bar area, I had to wait around 10 minutes between each time I saw her.  Bottom line: the late night menu is delicious and is an excellent value."}
{"text":"I can sum up the entire Tornado experience with \"good not great\". First, you must get there early and have a martini in the old fashioned bar.  Wonderful dark supper club esq decor, complete with vintage bar stools. The dinner was ok, escargot was amazing! Very flavorful sauce.  Caesar salad  very disappointing, not enough dressing, and everyone likes a good Caesar at a steak place.  No option for mashed potatoes- really? Only baked or fries or an option the waitress couldn't really explain.  Steaks were good- not great.  Tornado can't cook Brussels to save their life, very underdone, do not order!  An expensive place should be quick with the drinks, tornado was not.  Which is a rookie move, more drinks equals more tip!"}
{"text":"Based solely on steak, I'd give it a five.  The strip was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  But there were misses.  The Caesar salad was dry and lacking dressing.  The onion ring, was burnt to a crisp and absolutely disgusting.  The drinks were on point but the busboy took my 2nd drink and it wasn't even empty.  Another person had their beer taken and it wasn't empty either. Took over an hour to get food.  Granted this isn't outback, but it seemed excessive.  If you want great steak, definitely try it!!"}
{"text":"Just like Aaron, we too only had some cocktails here... but went to check out lounge aspect we had heard so much about.  It really awesome in here, and if I ate steak I would come back just to spend more time in this old school Wisconsin supper club atmosphere with a twist of 50's mod.  I would still go back for a drink next time I go through Madison, the people watching and low wood paneling ceiling were thrilling enough!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Madison. Great steaks. Good drinks and decent service. Pretty typical birthday dinner joint for this yelper."}
{"text":"Overall it's excellent and I would recommend to anyone.  Have been there multiple times and will go again.  The ONE thing I don't like is that the NY Strip steaks are not the best around.  I've had a lot of NY Strip steaks in my life and these are not the top of class.  But - I mean the meat itself.  prep, service, etc, all very good."}
{"text":"I've only had the pleasure I sampling the late night menu, but the food we had was great. The atmosphere is reminiscent of old-school Milwaukee supper clubs, and everybody there was in a good mood. Things get busy, though."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Atmosphere is great but couldn't hear any music Saturday night though? We sat at the bar in one of the booths and had a great couples meal. Shrimp cocktail and escargot followed by sharing a filet with Brussels sprouts. Everything was cooked perfectly and the service was excellent. My only complaint was no music. I wanted to hear Frank Sinatra or the rat pack or something."}
{"text":"Loveeeee!!  Start with scallops! Anything you order will be delicious! I can't wait to come back to Madison to eat here again! This is by far my favorite steak house I've been to. Love the bar and ambiance!"}
{"text":"December? December! That's the last time I took it to the keys to pound out some prose for these guys?  Don't ask me why it's taken so long to update my lower level review about the basement which I sort of abstain from now. Don't ask me why it's taken so long to give high praise for the upstairs. And don't ask me how many weekends are spent in low lighting eating one of my favorite steaks on the capital. Their late night (after 10pm) menu is beyond compare. It only has a handful of options but each is incredible. The steak has been and will forever be my jam. At $13 it's a steal, and throw an onion ring the size of my head on top and it's even better! They also have a pretty extensive cocktail situation and I know they'll make you anything you want off the menu. It seems like they might be switching out some wines, because there were some new pages this week when I eyed them over. Staff behind the bar during the week and on weekends is top notch; attentive, conversational, prompt! It's a little tricky to sit in the small booths with more than one other person, but honestly part of the fun is figuring out how you're going to cram two steaks, a basket of fries, cheese curds and two cocktails on a surface the size of a Nilla wafer."}
{"text":"My husband & I have eaten here for special evenings. Best steaks in Madison and fabulous service."}
{"text":"Dark inside with the smell of an old building.....Server was knowledgeable, but not friendly and almost inattentive. Food was good.."}
{"text":"Wow am I embarrassed. I've come here for years when in from out of town. One of my favorite Madison restaurants. I'm hoping the food is still good but 90 minutes after ordering our entrees, they're still not here. The people I brought here on my recommendation are trying to be polite but it's obvious they're thinking I talked this place up unnecessarily. Drinks not refilled without maximum effort to alert the server. Really really bad service."}
{"text":"Had my husband's birthday dinner here, we had a great time. The food was great, so did the service. The only thing I didn't like is the table that we got, it was wayyy too small n too close to the people next to us. It made us kind of uncomfortable, but overall it was good."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Tornado Club in about 5 years but this was always the special occasion restaurant we frequented in college.  All of the steaks are excellent and well cooked.  They got some good beef in the midwest ya know.  This is the first place I tried venison and its been the best tasting and least gamey I've had anywhere.  The best dish on the menu here is the coquille st jacques (sp?).  The mashed potatoes, the scallops and the sauce are perfectly married and served elegantly on a cleaned out shell.  Its the perfect dish and many of my friends have ordered 2 - one as appetizer and another for main dish.  If you're a fan of frog legs and escargot you'll be happy to know these dishes also shine.  I guess anything with a lot of butter and garlic is bound to be good but these are especially lovely.    The last time I was ever there during graduation weekend a bat, yes a bat, started flying around the restaurant.  It got through an open window in our dining room.  You've never seen so many 21 year old guys jump underneath a table so quickly.  Anyway we eventually shooed the bat out the same window.  For our inconvenience we got free liquor and free desserts.  Not a bad deal for some starving hungry college kids."}
{"text":"(5 stars for late-night food; 1 star for cocktail hour = 3 overall)  Went for drinks with a few girlfriends late on a friday night.  The drinks that the waitress got right were great, but only 2 out of 6 being correct is pretty horrible.  After delivering the wrong drinks (and forgetting to bring 2), the waitress never returned to our table!  We were seated at the table for over an hour watching the waitress flirt with the bartender when we finally decided we would be better off going to the bar to order and pay our checks.  I would love to come back and try the late night menu, which had very reasonable prices and looks wonderful.  However, never making the mistake of going just for drinks again unless I can find a seat at the bar and steer clear of the waitresses.  UPDATE:  Went back to try the late night menu and the steak sandwich was great, my dining partner had a munster cheeseburger which she loved.  Also, the waitstaff was just fine this time so I am hoping that my first impression was just an unfortunate fluke!"}
{"text":"The best place to go to in Madison if you're craving a late night steak. Ambiance is awesome, feels classy but you definitely can come dressed casual if you're just hanging out in the bar/lounge area. The bartenders are friendly and will make you custom drinks if you ask. I've only had items off of their late night menu, so I can't really comment on the pricing for dinner. For the quality of the steak, the late night menu is very reasonably priced.   They serve beautifully cooked and seasoned meat, with several different options on the menu. The steak comes cooked with a giant onion ring, which imparts a great flavor and juiciness to the meat. The one thing I dislike is having to order fries or a side dish separately, but the portions are generous so I can't really complain. Cocktails are creative and delicious, but be warned that they are a bit expensive for Madison.   I recommend coming after a light (read: almost non-existent) dinner so you can splurge and really enjoy your late night meal. Come a little before 10pm so you can get a seat, and be prepared to spend about as much as you would on a moderately priced dinner."}
{"text":"Not fancy not pretentious at all (a bit dated decor) but a terrific restaurant walking distance from the WI Capitol. I had the rabbit, which was lightly fried and served in a mustard sauce which was awesome. Had a special soup, tomato with a fresh cheese, great. Served with fresh and ample breads, salads. Interesting wine and beer list, including local WI microbrew beer, I had a very good IPA. The place looks like the bar does a good business. Food and wine was not inexpensive but not too pricey, about $55 a person. I highly recommend this Madison steakhouse."}
{"text":"I love the bars 60's vibe with the comfortable high back white leather bar stools. Great service and nice wine list. This is a solid steak house known for its bone in filet mignon with hash browns. I especially appreciate that  a vegetable, soup or salad are included with every entree...However, for me, the sautéed rabbit is their shinny crown; lightly breaded with mustard bacon jus.  Really Devine!!! Did I mention fresh backed warm bread with the salad?"}
{"text":"Only experienced the Tornado Room but it was AMA-ZING. Tried the scallops in a clam shell and escargot in butter bread crumbs. My friends enjoyed their sidecar bevs. These were such delicious late night morsels and the ambiance is really cool-eclectic, colorful interesting light fixtures. We enjoyed it very much. The service was impeccable-prompt, efficient but chill. Can't wait to come back for the full experience. I've been told by the friend who brought us, that the steak is a must."}
{"text":"Sirloin stake.... Fantastic. The best I have ever tried..... The place is nice and always busy...."}
{"text":"For a broke college student, damn this place can be perfect. Yes, I've never had their normal meal, but I have had their late night menu like 4 or 5 times now and every, single time I am amazed. The food is mouth watering and the late night menu is so well priced. This place is easily my favorite restaurant in Madison. The service is great, ambience is awesome and again, the food to die for. The steak is nice and juicy, burgers are are what you never knew burgers could be, the soup so relaxing and tasty, the list goes on. If you're in Madison, do not leave without coming here. I warn you. You will have missed a great opportunity!"}
{"text":"Went here last night during my trip to epic.  They were very accommodating to My allergies (lactose ), and made the vegetables with oil instead of butter.  The 16oz filet was cooked perfect,  as was the string beans with almonds.  Great service and food. ..just a shady location  (lots of bums outside"}
{"text":"When stepping into Tornado Steak House, you feel as if your in the 1970's and you feel people should be smoking cigars. The atmosphere and wooden walls makes you feel as if you are in a movie.   To begin with, the service was fantastic. My boyfriend and I got served fresh baked bread basically right when we were seated. They have an extensive cocktail and wine menu to choose from. The cocktails are strong and it is so worth the splurge on them ($10-$12). In addition, our waitress was phenomenal and had great knowledge of the menu and wines. When we asked about the different wines to pair with our main dishes, she recommended 3-4 different types depending on our taste preferences.   Each entree comes with an appetizer salad and a side which is included in the price. Both my boyfriend and I got a ceasar salad to begin with, which was amazing. My boyfriend got the New York Strip steak with a baked potato. The potato came with butter and sour cream on the side. I got the salmon and a side of fries. At the end of the meal we were both stuffed."}
{"text":"Really good late-night menu. I went last night and got the salmon sandwich on greens because I am gluten-intolerant. They gladly accommodated me! I love the ambiance here too. Definitely hit up the Tornado Room if you are looking for an intimate vibe and great food."}
{"text":"A true Wisconsin steakhouse experience. Excellent service, uncomplicated menu, delicious food, and perfect ambiance.  This place is lovely."}
{"text":"The steak is ok.  Everything else is a miss. The entire table of Brussels sprouts is not eatable.  Undercooked. Appetizers are very heavy sauced and seafoods are meh.   The server said the desserts are made in house. They definitely don't have a proper trained pastry chef. It is at best university cafeteria standard.   NYC pricing but sub standard quality."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with my niece while in town for the Badger spring football game.  Great service, excellent food.  Relish glass and bread were brought to the table immediately - a nice 'old' touch.  Steaks were excellent.  Nice wine list.  Cozy place for dinner.  No complaints at all, I'd go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Ok I admit I only had one round of drinks here but I really want to come back and try the food.  I loved the dark, warm atmosphere and sharp-dressed, professional, friendly bartenders."}
{"text":"We went out to celebrate our anniversary last night.  I wanted to go to L'Etoile but Rhonda wanted to go to Tornado.  She won.  I am glad she won.  I am still recovering from a food coma.  It was absolutely amazing!  It is an old fashioned supper club.  Not a lot of lighting, very intimate.  The only complaint I had was the busier they got the louder it got.  There was a table of politicians across the room and they were really loud.  Everyone was trying to talk over them.  I am a big fan of the nightly specials.  Usually the chef puts a lot of their talent behind them.  The waiter we had was great.  As he was going through the specials you could tell he tried each of them and was very passionate about how good they were.  I ordered the appetiser special and the main course special.  We started with crab cakes made with king crab.  I thought I have had good crab cakes before but these were to die for.  Crispy on the outside and moist and creamy on the inside.  The sauce sealed the deal.  It was a rich sauce but you only needed a little to get the appropriate flavors.  Too bad it was a special.  If they were on the menu I would go back for them...It gets better.  Rhonda ordered an 8 oz filet with a baked potato.  I ordered the braised lamb shanks.  The waiter described them perfectly.  As my fork went into the meat it fell apart and went into the gravy, you could see how moist the meat was.  My eyes rolled into the back of my head as my taste buds exploded in flavor with the first bite.  I gave a fork full to Rhonda and she had the same reaction.  I love her to death and many times I have traded entrees with her because she liked mine better, not tonight.  I am keeping this one.  The lamb shank was served with elephant ear mushrooms and I choose brussel sprouts for a veg.  I felt selfish about keeping the meat so I gave the mushrooms to Rhonda.  She loved them.  Rhonda is big on dessert.  I always joke with her that she has two stomachs, one is specifically for dessert.  I was way too full to get one.  When the waiter came back and told us about the options, he paused and said the pineapple upside down cake was really good and his favorite.  Once he said that I had to get it.  He wasn't wrong up to this point.  When it came out it was pretty big.  I didn't know how I was going to finish it.  Rhonda ordered the custard and it was pretty small.  I knew she would help me.  I was in heaven after the first bite.  It was hot, not too sweet and gooey.  Rhonda finished her dessert then ate about half of mine.  I was glad because I wouldn't have been able to finish it.  Once we finished, the food coma set in.  I still feel full 12 hours later.  I couldn't believe how great the food was.  The waiter was amazing and you could tell he liked his job.  The way he described the food would make any chef feel proud.  The prices seemed high when we had the menus but the quality of food and the amounts given are well worth the cost.  We had multiple drinks and a ton of food and the bill was a little over $125.  We expected that and would have paid a lot more.  Knowing how great the meal was, we will be going back more often.  The restaurant was full for a Tuesday.  I suggest you make reservations.  I also suggest picking something besides steak.  Their steaks are good but try other items especially the specials.  Chefs put their heart and talents into them so you know they will be great."}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the Tornado. I could try but it just ain't happening. I frickin' love this place.   Now I wouldn't recommend pulling a stunt like me and never making a reservation but I personally have been able to get a table with almost no wait every time I have come here. Granted I have had to crush into one of those tiny cocktail booths with four people and eat with our plates balanced in our laps because of my lack of foresight but it was worth the trouble.   I love their Old Fashioned's (Bourbon for me, you'll get it with brandy if you don't specify) and on the occasions when I brought my mom there she loves their brandy stone sour (I've seen her order this old-school cocktail only to be met with a blank stare at many other places and the Tornado staff didn't bat an eyelash at her request)  This place is as old-school supper club as any place could get, dead animals and antique firearms on the walls and lots of dark, dark, wood decorate the interior.   I've tried several things on the menu including duck, prime rib, and pork chops and all of them have been huge and delicious. The best part of the supper club experience is that you get a relish \"tray\" (actually an icy pint glass) full of skewered pickles, olives, radishes, celery carrots etc. Bread basket with these dill rolls that I love and choice of soup or salad ( I LOVE their wedge which comes with \"Blue cheese French dressing\" ( not one but TWO different dressing swirled over the plate) and choice of potato (I can only comment that the hash brown is the size of a hubcap and the only potato that i ever have or ever will order at the Tornado)   I love their frog leg appetizer and the oysters Rockefeller were pretty darn good too.  Did I mention that their beef is organic?    and to top it all off you can head downstairs to the Corral Room on weekends for live music and more of their nicely priced bucket sized cocktails.   Love this place. I don't often make the trip out of town JUST to eat at a restaurant but the tornado deserves my efforts."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food was amazing. The atmosphere was fantastic and the people are super nice. The drinks were off last time I visited but it's still worth a five-star"}
{"text":"Yes! It's one of my favorite places in Madison. It's a go-to with an out of town guest. Great atmosphere and wonderful food!!!"}
{"text":"Always a good steak, never disappoints. Great service and good selection of single malts. Sirloin was prepared to perfection and shrimp in shrimp cocktail were huge. Even @ 9:00 pm on a Wednesday the Tornado was busy but the wait was short for a table. One of my favorite steak places in Madison."}
{"text":"Ok, I KNOW how loyal & traditional Madison natives are.....but, this was my third time here and I AM NOT IMPRESSED and won't go back.....I have NO problem paying good money for good food, but for an OK steak and undercooked veggies not for me.......I don't get why do many people live this place soo much?!? When the salad is the only good thing, I am and was disappointed.service was barely acceptable too...."}
{"text":"Been a few times for drinks. Love the 50 60s feel of the bar. Great drinks 2. Went tonight for dinner and we were both so disappointed. I had the lamb which had no lamb flavor at all. It was seasoned  but the meat had no flavor . The portion was great and it came on a sweet sauce. My son had the walleye. It seemed to have a type of corn flake breading but it was extremely soggy. I had the brussel sprout side which was hardly cooked. The french onion soup was the highlight of the dinner. Very disappointed for the prices."}
{"text":"Hands down - best steakhouse in Madison. Can't beat the food, service or location"}
{"text":"Late night menu... Yes!! Let me warn you though, on the weekends it starts at 10:30 instead of 10 during the weekdays. I usually order the sirloin, and most of the times, it's good. However, they need to get the timing right for how much you want your meat cooked. I always ask for medium rare. Sometimes it more rare, more often, it's more medium to medium well and I get really disappointed. But when it is done just right, it's pretty darn good. Also, I recommend the steak sandwich. A great deal and very tasty.   UPDATE: Recently went for late night on Saturday, and I was embarrassed I took my friends from out of town there. My guests and I arrived at 10:30, which is supposed to be the time they start late night.. however we were informed that it starts at 11 that night, which was fine. When we walked in, there was hardly anyone there. Around 10:45, the place was packed, but I thought it'd be fine since we were one of the first people there. WRONG, we got our food LAST at midnight. Also, my friends and I were served mini glasses of wine.. and when my guest reordered another wine, he got a larger glass filled more. For $9 a glass, I got a few sips... It was just absolutely disappointing. Ended up leaving at 12:30. The waitress, Olivia, said she was sorry.. and the reason for the delay for late night was for this very issue. To work out these kinks. And as other people who came AFTER us continued to get their food, she looked at me and goes, that's a good sign yours is coming next...... I just looked at her with disbelief. And you better bet nothing was comped."}
{"text":"Tornado Steak House it the type of place that can turn vegetarians back into meat eaters. It's where you take that special date, bond with clients for work dinners or gather a group of friends together for a night out. The great thing about Tornado is that is really appeals to everyone.  So far, I've been here twice this year and just visited for an early birthday celebration as I was going to be out of the country for work. In celebrating the my big 30, I wanted a nice dinner at a place that I knew I would get great service and amazing food. Tornado Steak House lived up to my expectations.  The restaurant itself is the type of dimly lit, sort of hidden from the street cozy steakhouse, which is what I love about the place. Upon entering from the front, you pass by the bar and head towards the back to where the hostess stand is. There are a few separate dining areas that can accommodate a couple or a large party.   To start, the table receives a relish dish (presented vertically) to snack on. On top of that, you get an assortment of breads as well. Although I would love to try their appetizers, I'm satisfied with both of these offerings and have to put down to bread because I already start to get full!  I ordered the 16oz sirloin with french onion soup and french fries. In the previous time I was here I had the same order but a side of hash browns. I prefer my steak medium well and both times never had any problems with how well it was cooked. The steak is topped with a giant onion ring. And when I say giant, I mean a thickly fried onion that covered the entire sirloin. It's almost a side order in itself and oh so good. Plus, it makes for an interesting presentation.  A to-go box was welcomed, as I was unable to finish my delicious steak. Steak for a throw together brunch meal the next day? Don't mind if I do.  We did order a few cocktails as well, so our total bill came out to a little over $100. Well worth it for the meal. If you are on a budget, they have a late night menu that everyone raves about. Also, if you are planning on ordering more than a couple of drinks, it may be worth it to just order a bottle of wine for the table. The drinks can add up quickly.  Service is amazing. Friendly and efficient. I drink more water than anyone I know, and it was constantly filled throughout my meal. To me this means they are adequately staffed and are paying attention to their customers.   I would absolutely recommend making reservations if you are planning in advance to eat here. One area I noticed this time is they have an outside patio area that looks nice during the summer as an option for seating. As some reviewers have noted, the place can get loud. However, that's the fun of this type of steakhouse. Everyone is out enjoying the company that they are with for a great meal.   Want a steak? Eat at Tornado. Don't want a steak? That's okay too. They have other entree offerings that I'm sure are just as good."}
{"text":"Good steaks, friendly service in a relaxed environment."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend as soon as it opened on a Monday night since we were going to a show at 7. I saw all the good reviews on yelp so we decided to check it out. From the outside, this place looks almost like a dive bar. Inside, it looks like a retro log cabin. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My boyfriend and I split the king crab legs and a 14oz filet mignon. The bacon spinach salad was AMAZING. Best cooked and flavored bacon I've had in a long time. Our entrees were equally as delicious. The crab tasted fresh and the steak was cooked perfectly. We were so full we couldn't even touch our baked potatoes, which were huge. Loved the food, would definitely go back when I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"Omg I love this place. Wonderful wine--the Malbec is excellent!  Sunday chicken dinner keeps me coming back. Half chicken was tender and moist. The stuffing and mashed potatoes are like your grandma made. Cashew chocolate pie is a decadent finishing touch. Servers feel a little snooty but the atmosphere is dark and casual. I'd go back, next Sunday!"}
{"text":"The steaks were great! We shared the ribeye, tenderloin, and lamb. They were all super tender, and I liked the ribeye the best. Very flavorful and also in a huge portion.  The French onion soup was amazing! The soup, onion, bread crumbs, and cheese all mixed well together, giving a very good texture. Also tried the pineapple upside down cake. It was very special, like sponge cake soaked with rum and baked with pineapple. But I guess it wasn't my type."}
{"text":"Woohoo!    What's my favorite dish in all of Madison you ask?  An 8 oz beef tenderloin filet, topped with a crispy onion ring.  Bravo Tornado Club!"}
{"text":"We went here for cocktails on a Thursday. Bar ambiance was awesome - old school decor, tunes, and drinks. Excellent. Back the following night for dinner ...bread top notch, glass of veggies -very good and unique...I tried the special filet ordered medium rare....I could not cut through it - I thought maybe too raw - sent back/ came back hotter but same bloody -tough cut....disappointing. I can't eat anything I can chew through. The salad - wedge - was excellent and HUGE. Sides were very good hash browns and mashed carrots compote. BF had walleye - excellent. Service was excellent - we were seated in a small room in between the dining room and bar which was fine with us - quiet and intimate..... Until a party of 10 college kids were seated next to us but we were done anyway. Overall very good - I was just unlucky with my filet.....:(  Also even though I didn't finish 1/2 of my steak we were both over full. Portions are very large."}
{"text":"This place is great! It has an old school feel to it with lots of character. I ordered the Bone-In New York Strip and did not regret my decision. Steak was cooked perfectly and had a nice char on the outside. It was also huge! I had a side of Brussels Sprouts, which were cooked perfectly and delicious.   Be sure and check out the bar area and have a drink before dinner. It's very cool and has these old style supper club booths. Definitely worth checking it out."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to bring friends and family for late night drinks and the delicious streak sandwich. So why a one star rating? On a visit last night, after one drink, my son was carded. Which is fine. The problem is that my son is a bar owner in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. But the server and others at the Tornado evidently are unaware of this basic geographical fact. They believed that a Puerto Rican state I.D. was false. There are many layers of stupidity involved here. But it's a very pathetic level of ignorance for a bar to not recognize \"foreign\" identification.  When it was pointed out to the manager by an attorney in this group that the manager was racist, the manager called the entire group of seven \"assholes\". There's more but it's for a civil suit to decide. In conclusion, if you're lily white and have a state I.D. from Wisconsin, you're ok. But if you're \"foreign\" or have darker skin....stay away. At least until the group protests are organized."}
{"text":"Wow, Tornado walks a fine line between old fashioned and retro cool and I think it does so perfectly!  Steak dinner isn't rocket science, and this place gets it right- good meat prepared properly.  All the little acompanyments are there, just like they did it in the '50s.  But the decor and staff and bar keep this place feeling fresher than some dusty old relic- Tornado is something special."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Tornado, and it was stellar! The 10oz pepper crusted filet was the best I've ever had, cooked to a perfect medium rare and the peppercorn sauce was really well executed. I had asked for the wedge salad chopped, and they kindly obliged me. Overall a great meal and the wine list, though not going to win any awards for size, has a lot of great selections (and reasonably priced). Add on a great server with a great sense of humor (can't remember her name), and it was an outstanding night."}
{"text":"This review is actually for the Corral Room....basically the basement of the Tornado Club.  Do me a favor and don't go here because I LOVE IT and it is tiny and cool and if everyone goes there it will be packed and loud.  Ok, that is selfish.  If you want to go back in time and enjoy a delicious strong drink this is the place for you.  Play some tunes on the jukebox and be king or queen of the castle in the cool booths.  Just save me a seat!"}
{"text":"Probably the 15th time I have been here since 1998. One of my favorite restaurants in the US. Roquefort salad is amazing. Bread was great. Crab legs amazing. Filet au poivre so good. Hashbrowns yummy and carrot cake SOOO good. The atmosphere is the coolest - dark wood with music from the 40' and 50's playing. I even love the thick cocktail glasses they use. If you are thinking of eating in Madtown and like steak I would not miss going here. Every time I am in town I make sure I eat here. Forgot to mention they have a super cool bar too!"}
{"text":"I love places that \"do\" a limited amount of things, but do them all well. Tornado Room is that place. ESPECIALLY their late night menu. Never had a bad item. Always on-point, and much better than other late night alternatives (see: Denny's, Perkin's, greasy options on State - Ian's excluded). Their wedge salad is the stuff of dreams."}
{"text":"I've eaten dinner here and while that was great this review is for the late night menu. I've lost count the number of steak sandwiches I've consumed. No better place to go with a group or a date late night than the basement of Tornado Room. They do sell out. You have been warned.   If it's cold and rainy get the french onion soup, but that might be taking up valuable real estate in your stomach for more steak sandwich.   They also have the best brandy Old Fashioned in town. I think they've changed their policy on giving out extra Luxardo cherries because of my date eating 6 in one sitting."}
{"text":"Went here for date night last weekend and had a really good time with some delicious food.  I would highly recommend having a reservation and being flexible once you show up. We went at 9pm without a reservation and were able to snag one of their bar booths after a round of drinks, but the host let us know that it was quite packed, which seems to be the case on a regular basis.  I ordered one of their craft beers on tap, they had about 4 to choose from.  For dinner, I got the Walleye. It was SO GOOD, better than any Friday fish fry I've had in Madison thus far (which is only a few). It came in a white wine sauce and ordered the Brussels sprouts as a side. The dinner entrees also came with a salad; I got the Caesar and really liked it, but would like to try their wedge salad next time I go.  Overall, it was a bit pricey, but the dinner price did include a salad and side. I had a great time and LOVED the food. Next time, I'll definitely make a reservation or try their late night menu!"}
{"text":"Summary:  Pretty good, but I'd never go back at these prices, and I felt bait-and-switched about the organic steaks.  The good:  A pleasantly old-school room, featuring way too many loud drunk people to be in any way romantic but at any rate atmospheric.  The loin of venison was really excellent, cooked just to a purple-red in the center, tender, moist, and woodsy.  The hash browns were simple but outstanding.  A gin-and-tonic-and-apple cider cocktail was just sweet and rich enough to be a great fall drink.  The bad:  the 14-ounce filet had a nice sear, but was somewhat lacking in flavor and moistness -- it wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to expectations at a high-end place like this.  Worse, Tornado's website advertises their steaks as organic, which was a big selling point for my wife; the waitress told us they weren't.  So either the web site is false or the waitstaff doesn't know what's being served; either one is a serious problem.  We enjoyed our dinner overall, but the prices here are pretty much the same as L'Etoile, and the food isn't close to that good.  Certainly the steak at L'Etoile is better, albeit smaller, than the one here."}
{"text":"The word on the street was entirely accurate -- this is the ultimate meat joint in town, hands down.  I hosted a group of foodie Sicilians from Chicago's south side -- each of whom had a very discerning taste for the finer things in life. After enjoying the shrimp cocktail and oyster appetizers, I dined on the salmon special while my guests each found a different steak or lamb entree to be more pleasing to their tastes. I was relieved to receive high compliments on my choice of dinner venues. [phew!]  Oh, and it's worth noting that the wine list also passed the test (two of my guests were well-traveled sommeliers)."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited this restaurant for our anniversary.  I loved the old school gangster atmosphere.  We entered through the bar area, and it was just the type of place that makes you want to sit right down and order a cocktail.  The dining room and overall ambience is right out of Goodfellas.  That's not to say the place can't use some renovations, as long as they don't mess with the winning formula.  My wife ordered a chocolate martini, and I ordered the \"movie star.\"  Both were appropriately strong!  We both started with spinach salads and warm bacon dressing.  We both thought that there was too much dressing and that it overpowered the salad.  The dinner bread was very good but we didn't want to eat too much of it.  Now I'm a steak snob and am very particular about my ribeyes.  Quite frankly I expected to be disappointed, but I would put Tornado's ribeye in my all time top 5.  It was very large (28oz including the bone), but it was nicely charred, perfectly prepared medium rare, and the quality of the meat was very high.    My wife's filet was less impressive.  It lacked tenderness and the flavor was very ordinary.  She received a much better filet at Johnny's Italian Steakhouse in Middleton.  (Note:  It's interesting that we've never been to a steakhouse that had BOTH a great ribeye AND a great filet.)  Our sides (hash browns and asparagus) were just OK.  We were too full for dessert and settled for another round of drinks in the bar.  Overall we enjoyed the restaurant.  We went for steak but I'm anxious to go back for Sunday chicken dinner.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my Go-To downtown Madison fine dining establishment. The main dining room is so unexpectedly Northwoods Cabin feeling! It's like dining in a log cabin with no windows.....but in a good way!  Went on a Sunday evening, when the daily special is herb chicken with dressing, potatoes, & green beans. It comes with bread, veggie/olive relish tray (in a glass) plus your choice of soup or salad. That's a huge amount of delicious food for a very reasonable price! After devouring a huge wedge salad, I could barely eat my chicken dinner. On the plus side: they neatly pack up your leftovers.   My dining mate tried the pork tenderloin with cherry sauce. He said it was decent but not exciting.  He started with the soup of the day: cream of wild mushroom with blue cheese...he enjoyed it. We were a little surprised both the soup & salads AND the two main meals took a bit too long to arrive. But the servers were very attentive and apologetic for the  delays."}
{"text":"My favorite steak in Madison!  I love the ambience and details they put into service.  From the assorted bread and veggies on ice.  The wedge salad is a beautiful work of art, a towering piece of ordinary iceberg lettuce transformed by luscious french dressing, sprinkled with blue cheese and ribbons of carrots perfectly cascading down the side of the iceberg mountain.  Hashbrowns crunchy and crispy on the outside; smooth and buttery velvet on the inside - I love butter.  Pan seared steaks always cooked to perfection.  I love a medium rare NY strip, my hubby on the other hand medium well sirloin with peppercorn crust.  Staff always ask if he knows what medium well is; he replies yes, and is always happy with the outcome.    For a while this winter they had a recession buster deal Sunday thru Thursday.  It was an outstanding deals, but I don't think they have it anymore."}
{"text":"Incredible steak.  Was in town for Epic, co-workers recommended and did not disappoint.  Ordered the T-Bone, medium rare, and was cooked perfectly.  Nice crust on the outside, just perfect on the inside."}
{"text":"The Tornado Room is a quality establishment through and through.  Nestled in the near-Capitol cove of Madison's downtown, you'd usually perceive it to be one of the typical college bars that surround it, but instead you're presented with a walk back in time to the nightclubs of days past.  The ambiance of an old-style nightclub is perfectly created from the Frank Sinatra-isk music to the tiny tables surrounded by big circular booths.  You've also got the low lighting, pleasant conversation, an old-style bar, and the aroma of juicy steak.  It literally feels like you're in an episode of Mad Men when you sit down at this restaurant.  One of my friends said that he thought it felt very Wisconsin-Authentic, and I think that claim is deserved as you get some of the down to earth feel with all the casual conversation and comfort eats.  I've been twice so far; the first time I went with a party of about 8-10 people for dinner, and was treated to one of the best filet mingon's I have ever had.  I love good steak, and I feel if you are going to eat steak you should go all out because otherwise you could probably just get a good burger instead.  This is definitely the joint to splurge on, as the reward is a slice of succulence.  The second time I went, it was with 3-4 friends for drinks and a social hour.  The tables are well suited for this, as the circular design and center-table focal point keep you all within close range for conversation.  They're not terribly accommodating space-wise, but the good conversation promoted by this setup allows for one to ignore that aspect.  Waitresses that I've had were very cordial, timely, and pulled just the right moves to ensure that they would be receiving a generous tip.  All of us had a great time, and would definitely go back again.  If there's any drawback of the Tornado Room, it's that the prices are steep.  This is certainly not a place you would go to every weekend, unless of course your making six figures and blow your nose with $100 bills.  But it IS a steakhouse afterall, so the prices are respective to the quality of service that is received."}
{"text":"My boyfriend suggested dinner at Tornado for our 4th anniversary. I'm glad I agreed.  One of the top reasons we chose to dine here was the service and as always it was excellent; attentive but not overbearing, personable, no pretension. Perfect. Of course the food and drinks were top quality too.  My boyfriend was excited to find his favorite tomato soup on that night's menu and I chose the french onion, both were delicious. Our steaks were perfectly cooked.  A great dining experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Tornado and have dined here several times. The steaks are always large and prepared perfectly.  The bar area is classic 60's lounge with round leather booths. The staff is welcoming and very professional. The dining area can be somewhat loud. It's rustic in appearance. The wine selection is fairly good, with lots of \"by the glass\" selections but the \"by the bottle\" choices are quite good. I was disappointed that I could not get a Spanish Temperanillo at my last visit but such is life.  I'd highly recommend the Tornado. A great place for steaks."}
{"text":"For the price, I would go somewhere else.  The service was excellent so I want to give them more stars. But for the same price, I'd rather go somewhere with a bit more diversity in their menu, from dishes to wines. Ok, their shrimp cocktail is good, their escargot is great (I don't know anywhere else in Madison I can get the same quality). However, the steaks? They are good, but I'm surprised they didn't have any dry-aged steaks.   The breads are delicious.  Ok the wine list. It has so much potential but for a fancy place like Tornado Steak House, I wish they had some more variety.   It's a good place, I've been here multiple times, actually, and each time I always feel like they're missing just one thing. I still recommend it, but not quite the place I'd keep returning to when I have the chance."}
{"text":"Still five stars.  The place just makes good, steakhouse food."}
{"text":"Just wow... I can't get enough of this place. Excellent for large groups, or a dinner for 2. The food is high quality and delicious. I travel to WI yearly for work and this place is ALWAYS on my list of \"to do's\"."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing cuisine.  The appetizer, entree, and dessert, all of it, was one of the best meals I ever had.  The duck was melt in your mouth, tender goodness.  So good, I think I might go buy some duck this week just to see if I can replicate it.  It's also worth pointing out that the environment only adds to the great cuisine.  Very dim and low key.  I felt like I was in an episode of Mad Men.    Service however, was not as efficient as I'd hoped.  Don't get me wrong, very friendly staff, but very slow to get to the table.  Still, most definitely recommend for many formal occasions."}
{"text":"A classic steakhouse.  Stop by around 7:30 for a well prepared cut of meat.  Swing back around midnight for drink from their more than adequate bar and grab a quick snack from the late night menu."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary a few days ago. The bread was tasty. The soup of the day, broccoli beer cheese, sounded delicious but was disappointing. Our server seemed distracted and a bit condescending. My steak was good tasting and done just the way I like it, and the brussel sprouts were perfect.  Boyfriend was disappointed with his lobster tail.   We have also come for their late-night menu after shows at the frequency and love the food they offer then!"}
{"text":"Kind of a weird entrance.  They have two and if you choose the wrong one, you come in at the end of the bar.  We chose wrong but the staff was polite to point us in the right direction.  Seated promptly and the service was great.  Fantastic special drink choices and extensive wine selection.  I ordered the peppercorn filet with mushroom sauce...... Fantastic.  The other dish was 1 1/2 king crab legs.  Everything was cooked to perfection and served in a timely manner.   Many thanks to our hotel staff for their recommendation.  I see why the said we should try it and so should you....!!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Madison.  ALWAYS GOOD.  Best steaks and seafood.  Great service.  Only complaint is it is difficult to get reservations."}
{"text":"Less than impressed with Tornado-used to be a favorite now just over rated and over priced and filled with annoying-hipster  millennials wearing their wool caps during dinner talking loudly about anal sex and blowjobs while their girlfriends screeched over them! The chef apparently found garlic salt as his new Magic ingredient and everything was covered in it! Three of the steaks ordered weren't cooked correctly and the broccolini side the waitress raved about in her opening remarks was sold out by the time she made it back to our table to take our order...meh! Back to Fleming's!"}
{"text":"Probably the best steak place in Madison.  Great atmosphere - old school supper club, but younger waitstaff and a great bar.  Very close to the square, so a great place to start the night.  Do not miss the late night menu (10PM-1AM) - the food sandwiches are fantastic and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I had not been to Tornado in over a decade because my first experience there was that it was one of the most overrated restaurants I had ever been to. Recently a friend of mine told me to give it another shot. So my wife and I did just that. Wow. Fantastic. Fantastic food and fantastic service. I had the scallop appetizer, bleu cheese salad, hash browns and a medium-rare sirloin. Everything was great. The sirloin was out of this world good. Sooooooo looking forward to going back. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the Friday night perch fish fry that my wife ordered was awful. Soggy, fishy fish. Really nasty. After trying a bite I believe I'd rather get the fish at Culver's. LOL. No kidding! That being said, we will go back and this time my wife knows to order a steak."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time here. If you don't make a reservation you might luck out if you get there early and sit at one of the tables by the bar. I had French onion soup and salmon with baked potato. My husband had steak with the has browns. Both were very good. The waitress was also good"}
{"text":"The one restaurant in Madison I just keep coming back to. I've only ever been for the late night menu and I have a policy against ordering anything besides the $13 sirloin- it would be downright sinful. I haven't had a better steak since living in Madison, and I imagine the only way I would is if I came a little earlier for the full menu. But who can resist an 8 oz steak for $13?!?! My boyfriend usually gets the scallops, and sometimes we share. The scallops are really wonderful, too, and come with three scallops with a great cream sauce on a bed of mashed potatoes in a scallop shell. Yes, I've stolen the scalloped shell dish on several occasions. I try to convince everyone I go with to get the sirloin, but my best friend would always get the salmon sandwich or steak sandwich and raved about both.  The Tornado Room reminds you of a smoker's lounge in the fifties (not that I've been to one), it's very dark and antique looking. When you go in late night, you seat yourself at whatever table is available. There's an upstairs and downstairs, but it can sometimes be a little bit of a wait to get a table, especially if you're there with a  group. There's really only one table that will accommodate a group larger than 4/5, so you kind of have to get lucky.... we always have."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Madison. Period.  Drinks are outstanding, service is excellent, food is amazing.  Their french onion soup is the best in town!  Reservations highly suggested, but a wait in the bar won't disappoint either...their Coquille Saint Jacques is worth every penny (and calorie) while you wait!"}
{"text":"Great place to explore new food or drinks, but also offers incredibly comforting food. In all honesty, it's far too romantic not to take a date.   Try the escargot. Don't be scared"}
{"text":"I've been to Tornado twice now. Both for birthdays celebrations, and both fantastic!   On both occasions I felt like everything was moving at a slower than usual pace. From drinks to appetizers to meal, it was slow and drawn out. Maybe that's the point here? I don't know. Our meal this evening with a group of 8 was roughly 2.25 hours start to finish.   I wasn't in a hurry either time, so that doesn't really matter to me. Just keep in mind upon visiting, it wont be a quick ordeal.  Service, however, was amazing both times. The wait staff is on point, for sure. Aside from slow delivery of food (and they were busy) everything was great!  The food itself... omg. So good. I had salmon the first visit and filet the second. Both were incredible. The filet was some of the best steak I've had in Madison, hands down. I had asparagus the first visit and Brussels sprouts the second as my sides - both wonderful and cooked perfectly. Daily soup offerings were potato and then crab bisque. Both were very good. The bisque - excellent.   Overall - do I recommend checking this place out? YES. You will not be disappointed. I am a fan!  Final note - bathrooms suck. Small, old, cramped. If I am paying $60 for a steak, give me a nice restroom please."}
{"text":"I ate at Tornado Steakhouse tonight (7/9/14) and it was fantastic. I got the 16 oz. NY strip steak with a baked potato and the cheese cake for dessert.  The bread was pretty good. I didn't cut into the loaf, but at the biscuit.  The steak dinner came with choice of salad or soup and steak and with a side.  I went with the mixed greens with balsamic vinaigrette.  The dressing was already applied when it was served. I enjoyed the salad but I can imagine there would be some that want more dressing.  I got a baked potato with my steak instead of vegetables.  It was a typical baked potato, which was just fine with me.  The steak was a choice grade steak and it wasn't dry aged, but it was excellent.  The strip steak was narrow, but thick ( ~2 inches) and cooked perfectly.  In all honestly I think the steak I had at Johnny Delmonico's (JD's) down the street had a better flavor, but that's John my cause it was dry agside I wish Tornado Steakhouse would offer a dry aged steak.  For dessert I got the cheesecake, which is made in house.  It had a few blackberries on the side but no sauce.  For me that was great.  Like BBQ and steak if cheesecake is good it doesn't need a sauce. It was thick and creamy with great flavor.  I gave Tornado Steakhouse 5 stars because the food was great and the price was"}
{"text":"Had escargot for the first time .. Interesting not sure ill ever try that again but the salmon was good"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Tornado Room for any and every special occasion. Our most recent was for our anniversary. We simply had drinks and appetizers at the bar. It was during the Dairy Expo, which is a very busy week for them. The bartenders were as friendly as ever and even took the time to help me choose the right glass of wine to go with the Cocquille St Jacques; which was AMAZING! Tornado, you never disappoint! Thanks for memories!!"}
{"text":"The gold standard ultimate steak:   The Tornado Bone in Tenderloin.  And that gold standard is held against Chicago, Vegas, and steak everywhere. Hard to go anywhere else for steak in town.  My happy place is the Tornado bar with a cocktail."}
