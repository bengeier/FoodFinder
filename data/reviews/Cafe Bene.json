{"text":"I got the injeolmi bingsu with one other friend to split, and it was super good! The portion size is a bit too big for two people who had just ate lunch, but it was really delicious and we finished the dessert. The atmosphere is nice and quiet too, I would recommend coming here if you're craving korean shaved ice!"}
{"text":"coming out of kbbq, I was looking for something sweet to end the night.  headed down south on Yonge st  and made a pit stop here at this cafe.  didn't really get a chance to read any reviews on this place but decided to make my way up to the second floor to give this a try.  pictures in the menu looked pretty good but it was actually very deceiving.    let's start with the hot drinks.  I always wanted to go to a place where they will make a little image in my cup of coffee/latte and was a bit excited that pictures in the menu had this here.  I saw a tree, leaf, happy face etc.  in a nice big cup.  as you can see in my picture I took, not only did it not come with a little image in it, it came in a small to go type of cup.  taste wise, like a vending machine but I actually didn't mind, I liked it.    to the cake, don't let my picture fool you.  the size of the cake was the size of my middle and index fingers put together.  taste wise, straight out of a grocery store type of cake.  and not the higher end grocery stores, more like price chopper style.  but again, I actually didn't mind.  what I did mind was the price tag that was attached to it.  it was $12.99 for the drink and cake combo.    to recap,  to go type of cup drink with vending machine taste like quality and 2 fingers size low end grocery store quality piece of cake with high end cafe prices.  and I forgot to mention the table we had.  we were sandwiched between 2 other tables against a half wall and had a fake plant over hang us with its fake branch half way on to our table.  too bad I'm bad a describing the actual setting we were in, should've taken a picture (it is worth a thousand words).  so based on the above description, this place should get no more than 2 stars.  but you know what,  the waitress had a nice smile and was friendly.  this made all the difference in the world.  will I come back... probably not.  maybe it was just tonight or my luck with the food/beverage.  but hard to come back here when there are so many other options in area."}
{"text":"My new fav place in the world! The green tea bingsoo blew my mind away. Better than I thought it would. My friend and I went here for the first time on a Sunday afternoon and it's seriously the cutest place. I would love to come here and just hang out and chill."}
{"text":"Mango shaved ice and rice cake shaved ice were awesome. Shaved ice were milk based, toppings on the shaved ice were tasty! It was a bit pricy, $9.99 per bowl but they were filling. I suggest you share one bowl of ice and get something small on the side if you have 2 people."}
{"text":"Bad desserts and bad customer service. Period."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night with two friends wanting to try it out since we pass by it all the time. The interior is super cute, comfy and cozy! It was busy and we had to wait a little bit before we were seated.   I wish my initial good impression continued throughout our meal, but it didn't at all. We ordered a pasta, a crepe and a slush. We did originally come for the patbingsu but we craved different things once we looked at the menu.   The pasta came first and it was good! It's an Asian-style tomato (ketchup?) pasta with a fair amount of meatballs. However, the pasta took half an hour to come and my parking ran out while we were eating. The slush came at around the same time.   What's ridiculous is that the crepe didn't come until another half hour passed! We couldn't get the attention of any server so my friend went up and asked and the server simply replied, \"it's right here! We're making it now.\"   If the crepe was amazing, I'd give this place a positive review despite the extreme wait time but it was horrible. I'm not sure it can even be classified as a crepe since it was so thick it was like a pancake instead. It looked like a hot mess with froot loops sprinkled randomly, Nutella smeared on only some parts of the \"crepe\" and ice cream that was already half melted when it arrived. So. Disappointed.  The washroom was also disgusting, the floor was completely covered with dirty water. It may be winter right now, but it was not a slushy winter day when we went.   I really wanted to like this place but no matter how good the patbingsu may be, I don't think I'll be coming back. We spent two hours here (not by choice!), and it's too much for too little."}
{"text":"It's surprisingly good. We tried their mango shaved ice dessert, new york cheesecake, marble cheesecake, tea & lattè. Between the two cheesecakes, New York tastes better. Its texture is smooth and it's not salty, just perfectly baked. As for the lattè, it's not as good as Starbucks' or other coffee shops, but it's acceptable. And one of the best desserts we've tried was their Mango Shaved Ice. It's devilishly good. Smooth and flavourful. The place is cozy with friendly staff. We'll definitely come visit this place again."}
{"text":"The decor is very cute and cozy. I went during the evening and it wasn't too loud. It's a nice place to catch up with friends or go on a simple date. I ordered a peach bubbletea with tapioca. Unfortunately, the bubbletea tasted powdery and artificial. The tapioca was hard and flavourless. Thankfully, the server was very understanding and kind enough to change my order. I got the original milk black tea instead. The flavour was better but not good enough. If you want some good bubbletea, stick to Chatime."}
{"text":"I really like how private the places are. The tables faced different ways and there are wall divisors everywhere, so you can't really spy on people from other tables unless you try. I can see it as a nice place to study although the lighting is kinda dim.   I got the injeolmi shaved ice. It tastes more nutty than what I'm used to. The portion is big. Also tried the sweet potato latte and I really liked it. It's my first time drinking sweet potato and i was kinda surprised at how sweet potato taste good as desserts."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday evening with the fam to check out the shaved ice options.  Slightly hard to find if you are not familiar with the area - the actual cafe is upstairs and visible only from the street by green cafe bene signage. We were lucky to finding parking right outside but if not I believe there's parking in street behind Cafe.   Cafe is small but still spots available for the 5 of us that evening without any wait.  Staff were quite nice and though it looked like a place more for young kids I found it was pretty family friendly! The wait was abit longer than I would expect to order but I suspect that these places it's a given. If not, then that would be one reco for improvement.   We decided to share: rice cake shaved ice, mango shaved ice, strawberry shaved ice and finally the sweet potato hot latte. Tried to order spaghetti but found out that it would be 30-40 min wait as they were just making the sauce so just skipped it - after all we were here mainly for shaved ice.  It was unanimous that the shaved ice was a hit. Kids wolfed it down quickly so while the portions are pretty big like another yelper noted, I seriously think the our boys aged 5, 8, 11 could have order their own.  Next time.  The only disappointment was that the sweet potato latte was lacking in taste. Maybe bc I unfortunately compare to the SP latte in LA (Heyri Cafe brings back good memories!) this one tasted more artificial without as much taste. Wouldn't order it again next time that's all.  Nevertheless, loved that the staff were sweet to take extra care to make sure that walnuts were not added to the rice cake shaved ice - our son has a peanut/Pinenut allergy and thy took extra precautions for us with nuts in general.  Final verdict - would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I came here about a year ago. I just got Yelp, which explains why i'm writing this review so late.   I remember having a bad experience, hence I couldn't give up not writing this review ;) The decor of the place was nice. When you first walk in, the hallway seems to be narrow. All I remember is that our table was situated fairly close to the next. This was awkward considering the people beside us were on a date. I guess the seating area could have been more spacious.   When we sat down and ordered from the menu, there were a lot of items that the cafe did not have anymore. This was frustrating because it was like, \"ok, then you tell me what you do have\". Why would you keep items (notice the plural) on the menu with pictures, if you guys don't carry it anymore. The service was bad and they forgot one of our orders. Not impressed. In the end we just stuck to an expensive cup noodle because we were hungry and didn't want to keep relocating (since we had our laptops and all). Well, that was an unfortunate experience. I didn't get much studying done and actually left soon after."}
{"text":"service, food, everything was great--especially the atmosphere. super cosy and easily my (and many of my friends') favourite cafe in the area  try out the cinnamon honey brick bread and their bingsoo! this is the only cafe so far in toronto that serves shaved milk (instead of regular water which makes it extra creamy and delicious). their servings are always very large so going with a friend is recommended but not necessary.   if you're looking for drinks, their sweet potato latte is the best I've had in toronto and as for cold drinks, all of their bubble teas are very nice  would definitely recommend to try out for anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews that I've read here, I thought I should give this cafe a try.  The interior of the cafe felt cozy, and lady who served me was nice. When asked she explained my orders in detail. Eventually, I got the New York Cheesecake (first page of the menu at the bottom) For a first try I would say that I really enjoyed it and felt that the prices are fair considering the portion given. Overall, I'm satisfied with the experience that i had and would have another visit!"}
{"text":"Cafe Bene was really quite and nice. The service was good and the food looked really appealing. We ordered the Oreo waffles which tasted okay but for some reason we got it without the sparkle stick. Felt a bit downgraded."}
{"text":"Super yummy ice shaved ice! We ordered one matcha Oreo and one mango, both are amazing. Just so slow...and if you get there late, they might sold out lots of their best sellers such as rice cake shaved ice."}
{"text":"Cute cafe on the second floor. Well hidden. Got a section for our group and it was nice and secluded (kinda). Ordered the red bean shaved ice. The shaved ice are called snowflakes... And when it arrived the ice was really fluffy and snowflake like. I like it better than the normal Taiwanese shaved iced. Then we noticed that there's a $3 surcharge if you share your food and don't get your own items. So ordered a toast brick. Average. But overall service was good and the snowflake was very good. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I've been there twice, neither times during peak hours. The first time the service was very very slow even though the cafe didn't seem that busy, but the second time was quite fast.  Both times, I loved the shaved ice! The first time I got the soybean powder and red bean and tried a friend's Oreo. The second time I tried soybean powder and red bean again, mango, green tea Oreo and brownie. I personally loved all of them! For the price (around $10), the portion sizes were great (approximately 2 people can share one) and the taste was also awesome. I've been to some other shaved ice places but this is my favourite.   The setting is a little cramped for larger groups but it's not too bad. The decor gives off a cozy, casual vibe, and it's a good volume for conversation. Neither times were too loud."}
{"text":"They messed up my order several times and I found a rubber band in my food. This place was awful, never going back. I ordered a cold white chocolate latte and a fruit waffle. The drink and especially the waffle took forever to get to the table. Then they gave me a hot chocolate so I sent it back for what I ordered. They gave me a cold drink which tasted good but it wasn't what I ordered. I wasn't going to send it back again. So I was drinking it and another waitress comes with what I actually ordered, which didn't taste good and she already took away the good drink that I didn't order. About 15 mins later the waffle finally comes. I'm eating it and then I find a rubber band in it so I sent it back and I asked them for another one. Took like half an hour until I got it. Didn't even feel like eating it anymore so I didn't finish it. Overall had a bad experience, the food was mediocre and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Cafe Bene is a Korean style dessert cafe located at Yonge and Finch. It is a chain from Seoul, that specializes in drinks, however the location in Canada seems to be more dessert focused.   I have an issue with this place. They have a giant sandwich board under neath the counter advertising their \"bingsu\" aka Korean shaved ice as being from \"Sulbing\" (The King of Bingsu in Korea). This got me excited as I have not had Sulbing since I lived in Seoul in 2014. I asked the girl working whether or not in fact they server the real Sulbing however she did not understand my question. She said, yes, we serve Bingsu, and its good. Her answer seemed suspect, so I had a feeling it was not the real deal (Rae Sremmurd voice).   She led us down a narrow hallway to our table which was odd. There was a bright light fixture hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the table. The light was so bright that it was blinding. We tried moving our table but it was bolted to the ground so we just moved to a different one.  The mango bingsu was good. Not the real deal from Korea, but decent for Toronto standards. The shaved ice is made from milk, snow and sugar. The mango topping is a mix from artificial mango marinated in a syrup, with real mangos that were not very ripe. I am forgiving because its January and only someone crazy likes me eats bingsu in January.   Well, ok, our Winter thus far has been quite soft, so maybe I'm not that crazy.   3/5"}
{"text":"I went there cause I was expecting good bingsu/shaved ice. It was a big disappointment. Small portion with way too much ice. The same kind I had in Soul Café a few days ago was much better.   Got a latte as well which had a pretty lazy artwork made with some kind of caramel syrup. Coffee is so overpriced, Starbucks feels cheap in comparison! $3.5 for an Americano?! Give me a break! Everything else is $4 and over and comes in one size. That might be understandable if they had some amazing coffee but they don't.  The only good thing about it is the interior which is kind of cute, but the place tries too hard to appear more than it actually is. I'm not a student anymore so if they can't serve good food/drinks then I'll look somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been here for bingsu a few times and i've never had any complaints. But this time we ordered Injeolmi, Brownie choco and Oreo/Greentea.   Injeolmi was good. Delicious, but who can mess up injeolmi?!   Oreo/Greentea was meh. Not yummy but not disgusting just strange. Maybe it's because of oreo bits in it, but the texture of the bingsu is like little eating little grains. As if they sprinkled sugar all over the snow. When I eat bingsu, i'm expecting smooth and fluffy snow, not crunchy and grainy snow. But overall the flavour wasn't bad.   The Brownie choco though, was disgusting. Same texture as the green tea, grainy and crunchy. But the toppings. Brownie bits weren't even good. Clearly brownies that you can buy at walmart in a box. Which is not a problem, BUT it's not even the good kind of brownies? I just don't understand how they could serve that. Definitely do not get"}
{"text":"Located on the upper floor of a building with great decor.   We were craving something sweet after having korean food down the street and the pictures of the shaved ice here looked utterly delectable (I regret only taking pictures for snapchat now..)   Anyways, the shaved ice here is probably the best I've ever had. It's sweeter than most (seems the condensed milk is mixed within the ice), but I love it. I believe I had the oreo green tea one? At least, I think that's what it was called or close enough. I do wish I had enough of an appetite to try another kind though.. Haha.   Will surely return to try new flavors and definitely will take and save picture next time."}
{"text":"I do love going to cafe's and this is one of them.  With a very friendly staff with a nice smile located on the 2nd floor a little hidden but once you go in, you hear the sounds of Korean songs playing but not upbeat but more relaxing kind? (I don't make sense)  The food is delicious though it is kinda pricey for me. I guess I like small cafe's that have that comfort feel and this cafe does have that!   would I come back? yes I would every now and then but not often."}
{"text":"Came here in a Wednesday evening. The shop is a bit hidden as they have a shared entrance with a medical shop and a pub downstairs. They only have a street sign with their specials on it which prompted my decision to go there. Once walking in, it's quite cramped in there. They have wooden booths maybe around 6-10 tables. We got a table in the back for 4. The waitress quickly came to our table to take our order. We ended up going with the shaved ice. I got matcha and Oreo. I believe around $10.99. It was quite a large bowl that should be shared between 2 people. The flavor was really good. Shaved bits of Oreo was great!! And it was really really hot so the shaved iced was perfect. However I felt the dish was only flavorful at the top where all the toppings were. Once you get to the middle it doesn't taste like anything since Its just shaved ice.  Service was not too great we got a round of water in the beginning but I was so thirsty I finished mine while waiting for my dessert. We did not get any refills, luckily I brought my own water bottle. Also the waitress took away our service button once we ordered so there was no way for us to get their attention for water or get out bill. We ended having to go to the front to pay after waiting 10 min for someone.   Overall the dish is great on a hot day but service is not good here."}
{"text":"This place has very good korean style bingsoo (shaved ice).  Nice small little cafe at Yonge and Finch. I tried the strawberry shaved ice. Went back a week later also tried the green apple grape shaved ice. Love this place.  If you post a picture of their shaved ice on instagram you will get 10% off."}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --  I had a sudden craving for Korean style dessert. Since I was around Yonge and Finch, I checked Yelp and found out this Cafe had a 3.5 rating and decided to give it a try. The entrance was quite hard to find since Cafe Bene was located on the second floor. The interior decor looked nice but the restaurant was very hot. I was non-stop sweating until I left the cafe.  -- Food and Drink --  We ordered 2 items:   1. Oreo Coco Bingsoo - a scoop of chocolate icecream and whipped cream layered over oreo crumbs on top of shaved ice made with milk. I normally eat Taiwanese/ Chinese shaved ice and it's usually tasteless. I liked how the Korean shaved ice has some flavor to it. The melted chocolate icecream and the milk shaved ice mixed well together. The oreo crumbs added a layer of crunchiness to the dessert. The dessert was huge and you can definitely share it.  2. Caramel Cheesecake - it was an average cheesecake. Nothing special. The cheesecake was way beyond sweet. I would rather try a less sweet dessert.   -- Overall --  Originally we wanted to try their crepes and other cakes. However, they told us they didn't have any crepes and some other cakes we liked. I was quite surprised they ran out of food on a Friday evening. Also, it took us for more than 15 minutes to wait for someone to come and take our order, servers were not very helpful. I would revisit if their service improves."}
{"text":"I came here for one thing and that is the Korean ice shaved dessert (bingsoo). I've also tried their bubble but it's not as good as their shaved ice. The bubble tea was alright but I think if you want bubble tea, there are many other places around that area that serves better bubble. I like coming here for the shaved ice because they have more of a variety compared to soban and they loaded it up with a bunch of toppings. I got the green tea and the sweet potato. Love the sweet potato and can't wait to try other flavours!"}
{"text":"I liked the service of this place and the 10% discount when you fb or instagram. But I didn't find the oreo matcha shaved ice to be as flavourful as I hoped. I would want more toppings and less shaved ice."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and I really love the environment. It is small and cozy,  it it is also very private because it has wooden separates around some tables.   It is a great place for students to study as well because there are outlets everywhere and their work is fast since not a lot of people are there using it. They also let us play cards here which is nice since a lot of cafes do not allow this (gambling reasons).   The only thing is that finding parking is difficult, especially before 9pm. There is a 2 hour maximum parking at metro which is around a 5 minute walk but park at own risk!  As for food, their volcano waffle is really cool but it didn't actually taste as good as it looks. This time, I got the white chocolate mocha bingsoo and my friend got the mango bingsoo. Mine had bananas and cornflakes, it is definitely worth to try. My friend didn't like her's because her mangos were frozen and too sour. The syrup tasted really artificial as well.   This place is a little bit hidden, you have to walk up a small staircase at the entrance of a wings restaurant."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes to be seated when it was almost empty.   Waited 40 mins for some mediocre bingsoo.  Waited another minutes for the server to bring us spoons.  You're better off going somewhere else, unless you only care about the ? part of bingsoo and have all the time in the world."}
{"text":"There are hidden bars and restaurants supposedly all over the city( perhaps too well hidden). Cafe Bene kind of feels like a hidden bubble tea/dessert place since from the outside you wouldn't think anything interesting was contained behind it's bland glass exterior.   This place was a pleasant surprise, and an absolute gem of a place.   1. cool space. the decor is interesting, and the whole space has dividers so there is quite a bit of privacy.   2. the snow flake desserts are the best of it's kind in the city.   3. fast internet  This is an awesome place to study/catch up with friends/eat something you aren't likely to find anywhere else in the city."}
{"text":"*2.5 stars* I like how the place is spacious, cozy and has plugs everywhere so it's good for studying BUT I find the prices ridiculously overpriced though for their food. It's slightly absurd to me how a bowl of instant ramen is like $3 when it's $0.50 a bowl at the Asian supermarket, (what?). Service is quick but quite impersonal/cold. Their drinks are standard bubble tea cafe price and decent but not amazing, but I'd go somewhere more legit next time (somewhere Taiwanese as opposed to a Korean BBT cafe such as Green Grotto or Gong Cha)."}
{"text":"I have seen glowing reviews about Cafe Bene in South Korea  via YouTube, but the one here in Toronto does it a little differently.  To be frank, there really isn't anything remarkable about Cafe Bene.    Pros:  It's open late at night and is a few metres away from Finch Station, so it's a relatively great place to grab some late night sugar before hopping onto the train/bus. Decor-wise, it has a natural theme with wooden furniture and dim lighting.  With many of the spaces sectioned off into booths, it is designed well for dates and other occasions with more intimate conversation.   Cons:  However, the food is average and the traffic of clients seems to be quite slow, even at 9-10pm.  With their most popular items being the bingsoos, we ordered the oreo green tea bingsoo and the rice cake bingsoo (injeolmi).  Portion to price-wise, you get what would seem like a regular size at Snow Time for 10-11 dollars, so I would say it's a little on the smaller size.  The flavours of the various ingredients didn't really meld together as well as I would have liked them to and the ice was not the smoothest.  They were average bingsoos without the frills, but you could really up the ante by going elsewhere."}
{"text":"The decor is cute and dainty, food is not up to par though. The ice cream waffles are very dense and dry, seems like they just toasted a frozen waffle. But the service is good. For the money, there are way better places around."}
{"text":"Quick update. They got rid of the PS3 private rooms (Nooo!). I get it though. They were taking too much space. On the bright side the place is spacier now and there are more available plugs to charge up your devices.  Otherwise it's the same menu and nothing else changed. Check out my previous review."}
{"text":"Located south of Yonge & Finch, cramped near H-Mart, Lim Ga Ne, Hot Star Large Fried Chicken, on the 2nd floor lies Cafe Bene. They offer a cozy but small cafe. While they sell some other desserts, and other miscellaneous stuff, their bingsu/shaved ice is the first thing you should get. They have tables for 2 and 4 people; the tight space wouldn't make me pick this place if I had a group of 5 or more.   Food ***** On par with \"The Cups\" for best bingsu/shaved ice in Toronto.  Bingsu is a popular Korean shaved ice dessert with sweet toppings like strawberries, mango, or nuts. They are reasonably priced for the portion and taste you get. No small size for their bingsus.  Service *** Service was pretty good, kind, and attentive but seems that when it got busier it was harder to get a hold of them   Ambiance **** Decorated really well with the amount of space they have, it's a cute place to take a date to with big plants and wooden interiors with tv's playing Korean music or shows. Their places are private and is good for people who want their privacy.  Tips/Closing comments - Good for 2-4 people hangouts  - Cute place to take a date to (With shaved ice being a twist over the usual ice cream dates) - You must order 1 item per person being there. If not, there is a $3 charge - Try their Injeolmi Bingsu!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for years now, but didn't have a chance to do until recently...  it was certainly not worth the prolonged wait.  My issue isn't with the decor or staff, but with God awful drink I had to awkwardly sip during my time there.  Thought I ordered an oreo milk tea, but received a block of ice with half a cookie sitting on top at a hefty price tag of $6 - talk about let down of the year.  Considering the nature of the yelp reviews boucing between ratings, it clear that this place is a great example of hit or miss.  Would love to come back to check out the private rooms or order shaved ice, but it may be a while...  at least until my wallet stops sighing."}
{"text":"I arrived at this place on a thursday night, before the Canada Day long weekend. in a group of 5 it was half full, and the ambiance was very nice. looking around the decorations and structure, this is definitely a good date location for people to go to. The server had come up to us to give us menus, and generally the service was the highlight of the place. the waitress was polite, and explained every question with patience.   the part that failed them was the wait time for the food. some of their special items had run out, but at 10pm or so, right before long weekend that is to be expected. However when we did order the deserts. it took about 20 minutes for each desert to arrive separately. which made it basically an hour before we got to the waffle The good thing is we are all sharing the desert as a group.  otherwise the wait time was so long that we would literally be waiting for each person to take their turns eating desert. since it arrived almost like a banquet course by course timing. The desert itself was good, the strawberry shaved ice, the good part was the shaved ice portion, which was very soft and snow flakes like. This created a texture that works better with the fruits and condense milk.   The mango was also pretty good, however the strawberry was better balance in the desert. and the waffle had a good presentation value.   the only thing about the waffle is that its definitely not what they show you on the menu, on the menu they advertise the oreo waffle as a waffle infused with oreo and chocolate flavour, with vanilla ice cream on it. However the truth is it is basically a regular waffle, with oreo pieces and chocolate ice cream. literally the opposite.   the star they lost was due to extremely long wait time for the deserts, and also the waffles false advertisement.   overall service and environment is nice, and the food was decent, so its worth a try, but probably not on a day right before a weekend perhaps."}
{"text":"The place is nice for a intimate date.The fruit is not very fresh here so I would not recommend fruity binsu like the mango one. There was always one waitress/waiter when ever I visited so the service was pretty slow."}
{"text":"I had the Red Bean Bingsoo and the Green Apple Bingsoo. The shaved ice itself is pretty good, but it's too sweet for me personally. The ice itself is already infused with milk and sugar, so the combination with the sauces and ice cream is quite the sugar overload for me. I really like the texture of the shaved ice though, it was super fine and consistent!   The Red Bean comes with kinako mochi, red bean, and a scoop of ice cream. The red bean topping was homemade and it wasn't very sweet, the texture was rough dough-like but I thought it was okay overall. I think the texture could be improved though. The Green Apple looked nothing like the pictures, there are whole grapes sprinkled on top drizzled with green apple syrup and jelly. It was way too sweet with the ice cream and the syrups and presentation wasn't very appetizing, it looked really artificial which I personally don't like. It was pretty fruity and nice at first but it becomes overwhelming.   Overall, they make good bingsoo but I think it's a little too sweet, even though I have a major sweet tooth. It's a nice place to hang out and eat desserts, but it's actually pretty expensive at $9 and above."}
{"text":"I'm more than disappointed with today's visit here. I came here for convenience's sake, and because the bingsoo here used to be quite good. I've always tolerated the ambiance, but today just didn't cut it. We came about 3:30-4:00pm today. There weren't many people. We were seated in the middle towards the back somewhere. Their tables have always been awkwardly small for four people, but they didn't have other patrons sitting next to us, so we moved the table next to us over as well. The light fixtures are about chest height to me when I'm standing up, so maneuvering in and out from the tables was quite awkward. Those things are constant irritations when I come here. Today, it was worse. For whatever reason, the restaurant smelled sorta like washrooms today, and not in a good way. Not what I'm expecting when I want dessert. That's for sure.  We ordered the injeolmi bingsoo and added green tea ice cream. Is it just me or did the bowls get smaller? Today, the ice wasn't as fluffy. In fact, there were some clumps stuck together. It didn't melt instantly in my mouth. I had to chew on the ice. I can't remember the last time I had to do that with bingsoo. Their injeolmi didn't taste fresh either. There were some pieces with hard edges. I can't remember if they used to layer their bean powder between layers of ice, but they certainly didn't today. There was nothing left but ice after we ate that top layer.   We also ordered the fruit waffle. The pictures have a sparkler. I got a sparkler on my waffle the last time I was here (in April). We did not get a sparkler today. That was quite a bit of a letdown. The waffle was presented quite beautifully regardless, but still, no sparkler. It was tasty, but nothing particularly special. At $11.99, I've had better.  For a place that I thought specialized in bingsoo, today was quite the letdown. It was my friends' first time at Cafe Bene and they said the bingpoo at the Poop Cafe is better than this one. Sad times.  Side note: They don't have the promotion where you post on IG and get 10% off your meal anymore."}
{"text":"Cozy and nice Cafe:3! It's located on the second floor of the building. Price is reasonable- approximately $12 for 3 people for shaved ice? Would definitely recommend everyone to come and try it out!"}
{"text":"Cafe bene is a warm and cozy place which makes it an absolutely great place to chill with friends and family. Just don't expect much in the way of food.  Ambience was great, tons of wood on the walls featuring a rustic look and warm lighting all contributed to an enjoyable sit-down experience. There are two big screens showing k-pop. This is a Korean cafe after all!   We got the green tea bingsu which wasn't bad. It was actually my first time trying bingsu (I feel Taiwanese shaved ice is better). The shaved ice had tons of toppings such as corn flakes, strawberries, bananas, tapioca, and beans. Once all the toppings were eaten, there was a lot of ice left. The chocolate oreo waffle was definitely over-cooked, as it was brittle (the waitress did tell us it was though). The sparkler was a pleasant surprise though! Again topped with similar to ingredients. It is important to note the two items weren't overly sweet which was nice.  Also had a chamomile tea which was your standard tea. They had these super cute coffee cup holders with their branding."}
{"text":"Service is good, the shaved ice is the best dessert there!!! It's price is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe situated upstairs. Some of the desserts were okay, good seating and lighting."}
{"text":"The green tea oreo bingsu had a base of ice topped w/ oreo bits, sliced almond, whipped cream, green tea ice-cream, and a waffle biscuit. The portion was good for two people, but it could've used more toppings. As well, the shaved ice was not fluffy enough (almost slushy) and the taste was okay- I've had better. It's still a cute place to hang out w/ friends though."}
{"text":"Cafe Bene is probably my cousin's favorite place to study or chill. When I really miss Korean desserts or just the environment of a Korean cafe, Cafe Bene is the place to go. I always go to New York/Toronto  with my family and I stop by Cafe Bene. This is such a cute and spacious place to catch up with your friends or have a hard-core study session. What I usually get is the shaved ice dessert. For those who don't know what it is... it is probably the BEST thing you will ever taste. It condensed shaved ice milk and usually with red bean and ice cream. Now there are many different types and topics. I usually like the green tea one. Yes...that is all I have to say other than it is very aesthetic and big major Korean memories.   GO to Cafe Bene :)"}
{"text":"Along Yonge Street, just south of Finch, this place can be tough to locate with all the bright signs and restaurant, bars and grocery stores that are around it.  However if you're lucky to stumble upon this place, its truly quaint once you go up the stairs (that I almost tripped on).  The ambiance is Cute, warm, wood all over.  It almost feels like you're in a restaurant situated in the middle of a park or forest.  No doubt a great place to bring friends and chill out.  If you're into Korean Pop music they've got two big televisions to keep you eyes occupied whilst waiting for your meal.   Since us two were only here for dessert Jen suggested we try their Chocolate chip and green tea saved ice.  Once this beautifully presented dish arrived, I was speechless.Out of all the shaved ice places I've been to thus far, this was the best.  Its not surprise this hidden gem is doing so well.    Definitely a great place to go, if you can find it. Parking can be limited in this area since its among so many restaurants and grocery stores."}
{"text":"Warning: Every person at the table has to order one item, or you will be charged $3 per person who doesn't order. It says at the bottom of every page on their menu.  I think we expected too much when we came here.   The only good thing we got was the thing we came for: Mango Bingsu, which was pretty darn good. It had lots of fruit, mango jelly, and the super creamy ice cream on top really pulled everything together. Super refreshing, really enjoyable. If I were to come back, I'd just get this. If we just had this one dish, I'd give this place 4/5.  Everything else we got was not that great.   Oreo waffle: It's pretty hard to screw this up. It was okay. I didn't really get the Oreo taste or vibe from it though. It was just a waffle with fruits, a scoop of chocolate ice cream, stale pizzelle, whipped cream, covered in chocolate syrup with ground up oreo pieces sprinkled on top of it. They should rename it the chocolate waffle.  Green Tea Latte: Nothing special, really. It's maybe one step up from a green tea latte from Starbucks, and that's not saying much. At least they don't charge extra if you want to order it iced.  Sweet Potato Almond Slush or whatever: I don't know what I was expecting. It looks good in the picture, but don't get this. It's very bland, there are chunks of ice in it, mixed with large un-pulverized pieces of almond. Every sip I took required me chomping pieces of ice and half soggy almonds. SO BLAND. SUCH BAD TEXTURES. I ended up adding lots of sugar to it and I still couldn't finish it. Had to throw it out. And it was $7 + tax and tip? Yeah right. Don't get this.   Oh and the kicker, they over-charged us for an extra gross slushy. I asked for a breakdown of the bill because I thought it was weird that everything put together cost so much, but they were unable to give it to me. So after we paid and walked out the door, the guy came out and told us that they made a mistake and gave us the money back for what they overcharged us for, but dude. Come on. That shouldn't happen in the first place. From what a separate reviewer has said, this place has been around for a couple of years already, it's time to get professional."}
{"text":"Came after dinner with a friend. We were pretty full but decided we could go for a shared dessert. There was only a four-person table available so we had extra seat-space.   We ordered the mango shaved ice, which is one of their specialities. Topped with pieces of mango, jelly and vanilla ice cream, this treat is good to share between 2-3 people. The shaved (milk) ice was sweet and tasty. The mango pieces seemed to be frozen and tastes sour if you eat the shaved ice first. A nice dessert to share, but make sure to request for water ahead of time. We asked for 2 cups of water but it was forgotten. When we asked again, we were given a small styrofoam cup to share.  Final thoughts: Cute Korean desserts joint. Unless you're hungry, the shaved ice are better to share. Relaxed and young atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came to this place multiple times. I love this place the environment is amazing the seating is great. The way the service working is unique the lady will come give you the menu with a bell when you ready to order to use the bell to call her. I ordered caramel makato which was good. What I really love about this place is the environment so if you want to come here with friends or a girl this place will be your good choice as it is nice and organized. They got the red light above each table I guess we will know what the lights are for.  Regards, K"}
{"text":"I believe its the only place you can get milk shaving in Toronto. Its really nice with cozy atmosphere. I haven't tried other desserts but their milk shaving is the best!"}
{"text":"Very wood like interior- pretty nice. However Small is limited and you might feel a bit claustrophobic in some of the tables- not a lot of space. Seats are limited as it is a popular place, expect to wait for a bit before getting a table. Service is alright   There's free wifi - however it can get pretty loud would not recommend studying here. Come here for group gathering.  Desserts are okay can't really go wrong lol"}
{"text":"I don't usually go to dessert places but this cafe is definitely worth another visit. Their menu is relatively large and even has pictures which I found very helpful and tempting.   I tried the strawberry and peach bingsu and these were simply delicious. They looked really nice and the shaved iced had a nice sweet flavour. I also had their green tea latte which was quite a disappointment.  The latte tasted alright but there was no effort put in to make it look pretty.  As for atmosphere, there isn't much space for a large group so if you do visit, come with a group of 4 or less. Also, you get a discount if you post a picture of their bingsu on fb or instagram which is always a plus."}
{"text":"First time trying after passing by this place so many times. Cafe Bene is pretty popular in Korea and I thought I would give this place a try.   It's located upstairs and its barely visible unless you know exactly where it is. It appears small but there's a good amount of seating.   The menu has a fair amount of selections including coffees, teas, combos with desserts and of course shaved ice. Honestly I felt the coffee was average and my friend and I received them in takeout cups. I wished it were in actual cups which would have made the experience more pleasant. The shaved ice however was amazing! We got the coffee flavour and its meant for sharing as well. The combination of everything was really good.   The service is like any other typical Korean cafe and she was friendly enough. I would definitely come back for more shaved ice!"}
{"text":"Perfect for students hanging out or studying at the cafe with large group tables and smaller singular ones. We were placed in a corner table facing two walls with very minimal leg and table room which was disappointing. Also, the wifi was not working for us although we mentioned it to the staff 3x and all they told us was to restart our computers (although the wifi didn't even work on our phones either).  We ordered the affogatto which was mediocre and green tea bubble tea. Oddly they didn't have just regular iced tea (no milk) options.   As long as you don't mind the noise, I would come back for the study space as long as they fix their wifi, and possibly try their food options (although based of previous reviews, are not that appetizing)."}
{"text":"Had a business meeting here and I am quite impressed with their sweets! Cute place, clean although the service was slow. But worth the wait for my coffee and waffles. Not perfect for business meetings as they get a bit noisy during lunch hour so they were busy but I will definetely come back."}
{"text":"Pretty cozy cafe with your standard cafe fixes - we ordered the green tea and red bean waffle, and cheesecake. The waffle was quite good, pretty good portion size, and generous amount of ice cream. I liked that it came with a sparkler! The cheesecake was ok, wasn't too sweet and just tasted like your standard cheesecake. We also got the iced hazelnut coffee which I found way too sweet."}
{"text":"Cafe Bene @ North York is a cute cafe and I recommend as a good date place. Coming back from South Korea, I was really craving Honey Butter Bread, but I should've known better to expect the same quality of the brick bread. It wasn't anything to be desired...my craving is still there."}
{"text":"Located on the second floor, Nice atmosphere, there's free wifi.   Dessert was pretty good  Their Korean shaved ice was sweet but not too sweet. We ordered strawberry, there was a great amount of strawberries given. The strawberries were  really fresh!!  Should definitely try"}
{"text":"Such a cuteeeeee cafe that makes me feel right at home! Love the wooden decor, plants placement and booth seats where friends can just chat and catch up and forget about the time. This place reallllly has a \"homey\" vibe... To put that into perspective for you, The table next to us were actually painting their nails! I know right! Lol. I'm actually kind of glad that sweet o clock next door didn't have the green tea shaved ice available (because the girl that knows how to make it is on vacation... Wtf?) so I was able to discover this place. We ordered the rice cake shaved ice and green tea Oreo shaved ice. Both were really tasty and not overly sweet. HOWEVER, the ice was not fluffy and snowy enough. They were chunky and I actually felt like I was eating chunks of ice... Not good :( When you are near the end of the dessert, there's not much flavour to it left! Wish they could've drenched the ice in condensed milk or something! I mean, I know I'm eating an ice dessert but I actually don't like the feeling of eating crunchy ice! Having said that, I would still come back to try their other Korean style desserts."}
{"text":"Small hidden place, for girls mostly. Tried the waffles, which were served with a sparkler! Bonus!   Great place for a bunch of girlfriends to hang around."}
{"text":"A small a cozy joint to go on a Sunday night. Snowflake ice cream, it's their signature dish. A must-try. It could be a little too sweet for some folks, but it has a quite unique taste. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This a cute little cafe tucked on the second floor near the yonge and finch area.  I haven't really been in the hype with shaved ice so i don't have much to compare this to except cha me cha's crappy one.  Anyway we ordered the rice cake bingsoo and a caramel cheesecake.  The rice cake bingsoo was so creamy,light,fluffy and refreshing. It wasn't too sweet and suited our taste. The cheesecake was quite decadent and paired well with the bingsoo. I would recommend it for those with a sweet tooth!!  The service was attentive even though the place was busy. The atmosphere is also really relaxing but not a great place to bring more than a group of 4. The cafe is pretty small!  I'll be back to try the other bingsoo!!"}
{"text":"No no I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are plenty of korean dessert cafes with better tasting menus. Their bubble tea or other drink menus taste like poorly made home made style, bingsoo menus are loaded with junky toppings(syrups, bad quality whipped cream, cereal?!!)  And their bar smells like rotted milk..... So... Ya. I would not recommend this place if anyone is looking for a korean dessert in yonge and finch area."}
{"text":"Oreo green tea tastes ok. Iced latte was terrible. It wasn't even cold and had no flavour. Might try the waffles next time though and I hope it's better than what I had today..."}
{"text":"Looking for a cute place to take your date? Cafe Bene is the place. Also decent for small groups. It is located on the top floor of a restaurant space on Yonge and Finch. Interior is divided into small sub-rooms that seat anywhere from 1-3 tables. The wooden interior adorable to say the least.  However... the food...  Ordered a regular milk tea, cheese corn, oreo bingsu, injeolmi bingsu, and strawberry bingsu.  Bingsu - all had great toppings and plated nicely. Would have been great except for the milk shaved ice itself. Theirs is dense and clumpy... milk shaved ice should be much more fluffy and airy. Obviously theres more water content in their milk shaved ice than other bingsu joints like Cups or Snowtime. 2.5/5  Cheese corn - yum. Good to share and very simple. Easy to recreate at home. Not mind blowing though, just something to order off the menu if you're feeling for something warm instead. 3/5  Bubble tea - among the worst I've tried, especially shameful because there's so many popular bubble tea places available nearby. 1/5  We sat-in during a full house around 11 PM and were minimally serviced. When we were serviced, our server was speedy. Just had to ask for water twice since he forgot about us the first time.  Didn't have a really negative experience but won't be back."}
{"text":"Came on a friday night. Pretty late so there wasnt a lot people and i was able to park right outside. Its located on the second floor, if my girl didnt know the area well, i would never found it lol  Ordered the infamous shaved ice. And woohoooo, way better than i expected. Its so fluffy and good. Not too sweet, the mochi were soft and chewy. We were originally gna share one. But it was so good we got another one lol   As for the service, could barely find anyone to take my order. Tried waving down someone a couple times. Very limited menu, i was kind hungry and wanted to get something savoury to start with. But cuz there wasnt much of a choice, i end up only getting the shave ice. There were so many empty tables but they sat these two girls in our booth, so i could hear their conversation the whole time. Thats where they lost starts. Otherwise, pretty impressed with their shaved ice."}
{"text":"It's quite a hidden place. This Korean cafe locates at the second floor of the building. It's bigger than expected. Their snowflake ice cream is good, must try. But don't go there after a full meal as their desserts are sizeable."}
{"text":"This place has definitely improved over the years. The first time I came here was about 6 years ago. During that time, most of the staff only spoke Korean, and the desserts were not very good. The last couple of times I have come back have been a lot better. They upgraded their menu items and their new bingsoos are pretty decent. I wish they would use fresh Mangoes for their Mango bingsoo, but it's still good. I like the middle layers of injeolmi powder, giving it a bit more depth and nuttiness when you get to the middle parts of the bingsoo. Other than that, I usually oder a hot apple cider, which comes with a cinnamon stick. I have also tried their waffles and the pasta as well. When you're REALLY hungry, the pasta is not bad. The noodles are overcooked and the sauce is subpar, but it satisfies the hunger when you are studying. The decor is nice and bright, and it's split into individual booths (sometimes shared), which makes it a pretty good place to study in my opinion.  It can get a little loud with the music and people talking, but it's actually not that bad. It's a good place to go after a meal, to catch up with friends, or even to have a casual date. It's not the best cafe in Toronto, and I have been the Cafe Bene in both LA and Seoul, but it's homey.  Menu items are standard in terms of price, but the food items can be a little expensive. Service is friendly, and most of them speak English quite well."}
{"text":"I love this cute little place. Its private, fun, nicely decorated and I enjoy their deserts late at night. Definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"I don't go here anymore because their bingsu has gotten poorly bad. It didn't have a variety of toppings, like corn flake, etc. anymore. The bingsu now is just shaved ice with whatever topping flavor. It's used to my favorite bingsu place but now it's in my blacklist."}
{"text":"Pretty hidden place. It's right across from Chatime, second floor with the black windows.  Absolutely LOVE this cafe! They have booths that are arranged in a manner that offers you a bit more privacy than other cafes. The lighting is dim and when paired with the booths it generates an intimate environment. They also have a room that accomodates larger groups; equipped with a big screen tv and a DVD player for those who wanna watch movies or play video games. They equip you with the basics but not the essentials so you'd have to bring your own movies if you wanna watch something and game console and games if you wanna have a video game jam. Most importantly, they have a service button! However, the button does not remain for long...once you've placed your order the button is out of reach... ): Well, at least it makes ordering a lot easier than waving frantically at a server to get their attention!  I'm not much of a fan of shaved ice but woah, their dessert blew my mind! I ordered the Grapefruit Shaved Ice shared between my friend and a Cappucinno on the side while my friend ordered the Multigrain Tea.  The Grapefruit Shaved Ice was a mountain of shaved ice laced with condensed milk amd grapefruit juice, toppled with pieces of grapefruit, banana, strawberry and conflakes and finally, a scoop of mango ice cream to top it off! It hit the spot! The Cappucinno was nothing special (maybe because I'm not a coffee drinker...). I tried my friend's Multigrain Tea and it was delicious! It reminded me of those chinese cereal packets you get from T&T. Definitely going for that next time! Oh btw, these dessert are massive so its best that you share! (Sharing is caring anyway, haha). Unless... you're that person who has a really big sweet tooth..  I totally recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Bene is hidden...really hidden...on a 2nd floor of a Bar and Grill.. and it is kind of enclosed hiding from the view of passerby...   Some yelper sent me here....... The sole Korean lady working there was really surprise to see us waltzed into her cafe, as every single patrons here were really young Korean girls and we are either Korean or young   The cafe is really small!! Some of the tables are facing the wall... and you are really going to sit drinking your coffee facing the wall??   They have Latte drinks for around $3.99... combo with Americano and waffles ($9.99) or   Green Tea Latte and Gingerbread Latte with Chocolate Cake ($10.99)  - Green Tea Latte was just way way to thick and sickening sweet SKIP!  - Gingerbread Latte was A-OK...  - Chocolate cake is store brought but really airy, bouncy and have good texture..A-OK   There are 3 private rooms at the back where you can rent a Korean DVD movies and watch with your friends or alone or with your bf/gf (I guess you can do whatever in there because you will have privacy!)   And for some that wants to do Korean girl watching.. you will be the only male that be drinking coffee from a pink flowery cup in there."}
{"text":"Cafe Bene is located on the second floor of a building. My friend and I came on a Wednesday night around 8:30pm after eating dinner. The environment was nice. It was not too big and quite cozy. Perfect place to catch up with a friend or do some work! They had the perfect chill Korean playlist as background music since this is a Korean place. As for food, I ordered the rice cake bingsoo and a white hot chocolate and my friend also ordered a sweet potato latte. Since Korean shaved ice is different from Taiwanese shaved ice, the toppings creates the entire flavour for the shaved ice. I was a bit iffy on the rice cake bingsoo but my friend wanted to try it so we ordered it and I was quite surprised. I really enjoyed it. The toppings included rice cakes, red bean and cornflakes. Although after you're done eating all the toppings, there is still quite a bit of ice left. The white hot chocolate also tasted really good. It wasn't too sweet. Overall, I would visit this place again to try their other bingsoo flavours (there were so many!) and also some of their other foods/drinks."}
{"text":"This place is hidden on the second floor of a building and it looks kind of like a hole in the wall kind of place from the outside. The inside is warm and cozy. There's free wi-fi and it's plenty fast. My American and cheesecake were decent. Nothing special though and the slice was a bit small. They don't have many cheaper options for food on the menu like a croissant or not that I could find anyway. It was pretty empty but the few tables that were there were pretty loud. Service was okay."}
{"text":"The sweet potato latte is very creamy and tastes like smashed sweet potato. Besides, I also like their spaghetti and various bingsoos."}
{"text":"Perfect treat shared amongst friends after a hearty meal. I love everything mango, so this is my automatic go-to menu item. They also offer other flavours such as Oreo-Coco and Rice Cake, and a variety of other delicious Korean desserts. The space itself is quite intimate with a minimalistic interior design. If you're looking for a fun date night spot, this place is worth checking out."}
