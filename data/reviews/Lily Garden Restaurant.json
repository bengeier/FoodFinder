{"text":"Definite hole-in-the-wall, but it's $10 for the buffet, and the food is pretty reasonable so it's fine by me. The place is definitely very dated and run-down, with very minimal service, but the food is actually quite good and the price is even better. For a student budget, it's a great place"}
{"text":"Bottom of the barrel Chinese buffet. The decor is faded and warn and the entire place needed to be hosed down. Avoid."}
{"text":"Went for a lunch buffet, price is good by toronto standards..and the number of different items was good. But the food was not so great..The meat kinda tasted hard, rubbery. Not Fresh. Egg roll seemed soggy.. The noodles was good... Overall food was ok for the price so Im giving it one extra star...  The best food they had was the Ice-cream - strawberry and chocolate, one of the better ice cream I've had in a asian buffet place."}
{"text":"I went for the buffet with my immediate and extended family, and half the food was missing. I could tell they don't get customers often because they were surprised when we came in. The tables are for some odd reason, lined with white garbage bags. The pitcher that held the water was once clear, but turned yellow. You can best bet I didn't drink out of that thing. I have a video up on youtube if anyone interested to see what this restaurant looks like. When we returned home, half my family got sick."}
{"text":"It's not great by any means but  if you want something cheap close by then yea give it a go ... If your looking for something fancy go somewhere else but if u want Chinese food and all u can eat then sure go here...the shrimp is good but the lemon chicken is kinda funky"}
{"text":"Mother thought we should check this place out, to give a place a chance without looking up reviews.  The place can seat a good number of people. The decor is very old and faded; paint peels and flakes off the walls and chairs, the floor is stained, and the place seems a few years away from being abandoned. They may not have the money or motivation to change this, and that's cool. There are places with great food but a less than great appearance.    The menu is pretty standard for what it is.  Prices are pretty affordable.  We ordered mushroom egg foo young, spring rolls, spicy eggplant in black bean sauce sauce with tofu, mixed vegetables, vegetable lo mein, vegetable fried rice, and mushroom egg drop soup. All the food was very underwhelming and flavourless. Sauces were very thin, the spicy dish had no flavour, much less heat, and the lo mein was some type of ramen noodle with, again, zero flavour. The vegetables were cooked alright. The eggplant was done not in a *bad* way, though as I said, no flavour. The mixed vegetable dish had bak choi, celery, onions, green beans, and broccoli. The bak choi was cooked nicely but the other things...eh...not so much. The egg drop soup was very watery. Their peas and carrots were the standard from-frozen type and the mushrooms were the button mushrooms. They did not add anything to the soup. I didn't try the other dish but my siblings and mother said it wasn't very good.  The rice also had a strange quality to it and was very offputting.  I think this place is owned by husband and wife. The husband seems very nice. They have a bar too. They cater and do delivery too, and have a lunch buffet that kinda languishes in the center room. It has veerrryy few vegetarian options, from what I saw walking past it.  I wouldn't come back here, neither would I reccomend it."}
{"text":"Small, simple, basic, cheap.  If that's what you're looking for, come on down.  Choices are limited and quality is about average but there's nothing really wrong with the place.  If you want all-you-can-eat and have less than $15, give it a try."}
