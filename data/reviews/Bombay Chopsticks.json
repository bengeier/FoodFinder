{"text":"Awesome service and awesome food! Nice atmosphere for a small restaurant. Very clean. Fresh cotton table cloths (no paper covering them like many restaurants which kind of defeats the purpose of a table cloth). Try the crispy Bombay chicken. It's sweet and crunchy and probably unhealthy but it will have you coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and excellent service. Must try chicken hot and sour soup, chicken chow main."}
{"text":"Bombay Chopsticks is a regular go to place for my wife and I. It's a very home-y place that serves hot and tasty food very quickly. As regulars, the staff has grown to know us. They're quite friendly and very efficient. We always order the Crispy Beef and one of the fried rice. You simply cannot go wrong here. The wife orders the Hot and Sour Soup almost every time we visit. She swears by it. Other items we order are the Eggplant with Manchurian Sauce with the sauce on the side. (We do this so that if we have to take it home, the fried eggplant doesn't go mushy.) I won't go into describing each item. In general, I just have to say that the food seems home cooked - which is a very good thing for me. Okay, if you're home has a high temperature wok :-)  The menu has a lot of items. However, if you take a look carefully, a lot of it is just a mix and match of the meats/veggies and sauce/cooking style. Whether this is good or bad depends on you. For me, it just makes selection much simpler. For example, I like the fried eggplant with the Manchurian Sauce. Maybe next time I'll try it with another sauce.  The place itself is very clean. The decor is lightly South Asian with subdued lighting. It's a good place for a quiet dinner with a date or some friends and family."}
{"text":"Nice hakka resto -  leans more towards the Chinese side of hakka.  A few really good veggie dishes. I usually get the panner dishes.  Service has always been good, nice waiters, ok priced."}
{"text":"Stay away:  1) They claimed to be Halal certified for meat and chicken. Showed a certificate dated 2009 from ISNA. I contacted ISNA and they confirmed my suspicions. We were lied to. When a business owner lies about certification... How can I trust them in any thing else.   2) Food is bland. Nothing special. We ordered the Fish and Garlic, Shrimp and Garlic and Pasta Shrimp."}
{"text":"I frequent this spot for business lunches fairly often, it's a great spot for that purpose as it's not uber high end (meaning the price is definitely right) and it's not a hole in a wall kind of restaurant. The service is extremely friendly and the food is prompt. They have great lunch specials that come with a soup and entree for just $7.99."}
{"text":"Horrible food, I cannot believe all the good reviews!  Food bland and watery. Hot and sour soup taste like dirty sewer water.  Chilli chicken taste like a chewy sponge.  I have been to several hakka place this is by far the worse thing ive ever ate!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. I've since moved to California but love coming here when I'm back to visit the folks. Roger who has been here for ages is always friendly along with the other staff. The food here is good, clean and flavorful."}
{"text":"Poor quality food. Tasteless and bland. And they ask for more tip?? You gotta be kidding me. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"On  the Thai menu, Pat- thai with chicken and shrimp is a choice that i dont regret making and might consider trying it again. Other main courses to choose when were eating here with a group of family members or friends are lemon chicken and hakka noodles, crispy beef, egg fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, hot and sour soup. Its licensed halal meat and the best Chinese fusion in Mississauga. The environment is clean and has some nice touches like the buddha fountain and liquor bar. The service is really good and feels upscale when your dining with your group. I gave it 3/5 for the halal menu and high quality service."}
{"text":"Horrible food.. Doesn't even taste like Hakka, I took them 5 mintiues to make my order.. How's that even possible? . Every one eating at the restaurant looked misrable. The food is burned . Chilli chicken is so sweet.. Horrible food Boby listen to these reviews save your money.  Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I have gone to the Rexdale location and absolutely love their food! This is definitely one of the best Hakka Chinese places I've been to. My favourite dish here is the Bombay chicken -- I highly recommend this place for good food at a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"Good, but not extraordinary. I would definitely visit again.  Good ambiance, friendly staff, and the food was tasty, but not quite as Indo-chinese as i expected it to be."}
{"text":"Just left after a wonderful dinner.  The food was excellent and when we added some of the chili paste that was on the table it was amazing!  Part of what made it so special was that both of the staff that were working were incredibly attentive, kind and friendly.  The gentleman who served us made great recommendations and the lady who assisted matched h smile for smile.   That's what going out for dinner is all about :-)"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place.  The food is still good but I do not frequent it as often as I once did.  Perhaps there are more competitive options nowadays or maybe I just wanted a change.  Any how, the food quality and menu selection is great.  The restaurant itself is fairly small, but clean and relatively quiet.  I don't think I have ever tried anything that was not good at this place.  If you have not been there, check it out.  Its worth a taste!"}
{"text":"Its a nice cozy restaurant which has some decent hakkah Chinese fusion food! There lunch specials are good and have tummy filling portions.   The food itself tastes good and is warm and comes in a timely fashion.  The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and fast. Plus they do individual bills as well.  The parking is not a problem as its part of a big plaza."}
{"text":"Ok so When I go to Toronto for work this is one one of the must go places on my list every visit! I had 2 very very picky eaters with me and they couldn't stop raving about the place. The time I went was always as good as the first time.   I am not sure if they are the owners but there are always these 2 semi elderly people there and they are so nice! I am a veggie and I can always find something wonderful there to eat.   The portions are always good....I wish I could take home the leftovers but alas I am always ina hotel....The prices are very fair and the atmosphere is good as well.    Go for a stroll if you are in the Mississauga area :) and have yourself a plate or 2 of YUM"}
{"text":"Bombay Chopsticks, another fantastic location to find Hakka (Indian-Chinese) goodness. I used to work in Mississauga and this restaurant was a lunch staple. It was just too tasty too avoid.   The menu is massive so unless you're vegetarian, try to stick with what I consider the cream of the crop below. The service is usually great, yet it can become quite busy during peak times.   Hot and Sour Soup  (very strong and musky, great for colds) Chicken Corn Soup  (good, even better with a splash of soya and chili oil) Chili Chicken   (dry) (unreal) Chili Chicken  (gravy) Crispy Beef   (unreal) Manchurian Mixed Chowmein Spicy Crispy Fish    (dry)  * I'd recommend going at lunch over dinner because the difference in price is rather substantial. Check out my ideal order below and you too will become a repeat customer over dinner."}
{"text":"So we gave it another shot since they sent us a $25 gift certificate but when we asked to use it, they completely refused to acknowledge it. The same server had no idea what we were talking about and claimed complete oblivion."}
{"text":"crispy fried tofu and the noodles which I can't remember what the name were, filled me right up! it was a very fancy looking place though, i must say :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a quiet & small restaurant with great food and great service.  It's also good value for money."}
{"text":"This place is not bad, problem is it is mediocre and expensive.  Here are my two issues with it:  Bad service Mediocre taste at a premium price"}
{"text":"Was in a hurry and decided to go it one more try as we were there a long time ago.   Ordered a Hot and Sour soup - the soup does not fit the Hakka criteria for us. A bit too sour for our taste and did not do anything for us.  A Paneer Chilly was not spicy at all and had some gravy but hardly any chillies and had red dried rather than the fresh green.  A fried rice which was ok A Hakka Noodle, had equal amount of cabbage and noodles and were hard to distinguish between noodles and cabbage. This was the best dish amongst all A spicy mixed vegetables was again vegetables in a gravy.   The quantity was way less than compared to other restaurants and priced in the high end. The service was a 5/5, but the food was 2/5  Would really have to convince me to come back"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant, easily accessible if you live/work anywhere in the area.  Went here for lunch today,  I've tried other Hakka restaurants in the area and so I have an idea of what I like now and what I don't.  This place is good and I will return to try other items. White linnen table cloths, real napkins on the table makes this resto feel like you're eating a pretty nice place.   Ordered from the lunch menu, which is $7.99. Great price.  You get: - Choice of soup or one spring roll (there are 3 diff kinds of soup) - Choice of meat/fish - Choice of veg fried rice or veg noodle  My bf and I both had the hot and sour soup. Delicious, murky and hot and sour ;). A nice start to the meal.  Second we ordered one chili chicken and one chili beef (both dry), both with veg noodles.  The chicken was the best. It was perfectly spiced, not too salty (which I find a lot of hakka places can over salt dishes), and didn't have a crazy batter on it. It was lightly dusted, fried and sauced.  I think they could have done a little more with the noodles, spice-wise but I guess with the chili sauce from the meat it's okay to have something a little less spiced as the meat carries it.   The beef was good too but I liked the texture of the chicken and would absolutely order it again.  Service was great, attentive and water glasses were always filled.  Server suggested the chili fish next time, which I'll def get. Can't remember if it was on the lunch menu or not though.   I'll be back.  It was a great price at $18.08 before tip for lunch for two and we were in/out in 40 minutes."}
{"text":"I dropped by here on one of my \"work from home\" days because I didn't feel like Naan and Kabob.    I had the lunch special (your choice of entrée) which was $7.99 and came with choice of rice or noodles and soup or spring roll.  I decided on the noodles and soup (corn) and decided on the chili fish as my entrée.    Nothing was overly greasy or overly salty, which is great because I find Hakka places sometimes overdo it. Also, I asked for the fish medium spicy and it didn't kill my sinuses, so that's always a bonus.  With regards to decor, it's not bad. Nothing super fancy, but nothing to be ashamed at either.   Verdict: Great lunch place."}
{"text":"Offers one of the best hakka food in the neighbourhood. The chilli chicken is their best item on the menu. The restaurant is worth visiting for the lunch special."}
{"text":"Ugh, do not go here.   Apparently, this place used to be amazing.   Used to.  The food we ordered was flavourless, watery and not greasy at all. The portions were tiny.  The restuarant was empty as hell, at 7 on a saturday.   We had :  Chili Chicken - barely any spice. Watery. The gravy was beige. CHILI CHICKEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE BLACK OR DARK BROWN. WTF.  Bombay Chicken (starter) - Deep fried chicken with mad breading, and doused in a sweet sauce. My friend said it tasted like Jalebi. eww.  Fried Rice - passable.  Beef Chow Mein - not at all what I expected. A cripy basket of noodles with beef + veg on top.   Ugh, go to Eddie's instead please."}
{"text":"One of the better indo chinese (hakka) place in Mississauga area (although I'd still rather trek over to Airport/Derry) They have the chilli chicken, crispy beef/chicken, canto chowmein and hot and sour soup. they are priced similar to other places 9.99 a dish or more.   Really great service :D"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Priced like a regular restaurant, but the food was anything but memorable. One thing I can compliment is the decor, as it has a very homey feel, however service and quality of food take away from that."}
{"text":"Great hakka food! Not only was the food delicious, but the owners were extremely kind and made sure everything was perfect to our liking. To me, customer service goes a long way and bombay chopsticks delivered."}
{"text":"Crispy beef, Crispy chicken, Crispy fish and tofu was amazing, love the hakka food here.  The staff is very friendly as well. Lunch menu is a bit expensive for the amount that you get though..."}
{"text":"great hakka chinese in Mississauga (hurontario and bristol)"}
{"text":"Try the spicy crispy squid!! My favourite Hakka place in Mississauga, I've been coming here for years. And what's best is the service, they're all so sweet and friendly that you can't help but come back again :)"}
{"text":"I think the other reviews quite adequately sum up Bombay Chopsticks. It's a nice little restaurant that offers Indian-Chinese food. It's a little hard for me to tell where the fusion of the two cuisines exists. I wouldn't mind if the menu laid it out better.   Service is quite good as reported and the owner/waiter was more than willing to allow modifications to the menu items.   I found the Panneer Biryani ho ho hot but lacking any kind of flavor. The Manchurian fish was a nice dish, as was the Chicken with Garlic Sauce.   The restaurant offers a nice, placid atmosphere and has the makings of a good first date restaurant."}
{"text":"It's all about the crispy beef.  I've tried a number of things here.  Most are pretty good, but some are below average (Their hakka noodles are terrible!  What's with the wide flat noodles?  Should be skinny thin noodles IMO.)  However the crispy beef is great in my opinion which totally makes me frequent here.  I've also tried their chili chicken (meh, dark meat.  They have a white meat version too but its not breaded) which is above average but not the best I've had.  Dragon chicken with cashew nuts isn't even close to being as good as Salt & Pepper's which is just up the road.  I'd get the crispy beef and fried rice (manchurian or szechuan) from Bombay Chopsticks and get the Crispy chili chicken and hakka noodles from Salt & Pepper.  They are very close to eachother.."}
{"text":"Can I just say WOW?? OMFG why can't I find anyone as good as you in the US??  I grew up in Ottawa my entire life, and frequented Toronto almost every 3 months or so. Everytime I went, I *always* made sure I ate here, and got my vegetable manchurian chowmein and paneer chili to go (my mom would KILL me if I didn't bring her any back!) Yes, ppl, its that good!  After relocating to the US 3 years ago, I've been back in Toronto about 4 times now. Most recently, just this past sunday, and wow!! The food hasn't changed one bit! Same great quality, same great taste, and the owner always gives you impeccable service. Of course, as I got my takeout dishes to take home to my Mommy, and the owner even hooked us up with a shortcut route! Need I say more?  He makes me miss home even more I wish I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"They caused me major diarrhea like ww2 type of bombs. Their chopsticks are shorter than my pinky fingers. The chicken tastes like they put straight up shit in it. 10/10 would not recommend unless you want dog shit."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past 5 years. My absolute favourite hakka place. They make the best crispy beef and chilli chicken. Friendly staff. Small and classy ambiance."}
{"text":"Service is good but food is very mediocre.  Lack of flavor and pricey compared to other hakka restaurants in mississauga. We had chicken corn soup (bland) machurian noodles (over cooked and very bland), dry chilli chicken (good) and chilli paneer (watery and not spicy at all). Disappointed that we paid $14 per dish that was very bland."}
{"text":"The best thing on the menu is the crispy beef! Get an order of the Thai style veggie rice, amazing combo! The Green curry isn't as rich with ingredients as most authentic thai restaurants. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I had the chicken corn soup and sweet and sour chicken balls. Both of the dishes were pretty good, though nothing special.  There is a parking lot you can park in.  Would recommend this place, thought the service can be slightly better."}
{"text":"Detroit needs an Indian-Chinese fusion place as good as this one.  I had lunch here a few months back and intended to finish this review sooner.  I really enjoyed the Chili Chicken Biryani and the HOT and Sour Soup.  My daughter opted for \"General George(Tsos)\"  Chicken and some Spring Rolls.    Portions were huge, the prices low, and the service was excellent!"}
