{"text":"Pizza and wings were excellent.  Thin crust and the wings were perfectly crispy.  Only downside is limited parking but that doesn't affect the great food.  Makes Rosatis look like garbage.  The price is right, too!  This is our go-to pizza place now.  The owner is super friendly and the service was great."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Chicago style pizza, Italian sausage sandwich, cheese bread and other goodies this is the place to go.  It's a small family owned restaurant and they treat you like family.  I ordered all of the above and I was in heaven.  This is the kind of food where you may need to loosen a button or zipper on your jeans.  I'm looking forward to trying other things on the menu.  I totally need a nap now. Lol, Laura"}
{"text":"Haven't had pizza here yet, but the All Star sandwich is delicious, especially if you add sweet peppers. Good amount of Mozzarella; right amount of juiciness -- not so much that the bread is falling apart and not so little that the sandwich is dry. Cheese sticks are served hot like they should be. (A lot of other restaurants cannot seem to understand that cheese sticks are supposed to be served when the cheese is still gooey on the inside....) I would definitely dine here again!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best thin crust pizza I've ever had. The owner is from Chicago and comes from a pizza restaurant family in Chicago and it really shows. We ordered a small Supreme and it was more than enough for two. Great prices and a great pizza!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I can't speak highly enough about this place.  To any nay sayers, all I can say is that you clearly have never had good Chicago style thin crust pizza before.  Love - LOVE this place!  Brings back so many memories of working in a small pizza shop just like this when I was young.  Fantastic and fresh ingredients.  Perfect crust, sweet (but not too sweet) sauce and excellent Italian sausage!  And the owner was a wonderful and charming guy.  Will be back here again and again."}
{"text":"Great place ! Great test !! Stop by ... you won't regret !!! Authentic Chicago style food ..."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good chicago thin. I have it four stars due to lack of az competition for the category. Crust was nice, sauce a little sweet for me, cheese good and sausage was the highlight, like five stars for that. The guys in the restaurant were really nice. I appreciate the local business too."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is awesome, crisp and piping hot from the oven!! Next time I'm going to try the cheesy beef sandwich. The chicken wings are top notch, pizza toppings fresh, and not to mention the cheesy garlic bread is the bomb!! Try this small family owned restaurant you will love it and the friendly owners."}
{"text":"Great Combo Sandwich - the beef was great and the sausage was also very good. Generous serving of Mozzarella cheese added to this excellent sandwich. I happened to see this on Yelp and was in the area so decided to stop and check it out. You'll never regret coming here - gotta try the Pizza next time I'm around."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended on a FB website in Chandler I was so happy to finally get to try it. What a disappointment. We went in on Saturday around 5:00 there was one family ordering and one man waiting for his order. We ordered a small 12 inch 2 topping pizza.  We waited for 45 minutes and I finally said to my husband wow this is taking a long time.  The man waiting on his order said he had been waiting for 30 minutes before we got there and he had ordered a sandwich....he got his order right after that and said good luck.  The family was still waiting.  I asked the girl at the counter how much longer she went back to the kitchen and said they were boxing it.  Another girl came out and said it was not our pizza.  I asked why it was taking so long, the cook came out looking bewildered said nothing but was clearly frustrated.  The girl then said they were swamped...the phone rang once while we were there and no one else came in.  We asked for our,obey back and left...so if the food is good it's to bad because they clearly were not ready to serve their customers."}
{"text":"This is the best Chicago pizza ever!!! The owner is the best and nicest man ever. Makes you feel right at home. I've recommended this place to multiple people now and they all fall in love :) Richest, yummiest flavors and wonderful customer service!"}
{"text":"This is  my favorite Chicago pizza place in town. Cheesy beef sandwich was AMAZING!! Pizza was SPECTACULAR! Service was great. Owner was very friendly and you can see he takes pride in his business. Our family is defiantly added this location to our eating our rotation. Nothing fancy but like a East Coast business were you feel like you are at home eating good food and I am not even from Chicago! A must try!"}
{"text":"The beef in the sandwich was so tender! The pizza was nice and crispy! The fries were even super crispy! I'll definitely be back. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly! Staff being one guy haha, but he was great."}
{"text":"The guy who owns this place used to own pizza places around McHenry IL.

This is not what most people think of when they hear Chicago Pizza.

It is South Side thin crust with a sweet sauce. Not Spinato's sweet but middle sweet. 

The crust is a very very thin crispy cracker like crust that if it had north side sauce I would give it 5 stars. 

We got the Large 2 topping, 12 wings and a liter of pop special all for about $25. A pretty good value. 

The crust is as thin as Oregano's but much crisper. It's also thinner than Rosati's 

The sausage is really good also. It's done right as it's not slices or the pre cooked stuff. It's done the real deal way as pinched pieces from a bag of ground meat. 

The pepperoni is your average thin and greasy but nt the kid that crisps up around the edges and leave's lots of grease like Grimaldi's.

The wings were fairly good but we did take them to go and all wings tend to steam in the box on the way home but they still had some crisp left. 

If sweet sauce is not for you then this isn't the place. Stick to Rosati's or Buddyz. If you want pan then go to Lou's. And if you like New York Casanova Bros is for you. 

But, ff you live in or near Chandler and sweet works then I highly recommend this place. 

The owner said that the best thing on the menu is his Italian Beef. He get's the beef from Grecco Bros. Their beef is good but their juice is only OK. If he doctors up the juice it could be good though. 

He said he does a cheesy beef so I am willing to give it a try and see if it's as good as he says.

Usually adding cheese and putting the beef on garlic bread is to make up for average flavor juice. 

I'll get back to this once I've tried it."}
{"text":"A true Chicago pizzeria. Had the italian beef sandwich and...Oh My!! For all you Chicagoans living in the Valley, this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Thought I never met a slice I didn't like, but the pizza by the slice was terrible.  Cardboard covered in cheap cheese.  Probably better to order whole pie, but I don't know. The Italian beef sandwich, on the other hand, was delicious.  Wish the gardinaire wasn't 50 cents extra, but it too was delicious.  The au jus was just right, not overly garlic as many places serve it. Beef was tender and sliced thin.  Atmosphere is dive, and no beer, but staff was friendly, although not 100% accurate on order.  Was helpful to be able to park right on street out front door.  Don't come before 12:45 on schools day, however...busiest time with students from school down the road."}
{"text":"Friend and I went for a Chicago style hot dog. Great lunch price special for a dog, fries and Coke for $5.50. Owner a great guy - immediately apologized for no sport peppers but was making sure everything was right for us. Just a hole in the wall but down home friendly. Will return for pizza and Cheesy.beef. ptior to leaving, owner gave us each a Valpak coupon for our next visit. WILL RETURN."}
{"text":"Delivery is fast. Pizza is yum with it's  sweet sauce. This is thin crust pizza done right. The wings are exceptional as well. The pizza game is strong here!"}
{"text":"It was great!  I'm not from Chicago so I wouldn't really know how authentic it is, but it was good!  Had a pepperoni pizza with some added veggies, that beefy cheesy sandwich that Cy brags about  with the hot and sweet peppers and crunchy onion rings!   The owner was great!  Will be back, especially for that sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot! The thin crust pizza cut into squares was so good my family devoured a large. We also had the chicken wings and they were cooked perfectly with just the right amount if sauce. Our new favorite spot for pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"Tried this place and it was awesome!  The thin crust pizza (similar to oreganos but ten times better) was delicious, with super crunchy crust.  Only fresh ingredients used!  The wings were amazing! We got mild and they were crispy and flavorful goodness.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I LOVED the thin crust pizza!  Nice sweet sauce.  Not so much cheese that you can't taste ingredients.  Great wings and yummy cheese bread.  A small mom n pop place with a few tables.  Nicest owner you ever can meet!  He runs a daily special and has a 1/2 price pizza night!  Look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and awesome service was not disappointed, will definitely be back to try other great looking items on the menu"}
{"text":"Ordered through GrubHub and waited 90 mins for order to arrive. Never emailed or called saying they needed to cancel the order. I tried calling and they never answered the phone. Contact grubhub support and spent 20mins for them to try contacting the restaurant and to issue a refund. By this time most of the other restaurants had closed so I ended up having a bowl of cereal for dinner."}
{"text":"If you've been to Missoula Montana, it reminds me of Tower Pizza (RIP). The food is so, so good. We just went here for the first time tonight. You know it's a good sign when as you're walking in, a couple is walking out and says \"This is so good! Be sure to get the wings!\" The wings are delicious. Super crispy pizza crust and the sauce tastes fresh. The employees are very friendly. Prices are great. My husband and I will be regulars here. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this little gem in Downtown Chandler after a friend told me about it. They have great lunch specials.  2 slices and a drink for $5. I had pepperoni. The thin crust was perfect and sauce was delicious.  They also have ribs which I'll be sure to try in the near future."}
{"text":"This little hole in a wall place offers one of the best tasting wings in the area!  The menu is limited to basically mild, medium and hot which is fine with me as that's all I look forward to eating.  The sauce is buttery and tangy at the same time.  The server (teenager) was great!  It is not very often we see young kids take pride in offering great service.  The fact she made it a point to ask us if we enjoyed our dinner impressed me."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic old neighborhood Chicago Style pizza (cut in squares) this is the place! As soon as you walk in you can smell the pizza and it only gets better from there. Thin, crispy cracker crust, with just the right amount of sauce, sausage, green peppers and onion (very flavorful) topped off with an amazing cheese. Cyril (the owner) does it all right. You'll almost think you're in Chicago having pizza!!! Overall 5 Stars and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything we'd tried so far has been tasty. Pizza is thin yet crispy. The Italian beefs are the best we've had in Arizona. Service is fast and friendly. Owner remembers your name once you've been in a couple times. Wish we lived closer so they could deliver."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. This small shop has the recipe for great Chicago style food. If you haven't been, you need to go. Thanks Cy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic thin crust pizza. This is authentic thin crust Chicago style CRISPY, square cut pies... we tried the spicy Italian (owners fave) and pep with extra cheese. They were both stellar. This is all homemade by the owner himself. We didn't try the other menu items but will. Can't reccomend enough and he is a small business making with pride!"}
{"text":"I got pretty blasted and decided I wanted chicken wings late night and this place had 5 star reviews and man everyone must've eaten somewhere else because the food sucks.

I ordered 20 chicken wings and 6 cheese sticks delivery. Let's start with the cheese sticks like the cheese was barely melted like lukewarm and they didn't taste like anything. Sad.

Then we got the wings it's like they didn't season them or anything just dumped em in the fryer for 97 minutes because they were overcooked as fuck. So damn dry and the skin was hard. I got them plain because I didn't want buffalo sauce not because I wanted them to be flavorless and terrible. I couldn't even eat them. I even felt bad about giving them to my dogs, so I didn't. 

I don't know if the pizza is good here or what but everything else on the menu got gluten in it and my wife can't eat that so I guess we're just never ordering from here again. I mean I wouldn't anyway but still. If you decide to, skip the wings and cheese sticks."}
{"text":"Called and they hung up on me after I asked if they deliver to my cross roads.  Called back, guy answers frustrated.  I ask again if they deliver to my cross roads.  Guy says not until 4pm, mumbles something, then hangs up on me as I'm asking him a question.  What a jerk.  I was excited to try this place too."}
{"text":"Oh my. I found home again!  Slice of Chicago serves true \"Chicago\" style pizza. Not be confused with that deep dish stuff people think is Chicago style .  Paper thin, sweet but not too sweet sauce, high quality toppings served under the cheese. And finally square cut!!! Wow we will be back again for sure!! Thank you."}
{"text":"We are visiting here from out of town decided to give Slice of Chicsgo a try. The place was so good!! We had the pizza and wings special with  sandwiches that were off the hook. I would  Recommend this place to anyone. The owner came over and talked to us and was so nice. Even though we don't live here we will  Definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time in here and it did not disappoint. The pizza, cheezy bread stick and mozzarella stick was fantastic! I recomend this place.!"}
{"text":"Finally, good Chicago thin crust pizza.  They use the best sausage and the Grande whole milk cheese.  The owner is super nice.  It's nothing fancy.  Just a small place that knows how to make a pizza.  The sauce is sweet and yummy.  We enjoyed our cheesy garlic bread, too.  Definitely a place to try if you want a good Chicago thin pizza."}
{"text":"Loved the cheese pizza. It was challenging to figure where the place is! GPS kept taking us around the block! Wish this place was closer to QC."}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza. The owner is very friendly. If going for lunch get there before Hamilton HS breaks, they pack the small place."}
{"text":"Great place! Owner is awesome! I normally eat thick pizza and this is thin. It's really good! Great prices!"}
{"text":"This place is delicous!!!  We ordered delivery, pepperoni pizza with hot peppers and the supreme which had pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers and mushrooms.  The sauce is perfect not too sweet or salty.  We ordered chicken wings extra crispy and extra sauce. Since it was delivery they put the sauce on the side and it worked out great. I believe the owner delivered our pizza! He upgraded our small supreme to a medium just because!! Try this place out. You'll be very pleased."}
{"text":"While on vacation in Arizona,I stopped in to this pizza place.Wow!!! The thin crust pizza was amazing! I loved it! Owner was super nice & welcoming.I definitely recommend trying this place for delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Was great! I loved pizza and wings here. They are a perfect east coast pizza place! Amazing for being in the heart of chandler."}
{"text":"Food was great and my husband ordered combo of Italian sausage and Italian beef on garlic bread (or get Italian bread) with or without melted mozzarella cheese and I got the meatball sandwich on garlic bread with sweet peppers and both was so delicious.  Look so forward to going back!!  Had the Blackhawks game on for us which was great for us from Chicago.  Big portions and reasonable!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are awesome! I got the the sausage and beef combo and it was perfectly done...authentic Chicago style all the way"}
{"text":"I've driven by this little store a few times and was apprehensive since it was so small and I had never heard of it.

I came on a Wednesday right at noon and it was fairly quiet. The owner is a really nice guy from the Northwest Chicago suburbs. We started chatting and he said normally it is extremely busy at lunch time when Chandler High School is in session. 

He said his specialty is the Italian Beef with cheese. I elected to try it without the cheese, dipped with Giardiniera. He also stated he uses garlic bread but can serve it on Italian bread. I thought it was really good and will definitely be back to try the pizza. 

Good prices, good food and supporting a small business = 4 stars (at least). I will update after trying the pizza."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza, crispy crust, real mozzarella, and sweet sauce. Very friendly owner who makes you feel welcome. Smaller place but absolutely worth the try if you enjoy great pizza, especially thin crust."}
{"text":"Amazing, come for the good, stay for the conversation! This is a legit, authentic Chicago eatery. Dogs, pizza, tamales, hot wings and it's all excellent!

Our family was passing through and looking for a place to get off the road for a few minutes. Such a good choice. The kids are already asking if we can drop by again on the way back next week."}
{"text":"By far the best \"Chicago style\" pizza I've ever had!
The owner is great guy and always makes sure you are happy with the food and service. I drive the extra 15 minutes for the food! The All-star sandwich is awesome!"}
{"text":"It's good to find a quality Chicago style thin crust pizza and Italian beef sandwich . Took my daughter today. Parked out back and a gentleman told me just to knock on the back door instead of walking around the building. We entered threw the kitchen. Was offered a free soda while I waited and he even took off the change to make my order a even dollar amount. Once the pizza and sandwich was done they walked the pizza out to the car with my daughter and I because she is only 16 months old and I was holding her. Just all around great experience. 

Get home and the food is so good. I already send pictures of the pizza to a few family members and friends and will continue to recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you enjoy thin crust pizza you'll love this place. The ingredients was quality, the sauce was very flavorful, the crust is good and the prices are decent. I live in the area and ordered delivery which was prompt and professional. I Definitely Recommend this place for those looking for good pizza options in Chandler. Honestly, some of the best pizza I've had since living here in Phoenix for the past 7 years. And I'm a Midwest native so I know good pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Try the Italian beef sandwich yum. Lunch is packed with high schoolers. Follow my Yelp reviews!"}
{"text":"I tried the sausage, jalapeno and pepperoni pie today.  It wasn't bad.  The sauce is a southside sweet.  And I was looking for a little more flavor from the sausage and sauce.  I grew up in Woodstock before I moved down to AZ so I'm used to Napoli Rosatis and Buddyz.  If you're gonna slap a Chi-town label on it, it needs a bit more kick.  But all in all, not a bad midwest square cut, thin crust pie."}
{"text":"Although the Pizza was not what we were expecting, (Chicago...hinted deep dish...) the menu does read thin crust, we were not let down. The pizza crust was done well, light and crisp. While the sauce and toppings were wonderfully portioned. We tried the 16\" Pepperoni and 12\" cheese. Flavor was good and the total price was $26 plus tax. To our surprise the owner threw in a 2 liter of Coke. All in all, I'd say good pizza, good value, and service was EXCELLENT! I look forward to exploring their menu on our next visit. Slice of Chicago offers more than just pizza. If you're wondering about payment, they take credit/debit card via square."}
{"text":"This is some doggone good pizza. Ribs are pretty good too. Owner and his brother are super cool and friendly... and they make some dam good pizza. Haven't tried the wings yet, but judging by the quality of their other items I am confident they are great"}
{"text":"The chicken was so overcooked the bones were cracked and the marrow was leaking out. Several pieces were like this. Of the two dozen wings I ordered there was one drumstick.  The other 23 pieces were other parts of the wing other than the drumstick. I called the store to complain. The owner said he would \" make it up to me\" next time I ordered. I will never go bad!"}
{"text":"OK, Finally tried this place a second time.. And not sure what the \"RAVE\" is all about, maybe just the pie cut into squares, or the bread not folding over when you pick it up, even though its thin crust and not too hard or crunchy,,, but that's not my \"thing\" I guess.. I go for more of a flavor perspective.. 

The sauce, definitely not straight from a can, but didn't have any umpf or anything that would make me lick it off a spoon... Crust, was crust, with no significant flavor to call out either, some herbs, garlic, something would have been nice. The Cheese, was good, and probably the best part of the pie.. 

The Chicken Strips ,,, Now we have an Item I would actually go back for... sad, as this is a pizza joint... 

Best of Luck to ya !"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza and fantastic wings!!!! Service was excellent too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's not a pizza place anymore it's a bar.  It says my post has to be longer so I will say this it's not a pizza place anymore it's not even with the same name it is a bar I hope this is long enough for Yelp."}
{"text":"Saw all the reviews on yelp so I decided to try it. So glad I did! The cheese pizza was really good. My family said the pepperoni was just as good! I'm glad I found this place. Really tastes like Chicago pizza!! The owner is absolutely amazing!! This will definitely be my go to for pizza from here on out!"}
{"text":"If you were looking for a truly authentic mom and pop Chicago pizza place this is a must! The sauce was perfect plenty of toppings lots of cheese we're about 3 miles away by the time we brought it home it was still nice and warm! This is definitely our top pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night after looking from a change from the usual SE valley pizza scene. Stopped into Slice of Chicago and had an awesome experience. Chicago-raised wife give it all the thumbs up."}
{"text":"Flavor!!-A pizza that u could taste the ingredients!!-The crust was thin (which I prefer) not over done or under done which is usually the case. The sauce was perfect and the ingredients were quality especially the sausage and the peppers.My new goto thats for sure. Im excited to go back and try the ribs !! Thank you CY for your hospitality and excellent service !!"}
