{"text":"Creamy Custard Outstanding Italian Ice what a COOL place on a hot summer day"}
{"text":"Wow,  what a delicious surprise! Never had Italian ice with custard before, but lots of friends were telling me I just had to try CJ's.   They were right, it really hit the spot.  A nice refreshing change from all the frozen yogurt spots I've been hitting up.   I'll be back soon to experiment with some new flavors, and cool off during the hot summer."}
{"text":"A friend of mine came in from New Mexico Jeff is a car builder he really enjoyed the girls at CJS they may have something different everyday he just loved it what a great place and has really great employees they will go out of their way to make you whatever you want and they do it with a smile on their face"}
{"text":"I really had high expectations going to this placed based on yelp reviews. Having lived in Jersey, PA, etc., I read and heard great things.   All I can say is this place is essentially average. I've been to hundreds of ice places in the Country and this place just doesn't stack up.  I tried both strawberry and chocolate. The strawberry tasted as if you melted a Dole strawberry popsicle down, you'd pretty much get the same taste. Chocolate was as if you melted down a Marinos brand Italian ice from the supermarket.  Many east coast natives that live in Vegas I spoke to about this place told me to stay away if I wanted authentic, but I gave in.  The 2nd star is for the owner; guy seems super nice and made the place very welcoming."}
{"text":"Great service and great custard/Italian ice . We go here all the time. The cotton candy is my favorite"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on the way home, and what a find it was! I've only had Italian gelato before, so I was not exactly sure how much of a difference was Italian Ice and custard, but the ladies behind the counter were more than willing to help give a clear explanation to me when they found out it was my first time here.   Their menu doesn't seem very... crazily unique at a glance. They have their Italian ices (which are similar to sorbets) and custards (more egg-based than ice cream from what I hear?) in different flavors, the Concretes (which are like a Dairy Queen Blizzard), and then you have the gelatis. It's basically a cup with custard on the bottom, Italian ice, and some more custard on the top. I didn't know what else to get at the time, so I decided to get that. Took my first bite, and wow not bad at all. I was actually impressed!  The only complaint I can make, especially with their gelatis, is that at times it can be a little too sweet once you eat more of your gelati, and this is even coming from someone who has a slightly higher sweet tolerance than most people (so that's really telling you something)! I had a gelati with vanilla custard and a peaches and cream Italian Ice and at times I really did find myself liking the Italian ice a LOT more than the custard itself, which was sad because a good portion of the gelati was custard.   Sadly, I don't think I would want to get another gelati very soon. It was good for my first time, but a little too much and a little too sweet for someone like me. But their Italian ices are quite delish! Would definitely recommend for any one of those hot Vegas summer days."}
{"text":"Off the hook... This is the Italian ice that I grew up with back in Brooklyn new york...hands down the best Italian ice in Vegas no franchise in town can come close to CJ,s.. I'm a basic lemon and chocolate guy. The chocolate is delicious and lemon dosent have that acid after taste. ... The store itself is very clean and family friendly as is the owner....they have a Mobil truck and can come to your home for any event.. 5 thumbs up. Great Italian ice and they also have custom ice cream cakes for any occasion and custard to die for......."}
{"text":"Tried them at the Las Vegas Food Fest this past weekend. Very good ice which is hard to find in Las Vegas.  I like the flavor selection as well, both the cherry and black cherry were great. I enjoyed the cherry pieces in the cherry ice.  Have not yet tried the ice cream but that will be next on the list, too bad they are way across town."}
{"text":"The best! Came here after my sons soccer practice because it was right acroos the street and over 100 degrees. I got a waffle bowel with almost all the toppings lol. The guy gave them to me in a lil cup which was nice so I got more then if he would have topped me off. My son got the ice with vanilla ice cream and it was sooo good. I would really recommend it."}
{"text":"The custard and ices are real good, lots of variety. Would of been nice if the cashier would have given us chance to use the 10% discount."}
{"text":"If your thinking about going to dairy queen think again.  This place has great custard as well as customer service, not to mention all the flavors of Italian Ice.  I will be visiting much more frequently now that summer is arriving."}
{"text":"I tried a gelati with the mint chocolate chip and chocolate on top. I loved it! It's super rich though, do the small was definitely the right size to get. The price wasn't bad and the guys working there gave us samples and we're super nice! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here a while back great place great staff met the owner nice people.  Alot of variety interesting choices. I Would recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I can't imagine anything better.....The Cherry Ice is AMAZING! I stop by at least once a week and could care less about the health of an Italian Ice...it's a treat. Love Love Love!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. John helped us and was super sweet. He was by himself and super busy but he still went the extra mile to scoop out my concrete into my chocolate waffle cone AND add some chocolate sauce! How awesome is that? Superb customer service. I will be definitely be recommending this place to everyone and coming back frequently."}
{"text":"How does this place have good reviews??? Yuck!! This isnt custard. I don't know how people think this is good custard. Me and the 5 people I went here with took a few bites and thew it out! It leaves a waxy taste in your mouth. Also, the place was very dirty...a big turn off.....this place has got to close in a matter of time."}
{"text":"We were told about this little gem by a local during our visit.   We stopped in to try it and it was wonderful!  Great ice and custard, nice atmosphere, super nice owner/staff and good prices.   Next time we get off the plane in Vegas we will be heading straight to CJs for a treat!"}
{"text":"Best ices I've had in Vegas...by far. My wife loved the original vanilla custard.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love Cj's!!! I love custard and I haven't found good custard in Vegas. I love just getting a soft serve of chocolate custard. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"For anyone with a sweet tooth, this is the place to be. They have a range of flavors on their menu and different combinations of Italian ice and custard.   My personal favorite is their gelati. The gal that makes it for me usually puts vanilla flavored custard at the bottom, cotton candy flavored Italian ice, then more vanilla custard at the top. It's like taking a bite out of heaven. For a decent price, and because I was dying to have some friends and family taste their Italian ice, I bought some of their buckets in the freezers found on the left side of their counter. I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for something memorable and sweet to eat!"}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times and enjoyed every visit , I've had the lemon , cherry , watermelon and cantaloupe flavored ice's. The  first couple times I just had the small ice's . Lemon was, well lemony and sweet not very tart ,but I don't really like tart so this worked for me. The cherry was also good ,but lemon win's for me.                          The 3rd time I went I figured out what a gelati is and oh boy ,winner!      The gelati is Italian ice and custard in one bowl , genius !! Not me ,but the person who invented gelati . I had the watermelon and cantaloupe ice w/ vanilla custard . The cantaloupe flavor was strong ,the watermelon was not as good ,but I'm a freak for watermelon so I enjoyed it.       It's been open for a few month's  and I just kept on driving by thinking it was some type of snow cone,  Duh! So past few weeks wife and I have been playing catch up and enjoying every spoonful !"}
{"text":"I went to this custard place to try it since I have heard good things. I tried the pumpkin custard. It was amazing! I also had some type of ice that an employee recommended. I didn't really like the ice but I think it had something to do with the flavor I picked. I'll have to give the ice another chance but the custard is definitely delicious and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tangerine Italian ice and vanilla custard. ENOUGH SAID! Best dessert I've ever had. They call it the gelati and the combinations are endless. Friendly staff and delicious desserts, def recommend!"}
{"text":"The custard is too thick, and gluey.  I go to Henderson when I want frozen custard to Mr. D's on Eastern. It's fabulous."}
{"text":"I always go here after golfing. They have the best custard and a lot of flavored to choose from. They also have very good customer service."}
{"text":"I grew up in Philly so water ice and rita's water ice were common place. My wife and I often talked about finding a good place for water ice.  Well we found it!   We have tried most the flavors, Right now the mango gelati is my favorite.   We have gotten CJ's 4 times in the first week or two since it opened.  With summer right around the corner I'm sure we will be back many more times."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the staff is super friendly. A wide variety of flavors, very clean, and portions are generous."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is delicious! The atmosphere is great, nice colors and music is playing. Also anyone can use their dry erase markers and write a review or just draw for fun on the walls!  The custard is so creamy, beats out any of these frozen yogurt joints. Also the Italian Ice is made at the store. I know this because I asked the owner Jon who is super friendly and very interested in making his customers happy!  They have many flavors of ice, and your standard custard flavors chocolate and vanilla but they also have a flavor system where you can mix in over 20 flavors! They rave about the blueberry cheese cake concrete. Yea they have malts, milkshakes and super thick \"concretes\".   I won't go anywhere else! And very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Our group of four had a nice after dinner treat at this great ice cream shop. Great variety of flavors and types, quality ingredients and helpful service. What more could anyone want?"}
{"text":"This is the best custard I've ever had.  I loved Carvel when I was younger, but CJ's is even better.  The vanilla custard is particularly rich and delicious.  The staff is very nice.  We go several times a week during the summer, and it is always a nice experience."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love, LOVE this place. Of the ice places I've been able to find in Vegas this is by far the best. The flavors change often and are always refreshing. The staff is amazing and always so helpful. I love that they have daily specials and that you can take quarts home for your freezer! Now that its getting hot out again this will for sure be a regular stop even though its out of my way! And I'm hoping to see the new bus around town more since I saw it at the foodie fest."}
{"text":"I used to go to Rita's until I discovered CJ's! The custard is amazing. If you are extremely hungry or want to share a delicious dish, try the brownie sundae. They switch up some of their flavors occasionally so seasonal flavors are always something to look forward to. The owner and employees are very friendly and do a great job."}
{"text":"Perfect for hot summer nights. Great selection so everyone was happy from the kiddo to those young at heart. We had banana italian ice, strawberry and vanilla custard gelati and concrete with vanilla and pb cups. The concrete was really fantastic, better than other custard shops in town. The gelati was the best I've had since Frozen Aces closed years ago."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Everyone is so friendly and their custard is delish!  I especially enjoy the custard sandwiches.  I think I'm officially addicted."}
{"text":"They will definitely be giving Luv-Its a run for their money.  The service was super-friendly and I love the set up.  I went for the frozen custard and they had chocolate, vanilla and strawberry.  BUT...they had a long list of flavors they could blend with the vanilla (not like mix-ins, they have those, too).  So, I opted for the rum flavored frozen custard with a caramel sauce mix-in and sea salt.  It wasn't even on their list of multiple chunky choices (oreos, butterfinger, cherries, pb cup, etc.), but when I asked if any of their toppings were salted (I was hoping for salted nuts), this was their suggestion and it was delicious!  The custard had a great, super-rich mouthfeel and the \"regular\" size I chose was quite generous.   I can't wait to go back and try some of the other combos."}
{"text":"I love this place a great deal. The first time I visited I had my Mastiff service dog with me and every time thereafter, they gave me a small cone of vanilla for him to enjoy with us. I have to say the custards are so rich and creamy, my favorite being the Salty Carmel! Yummy!  I also appreciate their variation in flavors and absolutely love how they support \"furry\" kids as much as the two legged ones.  5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Best Italian ice by far! Great reminder of my home NY! Thanks for bringing a piece of our home to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I stopped by while in Las Vegas while on vacation. I am from the East coast. This place blew Rita's out of the water. With their 40+ flavors of ice and 40+ flavors of custard, prices were good in relation to the sizes offered. I wish we had a place like this on the East coast. I now tell anyone visiting Las Vegas, that this is a must visit."}
{"text":"I came here because a friend of mine came here and sent me a picture, so I felt obligated to try it considering how it looked appetizing. The young lady that helped me was extremely nice, she was very well read in what they were serving and helped us greatly. Now, on to the selection. CJ's has a fantastic variety of Italian ices, unfortunately I only had the opportunity to try their signature Gelati. The Gelati is simply italian ice with one layer of custard (your choice of vanilla or chocolate), two layers of Italian ice (flavor of your  choice) topped with custard. I got a regular size which filled me up nicely, and the quality was absolutely fantastic. The custard was just as good as Luv-Its which is currently my favorite custard joint. And the italian ice (Dr. Pepper.) was equally as good. I will certainly be back here."}
{"text":"The flavors are not true to the names. The Watermelon flavor tasted like liquid Amoxicillin. Also the customer service was not up to par. They were extremely inattentive, I was left at the counter for about 15 minutes without so much as a look and the woman behind me was overcharged. There was a very nice girl working who apologized for the inconvenience and an extremely rude girl who managed to ruin the entire experience for me and my family."}
{"text":"Lemon ice! The best ice. Good custard too, but the ice is where its at. Amazing texture and bold flavor. Cherry: the kind that makes your tongue bright.   I love it thar they wholesale all over town. CJs makes a great dessert. Pick some up. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"WOW. This place was SO good! This is definitely worth going to. The custard is amazing and the Italian is awesome."}
{"text":"Okay.. so I've been looking for a place like Rita's on my new side of town (Spring Valley) and my husband and I tried out this gem tonight.   While I must say that I am a little thrown by the pink gorilla mascot.. this place is amazing.   Ordered a mango ice and vanilla custard gelati which is a perfect blend of creamy and tart, and my husband got a peanut butter chocolate shake.. we also decided to take home a quart of the Oreo marshmallow custard (eep! Can't wait!). The total was around $17 which I thought was totally fair. Portions were maybe a little small, but honestly I could not handle more than the \"regular\" size, it was a perfect after dinner dessert.   I have a feeling our freezer will be stocked up with their many custard and italian ice flavors in no time."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service! Even from the owner Jon! I was on a very light diet and couldn't eat much! 2X I went in and purchased 6 tubs of their Italian ice... On my second trip to CJs I was dbl charged and two days later I was alerted by my CC company that there was a double charge on the same day for the same amount (think goodness for my cc company notifying me!) I contacted CJs and the girl who answered was very helpful and said she remembered me! She said she would have the owner \"Jon\" call me... Two days later and the owner never called to resolve my problem! So I had to file a claim with my CC company! They refunded the money to my CC and sent me a letter to verify the double charge! I contacted the owner Jon since I was disappointed he never tried to resolve my issue! He was rude, disrespectful and basically made me feel like I was lying about the whole thing! I even sent him copies of my CC statement and a letter from my CC company and he still was trying to tell me that it was a \"soft\" charge and would have just fell off! It was a hard charge and both of them went through! But I still couldn't get him to understand that! I spent $34 each time I went into CJs and would have continued to be a customer and spend money had I not been treated so poorly! The second employee I had talked to before I spoke to Jon was even ruder and told me she needed to contact the first girl I spoke to so she could verify my story! Straight out like that! Basically called me a liar to my face and that she didn't believe me! Unbelievable that anyone could run a business like this! Be careful using your CC or debit card at this place because if they double charge you, they will deny deny deny and call u a liar too! SMH! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I loved it! Haven't really been to other Italian Ice or Custard places but speaking from my first time experience, it was delish!  My boyfriend & I decided to try it out one random hot Sunday night. Had the Cotton Candy & Grape Italian Ice Combo. Usually Cotton Candy is too \"Cotton Candy-y\" but it wasn't like that at all, I liked it. The man tried a Gelati with this RedWhite&Blue Italian Ice (Forgot the name sorry!). He very much enjoyed the vanilla custard on the bottom and top of the Italian Ice. He tries to do that with an Icee at Sam's Club & they look at him all weird. Hahaha!  Really liked it, good alternative to ice cream or frozen yogurt. I wish service was a little better for first timers. Recommendations & enthusiasm about the products would've been appreciated too since it was our first. But we just went with the flow and ordered what sounded good."}
{"text":"Very good. Very good tasty. Some very creative flavors. Tuesday's they have great promotions for quarts."}
{"text":"Its not just an ice shop. Best custard in Vegas hands down! Try a custom flavor, we love their sprite and Swedish fish flavor. In fact we bring all our friend and family in from out of town too. You wont be sorry. Hey they all bring their truck to bug events too."}
{"text":"In a weather like this 106 degrees you need CJ! I was craving for a cold drink or ice cream and I was passing by and thought about the custard ice cream. Stopped by and got me a regular vanilla twist. Yummy! I will always keep coming back. I like the fact hat whenever I come here is not busy. Love it."}
{"text":"This is my kids all time favorite treat place. They have such fun flavors in Italian ice, custard and Gelati. Reasonably priced and you can chose the size you want or even take it to go!  I love the cute waffle bowls and cones.   You can customize the way you want and add toppings. They have a lot of topping choices from candy, fruit, nut and cereal.   My kids  fav is root beer and captain america. The staff is happy to give you a taste of whatever you want to try.  Don't forget your punch card.. after every 5 items you get one free!"}
{"text":"Great selection of flavors and they can customize flavors too. Awesome service and nice clean atmosphere. It's right across Desert Breeze Park."}
{"text":"So yummy. I love CJ's. Baylee is a rock star. The employees here are always awesome. In my opinion they have the best custard."}
{"text":"Had a vanilla custard with cookie dough. It was really creamy and tasted pretty good. It didn't taste overly sweet and had a strong vanilla flavor. Make sure you check in before you order because they give you a discount."}
{"text":"The place was empty, but the staff still made us feel a bit rushed --granted, we were a group of 5 people who were taking a while to order because none of us had been there before-- but the workers were kind, and helpful.  This ice cream place was recommended to me by a friend who frequents Las Vegas, so I was very excited to give this place a try.   I ordered the gelati, a combination of some sherbet with a top layer of soft serve, and it did not disappoint. There are tons of options, so it wouldn't hurt to do some research before heading over. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and I'll definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Recently fell in love with Italian ice at another chain in the area, decided to see how CJ's compares- cool to see that they offer grab and go options, and also have additional desserts in the form of ice cream sandwiches and customization options like specialized toppings and waffle bowls.  Black cherry and chocolate ices are solid but I went with my favorite standby, root beer, which always tastes perfect when topped with custard. Here, they pack the cup with ice then top it with a tower of custard- a bit too much for my preferences, but good value at under $5 for a regular which was three servings for me.  I prefer a smaller ratio of custard to my ice, but the custard here (vanilla) also had a weird metallic aftertaste that I wasn't fond of. Not sure if it's specific to the vanilla, something to do with the ice-and-custard flavors playing off of on another, or perhaps an issue with the machinery, but I'll be by to try again."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, as it's much closer to our home than Luv-It Frozen Custard.  I've tried it twice, and unfortunately, I have to report that their frozen custard is full of artificial flavors and tastes like it was made from a powdered mix.  It does not taste at all like the fresh, creamy, natural tasting custard you can get at Luv-It Frozen Custard.  Sorry.  I also tried the Italian Ice and it too was full of artificial flavors.  The Italian Ice served at say, Rocco's NY Pizzeria in Canyon Gate is far better.  It may not be any more natural, but at least it didn't leave a chemical aftertaste.  I've given this place three tries and we won't be going back.  Other places may be a much longer drive, but are worth it.  Given how particular some people can be about items like custard and Italian Ice, I'm surprised the ratings aren't worse."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Smells of candy when you walk in. The custard is rich, and the ice is delish. But haven't found anything that competes with those Chy-town Italian ice vendors."}
{"text":"Got: twist concrete with cookie dough. The custard in the concrete is okay, but the concrete itself is filled with way to much of the toppings. You can't get a spoon of the custard without several pieces of the topping in it. Kinda a let down since the custard has potential but the whole concrete is a waste with all those toppings. P.s. the small and large look different but are the same size in volume"}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff, My favorite is definitely the italian ice. I buy quarts at a time."}
{"text":"Wow!  The custard is rich and sweet and the combination of a tangerine and vanilla in a gelati was the best take on a creamsicle I've ever had.  The staff is friendly and helpful! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin with this place. First of all the custard and Italian ice are amazing! There are so many flavors to choose from. My favorite is the sweetish fish (seasonal flavor) Italian ice with vanilla custard gelati. The atmosphere is fun and the place is always filled, however the wait is never long. Employees there are young, kind, and always smiling. The owner is very welcoming! Don't forget to get your tub to go too when you leave, there are two freezers filled with flavors already prepackaged and waiting."}
{"text":"Love the Italian ice and custard is amazing. Great staff who remember us!!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night, very first time. My son and wife got the Capt America Italian Ice and I got concrete, salted caramel and cappuccino swirl with Reeses peanut butter cups.   My son is loving the Capt America and I'm digging on mine.   First time visit, check in with Yelp and it's 10% off. Not bad. A bit pricey but definitely worth it. You can even get a punch card for frequent visits.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"I just figured out they sell their Italian ice by the cartons! Yay! Plus they have these loyalty cards where you have to buy 5 items to get all the holes punched out then the 6th item is free. & If you save 4 cards you get a free t-shirt or hat! I already finished my first card!"}
{"text":"Nice spot offering italian ice and custard. I often go for the gelati a mix of italian ice and custard, that you can mix and match a lot of different flavors to create some unique combinations.   Be sure to get a stamp card when you visit as they not only offer free menu items after a few stamps they also offer merchandise for collecting a number of fully stamped cards!"}
{"text":"The custard is delicious.  it is super creamy, and has that creamy custard taste.  This is what real custard should taste like.  The italian ices are great.  I love how they are always changing the flavors, so there is always something new to try.  I have had many flavors and they are all good.  I almost always get a gellati which is the best of both worlds, custard and ice.    The staff is friendly and very nice.  They are always helpful and willing to give out samples.  The owner is super nice.  Its nice to walk into a place and be greeted by friendly and happy workers."}
{"text":"The gelato was pretty good and the atmosphere of the store was fun! I'm taking away a star because they recommended a fruity flavor to go with my friend's choice of twist custard (vanilla and chocolate) and the end result was not that great. He's not from this country either and wasn't sure what was going on. But overall, pretty nice establishment!"}
{"text":"Never had iced custard or gelati before but my hubby, Austin, went into cjs and got us a mango vanilla gelati and it was amazing! It was so perfect for this preggo lady to cool off during this heat wave. I wanted to stick my face in this gelati.... actually I wanted to bathe in it. Reminds me of a frozen orange Creamsicle but mango. Hubby met the owner John, and he's super nice. I guess they clicked on man stuff and all that jazz. Will be back when I'm on that side of town. Or I'll send hubby on a craving chase."}
{"text":"This place was far from where we live but we took a special trip over due to Instagram lol. We saw awesome pictures of all the treats they offer here and it was worth the drive. I got a chamango and loved it. The portion is huge by the way. My SO got the spicy Sandia and enjoyed it. I tried it and it wasn't my favorite but it didn't taste bad at all. If I'm ever in the area I will try something else like their bobalatis ! Staff was also really good at making these treats too! Prices are fair for how much you get! Will return when I can."}
{"text":"Word of mouth finds me at Cj's Italian Ice and Custard. The friendly server allowed me to sample a myriad of ices, from bubblegum to mango, all of them delicious. I then tried the custard. The mint was just ok., the apricot, absolutely spectacular, I finally settled on pumpkin. I have returned  for 7 straight days since. The pumpkin custard has layer after layer of flavor. It tastes exactly as home made pumpkin pie. All the custards I tried taste better than the original. You get a jolt of pure flavor. It has no lingering after taste. I can eat a large amount of custard without feeling overly full. I am told that it is an egg based custard. Of course it still has dairy, but this custard has a bit more protein and fewer calories than the norm.             When the italian ice is scooped, you can see that there  is not a single ice crystal that typically forms around the inside of ice cream tubs. The high quality becomes obvious. The ices are tasty without being overly sweet. The flavors taste pure.  After several visits, I was convinced to try an italian ice and custard mix. I ordered mango ice and pumpkin custard. My diet is temporarily on hold."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is perfect !!! They have such a variety and everything looks delicious !!! We tried the spicy Sandia and it was literally perfection in a cup !!!! I can probably rant on and on about how good this place is but I won't to save time . but if you haven't tried CJ's before you die , you haven't lived life to the fullest."}
{"text":"Gelati's are a must try here. Custard, Italian ice and more custard all swirled together in a cup. Vanilla or chocolate custard is available, as well as 12 or so different ice flavors. Samples are also given if you can't make up your mind. The most popular flavors are lemon, cherry, blue raspberry and rootbeer.  I had mine with vanilla custard and cotton candy ice. It was sweet, creamy and delicious. I got a small, and it was definitely filling. Check out the freezers, they have many different custard flavors for you to take home. They also have cakes too. Make sure to get a stamp card, after 5 purchases, the 6th is free. The last time I was in I forgot my stamp card, so the girl working the counter gave me a new one and said when I found the other one we could just combine them, sweet!"}
{"text":"It was delicious!  Had the sundae... peanuts, cherries, hot fudge and the swirl custard.  YUM!"}
{"text":"great placeeee  we  found this gem it's too bad we live the other side of town!!!! but we will make sure to come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Get the $5 for $10 yelp deal!  On recommendation from the staff, I tried out the gelati (custard + italian ice) with vanilla custard and passion fruit gelati. The custard contains too much egg for my taste and is overwhelming. On the other hand, I really like the italian ice here. The passion fruit was an excellent choice and I would just get the passion fruit italian ice alone if I came back.  I've also had a chance to try out the apple gelati and a concrete with heath bar chunks. The apple tasted too artificial for my preference and the concrete also contained the overwhelming egg flavor once again, although they were very generous with the heath add-ins.  The yelp deal makes this a good bargain. I would stick to the italian ice though if I were to come back."}
{"text":"Sporting no known colours found in the natural world, I would pass on this place.(1)  We walked into this place and it was virtually empty. We took a look around and saw what their product consisted of and I didn't want to really order anything. Seriously - neon coloured ices - is this for real?  I tried some of the gelati flavours that were begrudgingly offered  by the girl behind the counter. Automatically, I knew that the flavours came from a flavour lab somewhere because it certainly did not taste at all like anything that came from an actual fruit. Hell, the colours don't even look like something that came from anything known to man. Neon blue raspberry... what the f&^k is this? Ugh!  So my hubby gave me a look and asked me what we wanted to do. I shrugged. He basically ordered the strawberry concrete and we were on the way.   FYI - I am an ice cream hound and will pretty much eat any kind of crap ice cream out there. Even the old dixie cups hold their own allure for me which I must confess is a guilty pleasure.  But I couldn't have more than 1 bite of the custard because of how artificially sickeningly weird it tasted. It got way worse because as it was melting, it morphed  into this pale pink foamy stuff that resembled a cold runny marshmallow-y concoction which was obviously nothing dairy in origin. Hell, don't know what it was made of but it sure has hell ain't natural!  My husband ate a little more but threw the rest when we filled up on gas at Costco. All he could say was \"live and learn.\"  I would pass on this place - it's not good... not good at all."}
{"text":"I love the mix of different flavors, you can create your own with all the selections of toppings;  worth checking out if you are in the area"}
{"text":"You get this kid'ish nostalgia walking in. A sugar rush excitement inhaling the smell of cotton candy upon walking in.   What's \"Gelalti\"!!???!  A cup of your choice of custard(vanilla or chocolate) at the bottom layer, middle layer-your choice of italian ice, and top layer- custard. So it's full circle in flavor egg-based creamy goodyness.  The young lady behind the counter was so enthused to explain the process. Go girl!  I ordered the Gelati with vanilla custard and mango. It tasted perfect. Only thing for me is that I'm a light desserter. I can't really eat more than 6 ounces of sweetness and their only offerings are regular or large. Their regular was about 12 ounces. Perfect for a hearty sweet appetite, but i couldn't finish. So I do recommend sharing with someone if you're like me.  I like the cleanliness and space...  I wanna say this place is worth a try. I would only give it 5 stars if they went more exotic Italian ice flavors."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best spots in town  if you're craving some sweets. The custard they have here is simply amazing, they must have 20 + flavor of the custard. Then the Italian ice just speaks for itself , every time it go in I must try 10 samples.. Would recommend this place to everyone ! Especially during the summer!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best I've been to for Custard and Italian I've hands down. There selection of flavors combined with the overall way they build there flavors are extraordinary. I have been here a couple of times and will definitely be back for more, the staff is super friendly and helpful. Pricing is very fair, and the selection again, is amazing.  And another thing, you can take home tubs or your favorite flavors! They offer so many with super cool variety of names and colors. Love this place so much."}
{"text":"Always a big smile coming from the girls that work here when I arrive. They are friendly and funny. The custard and the girls are constantly battling for who is sweeter but I think it's a tie. The custard is so so refreshing on a hot day and there are so many toppings to choose from that I keep going to try a different one on the next time and I'm always satisfied.   'Sweet deets' is what this place is. One taste and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"About time I tried this place! Been meaning to try it for awhile but when. Your used to your usual go to place it's hard to break the cycle.  Loved that they have a stamp card, after your 5th purchase your 6th is free.   Didn't like how disorganized it was. Then again, they were really busy. 7 people ahead of me and a packed inside.  They have some many options that it was hard to choose. Gelato, custard, shakes, concrete mix,  and sundaes, root beer floats and banana splits.  Finally decided on German chocolate custard with Carmel sauce inside, going for the concrete. My husband got the pistachio with cheesecake bites inside. Sounds gross but he said it was great. A little over priced for us. Especially when it came to over 10 bucks, almost 11. I was really good, and an usual flavor but I think this will just be a special occasion place . We shall stick to our yogurtland."}
{"text":"First time trying it today and I can't wait to go back. Such great flavors to choose from.  Had the cotton candy and custard cup today. Yum yum. Staff was very friendly here. Quite busy, it seems like a popular place. I recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"So happy I finally checked this place out. I got a regular sized gelati with strawberry and vanilla custard. It was amazing and surprisingly a very good size for the price. Check in on yelp and get 10% off! Also, ask for a stamp card. You only need to fill up 5!!  I was very happy with my visit here. The girl that helped me was really cheerful. She didn't try to rush me while I was checking out the flavors which is a huge plus. To be honest, with it being my first time going there, I was a little intimidated by not knowing what to order. I'm glad she made it a pleasant experience. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Well this is different. And delicious!!  There's a purple yam and coconut Italian ice that is so good!!!  I tasted it after I'd already ordered. But my bubble gum Italian ice and vanilla gelati is really yummy too.  Clean place and fast, friendly service. A+!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Italian ice... when I saw the Yelp deal, I was all over it. I've had Italian ice in all parts of the east coast, and CJ's did not make the cut.   I order both a gelati and Italian ice. My gelati consisted of pistachio cream ice and vanilla custard. I will say that if I was just reviewing the pistachio cream ice, it would receive 5 stars. It's amazing! No complaints. However, everything else I put in my mouth had entirely way too much sugar! My Italian ice had a mixture of mango and tangerine. There was no fruit bits, which you usually get in Italian ice. It was very artificial tasting, and sweet of course. The custard was simply forgettable.  I definitely recommend Rita's in Green Valley over CJ's."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriends first time trying and it's amazing ! Place is clean & the employee was super nice ! Definitely will be coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"I really love a good chocolate custard with Butterfinger crumbles and needed to fulfill a craving last night. Now, if you've ever been to Yogurt Beach in Reno, you know quality chocolate custard... They could teach CJ a thing or two!   CJ's chocolate custard is creamy, but lacks flavor! I couldn't tell I was eating chocolate because it tasted like vanilla. They make a good waffle cone, but I don't recommend toppings; they spill everywhere.   I'd like to try the Italian ice combo (Italian ice with vanilla custard) next time, only because it's their specialty."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Reminds me of NY. My boyfriend and I fo here often and just love it! The staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"delicious treats, you would think that getting the combo of italian ice and custard would be the best, but the flavors end up mixing together and the custard smooshes into the italian ice. Personally i like eating them separately. So bring a date, each of you get 1 itialian ice and the other get the custard and share. the next dilemma is which yummy flavor to get.they also have a frequent buyer card, score!"}
{"text":"Hail Mary, this place is amazing. I always get the concrete with Oreos. My daughter is lactose and tolerance so she gets the boba icee one. Always so so delicious."}
{"text":"Wish I had read the reviews before I bought the coupon on LivingSocial. Since I had already purchased the deal I went anyway and realized the reviews complaining of chemical flavors were correct. All of the Italian ice flavors tasted \"off\", nothing like real flavors or colors. I got plain custard and my friend got a gelati. He said the Italian ice didn't taste as bad when mixed with the custard. The custard didn't taste all that \"real\" either. We each ate about 10 bites of our food and pitched the rest. If you are the type of person that prefers \"natural\" food, then stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Amazing my new craving and amazing customer service mix Cherry and lemon with vanilla ice cream yummy .. Cj lets u sample them all . Fun family place too after dinner to take the kids .."}
{"text":"Going to CJ's is a real treat! It always hits the spot. No matter what you're looking for, they got it!!  Super fast and friendly service. The price is right too! My favorite is the concrete made with the custards! I get pretty much anything I want mixed it, can't go wrong with the gelati either! So many flavors so little time! Definitely a great year round spot for treat! Thanks CJ's!!"}
{"text":"Come on what could be better than a night with my boy getting him an Italian ice?  It's sometimes just about the time with the special people in your life"}
{"text":"This place was just okay to me. I got the watermelon ice with vanilla custard. The ice was too syrupy tasting and only somewhat tasted like watermelon, but the custard was good. Great idea, but just not for me."}
{"text":"Yummmmyyyyyy! Our first time here we went in with the kiddos and ordered lots of different flavors just to try them out (Swedish fish was pretty good). Second time around I ordered the frozen boba one with some \"taro\" gelato (its a Filipino yam) and it was ok... I wouldn't order it again. Third time, my husband went and bought the packaged tubs... let me Tell you... tangerine with vanilla custard is to die for!!! Root beer and Spunoni were good too, but the tangerine is by far my favorite!!! And our family's favorite too!!"}
{"text":"This place is soooooo amazing!!!!! They have the best Italian ice! They have flavors from coffee to mango to honey dew and the list goes on and on! They also serve frozen custard here too! It's amazingggg! The vanilla custard is something from out of this world! But the real reason I care here was to try the Sandia, it's made of mango ice topped with tajin and chamoy, then layers with watermelon ice and topped off with pineapple dole whip more tajin and chamoy, a strawberry, a watermelon slice and a tamarino straw! I added extra tamarin candy. Seriously the flavors take you through an entire journey! First you get the flavors on its own and then when it starts to melt the flavors together is out of this world! Great job for concocting such a marvelous thing! I also got extra pre packed ice and custard to take home and keep in my freezer! Now summer will not be so bad with this to look forward to!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended we go here for desert and we're glad we tried it.  It was different.  A nice change from ice cream.  The employees were helpful in choosing a selection.  It could have been cleaner."}
{"text":"This review is based on our most recent experience.  We have loved CJ's custard for two years now, and wanted to treat our friends from out of town to a tried-and-true treat.  Little did we know that we were in store for some truly FRIGID customer service...  When we walked in, the two girls on staff were occupied with two friends of theirs who were visiting.  This was fine, as we still needed some time to decide.  We asked to try the banana custard, to which one of the girls replied, \"Yeah\" and stood there, looking as if it would drop from the sky.  \"So, may I try it?\" we had to ask again, before she huffed and served us a sample.    We decided to buy two quarts to take home, as we were now embarrassed to have brought our guests to enjoy the concentrated angst of two teenagers.  I brought the two quarts up to the counter for purchase, and the second staff member did an excellent job of running the transaction, until the point came at which she turned around and began to organize toppings, never having given me a receipt nor a bag with which to carry home the dessert.  I waited for a couple of minutes, until our friend finally asked, \"May we please have a receipt and a bag?\"  The girl turned around as if she was surprised to see us there.  While CJ's quality has brought us back many times, I will be skipping this new brand of customer service and simply purchase it from Glazier's instead.  \"Meh\" service tells me that they have a \"meh\" view of customer loyalty."}
{"text":"So, I'm Vegas on my 50th Birthday retreat, and while having dinner at local friends house, she says, \"okay Pat, good to see you, gotta take my son to Basketball practice, didn't have time to make you dessert..\"  Ain't that about nothing??!!  Grrrrr. LOL  Did that stop Pat?  Nope.  Pat needed dessert...so as I was driving down Durango, I saw two words \"Ice\" and \"Custard\".  So I pulled over and decided to check out the place on Yelp, and up pops a message from Yelp. \"Congratulations, you get 10% off\".  Word??  That, coupled with the fact that the reviews were excellent - is all a brotha needed to know.  I told the young lady (cute, too) that I was in town for the week for my 50th Birthday and she was like \"yeah, right..you're not 50\".  I was like, \"do you need to see ID?\"  She just chuckled and then glared at me.  So I pulled out my AARP card and said, \"do I get an AARP discount here?\" and she was like \"OMG...well no...but I'll see what I can do for you\".  Not gonna tell you what she did, but the Tangerine and Vanilla Gelati was awesome!!!  No matter what time of year ya'll, check out CJ's when you're on that side of town in Vegas!"}
{"text":"What can I say about the heavenly concoctions that come out of this place? It's so good. My family just moved here and discovered it our first month here. We chose them because they're literally a mile from our home and I'm so glad we chose them!     So far, I've had their vanilla custard and their coconut Italian ice. They're heavenly! Their custard is thick, creamy, and so rich. And their Italian ice's texture kind of reminds me of a Popsicle meets an Icee, but so much more smooth. It's so delicious that my sister and I, who never spend our own money on food items, are more than willing to spend our own money on it every payday. If you're in for a ice cream or snow cone fix, go here. Their prices aren't bad and if you buy five of any item you get a sixth free, which we've already gotten."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and the most tasty custard on planet earth. The Italian ice was also a real treat. Highly recommended. Doing the monster challenge was a real chilling experience. xD I would do it again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Pro: Yum yum yum. I love their Captain America gelati. It's basically the only thing I get here. It reminds me of the bomb pops you get from the ice cream man. They also have a stamp card and I've already got enough for a free one. Yay!   Con: The service is great but the layout is awkward. Right when you step in the Italian ice is already staring at you. It's a bit claustrophobic when they've got a line."}
{"text":"This was terrible. The custard tastes so artificial I could barely eat two bites. The Italian ice was so artificial and sweet, it tasted like food coloring and ice. Barf.  Luv It is still the best in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here 3 or 4 times over the past month. The chocolate custard is the best I ever had. The Mrs. loves the custard and Ice combo. Vanilla with Tangerine ice is her favorite. The people there from John the owner to all the girls behind the counter are very nice and accommodating. The prices are very reasonable and they have a punch card. Buy 5 and get one free. We will continue going back and you should come and see what your missing."}
{"text":"Came with the girlfriend after lunch. Tasty, friendly and patient staff. You can only get two gelato flavors, though. Nothing bad can be said!"}
{"text":"My top custard place to visit in all of LV hands down. Fast friendly service. Thick creamy custard makes for delicious concretes. Fast friendly service.  Clean dining room. Wish they had another location in the north."}
{"text":"Got a cotton candy sorbet on top of vanilla custard with sprinkles. It was absolutely delish and not overly sweet. The custard was so nice and thick that I was afraid the plastic spoon they gave me would snap. The servers could be a little friendlier and less monotonous. They were helpful but gave me the impression that they just didn't want to be there. The store gives the ambience of a darker Baskin Robbins. For a nicer experience, my advice is to get your stuff to go and eat it at the nearby park."}
{"text":"Our family came to get some Italian ice and custard but I did see an ad for their boba custard and oh man! I am so glad we got some! We don't live in Las Vegas anymore but I will definitely keep this place in mind for when we come back! It's not too close to any of where my family lives but I would have to say it's worth the drive! I'm not too fond of Italian ice but this place was really good !"}
{"text":"I am a Philly girl, \"West Philadelphia, Born and Raised\", and one of the hardest things to have to adjust to living in Vegas, has been my summer's without waterice (Italian Ice for those of you not from Philly) Tried this place with my hubby and our friends who are also from Philly, and we give it a HUGE thumbs up!!  And trust me, We know our waterice!  It is the closest to the real thing that I have experienced since moving here.  Others have tried and failed miserably!!  CJ's is delicious!!!  You have undoubtedly, made summer more bearable here!!  I'll be in to visit you tonight!!"}
{"text":"Soo good. I ordered the chocolate and rasberry  ice with vanilla custard. I need to go back soon."}
{"text":"Our new addiction this summer. We keep going just to work our way through the menu.  Pros: Open late, quality is one of the bast I've had, they have a LARGE variety. There's even Ube flavor. It caters to lactose intolerant and lactose tolerant. Staff is super helpful and friendly, they also offer and stamp card for rewards, there's even a challenge they offer as well.  Cons: seating a lacking but it isn't that much different from and others typical shop in its industry."}
{"text":"This place is fun.  I mean... it's a custard, gelato place.  But the lighting and colors and everything just exudes \"fun\". Tasty creations that you get to mix and match.   Part of the fun is mixing and matching..... so if you are the indecisive sort... this might not be the best place for you because the options are limitless (it seems). I usually share whatever \"we\" order... because the custard is rich and the toppings sweet... so I just need a few bites to satisfy my cravings.   In fact, I highly recommend sharing... that way you won't feel so guilty for indulging in this yum-o-licious treat."}
{"text":"I got the concrete which is basically vanilla or chocolate custard with your choice of a topping. If you want more there's a .50 cent charge for each extra topping. You also get a 10% discount when you check in here.   I got vanilla custard with cookie dough. Their custard tastes so creamy and I loved every bite I took of it. It's also really thick which made me like it even more. Good treat overall!"}
{"text":"Review #247 - 2016  Showed up around 11:30 AM on Dec. 18th, not realizing that they don't open until noon.  There were a few people sitting inside so we walked up to the door and looked around, wondering why the doors were still locked.  I guess they were having a company meeting of sort since everyone there were store employees.  I guess the owner must have felt bad for us so he decided to open the door and told us that it was ok to come in.  That was so kind of him!  I ordered the same thing from before, the cheesecake custard, on a waffle cone this time.  It was delicious!  I shared it with my little angel and she loved it too!  Yep!  So glad we found this place!  Great people, indeed!"}
{"text":"Well, I reviewed CJ's awhile ago and later decided to close my account not realizing my review would be gone .... Sooooooo I'm back.  What can I say?  I've lived in this \"small town\" that thinks it's a big city since 06' having been born and raised on the east coast in Philadelphia.  One of my FAVORITE childhood memories is Pop's Water Ice in South Philly.  It was staple for me every weekend visiting my dad - back then we only had lemon, cherry, chocolate and vanilla (brown).    For the past six years - I've missed water ice dearly especially when it's hot outside. I was SOOOO happy when I tried this place that we come back at least once or twice a week.  The owner and staff are personable, friendly and provide great customer service.   The flavors are great and not overly sweet as compared to places like Rita's where your ice turns into a watery syrupy mess.     I'm still partial to my chocolate ice but I've tried just about every flavor they make and now that they're making my all time favorite mint chocolate chip cream ice - you can't get any better.  Prices won't break they bank and loyalty cards to boot.    EVERYONE should try CJ's oh and I'm not normally a custard girl but the custard is great as well.  Side note:  Was reading some of the other reviews - I've never had bad service in this place so perhaps you guys/gal went in with a bad attitude? We've always been treated with a smile from day 1. Mmmmmmmm - I love pink Amoxicillin - it was my childhood favorite.  I'll have to be sure to try the watermelon ASAP."}
{"text":"My husband from Philadelphia wanted to check this place out since he missed what he had back in Philly. Previous review that I saw on here which trashed this place seemed to not know what Italian water ice was. Italian water ice is completely different from Italian gelato. If anyone likes Rita's water ice, strongly recommended.   Location is great since it's right by the park and we can grab wanter ice before we take the dogs to the park!   My husband said that it tasted like Philly! I personally did not really know what to expect from this store but I really enjoyed it. I know this isn't the place to try something healthy. I enjoy something like this once in a while too!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely no expert when it comes to ice or custard but something just doesn't quite work right here. Being a huge fan of Rita's, my review is probably a little biased but I'll be as honest as possible.  First off, the customer service here is pretty much non-existent. As we walked in, we looked across the menu for a few minutes and one of the employee's said \"First time?\" but nothing more. Even after telling her yes and that we were unfamiliar with the menu, she didn't offer any help, samples, suggestions or even say anything at all. We were also never offered the \"punch card\" I've read about either.   Now, as far as the product goes it was \"ok\". I've been to Rita's a number of times and absolutely love the gelati so that's what I got here at CJ's. In my opinion, it just doesn't compare. The ice has an extremely \"artificial\" taste and I had the cherry ice which tasted like sno cone syrup. The custard was definitely creamy and the flavor wasn't bad but it had a very strong egg taste which threw me off. We also frequent Luv-It and the custard was no where near their offering. All in all it wasn't horrible, but it also wasn't great. Neither the custard or ice had natural taste or flavor that you can get at several other places in town.  I'm on the edge about giving this place 3 stars cause there was a few things that I really did like about this place. The first thing was the amount of custard flavors they offer. There are ton of choices but one huge downfall is they don't allow you to use the flavored custard in a gelati. In terms of the gelati itself, one other thing that really stood out was the amount of custard they use. If you've ever been to Rita's you know that they use a very small amount of custard for the bottom section of the gelati but at CJ's, the custard to ice ratio is just right. And the last thing that I enjoyed was the amount of seating available. I hate to do it but I'm going to make another comparison to Rita's because they only have 1 bench and it sucks having to eat outside on the curb especially when you have a fairly large group. On the other hand, it's understandable considering the space they have to work with.   I'm not a fan of making comparisons but when there are other places in town that offer the exact product with a much higher quality (in my opinion), it's hard not too. Having the Yelp \"$5 for $10\" was a nice way to try CJ's but I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon. The slightly further drive to Luv-It or Rita's is well worth it."}
{"text":"This dessert place was tops! Lots of options: Italian ice, gelato & \"pudding\". The BF & I bypassed Wendy's to try this highly rated place while we are visiting Vegas. Watching others order and trying to decide what we want to sample. We are both set on \"concrete\" as suggested by the customer ahead of us! Regular size is more than enough, check out the cup sizes"}
{"text":"Custard or gelato? They're both really favorable for me.  I'm not too big on Italian ice though. I enjoy the rich frozen desserts.  Their frozen custard here has a gooey texture, and becomes creamy once a spoonful meets your mouth. Savor worthy. Then add more gooey chewy mochi. Your set with an awesome dessert moment. Why would you need to kiss an exotic hunk? When you can just have Italian frozen custard with mochi. You get Italian and tongue action in a dessert!  Try the pistachio nut! I ordered it with vanilla, but next time I won't - cuz the pistachio has a really nice flavor. I wish they had nutella or hazelnut frozen custard, and espresso flavor. That woulda been a cup of a lifetime, and then repeat...  They were out of cookie crunch topping. I looked around, but there were no kids to point fingers at and blame it on. That's how I ended up getting mochi.  So this place is cool! There's a wall - all freezer doors with grab and go pints or bigger tubs. Plus more on the right side when you walk in. I didn't get to see or ask if they make frozen custard cakes. That would be awesome! Next time I'll check.  They want customers to come back! I know cuz the young lady helping me looked at me like I have 'sweet tooth' stamped on my forehead. I got a staaamp caaard - nanny nanny... But you should ask for one too if you don't have it yet. You buy 5 and get the 6th one free!     : D"}
{"text":"Really good custard with hot fudge and whipped cream - and the staff is great as well."}
{"text":"What a find! The inside and outside of this store screams ice cream! A lot of thought went into this shop and it feels like an authentic ice cream shop (a rarity in Vegas). We were welcomed by the super friendly owner who greeted us. I stopped in specifically for Italian ices. I bought 7 flavors. DELICIOUS! My husband got a chocolate cone and he said the ice cream was delicious (very rare for my husband to say!) We have many ice cream shops in our immediate area but with our cooler in tow we drove to this shop! They offer tons of italian ice and ice cream flavors and you can check the flavors of the day on their website. Also check the website because they sell their products at stores and restaurants throughout the valley. I have purchased their products at Glaziers Supermarket and Rocco's Pizzeria."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly good!!  The Matcha and Ube ice are so delicious... be careful, this place can be addictive to foodies.  My wife had the Pineapple Dole whip with frozen custard and boba tapioca.  That was amazing.  Our son had a scoop of the Sour Patch Kids Italian Ice-- this was next level!  The staff is friendly and the treats are a place to go try when you wanna get off the strip for a little bit."}
{"text":"Great alternative to ice cream, here you can pick custard and lots of different flavors of Italian ice. Try the ice tea and lemon ices, with custard on top! Just be aware that the portions are huge so i would suggest sharing or coming on a really, really empty stomach."}
{"text":"This place has potential...  Went to check out this place with Pratik W. a few days ago cause it was in the neighborhood. We had living social deal, which is pretty the same thing as the Yelp! deal they have now.  Walking in, the place was totally empty. Considering it was effing hot outside, I thought the place would be packed. I came in and told them that we had a living social deal and the two girls working there explained in long detail all the different stuff they had. Concretes seemed the same as any other custard place. The gellati from what it seemed like was just soft serve with a slurpee like frozen ice underneath. Unfortunately, according to the two working there, the our living social deal could really only get us a standard soft-serve custard (from the machines you pretty much see everywhere) or a gellati. We ended up going with some soft-serve. I was thinking about getting some mix-ins but each one was a dollar and was not under the deal...   We were served large tubs of the soft serve. I was disappointed in the fact that there was so actual gelato here. The custard was good, a step-above what you get a dairy queen, but it wasn't even close to Luv-It's frozen custard. I would have been happier with some golden swirl.  I couldn't help but laugh at the big cup of what is essentially soft-serve frozen yogurt we had. Realizing that I had  $10 credit, each one of our cups would have been $5 bucks each w/o the deal. Don't get me wrong, the 'custard' tasted good, but it was definitely wasn't 5 bucks good...  The serving was huge and to be honest, I got tired of eating it. We ended up dumping about a third of our cups and headed out. The whole experience was \"meh\" I might return and get a concrete, but then again part of me figures that if I am gonna spend $6-7 on ice cream, id rather go to golden swirl or Luv-It."}
{"text":"Saw this place on a Facebook video and we had to try it. The bobalati was so good. It's just nice knowing that there's a place in Vegas to get some ube ice cream. Thai tea ice cream, green tea ice cream and milk tea ice cream. I knew this place was here for awhile but never gave it a chance. I'm glad I cam across that video. Definitely coming here again. Also first time for me trying chamango in my life and I love it!! Also the girls that work here are awesome !!"}
{"text":"This is the ice cream spot for my girlfriend and I. It's Italian ice, so you have to be in the mood for that. But  the gelati is amazing. Root beer with vanilla soft serve... So good!  Very friendly staff and a very unique selection of ices to try. Great prices too! Can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"Good Italian ice flavors but in terms of custard, I would stick to Luv-It or Nielsen's.  Definitely worth it if you had the $5 for $10 Yelp deal!  Mango and passion fruit were my favorite Italian ice flavors.  The custard is definitely thick and egg-y but not good as a stand alone custard.  I used the custard to give the Italian ice some richness."}
{"text":"One word: gelati My daughter LOVES the cotton candy with vanilla. Ive had vanilla with lotsa flavors and its bomb.com! Did coconut ice with chocolate and it was heavenly. Cant go wrong and its priced well for what you get!"}
{"text":"Three words, \"Sea Salt Caramel\". Go and you'll understand... Think about it, those three words alone were worth the five stars..."}
{"text":"Bomb! That's all i gotta say. There's no way you won't find something you won't like. The girl that was helping us was so sweet so cute was helpful helping us to find something we might like. I ordered the tiramisu shake honestly didn't think i was going to like it. And it was sooo good."}
{"text":"I like it! The sweetest girls were working behind the counter and I felt well received and appreciated. Greeted and Farewelled!   It's not exactly like Rita's Italian Ice but it's still pretty tasty. I do think they have more flavors to choose from than Rita's as well. I felt the texture of CJ's is thicker and more of a soft popsicle consistency. Plus ample seating inside as well as outside tables w/ umbrellas. They have a great $1 off Gelati coupon that is found in the mailers. I think I will be back more often to try the rest of the flavors.   Right now till the 4th of July you can get an All American Gelati for $2!!! Bring your coupon and get it for $1! Best Deal Around!!"}
{"text":"First time here. I'm pretty happy with the flavor and consistency of the custard, as I pretty much consider   Luv It's the standard. I got a custard cannoli, and didn't realize the size. It's easily shareable. We used our 10% off check in deal as well. This was an all around good dessert stop. We'll go again."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert after some Pan-Asian. I've had frozen custard before and loved it. I'm not sure at all how it's different from ice cream / gelato but whatever, me likey. Here, it was OK. I've had it at a place that it was so creamy and delicious. CJ's wasn't bad, but it wasn't mouthwatering. i really didn't care for the chocolate dipped cone with sprinkles on it. It tasted like it was made weeks ago. The chocolate had a stale, weird taste to it. The service was OK. They let you try stuff and that's cool. What is really weird is that they can \"make\" all these flavors. I guess they use a \"base\" ice cream/custard or whatever and then add flavor. Ew. That sounds nasty. I tried the mint chip italian ice. It was OK. It's italian ice and gelato mixed together, so they say. I guess after a fantastic meal at Pan Asian, and a prior experience with frozen custard, I wasn't blow away; I was underwhelmed. I'll stick with my frozen yogurt!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic custard or Italian Ice, CJ's is the best place in Las Vegas!  It's old school approach to customer service is refreshing, the owner has been there every time we've been in.  Always clean, never a long wait, exceptional customer service.  A \"Fargo's Favorite!\""}
{"text":"I won't even pretend to know the first thing about Italian ice. I don't really know much about custard, to be honest. All I know is this place has some tasty products that are perfect for cooling off during a hundred degree day.  If you're not familiar with their offerings, it might take you a minute to figure out what to get. Here's the lowdown...  They've got plenty of flavors of Italian ice in three sizes (small, regular, large). My kid got a chocolate Italian ice that had a lighter and more \"icey\" texture than sorbet. The small size was plenty for him. He barely made a dent in it and took the rest home.  They have chocolate and vanilla custard and you can add different flavors to them for $0.65. The piña colada flavor is excellent.  Also available are Concretes -- vanilla or chocolate custard with items that you can mix-in. I opted for the vanilla and cheesecake bits. A regular size was $4.25. They mix it similar to a Blizzard at DQ to make a smooth and creamy product.  Their final option is a gelati. You select your size (regular or large), an ice flavor, and vanilla or chocolate custard to create a layered cup of deliciousness.  The service was friendly and informative. They were glad to answer any questions and explain the menu. No doubt it's a family friendly place that I'm sure to visit plenty of times this summer."}
{"text":"Decisions, decisions! Lots of flavors to choose from. Everytime after we're going to a Filipino grocery, me and my dad always went here since Rita's ice custard is kinda far from out place and I heard they already have Frozen Milk tea. Ooh I love milk teas but i need to try the Frozen one too. I had the Green Tea with vanilla custard and Boba. It's yummy but the boba is a bit hard. should cook it more next time, I'll be back and try their \"WTF?\" Flavor."}
{"text":"Holy moly I sure have been missing out! This place is unreal!! Can't wait to go back!! Saw the Thai tea boba shaved Italian ice with custard on instagram so I went there to get it and let me tell you I was in heaven!!"}
{"text":"I stopped to try the custard and it did not disappoint.  It was thick, rich, and creamy for the vanilla chocolate swirl.  A little under $5 for a small cup and you can sit inside or out.  I'll need to stop by again and try the other flavors and an Italian ice."}
{"text":"CJ's takes me back to Jersey days with every bite.  The Italian ice really delivers flavor.  This may sound childish, but I'm attracted to any flavors that make my tongue change colors- captain america, the hulk, etc.  They taste awesome!  If you're not into that kind of stuff, the gelatis will also serve you justice!  The thick and smooth custard complement their ice so well!  Great treat at any time!"}
{"text":"Went to Recess day before so I can say I liked Recess custard better. It's taste less sweet than here which is good. It's bit too sweet here for me."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie we were gonna have tacos but instead we found this gorgeous place. I got the pineapple dole whip. Jesus that was good!! It's not even dairy too which makes people that are vegan eaters. A couple of my friends saw a sign that said the Monster Challenge. I can't even describe it but I instantly wanted to try it. I wanna come back to this place again"}
{"text":"The place was clean, had a huge selection of Italian ice, custard, and toppings. The best was the customer service. As soon as my family walks in we are greeted. I got the banana boat, it looked amazing and tasted just as good. I wish I would have found this place sooner."}
{"text":"We can agree to disagree, but as far as frozen custard goes in Vegas, Luv-It is still custard king(since 1973)...not Nielsen's, not Mr.D's(and Sheridan's before that), and most definitely not CJ's.  Customer service was pretty lacking, no service with a smile, and the girl who helped me behind the counter was VERY enthusiastic about selling CJ's to me...I'm kidding! You could actually hear a pin drop, thats how quiet it was as she waited for me with a blank stare to place my order. I just ordered a vanilla custard with heath toffee bits-pretty plane jane...  Just drive to the corner and get yourself some Thrifty's Ice Cream...better service too..ALOHA!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(300/365) \"Service Without a Smile...:(\""}
{"text":"Love this place favorite thing is the dole whip float. Taste just like Disneyland but better. I will be going back very soon"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the Italian Ice at all, and I grew up on REAL Italian Ice...  I haven't tried their custard, maybe that's what everyone goes there for... I might try them again, but that first time was rough. Really gross."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place. Finally i did ! It is located the way i am going to work.  I tried different flavors and it was so good.  I bought big case of pistachio custard ice cream the way came back home.  I will visit again soon"}
{"text":"I found myself referenced in another users review. The elements separately were great but the watermelon and twist combo wasn't the best. I made a rookie error but it was still  enjoyable. With all that said I'm still looking forward to going back and getting a Concrete."}
{"text":"Two favs here are the blue raspberry and cherry Italian ice, and the root beer with vanilla custard gelati."}
{"text":"Soooo good!!  I had the Tangerine Ice with the Vanilla Custard.  SHEESH... kinda like a Creamscicle."}
{"text":"Got to beat this desert heat with some frozen treats! Lol what better way to do it with some CJ's Italian Ice & Custard.   Located right across the street from Desert Breeze Park. This small shop delivers big flavors all across the board. Ranging from regular vanilla ice cream all the way too sour patch kids flavored Italian ice hell even Ice cream topped with French toast! I first walked in and was a little over whelmed by their selection of things to choose from. But luckily my friend and I already knew what we were getting and that was the spicy sandia. We'll get into detail about the spicy sandia later first I wanna talk about the inside of CJ's. The inside is quite small and can be packed quickly since it's a pretty popular spot on this side of town. Also the line can be pretty confusing as well it was hard to tell who was next in line . I didn't mind though since the vibes in the room were good, very friendly customers and staff . Welp let's yelp about what I ate here shall we?   Well the spicy sandia taste just as good as it looks ! Most definitely a show stopper and will probably get you a ton of likes on instagram lol. Layered with pineapple, watermelon, and mango custards and chamoy to separate each flavor. Topped with a watermelon,strawberry, Mexican candy,and tajin. All  for a very reasonable price! Actually it was really cheap I wish I knew the exact price but I forget.  You guys should definitely check this place out I do recommend GO GO GO!!!"}
{"text":"The Italian Ice with the Custard is quite delicious. They have many flavors of Italian ice to pick from. From rich chocolate to fruity flavors, you name it. I ordered a medium and couldn't finish it. It is quite filling. They also have tons of different, interesting flavors in to-go containers, if you want to take some home!"}
{"text":"My first time there and so many flavors to choose from. Black cherry gelati! So good! What to try next?"}
{"text":"First Time I went to cjs and tried a gelati absolutely fell in love with the soft serve and it was excellent, will be coming back to this place more often, their super nice and I will tell my hair clientele about you guys."}
{"text":"Love this place! So many flavors to choose from n the custard hits the spot perfectly! The whole family enjoys it every time we come here."}
{"text":"Family favorite --- I love it! Either get the Captian America with Vanilla custard or the Tangerine with Vanilla custard. ALWAYS friendly service and a punch card so you get a free ice after so many visits. Glad they are in Vegas.. its so hot here we need CJS! :)"}
{"text":"I love it! I got a creamy custard and it was the best snack I got! They give us free samples and the stuff is very cheep! I love it so much!"}
{"text":"We came in for Italian ice after a soccer game!! It was great and the people were nice. Limited seating together."}
{"text":"Just had another great trip to CJ's with the Family! The Pistachio Custard was incredible and the staff as always Amazing. They gave our 2 year old another ice cream when he dropped his cone."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to try CJ's!!!   I've still only had their custard, as they have italain ice selections available, and it is thick, creamy, and delicious!   They have lots of toppings and dipped cones to choose from   I took home a package of ice cream sandwiches and ate one each day that followed...so good"}
{"text":"It's 9 PM and it's 92 degrees out and I'm on my way home from a show.  What to do?  Well, a left turn off Spring Mountain Road and then a quick right into CJ's lot and I had solved the problem of cooling off.  I had read the Yelp reviews and I decided to give the place a try.  So many choices.  I found out that all the flavors of custard are made by flavoring vanilla custard with what you choose.  I opted for black raspberry.  It turned out that was one of the flavors \"on tap\" last night.  I went with that.  She asked me if I wanted any toppings.  I asked if they had any fruit.  She checked the cooler and showed me a container of fresh black raspberries.  That was fine with me so she added several raspberries to finish off the delight.  I sat inside although it would have been pleasant outside.  I just didn't want to spend time listening to some overly active and loud children while I enjoyed my custard.  The custard was great!  Now that I know how the gelati, concrete, and custards are made, I'll be stopping in again.  What a great place to stop when I'm coming back from a play in Chinatown."}
{"text":"YASSSSSS! The beautiful Lexi hooked it up with this awesome ice cream bowl-made with love!!! This place to rocks, way yummier than expected. If you're a custard lover it's a must. (They also have mango chamoy Italian ice that I'll be getting next time)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good! And this is considering the fact that I'm comparing it to Rita's... I absolutely love Rita's.  The flavors are not artificial tasting, and the custard is delicious.  Try the pumpkin custard!  Ample parking in lot (located in small strip mall).  You will notice that they have a truck that you can have for special events, fundraisers, etc.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The chocolate custard is amazing, though I didn't enjoy the Italian Ice nearly as much.  On my first visit the employees were very helpful in explaining the menu. We tried several samples of the Italian Ice. It has an interesting taste and texture, just isn't for me. The person I was with preferred the Ice to the custard. A large cup is about $5. Check Yelp deals for discounts, it can save you half. Coupon or not, the custard is rich, creamy and well worth the price. Beats any yogurt or ice cream in town! It should come with a surgeon general warning \"May be habit forming.\" (I've been there 3 times now.)"}
{"text":"Now I never can say no to custard. This custard was very good but nothing about the added ingrediants stood out. The concrete was still delicious and recommended. I'll be back to try the Italian Ice another time. Since I love custard this place will do since I live close by but if I had the choice I would still go to my favorite place in Henderson/Green Valley."}
{"text":"Cj's Custard never fails to treat one's taste buds. Every time I have gone into CJ's the workers are friendly and very helpful. They can give you just the perfect combination to satisfy your sweet tooth! Overall great place, and an even better summer treat!"}
{"text":"This place is very neat. My daughter wanted some awesome custard and I thought we would try this place out. I can not find anything negative about the experience the custard was awesome I got the cookies and vanilla custard and it was superb."}
{"text":"Continuous customer of this place, and I'm satisfied every single time. The root beer Italian ice with vanilla custard is to die for. Do your thing Jon. You're gettin it right my man."}
{"text":"Lots of flavors and toppings to choose from but by far the Best pistachio custard in town! Tried it for the first time and came back the next day for more. Coming back for a tub! Love the girls working there! Great customer service as well!"}
{"text":"Something different!  So I had seen a truck driving around town that had CJ custard on it and wasn't really sure what I was looking at. So I did some yelping slash googling around and found the store.  So I've tried yoghurt, ice cream and slushie kinda drinks and snacks, so frozen custard was a nice little change.  I grabbed a chocolate custard and lime ice for my first go around, as was the recommendation from the gentleman working there. Hey guess what it was tasty as hell!!!  I for sure will becoming back here, service was great with a nice product. They also cater which maybe something that will be in my future"}
{"text":"I have been to many custard places but, with the addition of Italian ice which I am  a fan of, I gave it 4 stars. The custard is probably the best I've had. It's smooth and creamy with just enough mouth watering taste. The ice on the other hand is fluffed with goodness and taste but is a bit too sweet. A regular gelati is under 4 bucks which is reasonable, and the size is worth what you pay for. Since I've been coming here for the last 4 months there has been numerous changes in staff ... Maybe it doesn't matter but what does it say for employee satisfaction. The place is not always too packed  and we like eating outside anyway .I'm just here to help make this place known so everyone can enjoy  what we experience."}
{"text":"Omg so good! No words you have to go so amazing. Great customer service! Now I crave this place everyday and my kids love it too! Don't miss out on this place it's like heaven. Literally you walk in and hear harps haha. I love Italian ice and this is REAL Italian ice so so so so so so good."}
{"text":"Cool people; I finally made my first time visit around to CJ's. Huge menu and reasonable prices. I eventually decided and choose to order a frozen clustered. Caramel syrup, marshmallow topping, & walnuts on a vanilla custard Cannoli. The pastry fulfilled its expectations. The inside of the parlor was clean and acceptable.The workers seemed joyful and up to beat. To be a new experience, I enjoyed my luck."}
{"text":"So many flavors! I went with my grandparents, and they both liked what they got. I personally got the chamango and it was great! Mango italian ice with plenty of Chamoy and toppings! Would probably return to try some more of their interesting flavors."}
{"text":"Solid four star dessert place! However, do not make the mistakes I did!  I went here because I like Rita's iron the east coast, and they're basically the exact same place. I got gelati's at Rita's which is basically Italian ice sandwiched by what they call \"custard\" which is basically a very rich delicious soft serve.   When going to CJs, I was hoping for the same delicious custard, and man did they deliver! However, I got a gelati, and the Italian ice was good but not great.   My girlfriend did the right thing... She got what they call a \"concrete\" which is just custard and you can mix things in, basically an upgraded McFlurry! She got vanilla with caramel and Oreo pieces mixed in... And it was to die for!  Also they have pints in the refrigerator with UNBELIEVABLE flavors! At between like 6-8 dollars for the pint (or was it quart?), it actually would have made more sense for us to get the unbelievable flavored custards and just split it. That's what we will do in the future :)"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  The ice and custard is such a tasty combo!  So tasty that as I was eating my tangerine ice and vanilla custard, I was already thinking of what flavors I'm going to get on my next visit.  Definitely going back!  Have to... need to fill up my stamp card."}
{"text":"Found this place because of foodie festival I went to in my area. I like how the Italian ice actually tastes like what it is supposed too. The frozen custards are really good tastes like a thick ice cream. My favorite is the Italian ice because since there is no dairy in it doesn't activate my slightly lactose intolerant tummy. They have some interesting flavors . good customer service which is important."}
{"text":"Though the ice and custard are good.  The service stinks.  The employees are not at all grateful to have a job.  They also have this \"wonderful\" loyalty card.  It is not so wonderful.  The card states \"Buy 5 Regular or Large Items Get a Regular Item FREE!!\"  However, If you are in for your free item apparently they consider the \"Regular item\" to be only an italian ice.  Yet on their menu \"Regular\" is a size not a product type.  When I asked the employees they informed me no regular is the ice.  When I posted on face book requesting a clarification it appears that my post was deleted and not answered.  I would go into the store once a week.  The first few times I went in there was no problem with getting a free gelati once I filled my quota on the loyalty card.  Now when all we get is gelati's the only thing free that I am allowed to get is an ice.   If this is the case then the loyalty card needs to be reworded.  Or the employees need to be better informed."}
{"text":"I have never tried a gelati, but it was a wonderful experience thanks to the friendly staff and prices.  I had banana italian ice and chocolate frozen custard. The frozen custard was something I've never had before, I guess it's like eating really thick pudding? A regular for $3 is great, because the serving is too much for me to finish I would be more than happy to pay less for a smaller size!  What I loved was that when I entered I was greeted with a smile. I mentioned it's my first time entering the place, and I'm not usually the type to ask for samples but our server gave me on anyways to confirm that I would be happy with my order. I'm very happy with the staff!"}
{"text":"A great find!  It's close by so I decided to go with my bf to check the place out. I had a difficult time deciding what to get since there were so many choices. Italian ice, gelati, concrete, custards, malts and milkshakes, pretzels, etc! And they have a large variety of flavors. I went ahead and got myself a gelati (mango ice + vanilla custard) and he got a banana custard (weird, I know). The custard was so creamy and silky smooth. I was glad that the Italian ice actually tasted like the flavor that it says it was cuz it may easily become too sugary and artificial tasting - but it wasn't, so that's good.   *been here a couple more times after  And I'll admit that some of their Italian ice flavors can be a little disappointing, but 8/10 of the flavors I've taste-tested were spot on so not a total fail. I have not yet tried their other menu items so I'll definitely try them next time I pay a visit."}
{"text":"We recently had CJs delivered for a party and it was fantastic. The Italian ice and custards we got were all delicious. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ducked in here for a little cooling off. Glad she gave me a few tasters before I jumped in with the Yelp deal. Wow this stuff is so sweet! And I mean waaaay too sweet. The Italian ice is like frozen sugar water with serious amounts of chemical food coloring. This is nothing like the real Italian ice you can get back east, from an Italian deli. Figures... Vegas....  I left with nada. CJ's - chemicals and sugar - definitely a no-go for me."}
{"text":"Perfect treat for the family on a hot summer day!  I had the Mango Italian Ice with soft serve.  It's a huge portion so I got the kids size.  Taking a star away because I had to drive from the north side to get there."}
{"text":"I am a faithful Rita's customer, but I had a coupon for CJ's so I decided to give them a try.  I was disappointed.  One of the things I like about Rita's is that their slush flavors taste real and they incorporate real fruit into their slush. At CJ's, the flavors tasted very artificial in comparison. Secondly, I enjoy the icy texture of a slush, and CJ's slush has a weird creamy texture that turned me off. I didn't even finish it.  I doubt I will go back, but next time I would try the custard and steer clear of the slush."}
{"text":"awesome!  been coming here since it opened. prices are very good n the ice is the true italian ice. im not a fan of bits in the ice n they dont have any. gelati is also always good. cant get enough of this place, especially in the summer!"}
{"text":"CJ's custard is incredible! Very dense, smooth and super creamy without being too sweet. Serving temperature is critical to the success of this high quality product and CJ's custard was nothing short of perfect. This was my first visit but it certainly won't be my last."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the custard/Italian ice thing. But custard flavors and quality are fair. The best thing is the peanut butter brownie sundae, definitely a good way to spoil a diet..but so worth it. Otherwise this is a good place to get a cheap, cool treat during one of our brutal summers."}
{"text":"2 words: Taro(Ube) Bobaglati. Idk why I've never tried Cjs before but man oh man so yummy! I do however wish they had more options to chose from, I wanna say there was only about a dozen when we came in. Cool thing though is they also have pre packaged flavor such salted caramel, cookie dough, lemon, and get this: MOUNTAIN DEW. staff was also very friendly, will definitely be coming back for more flavors."}
{"text":"I found CJ's here on yelp and since I'm a custard fan and there was a yelp deal we decided to go!! So they had vanilla, chocolate, and banana ready to serve but you can choose any of their flavors and they'll make it for you! I opted for the amaretto with hot fudge, it was pretty good a nice subtle almon flavor maybe next time I'll get extra added. My hubb had banana and chocolate. He loved it but I did try the banana and it was overwhelmingly fake like banana Chapstick! As long as he was happy, yuck! The prices are awesome and the girl working was very friendly!!! I love the options a person could go mad choosing!! But that banana was horrible...."}
{"text":"Love love this place!!! Always friendly service and everything tastes amazing. My favorite is the gelati with mango sorbet topped with chamoy and tajin. My family and I can't stop coming back hehe. Definitely a must try=)"}
{"text":"My boss LOVES CJ's! She sends me to buy different flavors for her quite often and she has really enjoyed all of them. The best thing about CJs are the employees! They are so kind and wonderful! One time I came in with my boss's dogs after taking them to the vet and she gave them FREE doggy custard with dog treats! They were so excited. Another time I mentioned to John that my boss is pregnant and he gave me an adorable baby bib to give to her! They are always so generous and happy. Best customer service in Vegas"}
{"text":"I cannot stress enough that CJ's makes the BEST banana split ever! I love how creamy their custard is on its own and when paired with all that makes a banana split, it goes from creamy to dreamy!   It's not just the rich flavor that keeps me coming back here, its honestly their staff. They are so sweet and friendly, they remember your face and even your order if you're a regular. Plus the price ain't so bad either."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Italian ice, but I absolutely love custard! I love the texture, and it's the perfect dessert for a day spent at the park across the street.  I've had their custard in numerous flavors, but I especially loved when they had pumpkin in the fall. If you are into the Italian ice, feel free to ask for samples. They have plenty of flavors! I also find that the smaller sizes they offer are large enough.  The employees can be friendly, but sometimes the tables aren't wiped clean... Other than that, CJ's is a good choice to have a treat!"}
{"text":"I'm no expert in Italian Ice or frozen custard but I do know what I like and this place is awesome! Ordered the gelati which is layered custard and Itlalian Ice. Beware the \"regular\" size is pretty big. I had the peach custard with watermelon ice. Perfect combination! My gf had vanilla custard and pistachio ice.  They do rotate flavors. The second time we were there no watermelon! I had the vanilla custard and chocolate ice! Very good too!   The ice flavors here are very good. And the frozen custard is well custardy? It's not like ice cream or soft serve you can actually taste the difference. And tell me it's not custardy!  I should knock off a star  for having just one location! NOT!  Service is good and next time in Vegas we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Easily the best custard and Italian ice in Las Vegas!!! Great flavors, huge servings, and a punch card that is easy to redeem! However it is the staff that makes this place, truly special. All of the employees are extremely friendly, and they truly enjoy helping their customers, and take care to make sure your experience is perfect!!"}
{"text":"Love their lemon custard!! We were looking for lemon custard ice cream and decided to give this a try. Yummy, yummy, yummy!!"}
{"text":"Used to come here so often. Now I'm back on this side, I'm definitely going to try and make this a regular place . Came in today, and it wasn't so busy, I had one person ahead of me. But when the people ahead of me finished off their order, people started pouring in. Nonetheless, the worker worked under pressure and she did great ! She was nice and wasn't rude, I asked to taste test, and she was fine . I had the Thai tea bobalati today ! It was yummy. It's not overly sweet, and it has that Thai tea flavor. It's not strong but it's present, which I like. I've also tried taro and green tea, custards, etc. allllllll delicious. It's a go to, if you're into Italian Ice and custard !!! They also have tubs you can buy to take home ! It's a small joint, so usually I'll just take it to-go. Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS! Great price and quality! My girl and I always passed by this place and we finally decided to give it a try and CJ's did not let us down! We got the Ube italian ice with chocolate custard and it was bomb! They also have a wide variety of italian ice for sale in separate tubs!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! Overwhelming amount of options but would recommend the Bobalati with Ube and the Chamango. Our 5 year old daughter loved the Sour Patch Kids Italian ice but it's definitely for a kid's palate - super sweet. We can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are addicted to this place! The custard/ice ream is amazing and the Italian ice flavors are so good! So much better than the other Italian ice joints in town!"}
{"text":"The vanilla custard is delicious. They have a wide variety of take out containers with Italian ice and custard flavors. I got the \"concrete\" which is custard with a mixture of toppings of your choice. Good place for kids and easy access off of Durango."}
{"text":"The bobalati was really unique and delicious! The flavors are also really cool. This place is great and I will definitively come back again to try more flavors!"}
{"text":"Cherry ice with Vanilla custard is amazing!!!  A must try!  All the workers are extrememly nice and helpful.  Especially Bailey.  I also met the owner once. He is very kind!"}
{"text":"Great little frozen treat place. We love Italian ice and the gelato combines that with custard to add some creaminess. The workers are always sweet and patient as the kids want to sample multiple flavors before settling on one. If they have the hazelnut custard when you visit, try it! It's yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here last week me and the BF craving custard and Italian Ice. The location is nice and convenient, service was great everyone was nice, but the Italian Ice was way too sweet and same with the custard we had only a couple bites and threw it out. Kind of waste of money. I wanted to enjoy it : /"}
{"text":"Great spot if you're trying to escape the Vegas heat and cool off with something nice and cold. I ordered the \"dole soft serve\" and thought it was a little too sour compared to he stuff they serve at the \"Magical Kingdom\". Overall, I still enjoyed it and it was very tasty to say the least.     The other people I came with had the \"bobalatte\" which I thought was interesting which is one of the main reasons why we came. It gave a pleasant taste of accuracy based on the claimed flavor, for example--the \"ube\" flavored really tasted like ube. The boba was chewy and tasted fresh.     Overall, the space was a little small with the amount of people who came in and out. It seems pretty popular for locals and they seem to enjoy the overall experience. I would be open to come here again and try other flavors."}
{"text":"I love this place since my cousin @Tanya P has since taken me and my boys there!  They give you discount if you check in and they recognize the military for their service! They are also always consistent with the customer service!  We have referred so many of our friends since being there because the ice cream is soo YUMMMY!!!  I need to see them for a fundraiser...who doesn't love ice cream?!"}
{"text":"Best custard ever...! Ordered the vanilla custard and it blew my mind.  So creamy, buttery rich, and smooth. I felt like I was eating something that was unreal and probably super fattening haha. Next time I'm in vegas,  I'm definitely gonna come back and try out more stuff.  Their menu is huge, while I was enjoying my custard I saw somebody get a custard float with orange soda...soo awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I like the different serving suggestions.  I would like more ice options available at any given time but I understand the reasoning for having a set daily menu.  Staff has always been friendly and efficient.  Yummy stuff!"}
{"text":"The brownie sundae is amazing. A warm brownie, 3 scoops of ice cream and marshmallow sauce, peanut butter sauce and hot fudge (it also comes with whipped cream, but I'm not a fan of that). Oh. My. It's amazing. Rich, delicious, chocolatey. Definitely a once-in-a-while, special occasion sort of treat. But oh, it's good. I've also tried some of their Italian ice- I think it was called Captain America? It was red, white and blue. That was also quite delicious, if you're going for something fruity and not as rich. Can't wait to go back and try some other flavors."}
{"text":"So many decisions!!! So so good! We picked up a pint of the mango gelati and turtle custard at Glaziers and had to check this place out for ourselves! I loved my sour apple gelati and my hubby loved his plain vanilla custard in a waffle bowl! The girl working was extremely helpful and gave us yummy samples to try! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The Thai tea bobalati is delish! Perfect mixture of gelato, boba & Italian custard. I tried all the other flavors as samples and I really like the Thai tea the best."}
{"text":"A huge variety of flavors for Italian ice, amazing/unique combos too! I got a boba Italian ice with vanilla custard on top. I've never seen anyone else do this, and it was AWESOME. My fiance got a classic twist on a pretzel cone and he said it was delicious."}
{"text":"Since its started warming up, I decided to try this place in hoped that it may be my summer go to spot ... and it will be. One, the service was amazing, I wish I could remember their names. They greeted me, I explained how I've never been their and they walked me through the flavors and what was popular. They didn't rush me and were very genuinely nice. Once I looked around a bit, I ended up getting a regular gelati, mango italian ice and vanilla custard, it tasted like orange sherbet when mixed together and was really good. Everything was perfect, the ice and custard were nice and fluffy but in a good way. Also a regular is more than enough for one person, its a pretty good amount I think. Overall, I think I found my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"This was a very interesting place.  I liked the flavors and the way they make flavors but even though it was creamy and yummy, the flavor was definitely lacking.  It was very very light and needed more flavoring to the custard.  The italian ice was good but my first thought was that it was going to be more like shaved ice instead of more of a solid texture.  I only tasted it, my niece ordered the italian ice and the flavor was good though.    I would definitely go back and just ask for more flavoring added, and I liked their stamp card.   The place was clean and very busy and that's always a great thing."}
{"text":"I love CJ's Italian Ice.  Great sugary goodness in so many flavors! The service is fast and friendly and they have a \"stamp\" card that rewards regular customers.  Regular specials and on Fridays you get to spin a prize wheel with the purchase of a large ice or custard.  My 3 y/o daughter loves to draw on the walls with the dry erase markers.  A fun place to take the family for dessert."}
{"text":"First time trying after i saw it on Facebook as an AD. I live in Henderson and it was sort of a bummer to see it all the way in summerlin. But that didn't stop my hubby and i! We went on a late Saturday and the line was LONG but it was surprisingly fast! I got the ube bobalati with a vanilla custard on top! I definitely recommend this place to anyone who LOVES ice cream like me and on top of that with some BOBA!! My favorite place for ice cream now!"}
{"text":"Just recently stopped in and now I am completely hooked! They have an awesome quality and assortment and even have sugar and dairy free options! They have punch cards so you get a free product after you buy a certain amount. This is our new after school and summer place to go. Just a bonus that it is just down the street from our house."}
{"text":"People were very nice and helpful, as for the custard and ice, custard was good, the ice I was not impressed with. I am a religious ritas custard and Italian ice fanatic, but wanted to try something different. I almost always get cotton candy and was expecting cjs to be as good if not better than ritas... unfortunately I was let down, the flavor was hardly there it almost was like just eating regular ice, sticking to ritas..."}
{"text":"CJ's Italian Ice and Custard is the best ice cream place! The staff are friendly and welcoming, and always willing to help. The owner himself is personable and awesome to talk to. Now for their custard and ice, they have everything you could ever want from the concretes to the Gelatis, with Cotton Candy being the best. They have new flavors of both custard and ice all the time, and allow you to try them. I personally go every other day because i love it so much. The atmosphere is fun and light, with a tinge of the old fashion parlor with a bar and stools along the window in the store . The walls are dry erase boards so you can write your comments and what new flavors you want to see. Over all the place is great for all ages, and I guarantee you'll be addicted on your first spoonful. Move over Cold Stone and Dairy Queen, there's a new guy in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent service from both of the young girls, which set the tone.  The salted caramel custard was delicious! I also tried the chocolate and black cherry Italian ice, which was better than anything I've had at Rita's!"}
{"text":"Ordered a vanilla custard with sea salt caramel concrete and large italian ice. The concrete had too much topping mixed in with very little custard, was not a fan. The custard itself was good but i would not order a concrete. It was very heavy. I did enjoy the italian ices. I would recommend sticking to the basics of plain custard or italian ices."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and decided to finally try this place out. (I usually opt for Thrifty's ice cream across the street)  It was a hot day so Italian ice was a good refreshing choice.  I got the red/white/blue flavor...don't remember the name but it reminds me of those Firecracker popsicles...yeah you know what I'm talking about.    They also have concretes...which to me seem like McFlurry's...just a bunch of toppings you can mix into a thicker custard and eat with a spoon.  You can also get a root beer/Coke float made with their custard.   Indoor and outdoor seating.  It's nice to sit outside if it's not too hot and if the umbrellas are up.  This place is okay.  Not somewhere I would go out of my way to eat at.  But it is a nice treat on a hot day!  (make sure you check out Thrifty's across the street...$1.79? for a scoop of unique ice cream!!!)"}
{"text":"Excellent service from Sydney and Baylee! All three items were made perfectly and enjoyed! Thank you again"}
{"text":"Great service, long line but the girl was fast and took care of everyone. This place is clean. The girl was friendly.  The watermelon ice was amazing with custard with it."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The custard was delicious and the Gelati was to die for! The only thing that sucked was the customer service. You can tell it was a slow day and the two workers didn't want to be there. They offered the customers behind us a punch card, but they didn't ask us. Super rude!"}
{"text":"Gelati is my favorite. Italian ice was very good but custard was kind a bland."}
{"text":"Items Ordered: Samples:  Captain America, Black Cherry, Lemon Italian Ice Salted Caramel Custard with Sea Salt Caramel Truffles Chocolate Cake - Chocolate Custard, Dark Flakes, White Icing, Chocolate Sauce  Passed countless times by those unaware - no glitz, glamour or Public Relations team to sell the concept - CJ's Italian Ice and Custard has nonetheless made a name for itself throughout the years by providing frozen treats to in-the-know Westsiders, and although offered at several local outlets including Glazier's Food Market the smart money seems to be going straight to the source for more than fifty flavors of Ice and Custard.  Family owned and operated, a Midwestern upbringing and education at The Ohio State University imparting Jon Goldberg with a familiarity of both styles of frozen treats, CJ's Italian Ice and Custard inhabits a small storefront attached to a Taco shop at 3555 South Durango Drive and with three-to-four varieties of the latter served via soft-serve machines plus a dozen blends of milk, water, eggs, sugar and flavorings offered via scoop from the freezer case the only question is how best to mix them, or whether to taste them on their own.  Baking the waffle cones in house while also packing several to-go options including pints, dipped Bananas and frozen Custard cakes, a first visit to CJ's can admittedly be quit daunting given the sheer variety of offerings, but with a quick tasting of available flavors a decision becomes somewhat easier, the only menu-option unavailable during this visit being the rolled Waffle Cone \"Custard Cannoli.\"  No doubt excelling in customer service, the two young women professional and helpful beyond their years, it was with samples of the classic Lemon and Black Cherry Ice - plus the Bomb-Popesque \"Captain America\" - that an order was selected, the ices to wait for another time as the daily special of Salted Caramel Custard was far too compelling.  Making every flavor in-house, the slightly melted texture of Ice lighter than that of Gelato or Ice Cream, CJ's Custard sets high marks by way of a base that comes across far more creamy than that at Luv-It without out being quite as thick as those at Shake Shack, the flavors carried forth robustly by way of the high fat content while the addition of small Caramels dipped in Dark Chocolate were one of nearly four-dozen possible additions offered in a generous portion for just an extra $0.50.  A bit disappointed that the smallest take-out containers of Custard are far too much for a single serving, the small cups of ice more appropriate though really not as pertinent since more flavors are available in-house, part two of the order instead focused on a \"large slice\" of Chocolate Cake, $5.50 netting a soft cocoa base topped in Custard blended with Icing, the texture almost like that of a Semifreddo with the top further coated in Chocolate Sauce and shaved Chocolate flakes.  ****Limiting themselves by not offering more Custards-to-go at a reasonable price, and inexplicably sold out of a menu item just past 1pm, CJ's Italian Ice and Custard nonetheless represents an under-discussed family-owned business worthy of Las Vegas' patronage, the friendly service and good prices well-matched to options varied enough to suit any taste."}
{"text":"Went to the park and saw CJ'a across the street. What a convenient location to be at. Several flavors of Italian ice to chose from but out of the 4-5 I tried I only liked 1. Their custard was so sweet! If I had to chose, I would go to Rita's vs here but again we were at the park so it was convenient."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night with my family (6) and met up with 2. I got the yelp 5 for 10 deal. I ordered the mango, passion apple, and watermelon + custard.  - Compared to great italian ice and custard in socal (Frostbite and Joe's Italian Ice), the taste is not as good. BUT!!! with the YELP deal, it just makes it sooo much better! CHEAP! :) - I usually get mango + passion fruit. They didn't have passion fruit but passion apple. lol - Don't get watermelon. It tastes like a laffy taffy!!! :( - Weird fluffy mess at the bottom... :( - Great place to hang out! Very friendly service. :) - Already filled up the stamp card in 1 night (5 stamps)! SCORE :)"}
{"text":"The Italian ice and custards are delicious. My favorite is the custards simply because it taste like heaven in a cup. Just imagine the custards being like ice cream and served the same way if you were to get it out of the ice cream machine. However, instead of having the soft consistency of ice cream, the custards will be slightly thicker and richer. The custards here are extremely creamy with an aftertaste of the eggs they use to make it.. add the various flavorings and you have buttery goodness of all sorts (best way to describe it is like eating chilled butter in a cup.. that's how deliciously rich it is)   Everyone has a favorite flavor so I'm not going to go into details on how each specific one taste. CJ's has over 30 different flavors and combinations you can mix and match from but I find that the standard vanilla and chocolate taste the best. You can watch them make it when you order and you'll notice that they actually use the vanilla custard as a base to add flavorings and mix to get your desired flavor. The standard custard  flavors itself is well balanced when it comes to sweetness, but in my opinion, the more uncommon flavors such as apple pie, etc is overly sweet and bluntly generic tasting. So keep that in mind when you order unusual flavors.. Just because they have it listed on the menu doesn't always mean it should be made... IMO, strawberry is the best one they have."}
{"text":"Wide variety of ices and custards! Sea salt caramel custard is recommended! Strawberry ice was also tasty. They have counter service but also have quarts and pints to go with a wide selection. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a couple times. The custard and Italian ice is sooo good and the staff is super sweet. They closed at 10 and we rolled up around 10:15 and they still let us order and had a great attitude about it. This has become our go-to dessert spot. CJs is awesome!"}
{"text":"I love this place for their custards mainly. Love the flavors and options. Italian ice is very sweet. Always super friendly."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the frozen custard I had the regular  cup with vanilla and banana mix. It was very creamy and smooth texture. No complaints from me it was just what I was looking for after dining at Pan Asian few blocks up. I thought the price was good also $3.75 for the regular cup. Way enough for me"}
{"text":"Mango my favorite flavor.  Today, I saw strawberry with chocolate and was tempted to try it with chocolate custard.  But since they had mango, I went with it.    I enjoy this cold sweet treat and am wondering how the winter is going to affect my desire for this wonderful treat."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness!!!!! This place is amazing!! We came here because we saw a video of it on Facebook... and let me tell you,  we were not disappointed! We tried a bunch of different flavors and it was hard to choose which one to go with! I'm pretty bummed that this is their only location. The girl that helped us was so friendly! Didn't catch her name but I wish I could acknowledge her. I went with the honeydew and watermelon with boba and vanilla custard. My cousin got the honeydew and ube with boba and vanilla custard. Omg!!!!! Please open a location in the Bay Area!!!!"}
{"text":"Great if you are craving some sweets and love family owned places!  My best friend introduced me to this place and I love it. The owner was running the show and was super sweet and friendly. Had a good conversation with us while we sat there and ate our ice cream.   The ice cream is great and they have two main types. The custard ice cream being my favorite because it qualms my sweet tooth and there are a load of toppings you can add on!  It's not the best place, the Marble Slab still being my hands down favorite, but it is in a much better location, still great, and I love places where you can get to know the wonderful people who own it.   Must go!"}
{"text":"It's was really good. Love their tamarind ice and ube but for the price I give it a .  Customer service was good."}
{"text":"Saw this place driving by so decided to check it out. Place is colorful and clean and the staff was friendly despite it being pretty slow due to weather. Got a gelati based on recommendation and it was awesome big portion and very good price. Will be back for sure but may wait till it's a little warmer!"}
{"text":"Gah! I crave the brownie sundae everyday since I tried this place! The custard is really good- so creamy! The ice is pretty good too, but I have nothing to base it off of- and some of the flavors I have tried haven't been that great. But anyways, the custard is really good, and so is the ice (if you find a flavor you like). They have a ton of flavors you can get for your custard- what they do is use the vanilla base, and mix in some flavor. My favorite is the coconut custard, on top of the hot brownie sundae! AH! SO GOOD! The brownie sundae consists of: one hot brownie (frozen, then microwaved) with three swirls of custard (depending on the person you get, you can get three different flavors of custard) and each swirl is topped with their own sauce- peanut butter, marshmellow creme, and chocolate (you can change any of those to something else if you want) and finally whipped cream. This is by far my favorite thing here! I've tried three ices: coconut, cotton candy, and marshmellow creme- all were really good, but I advise that you try the flavor first before getting it, you might not like it (example, they have a Laffy Taffy Watermelon flavor that I thought I would like, tried it, and it does NOT taste like Laffy Taffy anything, or watermelon). My boyfriend gets the custard cannoli- it's a waffle cone in the shape of a cannoli shell, stuffed with custard, and topped with your choice of sauce and whipped cream. He was told that the only flavors of custard you could get with this is vanilla or chocolate, but they advertise one with blue custard...so I guess if you ask, and depending on the person you have there, you might be able to get a flavored custard. This place really does depend on the person you get to help you. Sometimes they make your item wrong, and sometimes they do not stamp your card, or even give you a card (hit five and you get a free item!) so that sucks."}
{"text":"Being from South Philly this is the closest thing to water ice I'm going to get and they have chocolate which is already better than Rita's! Anytime I want water ice I go to CJS. And the ladies working are always polite."}
{"text":"Although I'm not too into sweets, I've been wanting to give this place a try. Most of their flavors seemed really sweet, but I was able to try a few samples before deciding on one. I ordered a tangerine ice with a combination of vanilla and chocolate custard. I wasn't sure about how it would taste, but it actually turned out awesome, tasting very much like a creamsicle. The ice is very soft and evenly flavored, and it goes so well with the custard on top. Getting a combination of vanilla and chocolate was a great idea for two different mixtures with the tangerine. The place is clean, with outdoor seating, and staff very friendly. It's the perfect dessert on a hot summer day! Would definitely come back and try more flavors!"}
{"text":"Fruity Pebbles, vanilla custard & cherry Italian ice. Absolutely perfect summer treat! We also got the root beer float (root beer, vanilla custard & root beer ice), a carton of Lifesavers Italian ice & a carton of mint chip custard! The girls were nice, we had to ask a few questions, but overall a good experience! So excited to try more!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Ube ice cream/gelato and I will definitely be back for more. I was amazed at the amount of different flavors that were available and the prices seemed to be a little more reasonable then some of the competitors. Definitely a great place to get a treat after eating at one of the nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"Really good custard. Nice place."}
{"text":"The custard is incredibly addictive and creamy, just right on the sugar. I love the vanilla custard, thankfully is across town from where I live, otherwise I would be there every day."}
{"text":"SOOOO love this place!!!  The staff are always so nice!  The flavors are always amazing!  And their prices are great too.  Plus you get the CJ's stamp card and get free one after purchasing 5.  If you are lucky enough to be there on a day they have pineapple or watermelon, you gotta try them both!!!  FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"If you're not coming here for the ube Italian I've with vanilla custard and boba then something is wrong with you! It's so yummy.   I'm not giving it 5 stars because if I didn't know about boba and ube I would never know it existed here. The menu isn't very good at explaining much and I would love to see something that shows amazing combinations.   But if you're in the area give the boba and ube a try. It's great if you don't want to go all the way to china town area for your Asian dessert fix   They also have a punch card!"}
{"text":"My 2nd time here and i will come again. I came to redeem a free small ice that i got from them for giving my email address on my first visit. Then i loved the fact that there were new flavors than the last time. So on this deal i was able to get something for myself and for my kids. I am a fan! Better than the ice cream i was going to get at first."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I tried the chocolate custard. It's not amazing to me but it's still good. I tastes too much like butter. Only marking off a star due to dirty tables. It only takes a few seconds to clean, especially when there's no customers waiting to order."}
{"text":"Yummy Italian ice!"}
{"text":"Wow! O.M.G.!! The best soft serve type ice cream ever. I wish we had this in LA. The custard is smooth and velvety and oh so delicious! Try it!!!"}
{"text":"I am a current Cjs employee and I've had jobs in other custard places. Although those places weren't bad, I just love Cjs. The thing about CJ's is its all real and amazing! For gosh sakes, the ices are made right in the back of our store! As an employee I'm required to clean and keep the place clean and also treat every one of our guests with respect and a huge smile! We are required to keep everything fresh and yummy! And it is for sure! I am happy to work in a work environment where I absolutely love the product (I come in on my days off) and love the atmosphere. Go Cjs!!"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot in the hot and dry desert. I ordered the red, white, and blue Italian ice special for $2 -- if you're from OC, it resembles the Joe Latti from Joe's Italian Ice in Garden Grove, CA. While it was cool and refreshing, flavor-wise, it pretty much tasted like a more condensed version of a cherry or blueberry Slurpee.  We also ordered a concrete, in which you have you pick of flavor for the custard, then whatever toppings you wanted mixed in. There are additional charges for more toppings. We tried the vanilla to go along with peanut butter cups. I thought it tasted pretty good -- similar to a Blizzard from DQ.  The inside is small, so not much room to sit if there are already some hot and sweaty old (and young) people sitting. Nonetheless, with that current $5 for $10 Yelp deal going on right now, I say go get your frozen goodies and eat it in the car while the AC is on full blast."}
{"text":"Place never seems to amaze me just had them set a party pack for me in pretty much with no notice. They had it ready to go and it went over like a hit. Just goth oneself a new set of fan based customers to follow"}
{"text":"I was driving by with my wife and we decided to stop by and get some Italian Ice. We had never been to this place so the staff was extremely helpful in assisting us in placing an order. I figured I'd stick with something safe to see if it was spectacular or just ok. I ordered a root beer float and my wife ordered passion fruit and mango Italian Ice with no custard. While there we had to try the super hero name Ice and they were some great mixes I believe one of them was strawberry and coconut and I can't remember the rest.   The root beer float was ok it was just a plain root beer float nothing spectacular and the same can be said for the Italian ice. The one thing that I do suggest is placing a trash can outside for those who choose to sit in the day light while having there ice so that they may have somewhere to throw their trash away rather then having to go back into the establishment."}
{"text":"My son took me there on mothers day and they were very busy; I thought the watermelon with vanilla custard was very good, even better than the chocolate ice! Going back"}
{"text":"Really nice artsy blends. I love having desserts here."}
{"text":"I love this place. So many options sometimes I feel a little overwhelmed but I've never had a bad combination. Go see for yourself."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place, especially with all the positive reviews on here. Maybe I came on an off day?? Who knows.   I got the butterscotch custard and my husband got the kahlua custard. We both had them regular size on one of the chocolate/vanilla dipped cones. What a total disappointment. Both of ours just tasted like vanilla. Maybe we should have asked the girls to add more flavoring to them but we didn't want to be assholes and have them remake them. So not only was the custard less than pleasing, the chocolate/vanilla dipped part was just awful. I thought at least if the custard wasn't amazing I could at least enjoy the cone and boy was I wrong.   We both agreed we should have gone to mcdonalds next door to get their cones. Our custards were definitely not worth the $10 we spent.   I'm thinking we should have gone with the Italian ice instead? Seems like that's what a lot of people like here.   Don't see myself coming here again."}
{"text":"I love there Italian Ice.. picked up a couple for the 4th of july rain bow flavored and cherry flavored. ---Sooo good .. Italian Ice is worth a shot espic during heat !. I havent tried much else as of yet but I will try some next time and update but seriously the red white and blue italian ice crazy good -- do they have a orange flavored ice curious ?"}
{"text":"I love this place. The italian ice is so smooth and tasty. There are so many different flavors to try. My favorite is the custard. It's so creamy. I like spending a few minutes deciding which custard and italian ice combination to use for my gelati. They also have Quarts of gelati in the freezer with combinations already to help you out too. Overall a good summer treat for any age."}
{"text":"I returned last night with my Yelp Deals in hand and finally tried the Italian Ice. I sampled pistachio and chocolate and ultimately went with lemon. My fella and mom got pistachio and chocolate gelatis respectively. Definitely a fan, I'll be back for watermelon next time!"}
{"text":"I was craving ice cream and this place was on the way to my destination so decided I'd try something new rather than the McDonald's ice cream or dairy queen I usually buy when I'm craving ice cream. They have various selections ranging from custards to different flavored ice creams. I tried the concrete and added Heath bar as my topping. It was really good and they were not stingy with the Heath bar serving."}
