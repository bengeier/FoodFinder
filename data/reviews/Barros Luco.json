{"text":"Toujours aussi bon, bruyant et très étudiant, amis toujours aussi bon et différent des autres restos de Montréal."}
{"text":"This place has really improved and I really love their empanadas and burritos. Very kind owner who constantly updates the plates, decor, quality. My only complaint is that I'd like to see vegetarian burritos cooked fresh always. Sometimes the waiter goes into the kitchen and to ask \"Do we have any left?\" It makes me think much of the burrito is frozen/microwaved/sitting around. If the tastes were just a little fresher I think this place would be great! I would still recommend it!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this \"Chilean?\" Restaurant on my way to brunch elsewhere. I took a quick peak inside and was won over by their charm and long list of sandwiches. I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich and my mother had the classic 'barros Lucos'. The service was friendly and the sandwiches were delicious. A lot of people stopping by to grab a meal. I will definitely visit next time I'm in the area. Next time I will have a 'churro '!!"}
{"text":"What a great place!

I had their cheese empanada mmmm loved it! Their table sauce for the food... I wish they sold because it was delicious! Their churrasco sandwich even better! The family who owns it (the staff) were so great! 

Gracias por su amabilidad, hospitalidad y rica comida! Que pena que no estén mas cerca! Espero ir a Montreal otra vez muy pronto para visitar este gran lugar!"}
{"text":"Hummmmmm que hummmmmm"}
{"text":"The food is good the sandwiches could be way more authentic! The meat used on the sandwiches is not correct! Also a \"barros luco\" is made with only the steak and cheese! Not avocado and tomato! I hope they get better and just improve throughout."}
{"text":"We had some empendas (chicken), a Barros Luco sandiwch and a hot dog...My suggestion: skip the hot dog...I thought guacamole on a hot dog would be an awesome combination. It wasn't.

But the rest was pretty good.  Plus you get to see them make the sandwich  at the counter and all the food was piping hot. If you are in the area and need a cheap good meal, it's definitely an option."}
{"text":"First of, come with a debit card or cash, they don't accept credit cards.

Food is really average, the place is not super neat either... They have a lot of work to improve if they wanna compete with the places around here..."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimer ce petit resto sympa, juste en diagonale du Fairmount bagle,  il fait l'angle sur St Urbain avec sa terrasse extérieur et une qui a vu de l'intérieur sur Fairmount. Le petit sandwich Churrasco que j'ai mangé semble très simplet au premier regard mais délicieux au goût. J'ai vraiment aimé l'avocat qui se marie bien à la lanière de buf hum ^^ très bon et remplis plus l'estomac qu'il n'y parait. Mon ami avait prit l'assiette Lomo Saltado , délicieux tout autant. Belle découverte en une journée ensoleillée ... Regardant la vie urbaine s'activer de touriste et de vacancier ^^"}
{"text":"J'ai vécu tout près de cet endroit pendant plusieurs années et c'est toujours avec grand plaisir que j'y retourne dès que j'en ai la chance. Les propriétaires sont d'une gentillesse inouïe. La nourriture est simple mais bien exécutée et \"muy casera\". Le barros luco est un incontournable mais vous craquerez aussi pour les empanadas au fromage et au buf (mes préférés), la soupe aux lentilles, le poisson frit et j'en passe. N'oubliez pas de prendre un \"alfajor\" en fin de repas! C'est le millefeuille chilien avec le délicieux \"dulce de leche\" entre chaque couche de biscuit. Miam!"}
{"text":"The eponymous steak sandwich might be the best sandwich I've ever had.  Perfect contrast among hot sauce, avocado, steak, and cheese; the bread was fresh and the service fast."}
{"text":"A really great, friendly little Chilean place with great empanadas! I had the beef, but I can't wait to return and try others. They also have Alfajores (delicious cookies!). Really friendly owner and staff, reasonable prices and an all-around warm feeling when you go in. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick snack. We ordered a veggie sandwich each.  The veggies were fresh and the bread was good. The best part was the homemade hot sauce. Kind of reminds me sriracha and sambal mixed together.  Their brunch menu is limited but the churros look amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife is peruvian and although this isn't a peruvian restaurant, they have some nice foods and drinks from her childhood.  We came here the first time as we were getting bagels across the street and needed coffee.  The coffee is pretty good, and they have Inca Kola which isn't found too many places.  We tried a few empanadas and the cheese is easily the best. The chicken was better than the spinach.  

They have some tasty pastries as well. Worth checking out if in this area, its different than most places and the staff is trilingual."}
{"text":"It's ok, music is nice when the Peruvian artist is there... 
portions sizes can be more generous. 
They need to update their menu prices, was overcharged but went back and the lady was kind, a real darling ... credited th difference.
Food is average, but there is lots of potentIl for sure."}
{"text":"Great little place for a Barros Lucos, the bread is uniquely sweet and the fillings which include steak, avocado, and cheese is just perfect.  Among the other must try items are their caramel dessert (everything is made in house) or their special of the day like todays fried fish with rice.  The people who own it are super friendly and while it's a no fills whole in the wall, your sure to find something you will love."}
