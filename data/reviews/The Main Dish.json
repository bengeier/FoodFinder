{"text":"Trying the new Brunch menu today with the TMD Bridgeland Benny. They even offer it with the option of gluten free bread. It was Yummy. New menu has lots of the favorites plus a bunch of new dishes for me to try. Looking forward to my next brunch."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the breakfast at Main Dish, it is a common Sunday destination. breakfast is tasty and they have a good assortment of choices. The hash browns are awesome and the little smoothie shot is always a nice treat!   Also love the lattes and London Fogs.   I've never tried lunch or the takeaway food, but it looks delish."}
{"text":"The Main Dish in Bridgeland is an open concept market-style restaurant that's reminiscent of a Whole Foods or Sunterra Market.   They offer an enticing variety of chef-prepared meals to eat in or take away.  The evening I was there, they had ribs, chicken, mac n' cheese, fancy ravioli, as well as several ethnic and vegetarian options.  You can choose items from their food counter and heat it up at home, or you can select one of the daily hot dishes made starting at 5pm.  They also offer daily hot breakfast, and lunch options, as well as a sandwich and cappuccino bar.   So many options, so little time.   And if time is of the essence, and you want to eat gourmet food fast, the Main Dish is where it's at."}
{"text":"Bland,  overpriced food.  Only to be consumed if desperate. I'm not quite sure why people go here."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on a walk home one night, as it was recommended to us. The lady at the checkout was pleasant, but not really helpful. Was very underwhelmed by the burger that I had ordered. It lacked flavour in general and was not good. Haven't returned and don't think that I will any time soon."}
{"text":"I had the veggie omelette and it had no taste, the worst omelette I've ever had. Staff were not friendly and when I asked a question they argued with me and was rude. Will not go back because of the staff."}
{"text":"Great, healthy, flavorful food. The deli salads ate delicious and I've tried them all. The Thai Noodle salad and the broccoli salad are my favorite. A little pricey but you always feel good when you go there because you know you had a yummy and nutrient packed meal."}
{"text":"The lady at the till needs a lesson in customer service and just a little bit of a personality.   Eggs Benny by far the worst I have ever tried. How do you screw up scrabbled eggs....oh you don't cook them all the way  Caesar drink with the blanched green bean??? And franks red hot sauce really fracks is good but not in a caesar dill infused vodka please NO."}
{"text":"Good fresh breakfasts, found some of the workers a little snobby.   Breakfasts are your standard eggs, sausage and toast combinations but they are well made with good ingredients. A little bit more expensive than you might expect (around $12-15 per person).   Main DIsh's focus is on providing prepared meals to eat at home. For some reason, the prepared dishes cannot be eaten at the tables in the store. Only the smaller selection of freshly made items can be eaten there. Asked a couple of workers why this policy was in place and received a reply of \"that is how things are.\" Thanks, but not really that useful."}
{"text":"I'm often in Bridgeland on business or biking through so I've been introduced to Main Dish by a few friends.  Food's great, freshly made and there's usually plenty of seating. While most lunch choices are great, I've had their Italian Benny for breakfast a few times and it rivals the best i've had anywhere. Highly recommended.  On another note, I've had really great service as well. A number of times, the cook himself would come out with a hot plate and deliver it to our table. I had the chance to meet the owner and he's really passionate about this business and the idea of fresh food.  *PARKING TIP* - If you drive around back and towards the Bridgeland C Train station, that street has free parking for 2 hours. Also, if you drive across 1st ave into the residential area you can find free parking as well."}
{"text":"The Main Dish is the most versatile place in Calgary to eat. Want a light snack and beverage?! Done. Want a healthy lunch with a smoothie?! Done. Want coffee, tea, or latte?! Done. Want a nice dinner with a glass of wine?! Done. Looking for some refreshing entertainment on a Saturday night?! Done.  I can't stop talking about how wonderful this restaurant is. And to boot, they have the best veggie stir fry I have ever had (A vegetarian's dream!).   Also, this amazing place is looking to expand so that more people can enjoy their awesomeness. And they need your votes to help them receive funding on PODIUMs website. Go here and vote YES for The Main Dish www.podiumfunds.com"}
{"text":"This place has ok food, for Calgary. definitely not worth how much you pay. A very small lunch (very small portion of veggies and medium sized piece of tofu) cost me $10. I don't think lunch is possible for less than $10 here.   there is absolutely no reason to spend this much. the food is no better than you can get from the deli at any grocery store."}
{"text":"This restaurant is OK and the price of food is not bad. The food has always been really good! Their burgers are really tasty and they make a really excellent steak!  But if you decide to have a glass of wine be prepared to spend $9 on their basic house wine which I think is absolutely ridiculous! For this reason I rarely go to Main Dish and look elsewhere when wanting to dine out."}
{"text":"This Christmas, my family decided to forego making the big supper with all the trimmings.  Instead we decided to have our supper catered by The Main Dish.  Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with the quality and the quantity of the food.  The turkey was over cooked and dry, the gravy was extremely thin and watery, the cranberry sauce was thinned with what we believed to be rhubarb,  the brussel sprouts were swimming in black pepper (almost to the point of making them inedible), the stuffing was very bland, and the limited amount of mash potatoes we received did not contain any discernible amount of cheddar or garlic.  Despite ordering 15 meals, we did not receive 15 pieces of dessert.  The only item that everyone seemed to enjoy was the soup.  Although, a serving size of the soup had to be limited to a few ounces. If you are looking at catering your next family gathering, look somewhere else.  We would not recommend The Main Dish and will be looking elsewhere in the future.  Merry, Merry. . . . ."}
{"text":"Was at a Christmas party catered by them, service was mediocre as was the food. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Their menu sounds really good and I had high hopes for this place. It was quite windy the day we went and I had my dog with me so we decided to do take out instead of sitting on their patio as planned. We put in an order for the sweet potato hash and the Bridgeland benny and waited about 15 mins or so before our food came.  Looking at the food, it appeared appetizing. But once we dished up, everything was a bit lacklustre. There was no guac, sour cream or salsa accompanying the hash as mentioned - what did come was an egg shell, which was probably not supposed to be there. And another bonus was a hair in our hollandaise sauce for the eggs benny. Cool.   It was all pretty bland, and the after picking out the egg shell and hair, understandably our meal was a bit off putting.  Would I go back to Main Dish? Probably not. $18 for a brunch entree is pretty steep for the quality you get."}
{"text":"Anther nice find in Bridgeland!  I've done take away meals from here a few times and have always been satisfied. There are a variety of items to choose from, and the offerings are interesting and unique.  The ribs and sweet potato mash are fantastic and we can never seem to pass on the green beans.  I also recommend the carrot cake, it's unforgettable."}
{"text":"My gf and I moved to Bridgeland last week and yesterday we tried Main Dish. We wanted to pick something up to bring home because it was a busy night. We got coleslaw, 3 quarter chickens, mashed potatoes, and rice. The chicken was dry and one of the portions had very little meat on it. Also at $7.50 each they were overpriced IMO. The rice/squash combo was very bland and also dry. The coleslaw was too vinegary. The mashed potatoes were good except charging $5 for a little portion like that is unreasonable.    It's disappointing they advertise their meals as tasting 'home cooked' because that is not the case. It was about at par with the delis at Safeway, Co-op, etc. but more expensive.    The only plus was the service. The staff were friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"After reading previous reviews of how good the brunch was, a friend and I decided to check it out. I was disappointed though. I ordered an eggs benny with back bacon and white cheddar potato cake. The potatoes were  just roasted with some herbs, no cheese in sight and the back bacon on the egg Benedict was a small piece of deli meat that I couldn't see under the poached egg. I had one bite near the end where I actually tasted back bacon."}
{"text":"Don't pay when you order your food! The so called servers might give service if you wait to pay- this place is a glorified cafeteria which is over priced.  Basted eggs were hard not medium and they argued - over two eggs.  Sullen servers who obviously don't like even bringing your food.  Tasteless veggie omelette, over priced.  Go down the street to Dairy Lane for great food and service"}
{"text":"Ordered sandwiches through their catering and was very disappointed. Many of the sammies were soggy from the tomatoes (as in sopping wet). When I phoned the next day to complain, I was told they would discuss it with the catering crew and someone would get back to me.  Yeah, that never happened.  I spent over $200 for soggy bread."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food which was high quality. Had tofu and salads which were both fantastic. Would definitely come back again. Staff were friendly and helpful too."}
{"text":"Great food service was confusing for a first timer (help yourself) very busy"}
{"text":"2 for service, 3 for atmosphere, and 4 for variety of food. Thus, 3 stars overall.  Let's start off with the good. The concept is pretty cool. It's like a market, where you wander around and look at the different food, but its still a restaurant. The food is varied and the menu is interesting. I have had their broccoli salad and it was delicious. I have tried their west coast eggs benny as well, and it was alright. Not the best eggs benny by ANY means, despite what the other reviews say.   Service is not the best. You won't get any smiles or pleasantries here, at least I never have. Maybe because I am not a Lululemon-wearing, dog-walking soccer mom who lives in the area and shops and brunches all day. Food takes YEARS to arrive, but when it does, it's pretty good.  But it looks like I am the only one in town who expects a pleasant experience with friendly service when I go out for brunch because the place is always packed anyway."}
{"text":"Very over priced and is the same food day after day in their \"deli\".  Find the service to be lacking some of the time, either they ignore you until you force them to give service or it's very slow.  Would be good if they changed their menu once in a while."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, I would never have discovered this place if I didn't live on top of it. Now I live about a block away from it, and don't want to move much further from it! It is perfect, gourmet take out for a young professionals face paced lifestyle. Superbly decorated (love the concrete floor) with a rich atmosphere and amazing food to choose from (herb crusted mac and cheese :)  Staff is happy to greet you with a smile and help you out with all your questions. Sit in, or take out you... won't be disappointed.  One more reason I love my little Bridgleand."}
{"text":"The Main Dish used to be a passable alternative to nearby brunch standouts: Blue Star Diner, Diner Deluxe and OEB, etc. I think I'd rather persevere through OEB's wait times than endure The Main Dish again. Given the ghost town atmosphere during peak weekend brunch hours, it looks like I'm not the only one in Calgary who thinks so.   Once upon a time, the Main Dish was known for delicious and relatively healthy ready-made meals. They are a shadow of their former selves. The menu is now truncated and the service even more so. The ingredients are exceedingly pedestrian and the portions are mediocre. Frankly, I've eaten hospital food with more flavour.   I had the Florentine Benedict, described as wine and garlic braised kale (yum) but produced as undercooked weeds my four-year-old cousin would proudly produce in muddy hose water (not yum) and if the potato cheddar cake was supposed to be cooked, the ice cold center suggested otherwise.   The omelette had an odd spongy texture, resembling a kitchen sponge that's long overdue for disinfecting. Which... as a food item... is not so good, you know?  The Italian sandwich was so utterly forgettable that all I can remember was that it came with a single carrot stick and a single celery sliver.    Speaking of sad garnishes, another plate received half a GRAPE tomato. Half. A. Grape. Tomato. So many questions. Who has the other half? Why cut it? What led to the conscious decision to only plate half a grape tomato? How is there a vegetable shortage in a restaurant that promotes itself as healthy, fresh and delicious? My eyes searched longingly around the restaurant in hopes of reuniting the two halves but... there was no one else around.   If this is \"healthy\" eating then please super size me so I can have a whole (grape) tomato.   Pros: Absolutely positively no wait times; if you like dining with crickets, come here.   Cons: Everything feels and tastes like sadness"}
{"text":"Where do I start?! I AM IN LOVE with this place. The staff is always friendly and helpful and actually look like they want to be there. They are all a breath of fresh air!  The food. Wow. I enjoy cooking most nights (when time permits) at home but with our busy schedules, this place really saves the day! The variety is fit for everyone's taste or craving.   Thank you, thank you, thank you!!"}
{"text":"I think I have been to this restaurant/market about 101 times. I live right behind it for now - not in the alley (haha!) but in a cozy condo that matches this stunning neighbourhood. I love Bridgeland. Today I had an old friend come by and see me from out of province. I took her to Main Dish for lunch knowing that she would likely love it. I had seen before that they had a nice selection of wine and we were ready to try a glass! Being a foodie, this place draws me in all the time. They always have a good variety of fresh food to go behind the massive glass displays and it changes somewhat day to day. What a great place for single people or couples or anyone to drop into after work especially when the urge to cook is just not there. What I have ordered in the past to go has been pretty good. Staff, hit and miss, today they were pretty good and not all looking like they wished they were elsewhere. Now, this place is not cheap. We did not come here to save money but I wanted to see what the \"stay in and eat\" meals had to offer. It was lunchtime (late lunch) so we split a pasta alfredo, the pasta being penne. The pasta was cooked to perfection, to the tooth! The alfredo sauce was to die for as were the big chunks of mushrooms and fresh chicken breast. The staff agreed to split the meals for us on 2 plates and the \"75\" wine we ordered was very tasty. I wish bread had come with the pasta plate but, no.  I got a couple of items to go including my husband's favourite lemon dessert bar from there and strangely, the bars are the same price as usual but in the last few weeks, the bars have been cut in half so you get less bang for your buck. Hmmm... For some reason I knew the prepped meal at this casual spot would be quite good. The dining atmosphere was casual and we went at a slower time which was very good for conversation. I like this concept of dining. Not necessarily for a first date but it offers something different than the norm. I feel that even the pickiest of eaters could find something here that they like very much."}
{"text":"We were on our way to the Blue Star Diner, one of my more favorite places for a delicious breakfast, however because we were pressed for time, we headed down the street and endewd up at The Main Dish. This cafeteria like restaurant just happen to be serving a weekend brunch which was quite good and worth a good blog.  First impressions of the restaurant were nice. It was seperated into stations where you would go to order hot meals, deli, soup/sandwiches, and coffee/alcohol. The place was bright with ample sunlight and provided are very confortable atmosphere for a saturday morning brunch.  We found a table and headed straight over to the hot meals station and ordered our food; Quinoa Oatmeal, Ham and cheddar stuffed frenched toast, and their West Coast Eggs Benedict. Presentation was nice and being able to see the food stations and the chefs prepare the meals were well considered atmospheric perk.  The Quinoa Oatmeal was an excellent comfort food. There was a good mix of oatmeal, quinoa and fruit. It was an excellent take on mom's good old oatmeal when we were kids. The consistency was what you would expect however I found that over time it was turn too mushy. I know that's probably normal of oatmeal, however it got pretty thick pretty fast. Good thing is still tasted good.  The stuffed french toast was enjoyable. It was well portioned and had a good ratio of bread to filling. Although enjoyable, it wasn't something that I would remember forever. The combination of savory with sweet was a good idea and it wasn't too sweet for my palate. I am not much of a sweet tooth and this was pretty much the perfect balance.   The west coast eggs benedict was a little disappointing. It was a hard poached egg on a bed of shrimp over a croissant as opposed to the traditional english muffin. The croisant was a nice change, although I would have preferred the english muffin since that is what I would normally expect with an eggs benedict. The shrimp were of a decent size and the eggs would have been much better had they been soft poached. The most disappointing part of this whole dish however was the hollandaise sauce. It was sour to my tongue. So much so that at first I thought it had gone bad but then realized that it was just an over zealous chef and their lemon juice. When it comes to eggs benny for me, it all comes down to the hollandaise and had that sauce been done right, it probably would not have amplified any of the other faults.  Accompanying our meal was their coffee which to be honest, was quite good. I had a double americano and it was rich, bold, and delicious.  I think I would come back here to the Main Dish. The open concept is great and it's a great place to meet with friends to catch up. The atmospere is definitely a plus here. The only thing is that I would not make specific plans to come here for brunch, a light lunch or afternoon coffee would be my ideal visit to The Main Dish."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, poorly executed.  Ordering shouldn't be confusing or difficult, menu should be representative of what you have to offer."}
{"text":"This is my absolute fav place to pick up lunch / dinner if I'm too lazy to cook or in a rush. Great place for a healthy alternative, a creative spin on classic dishes. The staff are so very kind and courteous. Great for a date night or something more casual with friends/family. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"At my last visit to the Main Dish,  was told to wait to be seated. So we were seated and a menue came. We were asked for our order. Wait! This is different, they used to be self serve. I was told that there is a new owner and that they are doing things differently. The menu was good, and the prices were a lot more reasonable. I like this difference. The food was served and the meal was excellent! Viva the changes. The Main Dish just upgraded from good to great! Service was good too. However, another example of raising the server's \"tip out\" to compensate for the increase in minimum wage. Servers here are made to pay the house 6% of their sales to the house. So if the server is having a good shift and sells $1,000; they have pay the business $60!"}
{"text":"If I lived near here, I'd probably stop cooking altogether. Which really is a shame - I like cooking! Why you gotta be better than me at it, Main Dish?  It's tasty food that's ready to go. Go where? Well, to your home with you, or in your belly right there if you want. They've got some seating. You could park your keister next to the sunny window, and watch Bridgeland go by as you stuff some local, organic whatevers in your face. If you're out an about often, its a pretty nice lunch time alternative to the coffee shops you're probably getting tired of frequenting. The Main Dish would certainly be an alright place for a quick, casual business lunch meeting. For a date? Ehhh... I'd pass, but it might be cool as a stop if you were doing a river path bike ride or something like that.  If it's 5 o'clock somewhere, they've even got wine and beer on tap. If you're having trouble justifying that at whatever time of day you're here, they put together a pretty tasty espresso drinks.  I'd recommend going when the kitchen stations are open, and I wish I could tell you exactly when that is, but if you go over regular person lunch time you should be fine. When they're closed, I've actually found it pretty difficult to piece together a full meal, and all the grab and go stuff seemed really pricey, especially since I'd need to do some grocery shopping and cooking to turn it into a dinner."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  I have been for dinner about a dozen times -- I keep coming back.  The concept is quite different.  It almost has a Sunterra Market feel, where your latte comes from one kiosk, your meal comes from another.  However, you browse the kiosk and place your order, then when you sit down, your drinks and meal are served to you like any other restaurant.  There are very few seats to eat in, but the food is absolutely delicious! As far as price point, I find that eating in is more reasonably priced than take out.  It could have been what I ordered for take out.  However, consistently, their dine in meals are $15 or under.  However, for a party, I took out an artichoke dip, bruschetta, and some gourmet chips and it was almost $40.  Having said that, I received lots of compliments on how delicious the dip was, so it was worth the money to bring a high quality product."}
{"text":"I've been travelling to and 'fro Vancouver to Calgary the past few months and, knowing how much I like my deli to-go section at Whole Foods Market, a friend brought me to The Main Dish.   Unfortunately, nothing at the deli really piqued my interest and instead, we ordered a roast beef sandwich and a scallopini rose pasta dish. Made to order, quick and simple. The roast beef was slow-roasted and served as cold cuts on simple whole wheat/flax bun with your typical sandwich veg, some cheese. Nothing really blew me away but I will definitely try the salads next time and they 'sounded' pretty good (no pics, just words on the menu).  If I had room I would've ended this adventure with their macarons, but I shall save that for next time."}
{"text":"Meh overpriced food. I've tried breakfast, lunch and dinner. All meh and overpriced."}
{"text":"They can make ok soups and salads, but any other dish I've ordered here has been SO poorly put together, tasteless and over-priced. I've given this place several 2nd chances and won't be coming back any more."}
{"text":"While visiting with some girlfriends the other night, we decided to check out The Main Dish.   The idea is that you can go and pick up some entrees and side dishes to take home and eat, or you can eat in. There's all sorts of food. Dishes like lasagna, meatloaf, stir frys, casseroles, and chicken dishes. The types of main dishes are always changing.   But, that's not all, you can just go in to enjoy an espresso and dessert - try the chocolate cake with all of the gooey icing - yum! There's wine and other drinks for those that need some alcohol to get through the night. There's even a happy cappucino, as opposed to the usual sad cappucino.."}
{"text":"We ordered to take away sandwiches and a salad today. I don't mind paying money for Good food. The bread was so dry that it was falling apart. It was horrible. The Internal items of the sandwich were OK nothing special. Panzanella was also ok With so many great bakeries in the city there's no excuse for this kind of bread. There's lots of other restaurants to go to that are much better."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a bite on my way to adventures and ordered from the hot menu.  Overall the food is really good.  Hubs and I both got the sun dried tomato gnocchi and neither of us got what we expected.  It was good but I wasn't prepared for the sauce to mostly be butter.  It was good and the ingredients were great so I can't complain for my brain glitch that didn't translate the menu properly (it makes sense) but I'm not sure I'd reorder that dish.   I've previously had others given me samples of the take out food which is all pretty good but we didn't pick any up ourselves this day.  Their desserts seem to be brought in.   The chocolate explosion is the same one BPs has for example so that's a little off putting."}
{"text":"Nice location, quiet neighbourhood as oppose to some of the other more busier brunch places. We got a table within 15 min (plus!), We ordered the Fit pancakes, and superfoods hash. The pancakes and compote were quite good, I found the hash to be a bit oily. The service is a bit slow, we had to ask the server for cutlery. The Apple chicken sausage was cold and dry. I think the concept of the main dish is good, promoting healthy brunch food but customer service needs to be tuned up, along with making sure hot food is hot! Not too sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"This place is terrific, I was not expecting this when I came for the first time last week, I love the variety of foods, and it's great to eat in, but I enjoyed the takeout as much as eating in, the balsamic mushroom chicken is great, same with the gourmet sandwiches, all made fresh, and the different salads to go, I'm glad I discovered this place as some days you don't feel like cooking, you want something fast and fresh and delicious. Also I like their hours of operation, a must try."}
{"text":"Stopped in here when we were going for coffee in Bridgeland and ended up getting food instead of coffee but the coffee bar looked to have a pretty decent selection. It was getting later in the day and you could tell they were nearing closing time but we still were given a chance to sample the soups and decide which one we wanted. Ordered a half sandwich (which was a pretty generous size) and a small soup for just over $10, portion size was pretty good and the food was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I came here bc it was recommended by a friend who works in the area...I ordered the salad and it took over 30mins to come out...I don't know it they were growing the salad in the back or what but it really should not take that long.    The chicken on the salad was dry and overall my meal was extremely unsatisfying   I do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"I come here more often then I admit as it's not far from me and/or tends to be on the way to or from the next great adventure. In the past I've come to pick up a coffee, lunch or some salads to go with our grilled dinner. This particular trip was to partake in their hot chocolate to support yychotchocolate fest. The hot cocoa was delicious.  The staff are always friendly and helpful. Lots of good eats to choose from and seating for those that want to sit in and take a load off."}
{"text":"Love Main Dish!  My only real complaint is that I don't live closer.  All the food (hot and ready to eat or cold to take home) is wholesome, fresh and filling.  Brunch/breakfast is good, and their teas and latte's are great - and the dessert, even better!  Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Lunch pre-reqs: casual, reasonable, fresh. In Downtown Calgary, you might as well wish for donuts and diamonds to fall from the sky.   But just outside of DT, across the 4th Street flyover, is the lovely little neighbourhood of Bridgeland. Still somewhat affordable and only just having it's first Starbucks blossom a few years ago, Bridgeland is on the cusp of becoming another one of those chic neighbourhoods with all those the brand new duplexes.   In the same complex as the Starbucks is a corner restaurant called the Main Dish. It's a treasure. The deli style atmosphere and sporadic seating arrangement gives it an extremely casual feel. The counters are filled with fresh vegetables, side dishes and dinner ideas and alternatives. Walk towards the back and two chef's will take your order from a selection of at least a dozen full plated meal options. The portions are generous and I don't think I saw anything over $14. Take a look through the desserts for something to take home or just grab a cup of coffee brewed fresh. It's that easy."}
{"text":"The Main Dish earned itself a five stars in my books earlier this week. When it's your turn to pick up dinner and you need a meal that is gluten, dairy and egg free, things get a little tough - especially when it's not something you've got to worry about on a regular basis.  I knew TMD did a lot of nutrition stuff and healthy take-home meals. I had even seen a few gluten free tags on some of their food items. I figured if there was any place that could help me out with a killer dinner AND pull off the food restrictions, it would be here.  As luck would have it, I hit them at a not too busy time and Ryan, the Corporate Executive Chef, was on hand to walk me through all of the dishes and help me pick out our meals... he knew most of it right off the top of my head, but offered to double check the ingredients on a couple of items with regards to the egg content.  I ended up with some ribs, roots and a quinoa salad. I'm not doing them nearly enough justice by not remembering the exact descriptions. The ribs were meaty and saucy, we warmed up the BBQ and popped them on for about 12 minutes. The roots were a mixture of exactly that... potatoes, maybe some squash or sweet potato, with some oils and spices and the quinoa salad was the spicy bean quinoa with some corn and such in it.   Ryan was also great at helping me with quantities of the potatoes and quinoa to get with the ribs. Five fabulous stars for you sir, thanks for providing us with a worry free delightful dinner!"}
{"text":"This rating is for CATERING only. I like going there to dine in, that experience far exceeds the quality and service you get through the catering.  The people who run the catering side are really lousy at customer service and the food is subpar. They need to learn how to better run their kitchen and their administration. I do not recommend using their catering service. Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Main dish is located in General avenue in the NE along with other...general shops.  Parking along the streets can be easily found.  I actually had a chiropractor appointment at Bridgeland Sport & Spine right across the street so I decided to walk over after and grab some brunch.  It was Saturday around 1145AM and a gf of mine met up with me for a bite.  Once you enter, you are greeted by a display of gourmet food you can take home or dine in.  There is a Hot cuisine or soup/salad/sandwich counter which you can also take home or dine in.  There are different displays of drinks; they offer Cru Juice, boxed water, and other drinks or you can go up to the front and order a coffee, latte, smoothies or alcoholic drink beverage.  Gluten free desserts and regular delicious desserts are also available!  They even have a freezer of fiasco gelato and ice cream sandwiches!!    How it works is that you write down your order on a paper, your table number (if applicable) and pay for your order first at the front.  If you dine in, you take your own drinks and they will bring your food right to your table.  There is also outdoor seating which is perfect if the weather is suitable.  We decided to order brunch from the hot cuisine.  I ordered the TMD Bridgeland Benny and my gf ordered the Monte Crisco French toast.  The benny came with back bacon, medium poached eggs on a toasted English muffin with delicious brown butter hollandaise on top.  It was supposed to come with roasted baby tomatoes but mine only came with one.  It also came with a block of white cheddar potatoe cake with a dollop of sour cream? and a little bit of fruit.  Michelle's Monte Crisco French toast was pretty straight forward, a fried ham and cheese sandwich stuffed between thick cuts of French toast, drizzled with maple syrup and a small side of fruit.  I enjoyed my benny, the eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was sweet brown butter and super tasty.  I didn't care for the potatoe cake though, I found it didn't have much flavor and I wish it was crispier!  Michelle's French toast looked crispy, she thought it was okay, nothing special but good.  We had a couple ladies come around and ask if everything was good which was nice.  I wish that they would fill our waters but we had to go up to the front and ask it to be filled (if you got tap water).  Overall, our experience was good.  I don't love their system of paying for your dine in food before you get it but otherwise, the idea of being able to have healthy gourmet food to take away or eat in is a great."}
{"text":"I don't think \"Canadian\" is actually a cuisine.   This place is interesting. It's like a mini-mart that sells high quality made to order meals. Espresso is reasonably priced, don't miss out if you're in the vicinity and want something quick."}
{"text":"Oh I am really in love with this place! I wish there was something just like the Main Dish close to wear I live - I would pop in to buy lunches and dinners to go, and salads, pastas and pre-cooked meals to stock my fridge with, all the time!   The staff is super friendly and helpful. As it was my first time in, they all explained how the place works, the difference between pre-made meals that you can take to-go, as well as the hot and made to order dishes if you are staying to eat in.   The have a small wine bar, high end loose leaf teas, a fabulous selection of truffles and macarons for dessert. And the drink cooler is stocked with really cool lemonades and fresh pressed juices.   I had a soup and salad combo that had one of the best broccoli cheddar soups ever! It was so yummy, but somehow seemed actually healthy (or health conscience at least!)   I 100% suggest stopping in to The Main Dish to try out the array of unique and salads, sides, apps and mains."}
{"text":"Fairly good food, but despite their \"casual stop in for lunch\" atmosphere, they're surprisingly expensive.  $5 for a half-cup of salad and another $3-6 for a drink seems a little much to me.  I've seen many formal dining restaurants cheaper than this place."}
{"text":"This is another place that gets a star removed because of the outlandish prices. I understand rent is expensive in Bridgeland, but I ordered a egg/cheese sandwich on whole grain and it cost $8. That is without anything else...no fruit/coffee/etc.   This is a local grab-and-go eatery where the entire concept is that it's fresh meals to go. If you're not able to cook a gourmet meal, you can pick it up here and then warm it up at home. The food by and large looks delicious, but you would pay the same prices at skipthedishes.ca and get larger portions.   The shop also has some hot-meal areas where you can order a variety of dishes fresh off the grill. It's also possible to get a sandwich made to order. There is also a coffee bar if you don't want to the Starbucks that is a few doors down.  The staff are friendly enough and on the warmer days, there are chairs and tables outside to enjoy a glass of wine with your meal. (You can also order your food and eat at the restaurant.) Everything is definitely well-made and fresh, but I just didn't fid it to be remarkable to warrant the steep prices. If you're in the area and not in the mood to slave over a stove, this is a good place to go, but I know that I will not be making a habit of it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch items is eggs benedicts. Whenever I go to other brunch diners I never order their eggs bennys, main dish has THE best eggs benny, my favorite in particular is the italian benny. Cannot go wrong with this dish.   Now that my friend lives right behind the Main Dish, you can bet I'll be there more often!"}
{"text":"Food = 2 stars Service = 4 stars Value = 1 star Average = 2 stars  I really took exception to paying $15 for a small container of vegetarian chili. The chili itself was good; it wasn't something I couldn't make at home for $5.  You are definitely paying for convenience here and it's not a place I would frequent.  The service here is quite good and they are there to answer any questions you may have.  But I'd rather pay less and help myself."}
{"text":"Welcome to bridgeland! The most expensive place to eat in Alberta!! I  know we are looking for good food and it can be hard to find.  The prices here are shocking! To say the least, I just don't understand how, even with ok food you can charge these prices! $5 for a 250 ml salad? $17 for a pasta, $11 for a sandwich  and $15 for a salad? Like I said the food is just ok and nothing special.   Two people are not walking out of there for under $60! And $60 would be drinking water, tap water. I need to be blown away for those prices, the main dish does not blow me away.  I would rather take the money and buy groceries, I could make 5 meals for the price of one.   Sorry, fail"}
{"text":"Love the place for lunch especially for their salads. Nice wide windows. Cool concept."}
{"text":"I love Main Dish. In the four years I have lived in Bridgeland, I have been to main dish about 50 times or more-and for various reasons. Sometimes it's for an eat in supper (the turkey gnocchi is to die for as is the burger), sometimes to take home supper, sometimes to grab quick meals from the deli (mac and cheese, stuffed chicken breasts, meatloaf), sometimes to grabs dips for a party (tzatziki is deadly), sometimes for breakfast (scrambles rule) but always for the DELICIOUS FOOD. Main Dish sells itself as \"healthy and nutritious\" which I believe they are doing well. Everything is fresh, clean tasty and not over processed or stuffed with junk ingredients. The make home deli items are easily heated in the oven with mains, sides and desserts all available to round out dinner after a hard day at work.   The staff are very friendly and helpful and seem to rarely turnover, so I'm going to assume they are treated well and like their jobs- which is encouraging to see. The atmosphere is casual, outgoing, quaint, cute and fun. Brunch and breakfast is always good and their coffee bar is quite delicious. During summer they setup tables on the sidewalks which makes for a awesome supper in the sun with wine and great food with friends, and within walking distance for me (think drinking more wine than planned trying to absorb as much sun as possible).  Regularly they also bring in olympic athletes to talk about food and their stories about eating and exercise, which is fun and very interesting to hear (not to mention afforded me the opportunity to actually touch a gold medal:). Jazz nights are also a regular occurrence with live musicians which we have attended and enjoyed.  Favorite items:  Mac and cheese, turkey gnocchi, burger with mushroom ragu, Italian stuffed chicken, vanilla bean cheesecake and without a doubt the feta cheese and chick pea salad. Life changing in my opinion.  I recommend dropping by to check it out and see how decent food should taste. The price point is about the same or cheaper than trying to cook your own dinner..."}
{"text":"I do like the wide range in dietary options - gluten free/ dairy free etc but I had a lacklustre experience here  The service was friendly but they couldn't handle lineups very well.   I ordered a roast beef sandwich and a caprese salad. The salad was divine but the sandwich was dull. Boring bread that I could find at Superstore - with same taste and grocery store texture, boring romaine lettuce and mediocre toppings with the beef.   It was 6 dollars for a half-sandwich. Not worth the money."}
