{"text":"Not a big fan at all. The service was very slow compared to the BBQ places at finch and midland even though there was only a few tables in at the time. The chicken cartilage was super fat and oily. The lamb skewers were only so-so. The only redeeming thing was the BBQ covina fish. Everything else was either not salted enough  (squid tentacles, cabbage) or super salty (dried tofu).

Maybe the hotpot here is better. But since this place is also advertised as a BBQ joint, it stays as a 2 star and a recommended no return for me until I try the hot pot."}
{"text":"This place is really conflicting for me-it's so good but so bad at the same time. No matter the number of stomach ache's I get I always end up returning here for some late night snacks (open till 2am everyday). It's also pretty inexpensive. 

People in the area call this place \"skewers\" as they're known for their BBQ meats on skewer sticks. They're also known for cheap pitchers. We're a fan of the lamb and sausage skewers but be aware they're quite spicy! We usually get this spicy hot pot casserole (EXTREMELY NUMBING KINDA SPICY, not recommended for weak stomachs) that is usually the cause of our stomach aches. It's pretty filling and delicious and comes with regular hot pot items already inside the casserole (beef, spam, vegetables, squid, watercress, tofu, fishball etc). I would also recommend getting their smash cucumber which is basically just chopped up cucumber in garlic and their caramelized sweet potato. They also have AYCE hot pot but it's charcoal hot pot, cool idea but not that good. Options are also limited for hot pot. 

If you're looking for some upscale Chinese restaurant, don't come here. During our visit I killed two cockroaches on the wall and saw two more nearby. They also have a sauce station where you make your own sauce and there were black flies everywhere (sauces were also not covered...). It's extremely unsanitary but ironically an upgrade from last year (things got renovated last year and it looks more \"new\" on the inside). 

As for service, food comes out quick as always but communication is hard if you don't speak Chinese. 

Overall I'd give food 3.5 stars but the uncleanliness of the place just brings it down to 2 stars (maybe should be 0 because of the cockroaches...)."}
{"text":"Cheap Beer ($3.50 a small draft), BBQ Skewers of Meat and Veggie and All You Can Eat Hot Pot ($22.95) ?! And you can have these as late as you want as the restaurant is open till 3 AM!

This is a Winner! or A Wynner? Grill?

The inside is nicely decorated and clean VS the BBQ restaurant before. They have this Special Charcoal Hotpot that means you can even enjoy a hot pot out in the patio.

We ended up sharing some Lamb Skewers ($4.99 for 3) and Winter melon Lamb Soup ($9.99)  Both were A-OK. I guess I need to be back to try out other items as there are a lot of others to choose from.

10% off if pay by cash."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try considering it looks like it is in a ghetto street plaza area with poor lighting. 

Going into the restaurant it was surprisingly trendier than what I had expected. 

They offer an all you can eat hot pot option but I wasn't really in the mood for it so we decided to try out their ala carte menu.  

This four star review has a few caveats. It basically applies to only two dishes. The seafood rice and the roasted pig belly skewers. 

This place surprisingly had one of the best tasting seafood fried rice I have eaten at this price. Short of paella I haven't had any rice dish with actual shells. The squid they had were very soft they are definitely not over cooked. The rice itself isn't too oily either and makes you want to eat more. 

The second dish I enjoyed that night was the roasted pork belly. If I wasn't filled up with the other bad dishes, this would've made a satisfying meal with the rice. It had the xin Jiang like spice but not too spicy. They have parts that's all fat which would've gone well with the rice if there was any left. But it's very fragrant and savoury. 

Service wasn't that bad. In fact they had a service call system which response time was generally quick. And you can press a button for water and bill rather than wait for server to take your request and go back and forth. 

Now that's all the good parts. However there were three dishes we ordered that were definitely sub par. If I considered those dishes this would've been a two star review. 

Roasted quail egg. Arrived tepid. Barely soaked up the spices around it. 

Spicy fish balls. The spice was overpowering and the balls were meh. 

Pork and leek dumplings. The pork tasted like it came from the cheap section of Foody Mart. 

However this was my first time at this restaurant and I was just choosing dishes at random.  They specialize in hot pot which I didn't try so I didn't think it would be fair to rank them poorly for some random dishes."}
