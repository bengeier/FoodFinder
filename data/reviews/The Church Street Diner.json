{"text":"Love. Closed for a while, was thrilled it reopened. Simple but tasty menu, prices are reasonable, nice staff, worth the wait for a table or for food."}
{"text":"Used to like going there for a good reliable breakfast; until they changed their menu. The Molly wood breakfast used to be a good deal, and you could choose your side. No longer... Everything is extra, which makes for an expensive breakfast. I'm now having to look elsewhere for that good, reliable and cheap breakfast."}
{"text":"It's now called Church Strret Bistro. 
It's absolute garbage. Over priced for what u get and the food is trash. I ate Roti de Porc with roast potatoes. I literally had 5 little pieces of potatoes and my pork chop tasted like something i could make and i can't cook. I will never go here ever again."}
{"text":"Nice place with good and simple menu. Service was really good as well. Try their eggs Benedict or Goldilocks"}
{"text":"Decent food, reasonable price, and friendly staff. I wish they had a bigger dining area though. On busy days the place can get really crammed."}
{"text":"What in the world are these people thinking? You can't serve fake potatoes and crappy bread etc...and stay in business. The only time the food was good was when they had a dude with a red chef hat in the kitchen. He made some awesome breakfasts. Now? The owners need to rethink this whole thing and make real food."}
{"text":"I've lived in the Village for a year and a half, and I love going to the Church Street Diner. I've taken my parents there, my friends there, and I rave about it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced breakfast. 

I have never tried their lunch menu, but my parents did and said it was excellent. 

Their eggs benedict is delicious and the eggs have always been pouched perfectly for me. Their homefries are good and they give you a good portion size. It's something you can finish off without feeling like you won't be able to move for the rest of day, but they definitely never leave you hungry.

Their baked eggs are also really nice and flavourful.

Their staff has always been really friendly and attentive and even though the diner only seats a handful of people at any time, I've never had to wait terribly long to get a seat. 

I don't know how this place was before it closed and reopened, but I've never had a bad experience here, so the rest of the reviews boggle me."}
{"text":"A nice friendly place with a really good breakfast.  Never tried any of the lunch items.  Big Bear Breakfast is great with 3 eggs, sausage, bacon, pea-meal, potatoes & toast.  The multigrain toast is really tasty.
Not sure why the previous reviewer thought the photos showed the victims of a ritual killing dumped in a field.  No blood, no bondage, nothing that made me see a dead guy.  One image shows the same guy three times on the ground in a field."}
{"text":"I love the staff here.  I love the food.  I love the ambiance.  This has been and will be my favourite place for lunch on Church St."}
{"text":"I just moved into the neighbourhood, so I have been keeping my eye out for a good 'ol fashioned weekend brunch place.

It was not as cheap as I like my all-day breakfast. I think a standard eggs, bacon (or sausage) and potatoes shouldn't be more than $6-8. I went with the french toast with a side of bacon which I think turned out to be ~10 bucks. That was fine. Now, with a cheap breakfast I'll accept cheap table syrup. Then I saw on the menu that you could request REAL maple syrup. But! It cost $2.55 extra. That's almost 3 bucks for maybe a few tablespoons. They must have problems with customers filling a glass with the stuff... I guess? This is a minor problem, as most breakfast joints don't even have real maple syrup, but I was still surprised at the cost.

I appreciated that the server told me the truth when I asked if the \"famous\" eggs benedict were with hollandaise made from scratch. It's not homemade, but she told me it was really good nonetheless.

I am a tea drinker and I hate when tea comes in a tiny little pot that would not make even 1 1/2 cups. As if offering more hot water will make it better; \"yes, I'd love not quite boiling water in a cold teapot with a bag that has already been brewed. Thanks!\" The Church Street Diner didn't do that - I got a normal sized teapot which filled my cup about 3-4 times, maybe even a bit more than that. 

I might go back again, but it won't be for the \"Wow! I actually have 10 bucks left in my wallet from last night!\"  breakfast. And I really like that kind of breakfast."}
{"text":"3.75 stars

This \"diner\", though self-identified as a \"diner\" isn't really a diner, at least in my mind. It does have a diner-like menu, but the vibe and décor makes it more of a café...or a bistro...or a café.

I had the \"Molly Wood's Breakfast\", but substituted the savoury beans for the meat. It included \"homechips\" and choice of a variety of toasts - white, whole wheat, rye and multi-grain. This selection automatically elevated it above most other breakfast places, but the quality of the multi-grain shot it to the top of the list, toast-wise. Even better than The Avenue Diner.

Now, the term \"homechips\" raised a bit of a red flag. We asked whether they were home fries or French fries, and we assured by the waiter that they were home fries, as he described their dimensions. Yes, they were shaped like home fries, but they were definitely French fries. Tasty, but not home fries. 

Everyone was very happy with their meals, and the waiter was attentive and very friendly. Why 3.75 stars? Well, I just couldn't put it in the category with Free Times Cafe or The George Street Diner (esp. for vibe), but it was better than 3.5, that's for sure! ;-)

NB It's important to note that they served Raspberry (D.O. - \"Rasp, the best berry\".) jam. This probably doesn't seem like much, but after visiting 90 different breakfast spots, we could count the raspberry jam on one hand, with a thumb left over. The standard? Strawberry."}
{"text":"I love this diner! I think it's the best food on Church Street. When ever I'm in town you will find me at Church Street Diner. The cheese burger is my favorite! Great service, great location, Oh almost forgot the best french toast on the brunch menu."}
{"text":"This place seems to have gone through a lot of changes recently.
It used to offer a good breakfast, but I'm afraid that is no longer the place.  The prices have gone up, and the service is far less friendly now. Numerous requests for them to turn down the music (at 9:30am on a Saturday morning when the restaurant was empty) went unanswered.  

And thirty dollars is a lot of money to pay for eggs and coffee."}
{"text":"Of every place I check out on the Church Wellesley area, all the place were shacked up so I couldn't get a good place to eat instead I went to a local small diner but it was worth the wait to eat there. Got me a sandwich and a drink worth around 16 dollars because I added 15% of the tip."}
{"text":"The Church Street Diner is literally at the end of my street....how wonderful ! 

This morning went for breakfast with three great friends ! 

James and I had the Eggs Benny and boy it was great, came with either salad of homemade chips - we both opted for the chips. The English Muffin was actually toasted perfectly, not like allot of other places that barely even warm it up. I like my eggs soft and they were done just right. The Hollandaise was homemade and really nice. And the peameal cooked on the flat top so the edges were nice and crispy, yet the bacon itself nice and tender.

Bill had the steak and eggs and considering that there was just toast crusts left on the plate - I think he enjoyed it. 

Dennis had the morning special, a Greek omelet and he ate it so fast it was like a blink of an eye - I think he enjoyed it. 

The service was fantastic - they even asked if we wanted breakfast dessert ! ha ha....nice try.....

The decor is great - love the artwork ! 

Will certainly be back very soon....."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times when I'm super duper hungover from the night before.

It's a really small, super cute diner in the village!

The service is awesome, but nothing really stands out there for me in terms of food.

But, I will definitely keep coming back here for my hangover cure!"}
{"text":"A homoerotic breakfast? I guess this is Church street. From the wall art featuring photos of naked men ritually killed and their bodies dumped in a field to the breakfast items named after gay subcultures, the Church Street Diner is more than a breakfast sausage fest. And what great sausage they serve up. Best sausage I've ever slipped into my hungry, curious mouth.

The eggs (over easy) were nothing to write home about and the home fries lacked seasoning. Still, when you add in two slices of toast (rye bread is an option), jam, the aforementioned amazing sausage, twink-style bacon, and water sports pea-meal ham, the big bear breakfast for $10 will fill you nicely for a day. 

Service is friendly and awesome. Decor is homey, if you ignore the photo of the ritual killing."}
{"text":"This place should have stayed closed.  They re-opened after what seemed like forever, they had a building permit, but I never saw anything going in or out in the way of building supplies.

Viv and I went here from breakfast, and wow it was BAD!  I ordered over medium eggs and got something that might have still clucked at me when I poked it.  Viv got the french toast and it was very dry and tasteless.

The staff was friendly and the place is cute, but the food sucks and that's what you're really going there for.  They are only open for Breakfast and lunch, so I'm not sure how they are making any money as it seems the village comes alive at night.

Avoid it if you can.  I would take the Golden Griddle on Carlton over this place...and we all know how ick the GG is."}
