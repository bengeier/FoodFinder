{"text":"A convenience store/sub shop.  This is how they describe themselves: Deli-4-Less offers a full delicatessen as well as a hot food counter with fried chicken, subs and hot dogs. Deli-4-Less also offers a large selection of beer and wine, along with a friendly neighborhood atmosphere that begs for you to come back again and again.  We got several hot subs to go.  I'd say they are on par with Subway quality-wise.  Slightly fewer vegetable toppings to choose from, but also a little cheaper (most foot longs are $5.99).  The 6in subs we got all had stickers on them that say \"collect 6 and get 1 free,\" which makes them an even better value.  I would go again, especially since the location is so convenient."}
{"text":"I eat at this place at least once a week. They have excellent subs with lots of options. Foot long subs are only $5.99.   They also have a nice craft beer selection as well as the typical convenient store items.  They also have a great deli counter and are one of the few stores in the area that brings in locally made cheese.    The staff are awesome and are always friendly.  If you are looking for a gyro in the Brecksville area, Deli4less has got you covered! They have killer gyros for only $5.99.  Big fan!."}
{"text":"Not a bad convenience store!  They have everything you need...well...everything you would typically expect to get at a convenience store, at least.  On top of that, they do have a sandwich shop and have containers of jerky/cheese that are a great go-to for a quick snack or for when people come over."}
{"text":"Expecting a normal slightly creepy convenient store then I was pleasantly surprised. They have a pseudo wine cellar area that real is just a nice nook in the store to sell wine. I also really enjoy the toasted subs they have here. All are $5 and are really tasty. I had the Philly cheese steak and the Italian. Eight on a scale of ten when it comes to me rating sub shops. They also have every kind of energy drink you can think of.  I classify this place as a slightly higher end convenient/beverage store with a sub shop in it.  They got your $5 footlong playa..."}
