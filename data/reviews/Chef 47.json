{"text":"Great Turkish place. Had the beef d√∂ner it was amazing. Soft and juicy and generous portions. If in the area again will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My mother-in-law and l went here on a Monday for lunch. We both were pleased overall with our experience. 

I started with the lentil soup; smooth texture yet hearty taste, made to perfection. I continued with tantuni, a type of durum wrap with tiny chunks of spiced beef and onions.  Although it wasn't really authentic It tasted pretty good. 

My in-law tried the izmir kumru; a generously portioned cooked deli meat (reminds me of spam) with melted cheese, tomatoes, pickles, ketchup and mayo in sesame bun. Enough said. 

No dessert, so we ended up trying some baklava from next door on our way home. Thumbs up! 
Kudos for the service. 
Nice and clean room. 
Easy access for stroller. 
Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh, nothing comes out of the freezer. Great service, fantastic taste and hospitality. Must go place."}
{"text":"First time I tried Turkish food.  Not a fan of what I ordered. Maybe it just not my preference. I had the salad which did not have any dressing on it therefore it was a bit bland. 

It appears to be family owned and operated. Seeing that is really nice and I love it the family atmosphere. But i did not enjoy the bland food. Maybe there is something else for me to like next time."}
