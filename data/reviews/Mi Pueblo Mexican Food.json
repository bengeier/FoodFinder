{"text":"Was in the area and made a spur of the moment stop as we were hungry. I ordered the chili rellenos and taco plate, and my husband a chimichanga plate. Both were very good! The chips were also great, very light and crispy. Much better than any of the chain Mexican places. The place was small but clean and friendly. Was so glad we stopped!!"}
{"text":"We love this neighborhood mom & pop restaurant. We've eaten there since day one. We won't move out of the area due to living .4 miles from Mi Pueblo. Absolutely the best fresh salsa in town!  Good luck to the kids who now run the show!  Sincerely, Your neighbors"}
{"text":"I was really craving some amazing street tacos! So I had the 5 mini al pastor tacos!  Aaaaaaaaaand meh lol Rice, Beans, Guac, and Salsa were just the normal Mexican food taste you would expect - nothing special. I think what ruined it for me was the meat, it was a little tough."}
{"text":"Saw this as an option for a quick bite on the way out of Scottsdale.  It's not really an eat in the car type place, but it was good. Chip and salsa bar inside.   Got the two chimichanga plate. Really well seasoned meats in both. Rave reviews.  Got the carne asada burrito plate. Lots of meat. Very good flavor.  I ordered the two shredded beef hardshell taco plate. I'm going to say the beef was fried in the taco shell. It was fresh and had a good ratio of meat, lettuce and cheese. Having tried the beef chimichanga it's a bit disappointing that the meat in the taco isn't the same. However it was good.   The beans were decent. The rice was ok.  Overall it's the best Mexican food I've had in the area. I've only eaten at a handful of Mexican food places in the Arizona though."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to get some decent mexican food for the money. The menu is extremely easy navigate. There is self serve chips and salsa and they are relatively quick to serve your food since the menu is of composed of mainly the basics. The place is pretty small inside and doesnt seat that many people though if you plan on bring a big party for whatever reason."}
{"text":"Sooooooo delicious! When you walk in, it is a small place that has a fast food type style of ordering. They offer different combos with rice and beans, and it comes out super fast!! Great food, great service, quiet hole-in-the-wall type of Mexican place! Definitely coming back! Cheap too!"}
{"text":"Had green burrito with pork.  Excellent! Not fatty.  Daughter had taquitos.  Loved them."}
{"text":"Got chicken chimi ... so good.. so much food. Have come here multiple times . Everything is always great.  Family owned and operated.  Great people."}
{"text":"Best salsa in town and I've lived here for 37 years and been to the Salsa Challenge every year, but nobody beats Mi Pueblo. I like to mix the mild and hot 50/50. All their food is delicious and very consistent. Not as greasy as *bertos. So glad I live right down the street. Oh yeah, their party platters are awesome too."}
{"text":"I wish I would have combed through the reviews a little more carefully. Just a typical place, ordered a fajita burrito to go. I noticed after a few minutes that they placed a styrofoam take out container in the microwave. A minute or two later, my order was given to me.   Putting aside all the health concerns of microwaving Styrofoam, the food was nothing special.   I would advise anyone to keep looking because this place definitely does not serve your food fresh."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good hole-in-the-wall type Mexican food restaurant,  but we'll have to keep looking. The service was great, but the food was average. Tortillas were store-bought and there was little flavor. It was ok for a quick lunch, but we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"If you live in North Phoenix and don't know about this place, you will be pleasantly surprised at the flavor of the food here.  This place is so good I'm surprised the line isn't out the door.  Not one thing, but everything is delicious.  The white enchiladas are fantastic. The carnitas burrito is outstanding.  There isn't a thing that I've had here that isn't great.  I can't say enough good things about the food here."}
{"text":"Definitely great Mexican food. They  have the best Nachos....EVER! I am a huge nachos fan (almost as much as french toasts but not quite...) and I can honestly say since I've been in Phoenix (a  year now) they have the best!"}
{"text":"We went to this place this evening to redeem a yelp \"$10 for $5\" deal. I'm not sure how they manage to keep a stellar rating. It was good food, but the price was high and the portions were tiny. The quesadilla we ordered was the worst offender, as it was made from a taco-sized tortilla. I have never seen such a tiny quesadilla in my life. If it was a kid's meal I may have understood, but it was $4.99! The chimichanga was pathetic, too. I think the guy working there must have given us a kid's chimi on accident, because i can't imagine anyone spending money at this place on a regular basis for a chimi so small. It was literally 2\" wide by 6\" long by 1\" tall. That's for a $6.99 chimi. Macayo's charges a few bucks more for a chimi that's more than twice the size. I guess the only decent thing was the free chips and salsa, although the chips had enough salt on them to decrease my cardiac health by about 50%. I'm not sure why anybody salts anything anymore, with all the negative medical news on excessive salt consumption, but that's another problem altogether. As for this place: I tried it...probably won't be back. Caramba is a much better restaurant for a much better price."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is always excellent, the restaurant is always very clean and the service is top notch!!"}
{"text":"Best little Mexican restaurant in the area. Carne Asada is tender and not fatty!! Eat here a couple times a week"}
{"text":"This is one of my familys favorite hole in the wall establishments in Phoenix. Almost as good as Valle Luna or the original Garcias on 35th and ossborn, but for a fraction of the price. Great tacos, rellenos, encheladas. The homemade salsa is excellent. They have coupons on yelp, groupon, and entertainment book, don't pass them up."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to see about the groupon I asked the cashier if I could buy 2, he asked to see my phone i handed it over thinking he was just reading the fine print and he hit buy and confirm. I later called to speak to a manager about this unauthorized charge and was told to call some other time the Metro Center location was not  anymore help. I'am astounded the clerk had the audacity to spend my money without my consent."}
{"text":"This place is great. You wouldn't know it by the looks of it but I have been taking people here for years and the food is always fast and very tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have not had one bad thing here. I have tried almost everything and it is delicious! My boyfriend and I used to live right around the corner and now we live in Peoria. We still get food from here often because it is worth the drive. Their carnitas burrito, shrimp burrito and machaca breakfast burrito are my absolute favorites and some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Just ordered take out on the Yelp app, it was super easy, the food was fresh, hot, delicious, and the pickup was quick and easy.  And they remembered the small things - chips, salsa, and silverware in the bag.  This is going to become a regular stop!"}
{"text":"They used to have some awesome Tortas on the menu but they sometimes have the bread if you ask they can make them.  I really like the fish tacos omnomnom"}
{"text":"The mr. and I stopped here for a quick bite on the way to the grocery store.  We dined in this time, which had its ups and downs.  I opt for the 2 shredded beef taco plate and the Mr. tried the shrimp tacos.  We grabbed our drink, chips and salsa and sat.  The mild and hot sauces were very good causing me to up my star eating from last time.  I'm typically a \"hot\" chick- but even the mild had me going back for thirds.  The dining area was slightly better than a fast food spot and one table near the soda fountain had two rags laying out.  The floor was not very clean near the fountain either.  Our platters arrived which looked yummy- nice size servings of rice and beans.  My tacos were crisp and not stingy! The beef was a good consistency, typical lettuce and finely shredded cheese.  The only downside is when you see oil drip on your plate as you eat.   His shrimp tacos were definitely healthier as the corn tortilla was not fried.  The shrimp were freshly cooked though quite small.  He also opted for whole (not refried) beans which were fresh & homemade.  We will be back for the salsa and to try more menu options at this hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is a total \"hole in the wall,\" but it serves the best Mexican food! So far, everything I have tried is absolutely delicious! My favorite is the shrimp burrito - but beware - IT'S HUGE!   There is very little sitting room so avoid the lunch hour if you can."}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall Mexican food in the valley! And they have a cute little salsa bar too. Love it!"}
{"text":"1st time here.. Very friendly place. Small .. But there food is OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!  We ordered a carne asada burro with red sauce.  My wife ordered menudo,cheese quesadilla,the cheese just dripped once we were eating it.  Lol.  Everything came our FAST and hot.  They kindly gave us a small patch of carne asada for my kid.. Everything is around $10.   Are new place.   Come check it out.."}
{"text":"Me and my husband were in the area and decided to try this place out. I'm glad we did!! Food was delicious!! I love the chimichangas and the chips, salsa, and bean dip are great! We don't mind traveling from Tolleson to eat here."}
{"text":"We have eaten in the same shopping center at Times Square and never paid attention to the west end where Mi Pueblo was located.  Yelp reviewers were right on point about this restaurant, small, nicely decorated not like  most small mom and pop Mexican restaurants.  You order at the counter and everything is made to order.  Place was packed with most people waiting for to go orders.   Wife ordered a carne Asada burrito with rice, gucamole, sour cream and lettuce and tomato.  She calls this's Chicago style.   I had two chicken enchiladas with green sauce, beans and rice on the side.  Both were excellent and served on a real dish with actual silverware.  Almost forgot, they have complimentary chips and salsa, nice bonus.  Will definitely add Mi Pueblo to my regular list!  Stop by and give them a try"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Best horchatas! I love getting the carne asada street tacos, they at small but filling!"}
{"text":"Tried this place twice already and it's quickly becoming a top favorite. The Beans are way better than any other place and the rice is top notch too. I love that they have a delicious beef tamale as one of their options in the 2 item and 3 item combos. Also tried beef tacos, chicken enchiladas, chicken flautas and the chimis are good too.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Tacos al pastor. Mild red salsa. I love you. The breakfast burritos and green chile are solid here too but man tacos al pastor (drool)..."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. And they have a chips and salsa bar! I got the enchilada trio but I've also tried a beef taco, chili relleno, and a tamale. They have mix n match combo options too. I will be going back."}
{"text":"5 stars because it's tied for my favorite 'fast' Mexican food. My other favorite is rolando's on 35th and Peoria but I don't live over there anymore. Thankfully I live less than a mile from this gem."}
{"text":"Lovely little hole in the wall spot near our hood. Great staff, varied and tasty menu choices, never a long wait for food etc. Love it, but I'm slightly afraid the rest of Phoenix will find out! It's okay if they do, I can share"}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. I've eaten here several times. My first time was horrible. I always get the two beef taco combination. The meat tasted bad. I didn't return for a few years but when I fianally tried again the food was so food I came back a few days later. Still good... Unfortunately the last few times I've been there the beef had that funny taste again so I haven't been back."}
{"text":"I stopped here occasionally when I'm in the mood for Mexican.   The food is good.   However the reason I go there is because The staff is always friendly.   It's like they're happy to see you.  Other than that it\"s just an okay place with good food"}
{"text":"Great people better food been coming here for years and moving 30 miles away i still make my way over there."}
{"text":"Small place, but nice looking and clean inside and good food. We experienced fast and friendly service. The chips and salsa bar is a nice touch. I wasn't expecting such a good experience from a small place like this and kind of a weird location.  The horchata was the best I ever had!"}
{"text":"Went there this morning and had the bacon burrito...YUM! Talk about filling...I have a big appetite and this place fills me up~  Check it out if you are in the area it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"I went in and ordered dinner for my family to go. Got steak fajitas, green pork burrito, chicken nachos, and a kids meal. Took about 15 minutes, which I was completely fine with since that usually means it's made fresh. Everything was so good! Huge portions! Seriously, the nachos are a meal alone or a great starter for a family of 4. They gave me a ton of chips and salsa to take home too. Great customer service as well. The inside is a bit dated, but can't the same be said of most great small restaurants? I'd rather they spend the money on food quality and great staff than new decorations."}
{"text":"Good food. They have good salsa, I hate the watery salsa some Mexican restaurants have. Been going here for years, never a problem."}
{"text":"One of my Most Favorite places to go, the Tostadas are the Bomb! Everything here at Mi Pueblo is AMAZING!!! I LIVE FOR THEIR BREAKFAST MENU!! Chilaquiles are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby... Of course the interior isn't much to be desired, but I have always learned that some of the best Mexican places are tiny little run down shacks.   We hit this place up on a Groupon purchase and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious plates that arrived. The fresh chips and salsa were great, service was pleasant and quick, as our overall experience was above average. I had the tamale/enchilada plate and my husband had the two chicken tacos plate. Both were pretty good and the price was cheap (even if we weren't using our $1 for $10 Groupon).  Thanks for the experience Mi Pueblo Mexican! We enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Small Mexican restaurant . Salsas pretty good . Ordered the chicken enchiladas tasted great . I would def come back to it again .Friendly staff plates are served on actual plates and he foods is presented in a tasteful manner ..."}
{"text":"We where looking for something that wasn't a chain and had real Mexican style food and stumbled accross this location. Small but very inviting, great portions and very good food! The service was very nice and they were extremely helpful as we were deciding what to get! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Giving a 5 star mostly because of my counterpart's opinion. He absolutely loves this place. As a vegetarian, there are some options but not as many as I would like. A nice snag, service was friendly, relatively inexpensive. If you live in the area and haven't tried it, give it a whirl."}
{"text":"So many good reviews and they are not wrong!  If you like Mexican food you'll probably love this place! It's not like those other family \"chains\", the food quality is much better. I have eaten here a handful of times and no complaints so far. Food and Service were great!  I usually get the El Trio Enchiladas dinner (E4). It's a great option if you haven't eaten here before. If you have room for desert you should try the donut shop next door lol."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant! My husband has been going here for years and I love the tacos!"}
{"text":"The food is authentic! My favorite is chicken fajitas and my husband's pork tacos. Chicken enchiladas and egg burrito are good too. The place is clean, the food is hot and the flavor is consistent."}
{"text":"Great hard tacos, can't get enough of the free chips and salsa, and amazing California burrito! Small place but great service and food! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. Authentic, fairly affordable, and generous portions. Get the hard tacos! Seriously, one of the better places out there.  The only reason why it loses a star is because the inside of the restaurant is very old and dated, the tables are often sticky, and the restroom looks like it hadn't been cleaned in years."}
{"text":"Great food, you can taste how fresh it is. I always get their Carne asada burrito and it is great every time. Not to mention how nice the staff is their."}
{"text":"Decided to come by and check out this local mom and pop restaurant. It is close to my house and on the way to pickup my granddaughter. She is so much fun.  Located in the same complex as Good Will and right next to a popular donut chain. This little restaurant serves up a good variety of the more popular Mexican dishes.  Inside is very small with several tables and chairs to enjoy your meal. The menu has a good selection of photos so that you can just point at what you want to eat. They even have a nice complimentary chip and salsa bar to get you started.  Ordered the Green Chili Pork Burrito Combo plate and helped myself to both the mild and hot salsas. The burrito tasted OK and seemed to be filled mainly with beans and green chili gravy. The cubed pork seemed to be hiding and required a bit of searching to find the rather small pieces.   This place more or less cranks out some very typical Tex-Mex style food with not a whole lot of flavor. Even the salsas were pretty bland and I had to add a large amount of hot sauce to kick things up a notch.  Service was friendly and the place was pretty busy. I would not call this authentic Mexican food unless you are just used to the Americanized versions of this cuisine. The prices are reasonable and the food in general falls into my  A-OK category.  Give them a try and see what you think. Everyone has a different opinion of what they enjoy when it comes to Mexican food. LEFT STILL HUNGRY!  3 STARS"}
{"text":"All time favorite go to for a busy night! Food is always delicious! Guy at the counter ( I really need to learn his name) is always friendly! Love love love the chips and salsa that are complementary with every order!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Close to my house, prices are great, and oh yeah the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time because of a group 5 for 10 deal.  I have to say the staff was really friendly.  Prices reasonable.  The quesadilla I had was awesome.  I also ordered some nachos but ended up having sour cream and guacamole on them which I couldn't eat.  I definitely will be going back.  This takes the lead for my cheap taco spot in town."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars. Service was quick. Food was decent. I probably wouldn't come back. But it wasn't bad. It was just okay."}
{"text":"Got two of the vegetarian burritos... Just amazing. Great ingredients... Awesome staff. Way good prices. Happy chubby Sarahs to boot."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years with my family. Tried almost everything on the menu. The chili rellenos are almost as good as my own! 1/ 3 good places in the valley with chilli rellenos that good. Beef stew tastes like my Tatas own broth, the quality of the food definitely doesn't go without notice and don't even get me started on the salsas.... PHENOMENAL!  It's a little hole in the wall,definitely... but it's my neighborhood hidden gem. My whole family loves this place! :)"}
{"text":"very small place with a big menu.  they offer free chips and salsa bar where you choose from 2 mild salsas and one hot.  the hot salsa was not my flavor and I like the hot salsas.   the mild red salsa was good.  I ordered the chimichanga combo with all rice.  rice was good but chimi was not crispy it was soft and gooey.  my wife liked the meat flavor I did not.  my wife ordered the carne asada burrito combo.  shei liked it but did not love it.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Mi Pueblito was my first experience using yelp take out and it was all around a great experience. I walked right in at the time my order was supposed to be ready and it was waiting for me.  I got the nachos and although I didn't feel that the ingredients were exceptional, I was able to use them as like two meals so it was a great deal. Place was small and cozy. You place your order at the counter. Staff was friendly. Hope to try something new next time!!"}
{"text":"We came in pretty close to closing (oops!) and the salsa bar was still fresh, employees were happy to serve and were really helpful! The food was fresh and REALLY GOOD. My husband and I can't wait to make this a regular spot when I'm too lazy to cook!"}
{"text":"Very good chimichanga with red sauce. You get plenty of food. You serve yourself chips & salsa."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food.  They ran out of guac though for the day (i mean they were closing in 30 min).   Food was good and customer service was good as well."}
{"text":"He tacos were great but the burrito I ordered came out drenched in some sauce...wasn't very good and there were only few pieces of meats. The mini tacos are the way to go next time, if I go back"}
{"text":"In town visiting family and tried this place. Food and service was great!! Wish they were in Tucson."}
{"text":"This used to be the best place to eat lately I have noticed the food is not as good As it used to be. Bummer we have been going here for years"}
{"text":"We have made the breakfast burritos a regular tradition! The food is always fresh and love their salsas. Javier is always friendly and accommodating.  And for dinner, don't miss the green chile chicken enchiladas. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pork and carne asada tacos and it had bone fragments in one of them, glad I didn't break a tooth. Also price for 5 small tacos was around $11 which is way too expensive for what you get. Not sure what everyone is raving about, but the Mexican food I'm used to is at a much higher standard than what this place offers."}
{"text":"YUM!  Came here with the hubs.  I was able to get my authentic Mexican food fix and my horchata fix.  Scrum-diddily-uptious :)  Only thing- the hubs ordered me chicken enchiladas instead of cheese.  -1 point for the husband."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for about 10 years. The salsa is very fresh and my favorite salsa in the valley. Everybody can serve themselves chips and salsa. I've gotten shredded beef burritos that were fantastic. I get breakfast burritos always fantastic. Huevos rancheros is one of my favorite plate there. The staff are always very nice. They have never gotten my order wrong before. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. The atmosphere is very relaxed and personable. They normally have light Spanish music playing in the background."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here every Sunday for 2 years.  The service is efficient and courteous and the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"I just recently moved to the area and I was on the look out for a decent Mexican restaurant.  My partner and I ate here yesterday and it was actually quite good. We enjoyed a carne asada burrito and a quesadilla.   On top of the good food they also have a salsa and chip bar. I may be Hispanic, but I tend to stay away from salsa. So for those that like salsa..enjoy!  I would recommend this establishment and I will definitely come back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"So so good!!!! Staff is friendly and serves you when you eat in. It's a little small inside, but we didn't feel cramp at all. We've been to the location at Metro many times and I honestly like this one better! The salsas are amazing! Good flavor and perfect amount of heat!!! The six halved chicken tacos is the way to go! Flavor is amazing, but chunks of chicken and plenty of oooey gooey cheese!!!!!"}
{"text":"Father's Day everywhere is packed, found this place on yelp, cannot believe it's not busy. Food is delicious. I usually have to add salt when eating out, but here everything was spot on.  This is definitely a hidden gem. Will be back to try more dishes :)"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I used to work near the other location (near Metro Center) and ate there all the time. I was delighted to find another location closer to where I'm working now. Great place for lunch or take-away after work. The chips and salsa are possibly the best anywhere. The salsa is clearly fresh-made and it ROCKS.   I swear they don't make anything until you order it. My favorite is the fajita burrito with chicken. The veggies are fresh-grilled and always have just the right texture, and the chicken is perfectly prepared as well. I have NEVER seen them put a styrofoam container in the microwave (as one poster stated) and can't imagine why they would (or would need to).   This is not a fancy place. The atmosphere is just adequate. Go to Chili's for that. If it's really good food you're after, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"good. easy. phoned in order, picked it up. Not a solid location to eat..but, great for carry out. Food is very good."}
{"text":"Love the food and service. Anytime I want some really good burritos this is the place I come to. Its a bit of a drive for me but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how good the food was at this tiny place. I normally avoid the \"hole-in-the-wall\" type places, but I decided to give this one a try and SO happy I did. The food was well priced and not too greasy. The ingredients taste fresh and it has that family owned feeling."}
{"text":"My sweetie and I had lunch here. Very good! Chips and salsa were the best. Enchiladas and tacos were amazing. We will be back for sure. They had CNN on their tv and I asked the manager to at least turn the volume down so we would have to listen to that junk and he did. Nice!"}
{"text":"The perfect neighborhood Mexican restaurant. An absolute gem. My favorite dish is the halved grilled chicken soft tacos. I recommend calling ahead if you can, they are often busy."}
{"text":"We were introduced to Mi Pueblo by a friend and were pleasantly surprised by the tasty food. The décor is nothing special, but the food is good. My husband always gets a chimichanga and I love the veggie burrito. They do a nice job with pick up orders-- our food is always prepared and ready when we call ahead."}
{"text":"This our first time trying Make Pueblo, we were in the mood for menudo and decided to give it shot. There's no table service so Upon arriving you place your order at the counter the young girl there seemed a bit off, kinda flustered n I'm not sure why I had to tell her things over n over again n she couldn't get my drink order right..  So I repeated slower n more  precise n she rolled her eyes st and still got it wrong! It was nothing complicated two large drinks one small and large horchata and one large Jamaica anyways the food arrived fairly fast n portion was good. The menudo was decent a bit greasy for me n small bones were mixed in so you'll to be extra careful cause it looked like a tripe. There's a lot of good Mexican places in Phoenix with better service n food so I probably wouldn't go out of my way for this one."}
{"text":"We ordered to pick up for the first time! I used Yelp for guidance on the suggested goodies and also looking at the pictures to decide on our order. My fiancé picked it up and was happy that it was ready at the time promised. When he got home it was still nice and hot! I ordered the chicken enchiladas and regular one to try! My preference was the chicken! Delicious sauce, lots of chicken and the flavor was amazing! My sweetheart had the burrito that looked huge- but gone in a flash!! We will order from there again for sure! Wonderful meals and reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"Great food for about the same price of Filibertos. Hidden behind compass bank, this place has authentic, friendly employees who speak English very well. Mi pueblo is small and intimate which explains why the other customers all seem to know each other and are so easy going.   Without a lot of good places to eat in the area it is nice to find a cheap sit down restaurant where you can feel comfortable eating alone.   Menudo on Friday and Saturday, coke products, and free chips and salsa! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Chile Relleno plate was pretty good here the beans were good the rice was meh. The chips and 2 diff salsa's were good tasted fresh. It didnt take long and Horchata was good! All in all I will stop here again and try some other dishes since its really close to my new pad!"}
{"text":"Not Bad.....Not Bad At All  I was expecting Mi Pueblo Mexican Food to be the typical Mexican fast food. Boy was I wrong.  Mi Pueblo is a step above the rest.  Lets start with the complimentary hot chips and salsa. Many Mex style recipes give you those cheap paper thin tasteless chips but not Mi Pueblo. These chips are lighy, crispy, and flavorful and  salsas are really tasty.  On this visit I ordered the grilled chicken taco plate and I  not  disappointed. The chicken was moist, seasoned, and loaded with flavor. The chicken tacos came with a homemade \"dressing\" not sure what it was. All I know it was really good.  Even though I was completely full from.my meal I couldn't leave without trying dessert.  So I decided to try the  sopapillas which come drizzled with honey and powdered sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side, it was delicious.  Good food, inexpensive meals, and great customer.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Just like some of the other reviews you wouldn't think this place has good Mexican food, its small and busy. But man o man the food wow! Some food stuff. We will be returning to this location. We live in Chandler, but we were heading up to Anthem to shop at the outlets. My wife wanted a place with good salsa and chips. So, I jump on yell looking for \"Mexican food near me\" a few popped up, then I went into the subjects people commented on. And this place everyone mentioned the complementary chips and salsa. So we went. My wife, mother and my 3yr old son. My son lived the rice and beans. My wife loved the rolled tacos and the chimis. Mmmmm.... We will be back. Thanks."}
{"text":"Coming from Southern California with some great Mexican food- I had yet to find a good little spot on my side of town with everything I like- after reading yelp reviews and the menu I tried it- I'm impressed - I ordered both the al pastor street tacos and a green chili pork burrito both of which I requested special and they fulfilled beyond- without any screw ups- both were great and better quality than that of any typical drive thru window establishment- as well as great portioned, I must say it brought back a piece of home- and very reasonably priced - I will continue to go here"}
{"text":"Food was good. All wait staff was really nice. They have 3 house salsas, my fiancé really liked one and I liked another which really worked out for us. They have some unique dishes. The chile rellano was so different and tasted awesome. Corn rice = deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Oh so good!  I get take out from these guys every week or so and have never been disappointed.  I'm a creature of habit and am addicted to their chicken burrito.  My husband loves their twin chimis.  It's a little hole in the wall restaurant with hardly any seating, but they consistently deliver great food which is not something every restaurant can claim."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! The people are so friendly and it just makes me want to support their business even more!  The food is delicious however, it could probably be a little bit cheaper!"}
{"text":"After I had ordered my food I asked if they had a salsa verde (I had wished I had some on the last trip) the host apologized and informed me they did not have a true salsa verde. When he brought out my food there was a small cup of salsa verde, the host informed me that the chef had overheard my question and whipped me up a small batch. Such great customer service and it made my meal that much better. Highly recommend this place, some of the best Mexican food I've had while I've been here and they definitely care about their customers. Wish I could give 6 stars."}
{"text":"The food and service are great!  My husband and I go once a week.  The staff is always very friendly. The food is reasonably priced and is always hot an fresh. They deliver the food to the table in a timely manner. Free all you can eat chips and salsa for dine-in customers. Our only Mexican food joint!"}
{"text":"A nice little place to grab a quick bit to eat. They have a average selection for the menu and the food is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Loved this place for many years! Very nice people working there and great food. Recommend the bean tostado, 6 halves or chimichanga. All delicious!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Great for take out. The carne asada burrito was doused in awesome sauce which made the flavor pop along with the meat, cheese and guacamole."}
{"text":"I have had ordered take out at least a dozen times. Every meal was excellent and they have the best horchata!  My recommendations would be carnitas fajitas, veggie burrito and taco salad. I would suggest you give this place a try and don't forget the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Mi Pueblo is a small place tucked into a strip mall off of 7th St and Union Hills. It has been there for at least 6 years that I know of.   I wanted something Mexican ish for lunch today and needed to try a new place.   I was greeted by a nice girl and looked around a bit. They have 30 combo lunches/dinners pictured on the wall. I did not see any other type of menu. I asked about the Green Chili and she said it was good.   They offer a chip bar with 2 types of salsa and the carrots in hot stuff. LOL The salsa was a fresh tasting red salsa and a roasted chili green type both were good and complimented the chips perfectly.   The burrito was a generous size and was covered in green sauce and cheese with sour cream on the side. The in-nerds were flavorful and plentiful, the pork was tender and nice sized chunks. (I did have one fat hunk) The beans were good and the rice was OK. It tasted like a nutty taste some how. ??   right around $7 and I could not eat it all."}
{"text":"Great food & service!  My husband and I love going there."}
{"text":"Possibly some of the best Mexican food on this side of town. I really enjoy nearly everything on the menu and I am happy with the portion size and the price. They have some really good specials going usually and the atmosphere is nice as well. The service can be spotty at times but when your busy you can come to expect that."}
{"text":"Great service and food!  The one drawback was the size of my fajita burrito. A larger portion size would be better."}
{"text":"This is a little North Phoenix strip mall restaurant with consistently tasty breakfast burritos and great service. I've never waited longer than 5 minutes to get my food after placing an order; super efficient when picking up food to go. Try some chips and delicious homemade salsa while you wait, they do not disappoint."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good.  I'm a super picky eater - and I loved that the take out containers are divided so I didn't have rice and beans slopped all over my chimi like at other places.  Win!   I got a chicken chimi and liked it.  The meat was moist and was cooked with veggies for flavor but there weren't huge pieces of veggies in the chimi, which I liked.  There wasn't a pile of grease in the takeout container - thumbs up.  Service was fast and friendly.  We went at 11:30 or so on a Monday and there were a good amount of people there.  Not suitable for big groups as the dining area is pretty small.  There was a steady stream of take out orders and the dining area was 3/4 full.  We'll be back for sure to try out other things."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time, I love their salsa. My wife always gets the Horchata, very delicious mexican drink that you should try sometime. My favorite dish is the cilantro street tacos. Mostly because I am a huge cilantro fanatic."}
{"text":"Called in an order to pick up on a Tuesday. Staff was really nice. The restaurant is pretty small but has a nice heated chip basket and few different salsas that are complimentary. They have an awesome menu with tons of options and great prices.  I got the enchilada trio which comes with a cheese, chicken, and beef enchilada with all 3 sauces(green, red, &creme). Also came with Spanish rice, refried beans, chips, and salsa. Everything was very good and it was a ton of food! Would be great to split or just have an entire second meal for left overs. The green sauce was my favorite so I may just get green chili enchiladas next time. The salsa was also very good and very fresh. You can tell it's made fresh.   Overall everything was very good for a quick fast food Mexican stop. I will definitely be back and excited to try more things. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Great potato egg & cheese burrito!  Friendly service!  I will have to come some other time when I'm not giving up meat for Lent!  The guy at the register said this place has been here almost 20 years!"}
{"text":"So this was a complete surprise to us! What great food and friendly service. We ordered the fish tacos and they were delicious. Fresh grilled tilapia perfectly seasoned. Also ordered cheese enchilada and crispy shredded beef taco. It is my favorite combo and it was really good. It is not fancy but clean and good casual atmosphere. We have found a new regular place when we are craving Mexican food. And it is very affordable!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! My bf and I go as much as we can. We grew up in an area with tacos trucks every street. And moving to az we struggled to find carne asada tacos we thought were great. And their horchata is so goood as well. Definitely recommend for you to stop in. Food doesn't take long at all to prepare and there's self serve chips y salsa while you wait!!"}
{"text":"I just love this place.  The food is like real sit-down mexican but you can get it pretty fast on the go."}
{"text":"This is a great little Mexican food establishment around the Union Hills and 7th street area. I'd recommend going with the takeout as the seating inside is quite small. The staff inside have always been friendly and accommodating. The orders come out quick and on time.   I've had their beef tacos as well as their carne asada burrito. They were both very tasty and fresh. The portion size is pretty large so expect to have some leftovers! My wife tried their chicken fajitas and said they were quite good as well."}
{"text":"Such good Mexican food... the open faced chicken chimi is delicioso!"}
{"text":"Good food Good prices Friendly staff  It's a small whole in the wall, but that usually indicates it's great or awful.  Mi Pueblo is a win   Nuff said!"}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food I've ever had! look no further and don't even bother with filibertos unless it's on those late drunken nights and Mi Pueblo is closed but if not, choose Mi pueblo! Best enchiladas in town! And the horchata is top notch"}
{"text":"Exellent !!  We will be back..Fresh food,and great taste"}
{"text":"My go to place for Mexican food. Chimichangas, enchiladas and menudo are my favorites . Big portions , decent price."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place STILL! The hard beef tacos  are to die for. I'm ashamed to admit that we've been eating here once a week now. But it's just that good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the quality has recently changed or what the standards of the other reviewers are, but the food was nearly inedible.  I was very excited to try Mi Pueblo based on the other reviews, but the only positive thing I can say is the young man working was polite and professional.  The chips and salsa bar was ok, but nothing special.  The chips were under a heating lamp and not crispy at all, they were warm and chewy.  The salsas were ok, but sat at room temperature.  I ordered the taco plate with two shredded beef tacos.  The taco shells tasted stale, and it was obvious by the dry beef and greasy bottom that they sat prepared under a heating lamp for a while.  The pico and lettuce were also obviously old, and not properly stored prior to serving them.  The rice and beans were just bland.  I am certain the beans were pintos from a can that were mashed a little.  The rice was dry and didn't have any seasoning at all.  If it wasn't  for the color I would have sworn it was plain white rice.  My husband got the chimichanga enchilada style.  It is served with pico de gallo inside, which disappointed him, but that is due to us not being familiar with the menu,  They obviously didn't use a basket to fry the chimi, because the ends were burned,  Again, it must have been sitting for a while maybe days, because it tasted old and the enchilada sauce lacked flavor.  However, the beef was seasoned.  It was a little salty, but at least there was one thing on our plates with some flavor.  I was really looking forward to having a quick and tasty option down the street for dinners on busy nights and an occasional breakfast burrito, but I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix and wanted to find an Authentic Mexican restaurant for lunch. Mi Pueblo was exactly what I was looking for. They have a big photo menu behind the counter which made ordering very easy.  Unlike some other places my Enchiladas came out just like the picture and tasted as good as they looked. Service was very fast and showed a level of professionalism sometimes missing in a family run restaurant."}
{"text":"THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN!   Mi Pueblo has been my favorite Mexican food for years! Forget the chains and the greasy taco places. Mi Pueblo is authentic and fresh tasting. They don't use lard yet their food still tastes so traditional.  It is NOT fancy inside. You order at the counter and help yourself to their delicious hot chips and their zippy fresh salsa. The family that owns the place is so nice. They never mess up an order even complicated ones.   The food is incredible. My husbands favorites include the fish tacos, twin chimis, and the green chili pork. I love the chili relleno, the enchiladas, and the bean tostada. Try them for breakfast too! Huge plates of egg dishes, potatoes, beans and tortillas. Perfect hangover remedy! And I think they serve menudo too!  Everything is reasonably priced. You spend half as much as if you would going to Valle Luna or Macayos and the food is 10x better. We have ordered their party trays before for football parties and for our wedding rehearsal dinner. For under 40 bucks you can get a gigantic tray full of mini tacos, chimis, and quesadillas. They are supposed to feed 8-10 but they are big enough to feed more than that! Mmmmm..."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place for my mexican food cravings. I consider this place a hybrid of fast food mexcian food places. I am sure you have been to the fast food mexican food places like filbertos, jilberts, something\"bertos\", rolondos, etc.  Well, this place isn't like them for a couple of reasons. 1) Their food has more of a restaurant taste to them and 1) They provide chips and real salsa with their food. They also have a little salsa bar that you can use while waiting for your food or if you dine in. The awesome thing is that the prices reflect the cheaper fast food places. I personally like their salsa, but by no means is it my favorite. I sometimes crave the fast food hot sauce, so, I actually go to rolandos or something similar.   The employees are very nice and always have a smile, which is always nice.  Give this place a try if you are interested in trying mexican fast food, but with regular salsa."}
{"text":"Un assuming store, kinda dingy, and small. BUT!!! The food is amazing! As authentic as it gets. I had the taco with enchilda and a quesadilla. WOW!! I could have eaten somethign else too, and I wish I had. Definitly try this palce!!"}
{"text":"We go at least a few times a month.  Small place with serve yourself chips and salsa.  Efficient and pleasant staff.  I love Mexican food, but do not eat meat, so this place is great because it has shrimp and fish - doesn't just limit me to beans.  And it's all good - hubby has tried a variety of dishes, but I love the shrimp tacos!!"}
{"text":"It's after 8 pm and I just finished my lunch from Mi Pueblo! Stopped by on the way home from shopping at this neighborhood hole in the wall restaurant. Lunch time was crowded and since they only have 10 tables we opted for takeout. Standing in line gave us time to see what others were eating and after seeing both the tostada and the grilled chicken salad I thought we might eat healthy. I guess we got confused by the time we got to the counter because \"carnitas fajitas\" popped out of my mouth and my husband ordered beef enchiladas. The food was decent and portions very large. I filled up at lunch and had enough left over for dinner. We were both stuffed and happy with our choices. The meat in both our meals was perfectly seasoned and very tender. Since there was so much, I wish there were more than 3 tortillas. I also enjoyed the rice and endured the beans. I never could figure out why so many people love refried beans. My husband thought they were great!  There was a bag of chips included as well as containers of salsa. Good flavor on the salsa but very watery; the kind you drip all over your good shirt when you are eating in the restaurant :) Prices were reasonable (I had a LOT of food for $10) and the place is clean. Staff was friendly and service was quick. I'll go back."}
{"text":"I walked in, and was greeted with a smile. Unfamiliar with the food, I asked for her recommendations. She had no problem giving me suggestions, and I ultimately went with the fajita burrito and a side of Guacamole. Super friendly staff, good food, and well priced. What more could you ask for? If I lived in the area, this place would be my \"go to\"."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos and fresh salsa. Healthier than most Mexican places.  Food is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I called in our order so I wouldn't have to wait for our food. They said 15-20 minutes so I knew they were cooking it fresh. My order was ready right on time and I used my Yelp check in 10% off coupon. The food was delicious! I got the 2 cream cheese chicken enchiladas with rice and my husband got the 2 green chili beef enchiladas and beans. We both thought the food was very good. A little pricey for take out Mexican but we were both full and happy with the food."}
{"text":"I think I can finally call off the hunt for the delish type of Mexican food I miss from home in Texas.  Simple menu, good prices and freshly made food that left us wanting more.    Our party of three ordered the beef chimi, the cheese enchiladas (no sauce) and the green chicken enchiladas.  At first we'd planned to order our dinner to go - that is until we laid our eyes on the salsa.  So many places just totally lack a good salsa, but this one looked bright and fresh.  It was delicious!  Vibrant and with a little kick, the mild salsa hit the spot.  And the self serve chips were perfect for our table.  The food arrived just in time as we finished up our salsa and chips, and it couldn't have looked more inviting!  We tucked in right away.  There was no conversation - this food was too good for talking!    The place is cozy with only a few tables, but was still comfortable.  Plenty of folks came in and out for take out orders.  Each and every customer was greeted by a friendly guy, and the nifty credit card system even allowed for an emailed receipt instead of printing one out.  Great place that I will absolutely be trying again and again."}
{"text":"Seriously?  How did I miss this place?  I drive by it at least once a day but never stopped in until about a month ago.  It's a small storefront in a strip mall wedged between Bosa Donuts and Goodwill at the corner of Union Hills and 7th St. so it's kind of easy to miss.  Head inside and there are about 8 tables and a menu with photos hung above the register.  Go to the counter, order your food, and the folks there will bring it out to you when it's ready.  In the meantime, you'll get a free basket of chips and you have access to their small but ample salsa bar.  When your food arrive, that's when the magic happens.  Each dish is expertly prepared and presented in a way that rivals your high brow expensive Mexican chains, but with one difference...the place is legit.  No boil in bag garbage or pre made stuff here.  One woman in the kitchen uses her amazing skills to give you traditional, authentic Mexican.  Their quesadillas are out of this world, their street tacos are outrageous, and their enchiladas will leave you at a loss for words.  The best part?  It's so inexpensive.  I feel like I rob them each time I eat there.  For less than $10 bucks you leave stuffed with unbelievable food."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, service is always nice and friendly. Endless chips and salsa. Great little spot no matter breakfast lunch or dinner. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, and really a hidden gem. Salsa is delicious, shrimp tacos were a big surprise as they were excellent (like.. I've never had better). The horchata was the only thing I wasn't over the moon about, but I suspect that's because I've never had real horchata before (just a little too cinnamon-y for me.) Just a really unpretentious, delicious Mexican joint. Be aware space is pretty limited, but they do carry-out. No alcohol either, so keep this in mind."}
{"text":"Good breakfast burritos. Online ordering didn't quite work out as planned - I had tried to call but the lines were busy, then I ordered online and they didn't get it until I walked in. However they were super gracious and got my food to me right away, which was really great customer service. Burritos were really good! Will be back."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a breakfast burrito the other day. Good burrito, nothing special. Place looked clean, staff was nice. Talked for a few and I split"}
{"text":"i love their chimichangas & 6 halves! i don't know why people are saying its not fresh, the only thing they use the microwave for is to melt the cheese, i always watch since i'm super picky with things like that. Their salsa is really good i love the HOT salsa but i love the HOT employees even more, i believe they're brothers. Any ways the employees are super nice and the restaurant is very clean!   & to the lady that's not happy because they don't make home made tortillas, Where in az do you go that makes fresh tortillas? my Mexican grandma doesn't even make tortillas."}
{"text":"I think I want to eat here every day this week. I came in on a slow Sunday night, and wanted to go back on Monday (but I finished my leftovers instead), then Tuesday, and I actually think I might go back tonight to try the Green Chili Chicken Enchilada. I got the Chicken Fajitas plate, and my husband got the tamale and taco combo.  Everything was fresh, not too greasy, and extremely delicious. This is my new quick and easy Mexican food restaurant. Yay!"}
{"text":"The al pastor here was amazing! Initially had some reservations based strictly on outside appearance, but this place is honestly great food. Lastly, prices are super reasonable."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp after going to the outlets in anthem and were on our way back to north Scottsdale. When we got there, we weren't sure we were in the right place. It's in the same shopping center as a goodwill and kind of hidden in the far corner.  Once we found where we were going, we went into the restaurant and we were the only ones in there.    We ordered right away and our food came out relatively fast.  They only have soup on the weekend which was a little disappointing since we went on a Friday night and it was cold, but the rest of the menu was huge. My friend and I both got enchiladas.  They were very very good. The portions were huge and the food was pretty cheap. If you had been at another restaurant we probably would have had a $40 bill, but between the two of us we paid $20.   We both ate until we were stuffed and even then there was food left on both our plates.  It's definitely quite a drive from my house, but the food was good and if I'm in the area again I would definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Had a burrito, but it wasn't very good.  The first half of it tasted like all beans.  The 2nd half was better, but still left a lot to be desired.  I was really hoping I'd like this place because it's so close, but I don't think I'll be back.  When I went, the place was packed full, but I was still served quickly.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"It was ok, they messed part of the order. The inside of the store is hot and cramped, and there is no room at all if more than 10 people are in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay so it is a little hole in the wall and the greasy smell when I first walked in almost made me walk back out BUT I stayed and ordered and I must say that I'm glad that I did!  I ordered the Tres Enchiladas plate which they changed up for me (normally you get one chicken, one beef and one cheese) to just three sour cream chicken.  I also ordered my husband the two chimi (one beef and one chicken) combo plate.  The dinners came with rice and beans and they included chips and salsa in the to go order without having to ask for it...nice touch!  I get home and open my container still a little apprehensive after the smell of the restaurant.   The first thing I notice is the size of the enchiladas.  Wow!  These were the most chicken stuffed offerings I've had from any Phoenix restaurant!  Then I tasted them......oh, they know how to do an excellent enchilada!  They were so flavorful and the sauce was light and creamy.  Totally rocked it!  The beans were also very good.  Full of flavor, nice and sticky firm and not soupy like some places.  Total win.  Only thing that was disappointing was the rice.  It was just there.  Not much taste, bland, boring.  yawn.  Overall it was amazingly cheap and very, very good!  The fact that it's just down the street?  Bonus!"}
{"text":"Not authentic, didn't have a lot of flavor or spice. Very simple dishes and we had  cheese enchiladas, crunchy beef taco and An under cooked chili reyeno. The pepper needed to be cooked more. It was crunchy. We picked the place because of the high ratings but it was very bland. The beans were bland as well. However good Salsa and great service that's why they got a 3star from us."}
{"text":"Despite the promises of tasty Mexican food, this place seemed sooooo mediocre to me! The people are friendly, and the food is cheap, but I'd be willing to pay a bit more for one thing that really lacked in my experience - FLAVOR!  I had the #8 - Taco, chili relleno, rice and beans. It all came out quickly since I had the entire place to myself. However, nothing had a lot of flavor. Every piece of my meal seemed fairly bland. Towards the end it picked up a bit, warranting a bump up to 3 stars, but I just can't go above that."}
{"text":"Let's begin- I ordered online on yelp.  I even special ordered too.  I called to verify just incase it was somehow messed up.  when I picked up, the staff knew who I was and had my food waiting for me.   the food was yummy and I would return again because its affordable and nearby me."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were very enjoyable. The salsa bar was excellent and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly people, nice clean place. Highly recommend!  I got a veggie burro and a friend of mine got a shrimp burro."}
{"text":"Service is very nice. Chimi was a little too deep fried. Burrito was ok. Every bite seemed uneven....Taste was average but still good. Price was good. I'd consider going here again for some easy Mexican food."}
{"text":"I ordered a shrimp burro - they grilled the shrimp, filled it with lots of stuff, and smothered it with a delicious sour-cream type of sauce. The all-you-can-eat chips and salsa are good.  No problem with doing your own refilling, that way you don't waste.  We loved mixing their hot and mild salsa together, and just having a container of each. (we ate in, but I see that they do a pretty good \"take-out\" business as well)  They're close to a water store, so if you need to refill your 5-gallon bottles..."}
{"text":"Food is great and priced very fair. We had 2 different Chimichangas smothered in both sauces, the green chili is especially good.They have serve yourself chips and salsa. This is not a big place but is very clean and the people are always more than friendly. This IS the place for mexican in the area, they have been around for more than a few years from what I understand, and I can see why. There was a special discount when we went for a yelp check in."}
{"text":"I walked into this hole in the wall in a shopping center hoping to find some authentic Mexican food. As I walked in, there was a woman washing tables. I placed my order with a man on the phone clearly having a personal conversation but he paused long enough to take my order. After I ordered, the woman who was washing tables strolled into the back where you can see them prepare the food. She wiped her hands on her dirty apron and reached for a tortilla with BARE unwashed hands I almost walked out right there but was so shocked I just watched in disbelief!! She proceded to slap some ingredients on it from containers rolled it up sprinkled some cheese; still no gloves. The best part; she put it in a styrofoam container and then PUT it in the microwave!! Mouth dropped to the floor after just paying $8.14. I walked out and threw in the trash, so disgusted!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service!!! Very clean, kids love the food.  The salsa bar is very fresh.  The morning staff is very nice.  Food portions are just right."}
{"text":"I was nearby and wanted to find a place to try out. I browsed Yelp and found this place. The name caught my eye because someone mentioned this place recently to me.  This restaurant is small - about eight tables. You go up and order & pay for your food, then find a table. They have real plates and silverware, which is nice.  I had a cheese enchilada with red sauce - home made, not out of a can - and you can tell. I tried both al pastor and carne asada street tacos, which were quite tasty as well.  I would recommend checking this place out! They are friendly as well. I want to try the green sauce - that'll have to wait til next time."}
{"text":"Been here twice, once for lunch and today I tried their breakfast.   They have very friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Salsas are on point and they provide free chips.  Quality spot"}
{"text":"Overpriced and horrible. Bad service , and nasty food... at least the place was clean."}
{"text":"We live just down the street from this little strip mall restaurant.  Why oh why didn't I find it sooner!  I am a very picky eater and sort of a bland eater. They were willing to keep things out or add things to match my odd tastes.  Husband is an eclectic eater and will try anything so we make a good pair.  He was impressed with the enchiladas and the homemade salsa.  I ate a chimi and it was fried to perfection.  Very authentic tastes and great prices.  Houston, we are going to have a diet problem here."}
{"text":"Now that's a good tamale!   It was only one of the three items in my combo - the others were a beef taco and a cheese enchilada. All were tasty, but the tamale (beef-machaca?) took the prize on that plate. Beans and rice were both decent and then I sprinkled on some of the magic dust that was in a shaker on the table. BAM! Awesome spice that seemed to be a mixture of red pepper flakes, chili powder and perhaps a touch of cayenne. Nice. Another sprinkle jar on the table was some nice, fresh Mexican Oregano. All of that was washed down with a full half liter of Mexican Coke. I'm not sure why so many places are now importing Mexi-coke, but I like it. This si the only place I know of that is using the 1/2 liter botles that are returnable.   Once again, this place features Mexi-coke, but offers Pepsi on the fountain for Coca-cola haters. As much as I like Pepsi, I still gotta have the glass-bottled Cokes. I wish more places would also import the Mexi-Pepsi!  Athena had the Chile Relleno, which she said was very good but perhaps could have used a bit more flavoring in the batter.  The salsas were fresh, but as with almost every salsa these days, it has been gringo-ized and could definitely use more kick. The hot isn't that hot, and it's of the chipotle variety. Is it too hard to make some pico de gallo and toss in a bunch of serranos? Heck - just mince up some serranos and offer them on the salsa bar.  One more note: if you are dining in, there are fresh, tasty tortilla chips available under the heat lamp at the salsa bar."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican'ish spot in the north Phx area. Check out the shrimp chimi w/ white sauce"}
{"text":"Stopped in here last night mainly because I was craving tacos. And it was Tuesday after all. Had the little street tacos that are made with pork and onions with a green salsa. Just what I wanted. They were ready pretty quickly. They were tasty. I also had some Horchata which was a good sweet complement to the spicy tacos. Pricing was reasonable. I would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"I stopped in randomly one morning to pick up a few breakfast burritos. Having never been before, I was pleasantly surprised. They had a nice salsa bar and there were a few tables to sit at. My 4-star rating was caused my the fact that the wait time for my food was a bit long.    The burritos were delicious though. Not anywhere near as greasy as the \"bertos\" in the area.    I would definitely go back, if I had a bit of extra time in the morning."}
{"text":"Wait!  You're looking for Mexican food, right? By now you've noticed how so many of them have really bad reviews, right? And the reviews for some of the fancy upscale places (oxymoron?) have reviews that sound like they were written by an ad agency, right? So, are the reviews for this place \"real\" or bogus?  I just discovered my local nirvana Mexican restaurant. Where I came from in SoCal I only had one nirvana Mexican place ... you know, where portions are huge, prices are cheap and the food is drop-dead awesome. And now here in Phoenix I've found my local equivalent, Mi Pueblo. And this review is real.  Mi Pueblo a tiny place about the size of an average living room with a handful of tables for eating there, not fancy but exceptionally clean. It is staffed by locals, no pretensions, no attitude, super friendly.  Prices are excellent and portions are huge. They use REAL ingredients, yes folks they actually care that their food tastes good, which is extremely rare for any Mexican food restaurant in the Phoenix area. PS - some people are hung up on using the word \"authentic\" to describe Mexican food. What is that supposed to mean? Mexico is a big country with lots of regional styles and millions of families who cook their food millions of different ways ... it's ALL authentic!  Another plus is that they have a menu that you can order directly from Yelp and when you arrive to pick it up a few minutes later it is prepaid and ready to go. The only way to roll.  I had a Carne Asada burrito that was almost all meat and had more flavor than you can imagine. One burrito could have been my entire dinner but it was my first time I also ordered a Carnitas Soft Taco as an ala carta side. The Carnitas had immense flavor.  They're located in a well-lighted and relatively safe strip mall with tons of parking. You can order food for pickup between 7 AM and 8:40 PM.  Trivia: they've been in business since 1999 and are family owned ... yaay for not being a chain owned by a corporate monopoly. Besides the Union Hills location they have one more restaurant at Metro Center.  This is now my #1 go-to Mexican food place in town."}
{"text":"Great customer service, but it's not quite what I was hoping for. I was hoping for a super burrito with sour cream, pico degaio, onions, rice in the burrito."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I chose  this restaurant  on the go in our car. We,were hungry and picked the closest  Mexican restaurant  with good reviews. This is a small shopping center business. It was crowed, but we went in . We were not disipointed at all. We will be back."}
{"text":"I loved that there were multiple vegetarian options. I ordered the vegetarian burrito, which was very tasty. There was even spinach inside! Next time I would order it dry instead of enchilada style as I did not care for the mushy tortilla. I would eat here again if in the area and craving Mexican fare.   Pros Fast service with a smile Very fresh ingredients Authentic Mexican flavors Open for breakfast, lunch & dinner  Chip & salsa bar Options, including vegetarian Great prices for large portions  Cons Crowded - but that's a good sign! Tortillas not ideal for enchilada sauce"}
{"text":"Being from a Hispanic background, it's hard for me to go to restaurants and order food I've eaten homemade my whole life. That being said, the food was great!! I had a carne asada burrito combo. The burrito was done enchilada style and the sauce was flavorful without being spicy. The rice was cooked to perfection and tasted just like it came from my Nana's kitchen. Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced. 10/10 I would DEFINITELY order again!"}
{"text":"Really fresh, tasty Mexican food. Friendly staff, very reasonably priced, great salsa."}
{"text":"Lovely little place with good service and tasty, authentic Mexican cuisine.  Highly recommend.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Very good, quick Mexican food!  I liked the salsa bar they offer.  Great place to also go to for take out.  I'm new to the area, so stopped based on location & reviews, only item to note...they don't have a liquor license so no margaritas, by no means a deal breaker, but just be aware.  Will definitely return & when I want my margarita will do take out & do my bevi's at home...which is always cheaper, so a win-win!"}
{"text":"Only place in the valley that serves fresh and authentic Mexican food. The food is delicious, and they've even got fresh salsa! They have a wonderful, friendly staff. I won't go anywhere else for Mexican food."}
{"text":"If you missed lunch  and you're too hungry to wait for dinner, go to Mi Pueblo. At 4pm, I got the 6 half chicken tacos and they hit the spot. Muy Rico! The interior is exactly as you would expect in a old strip mall joint. But you're not here for the ambiance. It's the food and it's good and the price is right.  I'll make a point to come back at a proper lunch time. I bet it gets packed."}
{"text":"Potato & Eggs plate was alright, searing hot tortillas in that foil, and the hotter salsa was tasty.  Seemed like a buck or two high for what it was, a little breakfast plate & soda running about $8.  Nice ambience and friendly staff.  Food alright."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican restaurant. Stopped here for lunch today and I'm sure we will be back soon.  Very yummy California Burrito and the salsa was so fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"First time here. Also one of my first reviews. This place was actually really good. Great salsa bar with hit chips. I had the #13 steak fajitas, $8.99. Girlfriend had the #12 sour cream chicken enchiladas. Horchata was pretty decent. We both really enjoyed our meals. Pros- tasty, cheap, quick, salsa bar. Cons- kinda dingy. Overall- give this place a try! Its worth it"}
{"text":"Not a place I would drive miles to go to but a good place if your in the neighborhood.  Just wish the food had a little more kick to it."}
