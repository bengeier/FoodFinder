{"text":"Went here on a late night...for food possibly drinks I called ahead to make sure there kitchen was open (considering the bar is and most places kitchens close early) I was told that they closed at 2am. I got there and the bartender acted as though she didn't want to seat us..wen were finally seated..the server came out and was really nice and very persistant about checking on us..our food was ready in abt 10 mins I ordered the philly cheesesteak with curly fries. When I bit into it and got a closer look the meat was literally GRAY n looked undercooked!!.not only was it gray it was tasteless. It looked like some cartoon $**T. to insult to injury they started closing down 10 mins till 1??? Seriously wtf lights were flickering on and off...Trust me if u can help goin to this place to at late night or not DON'T DO IT 2 URSELF!! The BEST thing about the place was the server he was great! Didn't go as far to have drinks because they closed earlier than they said they did. SHITTY SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Seating inside and out. Has a bar but also has an area where under age kids can enjoy themselves. Family oriented"}
{"text":"Super trashy place but hands down best ribs and BBQ sauce I have ever had in life. Rubs are worth it even though there may be roaches in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Pretty rough zone. Wings are mutant style and clearly were frozen for at least 3-4 years before being fried to order. Better off eating Wendy's."}

OK GUYS IV READ THESE REVIEWS AND LIKE I SAID , YOU CANT MAKE EVRYONE HAPPY,  BUT ME?  I AM !      tHANKS FOR MAKING US HAPPY CUSTOMERS!  SEE YA SOON."}
{"text":"I like to go here on St Patricks Day or maybe just a random weekend to drink, but the food is terrible so, if you do go, make sure you're full. The service is good, though."}
{"text":"Ok so i'll just get to the point, I hate long reviews. basically we got EXPIRED beer from 2008...YES IT EXPIRED JANUARY 2008!!!!!!, (that's probably why when she brought it out to us she was like \"wow it was all the way in the back\") I still need to post the picture. But the server laughed when we brought it to her attention and the owner/manager who ever that guy is came out too and he just looked at it the beer, and said nothing. No apology, nothing. This place sucks worse every time I go. I won't be going back. Lucky they have that patio, that's probably the only reason they stay in business."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. We went here on a Sunday evening after a comedy show. The waitress was sweet as pie, but the owner, calling in from home had her over charge us for our margarita's. The menu stated there was a special on them. But somehow from home he was remotely going over transactions. She apologized profusely and offered to pay for the difference on her own. It was just a bad experience after such a great evening prior to walking into this place. We'll never go back."}
{"text":"Good deal on craft beer bottles during happy hour.   Menu seems standard for a sports bar -- too much of an emphasis on fried foods for this day and age -- but the chicken sandwich turned out to be very good."}
{"text":"I work near Pacers and have ordered food many times for carry out. The food is best described as bland and underwhelming. they do the bare basics of cooking. If you're just going for a beer and getting fried food (onion rings, etc.), you'll be fine. But don't expect much if you're ordering anything else. Every time I've ordered a chicken dish (sandwich, etc.) it's been overcooked and dry. The last straw were short and curly hairs stuck in the cheese on a sandwich."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to give a less than stellar review to a local business. I've been here several times and, simply, the food has never stood out to me. For this sort of pub food, there's just other places I'd prefer to go.

The location is perfect; right in the center of Lakewood with an incredible patio. Happy hour drinks are a good deal, and they make a good margarita on a hot day.

All in all, Pacer's is a great place to have a beer and watch a game, but for dinner, you might want to try another place."}
{"text":"Lol this place really sucks.... I cant even write a serious review.  Bartender was fun but this places needs to be in a bar rescue episode stat. Its in a prime location and has a great patio, what a shame.

I drank a sip of my warm blue moon only to dry heave as it tasted spoiled, never thought i would say that......... Then i ordered a rum and coke, watered down of course. OH! and the bar food.... Is a joke, im not even mad! There were more waiters than customers and the dude who brought my food felt the need to rearrange the fries with his bare hands in front of me.... I guess to make it look nice. 

Anyways, unless you are going to drink cheap beer and get plastered, do yourself a favor and head over to one of the many other options along detroit. Also this is probably the only bar that still uses a reciever and cd/cassette combo."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant with a pretty wide range selection of food.  Great staff and service is quick.  If you want to go solo here, you can sit at the bar, order food and watch several different sport channels.  Wings are phenom here too and have a wing special Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.  Prices are pretty good on other menu items."}
{"text":"I have to preface this by saying that I went here in a group of 12 so I'm willing to say that this might slightly explain why we had a less than perfect time here. 

The good news:  Food is very reasonably priced (there was a special where you got a salad, some steak and a side for $12) and the selection is decent. Nothing amazing but it's your typical American bar food and the Cajun curly fries were quite tasty.  Everyone was fairly pleased with their food and the pizza looked really good. The beers are big and reasonably priced, as well. You can get a solid meal here for a good price.  Lots of TV's around the place and I got good service when I was sitting at the bar before dinner.  It's a big place and the vibe is casual, which fit out needs for the night. There was a huge TV at the end of the bar which made watching any game very pleasant. 

The bad news: The food is really nothing special. I won't be craving it any time soon. It gets the job done but don't expect anything unique. Our waitress simply would not pay us any attention whatsoever. I get that when you have a big group, things take a while. I also get that places can be understaffed. But we all arrived and decided what we'd like to eat fairly quickly, like within 20 minutes. Yet about 45 minutes after we sat down, we actually had to go find out waitress. My friend literally had to follow her for a minute to get her attention then asked her to come take our orders. We had the same issue getting checks.. Nobody had ordered another round or more food, we had all asked for boxes or finished up.. so why would you make us track  you down to get our checks? 

We had a good time but I wasn't terribly impressed with the place. I would consider going back with a group, maybe, but only if we didn't really have anywhere to get to any time soon and I'd keep my fingers crossed that we get a better waitress next time."}
{"text":"Wings were great, but the rest of the food was terrible. Atmosphere seemed pretty low class. Was not impressed, and probably will not return anytime soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a horrible experience here.  Over priced.  Burned.  And worst of all....a sandwich straight out of my elementary schools cafeteria.  And the dinky sizes of sliced meat, I'm pretty sure, from the middle school.  Not a fan of the 'just add water' mashed potatoes, either."}
{"text":"When I was in college I never went to Pacers in Lakewood because that's where the old people went. Now I realize I am one of those old people and took my first trip there. 
They have a great huge patio and even when it started pouring rain, we were fine because there is a big overhang. 
The server was really sweet and nice and that always helps enjoy a fun night out with friends. 
The food is typical bar. I had a nice salad, the bread was crappy and stale, but I shouldn't eat bread anyway, right?
The weirdest part was they have the tiniest little shot glass size wine glasses. They are silly small. Like they accidentally ordered the glasses for wine flights instead of regular wine glasses. Also strange, they have a $189 bottle of champs on the menu. That was weird too. No way anyone has ever ordered that. 
Second weird part is the bathroom is outside the restaurant in the office building. And was disgusting. I won't go into details, but luckily I had eaten before I went."}
{"text":"I didn't think ordering a hamburger would be so difficult.   I came here to get a bite to eat.   They had a lunch special going on for burgers.   She asked me what I wanted on the burger so I told her ketchup mustard pickle and onion.   She told me they do not put ketchup or mustard on burgers, and that it would be. 40 extra for the onion.   I just don't understand what is so simple has to be turned into a monumental task.   I wasn't asking for outrageous request just basic stuff that comes on a burger.  Never again."}
{"text":"Been going to Pacers for years is it a great restaurant maybe not,but its consistent the food has always been good or better then most bar food I have had. Prices are reasonable and service is fairly good. The patio is great and it's been around for a long time so they must be doing something right. Just yesterday my wife and I shared a number of appetizers they were all very good."}
{"text":"I went to Pacers for lunch and honestly didn't think it was bad at all considering the inexpensiveness of the meal. I had the fish sandwich with cajun curly fries. The portions were large, cooked well, and although it wasn't the best fish sandwich I ever had, I was completely satisfied and felt that I got more or less what I paid for. I see the place only has 2.5 stars but I would not mind coming back based on my first experience; the service was friendly, the outdoor seating is pleasant, and the food is quite alright for the price point."}
{"text":"Rude bartender.  6 people in the place on a late Tuesday night near midnight and he said he needed my credit card to start a tab.  Seriously??  Came for the wings special.  I think they are harvesting baby chicks here for their wings.  They were the smallest wings I've ever seen.  Bartender rushed us the whole time.  I would never, ever go back.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Nice little spot to chill and play some keeeno.. It's open, airy, good food and nice bartender. If your looking for some where to pass a lil time- this is a good spot- they have lottery machines & pool tables and a nice outdoor patio..never had a bad experience here - it's Lakewood's ( better than Panini's) - Panini's"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is meh, but the BBQ is fantastic. Best ribs!"}
{"text":"A good place to watch sports (there is always a television in your line of sight. Always). Food is cheap and standard fare bar food. I tried the ribs once and they were great. You can get a pitcher of beer for cheap as well. 

This place reminds me of a ma and pop Applebees for some reason."}
{"text":"This place makes a great alternative to chain sports bars (cough bdubs cough). Their sample platter is huge, their wings are great, and their full menu is also very tasty. They tout their award winning ribs, which are also the best you can get in Lakewood.

Bar prices are very reasonable, and like the other reviewer said, great place to watch the browns lose."}
{"text":"Fun place to have a few beers anddddd keno! They have pretty good chicken wings.. Typical bar food a little below par... The crowd here can be a bit rough around the edges but always a fun time"}
{"text":"I gotta say, I have a soft spot for this place. First of all, it's the closest bar to my apartment. Trust me, I did a Google Maps search, so it's official. You won't find sushi made fresh that day or hummus that will blow your student-loan-payin' mind, but that's like complaining that White Castle doesn't have any vegan options. It's a sports bar, serves you big-ass beers while you watch sports or shoot the shit, and their burgers and sandwiches (especially the roast beef) are hella good. That's right, I said \"hella.\""}
{"text":"Slowwwwwww service, food not very good. Thumbs down on this one!!"}
{"text":"Boy someone is busy paying people from all over the country for fake reviews and tips.  Amazing how people only write one review and its about THIS place!  (look under not recomended reviews).  Small world huh?!  Food is pretty good and servers are sweet.  Dont eat the fries and vegetables on the side.  Every time they are freezer burned.  The menu is so vast that half the stuff probably sits in a freezer for ages.  This isnt Jersey where huge, diner menus and high volume mean fresh food.  Simplify the menu and lose the dead weight playa.  I dont sit on the patio cuz im not a pompus douche but it is big.  Great beer specials and daily food specials but owner dude should stop playing the rookie game and making fake reviews....makes ya look like a big giant turd...  OPA!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the Browns lose."}
{"text":"This place would get 2 stars from me if it weren't for their outside seating.  Typical bar food, not too shabby.  If you want something quick and run-of-the-mill, stop on by.  I love coming here in the summer though and eating outside.  Beyond that this place is pretty typical.  Not a must-see, but not bad either."}
{"text":"$5.99 Lunch Specials are a really good deal.  I got the burger and fries, and sat at the bar and watched T.V. on my lunch break.  Big burger, lots of fries.  It was good!  They do carry out too.  Worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"Below is my original review and you will also see a comment from the management at pacers. I thought I should point out how inappropriate and poorly written his response was. I am not a competitor I am simply a neighbor who lives a block away and knows that the food here is absolute garbage. His response alone should show you what kind of staff they have at this 1 star hole in the wall sorry excuse for a restaurant. Like my review says below.... This is Lakewood and good food is easy to find, save yourself from terrible food and unprofessional management and head down the street. 

Garbage food, ribs are the specialty and they are hard as a rock and smothered in a terrible pastey BBQ. This place is in Lakewood which has hundreds of amazing restaurants so don't waste your time on this shanty and head down the street for amazing eats."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday at 11:00pm, yet you'd think by the reaction of the bartender and servers that it was 2:00am last call.  

Stopped in for some drinks with a group of 15. You'd think a bar would want some steady business on a Saturday night? Negative. Male bartender was rude right off the get go, as if we were a nuisance for him even though it wasn't very busy. 

Pacers is an overall nice sports bar with good food and beer at a decent price, but I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I am joining Yelp just to write this review.  The food was gross, every time I think about it I feel like puking.  While we were eating there all I kept thinking about was how this would be a great restaurant for that show \"Restaurant Impossible\"  where they come in and fix things up to the way they should be.  It seems this was probably a really cool place back in the 80s but everything is still the same as it was then, including the menu.  They really need to freshen things up a bit, make them more contemporary.  The menu was a bunch of fried appetizers, sandwiches, burgers and ribs.  Nothing fancy, nothing that would ever make me want to return.  The only good thing about the place was the patio.  It's located right on Detroit rd. so there is plenty of people watching to be done. I would go back only to sit on the patio and drink a few drinks, thats about it....ever."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here, but I think that had very little to do with the actual restaurant and more to do with the people I was with.  The drink selection is decent but nothing to write home about, and the food is passable.  I cannot foresee myself thinking \"Man, I really need some overcooked pub food right now.\"  Well, I can at certain times, but that's besides the point.

The saving grace for Pacers is the patio.  It is a nice place to sit and ingest a meal while watching an Indian's game.  However, if there were another patio within walking distance of my place, I would probably end out there instead.

I didn't have an overtly bad experience at Pacers, but don't expect a whole lot."}
{"text":"I love the ceilings of Pacers. It reminds me of a stained glass ceiling of a train station. Pacers holds a special place in my heart because I was raised on the street that Pacers happens to be on. When my relatives would come from Buffalo and Louisville to celebrate birthdays, Pacers was the choice many times. I thought it was fancy as a child. Most dudes who grew up in Lakewood got their first job at age 16 at MPI (Midwest Publishing Inc) in this monolith called Lakewood Center North with Pacers as the anchor. The restaurant/bar was a favorite of the telemarketing crowd. I have always enjoyed the wings. They are usually the bitty kind, and gross me out the least. I don't like it when wings are huge and remind me that I am eating some poor chicken's leg. Also, the big ones have larger veins on the oval wing pieces and that can get to be overwhelming. The patio of Pacers is also one of the best in Lakewood. A lot of kids used to bike and skateboard around the outside on the weird concrete structures and smoke pot in the little pit in front. The \"man\" has shut that down. The restaurant just makes me think about better days I suppose. The food is not really mind blowing or anything."}
{"text":"I tried this place again due to it was close to the house and I wasn't feeling good. I ordered the special which was $3 appetizers. The waitress returned to say I had to order a alcoholic drink to get the special. After examining the sign for the special I did not find any such rule. This place is terrible and I'm never returning. We then left after paying for the 1 soda we ordered to have the dumb owner to chase us down asking if we paid. Yes, we paid our bill. What a joke. I don't see this place lasting too much longer. I guess he forgot there's a Quake & Steak down the street. I will spend my hard earned money there."}
{"text":"I have been taking my family here regularly for the past 10 years.  If you like basic bar and grill food and don't care for chain restaurants, you'll like Pacers.  The setup of the place is a  quirky in numerous ways but I like it way better than Quaker steak or those places that put rosemary on their bar fries and don't serve anything but craft beers.Whenever we have had bad service, that server was not there the next time we went and bathrooms are clean whenever we go (afternoon and evening).  Recommend you stick to bar food basics since it is a bar:  extra hot wings extra crispy, blue moon burger add bacon, jalapeño poppers,  steak fries and curly fries both good.  Grab the 5$/10$ cash straight off your bill coupons available online and in the mailers."}
