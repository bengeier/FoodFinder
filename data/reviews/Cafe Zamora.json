{"text":"im a sucker for chicken fajitas and this place is great. not too expensive either"}
{"text":"My all time favorite Mexican food restaurant (and I'm a native folks). Hefty, no frills Sonoran-style food. The chips and salsa are addicting and the prices beyond reasonable. When you're craving for enchiladas smothered in melted cheese and a serving size that practically spills over the sides of your plate, this is the place."}
{"text":"Had the #28 plate and was rely looking forward to a great tasting dish based on the reviews of their carnitas... but sadly I was disappointed. The meat was extremely greasy and lacked flavor. The dish it self did not look appetizing. Up side: The waitress was very energetic and so was the manager of the establishment."}
{"text":"The food tastes stale. Strange flavoring. We decided to try this place after seeing it on yelp. Big mistake. We left our plates barely touched."}
{"text":"I don't know if we came on an \"off\" night or not, but our food was just BAD.  All of it.  I ordered the chicken chimichanga, which was loaded with dark meat chicken that tasted \"off\", and was very bland.  The rice and beans had been put under the broiler for too long - the rice was hard and beans were burned around the edges.  The guacamole was good.  My boyfriend ordered two carne asada tacos and two carnitas tacos.  All of the meat was WAY overcooked (like jerky) and there was zero seasoning.  Very bland.  Some had tomatoes, some didn't.  Some had cheese, some didn't.  Seemed like store bought tortillas.  We also ordered a beef tamale, which was SO over-warmed it was as hard as a rock on one side and was the dryest, most flavorless tamale I've had in my life.  The chips and salsa were good, and the people who worked there were nice.  The dinner was just terrible.  It was my one \"cheat\" day off my diet and I was so excited to try it, based on the reviews.  Soooo disappointed!  We won't be back.  I'm giving two stars only because the staff was very nice/polite."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place been eating here for years there  juicy fajitas delicious! Every time im on tha west side I have to make a stop at cafe Zamora"}
{"text":"They have some of the best beans that I've tasted. The lemonade reminds me of being in Mexico and having it freshly squeezed. Their chimichanga Burrito is my favorite...."}
{"text":"Not the best in the valley, but definitely the best in Avondale. They have a large menu selection, excellent chicken tacos, and very good customer service. I always make it a point to recommend others."}
{"text":"Any time I have out of town visitors who want \"real\" Mexican, I take them here. The chips are fresh, the salsa is divine, and after downing two baskets, you realize you need to eat an entree! I've eaten a variety off the menu, and nothing has disappointed me. The burros are stuffed full, the crisps are mouthwatering and the enchiladas melt in your mouth. The ONLY downside is the location. Just not a great part of town, though they are trying very hard to revitalize it. Go there anyway! Just try lunch time first."}
{"text":"This place is not very posh, but the food is pretty good. The chips and salsa are great. The service is quick and friendly.  My only complaint is this: Steak Fajita Burrito. How do you not know what this is? Every time, I have to explain what is in it. Shame."}
{"text":"Favorite place for Mexican food in AZ, hands down. You don't have to agree with me, but I like to think being a native gives me some extra street (taco) cred. I could drink their salsa by the gallon. No joke. Their food is nothing revolutionary, just Sonoran Mexican food served next to big gulp size horchatas and swimming in cheese. Ride or die. Doesn't hurt to hit the panaderia across the street for a take home dessert, either."}
{"text":"This is an excellent hole-in-the-wall type mexican place. The food is great and the service is wonderful. Check it out if you like real mexican food and good salsa."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Avondale period,the salsa and chips  is real good also try the open cheese crisp with quaqamole and red chili burrito and there sweet tea is the bomb"}
{"text":"Food is good but i mainly go just for their hot salsa. Seems like everytime i go and buy just salsa, the pricy is different every time and sometimes they give chips and sometimes they dont!! Today got salsa and for the first time it was NOT good just tasted like pure tomato."}
{"text":"We Oregonians wandered in hungry after a long day traveling and were not disappointed. The chile relleno's,  smothered in a delicious green sauce, was excatly what we were hoping for in good Arizona Mexican food!  We loved the warm homemade chips, tasty salsa and the crispy tacos. Mucho Gracias for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"This is a local eatery on Avondale's Western Avenue where there a few Mexican restaurants. This place is not fancy at all - and if someone drops money into the jukebox - it can be pretty noisy. But, the food is good.  We had a beef torta (sandwich) and a chicken torta.  Very good and we would return as they have a pretty extensive menu. Was interesting to see couples entering this establishment and strike up a conversion with other patrons.  This is truly your neighborhood establishment with excellent service.  If you like Mexican food - it is worth a try."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of positive things about this place, but I was thoroughly disappointed. I got food poisoning, and their food was bland. Their Chile Relleno was an over cooked chile omelet. It had no flavor.  The service was great, but that's all thrown away when their food forces you to spend the rest of the day in the rest room.  By far the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten..."}
{"text":"Your classic Mexican restaurant where decor and atmosphere are non existent and the food does the talking."}
{"text":"Had 2 enchiladas plate. One chicken and one beef. Chips and salsa were tasty. Chips were crispy! Enchiladas were yummy too. Corn tortillas we're definitely homemade and made the meal. Beans and rice were just average. Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The drinks are huge, the food is very delicious, prices are excellent, and the salsa is amazing! Warm chips too! Been going here for years and I've ALWAYS been satisfied!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews I finally decided to give this place a try. The service was horrible, the waitress we initially had wasn't seen after we were served our drinks. Then waited about 15 min to have another waitress take our order and once the order was placed it took a while to get our food which was the ultimate disappointment. There was nothing authentic about this place. I'll never be returning."}
{"text":"A great little Mexican  restaurant hidden in old Avondale. There food is good and there chips are fresh. A very casual place to eat. The service is always quick. They have big tables for large groups and just a good place to share a meal with a group of family or friends"}
{"text":"I remember ordering off the menus as a kid with my family & being able to pick anything I want! I feel like I've tried everything & know what I want right when I walk in! It's all so delicious & satisfying! You will never find chips & salsa like Cafe Zamoras!"}
{"text":"First time here on a recommendation and this place sucked. First the water was not drinkable it tasted like crap. The meat in the burrito was some strange cubed meat. I will not come here again.  Taco Bell would have been better"}
{"text":"Best chips & salsa around! Have tried a few different items and all have been delicious. I especially loved the shrimp caldo,  it is bomb.com."}
{"text":"Awful. Not sure if it was an off night or what but it was seriously the worst Mexican food I've had.   A group of four of us came in hoping to experience all the amazing food everyone else has raved about, however out of four of us one was satisfied and only mildly so- and he got a quesadilla which is pretty tough to make poorly.   The rest of us order beef tacos, carnitas burrito and some sort of shrimp dish- which was in a puddle of butter and oil surrounded by over cooked beans and dry rice. Beef tacos had to be reorder since the first batch had a long dark hair in it. When a hairless plate of tacos was brought they were bland, little seasoning (the waitress laughed and apologized but didn't offer a discount or something for the violation of health codes). The carnitas burrito was a flour tortilla which tasted like one bought at frys filled with fried shredded pork with no seasoning besides oil. There was nothing else in the burrito besides the oily fried pork, which we had to drench in the table salsa to make it somewhat edible. Went home feeling quite gross after eating some of the burrito, like the feeling you have after eating a massive McDonald's meal.  Will not be be coming back which is really sad since All the other reviews make this place sound like a gem, also as a new person living in avondale I was hoping to find awesome locally owned restaurants, this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Pretty darn yummy. I must say for being a small place the food was good good.  Everything tastes delicious. I would definitely come back when ever I'm in AZ.  Enchilada was on point and the shredded beef crispy taco was bomb.  I'm so full so come on an empty stomach.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I have been to this facility at least a dozen times over the past year. My girlfriend brought me here and I've had nothing but the best quality in service, food and over experience. The waitresses are absolutely fantastic, the food is mind blowing and the iced tea is fantastic! Best place to eat virtually any meal"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 20 years! The best restaurant my entire family agrees on. Ceviche is perfect, carnitas plate is best ever. Fresh made salsa and pico."}
{"text":"Tried this place again, after several years, and it was much better. While I didn't try the fajitas, I did notice they now give you an option for dry or \"juicy\" fajitas. When we went the first time I didn't have that option and they served me juicy.  Today I had the taco combination and it was really good. The chips and salsa are very good also. The staff was very friendly and we had good service.  Will eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"Food is average at best. Service good. The irritating thing is that they don't give you a bill to look at, you go up to the counter and they fumble through all the bills on the desk to find yours and then they calculate the bill on a calculator, by memory. They type so fast you don't know if it's correct and then they tell you what you owe. There is no way to know if your getting ripped off, by accident I would hope, because if you ask for the paper they wrote your order on you have to get a menu to see the pricing and that may not match what they write because the prices aren't on the paper either. Bad business practice."}
{"text":"Cafe Zamora is my go to place for Bean Burritos. They are so delicious that we will order a few for lunch and then a few for dinner. Not really a part of the city I get to often so it is a real treat that never disappoints. We have had alot of the menu and it is very solid across the board with very pleasant and efficient service. Ask for the hot salsa if you want to bump up the heat a little bit. It is the small bottle on a few tables."}
{"text":"My best friend told me about the green chile burrtios. Told me that they taste like my Aunt Theresa's green chile. The food was good, so now my daughter and I will be coming here for green chile. Even though I can do it myself I still like to taste others too. Salsa needs some work. It has to much tomato taste and not enough chile, or garlic. The hot sauce needs to be lighted a little, too much crushed chile and enough spices."}
{"text":"Me and my wife have been going here for about 6 months now... This is our go to Mexican restaurant in Avondale since we moved here.. They have very good green chile, beans and even the seafood items are very good. We've tried almost everything and it's fantastic! The cafe is very casual, clean and the waitstaff is always very friendly and fast. The food always comes out hot and fast.. for a good homestyle Mexican food experience try Cafe Zamora You'll Love It!"}
{"text":"Very good food, the best I've had in awhile. Their salsa is AMAZING, if anything you have to try this place just for that. They had great service too. Our food came fast and they were quick with drink and chips and salsa refills. Overall great and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and had amazing flavor, the carne asada is delicious and authentic. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant isn't what I expected. I read the most recent reviews on Yelp before going so I thought \"yay, some good food.\" It wasn't good at all. I ordered the chicken enchiladas. The chicken was dry, the sauce most likely came out of a cheap can, the rice was tasteless and dry, the cheese on the beans was questionable. Overall the only thing I did enjoy was their lemonade. I could've made my entire meal in my kitchen and it would've came  out a whole lot better."}
{"text":"Authentic home cook food, but the lengua was better than anyone in my family could make."}
{"text":"We went in on a Friday night at the suggestion of a co-worker. Not the best suggestion he's ever given and I have doubts about taking his suggestions again. The place wasn't that busy, but the service was super slow. We arrived around 6 and didn't leave until almost 7:45. That's way too much time for dinner especially when you have a toddler with you. Not worth the 30 minute drive from my house."}
{"text":"Consistently fantastic Mexican food. I want to try something new, but the carnitas is so damn good."}
{"text":"This place has really great food. Authentic Mexican food with great flavor my 2 complaints are the service (workers never around and grumpy) and for some reason this food always makes me and my husband sick. Don't get me wrong we thoroughly enjoy it but the sickness we have afterwards not so fun.... We eat a lot of Mexican food so I'm wondering what they put in it that makes us feel so crappy after we eat eat there."}
{"text":"We stopped in again yesterday for a late lunch/early dinner. We did it again where we got there in the hour where lunch specials are over and dinner specials haven't started. Its fine though because my boyfriend got a combination plate (three tacos, rice, beans for $8) and I got an egg and bean burrito ($3.75), rice ($2) and beans ($2). Once again, it was very filling and I regretted only that I'd ordered a little too much."}
{"text":"The salsa was amazing. Everything seemed like it was made on site.  The green burro was good and the carnitas was excellent. The restaurant was clean and our waitress was very pleasant. My only complaint was that the taco was flavorless. The meat was tender but lacked in flavor. Overall I liked it and will be back."}
{"text":"I have written a bad review of this poor excuse for a Mexican restaurant before.  I went again today with friends who wanted to go.  I had  the #1 lunch special.  It came with a tostado and an enchilada.  I ate the tostado which had no taste.  It had a VERY thin smear of refried beans, a good inch of lettuce, and less than a teaspoon of grated cheese.  I tasted the rice and left it.  The enchilada was disgusting.  It had even less cheese inside than the tostada had beans.  I have literally been popping Tums since I got home.   While we were sitting there, some kind of huge black bug fell on one of the ladies.  I am not sure how we even stayed at that point.  About ten minutes later, a lady at a table near us got up to kill a big bug under a nearby table with her shoe.   ugh ugh ugh    At noon there were only 3 tables with guests.  What does this tell  you????  This was my third try and my last.  I was hoping I would see what the few people that posted good was actually true.  It is just nasty there."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa in all of Phoenix. This restaurant has been my favorite since moving here from East L.A.  The Carnitas are in point; the Carne Asada fries are on point. The cheese enchiladas are like the kind my grandma made."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of time and it's an ok place. The Mexican food is ok, I usually get the burros but if you want rice and beans and other ingredients inside its a 50 cent charge per item... Really?  The chips and salsa are good. I've also tried some of their ceviche tostadas and these are not fish these are shrimp ceviche, not the best I've tasted by far. Overall, I'd expect better from a hole in the wall but this place is just ok."}
{"text":"This place is great compared to other mexican restaurants nearby. The portions are fairly large and have a home cooked flare loaded with flavor. This not a commercial mexican restaurant which i love. In other words, all the food is prepared, not processed. I immediately noticed the rice and beans were cooked the good ol' fashioned way. The chips and salsa you get while waiting are another nice touch. Their salsa is honestly the best salsa i had the pleasure of waiting with while my food was being prepared. As for the menu items, I prefer the steak (ribeye) & eggs for breakfast....very savory, very juicy! This is a mom and pop style place so if interior decorations are a must have, then cafe zamora is not your spot. 5 stars for food, friendly service, and approproate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Some of the best Carnitas I've had! & a big thing for me and Mexican food is the rice and beans and there's were on point."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Came to a meeting and stopped by before for a quick bite and I will travel to Avondale for this authentic fresh Mexican food.  I had a carnita taco and a carne azada taco with cilantro onion and lime!  Yum! Best ever! My fav hole in the wall officially!  And YES! They have chiles torreados!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food.  Came here for lunch before a Reds spring training game in Goodyear - this place is about 3 miles east of the ballpark.  Above average sonoran fare at very modest prices in a two star setting.  Most lunches were $7-$8.  Not completely Americanized with globs of yellow cheese covering everything - but nothing really special, either.  I like the fact that each person in your party is provided their own little cup of salsa to accompany the freebie chips.  The dining area is utilitarian and a bit dim.  Put a buck or two in the juke box - it livens up an otherwise depressing space.  The general area is spotty and would avoid it after dark.  Don't know if someone did not timely show up for their shift - but at 11:30 am on Tuesday there was one completely overwhelmed girl trying to wait/bus about 10 tables.  We sat unacknowledged for about 15 minutes - and the service did not improve after that.  By 12:15 pm additional help had arrived but the place was basically cleared out by then.  Wish I could give this place a better review as I like low-key local family-run joints - but don't think I will be back.  Side note:  the panderia one block west looked intruiging as did the bakery across the street from the restaurant."}
{"text":"My family took us here while we were visiting as they know my husband's love affair with Mexican dives.  They definitely scored on this one.  I even liked it!    Their burros (basically wet burritos) were huge.  The guacamole was fresh and delicous.  The salsa was a little too watery - but we fixed that with the addition of the pico de gallo our server brought out for us.    Their special spicy salsa is delicous too!    Everything was very good and definitely family-style.  Service was a little slow, but it wasn't bad considering we had great company to enjoy.  I'd definitely recommend it if you're craving some authentic Mexican home-made-style food and you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Extremely upset with the quality of service today! This is a family favorite, and I can't for the life of me understand why. After waiting for an hour for our food we began to question if our order was even in. When we spoke to our waiter her response was snippy- she stated that they just received a large catering order and were working on it. Funny because we were the the only party beside the couple sitting next to us and we've all been patiently waiting. To add to the story, the place was a wreck- as stated we were there for an hour just waiting!- the surrounding table were not cleared and the floor was a mess. In seeing two servers chitchatting in the front, they could have done a bit more to help the place out.   Now! This whole review could have gone differently if our waitress communicated with us and not left a hungry group of people with empty chips and salsa and empty water cups to stew in \"h'anger\". If you have a large catering order that came before us, say something! If it came after us, which I swear it did based off of our waitress's wording, remember it's first come first serve..."}
{"text":"HORRIBLY EXECUTED FOOD!!! WHAT HAPPENED HERE??? Been going to this Mexican restaurant for five years now. Before it was amazing until my recent visit. The burritos were so salty and dry. All nasty meat with no extras. There's suppose to be more than dry meat. No credit here."}
{"text":"We love this place. Like homemade Mexican.  Rice is fluffy and fresh, enchiladas are great. My wife loves the green chili plate. This place never disappoints. ."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place for our night out without the fam. And he always tries the bean and cheese burrito, if a mexican restaurant can't make great beans then its not worth eating there again, he loved them I had a cheese enchilada with a taco very delicious. We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The tacos and menudo are the best. Good prices and excellent service. Not a fancy place but it's Warm & Cozy"}
{"text":"Excellent California style mexican food, excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent green chili with meat chunks.  Tortilla chips are light and fresh.  Appears to be operated by a family who care about your experience.  Classic neighborhood Mexican cafe."}
{"text":"This little down home place was recommended by the manager from the White House thrift store. We were down in Avondale and happened to drive through old Avondale that has a few places worth stopping for. The food was very good, I ordered the beef chimichanga with guacamole and sour cream and it came with rice and beans. They have lunch specials and all the dishes are reasonable. Not fancy, but the food was delicious and our server was warm and helpful. So if in the area check it out."}
{"text":"This place in incredible! The food is wonderfully authentic and delicious! The wait staff are kind and very attentive! We will be sure to stop again the next time we are in town! I recommend the chili rellenos!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for lunch weekly, some weeks multiple times, for almost 6 years...there is a reason!  This place ruined all other Mexican food for me because now I compare everything to Cafe Zamora.  The carnitas is fabulous, the green chili is excellent, and if you really want a spicy treat get the Shrimp ala diablo!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to come. Their salsa and guacamole is to die for. I like that they bring each person their own individual bowl of salsa.   I ways get their huevos rancheros with beans and rice + homemade flour tortilla. Delicious!!!  I eat the entire plate every time."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. Love that's it's in the old part of town. Brought a friend here. She never heard of Zamora's. She loved the beans. Great friendly restaurant. I encourage everyone to come enjoy."}
{"text":"I don't know if this place has gone downhill since the last reviews or if the people involved are used to lack luster \"authentic\" Mexican food. Party of two last night, just me and the wife yet it took the staff at least 10 minutes to set our table with menus and ask us about our drink of choice. (- 1 star) I ordered a #12 (Red chili burro, taco, R & B) and my wife ordered the Carne Asada plate. The food prep took 40 minutes to get to our table (-1 star), and the only exciting thing was watching the tables next to us get food in 15 minute intervals and by the time one table is finished eating the next received their food. My red chili burro had tough meat and the sauce was clearly out of a can and the wifes Carne Asade was far from par it was a tough double bogey. (-1 star) The place was packed so I gave them some slack but when the waitress says they are out of ice while another is putting ice in a pitcher that's where I draw the line. Horrible service from the majority of servers, with only one working hard (-1 star). Nothing like waiting 10 minutes for a refill or more chips, and the whole dinner for two was nearly 1.5 hours long for a hole in the wall cafe. I normally gives places a second shot, but it's a slap in the face to a real good authentic place in other parts of the valley I.E. Pedro's in Glendale, or Rita's off 43rd ave and the I-10. I will not be back :("}
{"text":"I am disappointed with the service today. We've been here several times, and this is the first time that we've waited this long for food (over 45 minutes). We arrived when the restaurant was full, and still didn't get our food after the restaurant was empty. Completely unsatisfactory . The waitress stated that there were several takeout orders, yet no one came to pick them up. I am not sure if it was a shift change. It's pretty bad when people get there food when they arrived after we did. I am not sure I can justify coming back."}
{"text":"Rice and beans were great but my tamales were super dry. The place wasn't busy, but once the food was brought out no one ever came back to the table. It took a while to figure out that they don't bring a check, you just go to the register and tell them what table you were at to pay."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a child. I reccomend this place to all of my friends in Avondale when looking for good mexican food on a budget. Cheaper and way better than any fast food burritos"}
{"text":"This is the real deal...  Cafe Zamora is a hole in the wall dive in \"Downtown Avondale\".    Back when Bill France Jr. was alive (Bill ran NASCAR \"back in the day\" of Dale Sr.), anyway, Mr. France would have the Chef, Mr. Zamora go the the track (PIR) and cook for him...     Now that's cool in my book!  I like to order in Spanish...   it's funny because usually my white friends get a kick out of the whole experience."}
{"text":"The food is decent, though the prices seem a bit high for the quality. I enjoyed the machaca. The food was terribly slow to arrive though, which put a damper on the rest of the experience. A couple that came in after my party received their food before we did.   On a lighter note, the soup was made fresh."}
{"text":"Being a Mexican American transplant from El Paso, I was VERY disappointed with the food here. Stopped  by for breakfast/brunch and the food was not very flavorful. A good sign of a Mexican restaurant is the salsa thy accompanies the chips. In short, NOT GOOD. In addition, the three of us ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was almost as though they forgot to add any spices to the dish, while the side of potatoes looked (and tasted) like they had been fried a day ago. We're also spoiled in that, being raised in El Paso, we're used to Mexican restaurants that serve homemade tortillas,  and I've been very surprised (i.e. DISAPPOINTED) that even more \"traditional\" restaurants like Cafe Zamora serve those awful, rubbery tortillas that come off a Costo conveyor belt. To top it off, I had to ask for a glass of water THREE times and received it after my meal had been served. As for the waitresses, I would recommend that they learn how to smile a little more. A welcoming \"sonriisa\" can go a long way.   Overall, if you're a Mexican food enthusiast, I recommend you bypass this joint. I know that my search for an equivalent to El Paso's DELICIOUS \"Lunchbox\" restaurant continues (and maybe the owner of Cafe Zamora should check it out to see how it's really done.)..."}
{"text":"I have been to Zamora's over 20 times. This place has salsa and warm chips to die for, and an endless supply of it at no extra cost. They don't make you feel guilty for loving their salsa! . A \"dive\" atmosphere - - but who cares? I recommend the Breakfast Chili Rellenos for breakfast , which is the best Mexican breakfast I have ever had in my 32 years in Az. Excellent food Zamora's - keep it up! (just please remember to smile at us gringos) There is one particular waitress there that has a perpetual frown on her face"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want authentic mexican food!  The salsa is freshly made every day and is the best I've ever tasted.  The enchilada sauce is my wife's favorite and we go there about once a month.  Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly.  I'm not sure about the negative reviews I've read - maybe they were looking for more \"americanized\" mexican food.  If you like authentic mexican, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Best hole in the ground you'll find. Excellent food and service. Hidden treasure in A-town. In Mexican tradition it's the least fancy places with the best food."}
{"text":"Save yourself and try somewhere else. The taco and relleno plate was just horrible. A mush of egg and bad cheese. Taco was dripping oil.  My sister's huevos rancheros weren't much better.  Bland tomato sauce.  There is better food out there."}
{"text":"Best place for real authentic Mexican Food! If you want a taste of Mexico, then you need to come here!"}
{"text":"Went all around looking for some great authentic Mexican \"hole in the wall \" place to eat when my brother who lives here recommended here. My son had to use the restroom and to my surprised, it was clean. The place was very clean and not too busy. It was almost 2:00 pm and they offered lunch specials till 2 and we just made it. The waitress was very nice and friendly and offered us chips and salsa. I didn't eat any but my 3 brothers ate and said it was good. My son a picky eater ordered hamburger and fries (which I was glad they had on the menu). I had the #6 enchiladas lunch special. It came with rice, beans and salad, just enough portion. It was served on a hot plate and it was good. I didn't need any meat, cheese was just good! My brothers had the #8 combo which they ate all! The rice and beans was good too. I found a new place to come eat good authentic Mexican while visiting family in Avondale."}
{"text":"The green chili is very good. The beans are awesome. I ordered the green chili in a bowl and side of beans and water. The tortilla would have been extra but they said the boss didn't charge me for it. The total was 12 dollars and change The food was worth it. The chips are too thick and the salsa was a little bitter. The green chili is worth the time."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a 5 star for food and a 3 star for location.  Located in the heart of downtown/old town Avondale.  This little place which is actually much bigger on the inside is a little bit of heaven.  Talk about Mexican comfort food. They have all the usual fair plus a few good soups.    You start with the Chips and Salsa.  The Salsa was homemade and oh so delicious.  I had the BBQ Plate which was an explosion of flavor.  I can't even tell how good this was. It came with seasoned beef, rice,beans, guacamole, and tortillas. My mouth waters thinking about when I will be able to get this dish again.  My wife had the Machaca Burro which was also very delicious.  Soda's are served in huge cups.    This place is good.  It looks a little bit run down on the outside but on the inside its nice and clean.  Even though this is defiantly a spot where local regulars come do not be intimidated to walk in as they are very welcoming and after one visit you will want to be a regular.  If your looking for GOOD homemade Mexican food try Cafe Zamora.  Come here for lunch and give it a chance. The price is just right too."}
{"text":"My grandmother's house is literally on the corner from this Resturaunt and we've been there several times. I moved away from the area 2 years ago and went by today and was super disappointed. We walked in and were told to sit where we like. We sat down for 15 minutes not 1 person addressed us, people who arrived after we did were helped and had their order taken as we still sat waiting. We walked out and I will never go back. That's horrible customer service, well they won't get my money."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service.  Had the 3 tacos combo w carnitas and it was delicious, the meat was perfect.  The drinks are huge and they have amazing horchata, perfectly creamy and sweetened to perfection.My daughter had the bean burrito and ate thr whole thing   Think her name was lena but she was a hostess.Not only her but our server was professional and sweet.  The owner  went above and beyond to accommodate us. Only complaint was the donkey didn't work. =(   will definitely return, even if it's by myself. Thank you cafe Zamora."}
{"text":"Love the food and service, the home style authentic Mexican food is comfort. I have suggested this place to many of my friends and out of town family members. The service is fast and awesome,  the owner came out to greet us and thanked us for coming in. This is a must if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Been going to Cafe Zamora's for years, grew up in the neighborhood and everyone knows this is the place to get that closest to your mama's homemade Mexican cooking!  I've read other reviews and you do not go to Cafe Zamora's for the chicken dishes, you go to Cafe Zamora's for the beef dishes--enchiladas--shredded beef chimichangas--and my ultra favorite--the RED CHILI BEEF BURRITO ENICHILALAS STYLE!  Love this place and will continue to love it."}
{"text":"After church on Sunday, my wife brought me to Zamora's, saying that she really liked it. After I left, I was also a huge fan.  The chips and salsa are some of the best I've ever had. The salsa had a decent amount of heat, but not too much. The chips were also done to perfection. We both had tacos, containing really great shredded beef. The tostadas and enchiladas are pretty tasty, as well.  They have lunch specials 7 days a week, and I believe I saw dinner specials as well.  Talking to one of the employees on the way out, it sounds like their business has dropped off because of all the business closures in that area. Folks, do not let this place go away...it is a hidden treasure."}
{"text":"Super red burro, deep fried, enchilada style, yummy! The rice here is almost as good as my mom used to make. The enchilada sauce is almost as good as I make, My mom taught me!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Didn't really care for the chips and salsa. Chips were kinda stale. Got the carne asada burrito, it was good"}
{"text":"Don't you just love it when... You walk into a restaurant and you're treated like family.  Let me explain... Was introduced to this place by my boyfriend who had frequented this marvelous place in the past. SO happy to have found a solid mexican restaurant.  It's tucked away and doesn't look like much on the outside but the service is always so friendly and they always go above and beyond, plus it just feels like home.   Tip: Ask for a side of enchilada sauce with your meal then proceed to drizzle that on everything, amazing stuff, I seriously wish I had the recipe!"}
