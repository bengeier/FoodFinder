{"text":"This is so worth it! The fries are crispy and delicious and the chicken is very flavorful!! Overall awesome combo, great service, and I'll definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"New trend with the  Buffalo fries style in town, just dip them in ranch dressing and you will love them even more... wings have a good taste to it.... next time I will try the Ribs with only two days open that's seems to be the place to go... if you can stop you should give it a try... definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Great varieties for food but the buffalo fries are the best out there ! Their sauce tastes really good. They just opened not too long ago so I can understand the long lines but I don't mind for the wait because the food makes it all worth it !"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Highly recommend to anyone in the area. I usually get the buffalo fries with chipotle sauce"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the service. With the restaurant closing at 11 I rushed to get there about 1035~. I was very rudely told to kick rocks, then essentially mocked by one of the cocks in the back. If I told it was closed I would have been disappointed but moved on. If I could I would have left -2 star review."}
{"text":"I had a great experience! Good food, amount of food & super cheap. The ladies that I experienced were both friendly too! Def will be back"}
{"text":"The wings were dry not enough sauce on them. Price wise it was to much for the quality  of the food."}
{"text":"Although the service was excellent, the food wasn't. I ordered the famous buffalo fries which the fries were hard and the chicken dry. A slab of ribs were not cooked all the way through. I don't think I'll be trying them again."}
{"text":"Wings suck needs more flavor, wings are to dry. Ribs are also not good . The only thing I can say are alright are the buffalo fries. Wing stop and Peter piper wings are better!"}
{"text":"We had pretty high hopes for this place. We'd seen a lot of reviews that were decent and the concept seemed fun. The employees all seemed miserable when we placed our order. We asked what the cashier's favorite sauce was and it was like she didn't want to tell us. So we placed our order and went to sit down in the back. While waiting for our food, we saw our family's order that came out right before ours. Their buffalo fries seemed to not have much sauce on them and the \"mild\" that they ordered tasted like it was only butter on the chicken. So my husband went to the cashier and bought three more sauces so that we could try them. During this time they called our order so I went up to get it. They told him that the sauces would be right out, mind you the sauces are sitting in a mini fridge under the counter. They made him stand and wait at the front for about three minutes for he sauces while his food is sitting at the table. Yeah it's not a lot of time but come on people, bend over get the darn sauces and give them to your customer.  Overall the taste of everything just tasted fried. The popcorn chicken was mostly breading. It tasted like you were eating fry bread. The sauces were okay. I asked for their special sauce on the side of my buffalo fries and they drizzled it on top instead. Not overly big deals, but given the price for wings and fries and cruddy customer service we will not be back and I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Food is great! People are friendly and it is a very clean place . I had the buffalo fries and they are great every time !"}
{"text":"Soooooooo bomb!!! The buffalo fries are like nothing I've ever had before and now I crave them everyday! A must try! Expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"I see my fianc√©'s cousins post about this place ALL THE TIME. And because of that, I felt that it was only right to try this out myself. The first thing I notice is that this place was super packed, so this must mean that it's THAT GOOD.   If you love boneless wings and French fries (who doesn't?), then this is the place for you. I tried the buffalo fries with honey bbq... SO GOOD!!!   Of course I took my friends with me and they all said it was bomb! We live about 35-40 mins away and it was worth the drive!"}
{"text":"good, but definitely over hyped. Also Overpriced, extra $$ if you want the fries seasoned, Ridiculous. oh and long wait time."}
{"text":"Went here today first there's no seats which is good. But also as soon as we walked in all I could hear is the ac rumbling which really hurt and annoyed my ears. So bad that I had to leave without even ordering. Was so excited to try this place but that sound and loud rattling killed it for me. Hopefully y'all get this fixed the next time we try to come in."}
{"text":"I love this place! Fries are crunchy and wings are flavorful I always get the mild buffalo sauce with the chipotle sauce and ranch. Happy to have it here in AZ!!"}
{"text":"The fries  and chicken It's alright I wouldn't say it's the best thing .  But ehhh .    I also had the traditional very hot wings , it wasn't hot at all nothing not even a zing!  I thought maybe the style would be fridge time from other wings restaurants , but it has a very common taste to other wings stores .    It is somewhat pricey"}
{"text":"This place was great the first week they opened. Since then, everything has gone down hill. I tried calling a week ago when they just opened to place a very large catering order and they wouldn't answer the phone. I tried calling 6 times through out the day and they kept ignoring the calls. They lost a large order and I took my business to Canes.   The portions on the buffalo fries get smaller and smaller each time I've been back since the grand opening. This last time we went and ordered take out, after looking at the food we just requested our money back and went home hungry. The last 2 times we went as well, the buffalo chicken was very dry and had visible spots that had no sauce at all. If we have to ask for extra sauce and pay $2 more for \"extra chicken\" to make it what it was the first week they opened, we won't be back. Oh, and expect to wait a minimum of 10 min for your food. Sad because my husband LOVED this place when they first opened and even said he would choose it over canes. Now he said he will never go back :/"}
{"text":"This place is going to be exactly what you're expecting. However, I enjoyed the food very much. I would definitely go there again it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"So happy that they opened one in Arizona  my wait is finally over . Definitely worth the wait from ever single bite I took  I most definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I ordered the buffalo fried with original hot. It wa super dry and the sauce isn't hot at all.  Honestly the biggest let down was the employees attitudes.   Customer service is awful.  Also it would help if the employees would change gloves every time they go from kitchen to the register and back.  The grease stays all over the box."}
{"text":"Buffalo fries were amazing!!!! Definitely will go back again. One thing I was a little disappointed was the cashier (Estrella)  she was rude and when I would ask her a questions about the menu she answer me with a attitude.  I would understand if was busy but it wasn't it. Overall great food , but customer service is 1st!!!"}
{"text":"I've had this placed bookmarked for about a century now and I finally got to try it tonight... sooooooo worth the wait! They have a BUNCH of different flavors of sauces that can go over your buffalo chicken fries and each comes with their chipotle ranch sauce either on top or on the side.   I ended up getting the large buffalo fries cause it comes with a free large drink on Monday and I was so sad that I couldn't finish it. It was THAT big but it was THAT good. They also have 55 cent boneless wings on Tuesdays.... guess I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Great customer service!! I got the regular hot buffalo fries with special sauce, delicious!! I will definitely be coming back to try more things on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I love chicken wings!!! I mean I love them!!! This place was isn't the best place for wings. But it isn't the worse. The food was cold and the fries were soggy. The sauce was really good. I could have used some ranch. The lady that took my order was a little rude and not very friendly. I'd go there again just probably not any time soon."}
{"text":"BOMB!!! i'm surprised this spot isn't all over the valley yet. The fries is something different, but a good different. My boyfriend and I shared a large order of buffalo fries with extra chicken & sauce - & we had leftovers. I've yet to try anything else but that shall change as i will be back very soon. Super chill place inside as well, large TV screens & good atmosphere. Pricing is decent"}
{"text":"It's a long wait but damn is it worth the wait. So good. Only sad thing is they were out of the hottest sauce they had so I had to stick with very hot (which was still extremely good) I'll be back for a third time very soon"}
{"text":"I was not pleased with my experience. I ordered fries with cheese which was understandably extra. However, when I received my order there was hardly any cheese and when I questioned this the manager stated those were the rules that she didn't make them. She then said sorry in a very condescending tone. She did not seem to care that I was dissatisfied with my food. The price of the food is not reflected in the amount you receive nor its quality. I definitely don't recommend this place if you want your experience to be a satisfying one."}
{"text":"Love the food, great flavor and taste  Service isn't great  due to busy rush customers #unstoppable but overall good  place to order take out"}
{"text":"This place was so overhyped. I got the \"world famous buffalo fries\", had maybe 3-4 bites and threw the rest away. They tasted like they were microwaved from the freezer and left out for hours. The wait was really long but that was expected. I would not come back. My friend, who is a wing fanatic, said the same thing. I've had better wings from Buffalo Wild Wings... and I don't even like that place."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place a while ago and tonight we were in the mood for some serious junk food so we decided to give it a try. It's a small place where you order at the counter and either grab one of the tables or get it to go. It seems like most people get their orders to go as there was always a steady stream of customers in and out of the place. They do have a couple of tvs if you decide to stay and eat.  We had three orders of buffalo fries....one medium and two teriyaki. It's essentially fries with boneless chicken tossed in sauce over the top and some Parmesan. They also have a special sauce but we opted to get it on the side. The servings are huge and the fries are crispy. I found the teriyaki sauce to be a bit salty but the special sauce was good. My husband had the ribs which he enjoyed.  The staff was friendly and the place was reasonably clean. Dinner for 4 with fountain drinks was $51.00."}
{"text":"So freaking good My husband thought they could put a bit more chicken on the large frys with buffalo chicken  but the sauce and cheese was fuc**** BOMB ASFFFFFFFFFFF"}
{"text":"This place has been so hyped-up since it opened that they actually posted a sign on their door saying that they were closed due to running out of food! After that initial disappointing visit, I went back when it reopened and ordered two orders of buffalo fries, one mild and one chipotle. My only complaints are that the wings weren't saucy or spicy enough. Other than that, this place is so good! Definitely a must-try"}
{"text":"I've seen pictures of Buffalo Fries all over Twitter and when I heard they opened one in Phoenix, I had to try it! We got there at night and at first I thought it was gonna be a long wait because it was busy but the line actually went by quick! Also, the wait for the food was fast and it wasn't bad at all. We probably waited 10 mins for our food.  The prices for Buffalo Fries are pretty decent. $5.25 for a small and $8.55 for regular. I ordered a small for myself. At first I was pretty worried that small wasn't going to be filling because the box for the small was tiny and it was one of those take home boxes for left overs. To my surprise is actually filled me up! I was able to eat one small by myself. Two of my friends who came with me shared a regular and it was pretty big. They got full and had some left over still.   The fries had a perfect texture. It wasn't too hard or soft and they were crispy! The chicken was very good as well. The meat was tender and had a decent amount of sauce on them. The chipotle sauce definitely gives it a good kick in your taste too. They had a interesting way of presenting your ordered food. When you go over to the counter to pick it up they had to physically open the box themselves and show it to you before they hand it to you. Definitely something different for a fast food service.   Over all the environment was good and the food was great. However, one negative thing I have to say was the customer service. My friend had to use the bathroom but their bathrooms require a code. When she went to go ask, the person gave her a dirty look and ignored her until she was done do whatever she was doing. That's my reason for the minus one star."}
{"text":"No need to advertise this place, it seems that everyone loves posting their buffalo fries on snapchat as much as they love eating them. With that said, I figured I had to check it out before moving out of Phoenix!   I got there around 2:15 on a Monday afternoon and it was PACKED (and of course, everyone in the place had their phones out taking pictures of their food). So needless to say, I was excited. This is where my excitement peaked though.  I got a large order of buffalo fries with the pineapple jalapeno sauce which came with a free drink for their Monday special (sweet!). Once I got my food I went to dive in and came up somewhat underwhelmed.   The chicken and the sauce was pretty good, there wasn't too much heat to the sauce which I was kind of disapointed with but besides that it was sweet and slightly tangy. Overall though, the order was pretty bland, the fries weren't seasoned and it didn't seem there was enough sauce to overcome the blandness of the fries.  I really wanted to love this place and will fully admit that my disappointment might be a result of my order (I think one of the burritos pictured would be a better choice). I would give this place another try and I'd really love to actually try their barbecue or wings as both options seemed really good."}
{"text":"Don't bother  calling in a order they don't remember to put it in . Their food is good but the chicken is under sauced .."}
{"text":"It's was good, but presentation was below expectations. Still worth dining for a fast meal."}
{"text":"Kept hearing all the hype about this place so had to check it out myself. This place is AMAZING! so worth the wait if you love wings. I ordered the buffalo Cali burrito and the buffalo wing fries of course. Everyone should try this place out just once."}
{"text":"This spot is pretty good! I would go again. I got the regular, mild buffalo fries with their sauce on top. A lot more fries than chicken. I wish there was more mild buffalo sauce on them because the chicken was a little dry with not too much of the buffalo flavor but maybe you can ask for extra of that."}
{"text":"Wings - Gross & I asked for extra crispy and they were NOT. fries- Yumm! & they have good ranch. Unlce Tonys down the street has great wings tho"}
{"text":"The customer service here was really good, everyone was friendly. We ordered the buffalo chicken fries, side salad, and original hot wings. The fries were amazing. I ordered the special sauce on the side because I don't like everything to be wet and that was also really good! The side salad was good, nothing special but a regular salad that was perfect to eat with wings. I gave this place 4 stars because the wings were a bit soggy. I like my wings cooked more so next time I come I'll see if that is an option."}
{"text":"This place is really packed but the food is worth it!! The buffalo fries are the best. I don't know why someone gave it 1 star I don't think guacamole and sour cream go with hot wings? But this place is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"First time visiting and got pretty lucky with the short line when I got in. I arrived at noon it wasn't too busy but the line definitely got longer when I finished ordering and stayed pretty consistent after that. I decided to order the famous buffalo fries from their menu. The menu was pretty straight forward and easy to read. The fries were yummy but I didn't really care for the chicken but overall it was a good experience and I will give this place another shot and probably try a different flavor"}
{"text":"Good wings, similar to all the other wing places. What sets this place off is the buffalo fries. Small bite-size nuggets of chicken over fries with some dressing. Simple but truly amazing. Great for March madness. Didn't have time to get a picture-dig into it while opening the container. Made fresh to order."}
{"text":"The food is ok, drove a good 40 minutes to try for the first time. Wanted to dine in so the fries wouldn't be soggy but there was not enough seating so we just took it home. I'm sure the food would taste better fresh but for the most part it was still good. Idk if I would take the drive again though."}
{"text":"Gonna keep this one short and sweet... Heard about their \"famous\" buffalo fries. I'm not one to turn down anything with the word \"buffalo\" or \"fries\" in it.  The fries were cooked perfectly and came out super hot (as all fries should).  I got the pineapple jalape√±o flavor...a good choice on my part, I should add. It was flavorful, although not as spicy as I normally like it. My 6 year old was able to eat it, no problems.  My daughter got the plain tenders with a side of ranch...they were good. Nothing extraordinary...but then again, they're plain tenders. The ranch was good. I love when a wing place has legit good tasting ranch.  We also got some with the honey bbq sauce because it was recommended by the cashier. Eh, it was ok. I mean, it was simple honey bbq.  Now the negative about this place. The prices. They seem a bit on the expensive side for what it is. Other than that, I'd probably come back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Environment is nice. Good location. Inside looks great and original. I ordered a regular sized order of the chicken fries with the atomic hot (I can handle real heat) but I feel as if they weren't hot enough. I could very closely compare the sauce to Tapatio, which is not to call them out and say they use that (I obviously don't know how they make their sauces) but the heat is comparable to that. The special sauce is pretty dang good as well. The reason why I'm giving this place is because of the staff, specifically customer service. This place is a small, fast food joint, that happens to sell really good chicken fries. But the customer service was near terrible. I walk up to the register to order and the cashier didn't even say \"Good evening\" after I said \"Hello.\" and she just ignored me for about 3 minutes (something was wrong with the machine). She could've at least told me to give her a moment, she is blessed I'm not rude, almost anyone else would've complained. Then once she's ready to take my order, she says \"What do you want?\" in the most bland way possible. I order the fries with atomic hot sauce and she says \"Special sauce on or on the side.\" I didn't here her so I say \"Excuse me?\" And she says \"Sauce.\" My mind kind of rewinds what she said and I tell her \"On the side please.\"  I know this doesn't sound like a HUGE deal, the place is still great, but that girl just had the look of \"I'm here for my check.\" Have some pride in what you do! I'm a cashier myself so I know what I'm talking about, just be happy and welcoming to the customer, without them you don't get a check."}
{"text":"My wish came true now I have a little piece of my hometown here in AZ. Everything here is to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"Drove an hour to go check this place out and it was well worth it!!! Yes the place was super busy as expected we got right in and ordered our food and the wait for the food wasn't that long. The food was well satisfyingthe little thing I didn't  like is that they gave me a ranch half full and then charge you extra for morebut I understand they have to make there money!"}
{"text":"Came here on the grand opening day and it was great! Their buffalo fries are worth the hype, I spoke to whom seemed to be the owner and he was a great guy. The only thing I could complain about is the fact that they don't have military discount set up, and I'm all about that! But try the buffalo fries!"}
{"text":"Really good food! The wings are huge and the flavor of the wings were pretty good too. Had the Atomic Hot in traditional wings and on our buffalo fries. The buffalo fries are what makes this place stand out if feel. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I recently visited the buffalo spot for the first time. I did visit during a 'busier' time. There was a few people ahead of me ordering and about 15-20 people waiting in line for their food. My order was actually skipped. I did not receive my food in the number order their food tickets were creating when I paid. I did have to ask an employee for my food. Shortly after, my food was brought out. It was fantastic! I highly recommend the buffalo fries. An employee gave me a good suggestion on my order as this was my first time visiting. Other than the wait time and my order being forgotten, I had a good experience. I will definitely be back for those buffalo fries!"}
{"text":"This place legit is over hyped holy shit it's chicken and fries and the chicken taste like cardboard there's no pico no guac no sour cream I'm Better off with my carne asada fries"}
{"text":"Out looking for a quick bite to eat and ran across this place on Yelp and decided to give it a whirl.   I arrived at almost three pm and it was quite busy which surprised me. A quick glance at the patrons offered an explanation, the restaurant was mostly occupied by college aged young folks.   A glance at the menu and portion sizes made me understand immediately why this would be a target crowd. The portions are huge.. of the buffalo fries anyway, and it looked as though that's what most folks were ordering.   I got a regular order of Jamaican jerk chicken buffalo fries and the flavor did not disappoint.   The popcorn chicken on top was surprisingly well seasoned with just the right amount of special sauce.   The fries were hot,crispy and plentiful. Had I known it would have been such a large portion I would have got a small, because two people can eat the regular and be satisfied.   All in all a good lunch at a reasonable price! I could definitely see myself coming back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Place sucks and you can't even call your order for pick up. Workers don't know what they're doing and it's always a mess. Plus the workers are ghetto!"}
{"text":"Different take on chicken wings but a good different. I had the Original Hot Buffalo Fries and my fianc√© had the Medium Buffalo Fries. Both of us agreed that the fires were done well and the amount of chicken you get is a good amount. My soon to be mother-in-law had a salad which she thoroughly enjoyed. I'd go back and try the traditional wings and maybe the boneless as well. Not overly expensive and lot of food for the price!"}
{"text":"Execellent food and service!  Highly Recommend this place!  Great prices and big portions."}
{"text":"I heard about this place and had to see whats its all about. Very busy place and staff was outstanding"}
{"text":"So for my local Texan yelpers this place might seem a little bit like it does not exist in Texas which is true but on my little trip I definitely had the pleasure to experience this place so you go into this place thinking. That it's all about the buffalo wings and that everything about it is the wings and how the waves were prepared and they've got to be really good wings. But on the contrary to the the sign that talks about buffalo wings the actual main part of the restaurant is the Buffalo fries oh my goodness it was very shocking to take something so usual buffalo chicken deep-fried small bites on top of french fries with a little extra sauce and a side or as they like to say a dab of ranch on the side will just completely take you to a whole new place your mouth explodes with the deliciousness that comes out of every bite yes it is spicy but the bite is so incredible you bite right back It's so good you can't stop biting back. I would honestly make the drive again to go to visit one of these locations or if I could find a location anywhere I would go to that location. Without a doubt stop and have some Buffalo fries yelpers go check it out give me your opinion"}
{"text":"Me & the wifey tried, The Buffalo Spot last night. We got an large order of pineapple & jalape√±o fries with chipotle sauce and cheese on top! It was delicious, however my taste buds didn't care too much for it. I love the concept an will continue to try another of their many flavors! The cashier in the front was very nice, the tables needed a little cleaning, besides that I'd say go try it for yourself :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend saw this place advertised on the news and immediately told me.  We love eating out and we love anything buffalo style.  Plus I'm from Buffalo and I'm still on the hunt for the place with the best flavor and wings in the Phoenix area.  This place was not close to where we live but we figured we had to check it out.  By how busy it was, I knew I was going to love it.  WELLLLL, to say we were disappointed is putting it mildly.  We didn't like it at all.  We were cool with the wait considering how long the lines were and all the people waiting.  We waited about 30mins to get our food after we waited in line for about 15 mins to order.  We had the boneless wings in pineapple jalapeno and we were EXTREMELY disappointed.  The flavor was pretty boring.  Plus, 1 of the boneless wings was either a full piece of fat or it just wasn't cooked all the way.  I had to spit it out.  (Sorry, I know that is really gross but I had too).  My boyfriend ordered the ribs and they were super dry with hardly any meat on them.  We also ordered a medium size of their \"World's Famous Buffalo Fries\".  I struggled with wanting to know who came up with that slogan because it is NOT even close to the truth.  They weren't awful but nothing to brag about.  So $29 later and our stomachs not satisfied or full, we will not be going back again.  Huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"The food was good but it got old real quick. The buffalo fries are definitely not a meal and should be treated more like a side dish. With that being said I would recommend the smallest size if you absolutely must try this place."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. Clean location and easy to get to from the 17. I got the small Jamaican jerk fries . Their special sauce on the side with a regular drink. 8 bucks. This flavor was one of the spicy flavors and it had a good amount of heat but nothing crazy.    Chicken to fries ratio was good. Taste was delicious . No complaints here. Fries were crispy and hot.   They didn't have bread sticks today so I'll have to come back.   You need to be buzzed into the bathrooms.   I'll def be back."}
{"text":"It was okay. Service was okay. Ordered 25 piece family traditional wings. Sauce on side. Kinda stingy with the sauce considering wings cost averaged over $1 a piece. Asked for carrots and celery. Got 2 stingy bags. Wait was not long and order was prepared freshly. Overall, nothing stands out about this place! To be fair though, it is worth going to except the employees seem a little bit uptight. People always ask me about a good place for wings however, so far, Crazy Mike's on Bell still has the best wings I've experienced here in Phoenix. I'm thinking that at these prices though, someone should offer free range wings with everything on the menu made from scratch and sides locally grown and sourced."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Have to say it's the best one I've been to so far. The wait for my food wasn't bad. They just opened about a week ago so I understand. I ordered the fries with the medium sauce with cheddar and they were delicious. Yes they don't come with guacamole or sour cream (someone posted below) because it isn't not a Mexican food place . It's BBQ. The service was great as well . I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Wasn't as good as the picture looks :(  I was eyeing this place for about 3 months it seemed! I said screw it recently and drove 35min (one way) because it looks so good!   First impressions, this place is Divey as heck! Not a bad thing, its just in that type of area! The employee up front was talking about 150 mph and I had to ask her to repeat what she was saying 3x. Even then, she was looking down and away trying to multi-task. I couldn't hear her though! \"do you want cheese\" or \"sauce on top\" should be easily heard. Coincidentally, I now see other reviews saying the same thing about not being able to hear her. Shes a nice girl, but she just needs to slow her role lol.   Food was OK. Honestly, I do think it looks a whole lot better than it tastes. They have plentiful flavors and menu options to go. The entire time I was there, people were in-n-out. It was busy, and for good reason I imagine. However, the tables were dirty. I was there for about 25 minutes and I saw a person go around and clean empty tables once. Meaning, my table and other tables that were already sat in....she left dirty. For a busy place like this with limited seating...I think this should be more on the priority side.   The food was OK. There wasn't anything crazy about it. Maybe next time I'll order something different and better tasting. However, I won't be in a rush to drive 35 minutes back to this place seeing that my first experience wasn't all that :("}
{"text":"This place is super close to our friends' place, so my s/o and I went here one day for dinner after seeing my friends. There was a long wait, and when I didn't understand what the person at the counter was saying, she made a face like I was inconveniencing her.  When we went to get our order after a pretty long wait, they had forgotten the veggies that we had requested. My s/o went up to the counter because he knows I need veggies to go with my wings, and they handed him to plastic bags with carrots and celery in it. The veggies were weirdly wet, so I didn't get to eat them anyway. The wings had too much sauce for the amount of meat on them (imo), and the honey bbq (which I ordered) was nothing to write home about. I think my boyfriend enjoyed his pineapple jalapeno wings more than I liked my food, but we both agreed that for the quality and flavor, this place sure isn't worth its price.  I also had to use the restroom partway through the meal. The bathroom had a code on it, and we had to ask one of the people at the front to unlock it. He pressed a button, and the door wouldn't open. I gestured across the restaurant that it wasn't working, and he got visibly annoyed. He didn't come to help, and just kept gesturing that I keep trying. Maybe on the 4th or 5th time, I heard the door click, and it finally unlocked. So, it ended up not being my fault, and he made me feel incompetent, which is not a good feeling.   It does seem like maybe the fries are really the draw for this place, so I would be potentially willing to come back for fries (to go!) and give this place another chance, but probably not."}
{"text":"This place smells like sewage when you walk in.  The sauces do not taste very good and the chunks of chicken are small and hard inn the buffalo fries.  I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The buffalo spot.  \"Potato Chicken\" Inspiration: 10/10 Frame: 1/10 Colors: 7/10  Located  inside to the left of the entrance door. What came first? The chicken or the potato? This painting brings in a NEW and unexpected outlier to the age old question. I did wait in line for 40 minutes. Following that, I waited 15 for food. I'm convinced this is all due to the spot being fairly new. However, I got what I came for and it was worth it. Chicken potato."}
{"text":"This place is crack cocaine one of my fav spots to eat for sure i love the Buffalo fries bomb!!"}
{"text":"To me , it was good . Nothing about it really stood out . It wasn't life changing or anything  We drove for a long while to get there so I was hoping it would be the best buffalo I've had but ehh. I would go back though honestly. Fries buffalo and cheese? Who wouldn't lol  Just like I said it wasn't as good as people hype it to to be"}
{"text":"Not worth the price over $11.00 for 5 tiny wings watered down blue cheese and a soda, flavor was good but the meal didn't fill me up I had to go and eat lunch again with in an hour and spend another 6 bucks."}
{"text":"I was working off Dunlap Nd 22nd ave and decided to YELP near by restaurants Nd I found the BUFFALO SPOT which at the time had 4 stars. I looked through the pictures and it all looked so delicious. It was a tough decision but I chose the CALI BURRITO. This burrito includes fries, fried chicken pieces coated in the sauce of your choice(honey bbq). You can choose to have their special sauce in the burrito or on the side. I chose on the side since I didn't know if I would like it. The special sauce taste like ranch and sirracha sauce mixed together. It is all soooooooooo good next time I will have the special sauce added to my burrito."}
{"text":"It was okay... Not quite what I expected. Food was extremely greasy and fries were bland and soggy."}
{"text":"the sauces are garbage! never ever get the traditional wings! they give you the skeleton of the chicken! anorexic emo chicken all skinny! the sauces are water id rather eat a live chicken with a raw potato on the side!"}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good, I really did. I've been here twice now and both times I have been underwhelmed. It's right by my work and even closer to my girlfriends.   For my first visit, it had only been open a few weeks so I had high hopes. I purchased their most advertised item, a large order of buffalo fries with the hot buffalo sauce. Fries were extremely soggy and buffalo bites were puny/scarce. I vowed not to go back but I truly wanted to enjoy this place.  I tried it again two weeks ago on a Sunday night, about 45 minutes before they closed. My girl and I ordered 10 boneless wings, 5 original, one of which was considered a combo that came with a small order of buffalo fries. She requested the original wings to be crispy. I will give credit to the girl working behind the the register, because the two of us were taking forever to decide.   Food took about 10 minutes to prepare and cost over $30. Not terrible and luckily she gave us an extra ranch without charging. Food was again, just not that good. Boneless wings were incredibly under sauced, the original ones were not even CLOSE to being well done. And again, I received fries that were mushy and just not fresh out of a fryer. It was only a 2 minute drive home, so i can't blame it on that. I worked on a fryer for over a year, and all I can say is it makes a huge difference when those fries come out of the fryer and when you get them to the customer. Cooks need some better training or to be motivated to give half a hoot.  Bottom line: service is good, but if you want good wings/fries, head to ATL. This place will just leave you with a stomach ache and unmet expectation."}
{"text":"We've been anticipating the opening of this spot since we heard it was coming to town. We came for their signature buffalo fries and we were happy that we did. If your not down to try the fries they also have wings (boneless and traditional with a variety of sauces to choose from)and ribs in the menu."}
{"text":"Over hyped place. The service was well organized for the amount of people there but for over an hour wait the food isn't worth it. Lemon pepper wings didn't taste great and the Buffalo fries didn't taste as expected. But the secret sauce is really good."}
{"text":"If your from Buffalo and your looking for some home town food.  This is not the place.  I do not fault them at all.  The curiosity got me there.  This place has the potential to be a 4 star review.  I like the Menu.  It's a simple combination of simple items.  I did not know prior to that this was a southern California food chain.  There specialty is fried chicken bites, tossed in sauce(I did Buffalo Original which was fairly spicy, more than most places), covering French fries.  With some other ranch based sauce spread arrpund.  The chicken surprisingly good.  I've never had small chicken bites with the rite crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  I ended up eating half the fries and most of the chicken.  The order was a regular and was way more than the average person would want to eat.  Should have gotten a small order.   The two stars is because the service was very slow, not friendly or helpful at the register at all.  Took 15 minutes during a moderate lunch crowd to get my food.  The way they distribute the food was very difficult.  The person's working at the counter would yell your order from the counter.  Problem is all the seating is way behind the counter with a kitchen wall between you.  As a result you had 8 customers or so kind of meandering arround between they're seat and the counter.  I got out of my seat several times thinking the girl called my order(very unclearly).  Then on top of that they had a pallet of fry oil in the middle of the restaurant lobby.  Load if the employees where too lazy to put it away.  This place has got a management problem.  Which the result is a employee problem.  This place could be similar to Canes which is always clean, with good presentation, and quick friendly service."}
{"text":"Straight up Original Hot is hands down SO. DAMN. GOOD. Service is pretty quick and food is great."}
{"text":"The buffalo fires are amazing!! Place could be a little bigger but I guess that's just a result of how good it is that it's always busy"}
{"text":"The employees were nice and the food was okay. But, the location smelled like the back of a buffalo!   Excited to see this place open here-had them in Long Beach 3 years ago and have been craving them ever since. So here's what went wrong...  Walk in and it stinks like the drains and grease traps have not been cleaned. I've worked in the food industry and know what this smell is. It's unpleasant and nasty. Next, there are major leaks coming from the ceiling with bus tubs catching the water. One of these tubs is right by he register when you order and especially close to the plastic cutlery they give you.   As if this wasn't enough, the dining area is a mess- picture trash and uncleaned tables. There are no lids at all for any of the drinks. Meanwhile there are several employees standing around in the kitchen doing nothing. The best part was when in employee came out to fill up their personal drink and didn't think to come back to clean up the dining room or even stock up the empty drink lids.  The Manager needs to have a serious talk with the location and teach their employees how to clean the grease traps-no one is going to want to eat there if the place smells like shit and looks janky."}
{"text":"I heard and read a lot about this place and was happy when I finally heard they were opening a location in Phoenix, since all their existing locations are in California where they started.. I love the whole concept of the menu along with buffalo sauce being the main ingredient because I am a HUGE buffalo sauce fan a put it on pretty much everything I eat, along with ranch.. overall the food was decent, nothing special for the price points of the portions you got. One of the orders of boneless wings I ordered had barely any sauce and I had to take it back and have them \"re-sauce\" them, which they seemed annoyed, I also asked for some extra ranch at that time, which they charged me for. Overall my visit was frustrating and I understand it could of been an \"off\" night, but with the prices being as high as they are, the quality of food to me wasn't worth it, great concept, but overpriced and under delivered in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great fries and chicken. The sauce is delicious and just compliments the fries and the chicken. The salads are also very good especially with the different flavors of chicken. The Onion rings are also an excellent treat too. Great spot, but I wish there were more locations in the valley! However, we'll make the drive!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place and I thought I would BUT....  1. Chicken was cold when it came out for both of our orders.  2. Comes with a special sauce on top that I wasn't told about (maybe I was but hard to hear over the loud music and rush attitude of the cashier). The \"special sauce\" isn't special at all - skip it.  3. I chose to add Parmesan on top but wasn't made aware there are other cheese options - I prefer cheddar with my cold chicken so don't let the cashier and their one cheese option fool you! 4. Total cost was about $10 down the drain for a small and a drink.  Do yourself a favor and stick to Buffalo Wild Wings for mediocre buffalo chicken."}
{"text":"Third visit here and each time I enjoy it more than the last. Simple menu, wings wraps and fries. Fries smothered with wings, delicious! My only negative comment is that I happened to carry in my own drink and was told by the employee that took my order I wasn't allowed to bring in outside drinks. It's posted on their front door-which I obviously didn't read-however, I think it's horse shit if I'm spending money on food what does bringing in an 89 cent drink matter. (pictured is the small order of buffalo fries with original hot...soooo good!)"}
{"text":"We arrived around 7pm and the place was packed!! As expected though - they just opened a few days ago. The line was almost to the restrooms.. which are located at the back of the restaurant. Fortunately, the staff was able to get the line moving pretty quickly.   The menu is pretty easy to order from. They have wings, fries, ribs and of course their famous buffalo fries. When it comes to ordering the buffalo fries, you choose the size and the sauce.   We ordered a large order of the spicy sriracha buffalo fries and a large order of the mild. We split it between four people and it was more than enough! Both flavors tasted very similar, but the spicy sriracha was a little more enjoyable since it had a hint of sweetness to it.  The ranch that they drizzle on top complemented it pretty well- if you can get an extra side I'd recommend doing so!  The staff did their very best and overall they did great. I overheard the manager explain that it was much busier than they anticipated it to be. Props to the crew!  We live in Tucson so we probably won't be back anytime soon. But I think it was worth the drive and wait time. Hopefully the hype will die down by our next visit!"}
{"text":"The menu is simple which is nice. The fries are tasty and thick!! The chicken could have been seasoned more with the pineapple jalape√±o sauce. I should have gotten cheese added to it. Overall they are average"}
{"text":"Update: not very filling. I got 10 boneless wings but they were small. There would have to be a real reason for me to go back to this place instead of going 1 mile up the road to Buffalo Wild Wings. They tasted good it just wasn't very filling as a meal.   Upon arriving 10 minutes before they close they were very friendly and a little busy still. A clean nice establishment. Everyone was smiling. Nice that they were open until 10 on a Sunday night Not a less expensive option though 10 boneless wings $12.95"}
{"text":"First time visit. Ordered the World's famous buffalo fries which were interestingly good. The regular size was enough for 2 people. Very reasonably priced for the portion size. Looking forward to eating out here again to try different menu items."}
{"text":"I went in for my first time and it will be my last. I spent 14 on onion rings a drink and a wrap they call a burrito. The cost is not the issue. Its the fact i ordered the pinapple jalapeno sauce for the wrap. After i started taking a bit i noticed it was super dry. I asked for some extra sauce cause it was dry and i was told i would have to purchase more sauce if i wanted it. I explained it was dry and he says its our policy. So its your policy to make it dry to force people to buy more sauce... Never going there again."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for chicken and French fries. The chicken and fries were both crispy and fresh. This was my first time here so the person taking my order let me try a couple options. The pineapple jalape√±o sauce was sweet with a tiny bit of heat and the chipotle had a nice chipotle flavor that was creamy and a tiny bit spicy. The food came out pretty quickly as well. No complaints!"}
{"text":"The buffalo spot is pretty good I had the jerk chicken over fries. The flavor was good but the jerk sauce wasn't spicy at all. The place was pretty packed the guy at the counter was nice and helpful all in all it was a good place and I would go back"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. Not sure if this was just not my lucky night or....  purchased a full rack of ribs and 15 wings ...carrots only, blue cheese and nothing else.  First surprise was the horribly expensive price! For fast food!?  $44 - see receipt!  Second surprise was the 40+ minute wait when there was no rush. In fact there was only in order in front of mine and they were done eating by the time I got my order. Three other families received their food after mine. I was never approached and there was no apology. No one even offered me a soda and I was sitting alone right next to the counter waiting for my order to go.  The third was the portion sizes. The full rack was less than 10 ribs. And the wings were accurately sized but the sauces were boring - no spice in the chipotle and no pepper or lemon flavoring in the lemon pepper.  What a let down."}
{"text":"OVERHYPED AND A DISAPPOINTMENT.   Heard about this new chicken and fries place and knew i HAD to try it. At first I wanted to get the small, but I changed my mind and got the regular because I was expecting it to be THAT good. The regular size is definitely a large portion. It filled an entire large square to go box. It looks AMAZING, crispy fries, popcorn chicken under drizzled sauce. But let me tell you, the taste was NOT EVEN CLOSE to what it looks like. I regret not getting the small. The fries are HARD, like cardboard. That taste like it was sitting there under the heat lamp for hours. The taste of you tried to microwave your leftover fries...twice...maybe three times. Not soggy, just hard and bland. No salt at all, which would be fine if it was saucy. The sauce barely covered the chicken. The chicken was good, too bad the chicken pieces were SO SMALL that it seemed like I was just eating breadcrumbs. Over all it was dry, hard, and disappointing.   I really thought this place was going to be good since I see so many high reviews. Maybe this was an off day. But I expected better. I went during lunch, when lines were long and literally threw away 3/4 of my whole $10 box. Such a waste of my money."}
{"text":"Went to this spot because my kids say how good it is! First thought is the staff was friendly and place was clean. Ordered buffalo fries with cheese. It was  good but not sure what all the hype about the food was. It literally was fries, chicken, cheese and sauce.  What bothered me was the cheese was on top of chicken so it was not melted and they serve the sauce cold. You are putting cold sauce on your hot food. My suggestion would be to put the cheese on fries and serve sauce at room temperature ."}
{"text":"Ordered Chipotle buffalo chicken fries and failed to put the chipotle sauce ... then they tried to say that it was my fault that I didn't check . Not an I'm sorry or come back and we will make it right but a well you should have said something! They tasted ok but definitely needed the sauce .. you need to check before you leave..."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. Glad they finally came to Az. Quick service, clean eating and ordering area. But after being here twice now here's what I've learned! If you're not sharing with another person, get a small order. If it's not saucy enough just ask for your sauce on the side in a medium container. Voila. And if your ordering to go, order all sauces on the side! It gets soggy quick. Chicken is crispy, sauces are good. Ranch is the bomb.com and the secret sauce is yummm. Good place overall"}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly associates ! The food did delay because the line was long but the wait was worth it. It was my first time there and the associate offered me the sauce to taste to make sure that's what I wanted. It also was very clean taking into account that it was after their lunch rush."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I thought this place would be too overhyped and maybe it is, but let me tell you though, those fries were so crispy and good. I was amazed. The buffalo chicken was delicious as well, just small bitesize pieces. We went during a time where it wasn't as packed so we got our food in like 5-10 minutes which was great! Customer service was quick and decent. They did their job and got the order done, didn't expect anything more than that. Overall, we would definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"I come here when im craving a little more than a snack but less than a meal. Its great chicken buffalo and fries:) yummy!"}
{"text":"I drove for 30 minutes to come get my food in my the rain to find out this spot was freaken closed, in the future make sure to fucken update you're open/closed status online!"}
{"text":"I first tried their buffalo fries here and it was good! However, I wish they give a bit more buffalo chicken with the fries. I went on Saturday night so I believe it was pretty busy. The line went by quick and the food did not take that long either. Their water cups are really tiny though...   One thing I dislike is that there is a code for the restroom. You have to go to the front and ask one of the workers to unlock it. They have a button that they click up front and it unlocks the restroom for you.   The problem that I had with that was I was trying the get the attention of the guy that's giving people their orders. I stood in front of the counter waiting so I can ask him to unlock the restroom but he was way too busy and did not attend to me. I waited for a while then I just stopped him and ask if he can unlock it.. HE JUST LITERALLY STARED AT ME AND CONTINUED ON DOING WHAT HE WAS DOING. Ignoring what I asked. I was so angry then. I had to wait a long time till I was able to get the attention of another person to unlock it for me.   If they know that they are a busy place, they should hire more workers or have their restrooms to be normal restrooms!!!! That experience definitely lowered my rating for the place."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. I enjoyed their pineapple jalape√±o buffalo fries. They have 14 different sauces and they all seem pretty good. The place was really clean and put together and I saw the staff clean and organize during down time. I love knowing that where I am at, the staff took the time to clean and prepare for me and others. They offer wraps and salads too! Great soda machine!"}
