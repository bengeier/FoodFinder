{"text":"The atmosphere was friendly, the food good, large servings and reasonable prices.  The village salad was excellent, with great olives and lots of feta cheese.  The tzatziki and the spiced fries were also standouts.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch with a large group.  Empty establishment was worrisome, but concerns quickly dispelled.   Server/owner very friendly and clearly passionate about his cuisine. Started with appetizer of 4 dips served alongside warm toasted pitas. So good!! And the taramasalata was the best I've ever had! Ordered a chicken souvlaki pita with fries.  Delish... chicken was succulent and juicy. The servers' suggestion of feta and greek spices on the fries was the bomb! A peer ordered the soup. He received industrial sized portion that could have fed 4. Great Greek food that supercedes typical greektown. Portion size - generous. Service - effusive but with good intentions. Definitely returning the next time I'm in the hood."}
{"text":"Welcome to Beach Hill! What a treat to have a less than 10-minute walk to lovely food. Zante serves fresh, flavourful Greek food in generous portions with a friendly, attentive owner on site. Their calamari is fantastic (thick, hand cut, fresh) as is the appetizer order of dips. DELISH! Mains were excellent. Their lamb done rare is just wonderful. We ate dinner with my father, who is the pickiest of picky Portuguese Dads. He declared his lamb chops OUTSTANDING. The resto is still brand-spanking new, so they're still working on refining some kitchen and serving issues (a couple of dishes could have been hotter, while the dish we were waiting on was fresh off the grill). A few minor serving issues will also come along (i.e. ensure appetizer plates are on the table, regularly remove empty dishes between courses etc.) But, all that said,  DO try this fantastic local spot, nurture and support them, and we'll soon have a five star Greek spot in the 'hood :)"}
{"text":"The salad was the best part of the visit. The waitress didn't offer drinks before  the beginning of the meal. She took our orders and was not particularly forthcoming when we asked a few questions about portions and sides. We muddled through the order and waited a fairly short time for the actual meals arrived. No garlic bread nor an offer of any. When the dishes were removed from the table, the waitress came and presented us with the bill. Without the offer of coffee or dessert. So we went across the street to a fabulous Hungarian restaurant for coffee, dessert and a very pleasant rest of the evening. I am taking Zante off my list. There are plenty more Greek restaurants not far from here. I will go to Greektown next time."}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighborhood and stopped in on a Friday night. The owner came up and personally greeted us and gave us a tasty dessert at the end of the meal.  We ordered the dolmades and 2 chicken souvlakis with a salad. Both were well portioned and delicious.  The prices are fair here, 2 meals, an app, and 3 glasses of wine for $45! Will definitely be coming back for takeout and to sit down with family."}
{"text":"Service was beyond expectations!! They were so lovely and the food was delicious!! I ordered the lamb pita and the lamb was cooked to perfection and had ample flavour. I also got the greek fries which were great. I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Great Greek Food! The owner and staff were very friendly. I will be back again. Very reasonable. I had the chicken souvlaki and my friend had the lamb souvlaki, both delicious. A small place with BIG flavors."}
{"text":"Good for quick take out but if you've got more time and are willing to go a bit farther afield there's better Greek on the danforth. The portion sizes are very generous. The salad is lovely and fresh but the dressing is quite bland, needs a splash of brightness.   The souvlaki dinner is decent and again the portions are enormous but I found the pork to be rather dry.   Will definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"The perpetual Yelp dilemna, find a new place with good food, want to share it enough to stay in business but not bring so much attention that it gets overrun....  Tired of the hassle of the Danforth when looking for good traditional Greek food?  How about free parking and no lines (at least as long we keep it quiet....)....then this is the place for you...  This comfortable 30 seat location is simply decorated but that keeps the focus on the food, another one of those times when its too bad that Yelp doesn't allow for rating of food and service separately, the food was quite good, particularly the appetizers (dip combo, dolmades and spanakopita this time out) while the service needed some help, giving the benefit of the doubt on the latter though, as we showed up on their third day of business so hopefully it improves.  Mostly simple things like clearing the table and keeping the water glasses filled.  Since we live just a couple blocks away we'll definitely be back, hopefully with the need to upgrade the rating.  Are we giving up on Greektown as a result? Not a chance, there are a few places there with better food and service, but most certainly an appreciated addition to the area."}
{"text":"Love this place. Incredible Greek salad and delicious burger. The chicken souvlaki dinner is fantastic as well. Great price for a great meal. Huge portions as well."}
{"text":"New to the area we took a party of twelve for a special family event. Petros and his team did a great job, and his Mom even made a special Greek dessert. A must visit in the Upper Beaches!"}
{"text":"Very good Greek food! A welcome addition to the neighborhood. Nice family restaurant with fair prices. You can see that the food is prepared with great care."}
{"text":"These guys are great.. We called 10 minutes before they closed for pick up and they were totally accommodating, even though I was worried about being \"those customers\" lol  We took home a chicken souvlaki on a pita with fries and the Zante Burger with a side of greek Salad. Oh and the calamari.  Everything was super fresh and delicious. The calamari was definitely hand cut and battered.. just amazing.   Go there. Right now.  The food is great, the service is amazing.. and definitely get the soda in the glass bottles.  Peter is right, it is better that way."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, fast takeout with large portion!! We ordered Zante burgers - roasted red peppers and goat cheese, need I say more?? YUM!! Highly recommend Zante, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Such a welcome addition to the neighbourhood! Warm people running the place and great food! Try the Zante Burger, roasted red peppers topped with goat cheese on a giant home made pattie and of course their Souvlaki dinner are good portions and bang on!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, generous portions, personal service from the owner. The calamari was the best I have ever had anywhere.  They buy everything fresh every day, and it shows.  Lamb was perfect, and a large portion.  I was only in town for the weekend, but if I lived in the area, I would be a regular.  We had an appetizer plate that was wonderful too.  Only downside was with the generous portions and a free dessert, I ate waaaay too much.  Try it - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So really wanted to love this place as it's a 10 min walk from my mom's plus we love Greek food and there seems to be less and less good Greek food in the city.  We went on a Monday night and aside from two pick up orders, we were the only customers, the entire night.  Waitress was nice, brought over water right away, and we kind of just launched into our order.  Asked what the soup was, she said lentil, I said great I'll have that as long as it's gluten free and I'll have the chicken souvlaki dinner, no rice, no feta.  My mom said she'll have the same but feta was fine.  Again, we're the only people in there... she needed to go write this down.  No drinks btw.  They brought our salads right away, VERY small, very bland with cheap canned pitted olives.  Bad sign.  Then the waitress said there \"might\" be gluten in the soup, as they use a chicken broth, so they don't know.  Seems like an important thing to know but I guess it's not important to them so I skipped the soup.  30 mins later (and again, we're the only people there) our food arrives.  Not sure what took so long.  The chef brought out the food himself and of course, the order is wrong, even after she wrote it down.  Mine is correct but they put rice in my mom's plate.  Since we had waited so long and were starving we said don't worry about it.  Her plate looked correct, mine was a small pile of chicken and then about 20 pieces of potato.  He asked if we wanted hot sauce.  I've been going to Greek restaurants for about 30 years, this is the first time I've been asked that.  We declined.  Then the waitress came and asked us if we wanted hot sauce.  We declined again.  There is no doubt the food was very fresh and unlike most Greek restaurants, wasn't overly salty which was great.  The chicken was the best thing on the plate, wish there had been more of it but my mom's said hers tasted burnt.  The potatoes, all 20 pieces, were flavourless.  Fresh, but without taste.  Rice pretty much the same story as I had some of my mom's.  Suddenly it made sense why they were pushing the hot sauce on us, they wanted the food to have some flavour.  The tzatziki, if you can call it that, was the worst I've ever had.  Pretty sure it was sour cream based (yuck) and way too light on the garlic.  Such an important part of the meal and I had to just put it aside, what a waste.  After taking our plates she asked if we wanted dessert, of which they had baklava and I reminded her again... don't do gluten.  I work in the service industry so I believe in tipping well but I went a little light tonight since the food took so long and for two orders for two people she didn't get it right even after writing it down.  So the two dinners and some water came to $40.00.  Not a bad price but I left feeling pretty hungry.  The ambience is great, the food is very fresh, the waitress is very nice and the prices are fair.  The food is too flavourless for my taste, the tzatziki is downright gross, the chef is over friendly, comes across fake as I think he knows the food isn't so hot and the waitress, while nice, couldn't get two orders right and of course, 30 mins when we're the only two there, is not right.  We won't be back which is a shame as the foundation is solid.  We'll stick to our usual spot, Green Eggplant on Queen Street.  We went due to the reviews here but we've noticed a lot of the food people are raving about are the sandwiches.  We also believe, for this area, this is a stand out joint with fresh food.  They just don't do Greek entree's very well."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery using uber eats, and the food was outstanding!!  We ordered chicken souvlaki on a pita, a large Greek salad, and spaghetti with meat sauce. We will definitely order from here again soon!"}
{"text":"Food quality is good but they need to work on the portion size.   When you're paying 20 dollars for a chicken souvlaki dinner the portion size should reflect that.   Can't help but feel a bit ripped off."}
