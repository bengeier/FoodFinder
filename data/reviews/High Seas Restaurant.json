{"text":"The fish is so delicious but don't expect low calories or fat. If you're watching your figure this is a once-a-month kind of place. Good prices, excellent service, sinfully good food."}
{"text":"Sitting at the side table allows you a view to the line chefs. I love watching how the process works. High Seas is a Greek diner that specializes in fish and chips and they do it very well. No surprises here but what you get hits all the right notes. Light batter, firm halibut filet, chunky fries, deep rich gravy. Definitely not an everyday place to get a bite but if you're in Etobicoke don't bother with a corporate restaurant. Come here and get a great meal made by people that know exactly what they're doing, and get warm and friendly service. Can't recommend this any more."}
{"text":"My band mate just brought me to this place for all day breakfast. Very great place. It was very homey and lovely. The fries were crispy which I loved. It's very hard to find a nice crispy fry place. The server was very nice. I'll likely come back."}
{"text":"Why does this place only have 2 reviews?? 

Beats Frescos hands down.  

I had the halibut and salad and it was the best fish I've had in Toronto... Fish was thick  juicy and batter was thin, crispy and delicious..
Greek Salad... Very well done...

Good location as well but I guess not from a hipster perspective... Ssshhhhh don't tell them how good this place is."}
{"text":"Highly recommended by my fianc√© for their fish and chips and got to say that the halibut and also cod were extremely cooked good. Light batter as noted in reviews but mine had some crunch. The fries were done well but it's a shame I wasn't able to try their gravy and their coleslaw was really good after a pinch of salt (my own preference). We came in with an hour left till closing so I didn't feel like the service was great as I had to approach the counter a few times just to ask for a glass of water but that's probably due to them closing and wanting to get home but were really polite. Other than that I would highly recommend this place for their fish and chips."}
{"text":"You should try this place atleast once ..Old school f&c restaurant, decor clearly out dated but fairly clean!!. 
Restaurant - 3/5... 
Portion sizes were good. and identical, a little bit pricey, especially if on a budget but that's the way halibut swims in these waters. In my opinion, for absolutely... THE BEST Fish and Chips in Etobicoke - perhaps in all of the GTA..give this place a look. It is definitely worth a few extra loonies for the food and great service....I will be returning - sooner rather than later!! 
Food - 7/5  
Total Price: $45.00 (tx incl) + Tip 
2 Molson Canadian (naturally!!) 
2 Halibut and chips (askfor lemon slices) 
1 Bread & Butter"}
{"text":"Looks like a very popular place... Good crowd of rather seasoned folks is some indication of quality....
Prompt and friendly service, delicious fish with light batter, and oh those tasty fresh cut fries, good coleslaw. They also serve sandwiches, hamburgers, hot dogs... By the time I wrote this - the place is packed, but it's Friday after work; good location, next to Tim Horton's. They serve beer, too. Just wish other restaurants learned what prompt and efficient service is, not to mention excellent food."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I sometimes hit up High Seas Fish & Chips on Fridays in the colder months when we feel like being guilty.  It's your typical diner/dive that serves old school burgers, fish and chips, souvlaki, etc. with a lot of locals eating and drinking beer - much nicer on the outside than the inside but still clean.

The food is pretty decent and there's a large menu selection; albeit, I usually stick to just a cheeseburger.  A couple of my colleagues love that they serve breakfast all day.

What I really like about this establishment is the excellent customer service and the genuine friendliness of the owners.  That being said, rather than going to Harvey's, Burger King or McDonald's, why not support a local Etobicoke business.  Prices and the quality of the food would be no comparison to any fast food joint.  

Note that it's cash only."}
{"text":"They make really good fish and chips! Something about the batter. Amazing onion rings as well. A true mom and pop shop with all the charms that come with it.   Super friendly people making good tasty food. Into it!"}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the best \"old school\" Greek food diners in Etobicoke. Serving all-day breakfast, burgers and fries, souvlaki, fish and chips, and more. Some of the tastiest food comes from reliable restaurants like this one! 

We came in for the fish and chips, and were happy to see so many other options on the menu. If variety is the spice of life, you can dine on a smorgasbord of offerings here! They serve delicious Greek food too, so no need to trek all the way to Greek town if you're craving a fresh Souvlaki dinner in Etobicoke. 

Unpretentious, fast and friendly service. The smiling server and staff made us feel right at home here. It's great to see everyone working here enjoy interacting with customers. Don't be shy to ask the staff questions either, in doing so we discovered the secret to longevity, of which a Mediterranean diet is a large part!"}
{"text":"Great little stop for breakfast or the classic fish and chips.  Definitely a mom and pop shop that go the extra mile to make you smile.  Reasonable prices and you won't leave hungry.  Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"Really delicious chicken souvlaki. However, I've seen how they warmed up rice in the microwave. Hope it was caused by the huge crowd that was waiting for the food during the lunch."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the fish n chips on Saturday, a great portion size and delicious food. It was a take out order that was timely. I will be going here again."}
{"text":"Dropped in because of the reviews. Service was extremely polite and kind however the batch of halibut my boyfriend and I ate weren't the greatest. I must say I liked the light and fluffy but crunchy batter. However, I did find it a little too salty and the fries weren't the greatest. On the other hand the coleslaw was pretty tasty. Overall, my rating reflects on my experience with the restaurant - average."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews are usually right... But not in this case. 

Fish was terrible.  Had a strong fishy flavour.  It must have been frozen, not fresh, or very poor quality.  Because fish should never taste fishy! 

The batter was good.  But it's the fish that matters!  And the prices are just as high as any other fish place, so there's no excuse for crap fish! 

I had a side Greek salad, which has was good, albeit under-dressed. 

They also refuse to take debit OR credit cards.  Which is ridiculous!  What store doesn't take debit cards?  It's not 1980, is it?"}
