{"text":"Best pizza in Port Credit. That's really the only thing I can say about it. Not the busiest place-except during the lunch hour at the nearby private school-so the service is always exceptional. The pizza is fantastic.  Stray away from the many chains in Port Credit, and wander down Lakeshore. Friendly staff, and great food."}
{"text":"Great Canadian (GCP) is right by my high school and we would always go get a slice before lunch ended.  I live in Brooklyn now, which is a great place to get pizza, and I have to say the pizza at GCP is a high competitor for places like Grimaldi's.  Port Credit residents are lucky to have such a nice, family owned business in the area.  The family that owns the business are so friendly and happy to do anything.  They have served me coffee, ice cream and even muffins countless times.  Just a tip for non-students: Rush student times are 11:40-12:30, so watch out, there are HUGE lines! Also another tip: drenching the cheese pizza in the red hot sauce makes it so yummy!!"}
{"text":"I don't frequent the Port Credit/Mineola area as much anymore, but this is a great local pizza spot from my experience. It's a nice place to eat if you are sitting in, they have booths. Now to the pizza, it is the good old greasy pizza with a decent crust. I'm pretty sure it is a family run establishment and it has a very friendly staff. If you visit two or three times, they will definitely remember you and make you feel at home. The pizza is much better than the surburban infested pizza pizza (it tastes like cardboard, why is it so successful?), do try it if you live in the Port Credit/Mineola/Cawthra/Lorne Park area."}
{"text":"One Of my top choices for pizza in Mississauga. Friendly owner and staff, excellent pizza and topping. These folks do it right just the right amount of sauce on top of their delicious multi crust dough. Also the place had gone through a renovation recently, very nice."}
{"text":"Great only if you like thin crust pizza.  Nice clean establishment.  The pizza slices looked like thick crust.  Don,t know why my pizza pie came out thin?  The pizza was very tasty however."}
{"text":"It's fine for what it is.  My opinion of Great Canadian Pizza hasn't really changed over the years. Every time I visit, I leave thinking the same thing - \"could have been better\".  If I were to rate this place solely on the service and restaurant itself, it would be a four-star joint easily. I just visited today to grab a slice on a lunch break and met someone (the owner's wife?) who was very friendly and wanted to converse about some of the local festivals. Likewise, the establishment is clean and somewhat sparse, but it has a nice vibe to it and is usually quiet outside the busy periods.  The pizza, however, is underwhelming in virtually every aspect. I paid $10 for two \"quarter-size\" slices, which consisted of more bread than anything else. It looks visually appealing from a distance, but you bite into it and find that there isn't much there. Despite wolfing down two of these (a deluxe and Hawaiian), I still felt hungry.  I've always been the type to suggest shopping and buying from local vendors whenever I can help it, but I feel like this isn't the best value for the money. I could walk down the street and get three slices from Pizza Pizza for the same price, or walk the same distance over to Amadio's and get a huge pizza with more than enough slices for sub-$20.  I see why Great Canadian has stayed in business for so long. It's the de facto hangout for the kids from Mentor College, who walk a block down and flood the place at lunchtime. And yes, there is a certain value if you're in a hurry and in the area.  That said, I feel like there are better options for the money in the immediate area."}
{"text":"This place is as the star rating says A-OK in my books! I grew up Italian so Italian cuisine is certainly something near and dear to my heart. When I eat something as simple a a a bowl of pasta or a pizza I look for how close it is to mommas. Or nonnas!  GCP is a great pizza joint for the port credit east area. They offer drop in slices as well as an expanding menu of Italian fare.   I want to give them a higher rating but as of my last visit I had only eaten a slice of pepperoni and cheese and a pop. The price was great and the pizza met the basic standards of good 'za. Fresh dough, good sauce and fresh ingredients.   I fully plan on returning and ordering more of their menu so I can upgrade this review. But as of this review, if you're in the port credit area, I'd recommend you pay them a visit."}
{"text":"Forget ordering a slice of pizza, I always order my own personalized pizza pan when I come here. You have to wait longer for it to cook, but its totally worth it. Fresh, thin crusted, and delicious just like I like. Theres something about watching them make my pizza from just pizza dough, makes it all the more tasty!"}
{"text":"3.5 rating  A nice, simplified place where you essentially build your own pizza with descent quality toppings. Good service and I think and owner/manager was on shift when I visited.  For reasons I can't really articulate, it's missing a little something in taste in order to bump up the rating to 4. With that said, it's still worth trying and others may feel it has more than enough to be considered a great place."}
{"text":"Not a bad pizza joint - clean, big, open, friendly staff and decent food.  I think that's really all you can ask for in a pizza parlour.    Came here with a fellow Yelper before a comedy festival in Port Credit for a quick bite.  I was satisfied.    Atmosphere:  4/5 = it feels like they are trying to copy the Grand Electric vibe, but lite.  They had plenty of tables and seats and there was lots of space between the tables so you can carry a conversation without hearing other people.  Unlike the some of the newer, trendier places in Toronto, they don't do communal dining (and why is this a thing now? Asians have been doing it for years when restaurants get busy).    Service: 5/5 - it's really self serve, order at the counter and they'll bring it to you.  However, staff was so friendly and even for drinks, it's sort of the honour system.  Tell Grab a drink, tell them what you took and then pay for it along with your food when you  pay the cashier at the end of your meal.  Trust is big for me and a restaurant/fast food place that has that kind of trust gets 5 stars in my book.    Food/price: 3.5/5 Great Canadian pizza is basically a Deluxe Pizza but using fresher ingredients than Pizza Pizza.  While they don't state it on the menu, they are happy to accommodate special requests such as having thin crust instead of regular, or subbing pesto sauce instead of in-house sauce (I assume this means it was homemade).  I'm not the biggest fan of pizza, but this place seemed to take pride in their ingredients and the pizza didn't make me feel bloated, so that's a plus for me.  Small pizza is a bit pricey at $12 and realistically only feeds 1.5 people.  However, I think it's great for a short quick meal and looks like a decent hang out place.  Verdict: worth a try if you are in Port Credit, just like almost any other restaurants in Port Credit."}
{"text":"It really, honestly pains me to do this but I'm going to have to dock them a star following my last couple of visits.  In hindsight, I think I was always a little generous when it came to ranking TGCPC. It's in my neighborhood, the people are quite friendly there and the pizza was pretty good, I guess. Or at least that's what I think I kept trying to tell myself. In reality it was always \"The Pretty Good Canadian Pizza Company\", I just don't think that I could admit that.  Now I can. The pizza isn't cheap (over $20.00 for a large three topping with dipping sauce) and the quality has sunk. My biggest gripe was that they were a bit stingy with the toppings but now it seems like I'm just eating bread with a bit of cheese, sauce and a few veggies very lightly sprinkled on top. Not only this but the last time I had it, they didn't even dress the pizza to the edge...seriously, there was about a solid inch and a half separation between the crust and the cheese. Yikes.   So I don't think I'll be heading back anytime soon. If I feel like pizza and don't want to go far, it's cheaper over at the local Domino's and honestly tastes quite a bit better. I really want to support the local, independent places (and the folks are really nice here) but I'm only going to do so if I feel as though I'm even remotely getting my money's worth and I just don't think that's the case anymore. It's not even \"pretty good\" anymore. More like \"The Mediocre Canadian Pizza Company\". Too bad."}
{"text":"Living in Port Credit, I'm honestly baffled that I haven't come by this pizza place in years.  I remember coming here all the time as a child but not since I've moved back here.   My husband and I came by last night and ordered a 3 topping large pizza and some bruschetta.  The bruschetta was tasty but I felt it was missing something. The pizza was absolutely delicious! Fresh ingredients, thin-ish but not too thin crust, gooey cheese and amazing spices. First taste and I was hooked!  I was super glad we ordered a large so there was some to take home.. next day just as good!!  The staff are really nice and welcoming, the restaurant itself is huge with lot's of seating. You order ahead of time and pay at the end of your meal. The prices are decent, more than you'd pay at a chain but not crazy expensive. You pay a base fee plus a cost for each ingredient you put on the za.  I will definitely be back.  4.5/5"}
{"text":"Great people, great food, amazing service. My kids are basically being raised by GCP. Every neighbourhood should be so lucky as to have a joint like this."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with reasonable prices and excellent food. The pizza has a nice crust and fresh toppings. The pasta was a real surprise, pasta that you would expect to be served in a high end restaurant at double the price. The cream sauce is to die for!!"}
{"text":"I was a bit apprehensive due to the few, albeit good ratings, but I was not disappointed!  I thought this place was quite good.  Not exactly a traditional, thin crust like Pizza Libretto/Lo Zingaro type place, but still a solid dine-in pizzeria that's steps above Pizza Pizza/Pizza Hut.  Blech.  (Aside:  It's a shame that these chains have literally forced the old school pizzerias to shut/focus solely on takeout/delivery.)  Pre-PC Comedy Fest, fellow yelper, Bernie C. and I checked out this place.  We ordered a namesake, a.k.a. Great Canadian (sm - $12), to share and I thought it was sufficient for a dinner.  Counter staff was friendly.  Interior looks recently reno'd, somewhat dim, and contemporary, not overly lit like those chain places.  The menu offers apps/salads, pasta, a few pizzas - you can customise your own!, and build your own calzone.  Pay at the end of your meal.  Would recommend and visit again!  Parking:  There is a tiny lot behind the restaurant with marked spots for \"The Great Canadian Pizza\".  Otherwise, it's street parking, free after 5pm!"}
{"text":"When I walked through the door I was greeted with an indie looking pizza maker who looks like he should be working somewhere hip and trendy on queen street west. He was all smiles as he handed us a menu listing the toppings and pizza selections.  There panserotti was well priced at 7 dollars, and the cheapest thing on the menu so that is what I ordered. It was super yummy and about the size of a medium pizza folded over itself. The toppings were fresh and there were cool ones like asiago cheese... I recommend trying this place, but it's a little too expensive for daily endeavours."}
{"text":"Straight to the point i think this place has Great Pizza. They have a wide variety of toppings. Tastes very fresh.  Made to your order.   Not to thin   but not to thick and Prices are fair,    very friendly"}
