{"text":"This is the best shawarma and chicken I have ever tasted. I loved the service. The price was fair. And I hope the best for this restaurant because it has the best taste."}
{"text":"Boy was i happy to see a new Shawarma place open in my neighborhood, as all the ones nearby are horrible. 

Best Shawarma I have had since the good ole days of Nick's Pita on Eglinton. You owe it to yourself if you are a fan of Shawarma's. 

Keep up the great food and excellent friendly service!!

{"text":"We took the falafel 5 pieces. Really loved it. Really fresh and crunchy and the same as what I used to eat before. Love the falafel. Ate it on the way back home so didn't take a picture 

The chicken on the rock was good to eat. It wasn't salty. They ask you which condiments you want on it. The long cucumber and long radish pickles weren't that great had an aftertaste to it. Tomatoes and green pepper were fresh. The round radish didn't have any taste to it. 

The chicken with pita bread was good too except again for the above pickles. 

Looks like it's a family business. Had a bit of difficulty understanding the man serving the food due to language barrier. At the counter there was a lady and their daughter. No clients were there when we went in. Completely empty. Nice deco inside. Very clean. 

Will go back again if we need to."}
{"text":"This was a big disappointment given the hype that it was this famous chain from Dubai. Over priced in my opinion for what you get. We got cold fried chicken which had been sitting there for a while. 5pcs chicken for 20 bux. Potatoe Chips that came with the chicken had potential but they were too soggy. Shawarma was nothing special for 10 bux. Service wasn't great. Got our meal piece by piece. The best part was the falalfel which were super fresh but  came when everyone was done eating. Overall a let down. Plenty other better shawarma places in town in my opinion"}
