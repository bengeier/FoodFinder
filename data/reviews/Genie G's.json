{"text":"Great food and as is the service .
I really like the all you can eat fish and the breakfast here is awesome ."}
{"text":"Service was pleasant. But, hair in food ruined the experience. Had to fight it out to get discount for cooks hair in food. Owners speak little to no English. Wouldn't accept my coupon from Verizon. Drinks overpriced. Hash browns almost raw and cold. Eggs are good. Overall, would not return."}
{"text":"Great diner food, great diner service, great diner prices. 3 eggs, a ton of gyro meat, hash browns, and ALL YOU CAN EAT pancakes for $8.95."}
{"text":"First visit, cool little place 
 Connie is a cool lady, she's been there for years.
Food was cooked perfect, thank you kitchen! 
 People, tip your waitress! Just because it's not a fancy place, doesn't mean your server doesn't deserve a fancy tip.
 Perfect cafe food!  Got a nice bar with a tv if you don't want to sit in a booth"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and im never disappointed. I usually get the hungary man and love it. I tried the Italian omelet and was very satisfied. They don't make their own sausage but the meal was still very tasty. Good job Genie G we will be back."}
{"text":"An unexpected gem in a not so savory section of the city is how I'd describe Genie G's.  I grew up coming to this spot back in the 80' when it was CoCo's.  The decor hasn't changed and not much has been done to update the building however the old saying \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" should be applied here.  The menu is flooding with classic dinner food and remixed renditions of breakfast staples.  If you can't find something that grabs your attention and makes you think \"I gotta try that\" you should've just grabbed a bowl of cereal at home....wait never mind you can get a bowl of cereal off the menu!  A few of the specials like the one I pictured (The 75th Ave Special) have all you can eat toast AND pancakes, not one or the other.  This day the wife and I had a hankering for breakfast, which is served all day, but we will definitely be back to try other selections off the expansive menu.  The Ruben and the Patty Melt caught my attention.  Friendly service, a good cup of coffee and a delicious selection of menu items far outweighed the lack of atmosphere, which was nostalgic to me but, I could see why it would detour some."}
{"text":"Great food, took my girlfriend here for late night French toast and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was slow, older waitress liked to talk. 
I had the 79th Avenue special. As in other reviews the food was cooked the way you asked. I ordered over easy eggs , they were perfect! Asked for my potato's to be cooked crispy.... they were perfect! The only big disappointment was the gyro meat. It wasn't off the cone. It was pre packaged and pre sliced. Anyone who knows Greek food knows the best gyro meat is off the cone. For that reason I only gave it four stars.
My compliments to the Chefs"}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem on yelp, and I'm glad we did. I had the gyro breakfast plate & it was delicious! My fianc√© had the steak breakfast & it was cooked perfect! Service was the best & pricing was great too!!!!"}
{"text":"Gennie G is a great place to eat for breakfast. There food is fresh and the service is great. They kinda make you feel like family. Although I only ate there for breakfast I'm planning on visiting for lunch or dinner one day, and im sure it will be great."}
{"text":"I eat at this diner alot because I own a business in the area. 
The food is consistently good with large portions.
It is a simple menu with good home cooked type meals. 
If you are looking for a full belly on a tight budget with a good selection this will be for you :)"}
{"text":"Food is good but not mind blowing good! Honestly is equivalent to home cooking! But it's cheap GREAT portions & good customer service! they claim to serve gyro but it's a joke! I go back for the hungry mans special for $7.99 I get 3eggs, hash browns, 3 slices of bacon, 3 sausages all u can eat pancakes & toast! That's a great little mom & pops breakfast joint! Good for a cheap budget!"}
{"text":"Tried a new special on my 1st visit here. Ordered a tea and was told it was freshly brewed, however it did not taste that way. My pancakes were fluffy and delicious as were my eggs and sausage. American fries are slice potatoes FYI.

I will visit again and will continue to explore the menu

The manager on duty when I went was very rude to her teammates/waitresses."}
{"text":"Went back Sunday morning for breakfast and while it was a lot busier this time we didn't have to wait long and the food came out very quickly. They have the best egg cook I've ever seen. Eggs come out a perfect over medium every time and look so pretty.

Love this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Came in here for breakfast awhile back.first impression I noticed it was seemed to be a regular spot for the elderly :) service was good , waitress was friendly and helpful.  Im a big breakfast person myself & the food definitely met my expectations! Prices are reasonable but overall great service and food ! Would recommend :)"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast before hitting the road back to Vegas.  Located off of Indian School Road, its easy to find with plenty of parking.

The building itself is older and the decor on the inside reflected its age.  Upon entering we were greeted immediately.  We were able to choose any place to sit.  Our waitress was amazing.  She was so friendly with us during our visit.  I think she knew just about every customer that walked through the door.  Needless to say there were many regulars visiting for breakfast.  

I ordered the Spinach & Feta egg white omelet.  Our waitress informed me there was also mushrooms, onions and tomatoes inside.  Sounds good to me!  I chose the hash browns for my side with sourdough toast.  The cook that morning was quite efficient.  Our breakfast was out in a flash.  The omelet was so tasty with the yummy ingredients.  The hash browns were cooked perfectly.  There was a lot of food sitting in front of me for $7.99.   My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy.  A huge portion for only $3.99.  

Everything had low prices for an abundant amount of food. I would have no problems stopping back in for breakfast."}
{"text":"We love to go to little diners for breakfast. They were busy when we came in but we got a table right away. Our food took a while to come out when it did it looked like a hot mess. The hash browns were so burned and crispy you could only eat the top which was not very much. Our omelettes were pretty good but that was the only positive. Our waitress never brought us our toast even after we reminded her. When we paid we let the cashier know and he gave us a discount"}
{"text":"Have been here about 3 times.  Want to like it but have been disappointed each time.  Eggs have been greasy and gross.  Bacon way overdone.  Burgers so so.  We tried enchilada and was mucky ground beef.  Chipped plates.  Silverware that needs to be replaced.   Want to like this place as we love diners with counters and this is on way to work but no bueno.  Pancakes are the best thing we've had here.  Waitresses are very friendly."}
{"text":"My family and I have have been coming here for years. We actually had stopped here on accident because the outside was a turn off, but OOOOHHHH what a diamond in the ruff this place has turned out to be. Don't let the exterior turn you off. For 6 yrs this place has served me and my extended family and we don't like this place, we LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at Genie G's and it was GREAT!  Our first time there and we'll be returning! Soooooo much good food, great coffee, and all for a decent price. Our waitress was very nice, personable, and checked on us often! I will be recommending to every one I know."}
{"text":"I love finding these small spots on Yelp. This place was delicious, and different. I had the 75th Ave Special, with eggs, and hash browns and gyro meat! Yes, gyro meat! Talk about different AND delicious. Plus, it came with pancakes that were buttery heaven. Portion sizes are so big, and I was glad about it because I didn't want it to end. The service was awesome too. Every one was very friendly and welcoming. Cant wait to come back with the kids and try another something new."}
{"text":"Places is not that good went in for some biscuits and gravy and was very disappointed the food was hot but lacked flavor also ordered a side of hash browns and they were under cooked price if the food is not bad but I didn't even finish my food and I felt nauseous I usually give place a second chance but I will not be going back to this establishment"}
{"text":"That old lady that is 80 is very disrespectful to everyone, if I was the owner she would be removed from that restaurant, I don't know what the owner is thinking?  I think her name is Connie yelling all over the restaurant , very mean not good for business at all? I will be back !"}
{"text":"Wow, can't believe this has not been reviewed. I woke up early this morning and called my neighbor up and asked him, \" you ate breakfast yet?\". Thank The Lord, he said  \"no\".  So he drives out his drive way and into mine, off we go. I mentioned Denny's and Ihop to him, he says to me, \" I know a place\", and we are on the freeway headed to the west side. This place is no joke, awesome food and service. Very reasonable prices and all the food has great flavor. I had the Hungry Man breakfast, $7.50 for all you can eat pancakes, six sausages, hash browns and three eggs. Me and my neighbor are big guys and can eat, this will fill you up. If you want a home cooked breakfast, at a very reasonable price, this is the place."}
{"text":"Food was ok more or less nothing to special fortunely it did not cost to much"}
{"text":"If you want a great breakfast in a comfy place.  Genie G's is the place.  It's the perfect place for a weekend breakfast. I've had most things on the menu and I'm never disappointed.  Friendly ladies working here too."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times now and I totally love it. Great food and it has a diner atmosphere. I only came here because of other yelp review and am soooo glad I did! I have had the omlette and French toast and they are both great. The portions seems large, like what you would expect at a family, small-town diner.  It was not that long of a wait even when it was busy, definitely worth it. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Good down to earth atmosphere. Waitress was very friendly.  Price was fair. Good variety and food was good."}
{"text":"Good food and generous portions. Service is good. Price is the justification for a 4 star rating. Breakfast and the burgers are damn good."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend on a Sunday. The place was pretty full-- an older crowd and a few families. The servers were sweet older ladies and the they did a great job! The food was average, I had the biscuits and gravy. The  cost was reasonable and I left full! Wouldn't kill to go back, but it's a nice place if you're in the area looking for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great staff - funny old timer men sitting at the bar.  Like a Denny's but all locals in there.  Food was good - very Denny'ish.  You get what you expect when you walk up.  Good food & a few good laughs listening to the old timers give each other a hard time."}
{"text":"Service was great . Place is outdated and In need of renovating food was good . Prices were great"}
{"text":"What a great little place for breakfast. I stumbled on this place by accident. The staff were awesome and my server was so fun and interactive.

Everything is very reasonably priced and my meal was delish. If your on the west side and looking to break away from the chains, give this quaint breakfast diner a shot. I enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"Totally brings you back to the good ol days when you brought the family too have a big breakfast. You can never go wrong with the breakfast. Service is great, Connie is an awesome waitress, always making sure drinks and belly are full :-). We love the atmosphere, the breakfast, and the service."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Saturday. It looked like it was closed from the outside, which should have been my first clue. There's a small foyer between to doors at the entry. Clue #2-it was filthy. Inside, the front room was all booths from the seventies. To get to the tables in the back room, we had to pass the bathrooms, which reeked. Still, we stayed. Our waitress was very nice, but her shirt was stained and filthy. The iced tea was good and she kept our glasses filled. My friend's salad was fresh and large. She said that the turkey club was \"okay\". My \"hot\" beef sandwich was luke warm, the beef was processed, the gravy was out of a can and gelatinous, and the mashed potatoes were instant with garlic powder added. It was disgusting. We shall not return!"}
{"text":"That's right, I'm giving this little greasy spoon 5 stars.  The food is everything you would require from a diner - tasty, hot, cheap.  

I love the atmosphere!  Think Pulp Fiction - this place makes me feel like Vincent and Jules are in the booth behind me.  It adds a fun little element when you come in hungover/still drunk for breakfast.  The service is like you'd imagine it would be - a woman passes by every 3 minutes and calls you hun while she fills your coffee cup."}
{"text":"Just moved from Ca and must say this place is pretty good.. our server Karen was very friendly.. Ordered our food.. didn't take too long.  Overall a pleasant experience :) good price for good food :) and its down the st from us ... def will come back"}
{"text":"Good breakfast friendly service reasonable prices. Old diner style place.I enjoyed my meal I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Thought this would be a great little place to eat. I was wrong just order breakfast it comes out with a huge amount of onions under the eggs hiding which I didn't order and HATE onions after first bite.I nicely asked waitress and she said sorry and sent order back in. No problem right stuff happens. But comes back out no onions on eggs so take another bite I guess the cook was to lazy to cook new meal had a load of onions on it but didn't figure that after I took a bite of it. So just told her thanks then she charges me $5.50 so thanks for losing a customer"}
{"text":"Worst costumer service ever. I ordered a veggie omelette and asked for sour cream with it. No sour cream so I waited for the last for over 30 minutes never came back to check on me. Horrible the sour cream was on the bill but I never received it."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast and good, simple diner food. If you don't like abrupt humor, don't listen to the servers. Funny to listen to them lovingly insult the regulars"}
{"text":"Good basic diner. Lots of menu choices. All 3 times I have been has been just as they open for breakfast. The server is really great. This isn't a place that will wow you but nothing has been poorly cooked any time I have been there and the prices are reasonable. There are always a few specials on the board."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place, after asking on Facebook  where to get a good breakfast. From the outside it looks like nothing to write home about as well as the inside, that's were the bad stops. the employees and server had such wonderful attitudes, they treated me like I was a long lost friend coming for visit. I had the Southern biscuit and gravy and it was lip smacking good, their Bacon is thick cut and cooked just right, not that wimpy flimsy stuff you get elsewhere. I will return, funny things is I live about 6 miles away and i would I  drive by all the time and I never once stopped. Like they say never judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"First time here. Don't pay attention to the listed hours saying they are closed on saturday and sunday. sat in the back room much quieter. I got the fiesta omelette and it was very good. my wife got the waffle Plus and she said it was very good. food came out fast. will go again."}
{"text":"Took about 45 minutes until we got our food and half of it was so cold it was inedible. The Denver omelette was good but the toast that came with it cold and dry and the French toast was lukewarm at best and kind of hard. Yelp failed us on this one.  Had to split my food with my wife so one of us didn't walk away at hungry."}
{"text":"The eggs and gyro plate is awesome! Comes with all you can eat pancakes. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great service, good food! Seemed like a locals place as the servers seemed to know everyone! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was fast and friendly. BUT... place was in serious need of cleaning."}
{"text":"Small local diners are my fav when it comes to breakfast and this place ALWAYS makes a great meal. We've been coming here for years, never had bad service and the food always comes right away. Any place that makes a Mickey Pancake for my baby is alright with me"}
{"text":"The food was super good and we had great service. 

Ordered the southern breakfast and a side of pancakes, my girlfriend and I split both and found them to both be excellent. 

I have to say, these were some of the better biscuits and gravy that I have gotten when eating out. 

Overall, a great place to grab some breakfast if you live close by. I am not sure if it would be worth making a long trip for, but like I said it definitely has potential to become your local go to for some good cheap breakfast!"}
{"text":"We drove out to Genie Gs for the gyro meat breakfast platter.  This place looks to be in old Cocos or Dennys.  It is a true \"dive diner\" - greasy food that will fill you up on the cheap.
We got the Breakfast Platter that included the gyro meat, 3 eggs, hashbrowns, all you can eat Pancakes AND Toast!  For $8.99 that's a steal. Our girls also were filled up with the $3.99 pancake and bacon breakfast and I finished off the 2 egg breakfast that comes with hashbrowns and toast for $5.99. 
The food was good, servers nice and price right.
I don't know if we would make a special trip again, but may stop in again if we are on the Westside."}
{"text":"Found this place by way of Yelp. This place had good reviews and was right down the street from our hotel so we came in for breakfast. 
breakfast was delish! 
I had the veggie omelette added Bacon and jalepenos and it was GREAT! Portion size was hefty, comes with toast and your choice of potato. I had hash browns. 
Service was friendly, not exactly fast but the place was busy and we weren't in a hurry! 
No complaints here, great breakfast spot!
I do reccommend!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast. They should work on the home fries, though. Add some onion and green pepper and please season them. However, if you want a true diner feel, a dilapidated but clean, real neighborhood joint feeling,  this is the place.

The coffee was okay, too."}
{"text":"A must try. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Connie and Karen are awesome waitresses. Coffee always refilled right on time. I've been here several times now. NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED. Breakfast is great basic food done right. Don't deny yourself the burgers either. Great tasting grilled to your specification. The cooks here are great. Friday dinner all you can eat  fish fry is fantastic. They also make some pretty good Mexican dishes. I sit at the counter when I'm not with my daughters. They make you feel like family. Sam the owner and I will usually discuss football. 
Known for their great breakfast, I would recommend trying the other days meals here."}
{"text":"Excellent place.  75th Ave Special is what I ordered. How often can get gyro meat with breakfast!  The prices were very reasonable ($9), coffee $1.99.  The staff was very friendly.  It felt like I was visiting a road side diner in a small, mid-western town."}
{"text":"This is a good diner. The food is tasty . The coffee is great. Been here for breakfast and lunch. Satisfied both times. Servers are friendly and fun."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Tasty coffee, love their pancakes. Old fashioned home cooking. It's a clean little diner. Dean and Sam would totally eat here. Reminds me of the episode where Dean kept dying over and over. \"Oh look! Pig n a poke!\" - that kind of place."}
{"text":"***Genie G's Does NOT accept ENTERTAINMENT BOOK coupons***

We tried out Genie G's because we had a coupon out of our entertainment book. After we ate and went to pay we found out they do not accept the coupon. Just beware.

I Had the Steak and eggs my husband had the Hungry Man's Breakfast. Everything was good. The waitress was Awesome. Great service, good food- even without a coupon, we'd go back."}
{"text":"This place has a nice small town feel to it. There were a handful of regulars (really old men drinking coffee and reading the paper) which made it feel homie and welcoming. The breakfast was good and reasonably priced. There's nothing spectacular about this place but if you want a good diner style breakfast you won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Ya comieron pobres! The place was packed and they still delivered us our food no lie 2 minutes after we ordered. Service was great, food was great, price were even better. Recommend this place to anyone who doesn't want to deal with Denny's and IHOP traffic"}
{"text":"Old school diner with good food at a reasonable price.  Nothing fancy.  The servers are friendly.  There's plenty of parking.  Reminds me of the mom and pop places I went to with my parents years ago.  I had pancakes and bacon...the cakes are huge!  If you dig diner food in a relaxed old school atmosphere...you will enjoy GenieG's!"}
{"text":"I'm making this place my Saturday breakfast spot. Hungry man special is amazing, And only 10 bucks.  Coffee here is really good dun right..strong. I really enjoy  watching all the regulars say good morning to eachother makes u feel like you're in a small town. Service is awsome and the food is great."}
{"text":"Looking for a new breakfast spot and this is it! The food was great and our server, Connie was amazing! We'll not only be returning for the food, but to see Connie as well!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food! Had the 75th Avenue special and it didn't disappoint! Lived having gyro meat with eggs! Pancakes covered in strawberries was a nice addition to the meal! Martha took Gray Cate of us! Thanks Genie G's! Positive experience all around!"}
{"text":"Traveled across the nation and stopped here for breakfast...had Karen as our serviced.  She was EXCELLENT! She was very patient, she knew the menu through and through and helped us with specials! I rarely say that a server was excellent but she was Amazing! 
The food was also very very good!!! The Greek omelette was delicious, my other half had the southern and he loved it, but he couldn't finish it, there was so much food! Hungry man's breakfast is for big men with empty stomachs and the meat lovers was a delight for Denise.  Can't say enough good things! Will be here again when we come back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Total dive diner with big, deliciously greasy portions, great service, and a good value.  Hungry Man = three eggs, six glistening bacon/sausage, hash browns/home fries, toast and all you can eat pancakes for $8.99.  You'll keep coming back and getting fatter until your mobility scooter won't fit."}
{"text":"I always love this place. My favorite meal is breakfast and nobody does it better than Genie G's!"}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast a couple days ago. Ordered the Monte Carlo (which is a Monte Cristo everywhere else) sandwich and fries. Food was pretty decent but nothing extraordinary. Service was a bit off between forgetting refills and some of the order. Not a bad place."}
{"text":"This place is like an \"old\" town country style.. hehe. A lot of elderly people here. christmas decorative and the seating is similar to dennys.

The strawberries with waffles was ober deliciously wonderful.. it was a crispy slash soft texture. Idk how to explain it. Haha it was yummm.

The veggie omlette was mediocre, the hash brown was terrible. It was soggy. I didn't like it. BUT their toast was good.  haha.. the strawberry and mixed fruit jam was tasty. :))"}
{"text":"Loved Genie G's so much that while in Phoenix the last time I ate there twice!

Great Food & Awesome Service."}
{"text":"Great experience. The service was friendly and our server was so kind to our son . The food was great as well ."}
{"text":"I love this older Diner . Don't judge this place by its cover for sure . My husband I found it by accident on our way to our shop . We stopped and had breakfast and omg  the food was better than all the other breakfast places we had been too . We love the food the cook is excellent everything cook like home made .  I'm so happy we found this place ."}
{"text":"Love coming here Sunday mornings for breakfast. Always fast and attentive service. Friendly staff. The food has good flavor & large portions! The restaurant could use some maintenance and TLC."}
{"text":"This is an older diner that serves large portions. The sassy waitress must do it all so don't be in a hurry. The omelets were good and hot but the hash browns tepid. The coffee was ok. The biscuit was homemade but reheated and tough on the bottom. The price was right for a quick road stop at $20.00."}
{"text":"Old school cute diner. I think it would be more fair of me to write a more in-depth review after the second visit. The server was nice, the menu is large and diverse and they have a specials board. 

I got a 2 egg and biscuits special which was a good deal at $3.99. Not too much food and not too small a portion. I did not think the biscuits were very good though, very dry. The gravy was okay not the best I have had. The coffee was okay and never empty. Three stars at best for service but I will go back and try something else to see if the biscuits were a fluke."}
