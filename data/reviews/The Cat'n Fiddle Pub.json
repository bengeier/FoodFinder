{"text":"Bad. I went there on a Wednesday night which is wing night. Did not order wings but had a veggie burger with coleslaw. Cheese was $1 extra (???). I'm a vegetarian, but did not pick this venue. The waitress was super busy and was barely keeping up with her tables. It looked like they were understaffed. My order took a while to arrive. When I finally got it, it was pretty disappointing. A mushy patty, a lettuce leaf, a slice of tomato and raw red onions. The bun was store bought and cold. Barely any sauce. I had to wait 15 minutes to order ketchup to season the burger. The coleslaw was just soaking in rich mayo dressing. Barely edible. I stopped eating halfway through. I don't usually do this but it was just tasteless. The waitress came back and simply asked if I was done and took me plate away. 
I was fully charged for this meal.
I politely told the waitress I was unhappy with the food as she did not ask. All she had to say is \"I'm sorry\" with a fake smile. Well so was I. Don't go there with any expections."}
{"text":"Nice little place, good wings and ribs on cheap nights... the Orgasm wings are a nice treat had a balance of salty and other flavors that just worked. The bartender Marty was fast with or drinks and had some great recommendations of other drinks and menu items to try,the crowed was a mix of SAIT students and locals. i will be going back"}
{"text":"I came here the other night because I wanted wings and they were on special for Wednesday. They were really bloody and the bigger drumsticks were uncooked. Took one bite into a drumstick and it was still raw. I told the server and she asked if we wanted another order but we just asked for the bill instead. I'm unsure whether or not the kitchen staff or manager were notified, but we were still given a full bill even though we didn't finish a lot of the wings. Luckily, we didn't get sick..."}
{"text":"The building they're in used to be a funeral parlour. You can tell it was something before because of the weird design. Some say it's haunted and not just by dipsomaniacs from the area.
It's not the cleanest pub I've been in and it's really kind of dark, but it has character. Average pub fare and the locals seem to love it. It's a neat kind of place to have a beer and a cheese and bacon sandwich (on the menu) in. Keep an eye out for real ghosts, not just people who've abused their bodies for 40 years by drinking as they hover around the VLTs."}
{"text":"We like dis pub, food always gud, do a lovely thai chicken wrap, bit heavy on d sweet chilli sauce but stil nice! Wil be back again in d future! Great specials, half price appetisers on a sunday!"}
{"text":"Food came out wrong for a member of my party. Shepard's pie was really good.  Went there on my own and the food was passable. Beer selection was good for a beer snob"}
{"text":"This used to be a great British pub with a wonderful atmosphere.  Sadly, all of this great pub atmosphere has been sucked out and has been replaced with flat screen tv's, terrible FLORESCENT lighting and overpriced & terrible food.  What a shame."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.

Tried the Sriracha-Pineapple wings and if I didn't know what flavour I ordered, I would have guessed that they were plain wings. It lacked in flavour and I wish it was marinated with more sauce. 

I also tried the Pulled Pork Poutine and it was pretty disappointing. As a native Montrealer (aka land of poutine), I have high poutine standards and this just flopped. There were not a lot of cheese curds (and we asked the waitress to put extra) and the sauce had the texture of a cafeteria surprise goop. The flavour also wasn't all that there. The waitress practically forced us to take the more expensive one as opposed to the Traditional Poutine I originally requested.

Regardless of the food, it seemed like an alright ambience. It was pretty quiet for Karaoke Night (Saturday), but seemed like it had its regulars. Might come back, might not. It seems like there are better pubs in town."}
{"text":"I was here on Wednesday ! Wings day~ 
It was good !Good for watching hockey as well"}
{"text":"I was there on a Saturday and ordered their special  $9.   steak sandwich with fries and it was amazing. The steak tasted great and was very tender."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I went here for Tuesday Night Trivia. I have never been to a Trivia night, so can't compare to other places, but Cat n Fiddle was not bad at all.

From the outside, the place looks like a dive, but once you're inside, it is quite spacious and not grimey or divey. We had a huge platter of nachos to share and it was quite good! Lots of cheese and hot peppers, and three dipping condiments (salsa, sour cream and guac), all of which are usually the stuff I look for in quality nachos.

Trivia was hard though. Damn."}
{"text":"It's formally a funeral parlour  and HAUNTED! 

I know for a fact  because the place is always dead, and the servers must be ghosts cuz no one sees them


Just kidding. GREAT PLACE"}
{"text":"If you come expecting outstanding food and service, you're going to be disappointed. However, if you come knowing that this is a pub, this spot is pretty cool. Pub fare is what you'd expect and the service is right there too. 

Basically, you come here with groups of people! And for that, this place is great! The trivia nights that are hosted here on Tuesday and Thursday are a blast. It's the most movement I've had playing trivia. You don't just sit down and shout out answers; you stand up, race around, go head to head with other plays, can tag to help out your buddies, and that's in the first two rounds! They can go pretty late, but I'm going to keep getting friends together to have some laughs and test our trivia mettle"}
{"text":"I've been a bit of a shut in lately so it was super great to get out. I love the cat and fiddle though, I have been drinking here off and on for years. It's my old man whiskey and beer pub. Calling it that will either get you super pumped, or you don't like a relaxing drinknwith friends. 
You go there shoot the breeze, shoot virtual bucks and play bar trivia. 
Good ol' fashioned pub
Also good finger food
I would give it 5 stars but parking is a nightmare, everything inside is top notch"}
{"text":"The Cat'n Fiddle Pub? Sure! Why not?

It's a good pub to go to if you're in the area. The food is consistent, the service is dandy, and it gets a few bonus points for making pretty good use of a strangely shaped ex funeral home building.  In fact that's probably my favourite part about the Cat'n Fiddle. I've heard some eerie stories about it being haunted, and it just makes it all the more exciting to be there.

They have Trivia night and Name That Tune, both of which can be a pretty fun time if you're looking for something a little different to do with a group of friends on a week day night."}
{"text":"I've recently started going to the Cat and Fiddle.

Cat and Fiddle is the home bar for the Liverpool FC Calgary group, which is why I venture all the way from South Calgary to the north every so often.

I love how welcoming they are to the group. The Capital One Cup was only going to be broadcast via an online service, but the bar hooked up a laptop for us and we were good to go with no problems.

It's pretty awesome the numbers that they get for these games at the times the games are on.

The one server/bartender who appears to always be working the LFC games is super friendly and has an uncanny memory for remembering your favourite drink.

The food is alright, but nothing spectacular. I've had better wings elsewhere but I've had way WORSE potato skins elsewhere as well.

The layout is kind of confusing but I'll chock that up to it's past occupants.

It's a great place for the LFC games, but I don't think I'd seek it out for a night out."}
{"text":"Here on a sports team event, the general attitude was \"no we can't\", I did a quick survey of our 10 people and we all agreed a 2.5

They don't serve pitchers of beers? really! The nacho salsa was not good.  Beer did hit the spot.

Overall not bad but nothing special.  Try the Regal Beagle not far away on 14 street."}
{"text":"Came for karaoke on a Friday night, but didn't get a chance to sing on account of the list being a little long. Ended up just having a couple of drinks with a friend and catching up. I can't say this was the best place for that, as it was a little loud, but C&F strikes me as a decent neighborhood pub nonetheless. Lots of scheduled activities (trivia, karaoke, darts, etc), friendly wait staff, plenty of seating, inexpensive drinks, etc."}
{"text":"A great local to call your own. The Cat 'n Fiddle has that wonderful worked in feel without the dilapidating nuance older pubs adopt. In other words, they care."}
{"text":"Cold Beer. Dart Boards. Pool Tables. Fun Trivia. Crappy food. Decent service. 

There, my review is done. That sums up Cat n Fiddle. 

No, I jest. I'll keep going. But really, this is such a classic bar, I don't even know how else to describe it. It has two large rooms with plenty of tables, and in one room there are pool tables. In the other, there are are dart boards and a couple of arcade machines. On Tuesday nights, there is trivia and on Thursdays there is 'name that tune.' I believe there is also karaoke on Fridays (or maybe Saturdays?)

The decor is dark and full of wood. It's an old funeral home, but you wouldn't notice if someone didn't point it out to you. There is a good amount of parking beside the place, and for warmer nights, there is a good size patio/beer garden.

Notice that I haven't spoken about the quality of the food, beer, or the service? Well, I am trying to set up an atmosphere here. It's a bar. It's a great place to meet up with your friends and try your hand at trivia. It's a place to have a fun night with a glass of cold beer in one hand and a very point object (ie dart) in the other. This is not the place you go to for 5-star service and gourmet food. 

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my $1 tacos and $5.50 Crown Royal (Thursday's special) as much as the next person but I wouldn't drive across town for it. I drove across town for Name That Tune and I am very happy I did. Just think of your food as ancillary to your purpose for going to cat n fiddle and I think you'll have a great time. 

I will definitely be back. I had a super fun night and I know that many, many are to be had in this funeral-home-turned-local-pub."}
{"text":"Well... This place is not beautiful, the food is Just Ok. And the service is not bad. The fact that it doesn't have so many people there let you talk to your friends easily, because is not too loud... I might go back.. But I am not going to recommend this place unless you are with a large group of friend, that you can make your own party.."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday afternoon to kill time between a wedding ceremony and the reception.  It was fairly quiet when we first arrived.  The food was good, beer came quickly, and the service was excellent.  By the time we left it was pretty busy, but the one waitress was holding her own extremely well."}
{"text":"Generally speaking this place serves overpriced substandard drinks, overpriced mediocre food, and the servers are borderline rude.

 The waitresses just seem entitled here for some reason. BEHIND the bar, they are \"OK\" but not great. The beers here weren't cold enough. They have a Pabst neon sign prominently displayed in the window, but do not serve Pabst, hahhaha! 

They have this bizarre \"smoking area\" that consists of tarps stapled over their patio, and you cannot bring your drink with you out there.

This place has a really gimped up mix of a jukebox, satellite radio, and LOUD hockey games. The pool table area is far too brightly lit for a pub, and the rafters are filled with garage sale items that do little to create any atmosphere.

The fish n chips are LOUSY, dont bother. Its frozen fish that is left in the fryer for too long because the oil isnt hot enough, therefore soaking up way too much oil. Besides, they have no flavour. Just deep fried mush really.

This place is more like a \"pub styled\" bad restaurant than an actual bar or pub."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time...and decided to try if again. A few Sundays past we decided to hit their patio as it was a hot day. Who ever decorated it did a very bad job....picnic tables  and barrels. No flowers...no effort.

So a few nights a go we returned and sat inside. The new owners have done a few renos...

As a Vegan eater I can usually find something to eat in pubs. My ONLY choice was a quesodilla( Hold the chicken and cheese ) but for the same price...NOT.

I ordered fries and a spinach salad. There was 3 chunks of deep fried avocados on it. WTF..nasty. I love avocados but this was horrible. The salad itself was drenched in the sweetest dressing I have ever had. HORRIBLE.

Service was ok although the waitress had no idea what vegan meant and kept calling it gluten free. I told her they should at least have a Vegan patty for their burger options and she shrugged and said they picked the one they have because it tastes good. She could have cared less.

Not coming back."}
