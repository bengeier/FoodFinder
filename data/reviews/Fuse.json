{"text":"Hibachi is great, sushi is good especially the New York roll. Chinese food is mediocre... Overall good place"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to hear some great music and enjoy a dance or two, or three or four.  Wonderful, mature vibe,  with friendly staff who make you feel at home.  Have been a few times and enjoyed every time.  Food is decent - duck rolls are a nice appetizer change, and prices are average."}
{"text":"Very good hibachi, soup and maki rolls. The hibachi has salmon and scallops - that is a great start to a meal in my opinion. The soup has the genuine asian taste to it with black vinegar being used I am pretty sure also a great way to start a meal. The rolls are the standout item here as they are very fancy and at a level that is nowhere else to be found in a buffet that I have seen. The short ribs are delicious. The atmosphere is modern and has lots of tables that are in a quiet location which makes for a much more pleasant dining experience than other buffets in the area. I really enjoy going to this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent, modern spot with great customer service from the moment you enter the door. Didn't get too deep into their menu because we stopped in for drinks but their Chicken Wings were great! If you're looking for a casual spot to unwind on the weekend or after work, check them out."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for months and finally decided to try it. When we walked in the food looked great and it was very busy so I thought this cant be half bad.  This buffet had a lot of seafood and very limited selection of Other Chinese foods. The egg rolls and crab rangoon were soggy and had little taste, what taste was present was gross. Initially I was impressed by the sushi until I started to eat it. The fish was slimy and the texture was not consistent with freshness. In addition to bad fish all the rolls were very similar, avocado and cream cheese in every roll. My fianc√© had hibachi steak which used low quality meat and used a vegetable mix that had green peppers. We eat hibachi often and never have we seen green peppers used. To top the night off we got our bill and it was nearly $50 for the two of us and we didn't have any alcohol on the bill. No buffet in Charlotte, NC  should ever be this expensive. If you decide to try this place, I encourage you to think twice and go somewhere else. The food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"all they got going for them is crab legs the soda is watered down and there food is bland take it from a buffet lover i finally found a buffet to hate.."}
{"text":"We found ourselves going here way too often because my parents are in LOVE with this place. This is your typical Chinese buffet place. I feel the selection is not as huge, but think that gives them more room to provide some quality dishes. They do have a better sushi selection and offer hibachi grill if you would want that. I also LOVE sesame chicken and general tso chicken and think they are #1 for these dishes in terms of buffet. 

My parents love this place because on Saturday and Sunday they serve lobster and crab legs. Unlike Tin Tin, for the rest of the family members that do not eat crab legs you will not all be charge $20+ for your meal. If you do eat crab legs it will cost about $20 and they will continuously bring you all you can eat crab legs."}
{"text":"Great experience! 
Inexpensive, good quality good, friendly staff, and quick. Great for a work meal!
I enjoyed this meal greatly!"}
{"text":"dine date 8/30/2014
 For $10.00 more you can get the all you can eat crab legs.  The problem is you cant eat them.  They are small over cooked and impossible to get any meat out of them.
We sent them back and dined from the rest of the buffet.  The sushi looked good but did not taste fresh.  The featured shell on lobster is served over cooked and in a gooey sauce that did not taste good or fresh. The staff could care less about our dining experience."}
{"text":"We have a nice dining experience at Fuse every time. Good sushi, hibachi and many other dishes. The only gripe that I have would be that the vegetables at the hibachi grill are all mixed together in a pan. Other than that I really enjoy eating here. Not to mention the service has always been prompt! I recommend fuse to anyone wanting sushi."}
{"text":"Overall, a good seafood buffet. Dinner has Crab Leg and Raw Sashimi and price is very competitive. Lunch is good money value, with 10 bucks you could take a supreme Hibachi grill plate with scallop, beaf, salmon, chicken and shrimp. The Hibachi plate and sushi tastes better than all buffet style sushi and hibachi place within 20 miles. ( I am a lover of those two). 

However, if you are fans of Panda Express type food, or a lover of American style Chinese food, or you don't like eating sushi and raw fish, then this place doesn't provide a lot of choices. 

Things I take every time:
Lunch: Hibachi with Beef, Shrimp, Salmon and Scallop, Salmon Sushi, Sea Weeds salad, tomato soup,  
Dinner: Same as lunch plus : Raw Fish Filet (sashimi) and crab legs.

For new to raw fish filet and sushi, my suggestion is taking a cup of hot tomato soup first, warm yourself up, then start those cold raw sea products."}
{"text":"food is ok.service!!?? lets just say rude!!! our server didnt say much other than how many ppl ..no refills unless we asked..!i should have listen to my friends..this place sucks!!"}
{"text":"They have a huge selection of sushi but I personally felt that they all tasted bland. I hear they have good seafood on certain nights but unfortunately we didn't see any the night that we went. The rest of the food at the buffet wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Disgusting!  This has got to be the WORST food experience I have had in the Charlotte area EVER.  When I went to the hibachi grilling area it was explained to me like I was to take the raw food back to my table as is, and eat it.  I pointed out that the sign said \"watch grill & enjoy\" so eventually they did.  But it took a lot of talking to get them to do that.  The rest of the food was out WAY too long before I got to it.  Nothing was fresh.  Nothing was replenished new.  When I finely got back to my table with my 1st plate, the waitress asked me right way if she could remove my plate and throw it away.  I guess I should have let her.  It made me ill all night and I haven't been out of the bathroom since.  They have their clock above the door set 1/2 hr ahead so at 9:45 the staff acted like it was well after 10:20pm, when they were still supposedly still \"open\".  Before closing time they were cleaning the restrooms, mopping the dining room floor and putting up chairs on the tables making me feel very unwelcome walking in before 9pm.  Speaking of which, I couldn't even get into the restrooms w/out slip sliding across the dining room floor only to find a guy was blocking the restroom doorway mopping the ladies room.  They also clearly don't bother to sanitize things like the door handles that have black and red mold on them.  Just look when you go in, you will see it too.  It took many toilets to find one that wasn't splashed with urin even after the cleaner was done.  Gross!  This place should think about keeping the place sanitary at least until they put the closed sign up at 10pm as advertised even with the lit sign and on the restaurant guide.  The only saving grace was the so so saki, but seriously going to Cookout in Dorita, around the corner would have been a WAY more pleasant dining experience then what I endured at this place.  NOTHING was AT ALL like the photo ad they post on their site.  This was COMPLETELY NOT like that at all.  
I hope I don't have to call in sick tomorrow too.  If I do I will be calling the health department next.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Really sucked today. Also a bathroom tells me a lot about a restaurant & I literally almost threw up when I went to the bathroom. This place is disgusting. Staff is not friendly. Go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Have been here for lunch several times.  Great variety of sushi, appetizers, main dishes, sides.  Everything we tried was excellent.  Nice that everything was labeled as to ingredients and if it was spicy.  Only disappointment was waiter did not refill our water glasses.  He did clear away dirty dishes promptly.  The only soups on the buffet were spicy, I asked for WonTon, which was brought to our table in about 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Staying in Charlotte for the weekend was a great experience. It was time to go home and didn't want to leave on an empty stomach. My brother was driving around earlier and said he saw Fuse Buffet off the road and wanted to eat Asian buffet and we all agreed.

From the outside, it looks like an old CVS. We weren't sure what to expect but they were open on 11 am on a Sunday afternoon. We walked in and were surprised at how nice it looked. We were seated on the left hand side of the buffet at the booth area with chairs. 

The buffet setup style reminds me of Golden Coral. There's a hibachi and sushi side to the buffet all the way on the left hand side. I was impress with the many option of shrimp dishes, which all were very flavorful. I was also surprised to see frog legs on the buffet! There was also lobster and fried crabs too. If you want the King Crab, it cost $10 extra per person and it's also all you can eat. Didn't try the hibachi. The sushi was good.

We all enjoyed ourselves. While checking out, the owner asked me how everything was and I told him how great the experience was and loved the many shrimp dishes because I don't see that in Atlanta."}
{"text":"This buffet is just ok. It's only $11 for dinner buffet for sushi, hibachi, and Chinese food. But the last couple of times I have been, the food has been cold and the sushi not fresh. And I've always been during peak dinner hours. I'm not expecting 5 star sushi from a buffet but sushi that's not fresh can make someone really sick. The hibachi is just ok. And they always undercook the veggies. The egg drop soup and the spring rolls are flavorless. And the egg rolls are dripping with oil/grease. The service is mediocre at best. How you fail to be a fantastic server at a buffet is beyond me. It also states on their website that they accept competitions coupons and that is a lie. They did not honor the coupon I brought in."}
{"text":"The music is incredible, the food is great, if a bit salty, the service is sweet. 

The service is the drawback. No recommendations for the new restaurant because they haven't tried it yet. Not sure what's available for beer/wine and gone for 3-4 minutes to get a drink menu. Make no mistake, service will get better, and food is worth the visit. 
So is the music, at least this night. 
Just changed 3 to 4, but will lower it if the service is the same next time.
Did I mention the music? The live talent was amazing this night too."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my family one day and I thought it was fantastic.  I am surprised at reading some of the poor reviews on this place.  I think the lunch buffet was 9.99.  From what I could tell it is likely to be similar to the dinner buffet that costs twice as much, but it is a good deal for 10 bucks for lunch.  I liked the sushi (thought it was good quality), the hibachi was pretty good as well.  I really liked their dumplings and teriyaki chicken sticks.  I thought everything was very good actually, as did the rest of my family.  The desserts weren't that great but you don't go to Chinese buffets for desserts.  

Also, I found the staff VERY pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Great for a fun night with grown people.  Haven't had dinner there yet but looks good."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Lots of different types of sushi and it is all good...this is not your typical buffet of sushi.  

I am not even going to waste time on a review here.....great food, good price and clean place (although sanitation score is 92.5 i believe...."}
{"text":"I've been living in Charlotte for 5 years now and the only relatively good buffet we'll have is Tin-Tin's (Can someone tell me why Greensboro has way better buffets than us?)

Anyways, the buffet size isn't gigantic although the interior of the restaurant is rather nice. They do have a huge amount of sushi to offer (which I love and was so ecstatic to see!) Other than sushi, they really need to step on their quality of food. Sure, it isn't disgusting but the crab legs seem old, their soups are too too hot (we had someone burn their hand badly from picking up their bowl).

The one thing that I could notice easily was the tom-yum soup. If you get tom-yum at a restaurant, you'll see how orangey red it is all around. However, with this, they used an instant tom-yum flavor (the ones you can buy in jars at the Asian supermarket). The red was floating in little dots in cloudy water with no flavor, similar to bad ramen.

I'll be back in a few months and we'll see how much it improves."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE buffets and have been on the search for a favorite spot in Charlotte since moving here.  We had passed by Fuse accidentally one day and made a mental note to come back and try it.

For $10.99 for a buffet dinner on a weekday, you just can't beat that price.  The place has a decent selection of Asian favorites including sushi rolls, your typical American Chinese dishes and desserts.  I'm allergic to shellfish and the chef was kind enough to make a salmon roll just for me, since most of the rolls had crab or shrimp in them.  That was a nice touch.

I have a weird habit of eating my dessert and then eating soup last.  When the waitress saw me eating dessert, she naturally thought we were finished and gave us our check.  Then she saw me eating soup and came back and apologized profusely for bringing our check too soon.  It was no big deal at all, but I appreciated how polite their service was.

Overall the food is OK, but the restaurant is nice and clean and not crowded so I'd definitely go back if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere and staff were great. The music was a great addition but a little loud for dinner if you're trying to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Quite the popular asian buffet in the university area. If you can recall the location for the old Ham's, this place moved in a little while ago. Although I haven't tried it until recently, I'm glad I did. 

I tend to be a Showmars usual in this area, but if I'm feeling a little frisky, I may just wander on over across the road for a more lavish meal, or Asian comfort food. The buffet here is awesome! From Hibachi, to sushi, to chicken, beef, fish, octopus, etc. You name it. It literally wraps around itself, it's so large.

Lunch specials during the week- only 7.95. On weekends, I've heard they offer their standard buffet plus unlimited crab legs for 22.95. I have yet to try them out. 

Staff is friendly, only little interaction with them if you chose the buffet. They keep up with your drink refills without issue.

Overall, great Asian buffet!"}
{"text":"This place is overall satisfactory.  The food was delicious, there was a variety of sushi, unlike at most buffets, and the wait staff was friendly.  My only complaints are that the fried jalapenos and fried crab legs were completely cold and that our waitress was hovering around our table waiting to take out plates and only refilling our drinks once during our two-hour lunch."}
{"text":"I only hesitate giving them 5 stars because I have only been there twice. Everything I've had there has been fresh tasting and delicious.

The Sushi looked and tasted great, as did the Sashimi. Selection was good, but they don't keep a large supply of each item out - which to me is not a bad thing, as I feel it keeps it fresher that way.

Another thing I liked was that there was actually space between tables, so you can walk around without feeling that you are bothering anyone. I did not feel cramped

One person complained about something they smelled - but I've had no such experience so far, and I have walked out of restaurants that smelled like a dumpster in the past. I'm not shy about it either."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to go out for a nice dinner and decided to try Fuse since neither of us had ever been there. We checked out the website and although the price was a bit steep for a buffet, at $19.95, the pictures looked delicious and we figured it was worth a shot. 

Upon walking in, we had a bit stand-offish customer service but we were seated right away in a nice clean and quiet booth in a lovely restaurant. My first stop after ordering our drinks was the restroom. I wish the offensive lingering smell would have warned me of things to come. My first red-flag was the obvious cigarette burns on the toilet paper holder but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and 
headed back out.

We then had a look around at the buffet and things seemed okay, so we decided to try it, despite our hesitation over the 91.5 food score rating. First stop was the noodle bar, which served a soupy noodle dish that was bland at best. Our second trip to the buffet included a plate of sushi, most of which was EXTREMELY over-stuffed with cream cheese. The sashimi was very dried out and chewy. 

Round three we moved onto the hot food. The duck, which had been the reason we were most excited to try the hot food, was all fat and bones. The sesame chicken was gristle and breading. I was especially excited to try the baked scallops and cheese, but once again, the ENTIRE scallop shell was FILLED with cream cheese to a nauseating level. 

At this point we had had enough, so we called the owner to explain our disappointment. He actually agreed that the food was not good saying \"yes we have to Americanize it\"  and expressed that my British boyfriend wasn't used to the Americanized food and that  \"Americans like cream cheese\" The owner then stated \" I tell the chef to buy better duck, but he won't\" 

One would think that as the owner, who is listening to customer complaints, would be able to make those kinds of decisions!

He offered to cook us more bad food, which we refused, obviously, and we requested he discount the meal, which he completely refused saying things like, \"it's a buffet, you understand.\"

I recommend you do not go anywhere NEAR this restaurant. They will take your money off you without any sympathy and leave you with at best a bad memory and a seriously upset stomach."}
{"text":"Best of the current crop of AYCE Chinese buffets in the University area. The interior is very nice is a understated manner; well at least as opposed to the much flashier China Buffet that is down the street.
This buffet is primarily for  the seafood and sushi fan. When it first opened the selection of sushi for lunch was great! There were rolls that I could actually identify instead of the usual mystery fish missmash. At least half of the rolls didn't have surimi; hurray! They had white tuna which I love. There was a section which had little dishes of various Japanese pickles; they were awesome! Sadly they have scaled the variety of fish options back, and no more Japanese pickles. 

The weekend lunch is a few dollars more and has more seafood and sushi options.
 
The rest of the buffet is not extensive as some of the other area buffets. However they 
use big platters on the buffet instead of the large vats and only put out smaller amounts which are frequently replenished. Try the short ribs, slightly chewy and delicious.

Desert is nothing special, cakes and a few fresh fruits. Also canned kumquats and loquats which are surprisingly bland. A freezer with small containers of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice creams. Maybe not the ice cream variety of other places, but that's a good thing. Some buffets strike me as giant norovirus platforms, but I did not get that impression here. 

Pretty good for a buffet if you like Sushi; check it out!"}
{"text":"LOL @ Pourina's review. :)

For a buffet, this place is fantastic! Aside from maybe a one or two sushi restaurants in Atlanta, I can write this one down as one of my favorites. There was a HUGE variety, but there were only a couple rolls of each, which kept everything more fresh. Rolls were all down one side, while sashimi and other sushi-related items were on another (seaweed salad, crab salad, 3-5 different roe, etc). I stuck mainly to the sushi, all of which looked and tasted like it doesn't even belong in a typical buffet, though I stayed away from any that already had sauce on top, as it makes the rice a bit soggy.

Aside from that, there was plenty of typical Asian buffet fare. Pretty much all of their seafood selection was yummy, especially the baked scallops. The boys definitely made the $20 dinner price tag worth it by chowing down on almost NOTHING but plates upon plates of snow crab legs. I'm pretty sure they were onto us after a while, because the kitchen gradually started salting the crab legs like CRAZY to the point where you can see the salt caked on it and rendered them completely inedible. The boys chilled out for a while with that and moved on to the crawfish lol. The crawfish was flavorful, though on the salty side in my opinion. Fast forward about half an hour and the boys are bringing back more plates of crab legs to feast on. Haha.

There was a tiny hibachi section, which no one in my party went for. The dessert section was also pretty small, with a few different types of fruit, jello, mini cakes, banana pudding (which was AWESOME), and ice cream cups.

We came in at 5:30 and didn't leave until 8 or 9 lol. I'm pretty sure even the waitresses hated us after a while because they became a lot slower at giving us drink refills and clearing away our dirty dishes.

FYI - saw they had a health rating of 90+, which is always a plus, especially for a buffet."}
{"text":"Frozen fish.

They ran out of salmon and tuna very quickly so I asked for more.  They brought out fish still crunchy with ice in the center of it.

I could write more about how the lobster concoction reeks of trimethylamine (window cleaner) and cheap/old fish.

I won't say more because frozen sushi is not acceptable and if you go here i hope you like crab because you will be overpaying for a buffet with a very poor showing when it comes to non-crab seafood."}
{"text":"is this place still open? Tried to go on a Tuesday and all the lights were off and doors locked."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly but most of the hot foods were over cooked! Sushi was good and the customized soup was good. The overall cleanliness of the restaurant was not so good but giving that we were there late at night they might had not been able to keep up cleaning up! The women bathroom was very dirty!"}
{"text":"If you want to be ignored, service with a frown, dirty tables, and  and overall filthy restaurant, eat here!!  OMG!!  They replenish the sushi bar with fresh sushi on dirty plates.  I really wish I was exaggerating. This place is a total disaster. I don't how it's gotten okay reviews.  Don't eat here."}
{"text":"I don't understand how people are giving this place great ratings. The food is regular buffett food. For the price, I expected much higher quality food.  You are better off saving your money and going to PF Changs! If this place was priced reasonably I would be able to give a better rating.  Ive eaten at many buffets that have the same quality food at a cheaper rate.  The hibachi grill was even mediocre.  Do not make the mistake of wasting your money here."}
{"text":"How my friends and I stumbled upon this place was a spontaneous, unanimous decision. Even stuffed in 2 cars, we saw  \"Fuse\" dazzling on that street corner and forgot where we planned on going in the first place, but it no longer mattered. 

I might be hyping this place up way more than I should, but it's seriously the best \"Chinese\" buffet I've ever been to. The variety of sushi that they provided was much more elaborate than the few normal rolls found in buffets around the Raleigh area. They also have a Mongolian grill section. Although this place is smaller than other Chinese buffets, the quality is actually comparatively better. 

Eh, basically, if you're thinking about some Chinese buffet, and you're in Charlotte, go here!"}
{"text":"If was a random place to pick but the sushi was great but the hibachi was very plain. Needing flavor there. Also the outside made us kinda reconsider going in there but hey \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" If the hibachi improves I might consider going there again."}
{"text":"Fav spot close to home and the escovich tacos are to die for!! Great atmosphere but on the pricey side..."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous! The maki / sushi section of the buffet is where I've spent most of my time on the 3 trips to Fuse I've made since moving to Charlotte. The rolls are very good (won't go as far as saying 'GREAT' or 'AMAZING', but better than many places I've been) and the variety and selection is what I like the most. Rather than ordering 3 or 4 rolls between two people and mixing them up that way, at Fuse you can have one or two pieces of a dozen different types of maki while you're there. For me at least, this is the best part about this restaurant. Other buffets I've been to that feature sushi usually have a small selection to pick from, but Fuse gives you many choices.

The other food I've sampled from the buffet is good too, though I will comment that I tried the egg drop soup on my last visit and it was too thick (almost like a gel) for my taste... then again, it's been a while since I've had egg drop soup from anywhere else, I just seem to remember it being more of a liquid and less of a gel.

The staff at Fuse has always been very friendly and attentive enough (clearing plates, offering refills on drinks, etc.) without being overbearing.
And the price for the buffet for lunch OR dinner is great, two people can go for dinner with hot tea (good) on a Friday night for just under $30 (before tip)

I do have to space out my visits to Fuse (even though you get a free meal after 6 dinners or lunches) because the 'all you can eat' sushi might wear down the awesomeness of it. I never thought there could be such thing as \"too much sushi\", but 3 plates full may be proof that there is. :-)"}
{"text":"As far as Chinese Buffets go, I was honestly surprised with how bad every single item here was. There wasn't a single saving grace dish, which is basically impossible for any restaurant. Highly highly do NOT recommend. Lotus Buffet is right down the street, much better food across the board, and less expensive."}
{"text":"I never really have high expectations for Chinese buffets. I find that I never like any of the food. Fuse is no exception. There isn't a wide variety of sushi choices, and whatever I ate didn't seem very fresh either. Hibachi steak and shrimp was dry. However, I do like the system they have for the grill. Take a clothespin with a number to put on your plate. Just make sure you remember your number and don't take someone else's food. The only hot food item I did like was the buttered fried shrimp. It was the one with the most taste out of my entire meal.

Two new things I did see here that aren't at other buffets: make your own noodle soup and individually packaged ice cream cups. I'm indifferent to the soup, but the ice cream cups were a minus for me. There's only the 3 stock flavors of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. No toppings. I normally look forward to the variety of choices and toppings at Chinese buffets to make up for the not-so-great food."}
{"text":"It was great place for large groups. Had something for everyone, even the vegetarians. Since it was a buffet, the quality was not the best, but I would definitely go back with a group."}
{"text":"Overall wonderful experience. 

The owner Farley Flex came by and paid our table a visit. Staff are very friendly, helpful and service was quick given we were a table of 12. 

The restaurant has a very relaxed/soulful vibe; beautiful artwork on the walls and live entertainment every weekend starting in June (I will be going back for that).

No complaints!"}
{"text":"Stay away from here! Go to Bento's, near Harris Teeter store on Hwy 49, if you need assistance getting items from the buffet and don't want to spend so much money.

The food is good, the service is poor, the management won't allow staff to assist handicap customers get things from the buffet. They were not that busy and they told us they can't assist at the high price of the buffet you'd think they would offer assistance. The restrooms have a major sewage issue so much you small it in the dining room (the 2 times I went 2 months apart it reaked) it even smelledin the parking lot. If you did not go in the restrooms you would not have noticed and just wrote the \"ordor\" off as some chinese food smell, but once you know the source its horrible. The restaurant did not seem to be worried or sorry for the smell.

I had a friend, handicapped, go to a Taco Bell they carried the food to the car, opened the doors what service from a fast food restaurant isn't found here."}
{"text":"Nice, clean buffet with lots of variety.  Been here a few times and will most likely return."}
{"text":"Everyone is complaining how bad the sushi section is but forgetting at the same time its a buffet..Ur Paying like $10 a person so how fresh or exotic are u expecting the sushi to be...everyone's entitled to their own opinion but u can't expect supreme greatness for $10, 11 dollars..."}
{"text":"This place was supposed to be the new best sushi place in the area. Lets just say I have no idea why so many great reviews have been written. I got out of the car and the smell of rotten fish overwhelmed the parking lot. We got inside and at first it looked great but when we sat down to get our drinks the waitress was super short and snappy. They don't have any liquor, only beer, short wine list, and hot saki (not even cold.) Their buffet food was not worth 21.50 either. I am a sushi fanatic, not to be confused with a sushi snob tho - I have had grocery store sushi better than what they offer here. The avocado was not ripe at all and the rice wasn't cooked right. Needless to say it was quite the chew. They did have a wide variety of other things on the buffet but none of which were very good. The lo mien was GROSS, the broccoli was completely overcooked, and the egg roll tasted like strawberry yogurt. The only decent thing I got was the sesame chicken. My guest felt the same way, and at the end of the meal decided he would try the banana pudding, thinking how on earth could anyone mess up banana pudding - well Fuse can. So anyway, we ended up with a fifty six dollar tab (before tip) for two buffet plates and one bottle of terrible saki. I have eaten at Enzo (downtown, top notch, best sushi in Charlotte) and paid about 72 for the same thing. Needless to say, don't waste your time here. It may have a great location, but I promise the drive elsewhere is worth the quality of the food your good eat. Sorry Fuse! Figure it out."}
{"text":"Food: Not great, not terrible. But don't forget that this is a buffet so you're not going to get a 5 star meal. Typical chinese-american dishes. My top fave was definitely the butter shrimp. Reminds me of the butter shrimp at Tin Tin. Pretty good. The sushi was good, not too bad for the price you pay. I love that they have the seaweed salad on the bar for you. The major downfall was the ice cream. They come in little cups(vanilla, chocolate, & strawberry). That pretty much sucked. 

Service: Seriously need to go back to training. They were quick to clear our table & refill our drinks. But hollering across the restaurant to another server over your customers' heads is beyond rude. Mommy & daddy never taught you any manners? For that reason, I had to knock off 2 stars. 

Exterior needs a little touch up. For a fairly new restaurant, they could at least fix it up a bit more.

Now, there aren't too many decent buffets in Charlotte. So Fuse may be the best one to go to instead of driving all the way to Pineville. But with these servers lacking manners, I don't think I'll be revisiting. But if having these girls yelling over your head doesn't grind your gears, be my guest and try them out."}
{"text":"One of my worst experiences ever.  Food was OK.  Not great, not bad.  Very stereotypical of the type of restaurant.  My problem lies with the staff.  No one we tried to speak to spoke English.  We just got a lot of head nodding no matter what we asked.  There was a table of loud twenty-somethings.  They were so loud people on the other side of the restaurant could hear them, kept looking their way and shaking their heads.  This is a large establishment.  No one came over and asked them to quiet down.  They were so loud (I was about 3 tables away) I could not hear what my dinner partner was saying.  I got up, went to the hostess (whose English was better than anyone else's) and asked to see the manager.  All I received was a blank stare.  I asked three times.  Nothing.  I sat back down, and the rude table only got louder.  I finally got up and went over to the table myself.  This only made them even more rude.  I went back up to the buffet to get some food, turned around and the leader of the bunch was literally in my face telling me I'm a bitch and if I touch him he will call the police.  I backed up, (remember, he invaded my space) and started yelling, hoping management would now come out.  STILL NOTHING!  I won't eat where management does not have a backbone if a customer is being threatened.  I'm a very small woman.  I'm the only one who stood up against these people.  There were large men in the restaurant.  No one.  People thanked me.  No one helped.  Where was management?"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while visiting family.

- Food: Well, it IS a buffet. Sushi selection was terrible and everything was obviously not fresh. Hibachi steak was dry. My ice cream had freezer burn.
+ Price: Cheap for a buffet
+ Atmosphere: Typical Chinese buffet layout. Good for groups.
- Service: Unprofessional. Waiters yelling across the room is not very pleasant.
- Recommendation: Nope."}
{"text":"I was on my way to China Buffet and saw Fuse so I decided to stop here for dinner. 



Price:
 Dinner buffet $12.94 without Snow crab. Add 8 dollar more w/Snow crab. Definitely get more from Seattle for this price.

Decor:
I like the decor. Warm and cozy but for Tuesday night this place is half empty. 

Food:
The food was good and the selection was decent. However, some of the food definitely was out for a while, but this is a problem that plagues many buffets.  
Avoid the Tom Yum soup, Ha Kao and Siu Mai but definitely go for the sushi. There is no Sashimi.  Some of my other favorites were the chicken wings, the Hibachi and the crunchy sushi rolls. 

Service:
When it came to cleaning up plates and water refill, the service was spot on. Waitress was polite and friendly."}
{"text":"We come to the University Area once a week due to my wife's classes at Charlotte Music School; unfortunately, I don't get to go to Fuse Buffet each time due to my waistline.  This is my second visit (which is a good thing) since there aren't many sushi buffets around town, and I do crave my sushi.  We have come an hour or two before it closes on Tuesdays, so it's never crowded, but I always feel like we don't get the best pieces of food at the end of the day, whether they've been sitting out or they don't want to put out fresher things despite kitchen closing at 9:30pm.

However, I do like the options for the price of the 10.95 dinner.  They have a decent amount of sushi options (no sashimi), mongolian grill style, as well as the typical fare of  soups, honey chicken, spare ribs, wings, and the like.  I wish there were bigger pieces of fish in their sushi rolls, but I can't complain for the price.  Also, the desserts are standard but a little lacking.  Plus, no frozen yogurt at the end, only the unappetizing ice cream in a small cup with those little wood tongue depressor spoons.  There's probably better Chinese buffets out there, but this one has decent sushi that are more complex than basic rolls."}
{"text":"Fuse buffet was a super fail from beginning to end. When we walked in they had taped up a sign saying that they had increased their prices. Um...ok we're already here so let's keep going. We were seated immediately and the food looked awesome. There seemed to be many different options and a lot of variety with the sushi and chinese and hibachi. The sushi variety was pretty good, very decent for a buffet style restaurant but the chinese was nothing special and the hibachi literally took a half an hour to get shrimp and vegetables. Dessert was basically nonexistent since all they had was a freezer filled with cups of ice cream with ice cream leaking out of the top. There was nothing that looked sanitary about that situation at all. To add insult to injury we asked them to split the check and they swiped my friend's card for the full amount and each of our cards for half too. He ended up paying almost $50 for his dinner! They didn't even inform us that they had made the mistake. I guess she just threw the double charged receipt away and hoped he wouldn't notice! For mediocre food, I'd rather go to a place with honest employees."}
{"text":"Wow what a Buffet, excellent choice and variety of Sushi
as well as every other Asian dish you could want. I have already been 4 times, 
M-F lunch price is $9.95 how can you go wrong"}
{"text":"Decent quality sushi for the price and amount. Keep in mind it's all you can eat, so your not going to get the \"best\" quality. It's good for a quick sushi fix, but that's about it. I ate here for lunch 2 times, and the food itself isn't that great. It's Luke warm and not fresh. I would like to assume that dinner is different, but I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Went here on a business lunch. and this place was just ok for me.  I am a fan of Buffets of all types, but this one is a \"little\" too fancy for me.  They did have a large selection.  And the food was good for the most part.  The Hibatchi station is a little on the small side, and it's too bad that the cooks face away from you while cooking because I enjoy watching.  The number system is a must since you don't have the interaction with the chiefs like some other joints.  

If I have one bad thing to say it is that in an attempt to be more upscale a lot of the hot meat is placed on plates instead of in buffet servers.  While this looks nice, if the food is not eaten quickly you tend to have cold meat at the end of the plate."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night, including our table there are only 2-3 other tables.  Variety is decent, a lot of different cut rolls, but half of them are some sort of variation with cream cheese. Many items from the photograph were no where to be found.  It has potential, but due to lack of customer, foods are dry, not fresh and salty."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place shortly after moving here, and it's become a semi-regular place to dine for dare nights, going out with friends, etc. 
The sushi is always fresh, and with a wider selection than I've seen in a lot of sushi buffets previous. My only complaint is that the hibachi grill ends up tasting pretty bland."}
{"text":"Finally! This is the buffet that we deserve in the university. My wife and I have been waiting for this place to open and it was well worth every nail-biting moment. 

As we have been to the same building in several of it's earlier incarnations (same decor, different name) we were pleasantly surprised by the new look coming in. Very classy, very Asian, but not overdone like many Chinese buffets, like they are try to convince you beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are in a Chinese place.

Its new still so it was fairly slow. We were brought to a table a put in our drink order. Then it was buffet time!

 How do you say awesome in Chinese? I really don't care but that's what it was. The layout is not overcrowded with Americanized versions of Asian foods. Its laid out in smaller portions on white plates so that it gets changed over frequently and it is REALLY, REALLY GOOD!!!

Sushi was a delight. Also super fresh and done in small batches so as to be as fresh as possible. The salmon was crazy fatty, the dragon roll was spicy ( though not spicy enough for my particular sickness ) and tasty. Everything was just a dang treat! They also keep caviar in small bowls as well as seaweed salad, seared tuna, and tons of other tasty treats. Your $16.95 dinner tab also includes crab legs, ginger lobster, salt and pepper shrimp, etc, etc.

How bout this........... GO! Seriously, have I ever steered you wrong? No, no I haven't. So go, and then thank me by showering me with gifts and praise and stuff. You won't regret it!

Eat well, muchacho's!

V-Dub!

NOTE: I just checked the website. The $16.95 price tag is a grand opening special and is in place for a limited time. The regular price for this buffet will be $20.95.  I will also note that for the quality and variety you get , it is still very reasonable. We will go again, even at that price!"}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese buffets in the Charlotte area, this one has a pretty decent selection of sushi items and the remaining hot bar items were tasty and varied. Yep, even a few things that have nothing to do with Chinese food like mac & cheese.

My only complaint is that the times posted on the glass above the sushi were never updated. We were here at close to 2:30 but the times were all marked \"10:58\" and we did see several items refreshed.

The map pin might be in the wrong place. They're located at the corner of North Tryon and McCullogh, south of WT Harris."}
{"text":"Went to this new buffet Saturday. Really great sushi. The selection was amazing for a buffet. Really fresh. As noted in the other review they put out small portions of everything and put out fresh all the time. 

The hot items were also refreshed often in the same way. Some of the usual \"buffet\" things but some unusual and creative things as well. Wish they had Hot and Sour soup though.

Service was great. Price is still $16.95 at dinner.  A bargain considering the high quality. nice atmosphere.  A big place.

No beer though!  Bummer.  They are so new that they may be waiting for their license to come through. Should have asked.

Easy to miss this place when driving down Tryon.  Thier sign is creative but hard to notice amongst all the other visual clutter in the area.

All in all a winner."}
{"text":"Came by today at 12:15 and they were closed . Not sure if this place has since 
Closed their door for good  as no sign was left but  the hours on the door said 11am for Sunday .. Hmmm  mystery . Please update business status ."}
{"text":"I  am the cold chill creeping up your legs. I am the monster hiding under the bed. I am  the bullfrog devouring anything I can wrap my mouth around. I am the copperhead lying in wait. I am the lion, and you are my pawn. I am the wormhole sucking up any unsuspecting mass floating aimlessly in my wake.

What is this abomination wandering among the living?

I am every buffet's worst nightmare. I am the hippo that will devour everything in site. I am the killer of crab legs and crawfish. 

I am that guy. I am that customer who will commit the gluttonous 3 hour sin. Shrimp Shu Mai beware - I will eat you. 

Luckily for fuse, the crab legs were a little stale and obviously frozen for quite awhile. Do we have a new king of all things Asian buffets? Not quite, but definitely deserving of honorable mention."}
{"text":"For the area, it's definitely the best Chinese buffet I could fine; however, if one is willing to travel a little farther, the buffet off of independence will really blow you away.  

That's not to say this place doesn't have a great selection. You find food raging from sushi, just official Cantonese, and everything in between. You probably will find a few American dishes like ribs or meatloaf also located on the buffet. And the price definitely doesn't hurt this place, because of its affordability, I probably will return."}
