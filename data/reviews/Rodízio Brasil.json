{"text":"Okay experience. Meat was not impressive, mostly too dry and overcooked. Over priced for what they have to offer. Spent $100 for two. You can find much better restaurants around the area."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner. Salad bar could use a little upgrade though, let's be honest, you're there for the meat.  Hot, succulent and plentiful. Great assortment.  Favourite of the night: pork!"}
{"text":"Great meat and average side salads. I don't give 5 stars since the Brazilian black beans where not that great. It looks like they opened a can and dumped them on the pot. The atmosphere was good and service was excellent. I found it also a bit pricey and there is not the option of 1/2 rodizio as it is mentioned by another comment. Comparing with the big Restaurant \"La Milsa\" this one has better meat quality but lower quality in the salad bar."}
{"text":"Really liked this place -- good meat. Service was also pretty good as much as one can imagine when it comes to a Brazilian all you can eat place..."}
{"text":"I would not go back. The meat was either raw on the inside, as I had asked for rare, or it was dry and over cooked. Salad bar was fine, most things tasted and looked fresh. I have been to many churrascarias but this would have to be the worst."}
{"text":"They must be having a hard time keeping customers as there is a room reserved for Groupon / Tuango and the like where they add a couple of salads to justify their claim of $90.00 worth of food for $39.00... These type of ripoff techniques seems to be encouraged by Tuango ... Service was good and the Brazilian hostess very pleasant but food was kind of bland as their limited cuts of meat are grilled on an electric grill. So don't expect a Charcoal / BBQ flavor as a Brazilian churrasco must have !!! The typical Brazilian feijão was pretty much just boiled beans with very little \"tempero\" (spices/flavor) and the rice tasted as it had been reheated a few times... Drinks are overpriced with a watered down caipirinha or a Corona going for $9.00 and a glass of a carton packed white house wine goes for $10.00 and a glass of Portuguese bottled wine for $15.00. What was good ? The $10.00 trio of fried yucca / polenta / bananas was OK ... So there isn't yet a good Brazilian churrascaria in Montreal ..."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited for this place.   I never had a chance to go to Copa Cabana in TO and thus place was similar to it.   Place smelled pretty go from the outside.   When we got in,  it was a pretty full house.     A little disappointed in the salad bar.   Not much selection and things liked pretty messy.   The meat came out pretty slow and not as frequent as I wanted it to.   We were also seated in a corner which didn't ready help.   Only good thing is,  the waiter got used to us asking for multiple servings after a couple of visit to our table.   Lol.  He than came more frequent.  I guess after trying this here in Montreal, I don't think I would be trying the one in TO.  Friends said not much of a difference.   This type of restaurant is good if you have never tried it before.   But,  not ready worth going again.     Price came out to be almost $40 a person."}
{"text":"Brazilian meat culture is defined by picanha and if that's what you're after, don't even bother. Lowest quality of the cut I've ever tried at a rodízio. Overall very disappointing. On the other hand, servers were great and very friendly."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The salad bar was non-existent, and whatever  they had there was already  getting old and stale. The waitress took forever to refill our drinks even though her station was right next to us. The person who was supposed to be diligent  with serving our meat was ridiculous.  He didnt understand our requests in any of the four languages that the venue was supposed  to speak in; Spanish , Portuguese,  English  or French. The meat was ok but the portions were small and the guy rarely came to our table. For a $200 bill I expected  more."}
{"text":"Nota 10 em geral. O restaurante e chiquerrimo! A picanha divina, polenta frita, tudo perfeito com exceção do tempero do feijao que não e igual o de minas. O rodízio e muito bom, carne a vontade ate cansar e caipirinha uma delicia!  Sou apaixonado e ja e a quinta vez que vou lá. Esse restaurante foi uma benção pra Montreal que não tinha nada que prestava para matar a saudade de IM verdadeiro rodízio brasileiro."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 friends as we have a similarly themed restaurant in the UK. SO DISAPPOINTING! The meat was super salty, fatty and full of gristle. The waitress was extremely forceful and rude and didn't appear to listen to us. A friend asked for the dessert menu 3 times before finally being given it. To round things off, the bill included a hefty service tip, which we reluctanctly paid as the food and service was quite frankly diabolical. Overpriced and way below average. I recommend you avoid it and go to one of the many other restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant in Old Montreal. The explanations were well done. The small salad bar was quite nice with some Brazilian specialties on the side that were extremely tasty. The meat started coming by. I don't know about others, but there was plenty of meat and they certainly didn't limit us in any way. Pork ribs, sausages, skirt steak, lamb, roast beef, chicken all came around with no extra prompting. The service was nice and friendly from the French woman serving us, the man coming around with the meat was friendly and hospitable as well. We were a bit put off by the woman in the background who kept after the waitress and server but didn't actually seem to do anything to actually help them, it made us a bit uncomfortable to watch someone treat others in this way.   Honestly, the Brazilian stew was the highlight here and just tasty. With the meat, try not to be the first served or you get the well-done or over-done piece on the outside. But we certainly didn't feel like they were holding back on us at all. We actually had to turn over the coaster to tell them we had enough."}
{"text":"What a bad experience !!! We reserved a table for 8 people to have a nice lunch and watch the World Cup soccer match on July 4th. The game and the animation there was great, but the food..... Horrible!!! Buffet was poor and cold. The meat was either raw or over cooked and tasted liked old meat. Not a lot of option either. For a place that charges $39 for the buffet ( before taxes) they should have a decency to have excellent food to serve. I do not recommend at all, find other places around there with better food. I wish I had read the reviews before going there. We left hungry and upset."}
{"text":"Ooooohhhhh.... authentic Brazilian steakhouse in the heart of Montreal! We chose it randomly, and we were rewarded with a table next to the window. All-you-can-eat steak, includes 15 different types of meat served at the table. Unlimited refills of beans and rice and unlimited is it's to the salad bar. I wasn't crazy about the wine but this didn't ruin my meal. Good meat - enough said!!"}
{"text":"Chicken taste nothing just like in a 3 star Hôtel in cuba.... french fried were cold and the price is a little  too High, not the better option in old montreal, keep looking !"}
{"text":"We went on a slow night, visiting from out of town. The caipirinha was strong but delicious. The buffet portion was good but the meat is where they shined. The chicken and steak were delicious. My daughter never liked steak before this place! The service was quick and friendly. Would strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Too expensive for a poor service. They charge the tips automatically without the client's consent regarding the percentage. Soft drinks are from fountains and yet they do not refill (so expensive for a cup of Pepsi). They closed the kitchen without telling us in advance."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends visiting from Toronto. There wasn't any lineups, which was convenient. We did make reservations ahead of time, but Was the second group of people to arrive there. We had 5 people. The place has a patio and even an indoor patio on the second floor. But the second floor patio is more covered.  The place is not huge, but is quite cozy. My friends and I were whisked upstairs. The decor is nice,you get a neat sense of some cultural aspects here and there.    The food, however, was very disappointing. The meat was dry and extremely salty. I was tasting salt more than the meat! I've been to Brazilian steakhouses in Toronto and also walked in with an expectation of them offering more variety in terms of well done to rare scale. Expectation not met. My favourite was probably the pineapples. As for the salad bar, it was very small. If I did need to make a comment. It would be to check the ingredients. It's not fresh. But I'm not there for salad. So I didn't have much.  Service wise, I thought our waitress in the beginning was nice. The guys serving the food were nice. They didn't really explain the meats unless we asked.. And when we inquired of the dessert menu, the second waitress was very rude. Maybe she had a bad day. But not professional. One visit here was enough."}
{"text":"They make a mean caipirinha and have a twist on the classic with rum: caipirissima. Yum! Can't comment on the food. Visited on a Monday night and no line, but very friendly service and very clean."}
{"text":"When i write a review while im still eating it is because it is either really good or really bad.... this situation is the latter:( Please do yourself a favor and avoid. The food was edible, but only because I knew I would be paying the 30 something already for the rodizio.  My main issue was the salad bar, literally smelling rotten. I was foolish enough to serve myself anyway and regret it big time. Surprise! It tastes as is smells.   Te meat was just ok, nothing special but nothing terrible either.   The best part was probably the service which was very good"}
{"text":"Oh my God was this one of the most disgusting places we've ever been. As soon as we saw how the food was prepared we imagine that we were in dirty friend's kitchen with stuff that has been sitting in the Crock-Pot all day. Will never ever ever go back to this joint and will make sure everyone knows not to as well."}
{"text":"As a brazilian BBQ, it's quite poor. Compared to much better US options such as Texas Do Brazil or Fogo De Chao, it's very bas. However, there are very few choices in MTL for Brazilian BBQ, so based on what is available, it's ok..."}
{"text":"We booked a reservation for this restaurant through AccesResto part of Vie Urbaine. You are supposed to get a discount on the meal when you book through them.  When we got to the restaurant my husband showed the e-mail confirmation from Vie Urbaine to the hostess and she said \"great, no problem!\"  Once we were seated it took about 15-20 minutes before the waiter even acknowledged our presence. My husband once again showed the reservation confirmation to the waiter.    After we ordered we went to what they call a salad bar.  It had some cold macaroni, orange slices, rice, beans, tomatoes and wilted lettuce.  Not impressive at all.  After we got our plates and sat down the waiter said they could not honor our AccesResto discount because we needed to print the e-mail confirmation. What?  It doesn't say anything about printing the voucher on their website. We decided not to make an issue of it and try to enjoy the meal since we had already sat down to eat but it was clearly their way of getting out of honoring the promotion.  I guess they figured because we were tourists they didn't care if we came back or not.    I wish we had read the reviews on this place before we went.  They really don't want serve you any meat.  We were there for quite some time (because the service was so slow).  They would carve little tiny pieces on to your plate when they bothered to come by and act like they were doing you a favor.  It was disappointing.  We've been to several Churrascaria chains like Fogo de Chao, Rafain and Texas de Brazil and this place was horribly disappointing. Unappealing salad bar, stingy carvers and slow service.  I rarely take the time to write bad reviews but I'd like to save some other family from making the same mistake we did so I'm posting to Yelp and TA.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"The food was good, but I think that the staff there does not like Americans. Just as other reviewers said, it's not \"all you can eat\", but rather \"all we will give you\". It felt a bit uncomfortable to have to ask the waiters to give us more meat when they were blatantly trying to avoid giving us food.   This restaurant needs to decide if they are real rodizio or not.   No complaints on the actual food except for the salad bar -- it was pretty bad."}
{"text":"No..NOPE...DON'T Do it! This place was a huge WASTE!!!!  The \"salad bar\" had so many fruit flies all around it. Most of the food on the salad bar had a \"film\" that had formed on it. So we stopped right there...True fear of getting botulism here!  The service was HORRIBLE and we were the only people there.   Ordered off the menu as well and I am not sure what we were actually served...."}
{"text":"I go to this place once every month or two, and im disappointed by the negative reviews about the salad bar. It is à Brazilian steak house, if people want fancy salad they should go elsewhere. The meat is great quality and there are so many options. The restaurant itself is located in a beautiful touristy neighbourhood, and offers a great rooftop terrace during summer. The staff is all Brazilian and they really know their stuff however they are sometimes a little slow."}
{"text":"The Most Authentic Brazilian Food in Montreal. Meat lovers must try!"}
{"text":"I got a sweet deal on Tuango.   I got there on a Saturday night, the atmosphere was relatively lively and it wasn't too busy. The place is quite small for an all you can eat buffet. Their side dishes were plenty (Have a taste at their fried banana.... So yummy!) and the meats are quite good. I personally think this place is better than Milsa and there were a lot of meats choices.   However,  I do need to share that the service can be a little hard to get. When they do serve us, the service was excellent.   This place is a great place and the price is right for a Saturday night. I will recommend for anyone who wants to have a casual Brazilian night with friends or your love ones."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant while walking in Old Montreal, and given the good location we had high hopes. The place itself was nice and cozy, the decor was nice. I liked how they played traditional music. The service was horrendous. First we were served by someone who didn't speak English, which wasn't a problem at all; another waitress was then directed to our table. She was extremely rude, often acting like did not want to serve us, which made us very uncomfortable. Would never come to the table (even though the restaurant was empty). The food was expensive and it did not taste good. We got one of their lunch plates and their barbecue style lunch special. The meal with chicken, fries and salad was not good. The barbecue style plate was also not very well explained and the meats very salty.  Two drinks and two lunch specials came to $60, which was very pricey for the service, quality and taste of food served. Would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"Great waitresses Salty so so meats Terrible salad bar $$$ Warm as hell. No air conditioning No parking"}
{"text":"This bar is the worst attempt at being a Brazilian restaurant I have ever seen. The service was horrendous. I had to flag down our waitress and the server several times. The salad bar was empty and in a huddled corner. The food was unseasoned and often undercooked or overcooked. My wife even got nauseous from the smell. Le milsa is a best choice if you're looking for a better meal.  It is similar to Fodo de Chao or other higher quality rodizios. Save your money and time by avoiding this place at all cost."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Rodizio but definitely needs work. The place is pretty small and people are rubbing shoulders to get around. The meat is not the best quality but the servers work hard to make you feel comfortable.   Not sure if Montreal has other Brazilian steakhouses but this is a decent option."}
{"text":"We visited this new restaurant to celebrate the birthday of a Brazilian friend. The building is gorgeous and the decorations and ambiance are great, they have a lovely courtyard on the second floor.  The food was very good, with a great selection of meat cuts and a decent (not big) salad bar. Personally, I think that the best bang for buck is the HALF-buffet which gives you one trip to the salad bar and 4 cuts of meat, enough for a meal. (If you don't eat pork let them know when ordering and they will bring you alternative meat cuts.) If you want to go all out and haven't eaten in two days, go for the full buffet with all-you-can-eat meat and salad bar. They have a varied à la carte menu too, but for your first visit I suggest you try the meat cuts. They serve a decent caipirinha, not enough cachaça and too much ice for my taste.  The staff is very friendly, though I found that some of them don't speak French and only basic English, so if you aren't familiar with the food or how a churrascaria works you might have to wait until they call on another staff member to explain.  Groups beware: they will add 15% tip to you bill automatically! But they failed to let us know, so many people in our party paid double tip and then the waiters got offended when they asked for some of it back.  Overall a good Brazilian restaurant in an excellent location and a decent price ($15 half and $30 full buffet), try it next time you're in Old Montreal.  http://www.facebook.com/pages/Rod%C3%ADzio-Brasil/256585084451330"}
{"text":"Très belle place, bien situé dans le vieux Montréal. Le concept de viande en service est très appréciable. Cependant, le prix ne se justifie pas dans l'assiette."}
{"text":"Loved it! Good Brazilian food, excellent service and a nice well-located place. Go for the traditional meet rodizio."}
