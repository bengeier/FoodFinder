{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast in the area.  No frills, Mancini toast, reasonable prices (like $4 to $7 per person)  If you are really hungry, try the 3-egg scramble (3 scrambled eggs mixed with grilled onions, peppers, sliced italian sausage, and melted cheddar cheese) - with Mancini toast (and butter). If you finish all of it, you probably won't need to eat again until dinner.  The 2 & 3 egg combos are also good. Sandwiches for lunch are not bad, but breakfast is definitely a better call."}
{"text":"Just stopped in today for lunch. The food was great and service was prompt. They post daily lunch specials, soups, and pies all made from scratch. Their breakfast menu is also very good. This is your classic American Diner fare. I had the Reuben sandwich and a side of stuffing w/ gravy. The Reuben came out nice and hot, slight crisp to the rye bread, and a good amount of corned beef to sauerkraut and dressing ratio. The stuffing and gravy are homemade, I'm guessing from Mancini bread, and had just the right amount of seasonings topped with steaming hot gravy. Definitely worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place. It's convenient for me, only being a few blocks away from my house. Fast service and good breakfast and lunch. Mancini French toast is The Best!!"}
{"text":"Down home spot that is cash only, but a real local's place.  Seems to be family run or at least staffed by people that look like they might be family.  Nothing fancy but solid and quick service!"}
{"text":"Nothing very exciting here.  Decor is very non-descrip.  Waitress could barely crack a smile.  Had an eggs benedict with home fries.  Home fries good.  Eggs & ham good, but the sauce had too much of a sour taste that I scraped it off."}
{"text":"My families favorite breakfast place. It's nice that the same people work everyday so you get to know them. Good is always amazing and really reasonably priced. I always get the Rea's #1 with bacon scrambled eggs and mancinis toast! Best home-fries around. Can't go wrong with this place. It's only open until 2 and closed on Mondays so keep that in mind if you plan to stop by"}
{"text":"This is typical diner fare - or more appropriately, breakfast and lunch fare since they close at 2. But it feels more like a locals only spot with everyone knowing everyone in there, a place to sit and have coffee and linger over your scrambled eggs.... I'm not young by any means but I'm pretty sure we were the youngest people in there - or the only ones that didn't have canes. Just kidding (almost).   Service was prompt and attentive, the food was very reasonably priced, the atmosphere is pretty good, and the food is average. My french toast (made with Mancini's bread as an option!) was very good, the eggs cooked as expected, but the sausage links were not that good. They do offer both links and patties (I like that!) so maybe the sausage patties are better.  I don't hate it and I did enjoy my breakfast, but don't think it's worth going out of your way for. There are plenty of places just like this around the city."}
{"text":"Great small breakfast spot!  Everything is homemade and delicious.  Price is also fantastic!"}
{"text":"Not so good eggs were runny home fries greasy and peppery bacon was all right the best part of the meal was the toast a little expensive for Coraopolis"}
{"text":"What an awful experience. My boyfriend and I are giant fans of breakfast and trying diners. We live in the area and had this place on our list. When we pulled up, we found parking right away, perfect. We went inside and saw there was a nice crowd but managed to grab a table. Once seated a very nice young man came over and set the table....then came our server. She was miserable and rude. She seems annoyed we ordered beverages. Then sets them down promptly and asks what we want. Having never been here we needed a minute with the menu. She seemed annoyed about that. When we were ready to order, she just said \"ready?\" And we proceeded to order. Now, I understand people have bad days, but in service industry, especially in a small place like this, manners go a LONG way!! Never a smile or a thank you or a your welcome from our server at anytime!! After placing our order we did our fair share of people watching and conversing without being glued to our cellphones as we like to enjoy each others company and have some quality time out. We stopped mid sip of coffee as another employee was complaining about something as she passed our table and managed to drop an F bomb in her rant. Now, we're not easily offended people, but...there were children there. Shameless. Once our food came (we both ordered the #2 and a waffle) we didn't see our server for the rest of the meal for a coffee or water refill or even to check to make sure everything was ok. This is a 16 table place with plenty of staff...no reason to not be on top of your tables. The food was pretty good, no complaints there. They even had my favorite dessert, carrot cake. Would have loved to have tried it, but wasn't even able to order it as our server came over and said \"everything ok?, anything else for you?\" As she cleared plates and turned her back and walked away in the same breath...I didn't even have an opportunity to TRY and order a slice. That was the straw for us. The check was then dropped promptly and I went to pay it. We left our server a more then generous 30% tip, even though the service was terrible. We're both in service industry and we were just floored by how we were treated as guests of this establishment.  My boyfriends exact words were simply \"absolutely unbelievable\"...and he's a very patient man. My hope is she less miserable to future guests...because we weren't the only ones she was rude to. We watched as she took orders from tables around us and I was appalled. We are sad to say we won't be returning to our local diner, the service was just that terrible."}
{"text":"A great spot for breakfast! Mancini's french toast is a must. Limited seating so you may have a short wait on the weekend. I don't know how they make their scrambled eggs, but they are awesome."}
{"text":"Went for my first experience this morning. Service was friendly and courteous. Food was really good, fresh, hot and as ordered. I had scrambled eggs and sausage gravy on biscuits. The coffee was great, too. My advice is go early as possible, it's a cute little place but can get busy."}
{"text":"Little family owned breakfast & lunch spot literally across the bridge as you enter Coraopolis from Neville Island. Fast, friendly service with yummy coffee & very inexpensive prices. Lots of locals seem to hang out here.   Food was average breakfast quality. My blueberry pancakes were good, eggs a hair above over easy & apparently they believe in serving crispy bacon. I gave those pieces to my husband - that's how he likes it - a bit too overdone for my liking. My husband enjoyed his Mancini's bread French Toast. He wasn't a huge fan of the sausage links.   All in all a good place for breakfast with outstanding prices & some entertaining locals."}
