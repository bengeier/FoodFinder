{"text":"Excellent fish and chips - both clean and excellent quality. definitely recommend it and I actually very much believe that their fries were home-cut....if they weren't they were damn good..."}
{"text":"We are from arizona and this will be our first stop when the plane lands.  Will see you soon \"king of the fish and chips\". Your friend Joe! 12/23 to 1/2"}
{"text":"We had halibut combo- OMG it was delish.. Best place to find authentic fish n chips.. And to top it all -the friendly people who serve with s smile on their faces.. Loved it"}
{"text":"Food is ok.  The halibut is nothing special.  Their tartar sauce is cheap quality.  They don't take credit card even tho they have a credit card machine. I suspect that they where trying to rip me off since they refused to convert my USD to CAD and changed me 30% extra, changed me for two water bottles when I had one and didn't give back the correct change."}
{"text":"Best Fish & Chips in Woodbridge, there Vegetarian Samosa' are outstanding, orders for take out or dine in extremely friendly family restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this new place out since there have been many fish & chip joints opening up in Vaughan. 

I was quickly greeted by a young gentleman that took my order. I had decided to try the \"Halibut Combo\". 

The fish was of decent size. Roughly six inch square, Fried to golden perfection. The home styled fries are just as you would imagine. They're not bad, but I've never been a fan of this type of French fry.

You have to try the coleslaw. It's a vinegar base versus the creamy kind and I think they nailed the flavour. I wish I had asked for more before I got full from the meal.

Overall, I had a positive experience and would like to try their other offerings.

At the time of this review, it seems that management wants to offer \"shawarma\" as well as your typical fish &  chip menu items. I wonder how the identity of this new fish & chip restaurant will develop with this inclusion."}
{"text":"We are from Phoenix Arizona and as soon as our plane lands next week on Friday, we will be at King of The Fish and Chips. That's all we could think about since last year. Best Fish and Chips around!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing fish and chips!! They are very delicious and tasty and something different to try in the area! The service was great and the people who were working were very friendly and made sure that our order was perfect and enjoyable. If you are a fish and chip lover, you should really check this place out."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish and chips I've had and the service is incredible. The owners are hard working and it's clear they take a lot of pride in their craft.

Fish is crisp and light, the batter is perfect. Fries are standard but good.

Highly recommended for a fish and chip spot in Vaughan."}
{"text":"I always go here for fish n chips. Always have the halibut combo. Fish is always fresh, chips are fresh cut. Just an awesome meal. I am glad they have 2 sizes of combos, because the large is really large. The owners are so nice."}
{"text":"Great place really enjoyed their halibut and chips and yes their fries are home cut-delicious"}
{"text":"The fish was fresh and not oily  (that's the best part)  :-)

Service was good. The server was quite polite and helpful with suggestions. Serving size is decent and tastes good. I had Cod Combo, and it was really cooked nicely.... no smell and not oily. 

One point to note, they only accept cash or debit cards."}
{"text":"Craving fish and chips and this place popped up on yelp. I agree with Jim's review below. The fish and chips were good, not great. The fish was a huge piece, but quite greasy and fries came from from the freezer. Paid 16.99 for halibut and chips. The highlight of this place was the service. Such sweet owners who really wanted to please their customers; that will have people coming back :)"}
{"text":"The food was as-expected. It's a fish and chips place. Service itself was quite nice and friendly.

I've never written a negative review before on Yelp, but this place deserves it.

My problem is their deceptive practice with payment. I ordered and wanted to pay immediately. I had my card out. The lady said pay later.

After we were done with our meal, I went to pay for the meal. The guy said only debit or cash. WHY DIDN'T YOU MENTION THIS WHEN I TRIED TO PAY WITH MY CREDIT CARD RIGHT AFTER I ORDERED? It would have been easy to say we don't take credit cards, right there and then.

I'm from the US, so all I had was my credit cards and US currency. Since I didn't have Canadian currency or a debit card, he said he would take US cash. The total was $37 (CAD). He wanted $35 (USD). Today's exchange rate is 0.768: that is about $28 (USD). On principle, I won't be extorted. You people are crooks!

My coworker had to pay for me, when I had taken him out to treat him to a quick lunch.

By the way... there is an active card machine. I'm pretty sure it would process credit cards just fine.

Shame on you!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a local Fish n' Chips place ever since I moved north, and I have FINALLY found it!!

I got the Halibut combo which came with a massive piece of fish (6oz) and SO many fries. The fish was so flavourful and the batter nice and crispy (I did get take out so it was a little soggy when I got home but this is not the fault of the KING). The fries were just standard fish n chip place fries...the kind that are a little soggy and greasy but taste great doused in malt vinegar.

The inside was clean and the staff was incredibly friendly. While I waited, someone that was dining in finished their meal and remarked that it was one of the best they've had. While I paid for my meal, another person came in and said they were recommended to him as being 'the best'. Hard to believe these weren't paid actors but then once I tried the food...I understood. 
So happy to have found this place...they even had Judge Judy on the big screen which if that isn't a huge plus, I don't know what is! (haha)."}
{"text":"I only go here for Fish and chips. It's soooo good. Not greasy at all. You taste the fish and it's a clean place and freshly cooked. The portions are huge ! This place has re opened they were under renovation. It's opened for business can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"I have only been here once and I already love this place. 
You will never find better customer service. The owners (husband and wife) make a great team. They are both super friendly and helpful. Very patient and accomadating. 
The place also went under some recent renovations. Ive posted the new menu , which reads coming soon. Features a halal menu which they have built a second shawarma style open kitchen for(no cross contamination possible). I also met their wonderful daughter on my way out who was also super sweet.
I ordered a medium poutine and pop ( student special) . They layeres the cheese/gravy in the poutine No stingyness at all! But for some reason I did not like it, which i feel bad for saying but honesty right. The fries could hve cooked a bit lknger for crispy texture and the cheese ddint really hve a a flavour or the gravy. Not even salt, which was weird. But great portion size and super cheap in price.

I also ordered a haddock and fries combo. Comes w 1 HUGE fish and fries. Portion was huge so I couldnt even finish it all. They put it in a box and wrap it w paper before putting it in a paper bag so everything is well secure. Its very tasty and she gave me extra tarter sauce which im grateful for. Other fish n chip places give the bare minimum. I didnt eat the fries until later in the evening warmed them up im my oven. 

Ill definitely be back in Aug when the shawarma station is ready to go. So empressed!!"}
{"text":"Had the large Halibut and Fries meal for lunch with two friends. The fish was flavourful, not over cooked and not overly battered. The portion was large but satisfying. Our service and overall experience was great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always looking for a decent Fish and chip place, I was also eager to try this diner out when I saw the signs up announcing their impending arrival.

We visited the restaurant a few weeks after they opened. Fish and chips were good, not great......the Codfather on Highway 7 is better. Fish was thin and fries not home cut....a bit of a disappointment. Staff were very friendly were eager to ensure you enjoyed your meal.

I will go back as some of their other lunch items looked interesting....."}
{"text":"We were in the area for some work and saw the place. It's a small place which got me intrigued. I love fish and chips and I can say I know what is a good quality fish and chip. This place blew me off! We ordered 2 combos of the haddock fish and chips. It took about 5 to 10 minutes to get our food. It was worth the wait because the food was DELICIOUS!!! Fish was so fresh and crispy that I couldn't stop eating! I was so stuffed but couldn't finish my food. The portion was was really good. I recommend you really need to try this place if you like fish and chips...it's worth the drive and the time. I am definitely coming back again. I'm hooked. Finally found a place which has truly good food."}
{"text":"I had a puncture in my tire and stopped by Active green and Ross for the repair near Islington and HWY 7. I have my car in and went to a restaurant called King of Fish And Chips. I had fish already 3x this week, and was hesitant but had no choice as this was the only restaurant. I had the large Halibut with chips, the Halibut was 10 ounces and had no oil. The tarter sauce was in packets and was so delicious with the fries. It came up to $24.00 including tax for 10 ounce Halibut with fresh cut fries and coleslaw, and water bottle. I thought I was in England, as truly it was the best tasting fish, better than Heritage fish and Chips which I frequent often. The fish is truly fresh, Alaskan Halibut."}
