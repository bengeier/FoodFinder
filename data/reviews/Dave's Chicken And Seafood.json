{"text":"My first visit will be my last.   The girl behind the counter was rude...did not care to answer any questions that i had with specials or what exactly sides i would be getting with a combo deal.  the order took long to make ...(the store was empty not busy)...then when we finally got our chicken and fries.....it was sooo extra greasy than regularly fried foods.  This meant their oil was not heated enough they threw it in cold oil hence the extra grease.  First bite of the chicken was accompanied with a tablespoon of dripping oil...YUCK!  same with the fries.  the fries were not crisp they were limp and over saturated with oil.   waste of my $15
the fries had no taste.  I forgot to mention the counter girl left.  and now the cook lady was on her own handling money, food and the bathroom door button all with no gloves. (THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE WESTDALE MALL LOCATION...WHERE I WENT)"}
{"text":"The serving lady was sooo rude and i cant describe in words. She was unable to answer about sides and combo. Moreover, she wanted to charge for sauces and was not even wiling to give us tissues. Cold stuff and poor service. i recommend all not to go over there seriously. I believe she doesnt want to work.

{"text":"Better than KFC but not close to Popeyes chicken. This place has similar menu as these giants and serve decent fried chicken. the breading need a little bit of work as its not crispy as it should be.

But over all average food for reasonable price. I believe this shop has changed named to Max's Chicken and Seafood but looks like the same food will have to try it under the new Name.

For my Muslim friend they have it write that the chicken is halal."}
{"text":"I hate giving poor ratings to mom and pop type places but I think my chicken was nuked to be reheated!  The chicken was soggy and dry.  I've never had soggy chewy chicken skin/batter before."}
{"text":"Better than KFC and Quik Chick.  Very similar to Popeye's, which is a good thing.  Biscuits just as good and mashed potatoes are okay"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to get and the guy behind the counter said he had the best chicken sandwich in town. So I tried it. Hands down  best I've had in town. Crispy, right amount of mayo, good bun and decent size. Me and a friend got the two sandwich combo and were both very satisfied and full. Fountain drink size can be a little bigger but was still the right amount for washing the food down."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place instead of every other fast food chicken place.  I went for lunch and had a crunchy chicken sandwich.  Was given a choice between mild and spicy so had to have the spice!!  This chicken sandwich was the biggest I've ever had.  The combo came with fries which were good but nothing to write home about.  I would skip next time as the sandwich had two large deep fried chicken breasts on a very large Kaiser bun.  The bread did not overpower given the amount of chicken there was.  I was stuffed afterwards.  And didn't touch the fries or the drink.

The chicken was slightly greasy but almost in a good way.  I continue to recommend.  Can't wait to go back for my second Dave's chicken sandwich.

I had my lunch as take out.  The interior of this restaurant was not large and it was pretty plain and straightforward.  Wouldn't impress anyone but tables and chairs are perfectly satisfactory to eat a good meal on."}
