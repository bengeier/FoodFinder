{"text":"This place is amazing!!! My husband and I come here every time we come to Charlotte! Great flounder and sweet tea!"}
{"text":"OK, it's Showmars.  So all you snobby food Yelpers need to take it easy.  You know what you're getting - the cute little old Greek guy on TV.  But it ain't all that bad.  This location on 7th Street is right next to a bunch of cool shops (Heroes, VisArt, Ho Ho Cherry House, Sunflour Bakery, Philosopher's Stone, etc.)  So make a day of it!  And it's right next to a fun intersection - try not to get hit by a car, it's like playing Frogger.  Yep, you're the frog. Good luck!  Service has always been great here.  They are sooooo nice.  Monday night, kids eat free with a paying adult.  And Jason Frame does magic at your table.  His card tricks are really good.  They also have a good variety of side dishes, unlike other Showmars around Charlotte.  I dig the fried okra.  They also have root beer to drink, which is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Decent service...horrible food. I can't for the life of me understand how this company is so successful. It could only be worse if it was yet another failed Greek attempt at Italian."}
{"text":"Very slow \"servers\". Constantly forgetting things. Anything I have ordered always comes out cold. The bald manager is not a very nice person also. The parking lot is small, barely wide enough to get your care into."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is amazing. I come here on Saturdays with my mother and grandmother and we get a booth in the back. I get 2 eggs scrambled, sausage patties, and hash browns. I love that they give you a slice of cantaloupe with your breakfast, it helps me get my daily fruits in. The servers are great and the food is always ready in a short amount of time."}
{"text":"Today the person taking our order didn't seem like she wanted to answer any questions. I wanted to see how big was the salmon option if you add it to a salad. She came back and said 4oz and held her fingers up in a tiny square. I also asked for lemon wedges abd hotsauce for my fish, and she didn't acknowledge me. Of course when our food came out, nothing I asked for. When I did ask again for it, I got more attitude and eye rolling. Just dropped off another star for that."}
{"text":"Great food real fast. Love their breakfast and their staff is efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Check your receipt!  Placed a takeout order today, and when I went to add a tip, I noticed they had already added one.  When I questioned the cashier she didn't apologize or anything.  Tipping should be up to the customer, not the cashier!!"}
{"text":"Even though this is \"fast food ,\" every meal I've ordered here is fresh and the employees provide wonderful customer service! We get their Greek salads about twice a week!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish fillet sandwich. I've had many things on the menu but the fish fillet sandwich is my favorite. Everybody is friendly and couple of very pretty waitresses all add to the dining experience. Try to avoid lunch hours as this location gets packed very fast."}
{"text":"I often order pick up from this location and sometimes go I. To grab dinner, recently I popped in to eat there with my fianc√© and I was extremely disappointed in the way I was treated by the manager, Maria. She was very rude while I was placing my order because I asked a few questions as I was trying to decide. She also had a very strong accent which made it a little difficult to understand. We sat down and our food came out very shorty. My food was wrong and when I asked for it to be fixed Maria approached my table telling me I ordered the wrong thing because she asked me if I wanted a double stack and apparently that means a burger instead of chicken. I have ordered this same thing probably 12 times and never been asked if I wanted a double stack. I was very uncomfortable that she confronted me about it in such an unprofessional way. Trinity was our server and she was very sweet and did a good job. She did a little to much over sharing about how negative her work environment can be. Overall it was an awful experience and I hope this is a one time fluke!"}
{"text":"The food is very tasty here. The have a very large variety of food. This  restaurant has been newly remodeled. The staff here is very friendly and provides fast service. I have only had lunch here. This is a busy location and sometimes the parking can be a challenge.  There is plenty of seating to handle the large crowds."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have tzatziki, it has \"pita sauce\" When I asked what pita sauce was, one person said it was sour cream and pickles (gross!) but then a manager quickly came up behind that person and said \"it's like tzatziki sauce, it has sour cream and cucumber and such...\".....shady! I realize that Greek yogurt is probably more expensive than sour cream and cucumbers are probably more expensive than pickles, but guys, please don't insult Greek people and food in this manner.  Don't be so cheap, if you're going to run a Greek restaurant, you have to use Greek yogurt, NOT sour cream!"}
{"text":"I love Showmars. It's that simple. Really missed them when I was out of state few a while. But I never had breakfast. Today I did, and had been wanting to. Glad I did. Never again. Service here was ok at it's? best. Not like the other locations. The food was again ok at best. Had a omlet with very little fillings. Hash browns were good. Was never offered a refill of my tea. Lunch and Dinner yes for sure. At this location don't think so."}
{"text":"Every employee greets you and goes above and beyond to make sure you are having a great dining experience!!  The food is delicious and fresh.  VERY clean and in a cool location with other eateries & unique shops!!"}
{"text":"Love Showmars! Their food is always delicious! Customer service is satisfactory. Always a clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a decent Showmars. Service is usually pretty good. Food is exactly what you would come to expect. Restaurant is always kept very clean. The parking lot can be a bit hairy depending on the time of day."}
{"text":"I love eating at showmars but I have to say the experience tonight wasn't that great. Food took a long time to come out. It came out cold. Ordered tartar sauce on the fish sandwich and there was barely any on it so it It was extremely dry. The fish itself was cold, extremely thin, and chewy. Just a really disappointing meal from a restaurant that I usually love. The onion rings on the other hand tasted amazing and homemade even though they were served cold. Had to wait a while to get crackers we asked for to go with the soup and for the extra tartar sauce. I give it three stars because this is the first bad experience I've had at a showmars.  It can be difficult to get in and out of the parking lot just because of its location but don't let that deter you from checking it out. I'll be back to this location one day but until then I will stick with the Park Cedar location that has never let me down."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like Showmars because it's local, but it's just kind of icky in the environment. It was probably a unique spot before they spread all over the area, but now that Charlotte is super-saturated, it's just not that interesting.   The french fries are ok, I guess. The veggie pita is no good...clearly designed by someone who has never eaten food without meat on it. Maybe I was disappointed because I had high expectations, and maybe it's an alright place for the meat-eaters...but it's just not good for me. I haven't had a good experience, and I've been to a few locations. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have been to this location for breakfast for a few times.  Always super quick and friendly service.  There is a large parking lot for the restaurant and it gets hopping!  I usually have eggs and turkey sausage or the biscuits and gravy.  Everything is always cooked well and comes out fast and hot.  The coffee is what you would expect - nothing fancy but does the trick.  The prices are always reasonable and I have never had a bad breakfast here.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Went to Showmars in Elizabeth and got in at 9:25 (I didn't realize that it closed at 9:30). Went to order a pita and the cashier rudely explained that they were out of grilled chicken. As I was trying to determine what else to order, the cashier stood their impatiently slapping a menu in her hand. I immediately walked out as this is not the customer service I would expect at a place where I am paying to eat. Very disappointing as I live in the Elizabeth area and figured this could be a easy spot to visit when in need of something quick."}
{"text":"Always have been a fan of Showmars but never tried the breakfast there.  I wasn't dissappointed at all!  I had a turkey sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and loved it.  Along side of that I had a bowl of grits made perfectly.  The service at almost every Showmars is what I think really sets it apart from other chains.  It's always friendly and I feel like they are eager to please.  Not for nothing, the stores are almost always very clean.  It doesn't take a lot for me to be impressed but Showmars does it for me if I'm looking for something as close to fast food as I feel like getting without the terrible food of a typical fast food joint."}
{"text":"Here's a novel thought: when you get tried of waiting in line for a table at some of Charlotte's more well-known breakfast spots and you come to the realization that $10 for a couple of eggs and hash browns is a little too steep, come on down to the heart of Elizabeth and get with the program.  This is as close to a neighborhood diner as you can get.  Very recently renovated inside, the light and color scheme is much brighter across the range of booths and tables that fill the space.  While there is a menu on the wall and a take-out counter, breakfast is table service and the truly Southern ladies who wait the tables will welcome you in and invite you to pick your own table.  I've never had to wait and I kinda like being able to pick out my own digs- is it a window kinda day, or do I want to bury into the back corner?  Menus are on the table and they have all the regular breakfast staples.  Omelets, waffles. eggs your style, hasbrowns, and all the usual breakfast meats. While I usually skip the meat, I do appreciate the fact that turkey sausage is always an option.  Service is speedy and the ladies who constantly walk around will make sure your drink never goes empty or that your coffee always stays refreshed- no matter if they took your order or someone else did.  Now that's some customer service.    Another thing I really like is that they recycle newspapers from earlier guests.  I can usually find several whole local papers stacked up in a central location to be read and returned as \"community paper.\"  I can get caught up on the affairs of the day and pass it on.  What you'll really love here is that the prices are so easy on the wallet.  When both my wife and I can have a full breakfast for under $12, with tip, then I am amazed.  Try to find breakfast for one for under $12 at some of the \"other breakfast places\" around town- their biscuits may fly, but they will weigh your pocketbook down!  Now this place, like all other Showmars, serves a lunch and dinner with plenty of Greek staples, including a pita burger.  I'll save that review for another time.  Just know that this location in particular has plenty of local color and the breakfast is a nice, relatively undiscovered gem of a breakfast spot right in the shadow of uptown."}
{"text":"Always check your food for a Togo order before leaving this location. I am a vegan and I specified that I wanted a vegan style veggie burger but my food was not prepared correctly.  They gave me the wrong side dish and didn't have my drink prepared. I would think twice before ordering here again. Im giving two stars because of their kind service."}
{"text":"portions are horrible.. 12.00 for a fish and shrimp platter ask for no coleslaw extra fries.. no extra ordered a salad only want to give two dressings... spent almost 30.00 and barely any food"}
{"text":"I really only go to Showmars for the pitas, but they do have a good variety of quick food. I wouldn't go so far as to call it fast food, considering it takes a couple minutes for them to bring your food to your table. They're a Greek themed restaurant, but really have a good variety of options. It's a quick little stop for some good, cheap food. It is a chain restaurant though so you're gonna get the same stuff at every location."}
{"text":"The French fries always taste bad here.  Sometimes worse than other days.  The fries have a flavor note that suggests \"rotten.\"   Do you guys ever change the cooking oil and clean the fryers?  Apparently not.  Today I forgot to order something else instead of the nasty fries, and got stuck with them.  Could not eat them.  It is too bad, because everything else that I have had here is pretty good.  And I eat here at least 3 times per month. Just have to remember to sub out the fries!"}
{"text":"Order/Food:  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!  They always have a daily special that is a good deal.  Our favorites are: Chicken Pita, Grilled Chicken Chef Salad, Greek Salad, Fish Sandwich, and to splurge the Pita Burger (Watch out this one has a LOT of calories).  Atmosphere:  You order at the front and the staff brings the food out to you.  Sometimes the service can be slow (You might get your food before your drinks) but overall really happy with this location.  Stay away from Monday nights  unless you have children because the balloon guy is there and its kid central!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I'd tried breakfast at Showmars.  Not sure how many of them are serving breakfast.  It might just be this location because of where they are located.  I definitely agree that Showmars may have been better when they are smaller - what are they up to now, some 30 locations?  I'm happy for them and all, but they just lose something when they are no longer trying as hard.  The staff is friendly enough, but it's not that much different from your typical breakfast service at any diner."}
{"text":"Everybody loves Showmarssssssss... and it shows. The commercial is now stuck in your head. Oops. My bad.  Now that this is my neighborhood 'Mars (why yes, I did just give Showmars a nickname), I get a little sad every time I come here. Why? Because it doesn't have Alex. He's my favorite worker at the Freedom Drive location.  I love the Grilled Chicken Santorini. Tzatziki sauce makes everything better. I'm also a big fan of the Greek Grilled Chicken Salad. Not sure how healthy it is if you eat the entire bowl, though. You have to eat the bowl. It's a must.   SHOWMARS ALSO HAS THE GOOD ICE. You know what I'm talking about. I think it's about time I make a \"Good Ice List\" on here. When I become president, I will make all restaurants carry the good ice. GOOD ICE FOR EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"Fast Greek food is what Showmars does best. This isn't sit down full service Mediterranean cuisine, it's an Americanized version of Greek favorites like gyros and other American classics with Greek touches. I went with simple gyro, great part is I was able to get it with extra tzatziki sauce. My son ordered the grilled cheese but the bread was pita. My mother had a shrimp po'boy on pita and dad had chicken salad on pita. No complaints at the table. Showmars is a solid choice."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time at this location, I'd been here several years before and looks like they have recently remodeled this inside and outside.  I like it!  I looks a lot better than before.  I came at lunch and was waited on right away.  The lady taking my order was friendly and quick.  I took a number and sat down to wait for my food.    I came within 3 minutes and was fresh and delicious.  The customer service was great!  There was an employee walking around to check on tables the whole time I was there.  She was extremely attentive.  She made sure people had refills and boxes if they needed.   Had a good experience!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong at showmars! I always hit this place up twice a week. Great food!"}
{"text":"Really good pitas and salads! Great customer service too! Food always hot and fresh! Portions are really huge and enough for 2 people! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for here! This is my weekend breakfast joint. And it's a solid one. My fav: $4.99 Country Breakfast (2 eggs, bacon or sausage, and a biscuit covered in yummy gravy). A much more affordable option than John's and the likes. During breakfast time, this is more a \"full service\" place. Just take a seat and one of the ladies will stop by to take order. This one waitress somehow remembers me (or rather my odd way of drinking coffee... which is to half and half it with hot tea, topped off with creme and sugar) and is super sweet every time she sees me. You can always find some newspaper to read as well on the bench by the door. On a nice day, outside seating is quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"I called in an order and it was ready for pick up when I arrived about 20 minutes later.  The staff members and I had a few laughs and I was on my way.  I noticed there were dirty tables awaiting cleaning but I suppose they were taking a quick break from the breakfast crowd.  As I was on my way, I realized I didn't have my drink.  I circled back, entered the restaurant and they quickly handed it over.  The food was good, as expected.  Therefore, 4/5 stars for this location."}
