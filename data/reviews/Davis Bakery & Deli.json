{"text":"Pickles aren't very dill ... tastes like a cucumber!  fatty corned beef, small for $9 and not allowed to get small bag of chips instead of dry crumbly cookie"}
{"text":"I had the Reuben. It was awesome! The Rye was grilled to perfection. Crispy and crunchy. Just the right combination of corned beef, dressing and sauerkraut. They give plenty of corned beef, but it is the right proportion to eat in one meal.  Had a bag of chips and can of diet Vernors ginger ale.  While there they had Hamantaschen cookies. They were great."}
{"text":"They have great pricing for fresh hot and amazing food.  If you are in the area it is definitely worth the stop whether you want a sandwich or some pastry or even just some lunch meat."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this review short and simple.  BEST corned beef ever."}
