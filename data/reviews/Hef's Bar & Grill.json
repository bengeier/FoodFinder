Drink specials. For my VIP pass, I can get a free drink everytime that I go to the bar. I love this local spot just to chill"}
{"text":"I went to Hefs today. The waitress was one of the rudest people I have ever had wait on me. The menu said oysters were .60 cent each. It also said you could have them raw, steamed or fried. So I said I want 12 oysters. The waitress snapped at me and said you can only get ten at a time. I said OK then I would also like the steamed. She said that's only for the wings! Huh? Steamed wings? I said on just bring me the oysters. Then when I asked for horseradish sauce she practically threw it at me. I have never been treated so bad by a waitress in my life. I always tip. Even if it is a Chinese buffet
 If they are nice and refill my tea. I leave a tip. I did not leave this girl a tip. She came out of the restaurant and flipped me the bird! Food not worth it and the treatment not called for! I will never go back there EVER!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Hef's since their opening night. I almost always find myself satisfied. The place is rarely crowded during the day. The staff is very laid back and generally friendly. One thing I have noticed is they must have a subscription to like ESPN6 because there always seems to be some offbeat sporting event on their TV's. 

I have always enjoyed my food there. Yes, always. They have a good burger, excellent turkey club... yeah it's not a complicated menu but they get it right. There's not much to the salad if you get it as a side so I'd probably opt for the fries or pay extra for the mixed veggies. I haven't had the wings in a while but those were pretty good too.

Unfortunately, as of January 2010 they no longer do lunch hours. I told you it was never crowded in there so I guess that's what happens. That kind of sucks.

My one gripe? They're charging in the 8 to 9 dollar range for many of their sandwiches. I have no problem with the price because it's quality. But for God's sake, their house ketchup tastes terrible. If I'm paying top dollar for a good sandwich, can I get a decent ketchup for the burger or fries? It's like having Marilyn Monroe as a model and dressing her in parachute pants. C'mon Hef's, you've gotta do better than that."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, not a bad price at around $5 for the wrap I had- southwestern chicken wrap. Jay say Au bar- smells a little dirty and the bar looks cluttered. Terrible location for the bar in the restaurant by the way- but they bought the building as is. 
The wrap was very good. Opted for chips and salsa side. Salsa was good and tasted fresh (I wonder if they made it? ). Never understood why multi-color tortilla chips are used ever- these were red, white and blue. 
I'll probably come back in an evening to try the fried oysters out."}
{"text":"New location for this reataurant. Very comfortable atmosphere.  Wings are really good.  Also had a big black and blue salad. Very yummy.  Staff was efficient and friendly.  Will definately return to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place. You get great service. I been coming here for over a year. Their wings and nachos are soooo good. The music selection is good. The patio area is well layed out and comfortable."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad. Only good thing is the drink prices. It's the middle of July and they presented it on top of an open faced burger...it was barely pink and was the core! Omg, clueless!"}
{"text":"Holy shit it's good, and cheap! 
Great deals on football sunday, too! $15 got me drunk and full!"}
{"text":"I have had both great and really poor experiences at Hefs. The most recent one has been atrocious. Standing at the bar waiting for over 30 minutes for a to go order they said would take 15 (when I called 15 mins ago from my car). Lots of inebriated patrons in the bar and music blaring louder than I have heard maybe ever in a bar. We walked over to the restaurant area to wait but it's not helping... jury is out on how long it will take to get the order. (It was wings... that doesn't take long)."}
{"text":"The location isn't ideal, but I think this place will survive due to their cheap drink prices and due to the fact that there isn't any real competition for a bar/restaurant in the area. 

The food is decent, but the menu could use some work. The place has a hard time deciding what it is, offering Thi dishes and steak next to wings and burgers. They also need to add more and better apps, especially considering it is primarily a bar. Don't expect to be wowed, but the food is okay. 

The drinks are crazy cheap, but that also attracts a certain cliental. The place kind of seems dirty by default. 

In short, not a bad place for a drink and quick bite, but they need to work on their identity."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Good food - yummy burgers and wraps, cheap beer, and I've never had to wait for a seat."}
{"text":"My husband and I always enjoy Hef's. The atmosphere is cozy, yet usually hopping and exciting. The clientele is usually quite diverse. Their fried tomatoes are delicious and the drinks are good. Great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"This was my second visit at Hef's. I must say that this is my new favorite place. The first visit I ordered the Jerk Flounder wrap. It was excellent and the fries were hot. Today I ordered the Coconut Curry Chicken. The vegetables were so fresh and the dish was excellent. Bud light is only $1. The price of the wrap and curry were both only $6-7 each. Clean and friendly place."}
{"text":"What has happened to the quality here? When they first open it was great, no so anymore. Even the kids Mac and cheese looked and tasted like the cheapest Kraft box. Will not return again."}
{"text":"The bartender with the blonde hair was very unwelcoming and seemed disturbed by the sight of two black men.  Not sure why but her inability to offer a smile caused us to promptly retreat and spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"World's smallest bar! I kept seeing Hef's and was excited to finally go there. Total let down. The staff was friendly but the drinks just weren't good. The couple next to us kept raving about how much they loved Hef's so I really wanted to love it too, but it just fell short. I did not use to bathroom, but my guy friend did. It's bad when I dude come back from the bathroom and says \"Call the CDC. We should geet out of here\"."}
{"text":"HEFS IS THE PLACE TO BE!!! Every time I'm in town for work this is a must. Bonnie has got to be the most efficient and kindest bartender I've ever met. She makes you feel like family and makes sure you are satisfied and taken care of!"}
{"text":"Food was great.. but the service not so much. Took a long time for our waitress to take our order. When we did get our food one order was completely wrong and it took quite a while for them to bring back her correct order. The food was very good and very affordable."}
{"text":"Too bad that Hef's didn't stick to basic bar food and do it well.  They have a confused menu, with a mixture of American, Asian, Mexican and other. Some items are decent, while others are very lacking.  The worst is selling Kraft macaroni and cheese as a selection.  I don't know about you, but I think that is nasty.  

My suggestion to you as a potential customer is don't bother...not worth it."}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday with Joel to grab some dinner.

[+]
Food. My chipotle burger was thick and delicious, and so were the fries. Interesting to note that they won't cook your burger past Medium, so be comfortable with some pink.
Atmosphere. Relatively small interior and dark red wallpaper with black flourishes worthy of a comment.

[ - ]
Location. Seems an odd place for a 'bar.' It's off the street and surrounded by tamer chain stores.
Price. The majority of the menu is 8.95. I got a burger and despite it being delicious, include two beers and it's a 14 dollar meal.
Service. My food came back exactly as I ordered it, almost."}
{"text":"Awesome Food&Drinks great prices $$ they usually have dollar beers. Great service and location and awesome management"}
{"text":"I love coming here.  Good prices, friendly service, big servings.  Great place for a quick lunch or a long easy dinner."}
{"text":"Service is a hit or miss. Tonight is was no good but last time it was great. The food however is always great."}
{"text":"When a regular customer forgets their wallet, you should be able to accept their spouses payment over the phone. Your policy not to allow that loses me as a regular customer."}
{"text":"Feels a little dated.  For a place that I pictured as \"bar food\", the bar is tucked in the corner and not really a part of the ambiance.

Food was decent.  The wings (Buffalo sauce) are some of the best I have had in CLT.  Big and juicy with good sauce (not swimming in sauce).

Burger was average.   

Bloody Marys were thin and very meh. 

Our server was excellent.

Overall, prices were very good a decent value"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. First I wanted to say what great customer service we received! Chris was our server and he was very pleasant and gave excellent service! The food was great! We tried the oysters, wings and also the buffalo chicken wrap and the French dip all were delicious!!!  The prices were awesome, drinks were good! Clean and a great atmosphere, we will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"There food was great!! The fried pickles Spears were great. They were not heavily breaded which I really enjoyed. You were able to taste the pickle. I ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap and it was good. My wife ordered the chicken and avocado sandwich which she loved. The best part was there delicious fries!!! Some of the best I have had."}
{"text":"Pretty hip place background music is staight hip hop. But I loved it. Now on the the food the portions are huge. I ordered a salad wing pot stickers and onion rings for a party of 3. We took home leftover! Yummy will be back"}
{"text":"Glad to see them back in business, and definitely on this side of town.  Wow!  that's a lot of TVs; I think around 28 big screens, so you won't miss the action when dining out.  

Prices are very reasonable; $8 for a sandwich and the best fries, ever!  I've been there twice at this location, and I had the Godfather sandwich, which was delightful.  My wife swears by the chicken sandwich and salads.  Will probably try the seafood on the next visit.

Service was very good, with adequate smiles all around.  We went on Thursday night, hoping to beat the weekend crowds, and found it still fairly busy, so the word is out.  I'm glad to have a place like this near Matthews; more upscale than fast food, but a place where you don't have to get all dressed up to enjoy yourself.

Overall, good food, good atmosphere and good location.  We will be back.  :-)"}
{"text":"CONSUMERS BEWARE!!! Double check your bank/credit card statement if using a debit/credit card at this place. I ordered a takeout on 5/26/2018. My total came to $26.98. Although, I never tip on takeout orders, I left a cash tip. Imagine my upset, when my card was charged an additional $4.00 when it posted. I contacted the restaurant on 5/31/2016 to discuss the transaction. The Manager \"Kristen\", didn't even bother to research my transaction before immediately offering to refund the additional charge/tip. Kind of makes me wonder if this is a standard business practice. The food is decent. So I am not discouraging anyone from patronizing Hef's. If you eat at Hef's, use CASH!"}
{"text":"So I came here with my best friends for some drinks really didn't like the music I
Don't want to listen to trap music at a whole in the wall bar but he bartender was cute and nice I'll just come back for her"}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch today.  My boyfriend loved and scarfed down his chipotle burger and fries! My chicken caesar wrap with chips and salsa was amazing.  We had lunch and some drinks the restaurant looked great.  The waitresses were pleasant and helpful and we delicious  meals! Two meals and multiple beers at an incredibly reasonable price.  So glad Hef's is only about a mile away from my house! I will be returning again and again!"}
{"text":"The family and I decided to give this place a try on a Sunday for lunch. They have LOTS of TVs and a nice atmosphere. We were seated immediately. Without going into every detail, the food was average to good, but our waitress was out of it. It took her literally 10 minutes to put our order in the computer. 10 more minutes to bring the hubs a second beer, etc. Other people with other waitresses seemed to be very happy with their experience. 

I had the crab cake sandwich, the hubs had wings (big, but he said the sauces were indistinguishable), kid 1 had buffalo chicken wrap and said it was good, kid 2 had tenders and said they were ok.

We may come back again, but nothing was so stellar that we would go out of our way to do so."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm disappointed with Hef's. We've gone there quite a few time and the food and service was always good. Based on our history there I would have given them a 4 . ( I really wish we could do 1/2 stars.)
The last time we went the service was good but the food seemed to be heading in the wrong direction. Not bad, just not as good as it was before. That was until we got our wings. There in the center of the pile was a flat with the tip still attached and ALL of the feathers we still on it! Gross!

We went again tonight, because the have a chicken avocado salad that we both like. Every time I ordered it in the past I always felt like it should have a nice chunk of bread with it. That was the only negative. Tonight, it all went to hell! 
Our waitperson took our order and left in a reasonable time. It didn't appear they ahd any other tables as they weren't that busy. After we ordered our salad we decided we'd try the wings again, but...no waiter. After 5 or 10 minutes, they finally showed up. We ordered the wings and waited on our salads. When they cam they both looked good, but...The greens and  cukes were in HUGE chunks. The lettuce pieces we a foot long. I mean it was really hard to eat and guess what? No knives! The chicken was hard and dry as a bone. Even with a chunk of tomato, it was still dry and flavorless. The blue cheese was in big chunks (good), but didn't look like blue cheese. I was pure white (bad) The dressing was lacking in flavor, too. Overall a real disappointment.
Oh, yea, back to the service...tick tock still waiting for the server to get a knife. Finally after the wings were ready (they said in 5 minutes, but it turned in to 15) we got to ask for a knife. The wings must have been ready in five, but not the server cause they were not hot. When you can pick up a wing and bite into it and not burn your tongue, you know they have been sitting a while. They were ok, not great.
The server did not check in on us 1 time, only to take our order, deliver it and bring our check, except when we waved them down They asked me then if I wanted more coke. 
I don't know if management is on vacation, they got a new chef or what, but I'm going to think twice before we visit again. One bad night (even feathers) ok, we all have off nights, but this looks like a trend. Unfortunately, the wrong way. I hope I'm wrong because we really did like the food there before!"}
{"text":"We've been a couple of times and the service has been good and the wings great. They have good drink specials every night. For the price I think it's better than Hickory Tavern for a similar menu and experience."}
{"text":"After frequenting this restaurant since they were located at Park Rd., I will not be returning. 

I came on a Sunday afternoon with two friends to enjoy seafood and drinks, and it turned out to be short-lived. 

We were greeted by the hostess as \"how many?\" and later seated by a dirty table in an empty restaurant. A guy immediately emerged and began SPRAYING the table towards our direction. I asked him not to spray the table towards our direction, out of fear of the chemicals within the bottle. I ended up getting sprayed by whatever was in the bottle and asked for a manager. 

I will not be returning to this establishment. I understand that people have a bad day, but this situation was totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Had an experience at Hef's this evening that I'm still trying to wrap my head around, hours later. My husband & I met our 2 friends at Hef's for dinner at 6:30. Wasn't very busy and after a couple minutes, we were sat by a friendly girl (who had to clean out the seats first), then she took our drink orders.

About 5 minutes, a guy came by and said he'd be right with us but asked if he could get our drinks. We told him other girl had taken the drink orders (1 tea, 1 water, 2 jack & cokes). He communicated with her to sort out what we ordered to drink. Eventually he returned with drinks and took our meal order (on a thin napkin). 

All was normal, he seemed chill. After a while we noticed food was taking a while. We'd been to Hef's maybe 2 times before and service was always kind of slow but friendly and tonight we had time since our movie wasn't starting until 8p. So we didn't stress it. A hostess (assuming it was hostess but it wasn't who sat us) came by and asked how we were; all cool. More time passed and the girl who sat us came by and said our food was coming up now; it was then we realized it was now 7:15, some 25 minutes after we'd ordered, 45 minutes after arriving. 

The guy who took the drinks came out shortly after with my husband and his friend's food. They each had fries so he asked if they needed Ketchup and they said yes. He came back with ketchup, sat it down and disappeared. We thought he was coming back with my and my friends food. He didn't. We waited, didn't see him or anyone for a bit & when I finally saw him, I gave a little wave and pointed at table to say that we didn't have all of our food yet. He put his finger up in a \"oops, one moment\" type of motion and ducked into the kitchen (we were seated in last booth next to kitchen entrance). Five minutes go by and he doesn't return! By now my husband and his friend were halfway through and had stopped eating to wait for us. Finally, we see him again on other side of restaurant and as he walked our direction, I and friend waved to get his attention and without stopping, he yelled \"I'm not the cook, bro!\" and then mumbled something as he went into the kitchen. 

We were shocked, almost thought it was a joke. But again, minutes pass and he never returns. Finally I saw the assumed hostess, got her attention, explained what happened and that we still didn't have our food and running out of time. Nearly 7:30 at this point! She apologized and the guy walks up while we were explaining and the hostess asked him did he say something to us. His response was to say \"first of all, I don't like to be waved at. Second, y'all were being very disrespectful and extremely rude\" and all of our mouths dropped. Even though we had valid reasons to be aggravated, we had still been cool & friendly about it all. I was a waitress before and I'm very big on service. All of us are currently in or have been in customer service and we are never, ever bad customers. We are easy going, big tippers, quick, quiet. We are not dramatic or run the waitstaff crazy or anything. So for him to suddenly flip on us and say WE were being extremely rude was a shock. Then it gets worse. 

This waiter went from 2 to 10 in seconds. He was leaned on the back of the booth, literally so close he was touching the shoulders and back of my friend as he stood behind him, so friend told him to back off of him and the waiter starts saying \"oh you threatening me?\" My friend says \"you're behind me, in my back, yelling -I'm telling you to get off me or we're going to have an issue.\"  The waiter starts saying \"Oh you want to do something? What you want to do?\" (Challenging stance as if ready to fight). He had a knife in his hand (presumably from whatever he was doing, not necessarily pulling it but he had it and was yelling so who knows what his intent was). The hostess was trying to tell him to stop it, to shut up, to leave. She eased the knife from his hand. I was seconds away from calling 911- that's how he'd escalated it. At that moment, yet another waitress walks up with the rest of the food, which obviously at that point we dismissed. Then hostess ushered the shouting waiter away into kitchen.

She then came back, apologized and said \"it's crazy back there!\" She asked us if we wanted her to get the owner -said he was was there. We said we just wanted the bill so we could go. Didn't want any freebies or anything. She insisted on getting the owner. A few moments later, out comes this guy who didn't speak English very well and we are almost 100% positive he was NOT the owner. (Can't confirm that but nothing professional/authoritative about him). Anyway, he mumbled an apology and gave us 50% off the food, we put money on the table & assured them we'd never return. This whole experience was unlike anything we'd ever experienced, anywhere. That place isn't professional or safe and I'm almost guessing it was not first time and guy won't be fired. What a wreck."}
{"text":"Wasnt a fan of the \"please seat yourself \" method. I had to find a server. When I did,  she was apologetic and very nice. 
Food took a little longer than expected to get but It was was worth the wait and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the avocado chicken and crab cake. Both were delicious and well seasoned. 
Prices were better than good. Total bill under $18, before a tip. 
Clean restrooms.
Great tvs. Great spot to gather with friends. Premium drinks only $6-$8."}
{"text":"Awesome service. The bartender Christy was attentive, fast, and hospitable. Love this bar... would visit again definitely!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special to see here. Food is mediocre early good and the bar is boring. I probably will not be back but who knows! Very dimly lit so I didn't really enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening about 8 for dinner. We were seated right away and the hostess took our drink order because the waitress was backed up. Not s problem. There was a huge party in the back. Friendly staff but they need more of them. The waitresses are running around like crazy. We were waiting on friends who were late but we went ahead and paid. When they came they sat with us and the waitress came back to take their order but they had just sat down and we're looking at the menu. She never came back?? We asked the hostess to send her over because they had been waiting for a while to order. A different waitress came said our other waitress had left and didn't know where she went?? This one was good and friendly but she was running all over the place. Food is really good though that's the reason for the 3 stars. But be prepared to wait around. They definitely need more wait staff in here."}
{"text":"I don't think I had the normal experience here.  I walked in with a fellow yelper hearing about how awesome this place was and I wasn't disappointed, but not really sure what the deal is.

I stumbled in after a very long day just looking for that Bell's 2 hearted on draft, and I got one very quickly.  I then decided to walk to the bathroom to do what I needed to do, when I saw a guy videotaping an extremely wasted and out of place looking asian guy kinda peeing on himself.  I started to ask questions but eventually just walked away.  I went back a few minutes later to find a \"jugalette\"(female ICP fan), guarding the men's bathroom for one of her friends.  This all seemed so out of place, but its what happened.

I was tired and not expecting much but I got a show whether I liked or not.  Don't expect the same as this place probably does not see this crowd often.

I will be back to try those tasty wings I smelled, and to have more than one strange but great beer."}
{"text":"I really like hef's. I wouldnt call it a hole in the wall because it is a very nice place but it is almost a whole in the wall because of its location. It is set in a corner of a shopping center on park road. I really enjoy going there during happy hour as they have some killer deals."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been up to have drinks a few times now and have enjoyed it very much! The bartenders are friendly and the drink specials can't be beat! The food is OK the wings were good but the burger and nachos were just so so. But definitely a great place to watch the game and grab some wings!"}
{"text":"We came here to grab dinner and ended up just grabbing some happy hour oysters and drinks. Their happy hour specials include the whole restaurant not just the bar. The oysters were great especially for 60 cents. They had $1 bud lights and really cheap drinks. This is a great place for cheap drinks and bar food. It's weird because it's set up like a restaurant with a total bar feel. We ended up eating elsewhere because none of the food looked that appealing. We will come back though but next time for the bar! 4 stars for the sheer fact of how ridiculously affordable their prices are!"}
{"text":"Located at Woodlawn & Park Road just under Jason's Deli.  Great sandwiches and wraps for lunch and nightly dinner specials.  Kudos to Hef's for being open on Sundays when the restaurants across the street at Park Road Shopping Center are closed.  People gotta eat every day of the week!

I would call it an upscale neighborhood pub.  Service can be slow when they're really busy on Friday and Saturday nights.  But that's not the time to go if you want lunch or dinner in a friendly \"Cheers\" type atmosphere.  

Also, FYI, these guys are not affiliated with Hugh Hefner and Playboy in any way.  It's a straight up bar and grill."}
{"text":"Ok, so I just left Hef's on 10+!!! After eating  and not tipping because receiving less than stellar service from my waiter Emilio.
Let me start by saying I ALWAYS tip according to service. Therefore, I didnt leave Emilio because of his lack luster service.  He did the basic minimum of his job. He took my drink order then a few minutes later he came back and I  ordered my food. I ordered a side salad w/ my dinner  thinking it would come out before the dinner entree but it didnt . So, when he brought out the dinner and the salad at the same time I said I thought the salad would come 1st. He said you didnt tell me you wanted it 1st . I said  didnt know I had to tell you. Then, he goes on to say this is not 5 star restaurant this is a sports bar. I said it doesn't matter but whatever.  After that he nva came back to check on me ,refill my tea etc until it was time for the check. I asked for to go container for the  salad and someone else had to bring it along w/ the top for the dressing. At that point, I decided he did not deserve a tip. I paid for my check and I was leaving so I thought.... I hear someone say \"ma'am \" I look back it was Emilio.  He said I need you to come and clean off your table since you did not leave me a tip. Then he proceeds to walk up on me and tell how rude I was not for leaving him a tip and how everyone knows I have an attitude and if I didnt want to leave a tip I should've went through the drive thru and how the owner would agree w/ him. Then the  hostess chimed in stating, he was nice to me and he is one of the best waiters. How in the hell would she know if he was nice to me? Hell , I had to get her to bring the cover for the dressingThey both went on to tell me how much he gets paid and said tipping is required and Emilio stated it was a law. I was so discussed I had started cussing . I've never have been so humiliated ,embarrassed  that I had to make scene over my right not to tip for service.  After I stated I will be posting my experience the hostess(she didnt tell me she was hostess til after the fact of me stating I was going to post) then asked me did I want to speak to the owner.  I said hell no since you want to act like your are the representative for Hef's and Emilio. I did tell her  to shut the f up and stay in her lane. Btw , I have patronized this place at least 25-30  times  since I've moved to Charlotte and I never have had an issue until now and due to this issue I do think I will be returning.  I also , work for a company that frequently uses you for parties. I will be letting my company know how I was treated at this establishm"}
{"text":"Ok, let's face it, no one enjoys giving a bad review but honestly the food was horrible. The only thing that saved this experience from me ranting on about the food was the fact that the manager did come out to apologize and took my meal off. Hubby had a burger but it was 'very' well done. Waitress must have been having too much fun with her work friends. Friends, go to steak and shake next door."}
{"text":"The first time I noticed Hef's was YEARS ago. There was a sign outside advertising their happy hour oyster, wings and shrimp. I meant to go back to try the crazy cheap specials, but slowly forgot all about Hef's through the years.

Recently, I had an oyster craving and Hef's came to mind. I was able to stop by and luckily, they STILL have the same specials! The prices went up a little bit, but are still reasonable. Oysters (cooked/raw), wings (mild/hot/barbalo) and shrimp (grilled/raw) are all $.60 each. For $.60, the oysters are pretty fresh and decent in size. Although the size does vary by season, the overall quality is pretty good. If you're not much of an oyster fan, the Barbalo wings are to die for! What is Barbalo, you ask? It is a mix of buffalo and BBQ wings of course (which sounded amazing, which it amazingly was!) The wings are drenched in this dark redish/brown sauce (Barbalo sauce I presume) and still retains its crunchy texture. All wings are made fresh to order! I'm not much of a shrimp fan, but maybe you can try and let me know if I'm missing out.

The perfect complement to my meal was a quaint space with a lit fountain for outside seating. Charlotte is slowly warming up and it was a beautiful day to enjoy the fresh air (even the pollen was low that day!)"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill, I order pasta I had one bite and left it there. Burgers meat Dry! Very disappointed not ever coming back here"}
{"text":"Tonight was supposed to be a good night. We were celebrating our friend's birthday. However our server Jillian did not allow us to enjoy our night. First, she was very flighty and her attitude the whole night was as if she had somewhere better to be. Maybe she had an emergency, which management should have let her take off. She would ask us if we needed something and before we could answer she was rushing off. Then someone gave her a box a cigarette box while still on the floor. I don't know about you, but that's kinda gross. THEN the food comes out. Everyone's comes out, one by one, except mine. She comes around five minutes after the last person gets their food( none for me still) and asks how is everything. We notify her that I still don't have mine. Another 10 minutes go by and nothing. I see her zip out of the restaurant presumably to smoke the green box of cigarettes I saw earlier. Finally after 15 minutes I get my oysters, although without my fries(which are clearly indicated in the menu). Then after about 15 minutes she comes back in and finally gets to our table and I inform her I didn't get my fries. She said she would discount it. So we were ok with it. But then she grabbed some silverware(for her end of night duties) and sat in the booth next to us and kept staring at us so viciously in an attempt to have us leave(as if we were there for 4 hours, even though it has only been about an hour). Soon after that she went into the back and brought her phone out to the table and began texting, then looking back at us. She even called another waitress over and kept talking to her and looking at us, obviously talking about us. I finally couldn't take it any longer and to make my friend's birthday more bearable I tried to ease the night and we got our checks and left. It was just a night that was supposed to be a fun night that ended up being pooped on by the service. We still left get a decent tip (20% versus 30%) but discounted the fries value she had told us she would have($3 value). 

Then I just called to ask for an email since there was no email on the website and Winter answers the phone and  \"Hellooooo?\" Not a friendly greeting. I ask if this is Hef's and she confirms it is. I ask for an email to complain and she says \"Hold on.\" Instead of putting me on mute, she laughs and makes fun of the fact that I want to make a complaint. Not a great image of the bar. I'm sure there is good business, but I will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our order came out cold & all the breading was totally off of the buffalo shrimp.  The floor manager says to me....\"I don't know why....we have a heat lamp\".  Really???   So she goes to get the owner.  He comes out and says \"what's the matter\".   I tell him my order is stone cold & for him to look at the presentation.    His reply \"So\"!!!!     So he goes back in the kitchen and apparently asked the kitchen staff about my shrimp.  The owner comes back to my table...gets in my face and says the kitchen staff denied sending my food to me like that.   He argued with me & made me cry.  I begged him to leave my table.    He had the nerve to give us a bill.    I used to go here three times a week.  

Beware!   Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The fried shrimp and wings are delicious!! I always enjoy the food and great service."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere for sports lovers with a low key vibe. Very casual with an extensive menu for anyone to enjoy. Waitress was very attentive but forgot to place our appetizer so the meal came out before the app. We both ordered burgers and they were great! My friend is very picky but he loved the Black and Bleu burger and I ordered the Chipotle burger."}
{"text":"Missed my $5 lunch special today I was running way behind but still enjoyed the grilled chicken Caesar wrap. Hot, fresh and delicious, probably the best I've had.  Great lunch specials here til 3pm I advise a visit.

My server Michelle prompted the review, never had someone more attentive wait on me. Thanks Michelle!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials with shrimp, oysters, and wings many different ways.
They also have some great frozen drink specials.  
It's nice sitting in their patio and people watching."}
{"text":"We came up here to watch the NFL draft.  We split a Avocado blu cheese salad. It was amazing!  Our server was also amazing!  New fav hangout!!"}
{"text":"Met some friends for dinner at Hef`s tonight.  This was my first time but I will DEFINITELY be back.  They have a friendly staff and a diverse menu.  We shared the nachos supreme for an appetizer and I was pleasantly surprised.  They are not your ordinary nachos.  The queso and black bean chutney make these the best I've had!  I ordered the steak tips for dinner and loved that too.  It was served with rice, vegetables and a hibachi style sauce.  The food AND the prices are outstanding!  I will be back for more."}
{"text":"OK, let me just be real honest and say that I was not at my most lucid when I ate my to-go order of nachos. I could tell they weren't bad, though. The bit I had later on was cold (my own doing), but tasty.
When I called to place my order,  the guy on the phone was REALLY helpful. I usually just deal with the mess when I order nachos to go, but he was the one that suggested multiple containers. Awesome,  because I didn't want to be the jerk asking for all that.
Picking up the order was pleasant as well. The bartender was polite and friendly and came back to me several times to assure me my food was being prepared and packed.
The biggest plus of all, though? Having something besides tacos, pizza, and burgers to eat after midnight!"}
{"text":"This place is on point! I went few days ago with a friend.. I had  never been & I was craving oysters & someone had mentioned this place had them,
I just happened to b on this side of town as I live in Indian Trail.... Ok let me tell you I was initially impressed with the bloody Mary I ordered.. they had my favorite mix but they went far & above & added lots of extra goodies.. horseradish, worschishire sauce, lime,  celery ,olives etc. needless to say that was a damn good Bloody Mary. Ok now the food pretty good oysters but my favorite was actually the freshly cut veggies, wow what flavor & variety.
Last but not least the phenomenal service we got!
I mean I'm talking good stuff here.. Nancy was our waitress & was very professional.
Well I'll definitely b back that's for sure.
You had me at hello
Such a great team here at Hefs
Great job guys, keep it up."}
{"text":"$5 for a key chain where you get 1 free beer a night?  HELL TO THE YEAH YEAH! I usually only come here during the week ( okay once a week after bowling), but the free beer lures me in.  The bartender is awesome, such a great personality and is always available.  The food here is actually pretty decent as well.  This place has one of the best buffalo chicken wraps I have ever had and the fries are decent.  The only thing that takes a way is that it is usually a very young crowd.  When I get there around 11:30 it is usually whiteboy wasted 21 yr olds who are obnoxious.  It doesn't bother me that much, but it may bother some.  Needless to say, this is my new go to spot for some food and a beer during the week when I am in the area."}
{"text":"After coming to Hef's for almost a year now, spending hundreds of dollars, we were treated like TRASH last night. It was St. Patrick's Day, and the place was obviously busy. 

It was around 9 when we arrived. We were seated by the hostess and our waiter was kind and tried his best to get drinks out to us in a timely manner. We order food, which consisted of about 50 wings, two orders of fries, and cheese bacon fries. The bacon fries come out really quick. No complaint about those. But we continue to wait and wait and wait for our wings. About 45 min later we get tired of waiting and start noticing people around us getting their food before us, even though we arrived first. Then we see the table behind us receiving complimentary fries for their wait. We start asking about the wings and the fries (which we wanted to come out first). We still hear nothing from the owner/manager or whatever he is. 

Finally, I get up to pay for drinks so we can take our business elsewhere. The \"owner\" comes rushing out the back and is very hostile with my table. Right away he is blaming us, the waiter, the day, anything but himself and the kitchen. I ask what he can do for us and he yells \"50% off that's it\". He is making my table VERY angry with his hostile attitude so I step away from table to pay and leave. Once again he won't let me pay for drinks to leave. He is YELLING at our waiter and blaming him for our wings taking so long. Asking a THIRD time to pay he is still yelling in the kitchen. Left a 50% tip for our waiter for his excellent service and then we left. 

I choose to call them back to let them know about our experience, hoping to get an apology for the service. I finally get the \"owner\", Danny, and he is angry and rude with me. He keeps interrupting me and cutting me off asking what I want him to do. I didn't want free food, I wanted a sincere APOLOGY for the way HE treated us. All I got out of him was excuses and blaming other people for his incompetence as a manager. 

We will NEVER return to Hef's again. Not after the way Danny treated us and our friends (new customers) we brought in. Don't waste your time or money here. They are not loyal to their loyal customers."}
{"text":"Chicken wings w/honey mustard looked like baby vomit so I was hoping they would taste better than they looked.  I was disappointed & ate only 2 wings leaving the rest. Great place to watch a game :)"}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte!  Best drink specials!  and hands down some really great service.   

I recommend the 4-7 specials every day."}
{"text":"Food... awesome..
Service, the worst I've ever had. Currently waited 20 min for ketchup. There are only 5 full tables and 2 servers yet no one will check on us. Waited 3 min just for the hosted to come out of the back to sit us. Horrible horrible service. Never coming back. Also way too cold in here."}
{"text":"If you have ever watched an episode of Bar Rescue and wondered if it could be true, you owe yourself a visit to Hef's.  Shots given out without cause or order, peopele seated at the bar ignored and a bar tender who runs off every three minutes.   I wonder how this place makes money. ......"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars to frequent. The food is amazing, the drinks are great and the bartenders are so friendly. Anytime is a good time to go to this bar. I love the location. I live on Providence? so there's not a large variety of places to go out this way. Hefs is one of the best places over here."}
{"text":"We had never been to Hef's despite 3 years of frequenting the Park Rd shopping area. We've now gone twice in the past month. Why??? 
First they got us in there with an Entertainment Book coupon for buy 1, get 1 dinner. Sweet. Then at that first visit, they gave us each a VIP card to come back for a free beer every time we visit after 10 PM (in December 2011, you can get your free drink any time of day!). 
So of course we came back for our free beers. The free drink doesn't even have to be a Bud Light or cheap domestic beer, you get to pick one at the time you get your card, so we both got a free Highland Gaelic Ale. Not too shabby. Combine that with their Happy Hour (until 7 pm) 40 cent wings or cocktail shrimp and you've got more than enough reason to go check it out. Their wings were pretty good, surprisingly meaty. Not a huge beer selection, maybe 6 on tap (also had magic hat and southern tier ipa at the time). Seems like every day they have some sort of drink specials. i feel like i'm making this up now that i am typing this, but i swear i saw some sort of frozen drink machines in there. 

Hef's is a pretty small with only about 8 tables and a bar, but it seems like a fun place. We had different girls waiting on us each time and both times they were friendly and actually seemed to be enjoying their job.

Almost forget to mention that the first meals we had were both excellent. i had the Smokin' Brunette (chicken breast ,Apple wood-smoked Bacon, Cucumber, Fresh Mozzarella, Lettuce, Tomato, and honey mustard Dressing on a warm Croissant) which was very filling and delicious. The buffalo chicken sandwich at the table was very good, not as spicy as i like it though. 
 
If you're like me and appreciate a free drink just for stopping by, you better check out Hef's."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, cool place for drinks they have bud light $1.25! Truthfully between the drink specials and the tvs everywhere this place is perfect for sports games. Ordered a salad maybe that wasn't the best idea looks like the chicken was from a can, in fact it was chicken from a can......stick to the drinks. Waitress was attentive and understanding after telling her about the salad she took it off the bill with no question. Nice bar size."}
{"text":"I love this place so much for many different reasons.  I have been a regular since almost the beginning.  Now I almost always get the Turkey Club sandwich which is to die for.  Most sandwich bar and grill places don't use such fresh ingredients.  The bread they use for their sandwiches and burgers are soft and just perfect.  They can be toasted for those who prefer toasted bread.

My girlfriend always usually gets the veggi pita, it comes with a dill sauce that is to die for.  Now if you go here you have to try the fries.  They are some of the best fries I have ever had.  The fries are made from yukon gold potatoes, fried to perfection.  I have never got greasy, overcooked, or under cooked fries here.  I usually am not a fan of large wedge shape fries but I make an exception for these.

As far as the atmosphere goes it is great for that small bar feel.  There is outdoor sitting, which usually has music outside on weekends.  The bar is small and does allow smoking for those that don't like to be around smoke might want to sit outside.  

I love the staff there for so many reasons.  You feel like they aren't trying to just get a good tip but to actually be generally kind to people.  If you don't know what you want they will definitely offer honest and great options to choose from.  They have even given me free concert tickets once.  Like I said I go there a lot.  I haven't eaten at the bar or got many drinks here, but I heard the bar area is great to enjoy.

As far as price goes for bar food they might be a dollar to 2 more than most but I say well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing  the barbalo wings are the best flavor I have had in a long time. The wait staff is attentive and has great customer service every time I go here it always a great time. I had the chance to meet the owners and they are really nice people the lay time we were there we also tried the nachos with Chicken yum yum lol but it's a really great place to have some great food and hang out with some friends"}
{"text":"When I Ate meat is was decent so 2 stars for that I'm a vegan I literally order french fries and ask  for them well done on at least 4 occasions now and each time they are less and less cooked like seriously a crispy french fry is that hard that each time I end up with underdone fries! I'm done!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after work this past Friday. 

I really hope this place sticks around..so far no business has lasted too long at this location but I think these guys can. 

They have lots of TV's and a decent looking bar. They had $1 Buds as part of their  grand opening specials. I tried the hot buffalo wings and they were decent. They didn't give me a lot of celery compared to boardwalk billies or bww but the price was fair.

The service was a little slow with the bartenders disappearing for a few moments at a time. Overall though as long as these guys have better service than boardwalk or bww, they have a chance to be successful."}
{"text":"We are new in town, and used Yelp to help us find something that was open late, and had good reviews..

Love the low key environment here. The food is amazing! I'm hooked on the veggie pita. Happy hour prices are very reasonable. Staff has always been so friendly! I will definitely make this one of my \"go to\" spots in town!"}
{"text":"Great staff, yummy sandwiches, and awesome drink specials! I hope I can make it in during their happy hour for the cheap and delicious shrimps. I split a fried shrimp wrap and the brunette sandwich with a friend and both were very good! Two thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"The snob in me has a prejudice against any bar a in strip malls, but I ignore that bias often because Hef's serves food late and my friends seem to like going there after they get out of working the late shift. It's usually not very crowded, but still very smoky. I'll have to try it for dinner to get a different perspective."}
{"text":"Arrived at 7 pm last night, no one at the host stand. Waited 10 minutes before the host came to the station. Several waiters and the bar tender saw us standing there. Final showed up and asked us to wait a minute. went to the back to get a menu. He said something else, I could not hear him, very soft spoken, walked away, then came back. Another couple came in and the host sat them instead of us. We of course walked out, have never been treated so rudely in a restaurant. Will never return, first impressions last forever."}
{"text":"Husband and I went to try it out as we really miss another mid range restaurant in the area.  They are having growing pains, I believe, but are trying hard.  Meals were nothing to write home about...just okay.  Guacamole was way too salty.  Service was friendly.  Will try again in a few months to see if things improve."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. We had the dumplings appetizers and some wraps. The dumplings tasted like water and the chicken in the wrap was dry. I believe that we paid for frozen food, but I could be wrong. Maybe the food just tasted bad.

Service wasnt good either. Some server's comments seemed unprofessional enough to raise one eyebrow and question his basic social skills. The food arrived on strange intervals, serving one of us and then giving us enough time to finish the meal before the next person in our group gets his/her food.  Sadly, the place only had a few customers so I doubt it was due to the lack of help.

My \"clean\" napkins had sauce on them."}
{"text":"1st time at Hef's, will not be back. Went in @ 4:45, not much crowd. Started with fried pickles, hand breaded, very good. Could have used more then 2 ounces Ranch for 6 pickles though. Ordered Black & Bleu burger, medium, came out well done and dry. Bun toasted but cold. Small sprinkle of Bleu Cheese, 1 tomato slice and 1 thick piece of Romaine lettuce with rib still in? Couldn't eat it. Also ordered Turkey Club on croissant. Turkey very thick slice, like pre-sliced lunch meat. Manager said that's the way they slice it here and it's not going to change!
 I have been in the food service industry for 37 years, would not recommend Hef's to anyone!"}
{"text":"For a place called a \"Bar and Grill\" Hef's has one of the smallest bars I've ever seen. I wish they had renovated more, it basically feels the same as when it was O'Charley's back the day (except now they have a bajillion TVs AND a giant Bud Light neon!!).

The bar was packed, so we got a table even though we were just getting drinks and snacks. The beer list is just ok - again I wish they would add some more local breweries. Hef's can you hear me? (if you can, please add some OMB).

For our food, we tried the nachos and wings. The nachos are a solid \"good\" - tri colored chips, not greasy and topped with queso,  a \"black bean chutney\" and the other usual suspects. The wings were better than most places - meaty and lots of flavor options. We did half hot (which was manageable, no sweating) and BBQ Honey Hot. They happily brought extra celery, although I can't remember if there was a charge or not.

The place was slammed this particular Friday night. Our waitress was very very nice, but she was so in the weeds. Luckily we weren't in a hurry...I actually felt bad for how overly busy she was. I noticed a couple tables having issues and the manager appeared to be taking care of it, so that's good. 

Clearly there are some things I'd love to change about Hef's, but I'm still going to give them another shot, mainly because it's so convenient!"}
{"text":"I was in the area, was craving some wings, but I didn't feel like sitting inside somewhere. So I asked my friend who had some good chicken. I was directed here. I picked up 20 wings, 5 Cajun, 5, Garlic Romano, 5 Chipotle and 5 Barbalo. My favorite of the flavors was the Cajun. It was smokey, spicy, wasn't all greasy and overall tasty. The Garlic Romano was a close 2nd favorite, but it was a bit greasy, still smashed though. Lol. I can't really elaborate on my dining in experience since I ordered takeout, but their patio is really nice and the bartender was friendly. I'd totally come back in the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Decent spot with plenty of parking. Upon entering wasn't greeted but the environment seems pretty relaxed. They have daily drink specials and the food is okay. I came on a Wednesday night where they offered half off wine bottles so we got the sangria. It was refreshing. They have a limited amount of wines on the list and instead of trying something that may be horrible we stuck with sangria. We made a good choice. It's a pretty popular spot. I got the shrimp wrap which was delicious. The side choice of chips were okay. The lemon pepper wings were different and the fries were okay. I may come back to try the other items people recommend."}
{"text":"Been here once I ordered the wings they were good nothing overly special I don't think it was memorable enough for me to go back"}
{"text":"I can't review the food because we didn't stay long enough to get our meal, or even our appetizers. We arrived nearly two hours ahead of another meeting and were seated immediately. Our server was pleasant, and we ordered an appetizer and our entrees. About an hour later, we were told that the kitchen was really backed up and that it would be some time before our food came out. We told the staff we had to leave for time's sake and grabbed fast food on the way. They need to figure out the kitchen situation, as they'll have huge problems if they are backed up when the restaurant is still empty."}
{"text":"I went into Hef's last night and had a wonderful time.  Amy was our server and she was wonderful.  She took our order efficiently and very courteously.  At no time did we have to go looking for her.  She made sure our needs were taking care of.  When we completed our order, she did it with a smile and was very bubbly in attitude.  Our food arrived in a reasonable time and well cooked well.  The food was excellent.  The fries were whole cut potatoes and fresh not frozen.  Amy is what good customer service is about.  She was attentive, courteous, with a positive attitude and made sure you were welcome to be there.  She really liked working there.  I would recommend anyone to go to Hef's Bar and Grill.  Don't forget to ask for the artichoke dip.  It is really yummy."}
{"text":"You know what.  I dig Hef's. I visit ChArlotte a lot for business and this place delivers well on the friendly bartenders, good bar grub and some arcade machines to keep me busy. Is this the place to satisfy your foodies desires, no. But when I miss my local bars back in Minneapolis where I curl up with a beer and a City Pages, I go to Hefs (when in CLT please replace \"city pages\" with \"creative loafing.\"). The only thing I don't dig is the top 40 pop rock music, but hey dirty hipsters speaking, it's 
my job to disapprove of music."}
{"text":"There's always a varied crowd at Hef's and it's never packed so it's a great place to just chill.  The drink specials and happy hour specials are unbeatable. 50 cent oysters are great. (I think the special runs Sun - Fri 4 - 7pm)and Wed night is half priced wine night."}
{"text":"I love Hef's! Great small bar, wonderful service, and great food. Everyone is always smiling and I have never seen a frustrated customer. It is a great place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving Hef's 5 stars is because I've only come during happy hour and I've only ever ordered the chicken wings and oysters. And know what? That's all I really want. I'm satisfied. The wings are freshly, perfectly fried, not greasy, and come slathered in barbelo sauce--a mixture of barbecue and buffalo that's sweet with a solid kick of heat. Since they're only .30 cents a pop (and oysters .50) during happy hour, you can come here with your buds and get it on, drinks and all, for around $10 including tip! 
Plus, they have one of the most famous servers in Charlotte and gorgeous burgundy velvet flocked wallpaper. Hmmm. Think I'm going to add that fifth star now."}
{"text":"I hope the guy that made their website was drunk off their beer specials.

Went there for a karaoke night and it's not the best venue for something like that. The karaoke guy had the words on the TV behind the singer so everyone was turned around."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times with buddies during happy hour. It's a bit smaller than I expected. We sat at the bar and had some nachos and wings. They were pretty good.

They have very good drink specials at happy hour. 

Service is pretty good and they have some tvs too.

I haven't been here at night, but I imagine it gets lively.

Overall it's not bad, and if you're looking to drink or eat on the cheap, come here for their happy hour specials. And I wouldn't mind coming back. But I think I'd prefer the many other bar/restaurant options around (I.e. duckworths or the many options off Montfort)"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had an awesome meal at Hef's and had a great time. Great food (although, the oysters had a little more grit than I like). The cocktail shrimp were so great and the wings were perfect. They have awesome happy hour food specials every day, and good looking drink specials. The bartender who was there at the time, Bobby, was very attentive and on point with refills. It is a small place so get here early. But otherwise, Hef's is going to be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"the wings are very good with an assortment of varieties to choose from. The typical bar with the wall full of televisions and your typical patrons at the bar. Great place to go if you need somewhere that's open late"}
{"text":"Awesome service, terrible oysters, amazing grilled shrimp old bay sauce wrap.  Stiff cocktails. 4-1=4 stars."}
{"text":"Great food! Mediocre service.... Pricing and quality of food was excellent.. Server was not attentive.. We received more attention from the manager/owner our server."}
{"text":"Hef's replaced (something - O'Charley's, perhaps?) a while back, and while we do not get there often, we do stop by every once in a while, as it makes for some variety in the dining circuit.

Their menu offerings are reasonable, and provide for about what you would expect in the fast casual arena - sandwiches, salads and the like. Most of them are priced similarly as well.

The real issue that we have run into is that service is very spotty. While they are very friendly when they get to your table, getting them there is the real challenge. Even with a nearly empty restaurant it can be several minutes before being seated, and another ten minutes before someone takes your order, glasses can go empty for a while, and even if they do notice you are waiting on refills they seem to take their time getting back around. Ultimately it can be a frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Thier food is pretty good! They have screwed up my to go order a few times but it's better to dine in."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and hot. Hef's chicken came with the red sauce. I wish I would have ordered on the side. The dish was good. The smoking chicken brunette and fries were delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. My first experience was at lunch around 1:00. I ordered a margarita and it was kind of small. There house drinks are just OK. They have great specials on beer and they have drink specials everyday.  For lunch I ordered the spring rolls to start and the crab cake sandwich (which is pretty big) to eat. Both were excellent! For some reason my food took forever to come out. I got my appetizer right before my meal.  I was with a party of about 7. The second time I came for dinner I was with 3 other people. It was a Saturday night and we got seated right away. I ordered a turkey club. I had the least complicated order and it was still last to come out. They brought my fries a few minutes after my sandwich, which was kind of annoying because I already had to wait. My food was really good and I left full. My friend ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was huge and delicious! They do not short you on food and you get your money's worth! One of my new favorite spots."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and food after work one night with a buddy. Instead of having the bartender wait on us we found ourselves constantly waiting on her. Food was decent as well as beer prices but service was awful. She never formally came to us to get orders, instead screamed at us across the room. Also had to wait on her to get our checks while she smoked cigarettes. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Ok, folks, here it is short and sweet.  With a name like Hef's ...you never know what to expect....or at least i didnt.   

An old OCharleys converted into a stand alone \"sports bar\" with tons of TVs.

Hours: open until 2 AM...which means decent food (thats not fast food) LATE.

Bar is in an awkward spot...however, the bartender really knows how to mix a drink.  She nailed my friends obscure request.

The Menu:  not just your typical bar food...but they have that too.   My friend got a steak which was cooked perfectly.   I chose to eat off their Asian flare menu.  Mine was Chicken and veggies with a Thai Red Curry.....it was OK at best...but you cant expect Thai House food at a bar.  They also had other things like Burgers, Nachos, Chicken Strips, Pastas, onion rings, etc.  

All food was served hot and cooked to order.

Waitress and hostess were both cute as a button and really friendly.

I hope this place makes it....because there is a very limited number of places to eat in CLT after 9 pm. Nothing ever seema to last long on Sardis Road North....but i hope they can pull through."}
{"text":"Wings were awesome. My boyfriend and I are so picky about wings. These were so crispy and awesome.  The Cajun sauce was dope. We will be back"}
{"text":"First time here and had lunch , menu had many options from seafood, to wraps, sandwiches, burgers, wings , entrees, and chef's specials. Portion sizes are average but filling , taste is good, service was good , if you want a nice family or friend bar atmosphere with fair prices and good taste , it's a nice new spot .

Wow, 2nd time was complete opposite from first. Food had no flavor , portion size was very small for price . $45 later it was a waste of money and I hate wasting money on mediocre food"}
{"text":"This was pretty good.  I haven't been here since it was O'Charley's and glad I came back to try Hef's finally.  Service was very friendly and fast.  My drink never went empty which is a star deduct for me.  I wanted something different than my usual standard lunch fare so tried their Godfather sandwich which is roast beef, copocolla, lettuce, tomato with mayo and Italian dressing and it was really good.  Fries are breaded which I don't care for but that is subjective and they were cooked right, they also offer a side-salad or chips and salsa for a side so next time I will try one of those.  Sports bar type atmosphere and feel.  Overall a good lunch experience!"}
{"text":"I hate giving this place two stars because the food is really good, I mean really good, but the service was awful.  It was a Friday and steady, but not overly busy. We were seated right away.  It took about 15 min for anyone to even greet us. When the waitress did, she took our appetizer order and then disappeared until after the appetizers came out to take our dinner order.  She was very scarce throughout the whole visit.  My friend's order came out wrong, but she never bothered to come and check...we had to flag someone else down to take care of it.  Then after waiting 15-20 minutes when we were all done eating, had to flag someone down again to see why my friend's food never came back corrected. Not cool.  Very annoying. The server wasn't friendly, just very bland...& her device sucked BAD!!!! A huge disappointment!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I got the grilled shrimp wrap and my bf the black and blue burger w/ added bacon. It was great! Well season, prepared as ordered and friendly service."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening around 7 and this place was pretty packed. We ordered some wings and a wrap. Service was really slow but the food was good and cheap. Good drink specials as well."}
{"text":"Friend and I came here while visiting a friend in this part of town. Has an upscale sports bar energy and the food was amazing! Please do yourself a favor and have the crabcake sandwich. I've made two special shopping trips down here, both heavily motivated by eating at this place while out."}
{"text":"Ordered nachos and wings.  Took awhile, both delivered at the same time with no plates.  Food runner said, \"be right back with plates\", never saw him again.  Unenthusiastic waitress took forever to mosey on by only to say \"huh....so they didn't bring the nachos out first?\"....upon which I said \"makes no difference, I've had no plates for 10 minutes and counting\".  Also got no carrots for the wings which we explicitly asked for instead of celery.  The nachos had ground beef added...which was a crumbled up hamburger patty...which was excellent......made the nachos awesome....shoulda got a hamburger.  The wings sucked.  Overly hard......probably were sitting cold and unsauced then thrown back into fryer once ordered.  They were smaller than I like and the sauces were *MEH*......very lightly sauced and no personality in the flavor (chipotle bbq tasted like Kraft BBQ sauce).  Took forever to get a refill on my Coke.  All the waitresses and runners I saw seemed kinda scrungy (think dirty bar in NODA) and spent too much time congregating in the doorway to the kitchen on their smartphones or gossiping with one another. 

Overall this place was disappointing.  The menu was wonky, had a whole page of Asian inspired dishes...which make no sense at a place like this.  The wings sucked and considering Buffalo Wild Wings is right down the street.....save your money and go there.  Hef's was great over at the Woodlawn shopping center.....this location missed the boat."}
{"text":"This used to be awesome. Now it's full of drug dealers and a slow, high staff. The food was either over cooked or under cooked. We got chips and dip, and they gave us chip crumbs! Stay away"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, had heard great things about it and finally made it. It is conveniently located in a visible spot with conspicuous front. 
As soon as we walked in we were greeted and sat down in a comfortable spot. Our waiter whom we speculated is related to the owner was awesome, was patient, attentive and gave us superb service. Our party was a bit large and different people asked for extra this and that at various times which was a little annoying for me because I don't like bothering waiters excessively, but this young man was so quick and friendly as well as professional. Our food was super, tasty and hot! I was impressed by the large quantity in portions that were served; I had the blt with avocado and boy that was crispy and generous with plenty of bacon and avocado, not too much mayo and big chunk of a tomatoe, it was heaven. We also had the fried flounder at the table and I gave it a tiny bite which was so flavorful and had delicious breading. I will be trying that next time. Restaurant was clean and pleasant, it has the sports bar feel without the smell. Overall I was truly impressed with our server whom I believe did awesome for such a large picky party."}
{"text":"I am reviewing the Hef's on Sardis Rd!! OMG...after we had a terrible experience at Kristopher's bar & grill, our group decided to head over to Hef's! Can I say THANK YOU....THANK YOU....THANK YOU!!! Not only was Ryan (our waiter) the Bomb.com but everything was amazing!

We arrived at Hef's because we had a unpleasant racial experience at Kristopher's bar & grill. When we got there, immediately Ryan (our waiter) began engaging with us. Friendly, smiles, open to answer food questions, etc. Out of 8 people only 1 of us had been there. Well I can say we have already made this restaurant our \"Go to\" for hanging out. The food was great, service was AMAZING and the music and atmosphere was perfect. Not only did Ryan remember the orders but he remembered small details of condiments for each of us. He even pulled out the chair for my female friend when she returned from washing her hands. Chivalry is not dead (smile). 

If you want a great experience and awesome service, check out Hef's on Sardis Rd. and ask for Ryan!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Mecklenburg county period lol!!!!! It's a low key spot with amazing food & the French fries & the wings are perfect.. I've never had a bad experience & I always recommend this place to people because they deserve to have this restaurant slam packed everyday! Great service, drinks and most definitely music"}
{"text":"One of my go to's for lunch! I don't work too far from Hef's so I'm here pretty often for lunch. I've only had their wraps and they are all so good. And their fries are really good too they are like extra crispy. They just went up a dollar on their lunch prices (from $5 to $6) but it's still so worth it. You definitely get full. The wrap is huge and you get a side of choice fries, side salad, or chips & salsa.
I haven't ate in, always order to go but the hostess and bartenders are always nice and helpful when something isn't right or missing."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the perfectly cooked, hot, and crispy fries that came with our orders. I ordered the jerk chicken wrap for lunch ($5) while the hubby ordered the buffalo chicken wrap ($5), both with fries. The kids ordered chicken fingers (which are huge) and another child ordered Mac and cheese (it was $3 for an order that was the amount of a third a box of Kraft Mac and cheese ). The jerk chicken was sweet and spicy with a sweet Jamaican relish. The wrap it self was toasted and crispy, not like anything I've ever seen before. I definitely loved the flavors and will be coming back! Thank you for the great service and accommodating for a family with four young kids."}
