{"text":"GREAT CORNED BEEF!

No joke.  This place may not get the accolades of a slyman's, but it is the real deal when you are looking for a true corned beef sandwich in downtown cleveland (without the line).  The sandwich itself has no frills; consists of 1lb of corned beef, slice of swiss, rye bread with pickles and mustard on the side.  You will leave full or with leftovers.

I went with coworkers for lunch and got a table inside.  The decor is late 60's, but thats not why you go.  Karl himself was working behind the counter and was really nice.  Service is good and price is fair.  It's also about a block from the Browns' stadium.  Stop eating the hype and check out the real cleveland corned beef sandwich at Karl's."}
{"text":"Just for a little clarity, the July 2, 2010 review is talking about the downtown location.  This Karl's Corned Beef & More is actually one of a handful of outdoor enclosed stands in the middle of Crocker Park (in the plaza between Cheesecake Factory and Vieng's).

I was pretty excited when I heard that Karl's was coming to Crocker Park, anticipating tasty oversized corned beef sandwiches.  Now, the only thing I can think of is \"overpriced.\"  Compared to a place like Corky & Lenny's, you simply do not get much corned beef for your money.  Calling their featured sandwich \"King Corned Beef\" just seems wrong.  Even more overpriced was the potato salad side--a little container of \"meh\" for $5.  The one positive is that they give you your food in a nice black box container.

Sadly, I can't really suggest alternatives for corned beef sandwiches in the area.  Chipotle and Dave's Cosmic Subs are on the other side of the Crocker Road parking garage and worth a look over Karl's."}
