{"text":"My family enjoyed a delicious meal here, the food tasted very fresh, excellent quality and the portion was generous. We had the hibachi steak and hibachi chicken. The servers did a great job, also. The chef came out and was very interested that we were enjoying our meal. We'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The place must have been sold again.  It was a great place but I went there for lunch today.  My wife and I ordered the same thing which said it came with soup.  It did not specify which soup it only says soup.  As we have always ordered we ordered the hot and sour soup which was never a problem under the old ownership.  The waiter came back to us and said we can only have the Miso soup.  I do not like Miso so I said it does not say that on the menu.  He went back to the kitchen and the owner was very adamant that even though it does not specify this we can only have the Miso soup.  My wife and I said no Miso for you and walked out and we will not be coming back.  The owner's attitude was he would rather lose a customer than provide what we ordered and have ordered every other time we went.  The food used to be good but with such bad service we will go to one of the other ten different Asian places that would gladly offer us Hot and Sour Soup if that is what we wanted.  It was a weird experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Everything we tried was good, especially their kimchi jeon pancakes. Highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Favorite Asian Fusion place  Korean Steam buns are awesome Sushi is awesome  Both master chefs are also very cool"}
{"text":"Placed a to go order, after placing the order I noticed the sanitary rating was not good. Wished I would have cut my losses at that point.  The food was awful.  Ordered generals chicken was bright orange and fried rice that was wet and gummy.    The cashier was nice but not knowledgeable.  I had to wait about 25 minutes for my order.  Tried once, won't go back."}
{"text":"We placed a huge order last evening, all the food was fantastic.  We had a mish-mash of Korean, Chinese, Japanese - Sushi.  All of the food tasted great.  We generally don't respond well to food with MSG and found out that Bob Zip does not use any MSG, a huge plus for us.  The hibachi chicken was fantastic.  The kids loved the Lo Mein.  The sushi roll I had was every bit as good if not better than the rolls I've eaten at sushi only restaurants and priced very fairly.  The Korean plate I ordered was the best I've ever had and I've eaten at a good many Korean restaurants.  I noticed a couple of the negative reviews and maybe those folks had a bad experience, however our experience was the exact opposite.  We also noticed the sanitary rating as being an A.  All in all a really nice experience and we are looking forward to returning frequently."}
{"text":"Bob Zip recently opened. Located on Chestnut Rd at Potter Rd our first experience was fantastic. We ordered a number of items to go, chicken lo mein, steak and scallops, soups and the chef even sent us home with a sushi sample. Steak/scallops phenomenal. Sushi very good.  We had 4 adults and 5 kids and everyone enjoyed everything. You also get a delicious pickled side and egg rolls. There is a small dining area however we got ours to go. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"8/14/14 I returned to the restaurant with a few of my friends to eat lunch the other day. My friends were a little skeptical because of the name of the restaurant and also they said the food from the previous establishment was tasteless. The decided to give the restaurant a try since it was under new management.  It was about 7 of us. We had combination of Japanese Hibachi (Shrimp and Tofu), La Kalbi, Singapore Curry Noodles (Shrimp), a Sushi sampler and combination fried rice (chicken,beef,shrimp, and pork). By the end of our meals, we all agree that the food was delicious and definitely a go to restaurant for Asian cuisine.   I returned that evening to get Nigiri because my friend Alan said that loved it in his Sushi sampler. I liked it too but the Rainbow Roll is still my favorite YUM :-) !!!  Today, I just purchased egg rolls because my other  friend purchased them previously and said they were the best she ever had thus far !!! For some odd reason I thought there was pork inside because I don't eat pork but it is just vegetable. She was right they were excellent. I had one with duck sauce and other without. You can eat the egg roll without anything on and it is still delicious. You can tell they are handmade.  I had to scrutinize this restaurant a little because  I live in the community and the previous restaurant of course was no good. We need delicious Asian cuisine here. They are a keeper. I hope they stay and prosper with the community... OK Bob Zip you passed my palate test and now I will leave you alone :-)   Also my last review should be 8/06/14 not 10/06/14 . I apologize for the error.  8/12/14 I tried Bob Zip's  Agedashi tofu with bonito flakes. It had me salivating, it was so good. I did not want to share it with anyone. I will be returning for more for sure. :-)"}
{"text":"Really bad.. I ordered egg drop soup and it had an awful consistency and no flavor!! Steamed fried dumplings were dry and seemed microwaved, not steamed at all!! Like dry chewy skin! Yuck!! The sauce was pure vinegary.. Blah!!!! So disappointed.. Never again! And I am not one to comment unless really bad or good! Who messes up egg drop soup?? So simple! You are chopped!"}
{"text":"What a disaster. We waited 50 minutes for a deep fried spring roll. 1 hour + for two entrees. We were the only diners in there. No plans to return."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer for the last year  The food has  always been above and beyond"}
{"text":"Take out or eat in the food is always delicious & worth the wait!!! We love the mustard soup, Kim chi pancakes, rainbow sushi roll,  General Tso's Chicken is awesome with a hint of spicy-ness. The  passion put into the food shines through each flavorful dish. You  can tell the chef has a flair for taste & Asian fusion everything is so fresh & tasty! I can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! This place has an expansive menu and the offerings are very tasty to say the least.  I have eaten here 3 times now and they are quite consistent.  There is only one chef so it makes sense.  Very pleasant gentleman also. Fresh ingredients and lots of TLC.  Portions are spot on and prices are very resonable. This is now my go-to Asian restaurant in town. He covers Korean, Japanese and Chinese."}
{"text":"So, you say you're going have mee krab and I say No! No! No!  We have been really anxious to try this place but unfortunately their health rating was initially below our standards. However, tonight we noticed that a rescore was a 95, so we tried it!  It was terrible. Realy terrible. My General Tso chicken had ketchup in it. The miso was the best thing we had and it was instant. Even the fried rice wasn't good.  How does any Asian restaurant screw up fried rice?  Seriously, avoid this place. We gave it a 2 instead of a 1 just because it is nearby."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!   My wife and I have had multiple dishes as well as sushi, and it's all been delicious!  The chef was very helpful at explaining the menu and a delight to deal with.   The Korean BBQ is by far my favorite.  The most authentic we've had in the Charlotte area.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've now eaten here 3 times. Tonight we tried the sushi. As someone who lived in Japan for 6 years ... I love sushi and I'm critical of it. We had the volcano roll and tuna and salmon. The fish was fresh and the volcano roll was exceptional. Be warned though he uses fresh jalepeno in the roll! We also had the Octopus salad-very good! The Korean pancake And the Szechwan beef dish-- fresh and delicious! I hope he gains popularity...he needs a bigger place and beer!"}
{"text":"Sushi bar?, japanese, and Korean =Terrible, Terrible, and Terrible. Food is tasteless. Chef attitude is terrible. I'm not going back to bob zip waste of money and my time."}
{"text":"I live close by and just placed my first order this evening - hibachi chicken.  I was very pleased with my meal...lots of nice white chicken with lots of veggies!  It came with an abundant amount of rice as well as two dipping sauces and soup.  I am so happy to have this place so close.  It is definitely my new \"go to\" place!!!  I think the less fanatic reviews were probably from when they first opened and had a learning curve.  Definitely worth trying!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place NO star if I could.  The only nice thing was the cashier/waitress. I had dine with my boyfriend and the waitress was such a novice. Although she was nice and respectful, she knew nothing about the menu and kept going to the back to ask the manager. The manager was the rudest person ever! He was yelling at her, as if we couldnt hear him, asking her what did we ordered. We had ordered something on the menu that they did not have. So why is it on the menu when you don't have it? Then we asked the other waitress to turn on the tv and she didn't know how. She asked the manager how to do it and he yells from the kitchen, again, saying he is busy. She apologized. At this point I didn't want to stay anymore. The environment and all this yelling is so disrespectful, but my boyfriend said we could at least tried the food. There were other customers coming in and later the manager comes from the back acting all nice and asking the waitress she don't know how to turn on the tv or what. So fake.  When our food came out, the miso soup was nasty, tasted like salt water. The bulgogi was SOUR!! I mean, has anyone ever eaten sour bulgogi? Do sour bulgogi even exist? You can tell there was a lot of MSG. The salmon roll was small and tasteless. The food was definitely not worth the money and pricing.  I thought cho won garden was bad; this place is the worst.  One more thing, there's no sushi bar."}
{"text":"Awful experience. Will not be returning. I'm assuming the cook was the owner. It was only him and one server at lunch. Server was slow, but not awful. Cook/owner was getting onto him about not writing ticket correctly.. Then began to ask our table if we knew anyone who he could hire, that this guy just didn't get it.. Right in front of the server! That was none of our business and the poor kid shouldn't have been blasted like that. Service was slow.. We waited 40 minutes before we got our food. We ended up not paying for our lunch but only because he realized it was an issue after we brought up our extremely long wait, which he tried to blame on the server and was very, very rude about it. He was not to blame for the wait! Will not be returning and will not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I had Bob Zip for lunch today, and it was absolutely the BEST express Japanese experience I have EVER had.  The service was wonderful, and the food was to die for!  I highly recommend this restaurant.  Bob Zip please open a new location in Clemson, SC (where I go to school.)"}
{"text":"My sister and I tried this on Monday and we could not have been happier.  The double tuna sushi was amazing.  The scallion pancake with kimchi was out of this world.  The gentleman who worked there was friendly and fun to chat with.  He is very passionate about his food!"}
{"text":"I've been here for a few times for lunch. They have a wide range on the menu. The restaurant itself isn't big. Their lo mein noodles are pretty good. I've had their egg rolls and they were crispy and fresh. My friend has had their soup and really enjoyed it. The staff was really friendly too!"}
{"text":"The server was very rude to us. Asked him for go chu jang ( sauce that comes with bi bim bop) he said he didn't have it. Asked him for side plates, he said he didn't have it. Food wasn't good. I won't be back"}
{"text":"The best handmade egg rolls I ever had.  One thing I didn't like was the place was too small."}
{"text":"Ii thought the food was surprisingly good!   I had the Chap Chea and it was delicious. Plenty of food.  Shrimp roll was handmade and there were big shrimp. Miso soup was fine. I mean, miso soup is plain to start off. Can't do too much with it.   The waitress was super nice, short blond hair and really friendly. I didn't see the owner or anyone \"yelling\"at her. Prices were fine too.    I had take out and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall and have a few tables but most if not 99% of their business is take-out.  Average bordering on bland tasting food. I had the fried rice, beef and broccoli and a spring roll.   It is close, cheap, and the portions are better than average."}
{"text":"Very good food. Reasonable price. Primarily a take out place. Dining in has excellent portions but prepare to wait. Look forward to expansion."}
{"text":"A very strange name for an Asian restaurant! The lo mein is good and service is decent. Nothing special or to rave about, but nothing bad from what I've seen. The prices are a little high, but if the food quality is good, willing to pay a little more for it. May try again."}
{"text":"this was my first time eating bob zip's food but all i can say is i'm impressed. i'm a vegetarian that loves sushi so finding a good  Japanese and sushi place with a lot of vegetarian options is hard, but this place has so options. i had the veggie rolls and they are some of the best i've tasted. i saw a lot of the reviews were negative but i see no reason why. the place is kind of small but most of my sushi orders are takeout so that isn't a problem. i'll definitely be visiting again to try some of their other options."}
{"text":"the worst take out ever! burnt crab ragoon, slimy pepper steak, lo mein with shrimp ....just tolerable,egg rolls nasty and general tsos chicken even worse!!!! $40.00 later....we threw away $35.00 worth of crappy food....never again...customer service ....great! but that's all....."}
