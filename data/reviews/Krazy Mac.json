{"text":"I have been here 3-4 times and LOVE the Soutwest mac and cheese.YUMMY!! It smells SO good. It has a nice bite and the chorizo allows you to imagine you're not totally off your Southbeach diet. It's very cheesy and delicious!!
The Barcelona is also delicious. 
The Ham and cheese was a little tame for my dinner companion, but I would not have expected this to be overwhelming in flavor. 
Also, the martinis are FANTABULOUS!!!! Very strong, just like I like them."}

I went to Krazy Mac's because I love cheese. I FRICKING LOVE CHEESE!
On initial entry I was shocked to find the decor was on the \"fancy\" side, but that didn't really matter. It was just unexpected for a Mac & Cheese joint.

The bread that came with the dinner was fantastic. The service was kind and helpful. The dish I got was OK. In defense, my husband got a different dish and said his was better than mine, but I didn't try his...

There are all kinds of specials on the menu, I got the Mexican themed dish. So maybe this particular one wasn't the crown jewel. But I have talked to a few friends that went to Krazy Mac's and they all kinda agreed that it wasn't the \"best\" dish they had had.

THAT BEING SAID...

I loved the space. It's good food. It's good service. It's an essential visit. I would tell anyone to go and try it out because it was VERY FAR from bad. Maybe next time I'm in the neighborhood I will try something more basic."}
{"text":"Krazy Mac's is a clever concept and I think its well executed for the most part.  I will agree with one of the other reviews I read, the bread is excellent, as well as the salad that comes with any of the mac and cheeses.I've had the buffalo mac twice (Buffalo Chicken and Blue Cheese) and the black forest mac (Wild Mushrooms and Gouda Cheese).  The buffalo mac is good, but its extremely rich so be mindful of that when you order.  Then again how many of them are honestly not going to be a little rich considering they are made with real cheese?  Anyways, the Black Forest I thought was the better of the two though.  More taste and less overpowering.  The only problem with the place is they need to offer whole grain/whole wheat noodles or something.  This would help to at least reduce the carb overload from all the cheese and noodles you eat.  I highly recommend eating maybe half of the portion or else I do guarantee you will feel sluggish."}
