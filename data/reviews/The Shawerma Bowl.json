{"text":"They bake fresh pitas to order and that makes all of the difference. The wonderfully soft and chewy pita combined with the juicy shawarma chicken had me squealing with delight. They mix their chicken with cooked onions and that added an extra boost of flavour.

The shawarma wraps are smaller than your average shawarma place, but I found the size to be perfect for me. I usually have trouble finishing an entire wrap. So this one would probably be a bit small for bigger eaters. 

The place itself and was pretty busy when I was there around 9pm on a Friday, so we had to wait a bit longer for our food. But that's encouraging to see it's popular among people in the know."}
{"text":"The guy working here was wearing a \"burger factory\" tshirt but the place is called shawarma bowl...
When you walk inside it's extremely narrow and has an unwelcoming feeling. My fiancé told me not to judge the inside that the food is the \"best shawarma he has ever had\" and that we will take it to go and eat at home.

We order a chicken and a beef shawarma to go.
The tables were so close to where the guy was preparing the food we could hardly fit and go to where he was putting the toppings on our sandwich! 
I don't know who came up with this deign but it's got to be illegal. The hallway is so narrow you wouldn't be able to bring a wheel chair or stroller down it. 
Still trying to stay positive we decided to also add an order of falafel. 

We get home, open the sandwiches and chow down. 
They're very stuffed and huge! Great portions! 
I did not like the taste. Mine tasted a bit sour like something had gone bad. The chicken didn't have flavour. I felt a little sick after eating half of mine. 
My fiancé loved his.. 
I decide to have some falafel with hummus and I open the hummus and it looks like it's gone bad. Has a strange smell. I bite into the falafel and OMG I SPIT IT OUT! This was not falafel. From the outside looked like it but the inside was green and tasted like salad gone bad. 
NO THANKS! 

I think they must be slow because the food was not fresh and tasted horrible!!"}
{"text":"New Shawerma junction is Open. They have bake their own pita . Always fresh pita . They have a unique Shawerma.  They have created Bowl! Instead just warp, we have choose with bowl. Nice touch !
Unfortunately they need to put more spice. The food is bland. They still need to update their spice."}
