{"text":"I came here to study. Thinking a library would be peaceful & quiet enough to concentrate. This library is rather unique..... out of all the people in here (mind you school just got out so there's a ton of kids) the ONLY people that are talking aloud (going on 20min straight now) are the damn librarians!!!!! Seriously guys? There's 2 up front just flapping away like a normal convo at a loud restraunt and 1 guy who keeps coming in and out of a door that leads to the back and letting it SLAM every time he passes through it. 
I expect this stuff from I'll behaved small children but for the librarians ?!?!??"}
{"text":"This is a decent library although a tad noisy. What library isn't noisy these days? In an ideal world they would expand their entrepreneurial section as that is becoming a key hub of influence in many communities"}
{"text":"Great book selection on business and personal development, respectful staff, and the perfect combination of being able to talk to people and enjoy silence. I focus very well every time I'm here."}
{"text":"We come here after school often to do homework. It's a great library for kids! They have stuff to play with and many children's books to look at!! But if you are looking for a quiet place, this is not one for you! Great for families with younger children, but if noise and jumpy kids are an issue for you, might try a different location! We love it!"}
{"text":"A very nice and new appearance. My first time visiting and I think it's too noisy for a library. I recommend a separate facility for the children. The younger children should have a separate place (a children's library). This place sounds like a nursery or a playground or the lunchroom at school. I was rather disappointed. The Sunset Chandler Library is much more peaceful and quiet if you do not like noise distractions."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful community library that has something going on every week. From story times for babies, toddlers and preschoolers, to technology classes, and more! The best part, it's all FREE. 

To get a library card all you need is a current ID with your address. That's it. But you don't need a library card to go to the programs or even go in. They have awesome study areas where you can plug in and do homework or study. The wifi is free and no passcode required. They have 8 public computers and even some for kids. Also a Free scanner one can use! This place is the best! :-) 

Now on to the staff. They are friendly and very helpful! I can attest to that because I have been here over the past year. I love coming here and meeting others in the community. Don't miss out on all the wonders that this library offers! 

If you prefer to stay at home, they also have a free online streaming service like Netflix called Hoopla. Free with your library card! Also you can download free music, magazines, and audiobooks. There's something for everyone. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"This is a great branch Library. Very new and clean. My favorite part about the Maricopa Libraries is their online catalog. When you go online to www.mcldaz.org you will have access to the entire county's  inventory of movies and books. I like to go online and request movies and books for pickup. I get an email when they are ready. Then all I need to do is go and pick them up. 

They have a great selection in their building everyday. And I appreciate a section called Friends of the Library where books are for sale for $0.50-1.00."}
