{"text":"Very good decor! Server was nice! Place was busy do to Mother's Day  I had the fish and chips shore the fish was not fresh fried looked frozen tasted frozen. My wife had the beef brisket tasted ok but looked like mush on a plate not Good. They forgot my vinegar. They forgot the Mac cheese. The cole slaw was way to wet I almost choked on it gggggaggggg Had three people that were involved in my table not good. Way to much money for the quality of food 1-10 I give the place a 1 you guys need a lot of work sorry but true. How do I know because I've been a chef for the past 30 years."}
{"text":"Average chain restaurant with the average variety, but still good teriyaki salmon and mac and cheese. There is not much to say."}
{"text":"Wondering where I can use the gift card I've got for Smokey Bones since the one closest to where I live is now closed.  We hadn't used it because our last few visits there were less than stellar food and service but now I guess we're out $25 unless we go east.  Oh well..."}
{"text":"Thought I would stop in for a quick lunch between meetings. Have been to other locations and had a great experience. But today not so much. I sat at the bar, and the bartender was more worried about eating her food at a dining room table rather then attending to her customers at the bar. I came in and knew what I wanted but had to wait to order. Then had to wait to have her close my check out. Disappointed in the service and the lunch was mediocre.  I'll stick to other restaurants when I need a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We were In the area. My boyfriend was craving BBQ and I a margarita. We decided on smoky bones and it was a great decision. The food was delicious, portioned nicely and priced appropriately.  Our server Alyssa was delightful. We were seated in the bar area and the bartender stated she didn't want to take us. So Alyssa swooped in and made the transition seamless and a lot less awkward then it could has been.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Their food is great and honestly we were able to have 5 people eat for about $50 which isn't too bad. The chicken by brother had obviously isn't their specialty. But the burgers were superb. The waitress seemed new and a little distant in the brain. She obviously was still getting used to stuff. The food took a little while to come out which made me demolish my burger even faster. After that everything seemed to go well. I love the fact that you can request to have a channel changed to watch what you want but they need to upgrade their TVs."}
{"text":"BBQ was so so. Ribs were good, brisket a bit tough, smoked wings were amazing. Mashed potatoes were under salted and the baked beans looked and tasted as if they've been around too long. Pretty empty at 6 pm on a Tuesday but it was bad Cleveland weather. Waitstaff seemed to mill about the kitchen door. Our waitress was a little goofy but got the job done. Seems like the typical chain generic bbq spot. Check came before the dessert, apple wontons. Sure did not look like the pic in the menu... But what do you expect for 3 bucks?"}
{"text":"This was a bad experience from the start. The hostes told me that there was a one hour wait (even though the dining room was half empty). Twenty minutes into my wait, two parties came in and were seated while I waited. After complining I was seated.  Ordered a salad and ribs. The salad was good, the ribs were as tough as leather. The baked potato had to be broken with fork and knife since it probably had been baking for hours.  The only good thing about the experience was the server which was very attentive and appologized profusely for the innedible food."}
{"text":"Will never return. Surprised I didn't walk out as soon as I stepped in, but my daughter suggested it, so we stayed. The pictures & trophies of pigs terrified me. Even the people eating there were huge. Yikes. It's a barbecue-type restaurant & well-known for their giant slab of ribs in special bbq sauce.   I ordered shrimp skewers with steamed broccoli from their 600 cal or less menu. Surprisingly, they were tastey, but nowhere near enough to satisfy me.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Ate there today - not bad - a solid Chain restaurant location and food."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Group of six; we were seated and served quickly.  Reasonable prices, great drink scpecials.  Food was fine."}
{"text":"Food was NOT good. Service was NOT good. Nothing about our experience at Smokey Bones was good. Next time we are in the area, we will try to find somewhere else to go. Don't waste a meal here."}
{"text":"A few people inside 4 people in front of me waited about 6 minutes for them to be seated then i waited an extra 14 minutes. Still no-one came so i left if being seated is so difficult i can only imagine how my dining experience would be."}
{"text":"The best cornbread! Great staff and environment. A little pricey but worth it. Plenty of choices. Everything was on point."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place on a Friday night while I was in town for business.  We could have gone to the scores of other restaurants around this area, but decided to try a this place since we don't have one in the area that we live in.  As I was hungry for ribs it sounded like a good place to go.  We were seated pretty much right away since it was after 6 pm.  We ordered cocktails, which mine was extremely weak.  After finally placing our food order, we waited 40 minutes for it to be served.  The waitress was not very interested in the fact that we hadn't been served yet although all her other tables who were seated after us already had their meals.  We asked to speak to the manager who seemed bored by the fact that his customers were still waiting after the length of time.  He offered us another cocktail, but when we refused didn't offer anything else and was not compensated on our bills.  The food was average, but I think I was so hungry I would have eaten anything at that point.  I don't believe that we will be returning unless it's at another location."}
{"text":"I had the stacked baked potato and salad. Menu misrepresented item served. This restaurant has been in death spiral. Do yourself a favor and avoid."}
{"text":"Lunch doesn't seem to be a good time to come to this location.  I chose the bar because it usually has good service - not the case today. Single bartender had to wait tables as well."}
{"text":"Last night me and my fiancee stopped in after a movie we ordered the wings to go they made the order wrong so we had to wait an hr so they could make our food over the bartender told me we would receive a discount because the manager was good with those things his words he goes to talk to her I guess she said just charge us full price so we got no discount waited an hr and they made a mistake and over charged us and had to remove something from our bill not even so much as a 5$ off coupon we were offended but never spoke a word smiled payed our bill and left i even left a tip and this is not the first time that same person messed up our order and we are regulars we might not be back though I doubt they care"}
{"text":"The bar is good, and the decor ok, but I found the ribs way too smoke flavored and over cooked. Pass this one up."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times in the last 6 months ..... And the quality has suffered :(  ribs were the best part of our diner ......  Great smokey flavor .....  Drinks were too strong poor flavor .....  After telling our server that this drink was no good ..... He brushed  it off and brought water , NO refill on the water ....  Garlic steak was too salty and seemed microwaved ???  We decided to order cheesecake bites, one of our favorite desserts ..... Totally disappointed the center was still cold :( .... I'm not one to complain, I am the type of person to not re-visit this establishment.  There are way too many great rib places in this area !  This place wasted my time and dime"}
{"text":"Hard to have a bad experience here. Always order the smoked wings. They're a mix between dry and wet. Slightly sweet but packed with flavor. The bar is always clean, or at least every time I come (once or twice every two months). Decent beer selection. Not huge, but satisfying."}
{"text":"It was like eating at a drive thru only in a booth. We've eaten here before on our yearly cross country drive and liked it enough to return this trip. But it's changed. Fist they have the tablets on each table wher you can order your appetizers, drinks and desserts all on your own. As well as swipe your cc to pay. No interaction with the waitress except to bring your food. We sat, ordered our coronas which came fast. Looked at the menu , ordered our meals which came before our second sip of beer. The food was pre cooked and only tepid warm. Didn't have the heart to order our desserts on the tablet. So swiped CC and left. It felt like fast food at higher prices with very little staff interaction. I was wondering if I was expected to leave a 20% tip for a server I spoke 5 words to once and whose only task was to just dump our food on the table. No need to stop in Mentor next trip thru."}
{"text":"Honestly last time we are at Smokey Bones had to be 4+ years ago. We decided to not go back because our spinach dip appetizer bowl was 1/4 full when we received it and we asked the person that brought it if it shouldn't have more in it, she said no looks like a correct serving. We thought overpriced for their food and just not worth what you get, etc...   Memorial Day this year I take my brother, so just the two of us. Food was okay, again, their food or at least what we get isn't worth what you pay for food. Seems almost always over priced for small portions. Our food was okay, nothing special, however I thought almost $3.00 for an ice tea was a bit much, thought I ,now free refills, etc.. Ice te costs pennies compared to soda, but okay. I order my Dad 2 piece BBQ chicken to go with sweet potato. I guess I should have checked it at the restaurant, my dad loves sweet potatoes, he is 80 yrs old. When we got to my dads, I opened the container and thought everything was packaged nicely, the sweet potato was literally slightly larger than a TATER TOT. My dad looked and looked and could t believe they could even grow sweet potatoes to be that small....   So I guess Smokey Bones is off the list. Not the best place to go, for almost a $60.00 meal really not worth it... Simply my two cents, and I haven't missed anything not going for all these years. There are WAY BETTER places out there, where the quality and price are in check with each other."}
{"text":"Ordered the Hawaiian ribeye medium and it came VERY rare. Our server was MIA for 10 minutes so I just ate the sides and told her to take it off when she finally came. Will not return."}
{"text":"I went in hesitant as I have a very restrictive diet that doesn't allow me to eat out much. My family wanted to go so I agreed assuming I would just eat when I got home. The bartender, Megan Shannon, was AMAZING! She was able to help me navigate the menu and communicate with the kitchen for my dietary needs before I placed my order. The food was delicious, the drinks were amazing, and Megan made my experience one I won't forget. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We are there about a week ago. Food was okay. Service not so much. The last few times we have been there, the experience was below average,  the place is dirty. Not in a hurry to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Two stars may be generous.  The cornbread is pretty good.  Last time I was there I got the brisket that they said was smoked for over 4 hours.  I should have known better.  Good brisket takes 10 hours or more to smoke properly.  They slice it thin so you don't notice that it is chewy.  I think there are lots of other places that are better if you are looking for good barbecue."}
{"text":"Have you ever gone eight hours without eating - totally looking forward to an awesome meal to satify your hunger?  Well Smokey Bones is not that place.    The food was absolute crap. I take that back. I suspect crap tastes better than the food here.  Service was crap also. I had to get my own set of utensils and napkins.   On my bill, I drew a middle finger instead of leaving my signature on it."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time ever here. .we decided to have a birthday dinner for my boyfriend...Not only did we have to wait a extra 40 mins for a table because they don't have many tables to accommodate larger parties...but we did not receive  our food for 1 hour 50 minutes later...we asked our server several times about our meals around 40 mins  of not getting them...1hr passed and talked to 2 different female mangers. ..we got so many different stories as why still no dinner...finally after we got our food, we got the right reason..which was our server forgot to  put our order in..you would think our food would be hot and appealing to eat...I had a burger which was charcoal both sides ordered it medium....ordered chicken tenders for kids and they were raw...this is the most disorganized restaurant I've ever been to. ..after all this they took $40 off a $110.00 check...very unprofessional....will not be back here at all"}
{"text":"I am still a fan of smokey bones.. love the spacious seating and square large bar.  New bar stools now at this bar... cool red color.   Instead of ribs we tried the cuban sandwich this time..  yes it was good but the portion size lacked. I don't expect the sandwich to be monstrous but we were both still hungry after the sandwich and a side.      The service was on average.  A young man came to the table and couldn't answer any of our questions - said he was new. Then a different  woman came and couldn't answer them either.   I know not every visit is spot on ..  but this type of visit you do remember."}
{"text":"Intended to eat at Bahamas Breeze but turned around and went to Smokey Bones due the wonderful smell that was permeating the air from the BBQ grill. I went there with my Supervisor to catch up and decompress from a busy mid-work week. . The atmosphere was great for conversation. Our server was really friendly and attentive to our needs. I created my own combo ordering the spicy sausage, brisket, mashed potatoes with gravy and cole slaw. Menu price was $15. The meat was very flavor and cooked just right. The sausage was good but I was expecting something a little more unique. Overall I had a great dinning experience ! They brought fresh homemade sugar coated donuts with chocolate and grape dipping sauce after our meal(complimentary). I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Started off with a really good mohito. I got the three meat combo platter. Pulled pork, top notch. Smoked wings, very good though a tad salty. Brisket, average and a little fatty. Excellent BBQ baked beans and no complaints about the fries. A little pricey for BBQ but very good."}
{"text":"i agree w/the recent reviews, haven't been there in a while for that reason but nice to see they're still pumpin' out the same low quality food w/the same indifferent service...HOW this place is still in business is beyond me, especially w/all the great BARBQ places/meat places in town"}
{"text":"Went here for a work party. The food was decent. I had the mac and cheese. It was really dry. It had no sauce to sit in. The noodles were a little too under cooked. I was not a fan. If you want good mac and cheese go to Willoughby Brew Co.  My biggest issue was the bartender. I waited literally 25 minutes for her to finally approach me to make a drink. When she did acknowledge me instead of a, \"what can I get you?\" or \"can I help you?\" I literally got, \"What do you want?\" Sorrryyyy to bother you but I'd like a drink. I've been perfectly patient. She had to look everything up in the book to make it and I felt like I was bothering her for asking.  Desert was interesting but good. We got the cheesecake bites. I was expecting them cold but they were hot and friend. It was like an explosion of warm sweetness in my mouth. It was delicious and came with a superb fruit dip. So good. Can't say I'd go back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"While it may not win awards for the very best BBQ around, our family had a great experience at this restaurant.  The BBQ was very good, loved the wings wings with their Memphis sauce, and the vegetable sides were as good as we've had at much more expensive restaurants.  Service was good, just a very pleasant eating experience for a family of six from Az."}
{"text":"Live this place really miss eating here since we have moved to Florida. The service is great and the food is amazing. Pulled pork and brisket are my favorites."}
{"text":"I used to love Smokey Bones when I lived in Orlando.  It was someplace you could go to and just relax, unwind, and be yourself (other than my favorite, the Ale House).  Plus, the mountain cabin feeling inside made it seem more homey.  This one in the University area has that same look, but for some reason doesn't capture the same ambiance and provide me with that \"feeling.\"  I tried my favorite dish on their menu (the buffalo burger, made from real buffalo), but it didn't taste as good as the Orlando ones.  (Maybe they grow their buffaloes differently in Florida? Ha!)  Anyway, I think the company's doing an overall of their restaurants, so don't count Smokey Bones out.  They have a lot of campfire favorites:  BBQ, ribs, burgers, smoked chicken, steaks, etc.  The ambiance is enjoyable with the cabin feel, and if you're never tried buffalo, you have to try the buffalo burger.  It's almost like a hamburger, but better in my opinion (and better for you!)."}
{"text":"Dashon was our waiter and he was very attentive to our needs! My wife ordered the brisket sandwich and I ordered the Texas style brisket which was to die for. Portions could be larger though. Nice place for a gathering!"}
{"text":"We waited almost an hour and a half for our food and most of the orders were wrong. They brought one of the drinks out in a dirty glass...literally there was scum in the glass. The bathroom was filthy. The staff became a litttle too \"familiar\"... ie one of the waitresses said with a swerve of her neck, \"Girl,don't make me come over there\". Really?! I was also told by our waitress that she'd gotten the bartender to add another shot and that I should be grateful. Wooow..."}
{"text":"What a fantastic BBQ place!   We went for the ribs and they were delicious!  Carlo, our bartender/waiter was AMAZING and kept the drinks flowing all night.  Definitely worth stopping in! We will be back the next time we're in Robinson!"}
{"text":"Stoped in Saturday for dinner. My Soninlaw had never been. Always good food and service. The reason for this comment today is for the little quirk I saw on the menu. If you order a 22oz bones brew, it will cost you more per ounce than a pint. No volume discount with this one. When I brought it to my servers attention he made the gesture to make it better. 22 oz at pint price. We all enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food, specialty Mac & Cheese entrees and the coolest waitress in Pittsburgh (Michell) excellent service!"}
{"text":"on our way to and from Holiday Valley we try to stop in.  Its a simple place for good, family, BBQ.  I wish they were closer to Hudson but oh well, it makes the visit that much better when we only go once a quarter."}
{"text":"I like this location!  It's decent food, service is good and they have a decent beer selection.  I eat here often when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Fifth time here and every time the service is great and the food is amazing. I can watch the game or have a quit meal. Good job and thanks."}
{"text":"Great tasting BBQ for a chain, join the club for regular discounts. I am a sucker for their smoked wings.  The only caveat is be early because they can get a little crowded. Try each of the sauces I like them all for different reasons. Don't forget the fresh donuts for dessert too!"}
{"text":"Food is average, atmosphere is nice, service is poor, brisket is good and I like the choices in BBQ sauce. Prices aren't too bad;   brisket and two sides is $12, burgers about $9."}
{"text":"Well well well.....we've been wanting to try this place for a while. We had a night open and decided to try it out.   Came in about 7 and the place was empty. Hmmm?   Seated next to the bar and I noticed a sign for $3.99 craft beer special. Asked the server and she wasn't sure. She had to check and it turned out it was a bottle of Fat Tire. Not too bad of a price I guess.  When I ordered brisket, appropriate for a BBQ joint, they were out of it! Very inappropriate for a BBQ joint. I decided to go with baby back ribs instead. They came back and said they had enough brisket for a side with my ribs... For $3 more! Couldn't I just have that for free since I originally wanted it?  We ordered a kids meal for our son. Mac and cheese with broccoli. The portion was tiny for $6.  Ribs came and they were not very extravagant at all. For a place that prides itself on BBQ, this was way below par. I'd expect this presentation from an Applebee's or chilis, but not this place.  They were still flavorful, but the fries were probably the highlight. Coleslaw had a weird  taste.  I'd be ok not coming here again."}
{"text":"Haven't been there in a few years and now I know why. My son's portion was quite small for the price. My food was either cold or warm. Server just ok. Manager was great. Not happy once again."}
{"text":"This review is for take out only.  We had a big family gathering in the area and one of my relatives is a big fan of Smokey Bones (I had never heard of it before).  So, upon his recommendation, we placed a large order for take out.    They did a great job providing everything we needed for our family reunion (including plates, napkins, cups, wipe-ups, forks, extra sauce, etc).  And the order was ready when we got there to pick it up.   We had a huge platter of some sort of pork (which of course I don't partake in) and a huge platter of BBQ chicken, various side dishes including slaw, baked beans, rolls, and a couple of gallons of tea.   I can't say what the service is like for dining in, but for take-out if you are feeding a pretty good sized crowd, I would say give them a try!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a family reuinion and this place was right by the hotel. We had a party of 7. The service was HORRIBLE. There were only 2 other tables occupied but it took a century to get our food. Then 6 out of 7 of us had incorrect orders. Our waitress noted that they had mixed up several plates btu instead of offering to fic it assumed that we would just all trade portions of our plates to make a correct plate. UH NO! All of our baked potatoes were hard and cold. It was a mess. Then when the bill came the waitress didn't even acknowledge the poor service with an adjustment on the bill or even an i'm sorry.  I had to ask for the manager and explain the entire debaucle to get any attention. In the end, the manager knocked 50% off the bill so I give him kudos for that. But thats about it."}
{"text":"Went last night with my wife and for starters they ran out of there signature beer.... I should have new something was up when I heard the server tell the table next to our that they were closing.... Had the combo baby back ribs and and smoked wing.... Wings were dry and had zero flavor and the rib were ice cold..... Will never go back... Well I can't cuz I guess this location is closing.... $60 wasted in my mind"}
{"text":"An all around great disappointment. Decent and quick service is the only reason why this rating is not lower. I ordered a Brisket Sandwich the quality of the meat was quite low a lot more fat and grissle than I would expect. As to the flavor of the meat... I couldn't tell... it was drowning in mayo and cheese. This might be expected at a seafood place or a burger place but with a name like Smokey Bones... I would assume that smoked meat would be thier speciality... very subpar and disappointing."}
{"text":"We went this past Saturday night for dinner.  Let me tell you, it was the ABSOLUTE WORST dining experience of my life.  For starters, our waitress, Sam P, was absolutely TERRIBLE.  She was rude, unattentive, and actually started talking about us to other customers.  To top it off, as we were leaving, she body checked one of the girls in our party RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MANAGER!!  However, I digress.  After waiting for 45 minutes for an iced tea, our meals FINALLY came.  Mind you, our meals Finally came, but we STILL didnt have half of our drinks, our salads, or soup!  my husband gets his meal and is told \"we ran out of brisket, so we put some pulled pork on your plate\", my friend got her steak (that was still almost \"mooing\"), and she asked for it to be cooked a bit more, and my daughter couldn't get the pasta, because \"they were out of cheese!!\"  So, now we had to wait for ANOTHER round of food.  Then we were told \"the ran out of steak\".  Mind you, STILL don't have the salad, soup OR the tea!!!  We asked for the manager, Sam P rolled her eyes and reluctantly went and got him.  he was incredibly apologetic, got us a new server, and took care of our entire bill.  Thanks for handling the situation, however, the waitress and her funky attitude was not dimsissed, and she continued to bad mouth our tble to the other staff and clientele!  it was a horrible evening out, which ended with the crazy waitress body checking my friend on the way out.  i wanted to say something to her directly, but she looked like she would be the type to start a fight, and it was just not worth it."}
{"text":"Good food and decent pricing makes this an alternative to the other \"chain\" options in the Robinson area outside of Pittsburgh.  The service was helpful and professional.  The food came out relatively fast (it was a busy night) and it all tasted great."}
{"text":"Good things to get here: THE CORNBREAD, Brunswick stew, and the broccoli side.  The $6 cornbread appetizer is like cake. It is so amazing that my coworker who doesn't like cornbread said it was the best cornbread she's ever had. The butter they serve with it - divine. I'm sure I overindulged in carbs due to this appetizer but I didn't care. I want to go back just for this cornbread, no kidding.  I got the pulled pork platter with the brunwsich stew and while the pulled pork was so-so, the brunswick stew was really good and I also liked my side of broccoli - it was cooked just right and I felt like I was eating somewhat healthy (although, after eating the whole cornbread appetizer, I probably wasn't).   This place is really cute decor wise (the booths look like they've made of wooden logs) and is a good low-key place to bring the kids. I would encourage going here over those boardwalk restaurants also near the Hilton University Center. Price point is perfect too."}
{"text":"Smokey Bones:  This is a great place that serves solid barbeque ribs and chicken.  I went here a couple of times when I was an undergrad.  The great thing about this place is that you can have a half chicken paired up with a half slab of ribs.  Remember chicken AND beef is always better than chicken OR beef.  One time I was at this place with my girlfriend at the time.  We were having a nice meal in a booth.  This guy comes by, sits right next to my girlfriend, and starts talking to her.  I just blinked a couple of times, not believing what I was seeing.  Before she could tell me that this guy was a friend from work, I told this guy that I was on a date and I'd be damned if I was going to be dining while looking at his ugly mug, so make like the wind and blow.  This guy leaves and cue the waterworks.  My woman was bawling.  Turns out what I thought was chivalry ruined the evening.  Live and learn people...live and learn."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE.  REALLY HORRIBLE.  The only reason I gave this place 1 star, is because it wouldn't let me give it a ZERO rating.  As a food lover and as a BBQ lover this place deeply saddens me.  It saddens me because it has the potential to be a really great establishment.  I say this because the facilities at Smokey Bones are well-above decent.  There is plenty of parking.  The inside of the restaurant is spacious and includes a nice, roomy bar as well.  There are plenty of TVs draped throughout the restaurant.  Their screen setup could be awesome, except they aren't HD.  They are the big box TVs from the early 90s.  In addition there is a speaker at every booth which allow you to listen to the TV of your choice.     Without wasting too much time on this place - I ordered the the half-rack of ribs.  Though they looked (see pics) and smelled great, THEY WERE THE MOST DREADFUL RIBS I've ever had.  ANYWHERE.  The ribs tasted as if they had been cooked the night before, thrown in the cooler over night and then taken out and reheated and served to me for lunch.   This place shouldn't be allowed to serve ribs or even call itself a BBQ restaurant.   DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!  Try McDonald's or Boardwalk Billies both nearby, instead.  In the words of the famed Randy Moss, \"I wouldn't feed that sh*t to my dawg!!!\""}
{"text":"Their pulled pork is to die for. They also have some nice burger platters that are very filling. The bar is good to hang out at and they have several TVs that are easy to see no matter where you sit."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing, the customer service, the food quality and flavors. I would definitely recommend going here (I went to the Robinson location), it's a pretty big restaurant and a great overall experience! I had the smokehouse chicken with broccoli and a loaded baked potato, price wasn't bad either!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to visit Smokey Bones this week. I had the rib & chicken (White Meat- they were out of dark meat) combo. It was actually pretty good. However the worst part of this dining experience was the host who was suppose to great us when we came through the door. He started off by saying \"just 2\". As though 2 people was not enough. Well, I can appreciate some good hospitality and a welcoming personality before patronizing a restaurant that I don't frequent very often."}
{"text":"The only thing that saved this place for me was the chicken wings.  They are spot on.  Crispy, great flavor, good size.  I'd recommend the wings.  The rest...not so much.  This place seems like it's over priced for the quality you get. I paid $4 for a side of Mac n cheese that was just okay.  We also had the pretzel bones appetizer.  The pretzels tasted like the microwaved pretzel you get from the Walmart snack bar, with a side of cheap canned cheese.  I just was not a fan, at all.  I'd come back, but only for the wings."}
{"text":"There's a reason it's 6:30 and no ones here! Bathroom was my first stop. Floors are so sticky in bathroom my shoe almost fell off!  Good was good. Beans and pulled pork what I expected. Garlic bread. I know it might be classic but when it's so gross you can't eat it, just quit serving it and serve corn bread. This is where I love Famous Dave's- CORN BREAD!!  Portion sizes were great, got pork and chicken fingers and split w my daughter and we had more than enough.   The bottles on the table were so sticky I felt gross every time I grabbed them. Food was good but everything was over all kind of dirty which makes me wonder."}
{"text":"I often meet people here for lunch mid-week, since it is easy to get in, service is quick and food always tasty.   I find the loaded baked potato (topped with brisket) and salad combination to be a perfect meal.  I get some of the bbq brisket which I enjoy and can top with one of their four sauces while still not feeling like I've overindulged.  When I do want indulge, their half-pound burgers are great.  The smokehouse bbq burger gets me that same bbq feeling, but with the added plus of some onion straws on top and fries (or other) on the side.  Soft drinks are a bit pricey, so I usually stick to water.  They have a loyalty card program (bones club) that earns you a $20 reward after 200 points, as well as coupons (e.g. $5 off $15) pretty regularly.  Makes you want to go back."}
{"text":"One star is too much for this restaurant.  Horrible meal.  Order the brisket and 25 minutes after our order was taken they said they ran out.  Ordered the sausage asiago mac n cheese and it was lukewarm and too sweet tasting.  My husband could not eat his sandwich it was bad.  Kids meals tasted good but skimpy portions."}
{"text":"My 3 friends went to robinson Smokeys and it was Amazing! One had a huge salad- i had the smoked turkey Cuban style sandwich and my other friend opted burger The food was so good! The fire roasted corn sweet fresh that after hearing about their bag of doughnuts I ordered that and coffee Oh my Gosh! Hot fresh old fashioned doughnut w choc or rasp dip sauce! I should of ordered a bag to go home! The waitress said people come in just for the doughnuts! No wonder!mmm! I had 2 left and I got home made coffee and enjoyed them. Great lunch great price & doughnuts to die for!!"}
{"text":"i haven't even got my food yet and this has been the worst service i've ever experienced in my life.    do not come here. i repeat do not come here!"}
{"text":"Can't remember what it was called, but it came out on this little grill and included wings, chicken, steak, sausage, ribs, peppers.  Was very good, especially the wings."}
{"text":"My BBQ chicken was dry and the Waitress replaced it qith another one. The potato was white and fluffy, Broccoli was perfect.."}
{"text":"Purportedly a BBQ place, but I wouldn't come here for that. Brisket is indeed dry; it wasn't like that when I first tried this place a few years ago. 2.5 stars if judged solely on the menu.   Smokey Bones is more like a great place to drink and watch sports on any number of televisions that are all over the place. And suck on their succulent smoked chicken wings. So good, enough to jack it up to 3 maybe 3.5 stars.   The service was very good, helpful and quite attractive. Some of the best looking waitstaff I've seen outside of a Hooters; adding an extra point for that reason. Because I'm shallow like that."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience. Food was as always amazing steaks and burgers always came out as ordered. Very good customer service!"}
{"text":"I went here about 10 times when I lived in Pittsburgh.  Believe me here in Connecticut there is nowhere to get barbecue.  There was one Smokey Bones in our area and it closed up.  It was awful and should have closed, lol.  I remember this location well and miss it soooooo much!  A full rack of ribs every time, good drinks, awesome service, enjoyable bar area also.  I heard they don't serve the Texas style garlic bread automatically with your meal anymore, otherwise I'd give 5 stars."}
{"text":"It was my first time and last. Had a coupon was the reason to try this place. Should of known as only one other couple in the whole place. Had to wait 10 min.to be seated , the front desk was filthy and dusty.  We ordered the same thing. Barbecue chicken. Awful , it was brought out so fast, probably cooked it early and let it sit in a warming oven. Chicken, dry, potato was cold ,broccoli cold ..told the waitress she never apologized just asked if we wanted something else...Very disappointed. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Glad this chain is not local to my city figured I'd try this place since it was mentioned several times in the past as a place that might come to my city.    Major disappointment. Figured I'd eat light and have soup and salad soup was cold there is no excuse for that.  It literally had ice cold spots in the center of it.   Salad had no tomatoes and was loaded with croutons,  baked potato was the only thing that didn't let me down"}
{"text":"Went here last after not having been here in a few years. It was a Friday a little after 6, and wasn't too crowded. I noticed that they had moved most of the TVs to the bar area and beyond. You used to be able to select which channel you could hear from your table from among the multitude of TVs, but no big loss. If you really want to watch sports, there's plenty of room, and if you really want to have dinner without the distraction, now there's more of a place for you.  I ordered the combo platter of baby back ribs and smoked chicken wings, the ribs with their dry rub, and a side of baked potato and baked beans. My companions split a full slab of the same baby backs, and had a baked sweet potato, baked beans and grilled veggies.  Our orders came in a reasonable amount of time, and everything was pleasantly hot. And have to say, the ribs were perfect! They were just the right char and doneness, and didn't even need sauce, though they offer 4 differing recipes in squeeze bottles on the table. I was surprised at how good the smoked wings were, having never had them before. They were reasonably crispy, maybe a tad dry, but nothing bothersome, and had an excellent flavor. Baked potato was fine, the beans were maybe a bit too sweet, but nothing a squeeze of their mustard sauce couldn't fix.  My companions agreed that the ribs were just right. They thought the marshmallows and pecan butter was a little overkill for the sweet potato, but luckily they ordered it on the side. They also thought that the grilled veggies should not be in the tomatoey sauce they arrived in. When you think of grilled veggies, you think of slightly drier veggies with maybe a smokey flavor.  But the stars here are definitely the meats (sorry Arbys), and they delivered on all accounts. It's a very spacious restaurant, and the service was right on, keeping tabs on the table and drinks filled! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We went here because they were open late after a concert. The service was slow and I almost felt like a burden to the server. We ordered the Philly mac and cheese, burgers, and wings. Everything was bad except the wings. This experience was a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I'd really like to give it 3 stars just for the point but the food was fine, the service sucked though. They're open until 2 am and we were the only table yet we sat many times with empty drinks and no one checking on us. The people I was with loved the tacos and ribs. The chicken fingers are fine, and the fries are good. It's just a mediocre place. The atmosphere is fine, kind of loud."}
{"text":"Wings are absolutely amazing here.  The smoked wings are so darned good, you just can't stop eating them.  Big screens with the Cavs game on, can't beat that.  Their wings even without any sauce on them were delicious.  If you're craving wings you gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"Lunch visit. Restaurant generally clean and well kept. Waitress friendly and attentive. I had 8 smoked wings. Very good , great favor .  Make sure you ask for no sauce if you are Keto , as they do squirt sauce on them before they serve them.  Coke products, good.  My only complaint is the wings could have been hotter. I do not know how they could do that without drying them out since BBQ and smoked meats are cooked ahead of time."}
{"text":"Our food was ice cold ( all three meals) and our server only came to the table 3 times total. No silverware, no extra napkins and the service was terrible! We were only 1 of 2 tables in the ENTIRE place, now we see why :-/"}
{"text":"I agree with the other review, it's good if Daves is crowded. I like the sauces better here then at Dave's but Dave's meat wins. I've had the brisket, pulled pork, chicken fingers, fries, cole slaw and baked beans. Is all pretty good. I didn't care for the brisket, way to thin.  My boyfriend loves the create your own burger, but at $1 a topping it can end up being a $20 burger. Overall not bad, not as good as Dave's."}
{"text":"They have late night specials and their loaded fries are the bomb!!!   I got ribs with smoked wings and there was a lot to eat! The rib wasn't really fall off the bone but it was tasty and tender! The smoked wings were juicy and were piping hot!!  The dining area was huge and on a weekday night at 10pm, it was peaceful and quiet. Or waiter was attentive and refilled our drinks quickly"}
{"text":"I took advantage of the Sunday beer specials and had the nachos for dinner.  Service was very good and the food was delicious.  It's a good place to eat... and very close to the Hilton which is walking distance away."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a work associate and we both had the Pulled pork sandwich.  Unfortunately, I ordered the Mac 'n' Cheese, which I was told by the lovely waitress, that it was delicious!  Well, the sandwich came and was okay, but after taking one bite of the Mac 'n' Cheese, I couldn't believe what I was tasting:  this had more garlic in it than a 5 lb loaf of garlic bread!  I immediately complained that there's no way that anybody who deals with people could eat this and still have friends after!  The waitress agreed but said that \"this is a recipe that came from  Management and there's no changing it!\"    The Chef even came out and said the same thing, which makes me think that not only is the Mgt. of this place \"out to lunch\" (hopefully at a different restaurant), but that they're also tone-deaf and \"hard of tasting!\"  What are these \"Management people\" thinking?  Don't they realize that #1) Mac 'n' Cheese doesn't need any garlic, and #2) that people come here for lunch and need to get back to work, and there's no way that this amount of garlic is going to be a good thing for the person that eats it!   I'm certain there's got to be better BBQ places in N. Charlotte, and I look forward to finding them the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Here on a Monday night. I sat at the bar. I ate the baby back ribs. They were very good. They were slightly over cooked as they fell off the bone, but they were not dry. Baked potato was as it should be. Otherwise the side taste pre made, including the precut garlic toast. All in all, good bbq option for Pittsburgh. Bar staff was spot on, the rest of the wait staff seemed a bit out of focus. Although they only had about 15 tables filled right now. Kind of busy looking and discussing the employee message board, which oddly enough is on a service floor wall.   Food and bar staff gets them the four stars."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food at Smokey Bones especially the pulled pork. This time I was not too impressed with my pulled pork, it was overly greasy and just bland. The service was also pretty terrible for a busy Saturday night. Thy had one waiter and one runner for the whole dining area we were in. That normally would not be a problem but there were at least 20 tables with 6 or more guests. The waiter was just too busy to focus on good customer service. It defintely was not his fault but the managers who did not see this as a problem."}
{"text":"I generally like the kind of food that Smokey Bones has to offer.  I have reviewed them previously for another location, so I wont go into too much detail.  BATHROOMS:  dirty The bathroom at this location on 4/2/11 @ approx 6pm was a trainwreck.  Paper everywhere and one of the sinks didn't even work because the faucet was so broken that it was rotated all the way back and was facing the mirror!  THE WAIT:  long (but it was a Saturday) They *told* us 20-25 minutes and we waited a total of 45 minutes.  FAIL.  THE SERVICE:  bad We waited so long at our seats to be greeted by our server that another male server came over to check on us because we hadn't had drinks yet and were there for a while! Our waitress had ZERO personality and didn't want to be working at all. She was a b!tch, to be quite blunt. She wouldn't make eye contact with myself or my husband and we're very friendly and make it very easy to be waited on.    **Another point to be made about the servers... Dear Management @ Smokey Bones,  Please tell your servers to wear belts and that an inch and a half of ass crack hanging out of the backs of the girls' pants is not appropriate in the food service industry.  This is a restaurant, not a club.  I have sanitary concerns when I'm watching you stick your thumb into your pants to hike them up and then that same thumb is over the edge of a plate with food on it.   FOUL.  FOOD TIMING:  quick!  Someone else delivered our food though, both the appetizer and the entrees and thank god bc of the above mentioned issue with cleanliness concerns of our waitress.  THE FOOD:  is pretty consistently good! Appetizers:  BBQ Chicken Nachos and Smoked Wings, both were fantastic. Dinner:  Pulled Pork and the newer Pork Tenderloin with Teriyaki sauce. Again, both were very good. Refills and Pre-Bus?  These were the only two things that our server did right.   WILL WE BE BACK?   Maybe, but this particular Smokey Bones is not going to be a destination location. The next time we're in Robinson, we'll just go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"It was so nice as a gluten free diner to have so many delicious options! There had to have been roughy 20 entrees to choose from as well as a decent list of gluten free sides and tips on what BBQ sauces were safe.  I ordered the 1/2 BBQ chicken with loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli. My server, Dustin, was fabulous, even noting aloud \"no garlic bread\" after seeing me order and ask a few questions about the menu. Clearly, servers are well-trained. When my meal arrived, however, there was garlic bread on the plate, so Dustin immediately pointed this out, apologized, and said he would fix it. My new plate came within minutes and was fine. I did not get sick.   Overall, I had a great experience. Mistakes happen; mine was corrected, and the wonderful service made up for the small mistake."}
{"text":"Why do I waste my money at places like this? After a trip from Cleveland to Ikea--to purchase a couple 'kids furniture storage items'--the family was desperately hungry. We were trapped in the middle of a bunch of power centers and a mall. There may have been a decent restaurant somewhere nearby, but we wouldn't have known. The idea of going to Chipotle--again--was giving me very dark thoughts.  So we tried this place. Oh, why do I let myself forget what experience has told me over and over and over again: these chain restaurants all taste the same. Butter, fat and salt. Bar-B-Q? Yeah, I tasted some of that. But I had to keep reminding myself that I was at a BBQ place and not an Applebees or Fridays or Bahama Breeze or Outback or whatever. They're all the same; they all use the same cooking techniques, they all have similar menu items with a few 'special' dishes thrown in for variety. I think we're approaching chain restaurant singularity.   A couple times a year we give a chain a chance--with a gift card to redeem, or caught in desperation after a shopping trip. Every time, I leave feeling that I may as well have set fire to the money I just spent. Please friends, help me remember to plan more carefully next time."}
{"text":"I took a group of 20 here for lunch. After ordering, we waited 1 hr 20 min only to be told our waitress had forgotten to put our order into the computer system."}
{"text":"Went on Monday 2-17-14 with the family. Service was good because we went at 5pm or so. Server seemed busy even though there was really no one there. Kids loved there food, and ate very well. Wife loved her BBQ chicken too.   I got the Ribs and Brisket, loved the Brisket, and the ribs really hard and overcooked, tasted like they sat around for a little while. But they did replace them no questions asked. The next ones were much better, and fresher too.   We loved our Food, and service may get a 4 out of 5. Could have made a few more trips to see us. We had to flag him down a few times.  This not as good as Famous Daves, Prices are high."}
{"text":"Outside of the annual Rib Fest, I've never had much luck finding good BBQ food in the area so maybe thats why I like it here. Their pulled pork sandwich is pretty good and they have a variety of sauces to try. Also, their baked beans are delicious.  Now for the negative: This place is never over-crowded and they seem well staffed, but every time we visit we end up waiting forever for our food. This isn't normally something I get upset about but it happens every time we come here."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! My husband works up in Robinson & I visit him often; on one of my visits we both were craving BBQ & we made the right choice. Anytime I'm up there & we want good BBQ we always make a stop here!!"}
{"text":"Came here because I wanted to try something new for dinner with my folks. Since it was near school and I didn't want to drive across the city to eat, we decided to come here. There is plenty of seating, as this place doesn't get that much business (I wonder why...) and the cool thing about the seating is that for every game on the television there is a small box that can tune in so you can hear it. However, it didn't work at my table because either they didn't turn on the system or it was broken.   Let me say, this place is not somewhere to eat. It's a drinking place. That being said, I ordered the BBQ burger and it was stacked (which isn't bad). However, there's a catch to it. You would imagine, yeah burger comes with fries right? Wrong. Fries are a dollar extra on top of your $8-9 burger ($2 if you want onion rings) So, if you decide to get a burger, prepare that there will not be any sides. However, I believe that their burger is something to get and actually more than their BBQ.   My family enjoyed what they ordered, baked potato with a salad and smokehouse burgers. I don't think they had really anything special about it, except that they said it wasn't as oily as other restaurants. (But come on, it's supposed to be greasy!)  Thanks to those who reviewed here on yelp, my family and I stayed away from the brisket! And plus, I think no where can compare briskets to Mac's (check out my review on them). Until then, I'll be sure to mention it. I think my next trip for BBQ will be Mac's, but if you're in the Hilton and you're starving for BBQ you really have no other choice. Hey, at least you can walk."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. We went for a snack at the bar. I ordered the pulled chicken chopped salad and cannot say enough BAD about it. First of all, it was supposed to have candied pecans, avocado, artichoke, corn meat and greens.   The good:  The salad had some lettuce in it! (though old and soggy). There were a few thin-sliced cucumbers that were also soggy. Some chopped meat that was just OK.  The bad: The pecans and avocado were completely missing. The artichoke was barely there, like if I measured, maybe a 1/2 teaspoon or less. When I mentioned it to the bartender, he went back and I could hear the interaction, which was some guy in the kitchen who didn't seem convinced it was true, and I could clearly hear the bartender say \"that's what SHE said\" with an arm motion back to me, and in a tone that implied I  was lying.   Setting aside my impression of that interaction, I waited and waited for them to bring the missing ingredients. The guy from the kitchen eventually threw the little container of pecans onto where the servers pick up in a passive-aggressive way... and i waited and waited some more for both the avocado and the pecans, which I guess remained where they were thrown.   Eventually I said I didn't want the stupid salad.   This place has gone terribly down-hill. We used to like it, but now they can all just hang around pretending like their diminishing customer base is lying about how bad they suck.   Never again."}
{"text":"Tried this place when they first came to Mentor and found it to be mediocre at best.  Tried take-out a couple years later and felt the quality of the product had not changed.  On a whim and because it's years later, thought we'd try take-out again and it's stunning how bad it was.  Ribs and wings were burnt black....you could get better bbq at Denny's.  Fried pickle appetizer had most pieces glued together, with watered down ranch dressing.  I know now why Mentor never gets the better chain restaurants.....no discernible palates.  If there were, this place wouldn't still be in business.  The strangest thing, though, my wife ordered fish and said it, in fact, was good.  Go figure......"}
{"text":"When I first came in, I was amazed at how inexpensive their drinks were. Once I laid eyes on my lunch I understood why. (If you're drunk you can't really taste the food!)   I ordered the smokehouse chicken with a baked potato. Not only did my sad little potato look deflated but my chicken appeared depressed as well - Bland and overcooked.   If I do ever come back here, it would be solely for the beer pong tournaments they have on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Smoked Wings are the way to go...  This is my new Chicken Wing place to go - Forget BW3's and Quaker Steak - get the wings.  The atmosphere makes me feel that I am in AXE Deoderant commercial.  The beer was cold and the wings hot (smoked, grilled taste versus deep fried).  Not much to say - I don't think I will eat the BBQ here.  I have had it before and not a fan.  Atmosphere - Okay - nothing special.     Service - Great - No waiting - recieved my food and beer on time :-)  Cost - $10 - Wings were about $7, Beer $3   I will go back :-)"}
{"text":"For Midwest BBQ, this place is top notch! A few of my friends and I came here to try something different-we were all hankering for a big, juicy burger-and we were not disappointed! They have a good variety of homemade sauces to slather your southern goodness with or dip your fries and the portion to cost ratio was on target! I have been here a couple of times already and have never had bad food or service! As a matter of fact, I couldn't decide between the crab chowder or Brunswick stew-both of which are incredible-and the waitress Jenn brought me a sample of both and upon asking her to surprise me, she brings out two steaming bowls of deliciousness.  The burgers really are quite tasty and a handful,literally! They put B-Spot to shame. Anyway, if you want a good burger or salmon or just a plain, delicious-down south-meal: Smokey Bones is a winner!"}
{"text":"We aren't going back - ever!  We arrived for lunch about 12:15 on Wednesday afternoon.  We were seated promptly but it was 10 minutes before anyone showed up to take our beverage order.  Then 20 minutes for the server to come back to take our order.  It wasn't that busy.  Then we gave our order and I really got angry.  People who had come in after us were getting their meals and the  server was obviously much more interested in serving business people than us.  By the way the business people were all men - ever last one of them.  I was more than ready to leave when our food arrived.  It was good but the prices have really gone up and the size of the servings have gone down.  No way was my 1/3 rack of ribs really 1/3.  Maybe 1/4.  No apology but the server said we have new people in the kitchen and  you know how young people are.  That did it.  We paid our bill and will never go back and will never recommend them to anyone.  There are plenty of other places where we can get better service for less money."}
{"text":"This place is OK, but it is not A-OK, but 3 stars for the very friendly service provided by our waiter, Carlo.  The interior of the restaurant is very cool and kind of cozy, like you are in a cabin full of bbq and there is NOTHING wrong with that.  My friend had the baby back ribs and said they were very good.  I got a hamburger and I do not know how a piece of meat can completely lack flavor.  There was even cheese on it--how was it not good?  I dont know.  I just know that poor cow died in vain for my crummy burger.  :(  :(  Also, avoid the blue bbq sauce...Carolina or Lousinana Mopper or something?  It tasted RANCID.    I'll be back but maybe just for appetizers and drinks.  This would be a good, manly place to watch a sporting event."}
{"text":"In a word, intense. Everything here is maximized, from the nearly ridiculous rustic huge rough hewn logs holding up the front porch, to the incredibly fast service, to the super sweet butter for our cornbread. Even our server was incredibly friendly and fast (drinks came out in almost a minute!)  I had a salad with strawberries, fried chicken tenders, dijon dressing and goat cheese (how deliciously surprising to find goat cheese at a chain restaurant!) and it was lovely. My friend had a burger and baked potato, very good as well and amazingly fast. The menu is just a few pages but everything sounds good, even the donuts for dessert with chocolate and strawberry sauce. Everything had so much flavor, I could only eat a bit of the salad (might get the dressing on the side next time) but it was good.  They also have a large bar, tv's, and a sound system to hear the tv's at your table (though it's hard to position yourself in a place to see them well).  I would definitely come back! I look forward to seeing what they can do with bbq too."}
{"text":"With Smokey Bones and Famous Dave's, Great Northern Mall earns the odd distinction of being an epicenter of chain barbecue restaurants.  Particularly from a not-so-great recent experience at Famous Dave's, the latest round goes to Smokey Bones.  I started with the Brunswick Stew, which I do not recommend.  It was watery and light on the meat.  It had a some spice to it but more resembled chili than actual brunswick stew.  On the other hand, the Baby Back Ribs were pretty good and were better than the tough and not-so-meaty ribs I had the last time I was at Famous Dave's.  The ribs have decent flavoring on their own without additional barbecue sauce.  When I did add sauce, I preferred the KC BBQ sauce which was pretty decent.  The cole slaw and broccoli sides were pretty standard.  Ended the meal with a Bag of Donuts, which are really good, if only because they are brought out incredibly hot.  I'm surprised the waiters don't have blisters from handling those bags.  Served with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces, they are like a poor man's version of the Fresh-N-Hot Doughnut Holes at Red Steakhouse.  (Probably a stretch, but the comparison isn't totally off base.)  So how do you choose between Smokey Bones and Famous Dave's?  If you're in a really carnivorous mood, go to Famous Dave's--the ribs may not be quite as good, but they offer a better variety meats (ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, sausage, and wings) than Smokey Bones with the additional flexibility to build a combo of those choices to your liking.  If you're looking for hot doughnuts to accompany some decent tasting ribs, you'll have to go to Smokey Bones."}
{"text":"I'm going to jump right in here and give Smokey Bones a 3.5 star rating... It is what it it is, a chain BBQ restaurant with a shack feel in a good way! For those familiar with Famous Daves you'll appreciate this place. They smoke their own meats, aren't pretentious, and if you leave hungry it's your own fault.  The service was pleasant and our waitress answered all of our questions while providing recommendations when we asked. We ended up splitting a full rack of Baby Backs (dry rub finished) with three sides including baked beans, fire roasted corn, and onion rings. Sharing was definitely the way to go unless you're really hungry.  I've had Q from all over the country and this is neither the best or worst thats crossed my lips but holds it's own when you're jonesing for smokey sticky goodness. I'm still a one off hole in the wall kind of guy but in the absence of that Smokey Bones takes care of the craving.  Some things to keep in mind are the beef brisket and beef ribs are only available after 16:00 (4:00 pm for those not familiar with the 24 hour clock) while the smoked prime rib is only available Thursday through Saturday nights..."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch.  Haven't been for a very long time - years, since I visited.  Ordered the $9.99 'Power Lunch' I think it was called.  One meat, and two sides.  Ordered Pulled Pork, dirty rice and broccoli.  I also ordered an Arnold Palmer as my beverage.  I think there were a grand total of 15 people in the entire place (very telling on a Wed, at 12 noon-ish, for Lunch).  Food came very quickly (good), but I immediately noticed that I got a grand total of, maybe, three ounces of pulled pork, two slices of overdone garlic toast, rice and broc.  My issue was with the amount of pork.  First, I do not ever require a ton of food for any meal, so this is not your typical, 'I didn't get 2 or 3 meals out of my meal' comment.  What I'm saying is, the serving of pulled pork was much too small for any means.  Why didn't I ask my server about same, you ask?  Well, I really do not go out to lunch with the idea that I will need to call out problems like this.  I have no desire to be a restaurant operations consultant.  The food was o.k. - nothing special - Chipotle sauce with very little chipotle.  An overiced, overpriced drink from a kid sized mason jar mug for $2.99?  Seriously?  Basically, I'm done with Smokey Bones - and so are most people, as I can see the place was almost entirely empty regardless of the many large nearby office buildings.  Adios."}
{"text":"No server came for awhile however we stopped a server, Lora, and she immediately stepped in and did a fantastic job making sure my meal was gluten and dairy free. She took excellent care of us and the food was very good and reasonably priced. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Dinner was reasonably priced and the food was good. The wait staff was very busy considering there wasn't a lot of customers. The biggest thing that surprised me was the cost of beer. If I had known it would be $8 a beer I would have stayed at the hotel bar."}
{"text":"We stopped in last night for an appetizer and a beer with some friends. I'm not sure what happened to the late night special priced menu after 10pm, but i guess they dont have it anymore. They used to though, our party chatted about on our way home & we all remember it.  Bobby & i shared the crowd pleaser appetizer which is loaded nachos, loaded fries, onion rings & 3 chicken fingers-- along with ranch & honey mustard. Its funny because the reason I wanted to head to Smokey Bones is that i had a wiff of someone's hot wings earlier in the day & then didn't even end up getting wings.   I believe during late night the seating is just in the bar area. There are also a few high-top tables near there. Speaking of seating, i didn't realize until last night how large this restaurant is and how many booths there are. It's way larger than what it looks from outside.   We sat at the bar & ate/drank. The bartender was such a sweetie. She was kind and conversated with us, asking what we do for a living and just general conversation. Some bartenders arent so friendly."}
{"text":"Our server Aaye was nice and friendly. I got steak and spinach salad. It was fab. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I haven't actually ever disliked anything I've gotten here.  Lately it's been mostly takeout, and my go to is the pulled pork cuban.  Filling and tasty.  The service here is sometimes spotty, but I think it has less to do with the competent (in my experience) wait staff and more to do with the face that every time I've visited it's been a ghost town.    Plenty of good seats still (always) available during the weekly lunch crush.    Good things here: pulled pork wings ribs sweet potato stix  Nice break from my usual seemingly perpetual asian-inspired menu."}
{"text":"I went here tonight with a former colleague after being a regular at the Smokey Bones of Cranberry. SB is my favorite restaurant in Cranberry, so expectations were high going in.  Val was our waitress, and she was nice enough but definitely not interested in serving (who would be?). When she took our beverage order, she informed us that there was no raspberry (or sweet) tea. We both ordered water and she rambled on about the Coke and alcoholic products they sold. It took three or four times  of saying \"just water\" before she took the hint.  We ordered the cornbread as our appetizer, and it came out almost instaneously and was quite warm. I think I got my $6 worth there.  My friend ordered chicken tenders and mashed potatoes (his usual everywhere we go, I swear) and had no complaints.  I had the Texas-style brisket with broccoli and fries. The broccoli was nice and hot but was steamed to death, no flavor at all. The fries were perfect. The brisket, however, was on the verge of cold and was very fatty. It was nasty; I might actually never eat brisket again. I may have gotten eight ounces with the fat, but only two of meat. The garlic bread was also overcooked for my taste, but still edible.  Smokey Bones is hit-or-miss; tonight was a miss."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink with some friends and watched the game Christina was a great bartender and gave us excellent service during the game"}
{"text":"I  AM also one of those that when it opened it was pretty good for a chain...BUT, they changed greatly in food quality and portion size.I spoke with the manager she I think said they have had to cut back. Thats a good thing to tell a customer....NOT      YES CUT BACK AND I WILL NOT BE BACK.   At least they had their Q not just on certain days?????"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  I had a party of 5 with me, and we waited 15 minutes for our drinks.  Another order was never placed in the kitchen.  Manager apologized, but unfortunately this place is being ran into the ground."}
{"text":"We ordered take out tonight. Several issues, all of which were ignored by the manager when brought to her attention. Coupon was not excepted. Baked potato was not fully cooked. There was no choice or enough quantity of sauce. Customer satisfaction was clearly not the managers top priority and I don't think, with increased competition in the BBQ market locally, we will be back! Place was empty when I went to pick up and I think I know why. USED TO BE my favorite BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Carlo is without a doubt the best bartender/waiter. I make Smokey Bones a regular stop when I'm in Robinson because I appreciate his quick and amiable service. He always has a recommendation and is more than willing to talk me through the menu. Go to Smokey Bones, and ask for Carlo!!"}
{"text":"We've gone to Smokey Bones once before but this time we had a buy one get one free dinner coupon so we decided to give it another try. We came around 6-6:15 and it was packed. The line was almost out the door, so we go right to the bar...and to our surprise the place is DEAD inside. They're telling people it's a 15 min wait, when there is no one even in the damn place! WTF?!   Our draft beers both tasted skunked, just not really good overall. The bartender was all over the place, not really conversational. I ordered the ribs, a full rack with corn and mashed potatoes...I'd give the ribs a C and my sides an F. I absolutely hated the smokey flavor of the corn and the potatoes had zero flavor because the corn was so overpowering.   My boyfriend played it safe with fish & chips (I got that last time) we knew it was good before and it was good this time. So if you do want to try out this place, try the fish & chips..."}
{"text":"Well I can honestly say the bbq was absolutely phenomenal!!! Although maybe a little bit overpriced. On a much sadder note, the sweet tea was was totally lacking sweetness whatsoever which is unfortunately an important necessity with bbq. And I would like to see this place have a little more of a country-style atmosphere although that is subject to every humans opinion. But I love all the boneisms (quotes) on the wall especially in the bathroom they are very entertaining!! Also another cool thing is they have free wi-fi."}
{"text":"I will first say, just DON'T go!  Take the hour drive east to Mentor and go to that one. This location was less than horrible. We were say quickly at a very sorry table. Then asked to move. It was 30 degrees outside and inside wasn't much better. After being sat someone came to the table and her uniform was pretty dirty. We simply ordered a Pepsi and a ginger ale and a water. Didn't receive the water. Was given a Pepsi and a bottle of ginger ale and a disgusting dirty glass with gross food stuck to the inside and outside of it. No straws. When we asked for the water and straws she never came back. This was our 20 minute ordeal. We grabbed our jackets and left.  What HORRIBLE service and the restaurant was completely filthy. One server was actually yelling at another in front of customers on the floor. Ridiculous!  I will be writing corporate. Nobody noticed we left."}
{"text":"Their cornbread w/pecan butter (appetizer) is awesome! Majority of the menu is somewhat comparable to applebee's, but w/more bbq-type food."}
{"text":"Well let's see where do I begin?  Drinks are top notch. Appetizers leave much to be desired. Barbeque is dry slaw well it's a lot salty.   Service is good and only good. Kitchen is verrrryyyyy slow. Was beginning to wonder if they had to kill the pig. I keep trying but never overjoyed"}
{"text":"After dining at this joint I kept thinking: if we were truly what we eat, what would I turn into: dry turkey burger with a  smear of  spoiled avocado o top or over-marinated sour steak? Yes, you heard it right. They commit all the mortal sins of the chain restaurant circa 1995: they marinate hell out of the meat giving it uncharacteristic formaldehyde taste of a cow cadaver, they serve only white wonder bread along rusty iceberg salad with rotten tomatoes, and then they bring out diluted coffee along with Tapioca pudding.  We came as ravenously hungry thriving group of carnivores and left as fools who just got fed the garbage.  I returned home nauseated and questioning the reality."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy this restaurant for it's food, atmosphere, and cleanliness. The last time I went in the score had dropped to 91.5. I ordered a cornbread to go. When I got home with it I found the cornbread in a used to go box. The cornbread had been placed on top of a lid of some kind of sauce and was inedible. I threw it in the garbage and will never go back to Smokey Bones on J M Keynes in Charlotte,NC"}
{"text":"While not as good as Famous Dave's as most will tell you here...It still isn't bad if you know what to order.... Their prices are a bit high... But if you eat late after 10pm they have a Special on apps.  Here's a few things on that list after 10pm Smoked Wings 6$(Tasted great and you get 8 wings) The Loaded fries 4$ were awesome but i'd suggest getting most of the sauces on the side as it can become to salty and sometimes to sweet with the BBQ.  Bone Pretzels 5$ I would stay away from... you get 4 pretzel sticks and they are by far the worse Pretzels I've had at a sit down location.  They were cold yet the outside were way to dark telling me they were frozen to start with.    I've had ribs here as well and their pulled pork and a few other meets a while back.  Their ribs are ok and are cheaper then Famous daves by 3 or 4 dollars.  However the quality is not anywhere near Famous Daves.  Their  pulled pork and brisket are a little bit better but it isn't consistent.(sometimes to salty or fatty)   I also have had their smoked turkey bacon avocado triple decker sandwich. I also upgrade my side to the baked mac and cheese.  The sandwich isn't that great, I had to keep adding the honey mustard bbq sauce to it to give it flavor and the bread was dry.  The mac and cheese side was not worth the 2$ upgrade as I would have been fine with just there mash potatoes(which is actually good) next time.  Their baked beans are ridiculously too sweet and would not suggest them.  The Chocolate cake desert with ice cream is actually really good.   Things at smokey bones are really hit or miss but if you know what to order then your good.  P.S. It's a good thing they have the Smokey Bone's rewards Card and some nice coupons around their 14th anniversary, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered to even go back to try the other selections."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for dinner if you're a fan of the chain, but I've had better. The real reason to go to a Smokey Bones is for their half-priced appetizer \"happy hour\" deals anyway.   The food at this one was sub-par in my opinion, especially their \"Old Faithful\" chicken noodle soup. I don't think I've tasted a more awful chicken soup, which is kind of surprising since it's a hard thing to mess up. Their chicken/onions/potato skin platter was decent, but again - way too greasy. The pulled pork was alright, I guess, but other places have much better portion sizes for the money.  The waiter also kept forgetting parts of our order, but at least he was patient enough when we kept calling him over.  If you're a stickler for quality, I'd look for somewhere else to grab dinner. If you're a Smokey Bones fanatic though, go for it. Just don't expect it to hold up to other SBs."}
{"text":"Update: it has probably been a year since I've eaten here before and I can say it's a night and day experience. I had the create your own combo with the BBQ chicken and the grilled chicken breast with baked beans and loaded mashed potatoes and mannnnnnnnnnnnnnn it was tasty! The chicken was moist and tasty. I'm a BBQ sauce person, so I added extra sauce to my chicken but honestly it isn't even needed. The bartender, Liz was exceptionally nice and the manager, Natalie, walked by every table to check on the service. I'm impressed and will definitely be back! Extra star earned. Try the BBQ chicken and let me know if my experience was just a fluke.   Came here on Monday night for the wing special. Sat at the bar. The bar was sticky/dirty from various sauces of the people that sat here previously. The bartender did wipe it when we asked so I guess that means something.   So let's talk about the good wing deal: it's 10.99 for 8 wings and fries (but I think you have to order a drink... Did not confirm if it had to be alcohol... BUT it's unlimited wings on Monday after 9 pm. I highly recommend the smoked wings. It by far tastes the best and its lightly drizzled with a bbq sauce. After you're done with the first 8 wings you may order the next ones in batches of 4 (any flavor you want).    I don't know if I can recommend any of the sauces that are tossed. I had the garlic parmasean but it was chunks of garlic and parm clumped together on some dry wings. And it falls off easily. Mind you I only ate a total of 12 wings.   I do like the fact they give you hand wipes because things will get messy. I also like the fact they had dogfish head 90 minute IPA. Yummy! The bartender was really cool and gave good recommendations.    I would've given an extra star, but my mood was greatly diminished by the obnoxious girl with the sleeve of tattoos on her left arm (I assume she works here too because she knew most of the staff by name) who drank way too much and grew louder with each beverage. She seems like a regular. Let's just say if I entered the restaurant and saw (more like heard) her there, I would leave immediately. Do not pass go. Do not collect $100. Will I come again? Maybe next month. But only under that stipulation."}
{"text":"The food is delicious at smokey bones , from there burgers to ribs . Good tasting alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"Not very good brisket...it tasted like reheated meat...pulled pork was ok but not great. Baked beans were crunchy and my fire roasted corn was somewhat warm not hot just warm.  What is really embarrassing is I told one work friend who never tried brisket to try it too...I told him that brisket when cooked low and slow is excellent but this was not good...I told him later I'd take him to the harmony inn for the way a brisket is suppose to taste, or I'd smoke one myself on a day off, to make up for the reheated dryed out brisket we had here.   I wont ever get the brisket there again...maybe a pulled pork sandwich if I get a real BBQ craving and I'm close by there for lunch break."}
{"text":"Prompt service, friendly staff, HUGE drink menu, large portions, large menu to choose from. I had the steak salad 4.5*, friend 1 Hawaiian ribeye 4*, friend 3 huge magnachos 4*; I also had the pork and chicken stew and it was super delicious"}
{"text":"Smoked wings for sure and the Mac n cheese is surprisingly flavorful too. Not to mention the coldest beer I've ever had! (Only $3)"}
{"text":"sadly, my only southern bbq experience was here, only out of convenience since it was within walking distance to our hotel. the local coworkers weren't fans of it either. the food wasn't THAT bad, but the service was horrid by one of our two servers. we were a group of about 12, and the female waitress was in her own little world. example, she forgot about our cornbread, saying she wasn't sure if we were ordering it since we had ordered fried kettle chips. really? when our senior VP asked for Kendall Chardonnay, she repeats it as Ketel One? Really?!?! 5 people ordered wine, and the first 3 got it in wine glasses. the other 2 got it in irish coffee mugs as they ran out of wine glasses, i think the 3 were the only ones in the restaurant. oh when our Senior VP asked about his glass of wine, she told him they were still making it. making wine? really? sorry, but she got on my dang nerves as she was forgetting everything, and never asking if we needed anything. our other server, jared was great and prompt. however, he said he made my mojito, and it was the sweetest mojito i ever had. as sweet as the sweet tea. no bueno. i didnt taste any alcohol.  the fried kettle chips were good, but the only sauce that was good was the bleu cheese. i got the sweet tea, as i wanted to try everything southern, and the first was uber sweet. second one was not sweet at all! so odd. not consistent. the corn bread skillet, was very cake-y, not enjoyable.   i ordered the 3 item platter, as i wanted a taste of everything. had the sausage (Was told it would be spicy, yay!), pulled pork, and the beef brisket. i chose the fancier side of macaroni and cheese (a must for me) and their coleslaw. the mac and cheese, although we killed it, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. the coleslaw was just ok. the pulled pork was good, but it tasted like something i have had in CA. dissapointed. the brisket was bleh. the sausage was disgusting, and not spicy at all. oh i think the best thing was the texas toast like bread that came with the dish. sad.   lastly, their bathroom REEKS of URINE. i thought it was just me, but my other coworkers had the same reaction without me telling them beforehand. it's a large restroom (about 6 stalls), and it seriously smells like someone peed all over the ground. the employees must use this restroom, are they immune to it and have not noticed? yuck.  wouldnt come back again."}
{"text":"I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great, chain or otherwise, the food was blah. First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.  Our waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).  We had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \"bones\" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.  Having read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \"lunch\" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \"fire roasted corn\" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.  We didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.  Would I go back? No, I don't think so."}
{"text":"Josh on the bar and Natalie in the kitchen are an awesome combo!!! Drinks are always on point and the grub exceeded all expectations"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. 5:30ish on a Friday. Friendly hostess, really nice server who didn't talk our ears off, just got the order and did a good job keeping an eye on us. I had the Cuban which was tasty and baked beans, yummers.  Sister had the steak spinach salad, pretty good although she thought it had way too many mushrooms. We split the cheese fries that were awesome. Paid on the little machine on the table which I thought was a bit odd but convenient. In, out, full but not stuffed, good place."}
{"text":"Our food was spectacular, from the skillet cornbread to the smoked wings.  Hillary was our waitress and she did an amazing job taking care of our needs and recommending choices.  What a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Listen, I LOVE RIBS!!!  It is a chain restaurant that has good tasting BBQ sauce.  We had no problems with the wait or service, like some of the other reviews, but we did come on a Sunday evening.  The ribs were cooked well enough that I ordered another slab, meat was tender and sauce was good.  I've had better ribs, but for a chain restaurant, these were decent.  We will give them another try."}
{"text":"We had a BOGO entree coupon from this place (which I presume means they aren't doing so hot lately...) so figured we would give it a try.   The log cabin decor is just weird, not my style at all. I got the 1/3 rack of ribs, mashed potatoes, and roasted corn. The ribs were decent, nice and moist. Their barbecue sauce is nothing to write home about though...pretty boring. The roast corn was a little too smoke-flavored for my tastes. The potatoes were pretty decent. $13 for a 1/3 rack of ribs is too pricey though, IMO. I was pretty much still hungry after eating here.   Mr. had the chicken fingers...pretty hard to mess those up, so they were fine. Fries were pretty good. All in all, this is just a boring chain place. The servers were friendly and prompt. I might go back if they give me another BOGO coupon."}
{"text":"Food was horrible and service even worse. We usually sit at the bar for a more personal experience but these two bar tenders were virtually invisible and seemed like they could not wait to leave. One had to keep apologizing for the bad service and bad food. This place will not be in business much longer. Cold tacos, prepared wrong, Over cooked burgers and wrong amount on check when it was presented. Manager took the tacos off but as far as I am concerned the whole meal should have been comped. No excuses. When we decided to go out and brace the below zero temps outside they should be happy we came and not complain that they are slammed. Too bad. Could be a really cool place with the proper managers."}
{"text":"Carlo is the bomb.com! Gave great recommendations and crafted the most delicious mixed drinks to help us start a weekend binder off right! We knew him so well by the end of the meal we asked him to join! (he politely declined)...Next time Carlo! Stay Beautiful."}
{"text":"I see this place has a number of low ratings, but for all intents and purposes this is one of the better bbq places I have been to in NE Ohio. Now to be clear, this is not one of the best places I've ever eaten for bbq as it is a chain, but overall they do a good job. I do not drink so my review is not based on alcohol but simply food. Every once in a while when we go their service is a little slow but that is usually pretty good as well. The food is quite tasty. They have a number of options to choose from ranting from smoked meats to sandwiches to even pasta. I've enjoyed basically everything I've gotten there with the exception of the Cuban sandwich which was very skimpy on meat. I'd recommend this if you like ribs also because they do a good job of smoking them and retaining the smoke ring."}
{"text":"We generally like Smokey Bones. Got there about 7::45 last night, Sat. evening. Busy, told it would be about a 1 hr. wait. Okay, we're hungry, and love BBQ. Buzzer went off in about 20 minutes, yippee! This makes a good evening out even better, right?   Waitress was somewhere else that night, just said what was necessary to take our order. Smiling wasn't an option for this girl.   Everything came as ordered, and nice and hot. (almost a rare commodity at some venues). This is a good start. Appetizers good. Entree arrives. Looks good. Pulled pork; tasty. Cut into the ribs; uh oh! Tough, no semblance of wanting to come off the bone. Did I say tough, really tough. Bad chewing texture, flavor almost nonexistent. Something is not right. Ugh! Can't eat them.   Because I had enough to eat anyway, and waitress was distant, I just let it go. Left them virtually untouched on my plate; no question or concern expressed from waitress. It will be awhile to get over this experience.   If it weren't for the faster than expected seating and the good appetizers, this would have been 1 star."}
{"text":"This may be a very small chain - I'm just not that sure and didn't have time to really research it - besides - you are reading this because it's a review.  Went here for lunch with two colleagues and our server's name was Charles - very nice gentlemen - almost like I was down south where the service is always friendly. We each ordered something a bit different from one another and all three meals were served together and in a very timely manner - considering this was lunch and I needed to get the training done - time was important and it met my plan!  The food was great and they were accommodating to my requests. I wanted the pulled pork BBQ sandwich without of course the bread - that way I saved carb counting to the french fries that were really delicious. In fact - the pulled pork was good and the brewed ice tea - perfect! +  Place was clean - prices were reasonable - service and speed were good - and the variety was great.  So - let me end with the phenomenal soup - yep - it was that good! Every day is different and I'd be willing to try them ALL!  Perfect it was not - but a solid four stars for sure - my pulled pork though tasty wasn't quite hot enough - temperature that is!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in a long time. I had the salmon with butter sauce. It was very delicious. My fiancé had the pulled pork. It was very flavorful. Along with the sides. Mashed potatoes, broccoli, and Cole slaw. Thanks for the great service as well and the 10$ coupon was a bonus."}
{"text":"First time here, & I'm in love!  The best corn bread ever and the honey pecan butter is to die for!  Absolute must order!  I had the brown sugar glazed baby back ribs, very tender & flavorful.  House baked beans are slamming, and the onion rings were perfect."}
{"text":"Simply put, not so impressed. But I should have figured/known better what I got myself into. It was my mothers idea, take out there, with the 10 dollars for 20 dollars worth of food. The place is known for barbecue, ribs, burgers I guess... I decided to try their new Asian Chicken Pasta Cream...thing.. because I'm not a fan of barbecue to much... I was figuring something good with grilled chicken with a bunch of flavors on top, with alot of sauces like they smear sauces all over their meats.. but on the pasta..... turned out to be a big fat no. Was in a little container, and looked like something from a microwave meal dish.   Unhappy, I ended up putting it in the fridge the next day and doctoring it up with my own sauce homemade on the stove to make it actually have a taste. The rest of my family who also did the 10 dollars worth 20 mean ended up kind of liking there. Kinda.. I think... Over all, Never get pasta there..."}
{"text":"I give this Restaurant a FIVE STAR RATING!!! Working as a server myself and as a manager in retail, it's hard for people who haven't had to work in a setting like a restaurant or with the public in sales, to understand certain bumps or mishaps in a common dining experience (SO of course you're going to have plenty of people complaining about \"poor service\" or \"a side dish being cold\" or \"having to wait longer than they feel they should\") many people don't understand the strength and dedication it takes to deal with the public. I love coming to eat at Smokey Bones in Mentor and getting to have a drink with my coworkers after a long shift or a refreshing mango tea and some delicious chicken wings (with lots of ranch of course, as my favorite servers already know) Christina, Chris and Ryan are incredible and outstanding bartenders and know exactly how to make my dining experience top notch!! I never have to worry about them not giving me the best service possible, because even though I'm a regular and  I'm extremely predictable in what I'm eating and drinking every visit, they still make me feel like it's my first time there and the experience is a 11/10!!! I want to thank Meghan M, the incredible manager who I have been so blessed to get close to over the course of my visits the last few years, for always running such a smooth shift and helping out whenever she's needed by her staff! She's a true gem and you're very lucky to have her as a partner in your corporation! PLEASE KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK SMOKEY! Your service is greatly appreciated and I'll keep visiting for as long as you're in business (hopefully forever) Your friendly neighbor ;)"}
{"text":"We went to dinner with our oldest son. He picked Smokey Bones. It was the late afternoon so there weren't many people in the restaurant.  My hubby ordered the Southwest Mac and Cheese. My son ordered the \"Pick Two\"-smoked wings and dry rub ribs. I also ordered the \"Pick Two\"-smoked wings an pulled pork. I chose fire roasted corn and coleslaw.  Our meals came out quickly which was nice because we were so hungry. I ate the smoked wings first and they were incredible. They had a smokey sweet sauce that went perfect with the smoked wings. I think I had the sauce all over my hands and face. Thank goodness they gave us wet wipes. The pork was was tender and moist. There were 3 different types of BBQ sauce-mustard base, spicy, and sweet. I went for the sweet. It didn't disappoint. Both the corn and the coleslaw were good. The Texas toast that came with it was soggy and inedible.  The restaurant and the bathroom were very clean. Our server was very nice. It was a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I met a friend during lunch break . We both ordered salads with the potato soup.  The soup was not served hot.  It was  barely warm.   The salad was over-dresseed.  With all the other options in Robinson, I rather eat elsewhere.   We both agreed we liked our Friday's lunch better. I will say though thay the price was right! $8 is a steal!"}
{"text":"Right off the bat, I will say this-  the food here is quite good, but this place needs a good dose of increased professionalism.   There was nobody at the front desk to seat us when we walked in, but we eventually got seated in about 2 minutes.  No big whoop.  The food took a while to arrive, and it was hard to find our server when we needed additional items.  The hickory smoked salmon was excellent, but the portion was ridiculously small.  I felt like I was eating a kid's meal!  The sides were quite tasty, and the cole slaw and mac and cheese were, quite possibly, the best i've ever had, but again, small portions for a typical adult.  The dessert selection is not too good, and they don't have 'half portions' like Applebee's does.  When it comes to desserts,  'half portions' are a must these days, especially if you have kids (they did not have kid's portions here), or just want a more normal dose of calories and sugar.  The food was on the pricey side for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Called 2 hours before closing on a Saturday night. Never mentioned that they were serving only fried foods.  Took 10 minutes just to put our drink order in.  Waitress was very rude!  Only half the order came out. Probably won't visit again."}
{"text":"We went there on a weekday for dinner. Surprisingly not to many people there (which is good for me). Been trying to try the smoked slabs so i got the \"double trouble\" so i could try both the baby back and st. louis style. Im nont a fan of the st.louis style they're a lil too smokey for me but the babybacks were pretty nice. The amount of side dishes that are available is pretty large and you can upgrade to premium sides (which we did). They have decent beers like sam addams and blue moon. The prices were decent and the waiter was pretty decent. I don't really have any complaints so far and i could definately see going back to sample more things on their menu. i definately think this place beats alot of the alternative barbecue joints around."}
{"text":"They do BBQ well. The pulled pork and beef brisket are excellent. Love the cole slaw. They have a huge selection on their menu. Burgers, Salads,  Wings, Pasta,  Salmon. Nothing beats the bag of hot homemade donuts!"}
{"text":"Ran in for a to-go order.  Waited at the hostess stand for too long, but that didn't compare to how long we waited for our food.  We were told 20 minutes.  After 30 I started wearing the stank face.  No one came to check in with us.  Matter of fact it appeared that they were avoiding the hostess stand about this time because folks that came in for a table were left to wait until a random person came to seat them.   One lady felt so bad for us she walked back into the kitchen alley where she told them that there were guests in the foyer waiting for food for a 1/2 hour.  \"I took care of that for you,\" she said.   Around this time the manager emerged from her office.  Our food came out around this time and we were told our meals would be free after we waited for so long.  We felt like this was a kind gesture, but a heads up before hand would have been more appreciated.   We took our orders and retreated back to our hotel room.  About five minutes later my phone lights up.  I'm getting text from my travel companion.  She HATES her food.  \"This aint even brisket, Bobby.  This sht is like two little strings of meat on a giant glob of fat!\" \"No girl, it's the fatty end.  I'm sure it's good - and now you got me excited because you can't hardly get restaurants to serve that...  Oh...\" She was right.  The brisket was like two or three strands of meat on a pillow of semi to moderately smoky fat.   \"The macaroni and cheese is edible.\" That was the only compliment my companion had for the meal.  As I write this I can remember the mediocre flavors of the ribs, sausage and brisket but that mac and cheese just was not memorable.  Matter of fact, I wish I could forget the entire experience."}
{"text":"I've been to 3-4 different Smokey Bones restaurants and have never been dissatisfied with the food.  I always stuff my face.  The food is consistent at each location so my review is for the food, not necessarily the location.  The food doesn't compare to that of the 'mom and pop' type barbecue places that go to competitions and win awards, but it does surpass similar restaurants with equal price points such as Applebee's, Friday's, and Bennigans.  Don't get me wrong, I like all those other restaurants but you go there more for the ambiance then actual quality / quantity of food.  I always go with the 3 meat platter with brisket, smoked sausage, and pulled pork.  Throw some mashed potatoes w/ gravy and steamed broccoli and this guy is stuffed.  I also enjoy having my choice of 3 sauces for my meat.  Now keep in mind that I only gave 3 stars.   I believe Smokey Bones is a craving restaurant.  I only go there when I am starving and am craving my man platter, which turns out is only 2-3 times a year.  I go to the above mentioned restaurants 5-10 times a year, especially the Friday's that is right across the street for their super happy hour.  So if you're a bbq snob, stay away, do some research and find that hole in a wall that you are really looking for.  But if your just a hungry guy looking for a big meal and lots of leftovers, head over to Smokey Bones, you'll start getting that craving months later."}
{"text":"The food quality went down hill. I used to come for smoked wings and ribs. The food is so salty like eating salt jar. The rub is so salty. The ribs doesn't have much flavor but salty. Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I start this by saying I hate barbeque sauce and most anything thats slathered in it. But....We checked this place out a few weeks ago and I was very impressed. I say this coming from someone who hasn't experienced true authentic KC, Louisana, Carolina, or TX barbeque or whereverelse that crazy blend of sauces comes from. I ordered the pulled pork entree with a side of coleslaw and smashed red skins. Loved it! all because it had no sauce at all on it and they have quite a selection of sauces to choose from at the table. So I choose the Caroline Moppin and the Chipotle, really spiced things up. He had a pick 4 with about everything on the menu, he was impressed as much as I was. For the price and atmosphere, it was a good place for him to get his meat fix and for me to come out of my barbeque shell. We will be back.   Nice drink selection too,  not your typical beers on draft...which was another plus!"}
{"text":"Just left without even getting our food.  We were there over an hour just for 2 orders of wings (which we never got) and an appetizer.  We paid for our drinks an appetizer which took a long time to get.  We had to flag down the waiter every time we needed him which was to ask where our food was.  The service was awful and the manager never came near our table even though we saw the waiter talking to him when we asked for our bill for drinks and an appetizer. He actually walked around the bar on the other side our table seemingly avoiding us.  I would post a pick of our food but we never got it..."}
{"text":"The service and staff were great - awesome.  So nice to find in today's world when not everyone seems to enjoy dealing with customers.  The ribs were disappointing - not tender and tasty - tough and chewy is not what I expect from baby back ribs.  The smoked wings were great - a different take on wings - meaty and yummy"}
{"text":"First of all my friend and I didn't really realize it was mother's day weekend. That said we were seated promptly even though it was busy. Our waitress , however, just couldn't seem to think that we didn't need to be pushed out of the restaurant. I have never been this rushed in my life. I was a server at one time , so I always make sure to leave a good tip. This is the first time in many years I only left 10%. Guess that will confirm her suspicion that women out together do not tip. *sigh* My baby back ribs were good, but the other rack of I'm not sure what they were called were awful. Tough, and had an odd taste, they were more like prime rib than I am used to ribs being. My friend ordered all baby backs but was served a section that looked exactly like the section I received. Fifty dollars for two people without cocktails nor appetizers is way too rich for my blood, ecspecially for ribs. I will not go back."}
{"text":"In lobe with this place good food great employees beautiful environment love the fire outside"}
{"text":"Horrible bar service, terrible menu. Not busy, had to wait forever for service, menu, bill. Won't be back. Hate chains, thought we would give it a shot! Yuck!"}
{"text":"Open later than most for a late night dinner option on Sundays.  Just off the freeway, it wasn't too hard to find and sounded like the best option around.    Upon walking in, I stopped in the ladies' restroom and walked right out. I told the host that the ladies' needed attention - all the stalls were not fit for use. He seemed frustrated and said he'd get someone on it and went to tell someone. Came back and said it would just be a few minutes. He seated us and I figured I would go later.   The food was great, the floor show, not so much. Employees bickering at the order window and the bar regular (or off duty employee) that wore a path between a bar stool and the front entrance for a smoke seemed to know every employee on duty and graced us with ode to Camel with each pass.   The smoked chicken wings will have me seeking out a Smoky Bones for as long as they keep them on the menu. The Chopped Chicken Salad was just as you would expect, but the chopped just refers to the chicken, the lettuce is not chopped salad.  My hubs burger was good. The soups looked awful but tasted better than they looked. Three people ate for $60 and left happy.    The waitress was fantastic. Her service and the food will keep us coming back to Smoky Bones - though probably not this location. I attempted the restroom again, after the meal, and it was clear that no one had been in there to clean it up. I wanted to ask someone for a rag and cleaner so I could use it, but opted for the gas station down the street instead.   I hope Management can get this place together a little better. The food is great."}
{"text":"Normally, I have a good experience at another location & thought this one would be the same. This time however, my experience was horrible. Our server never suggested any items nor did she check on us the entire meal. The manager came over to check- broccoli was undercooked & the mashed potatoes & gravy were too peppery & tasted horrible. At the least, our server passed our table 4 times without asking how things were. I paid the bill just to get out of there & will not be returning to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Update concerning the cole slaw. ...they changed the recipe. ....no longer the best.   Why would they change it?    Recent visit was a disappointment.  Cool greeting, a server with no personality, nachos which we sent back.  Forgot my cole slaw.  However,   Ribs were very good and I love the sauce choices.  Would I come back?  Maybe if someone gave me another gift card. Seems these chain restaurants think they don't have to try very hard."}
{"text":"Terrible!!! The worst customer service!!! Be aware!! They steal your money, lie, and blame each other!!! Stay away from that place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've given other Smoking Bones high marks but this one I cannot.  Now I must admit at this one I never consumed a beverage because yesterday I sat at the bar 10 mins. and the bartender was slammed and didn't even say hi and didn't smile and so I left.  And then today for lunch I went in and there was no hostess around 2 p.m. and there was (possibly the same one?) a bartender doing other...stuff and I left after waiting and I believe the couple waiting in front of me left too.    Last night the guy standing at the bar next to me when I wanted to eat also left and I left when he did.  So in actuality I owe the bartender a drink at BRAVO! next door because that meal was divine, thank you very much actually."}
{"text":"Man does Smokey Bones work really hard on its image, harder than a teenager that just transferred to a new school even. Instead of going with a soul patch angle, as BBQ joints are wont to do, Smokey Bones sort of wants to catch some of the suburban faux hipness that TGI Friday's and Applebee's co-own these days. I mean, there ain't nothin' bluesy 'bout Robinson, a place where a dynasty of chains rule with an iron...bowl of spinach artichoke dip.   Signs with somewhat witty sayings and double entendres are all around you as are a dozen televisions, which on this night were showing baseball games, music videos, and shorts from The Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, and one of my heroes, Mr. Bean. I was having flashbacks of the TV room at the Andy Warhol Museum!  Hey, Kay wanted to come here, I didn't. However, being out of ideas at the moment and feeling kind of slummy and discombobulated from a busy work week, my will was as bendable as a Gumby action figure.   The Pretzel Bones were rather excellent, shockingly enough, and you get a newspaper-lined basket of 'em. They're buttered, soft, steamy, and are served with 3 dipping sauces: Sweey Honey Mustard, Creamy Queso, and Garlic Parmesan. Of them all, I kept going for the garlic most often, although the others were solidly delectable. These are the kind of pretzel rods that need to conquer the malls, ballparks, and arenas of the Americas in order to spare us from the banality of Auntie Anne's.  Wanting ribs badly, madly, I went with the Double Trouble platter, which will getcha 1/3 of a rack each of their Smoked St. Louis Ribs and their Baby Back Ribs. I tried one with the Memphis Dry Rub and the other with the Original glaze.   The Smoked St. Louis Ribs were insurance seminar-dry. They purport to marinate them for 4 hours and then smoke them for another 4. My mother makes better ribs than these, and they take her no more than half as much time to make. What is it with low-and-slow anyway? Whenever I have any kind of meat cooked that way, it often ends up losing flavor and moisture. Is a lack of proper technique to blame?   The Baby Back Ribs were much better and pulled from their bones easily, my teeth tearing through them without resistance or hesitation. I can't remember which flavor I got on which, but I had no problem with either. Both were sweet, rich; your typical BBQ sauce.   My 2 sides stole the show. The Loaded Baked Potato was as loaded as a senator getting kickbacks. The requisite sour cream, butter, chives, bacon particles, and cheddar cheese were all there in spades. The inside of the potato was ideally lush, humid.  My Creamy Cole Slaw had sass, freshness, snap, sugar, and loads of color. I could have made a perfectly fine meal out of the appetizer, sides, and some of the baby back ribs.   SB has some desserts that sound really interesting. One was a Bag of Donuts. Another was Apple Wontons. Kay wanted to share a slice of their huge chocolate cake that comes with vanilla ice cream. The ice cream was from heaven. If they don't make it themselves, I'd love to know where they get it from. The cake was rich enough but tasted a day or so old.   For a Friday night, this Smokey Bones wasn't exactly teeming with activity. We were given a large corner booth, and there were only 2 of us. I guess it ain't the place to be.   P.S. We had no issues whatsoever with the service. Our server Ash was competent, polite, friendly and brought out everything on time. We were also seated immediately upon arrival. I don't remember using the bathroom, so I cannot comment on that.  P.P.S. I'm trying to break the chain habit, I really am. They have a hold on me, though...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8WGH4hc4pQ"}
{"text":"Wow Smokey Bones. Holy nasty bathroom. \"Lady disposal can\" hanging off the stall wall, ghetto broken locks, auto flush button on the wall but not functional...wow.   Food is very decent as always. I typically get pulled pork or a turkey club. Both are tasty. Sauce selection is good. Service is friendly and reasonable; not too fast but not painful either.  I just can't get over the bathroom. The state of the restrooms tell an awful lot about a restaurant."}
{"text":"Usually asking the server what is her favorite dish gets you a pretty good recommendation, but in this case, it was crap!  The smoked brisket had that discoloration that happens to meat when it's been sitting out for a while.  And it wasn't even tender!!  Am I asking for too much?"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for barbecue. I love BBQ Ribs and our server J.C.was very helpful in my making a choice of entrees. He explained many things on the menu and showed us his personal favorites. He was very friendly and outgoing and we had a good time with him. What Ever you do you got to get the Kettle Chips they are slamming !!! The rest of the food was great, too!"}
{"text":"We were out for some BBQ and we intended to eat at Famous Dave's, but we didn't want to wait an hour.  So went went to Smokey Bones again.  It wasn't all that bad.  I ordered briskett, pulled pork and chicken wings and my sides were mashed potatoes and corn.  The meal was tasty and the meat was well-smoked.  Overall, I'd say it was pretty good, but not great.  Everyone else ate, but didn't compliment the food all that much, so I assumed theirs was average also.  It was a quiet night, but the service was a little slow for some reason and the refills were sparse.  Recommend if Famous Dave's is full."}
{"text":"Service was awesome at the joint! Food was good but the service made up for it. Place isn't well kept up, seemed dirty and tables and floors were sticky like they hadn't been cleaned in ages. Bathroom was horrid. But we had a large party and we were celebrating and all wanted to go there. Our waitress was awesome with our large diverse family! We all wanted different things and we were all hungry. She took care of all of our needs in a very timely manner and we never wanted for anything."}
{"text":"Soooooooooo, after a 4 year hiatus, we have decided to go back to Smokey Bones for a re-do. I will take this early opportunity to divulge that the only reason we have decided to go back is that it is under new management and that new manager is a close friend. The following review, though, has nothing to do with our friendship and he was NOT present at the time I went so had nothing to do with the food or service we received. This was a real dinner visit with guests in town for the holiday and they wanted good Q and Wes assured me that the place had turned around. He was right.   I can be a harsh critic. I expect a lot from an eatery. As posted before in other reviews, I think restaurants are magic. Unfortunately, there are a lot of bad magicians out there. Smokey Bones had fallen far from pulling rabbits out of hats and was doing Wal-Mart magic kit stuff that just wasn't working for them. They needed a turn around moment or they were done. I am seriously surprised that, with our last experience and the reviews that have been posted here since, it hasn't closed it's doors. They found the magic again and here's what went down:  We were a party of 6. My immediate family and my sister and brother in law. We dropped in about 7 and entered. The design flaw of this building is that the entrance area drops you right in to the bar area which can be a bit loud but the food seating area's are much more noise appropriate. We were seated at a 6 top near the bar but found the noise level a bit much. We asked for a new seating arrangement which was immediately and pleasantly taken care of. The place was not terribly busy but several tables were occupied and most folks seemed in good spirits and were eating and drinking away.   Our server was Krista. Super pleasant, nice and attentive. She circled the table and was kind enough to repeat the special to my brother in law who was directly under the speaker (at first) and couldn't hear her.   We decided on the smoked wings for an app. GOOD CALL! These little dandy's are double smoked (according to the menu) with a dry rub and then drizzled with a sweet, almost teriyaki (sp), type of sauce. Drizzled is the main word here because too much would just be too much and the wings would have lost their appeal to me. We polished off 16 in no time flat and were unanimously impressed.   The orders around the table were varied, which was great because I got to try a little of a bunch of stuff. Across the board we were impressed with the food quality and flavors.  I got the St Louis ribs and brisket combo platter with a baked tater and broccoli. The ribs were with out compare the star of this whole program! Well rubbed, cooked to a tender but not \"falling of the bone\" overdone-ness. The smoke ring was deep and the meat was tasty. I dipped the ribs in some of the Chipotle BBQ sauce (which is now, thankfully, set at the table again for your enjoyment and mixing pleasure!). My Bro-in-law got the baby backs and was fully excited about them. I could see the incredibly deep smoke ring from where I sat a couple seats away. He finished his and got a whole rack to go for cold eating on his drive home today! My wife got the half chicken/brisket combo and was delighted in the moistness and tenderness of the chicken meat, though she is not a big sauce-er and felt that for her taste is was too saucy. She did rave however on the meat itself. My sis got polled pork and it was NICE! I stuck my fork over for a steal and agreed with her judgement. At the risk of saying moist too many times, it was really moist and flavorful. The 7 oz. medium steak my son got was well cooked and looked great but wasn't on the plate long enough for me to get a bite (cause he's a punk!) Sides were good, I loved the broccoli, the tater was well cooked and tasty and overall I was very pleased with the food.   So's we all don't think I am being pulled along by my friendship with the GM, here is the stuff that may have left us wanting a little bit. The brisket was okay, not great but well cooked, fat cap on keeping the meat (wait for it...) humid! (jk, it was moist!) but didn't blow my head off like I hoped. My sis said the slaw was okay but nothing special. It was a little loud in the bar area but sitting in the dining area took care of that.   So that's that. Sometimes you gotta change the driver. Smokey Bones was on the verge of ruin and they changed the driver to a guy who I can vouch is a true restaurant dude who is more concerned with quality than quantity of food served. His employee's seem happy to work for him and in return he gets employee's who want to continue to work for him so they do a better job.   Why 5 star's you may ask yourself. Well, my last review was a deuce and the difference in the experiences was more than a 2 star upgrade. If it were possible I would probably do 4.5 stars but, alas, it isn't a possibility so 5 it is.   The standards have been raised.  Good eating!  V-dub"}
{"text":"It was a good overall experience.  The smoked food was cooked/smoked well. Appetizer tasted good. The wait staff was very attentive and was very good. Then the wife and I found out it was only the second day the waitress was waiting tables solo.  She did a great job. Kudos to the training of new staff members to the management.  They have a new method of paying table side your credit card never leaves your hand.  This should be at every Resturant."}
{"text":"My brother and I were so pleasantly surprised by Smokey Bones! We chose to dine here because we were waiting to pick our parents up from the airport late one night.  The service was excellent and extremely friendly. We ordered the fried pickles to start.  Most restaurants serve them kind of mushy, but they were crispy like chips here, and we loved them!  I ordered the southwestern Mac and cheese.  It had the perfect amount of kick, was a great price, and most importantly, was delicious. My brother did the build your own burger.  After he was done with the add-ons it was a little pricey, but he enjoyed it, so I would say it was worth the money. I would definitely dine here again and maybe next time I'll try their drinks!"}
{"text":"Had the pretzel sticks for an appetizer as I am a sucker for soft baked pretzels I thought they were delicious. I got the burger with pulled pork on it and I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. I used the hottest BBQ sauce they offered to add some BBQ favor and it was also pretty good but I must say it wasn't all that hot. Overall a very cool place and everyone else in my party was pleased with their food. We will return for sure."}
{"text":"Been waiting a long time to have some great ribs?......... Then please wait a little longer and drive right by this place....... We had not eaten at Smokey Bones before, and one night I was just really relishing the taste of ribs, and thought, why not try a places that should , as a staple, have great ribs?!  Ordered up a full rack with great anticipation.....but while waiting, Did become a smidge concerned about the rather empty dining room....hmmmmm. Sure enough, my worries were confirmed, the ribs were basically tasteless, and how disappointed was I........... Pass this place for most anywhere else.....sad."}
{"text":"Honestly probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  First no hostess to greet/seat us.  Ended up at sitting at the bar.  Waited 45 minutes for our food.  While sitting there we saw 3 people complain/send their food back.  My boyfriend's burger came & it was completely inedible, so overcooked it was like eating sawdust.  Never did anyone ask how our food was.  The waitress saw the uneaten burger on the plate & said \"looks like you need a box\". We both just laughed and said NO.  As we left there was still not hostess.  Will never return or recommend anyone eat here."}
{"text":"My dad has a debilitating bone disease and cannot sit in a high top or booth. The hostess spoke loudly about us (mocking us) after putting up a huge fight to let us sit at a table. She was unbelievably rude. This was a Thursday night and there was literally nobody in the restaurant. I'm sure we had spit in our food. Hint!!! When you talk crap on someone make sure the entire restaurant can't hear you."}
{"text":"Geez, loox like I'm nearly alone in believing this was a pretty decent place to have a BBQ dinner in Charlotte.  I'll say it did seem like the food took long to make it to the table but once it came, it was tasty.   I enjoyed the soft pretzel things with interesting dipping sauces for starters.  Then, I really liked the combo meal with beef brisket and smoked wings...heck yeah, those were super good actually.  On the side, I had apples and hmmm something else that totally escapes me at this moment.  The carolina bbq sauces were very enjoyable as was the wonderful sweet tea to wash it all down.  Our waiter, ahem, was easy on the eyes and the 80s tunes blasting had me dancing in my seat.  I shall return.....you can bet on it."}
{"text":"First time here.   Service was ok. Food was better. I ordered the morning glory burger and the hot donuts for dessert w/ a sweet tea. All were amazing. Also their cheese fries were pretty great as well. They're known for bbq, and that's not what I ordered so for my experience and the service..... 3 stars.   Will I return: only if I'm in the area, no special trip made."}
{"text":"This seems to be the place my work crew likes to frequent when I come to Pittsburgh. I gotta say, it was better this time. Not great, but better.   I still will say the bbq itself is sub par, however, the meals that include bbq'd meat (like the pulled pork burrito I scarfed down today) do a good job concealing the quality. Let's face it - Smokey Bones is a chain with okay service, okay food and meh atmosphere. No need to avoid our seek out this place."}
{"text":"For VALUE-Seeking PORK RIB Lovers       Had a satisfying enough experience here.   This is the spot for anyone who wants PLENTY OF FLAVORFUL FOOD for the money, and isn't overly-particular about the grade of ST. LOUIS style ribs.   The grade they offer seems to be very similar to the more expensive raw racks sometimes (but rarely) available in grocery stores---not the more commonly found, less expensive SPARE ribs.    Tip ~~~ Always order ribs WITHOUT sauce.  (Naked, Bare-Bones, whatever) This way the MEAT ITSELF will be smoked, seared, charred, etc., and ready for YOU to add the sauces you want.  (They offer at least three different ones.)  Despite what you may have seen on those rib competition specials---repeated slathering of sauces, over and over again, while it's still smoking---could actually alter the flavor down to the bone.  It might even burn---like an unpleasant tacky jacket---coating the ribs.  And what if you don't like the flavor of the sauce, or the charred sauce result?  Rather than waiting for a new rack, order that first one without any sauce.  Important to note:  From my experience, ALL rib places offer their ribs already coated with sauce.  FYI, this is an easy way to cover mistakes---like especially burned racks.  Skip the sauced---add it yourself.    Accompaniments were all quite good:  Fries, Kettle Chips, Cole Slaw, Texas Toast, Margarita, too.  Service:  She was great---friendly, etc. etc.  Sorry I can't remember her name ---that's because of Margarita.  HER name I remember---she was delicious, strong, and very naughty.  This is a ST. LOUIS RIB VALUE SPOT for Hearty Eaters, Bottomless Pits, After- Gamers, Teenage Boys, and Construction Workers.   For comparison:  two racks of St. Louis (with sides that came with), one Margarita, and one Sam Adams, were about $12-$14 less (before tip) than that \"other\" one a rib-rack-toss away.    ~~~ If you're curious about the \"negative\" comments at Smokey Bones---or ANY restaurant, bar, club, etc.---go ahead and read the low-starred, but keep an open mind, and remind yourself that these spots are open to \"the public\".   We can all agree that there are many varieties comprising \"the public\" but that they basically fall into two main categories--- the positives: most often friendly / reasonable / contented sorts, and the negatives: most often jealous / frustrated / revengeful / unreasonable / hostile sorts.  (They do sometimes cross over, but someone is essentially one or the other.)  Also, when reading negative comments, ask yourself, \"If that was their problem, why didn't they just ask their server to CORRECT it instead of writing that VICIOUS UNFAIR review?\"  Probably because they WANTED to write that vicious unfair review---before they even walked in the door.  It's a negative trait kind of thing---born with it.      MOST issues are easily rectified by giving a business the opportunity TO rectify them.  If a legitimate food or beverage issue, all that smart, reasonable, considerate diners have to do is tell their server and I'll bet it's quickly corrected---and we'd never have to read ANY irrational complaints in a review.   Low-starred reviews without a single positive comment, but with especially cruel exaggerations and/or laughably trivial criticisms such as, \"no quick water refills\", \"someone seated before us\", \"she hardly smiled\", etc., shouldn't ever be considered when choosing a place to visit.     Employees get busy, distracted, are given unreasonable demands, are insulted, and are sometimes way under-tipped or not tipped at all---often unfairly, out of spite.   THAT'S why he didn't have a full-on grin the entire time.  They're HUMAN, and unlike some diners who NEVER make them, workers might make mistakes for any number of reasons---maybe her father passed away recently or she just caught her husband cheating, or it's his FIRST DAY ON THE JOB.  Not the 100% attention and White House dinner service you expected?  Unfair.  Play fair, be patient, and give workers room to breathe.   ."}
{"text":"I love food. All types, barbecue especially.  There is nothing more fascinating yet delicious about the process in which food becomes barbecue. The slow cooking, the smoke, the time, the energy, and the heart all somehow combine with an artistic array of ingredients to make a food so good that your mouth waters just thinking about it.  Here at smokey bones you won't get any of that.  I'm at the point where I believe that there is nothing more detrimental to good food that mcdonalizing it and selling it in franchises.   Here at smokey bones that exactly what they've done.  You will find a wonderful selection of mediocre and soul-less dishes here, all served in heaping portions.  If you really enjoy this place, I question how you live your life. I know this is Ohio, it's not known per say for great BBQ. But any person who has emotion will know this is one sad thing that has happened here.  I got ribs, a full slab, with two sides. The ribs were supposed to be \"st.louis\" style, however they were not anything like st. louis style bbq. Plus the additional sauce they provide is even more lame, some how the sauce just tastes greasy more than anything. The ribs where cooked ok, a little tougher than what I know but they were cooked ok. The flavor was just terrible.   In short, this place is anti-food, don't go. It's lame."}
{"text":"I ordered \"to go\" catering for a party from the Smokey Bones website (North Olmsted, OH store), 11 days in advance.  I called to confirm the order about an hour before pick up and they didn't have it!!  Their comment was, \"I think we have the stuff to make it\".....no apology or anything.  The ribs came with each slab individually saran wrapped, which was a messy and unnecessary.  For what you get, the price (and service) is outrageous."}
{"text":"We went here for my boyfriends birthday dinner last night. This is one of his favorite places to go to twice a year or so. I originally ordered a passion lemonade, which I have never tried. I wasn't crazy about the taste. Luckily we had a super friendly waiter who understood and took that off our check. She gave me a fruit punch instead which was very nice! We ordered the fries as an appetizer and these were great. I ordered the build your own burger which had Mac and cheese on it-this was delicious! My boyfriend ordered the combo special, with St. Louis ribs and beef brisket. He was real jazzed about the brisket and said it was one of the best he has ever had! He loved the entire meal minus the cole slaw. It was lacking a bit. We had a great time and will definitely be returning. It wasn't very busy on a Wednesday night and the food took a little while to come out-that is our only complaint. Our waitress was friendly and very accommodating. Management came around to see how our meal turned out as well, which was nice. Can't wait to return again to try something new :)"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times. Food comes quick and tastes great! This time going our server was outstanding! Our manager had to come over to us during our meal and was extremely rude and disrespectful! He ruined our experience!"}
{"text":"We went here on the day after Christmas, and it was a great experience. My husband and I split a meal, and they brought it on separate plates...even going so far as to split up the piece of bread. Our food was delicious, and the service was fantastic. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Always good. Love Smokey Bones! Great wings! Good chicken nachos! Not a fan of the buffalo chicken dip. They use breaded chicken and more blue cheese topping than I like."}
{"text":"We ordered the nachos which were awesome.  They are in my opinion HOW nachos are supposed to be.  Ample cheese, salsa, cheese on almost every chip, and a dollop of sour cream.  I ordered a burger medium rare.  On the second bite I confirmed that 75% of the burger was raw and not cooked.  I would easily classify it as rare, the absolute minimum that you can serve ground beef at with a sear on the exterior.  I told the waitress that it was under-cooked and she took it back to the kitchen.  Either the manager or the expediter came out and discussed it.  She said it was perfectly medium rare, I disagreed.  The subtle difference between medium rare and rare is up for debate...  I did not like the fact that she said I was off on the ordering of it but she took it back.  The burger that was returned was WELL-done.  That irked me a little since all I wanted was a little pink in the middle, not beef jerky.  And the original order was no onions...this had them.  No big deal.  The napkin roll had a dried piece of something in it...pretty sure it was a jalapeno.  Did it kill me?  No..but that coupled with the under-cooked burger, over done fries and onions on the replacement sucked.  To her credit she removed the burger from the bill.  This saved my opinion of this place and will give it another try.  And also because the nachos were a 9/10 in my humble opinion.  Wait staff is attentive and quick to rectify any issues.  The bartender makes solid drinks and listens to requests like \"easy on the sweet and sour\".  I also see efficiency from the hostess to ordering to fixing the order to refills to getting the check."}
