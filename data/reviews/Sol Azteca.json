{"text":"We dined here for lunch. The service was lightning fast and very cheerful. The chips are hot and the salsa is flavorful and of the puréed (not chunky) kind. We had chicken fajitas and chicken Jalisco (spicy strips of breast covered with cheese sauce) and a chile relleno. The cheese sauce was outstanding, the chicken hot and fresh and cooked to order. The rice and beans were pedestrian, about what you'd expect. The guacamole was fresh and hot--it had jalapeños. The bright orange decor was super cheerful on this cold winter day. A nice effort from this place that has been here for 18 years (early years as Casa de Fiesta)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food in town great service and fast I love it. Awesome decor and the painting on the exterior is fantastic. Go see for yourself you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The last few times eating here it has been less than desirable for me. Today though, my boyfriend agreed with me that the food has just not been as good lately as it was with the previous owners. Even the chips & salsa wasn't good...how do you mess that up at a Mexican joint? Unfortunately, not sure when I'll be back next. Sad because this was one of my favorite places to eat when in Rantoul."}
{"text":"The business changed owners. When I went there last time I asked for the guy that usually works the Cash register. The new owner told me he was on break. Later I found out my friend had been let go and was living in a different state. I also believe the food is no longer made there. So one star from me for lying and Bad food. Gave them another chance believe there was a language barrier that caused the previous problem."}
{"text":"Delicious fajitas!    Consistently good - not sure why some of the reviews are extremely negative lol?   New staff and recently they cleaned up and remodeled - looks good!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was pretty dang good! Stopped by on a random exit on our way to Chicago and craved Mexican. Checked help and found this joint. Pretty decent crowd for lunch! Waiter was great and very attentive.  We started with queso - YUM! - and jumbo Margs. Also YUM. Hubby got lunch special  #4 : taco and enchilada the with rice and beans. Good but those beans were so good. I got the lunch fajitas because I'm a creature of habit and wow. These are good. They had this delicious sauce and the flavor was awesome. Definitely a solid spot."}
{"text":"Stopped by after visiting a friend and Mexican food sounded good.  Yelp recommended this first and we were .2 miles away.  The chips and salsa tasted amazing and their chili con queso was great as well! I also appreciate that they give everyone their own salsa. The atmosphere is just like all other local Mexican restaurants, but the staff were super friendly and personable.   My husband ordered the El Vallarta-which is chicken, steak, and shrimp covered in a cheese sauce all over rice along with a guacamole salad.  They provide tortillas, which is nice but not necessary.  My husband didn't even use his.  I ordered a \"build your own\" combination with a tamal, tostada, and chile relleno with rice and beans.  Th And tostada was okay, i probably wouldn't order it again.  Nothing too special...but their relleno and tamal tasted amazing.  The tomato sauce covering them had a little spice and the flavor was phenomenal.  For all of that food plus a peach daiquiri and corona it only cost us $32.  If in town, this is definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Illinois. The service is fast. The food is great. The whole family loves coming here. It is great for takeout, too."}
{"text":"My neighbor who I trust VERY much told me that she was charged 2.00 for carry out even though she had never been charged before for the same service. When she was told that they would look into it and call back, she still hadn't heard.  Any business that tries to sneak extra fees gets one star! SOL AZTECA HACE FRIO!!!!"}
{"text":"Still no liquor served after several months.  Food was horrible.  This place needs a good cleaning.  Won't be back.  Very sad after coming here several times and enjoyed the food.  Service is still good.  They have forgotten to focus on the food.  And why did they lose their liquor permit???"}
{"text":"Margaritas , yum , steak , chicken and chorizo , all good , oh and the margaritas.  Real traditional Mexican food , Ben there for years and will for years to come"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened, and never had a bad meal. The service is friendly. I'm surprised anyone gave Sol Azteca 1 star. The place is always clean, the menu is standard Midwestern Mexican food, the prices are good; Lunch Fajitas are $7.50, and very filling. Overall, a 3.5 star rounded up to 4 stars to counteract those ridiculous 1 star reviews."}
{"text":"I've been coming here while in town for about 6 years now. Eat dinner here about 5 times per year. Decent food, not the greatest looking from outside. Ice cold Dos Equis Amber beer in 32 ounce frozen mug for $4.25 goes great with dinner. Dinners run $6.50 to $10.00 from your generic combinations of burrito's, tamale's, taco's, enchilada's to the VERY good Carne Asado which is an 8 oz. ribeye steak with all the fixin's. Great service and quick with more salsa or another drink."}
{"text":"We are here for lunch 30 mins after opening. Beans are runny and tasteless and rice is Spanish-rice colored yet totally tasteless. Service however, was amazingly quick and I have always loved their salsa. Server doing an AWESOME job taking care of us!! Enchilada and soft taco were good."}
