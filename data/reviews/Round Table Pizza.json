{"text":"It was pretty good. Wish they had more spicy pizza selections. At least pepperoni and jalape√±os."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see that this Round Table reopened recently after been closed for a while.  I used to come here about once a month for the lunch buffet as I work nearby, and I will have to start coming back now.  The lunch buffet is $6.99 for AYCE pizza, salad bar, and cinnamon twists.  Not a bad deal for a quick lunch!  Glad to see you're back Round Table!"}
{"text":"Went to their lunch buffet, was impressed by the selection of the salad bar, the only thing I wish they have is some soup. Pizzas really tasty & full of toppings, they do get their pizza line well stocked with decent choices! Only if they have more dessert pizzas. For the price it's well worth it, especially Vegas doesn't have a real pizza buffet, we have Cicis! They also have a dinner buffet on Tuesday for the same price! I'd say they need to have more advertisement to get more business 'cause a lot of people doen't seem to know about it."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Bay Area eating Round Table Pizza and as a result I am biased. To this day I still think RTP is the BEST pizza you can get - from a pizza chain restaurant anyway. The prices are a little higher for a pie here compared to other chain's - but like anything - you get what you pay for. The toppings are fresh and flavorful, and the bake is just right for my tastes. My favorite pie here is half and half King Arthur's Supreme/Wombo Combo. Ill take an RTP pie ANY DAY over Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Murphy's, Little Caesars, etc!"}
{"text":"Always great pizza. Liz was awesome! Even when one of her employees (I'm assuming she's a lead) made a mistake, she went out of the way to fix it gave me a small discount and offered me a beverage while I waited. If she's not a lead she should be."}
{"text":"Like the previous reviewer I also remember coming here as a kid and I was quite happy when I stumbled upon this location last year.  Yeah it's a chain but there's something about their pizza that is, well, good.

I've only been here for the lunch buffet, $5.99? Heck yes! Well right off the bat I'm in a good mood because I didn't pay much and if I got there before 12:00 there probably aren't many other people there. After paying and receiving two plates and a drink cup you slide to the left and survey the salad bar. It's no strip sized salad bar, but for it's lack of square footage it makes up in selection. Then slide over to the pizza. Like any pizza buffet they just keep bringing out different pies. That's whats nice about the buffet you get a little of each. Of course there's always some jackass taking 10 pieces for himself of which 5 he'll actually eat so he can throw the other 5 away. So stay on your toes, if it's busy it could be hard to get a pizza you want if you're a picky eater. 

They also offer garlic bread twists and cinnamon twists with glazing. I really like frosting and the sad thing here is that they don't put much on, and because the twists are so hot the frosting usually melts off and drips to the bottom of the basket :( 

What a great place to gorge yourself on the cheap and then roll your carcass back to the office to schlep off the rest of the day while your food coma slowly digests itself away."}
{"text":"Round Table is my absolute favorite pizza of all time. I drive from SW Vegas to go to this pizza place. The dining room is clean, the kids area is always cool and clean, and the folks who run it are always helpful. Met the owner once and he was friendly, and open to suggestions!"}
{"text":"the staff is awsome! the pizza is extraordinary!! damn good pizza! if you ever go be sure to get the wings with the king author supreme and the ranch!!"}
{"text":"Bringin back child hood memories! I grew up in Tahoe and the Round Table there was Excellent! Very helpful as I am outside their delivery area! These folks are excellent!"}
{"text":"So glad this place is back OPEN! They have the best pizza ever! Lol. The KING ARTHUR with skinny crust is the best pizza in the world!
My boyfriend ordered from Pizza Hutt & Dominos before and their pizza doesn't come close to yours.
I order delivery but gotta check out your salad buffet special $6.99 that's a great price :-)
Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Five out of five stars hands down noooooo questions asked!!!!  This place is the real deal. They should re-name it Real Deal Table Pizza!  The staff here literally goes two infinitity and beyond!!!!  They make sure you are satisfied from the pizza to the salad to the cheese twists, to the cinnamon twists, to the weasels, the wazzles, well you get my point.  They TAKE CARE OF YOU.  GREAT FOOD, GREAT STAFF, AMAZINGLY CLEAN RESTAURANT.  Hats off to you RTP and staff.  Keep up the exceptional work and food..."}
{"text":"It's not often you get 5-star service from inexpensive casual dining, but I must applaud April, the Manager, for providing such a great experience. I brought in the young daughters of some friends because their family has faced some really tough personal challenges lately and the kids needed some fun time. April went out of her way to make them feel welcome and special. Of course the pizza was great, and the girls loved it, but even better was how happy they were when we left. A+!"}
{"text":"I have family in Las Vegas and we live in Arizona where, unfortunately, there are no Round Table Pizzas. So we make it a goal each time we are there to stop at this location and get our fix. Unfortunately, this time we placed an order for pick up about 45 minutes prior to closing  and only after we got home realized that the order wasn't right. They had closed by then but I called the next day and spoke with the Manager, Liz. She was AWESOME she replaced the order the next day for us after finding out it wasn't right. This is customer service at it's finest and more retailers need to jump on board and remember what it is about! Thanks LIz!"}
{"text":"Was my first time visiting the place upon moving out here. When I first walked in I was immediately turned off as to how dirty the place was, food on the floor, unclean tables. Since i was meeting other people there i decided to stay and paid the buffet price. Had to ask to have a table wiped off. When I went for pizza there was only 4 slices available. The woman apologized and stated there are only two of us working. Poor excuse, hire more people. The salad bar was so disgusting i wouldn't eat anything from it. There are way too many places to eat in Vegas so I won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Anybody who is from the Bay & the South Bay know how hella good RT is!! 

RT has been my favorite pizza place ever since I was a lil kid growing up in San Jose. It is well worth the price, in my opinion! You pay for quality. Lol, my only real beef with them is that they serve Pepsi. Boo!! Such an inferior product to go alongside a superior pizza. But, back in the day, most of the owners used to serve Coke, but Pepsi was a much cheaper alternative for them, which was explained to me by many an owner ;) Pepsi, cheap? Imagine that! 

Anyways, back to the pizza...always fresh ingredients & they are not cheap with the toppings. Very tasty crust & delicious sauce! When I lived in North town before, I used to drive quite aways to eat at the one on Craig. Now, fortunately I live down the street from the Lake Mead one, that just reopened. But, this was the location me & Nicki G. had been getting our RT fix from & still do from time to time. Even when I lived on Oahu, which has 2 RT locations, I used to drive all the way from the North Shore to Waikiki to get my fix!! Please believe, I'm dedicated ;) 

Overall, this location is legit! & most of the locations offer an awesome lunch buffet. So, if you live close by & have never had RT, just give it a try. & definitely try the Garlic Parmesan Twists! They truly are, one of the last honest pizzas :D 

My faves: 

King Arthur Supreme 
Guinevere's Garden Delight 
Maui Zaui & the Hawaiian 
Mushroom & Olive"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the buffet this past Tuesday. 

I was very disappointed guys! I had been craving the buffet for weeks, since it had been a while since I had been in. FAIL! 

We came in a little before 1 & left close to 2. In that entire time, not another pizza was put out. The same 2 1/2 pizzas that were sitting there when we arrived were there until we left. 

Come on guys, I didn't come here to fill up on salad! Definitely did not get my money's worth this day. Looks like I'm gonna have to try out the Sahara/Fort Apache buffet, seeing as how I am in between both locations. I would hate to have to do that, since my loyalty lies with the Lake Mead location."}
{"text":"Love the Buffet, they even have a calendar for lacks favorite so you know what day your favorite pizza will be highlighted on he buffet!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints in town. The cinnamon twist are to die for . there's never a problem with customers service.  I love that they have multiple choices for vegetations. and multiple sauces white and red. I LOVE it. Not the same boring pizzas all the time."}
{"text":"Took an hour and a half to get a large pepperoni  pizza, a small Hawaiian and 16 boneless wings. When they arrived the pizzas crust was a little burnt, but the biggest disappointment-the chicken. They looked like burnt nuggets and the size of some of the \"boneless wings\" we're incredibly small. It was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I had The Garlic Pizza which was tasty. The Service was ok. Other than that I think this place is average."}
{"text":"Literally every time I have called in an order for pick up, it is either not ready or not even placed. EVERY TIME!!! I kid you not. I just placed another order on my way home and guess what? They have no record of the order. At least on previous occasions the person at register did apologize, this guy just stared at me like I was nuts and made no apology. They seriously need to get their act together."}
{"text":"I love the Guinevere's Garden Delight pizza! Toppings are a perfect compliment to the crust and sauce."}
{"text":"Will always be my favorite pizza place. I grew up in the Bay Area (Vallejo, CA) and round table is my childhood! Thank goodness vegas has one. I always order the King Arthur supreme, no sausage, add pineapples. Sometimes I get the chicken garlic too. My boyfriend loves their plain pepperoni. Great service. Will always come back."}
{"text":"I love love love this place ! Honestly the best pizza place in town ! The employees are great especially Jennifer, such a nice girl with a killer smile, and I just can't get over the chicken BBQ pizza ! I recommend this place to everyone !"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza of all time, way better taste than pizza hut & the wings I can eat 100 of them in one sitting there so good."}
{"text":"The food is so amazing at this place that we make over a half hour drive to this location just to get Pizza, the flavors are wonderful, and are absolutely amazing, and if I was grading just on that it's a 5 star pizza joint. The Garlic Twists are good enough I'd drive to another state if this place ever closed down for. 


For our normal order, we ask for it be lightly baked, basically meaning, don't burn our pizza/twists. Normally their employees understand and we get a great meal worth driving across town for.....



However it's been completely random the level of service for everything else about the restaurant though.


There's been times where the employees are just lackadaisical, the food eventually gets to us, and with no flair or care about anything we've ordered.

Sometimes employees just seem to be lacking a work ethic, tables needing a quick scrub down, salad bar needing to be cleaned up, etc

And once we were directly insulted for our order lied to about our order just having shown up in their system, even though we had ordered it 20 minutes prior, and claiming they could never make our order how we've ordered it from years from multiple locations.

The lady snarked at us that they could only do it if we wanted to get sick. We looked in disbelief and figuring we'd probably getting burnt piles of dough if we stayed we canceled our order and went and got pizza from a place that knew how to lightly bake their pizza."}
{"text":"It was just happenstance that I was in the area to look for something else, decided to eat at Teriyaki Madness, and in the process discovered this Round Table; so glad I found this.

Formerly from Central CA, from TX, and originally from So Cal, we had two of these in our town and since moving here in June, I missed their pizzas terribly. They're pricey for a chain and they're a distance away from where we live in the NW. But it gives me a good reason to stop by the area to get an XL King Arthur's Supreme."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. I had to clear out a table just to have somewhere to sit. Our pizzas sat on the counter for 20 minutes so they were cold by the time they made it to our table. Never again."}
{"text":"Never going back over priced burnt piece of crap with no sauce."}
{"text":"The dining area looks like an employee break room at BigLots. and the decoration on the walls are wiring and extension chords hidden by an inexperienced do-it-yourself-er. But they STILL get 4 STARS. I explained to the lady that I had a $30.00 budget and proceeded to order 2 small pizzas for almost 30 dollars. She suggested for me to get an extra large and do a half and half pizza. I ended tripling the amount of food and was still able to get bread twists and chicken wings as well. 
My wait was only 10 minutes, but she offered me a drink while I waited. 
People- THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!
Shannon was the lady's name, and this is the kind of service that  guarantees repeat customers. There was a tip jug at the counter and that usually tells me, \"I'm just gonna do my job and nothing else- gimme your change.\" But Shannon made me wanna go back home and get my check book. 
Red Robin, Denny's, BJ's , etc. Go here, and take some notes. If you think I'm under-tipping you, it's because you only know how to serve food. You don't know how to keep customers. When your mentality gets to this level, then you will be earning my tips."}
{"text":"This was some of the best pizza I've ever had.  We tried the Montagues meat marvel which was really good and a pepperoni pizza which was amazing!

Service was fast and friendly. 

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"each and everytime my family and I order from here the order is correct, the service is fast aand the pizza is yummy. My only complaint is always order too much and we end up freezing it and never eating it :) so we have to order again lol"}
{"text":"Pay this Round Table location a visit!!!! Five stars, nothing less.

Went here on my birthday last Friday, May 12. Arrived around 9 pm, maybe a few minutes after that. First, I just want to say- fantastic service from ALL the employees working that night. They were very nice, welcoming, and that to me just makes my dining experience all the more better. 
 
Went with my daughter's and we ordered two large skinny crust Italian Garlic Supreme pizzas, soda,  and an all you can eat salad for me. DELICIOUS!!!! All of it. I love Round Table pizza, but since we've moved, we no longer qualify for their delivery services because we're outside of their delivery range. It's kind of far from where we live, so we don't get out there much but it was my birthday and we had to made it happen!!!! Couldn't be more pleased with the service, the food, the cleanliness of the ENTIRE restaurant. It was perfect. And I speak so highly of the customer service because good treatment is sometimes hard to come by with many restaurants. So when I find an establishment whose employees provide exemplary service, well I just have to show my appreciation by telling the world!! Yes, it's that serious. Oh, and also, I must mention how even though they closed at 10pm, we were there past that time just laughing and having a good time, and we were not rushed to leave. Outstanding staff!!! Thank you, Round Table!!!!

Anyways, the food was amazing!!! I'm telling you, Vegas doesn't know that Round Table is one of the best Pizza chains out there!!! I know this because my home state is California and trust and believe Californian's know what's up with Round Table!!! 

I've provided pictures for you all, but really y'all just need to check them out."}
{"text":"Have decent place. It's a good change of pace from Pizza Hut and Dominos. I would record you give it a try. I had a personal pepperoni pizza for lunch and enjoyed it. Not something to go out of your way for but if you're in the area why not?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza chain restaurants. I remember going to Roundtable pizza plenty of times as a kid in California. Great memories. I love the pizzas here because it has a great crust. The sauce and ingredients are very tasty. I always get the King Arthur's Supreme and it never disappoints. The chicken wings are also pretty good. The only place I like better than this place is Shakey's."}
{"text":"They have a lunch buffet, there was a fellow on the corner of Ft. Apache and Sahara touting it and I'm sorry I went. In my youth this was the last honest pizza, real cheese and delicious meats and crispy but yeasty doughy crusts. The salad bar was three star with better than average lettuce but the dressings were awful, oily and not flavorful. The pizza was all thin crust, burnt or well done and not as good as I remember. The cinnamon crust desert was ok. Life is too short to get a Cici's experience at what should be a better lunch experience. Sadly, my feeling this place was on it's way out and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Worse service in the world it took 1 hr to get a pizza  yea JUST ONE MEDIUM PIZZA !! 
people that ordered after me got their food fast! 
Smh and the employees are just talking and laughing in the back 
When I finally received my food it was cold
And then i asked for my ranch, then he walked back and started talking to his coworkers and forgot about my ranch. YOU HAD ONE JOB. Smh at the night crew i bet if i ask for a friggen togo box it'll take them 20 min to get one lmao"}
{"text":"I dont know why such a low rating. Ive been here a few times for the lunch buffet, and its great. Ive even requested specific toppings, and the staff was more than happy to oblige. Even when ordering to go the staff is really nice. Should just update the place a bit, but not a bad place overall."}
{"text":"Round Table is a nostalgic place for me. We used go there after high school football games or other times when it was our \"go-to\" pizza place in town. And their pizza was good with that nice crispy thin crust. This was in California. So I was very happy to find it here. The pizza for the most part tasted the same, but I've found other pizza places that I  like. The biggest turn off there was the lack of customer service. Twice when I went there no one was at the counter for a while. Another time the guy making the pizza in the back was on his cell phone. That's just gross. However, I read they changed, so I might give them another try."}
{"text":"Round table had a pretty decent lunch buffet reasonably priced at 6 bucks the only down fall was they would lag on keeping fresh pizza available. Went there again last week and they raised the price and now it doesn't include a drink. For about $ 10 now I think I'll pass."}
{"text":"Our family first time here for sum late lunch. Pizza is good but service not... They don't acknowledge you when ur ready to order. Not a single word from the cashier. I didn't know if she was ready to take my order or not... there was one more family besides us but we still had to look for a table to sit at because most had dirty plates on them..... good pizza but we probably won't be back.... very poor service...  just not a good first time experience.... go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Out of all the chained pizza place, this place is the best. Little pricey but they make the pizza to perfection."}
{"text":"Being from Northern California.....missing having Round Table Pizza.  My favorite thin crust pizzzzza"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, staff was OK, but the non-existent air conditioning was horrible....especially for a children's birthday party. According to one staff member, the owner is too cheap to get proper air conditioning and it's like that all the time. I don't know how the staff was working in the kitchen with all the ovens going. Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner buffet on Tuesday night and was so happy to see they were showing Movies in their banquet room for kids. It kept my 4 year old occupied while he ate. The night I was there was Lego movie. The total for me and my son was about $15 including drinks. Selection of pizzas was great. The biggest draw for me is the salad bar. It's a big salad bar with a lot of selections of fresh veggies. They have 3 different lettuces to choose from which I love."}
{"text":"Came here for my daughters 13th. The pizzas were a nice size and delicious! We also had boneless BBQ WING and poly wings(tasted like sweet and sour wings) and some garlic bread twists. It was not busy at all, probably because it's Sunday and everyone is at home watching football and ordering out. The servers were nice and polite and brought everything we needed and there's a tiny, and I mean tiney, arcade room with like 10 games in there to keep the kids busy for a bit. Definitely going to come back for more pizza and maybe some cinnamon twists!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is unorganized.  8 employees, with only 1 taking orders.  When they did get around to taking the order, the pizza came out with the wrong toppings.  Too bad, because Round Table is my favorite pizza place but i will not be back again."}
{"text":"Have loved Round Table Pizza for as long as I can remember. Last week I took my grandchildren and elderly parents for dinner. We didn't stay long as we couldn't stand the music. It was rap with lots of inappropriate language, and it was loud. We got boxes and took our food home. Don't think we'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went to Round Table to try it out and I doubt I'll go back.  The place was DIRTY!!!!  I understand it's Mother's Day and you were probably busy, but when I see 3-4 teenagers standing around while 3/4's of your restaurant's tables are disgusting, it annoys the shit out of me!  The guy who took our order over charged us, wasn't very pleasant and seemed annoyed that we called him out on his mistake.  I got the salad bar and it was so limited in options.  The spinach, iceberg and romaine lettuce was wilted, brown or barely holding up.  Most of the toppings were almost gone if not completely gone, but I managed.  The pizza took FOREVER!!!  I understand pizza takes a while, but 40 minutes?  We finally asked for a to go box at the same time that kid who gave us attitude was bringing it to out table.  We again got attitude for the apparent inconvenience, but we gave no attitude for the shit experience.  The only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is bc the teenage boy who brought our pizza back out to us in the box was super nice and seemed to be the only one who cared that anything got done in there with the slightest bit of hospitality.  Got the pizza home, which I literally live 1/4 mile away and it was cold.....but it just got out of the oven?  After reheating in the microwave, it was okay. I've definitely had better.  I'm sure you can find better too.  To the owners and management, if you're gonna have a bunch of teenagers working in your establishment, I'd suggest having an adult manager present at all times and if there was one there tonight, YOU FAILED!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just stopped in for the lunch buffet. Its just down from my office. The server Leah, was very attentive and helped me order the buffet.  Which was very neat with fresh ingredients topped off. The pizza bar was being filled at the time I sat down and they kept it full with fresh hot pizza's the whole time I was there. The dinning area was kept clean and tables cleared on a regular basis as customers where leaving. I will be making this a regular stop in my routine for lunches while at the office. HealthMarkets agent suite 13."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? The delivery took over an hour, the pizza was awful and also cold. I do not recommend Round Table to anyone who likes good pizza. We were going to order from Red Rock pizza but my
Husband wanted this place. Never again! Absolutely terrible. We ordered the Supreme and the margarita pizza and both were awful."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been fans of  Round Table Pizza for decades.  The one on Eastern isn't really close, but we stopped in for lunch recently while in the neighborhood.  We didn't have the buffet but ordered a large King Arthur Supreme.  It was very good; love the slightly crispy crust.  Unfortunately this store is getting run-down looking; dirty bathrooms and floors, and even the ceiling tiles need some work/replacements.  It could use some help.  Can't fault the pizza, though :)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place and it's people. First of all, it has the best salad bar (and best price) within a 15-mile radius of my home. The staff is friendly, helpful, and management is always having promotions that make their prices (already very reasonable) even more attractive. Visit there - you'll be writing this review as well.

Their pizzas are a little bit on the high price but very good lots of toppings no complaints at all"}

HAHAHAH See, I told you I would do a yelp review.... sorry for the few day delay... but you are AWESOME !"}
{"text":"I have had this pizza delivered and it was delicious. One of the best I have ever had. 

This time, I went to the restaurant to pick it up. When they showed it to me, I noticed that some of the pieces didn't have any pepperoni. She offered to make a new one but I didn't want to wait that long. 

As soon as I took the first bite, I was extremely disappointed. It was mostly dough. Ended up throwing it away. 

I eat healthy most of the time, occasionally I like to have pizza but I doubt if I will try Round Table again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat pizza.When I eat here ,it brings back childhood memories of when we use to go to roundtables.People say Ny style or Chicago Deep dish are the best.They're good,but overall they can't top Roundtables in my book.My experiences and memories is what makes this place so good for me,and the pizza.:)"}
{"text":"I have many a fond memory of RTP in my home town when I was growing up.  It had ample space for various school and social functions, and outstanding salad bar, and a modest yet fun game room.  It was there that I discovered the King Arthur Supreme.  When I think of a solid tasty pizza that takes me back to the days of my youth, I think of this master piece. 

The KAS consists of Pepperoni, Italian sausage, salami, linguica, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, black olives on zesty red sauce (RTP website).  To this day, I still don't know really what linguine is.  I know....I can look up on the internet.  But I believe this is the magic ingredient (like something in the Coke recipe) that makes this a legendary pie.

When the time came to reintroduce calories to my body after an obstacle course race, this location and several KAS would be a fitting end to a glorious day.

Rolled and order up. Zac M. rolled in shortly after and ordered up.  The lady behind the counter was all smiles and happy to assist.

Sadly, the former beer taps sat dismantled.  But this was not the order of the day.  It was all about pizza which was served up in quick fashion.  It was simply marvelous to look at.  It tasted equally marvelous. The food coma was had by everyone except perhaps Zac M.  He may have been having the food coma version of a small pox episode because he broke out in the sweats.  After several minutes and his body regulating, his vitals returned back to normal.

The customer equivalent of ranch dressing came when the nice lady behind the counter stopped by to tell all to have a nice night.  Outstanding!  If barley soda was provided...it would have been a five star experience without a doubt!"}
{"text":"$41 for a Large Pizza and a 2 liter of soda?

And the pan pizza isnt as good as Pizza Hut for sure!

High prices....mediocre pizza, we will be back.   haha...Well, a friend wants to try it and so we told her we would go back with her, try a different pizza next time, make her pay for it.

It wasnt bad--service was good, the place wasnt clean at all."}
{"text":"Just got done eating with my family (party of 20), it was really sad & messed up to overhear an employee accuse another customer of stealing after the beautiful lady had to clear off a table just to sit and asked her to leave and not come back, claiming that Ray the manager had her on camera. I know my family and i will not be coming back after seeing that. It's a busy sat night with almost no place to sit or clean tables. We came in as the lady was clearing a table and an employee cleaned our tables. Rude how Ray and another employee wait til she started eating to ask her to leave, sounds fishy like Ray was looking for a motive something. She seems like a genuine &sweet lady when i asked her what that was all about, she stated she's had problems with certain employees so it makes sense that they were looking for a reason to ask her to leave. Like i told her there's plenty of better places to spend our money than to be treated like that and wait so long for the pizza."}
{"text":"My first time having Round Table Pizza was while I was out of town.  Little did I know there was a location close to home.  I decided to give it a whirl for lunch.  

During lunch hours they offer the pizza buffet for $6.99.  Pretty cheap lunch so why not try it out?  They have cheese stuffed bread sticks, small salad bar and about a half dozen pizza varieties.  Fairly good pizza but I wish there were more options like some of their competitors.  

I did enjoy their breadsticks.  I had to ask for dipping sauce though.  I wish they would have some out for guests.  The lady looked at me like I was crazy for wanting sauce.  I think she gave me the smallest cup she could provide.  Oh well.  

Service could be improved as stated before.  I also noticed dirty plates and tables weren't cleaned off right away.  I may have seen one guy make a round through the dining area while we were there.  For a buffet style lunch I don't think that is often enough.  

It's ok for lunch buffet option but I think they could do a tad better."}
{"text":"So I went back the other day because the manager had generously offered me a free buffet due to my previous visit.  I got there early before the lunch rush.  Everything was stocked, there were four pizzas out and they kept on coming. The staff and manager were very friendly - even asked me what type of pizza I wanted. The pepperoni and jalapeno pizza was the best.  What a difference from last time.  The pizza was delicious and everything on the salad bar was fresh.  The tables were clean and there were paper towels in the bathroom. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Four stars for chain pizza, say what?!  *record skip*
Round Table is from the Bay area and its fairly hard to find here. Boy did I feel like a doofus to realize there was one just five miles away from me. To be fair, it's kind of hidden in the back corner of a plaza...

I don't eat pizza too often, but when I do I want good crust and tons of toppings- Round Table is great for both of these things, which justifies their higher-than-average pricing (around $15 for a medium). Their sauce is nicely zesty without being too acidic, and their cheese is loaded on and real- not that tastless crap other places use. At 8 slices, a medium can easily feed two with leftovers, and I highly recommend the KING ARTHUR, with bell peppers, linguica, salami, Italian sausage, and more. It's like a classier version of your standard supreme pizza. 

Just a heads up, the pizza here is made fresh. If you come in and order, youll be waiting about 15 minutes for your pie- which is plenty of time to soak up their great music, featuring hits from the 90s, back when Round Table was originally popular! 

TIP: Join their e-club using the tablet at the register, confirm your phone number by text, and you'll get a code to use (immediately) for a free order of garlic cheese twists."}
{"text":"The best Pizza Chain in all of Las Vegas! Not only do they have the best Lunch Pizza Buffet in town at $7.99 but it's Unlimited Pizza, Garlic twists, and Salad! Great service and easy to find on the Corner of Warm Springs and Eastern Ave. Great tasting pizza!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love Round Table!!! Getting the Garlic Chicken and a Sausage Pizza! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Best chain pizza ever! I was so happy to find one in Las Vegas after growing up with Round Table in California. Great spicy pizza sauce and fresh ingredients. Reasonable prices. The lunch buffet is a favorite with my family because I can never order them enough garlic twists! Seriously though, try the garlic twists because they will change your life."}
{"text":"The Maui Zaui is basically a Hawaiian pizza on steroids! The Hawaiian pizza is my favorite. But the Maui-Zaui just knocks it out the park for me. It has everything a HP has and much more. Let's see... A sweet Polynesian sauce, crispy bacon bits, savory green onions, smokey Canadian bacon, red onions, mozzarella cheese and pineapples! I know it may sound a bit too much, but it's the greatest invention since tupperware.

They even have pizza buffets which includes a salad bar. It's great for family or big groups. There's a small arcade for children. The place itself might not be so pleasing to the eye, but just close your eyes while you eat the pizza. Orr take it to-go. Otherwise.. It's not too bad."}
{"text":"This location is NOT GOOD. There were black things that looked like bugs frozen in the ice served from their ice machine. When we notified the staff they tried to explain it as \"syrup corrosion\" and went on to say they have had some in their cups as well! The reason any restaurant would still serve people from a machine in which they are aware is corroded is beyond me. When we arrived, it looked like the pizza had been sitting out for a while, it was dried out and hard. If you are wanting Round table pizza I suggest going to the location on Eastern. It may be a further drive for some but it is more worth it and much cleaner"}
{"text":"I recommend the King Arthur Supreme with the white sauce it's so good. If your someone who doesn't care for red sauce. They also have a lunch special which is very popular. This is hands down the best  pizza chain for taste. price is higher but its matched by quality."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good! I like the pepperoni pan crust . I was so excited that they changed over to coke products.They almost always have a deal when you call. The customer service is exceptional. They want to make return customers..and it worked for me!"}
{"text":"So they have done the renovations... Meh... But the pizza was still spectacular! I am a thick crust pepperoni and cheese fanatic! When I get that evil crazy craving monster... This Round Table pizza is the one that makes the monster go away."}
{"text":"Yay!!! ROUND TABLE is Back!!! I was unhappy when they just closed!  Now they are under new management!  They now have coke products again!  Yay!  The pizza was just as good as I remembered!  The people there are really nice!"}
{"text":"My man and I love round table. It's hands down our favorite pizza BUT this location sucks. Every single time we order delivery from them. They wait an entire hour to hour 1/2 to call us to let us know they haven't even started our order and that it will  be another hour. With no apologies for their actions. Also, they need to fire whoever is cutting the pizza because it looks like a 5 year old cut it. Which is a complete pain when your having a party and someone gets a slice that's almost half of the pizza and another person gets a sliver. If there was another round table in the area we would honestly stop ordering from this one."}
{"text":"I came in at 9:40pm with 20 minutes to spare and lady refused me. She gave me the excuse of having been closed since 9pm since they were not getting any business. 

Clearly still open since the doors were not locked. 
Made me sad."}
{"text":"I personally did not enjoy their pizza. Not only is their regular sauce zesty, but the pizza as a whole was not good. Reheated was even worse and in fact not edible. I ordered in the restaurant, but took the pizza home. When I complained online they did not offer to reimburse me and they called me a liar. Terrible customer service from corporate."}
{"text":"Best Pizza ever. People here are friendly and kind. Whenever I want a different pizza, they gladly make it. 
Roundtable has the best flavor and if you like a veggie pizza the Guinevere is awesome. 
The lunch buffet is the best deal $6.99 for adults and $3.99 for kids. Drinks are extra."}
{"text":"I am a long-time customer and fan of RT.  I've been going there since preschool (Washing and Oregon stores, not this one).  It's been years since I've had it and I got a craving for it.  So last weekend, we decided to head down there.

The only reason I'm giving the RT two stars is because regardless of everything else, the pizza is very good.  I think as long as they stick to the RT recipe, the pizza will always be fine.  With that said, I am thoroughly disappointed in our visit.

When I ordered it took forever for the guy to understand my order.  It was a pan crust, half King Arthur Supreme, half Hawaiian... Not that difficult.  My wife was a little surprised at the price, but I told her it's fine.  RT is good and worth it.

While waiting for the pizza, we had the salad bar.  What a sorry excuse for a salad bar.  It's 2.5 feet of nothing.  Wilted spinach, a small variety of veggies, and three dressings.  I remember when the salad bar was ten feet long and included bread sticks... That is no longer the case.

They came out with a pizza in 15 minutes.  I thought that was pretty fast.  Well, it was screwed up.  It was a thin crust all meat pizza.  No where near what was ordered.  When I told the server that wasn't what we ordered, he said \"are you sure?\"  Really?  I think I know what I ordered, and there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, so there's no way he was mistaking us for another customer.  I told him what my order was and he took the pizza and left... with no apology.

50 minutes into our visit we still had no pizza.  I am a very patient person, but this was ridiculous.  I went to the counter to get my money back and saw the pizza coming out.  The cook asked what I wanted and I told him to give me the food I ordered nearly an hour ago... in a box please.

We got the pizza and enjoyed it, but the rest of our experience ruined our visit.  There are good locations and marginal locations, but I can't remember a bad visit before this one.  It's highly unlikely I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Showed up at Round Table on Lake Mead and was expecting to get the XL Large pizza Special BUT the guy who took our order said we needed a coupon.  I tried to explain that the last 3 times I got this special I didn't need a coupon it was just a Special...but the IDIOT with the tattoo on his right arm on kept on saying I cant give it to you unless you have a coupon....everything has a code everything has a code...bla bla bla....Instead of arguing I decided to suck it up and pay the 60 bucks fo the special that should have costed me $25 or $30 because I always come to the Lake Mead location and the owner was friendly. 

NOTE to the owner....What ever happen to the customer is always right? It was obvious he knew what I was talking about and you've given it to me the past 3 times with out printing anything Ohhhh but he did give us a discount of .27 cents for Seniors Discount on the XL Special.

Don't post a special if your not going to honor it...business 101

Here's the link see for your self 
http://www.roundtablelasvegas.com/specials.asp 

to the DUDE with the tattoo on the right arm....there is no coupon codes on any of your other coupons that have the dotted lines....and the XL Special is just a special...it doesn't show that you need to cut it out it's just a Special which the owner told me the last 3 times and I came home to look at the link to prove I was right...Get a new job where customer service isn't involved because you suck at it. What a FKN idiot  

Still give the Round Table 5 stars and nothing against the owner I just hate poor customer service. 

Feel free to contact me to give me the money back that I over paid."}
{"text":"I grew up on Round Table in Northern California (Bay Area) but as their pizza I still feel it's better than most chain pizza restaurants and even some MaPa places too. You may pay a little more but your getting a better quality pizza. Their other foods are great too and excellant salad bar.

Great experience overall, wish they had more in Vegas."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok.  Service was very slow even though the place was nearly empty with dirty tables all around.  This location does not have an alcohol license, soda only.  The amusing part was the bathroom, which had to be 110 degees with the one toilet taped off like a crime scene.  Ill skip this location next time."}
{"text":"Great service I was very pleased to decide to bring the kids here,  the food was good and everybody is very friendly ,not expensive. The cashier made a sugestion and Im happy he did because I wasnt sure about what to order but I want it something new, kids love it. Will be back and refer my friends too."}
{"text":"After closing then opening and closing again I wasn't even sure if this place was open. Luckily it was! I worked here when I was 15 it was my very first job and going in brought back alot of good memories ;) 

The lunch buffet runs from 11-2 weekdays and is fairly priced at 6.99 pp. It includes ayce salad bar, pizza and garlic parmesan twists which are deelish. We got there around 1130 so everything was hot and fresh the pizza was great and the twists were amazing as always. They even have cinnamon twists now which is an added bonus like a little sweet treat to finish off the meal. All of the employees were friendly and kept checking on us to make sure things were ok.

All in all I had a 5 star experience. However their speciality pizzas are pretty damn expensive so I probably would only go back for the lunch buffet as it seems to be the best deal."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this location anymore. The buffet is now only on Tuesday nights. I showed up around noon on Saturday for the buffet and was disappointed it was no longer. The girl who was helping me had just got done smoking a cigarette and didn't even wash her hands before helping me - gross. The menu used to be on the walls and when I inquired she told me they took it down because they just raised their prices. That's comforting! 

I ordered 6 of their cheese bread sticks which are called twists, and a small gourmet veggie pizza and it was around $25. The pizza was just as good as I remembered. It comes with their garlic parmesan sauce on your choice of crust, red & green onion, tomato, artichoke, zucchini, spinach mushrooms, cheese. It really is a yummy pie even though it has no meat. I also added pineapple on mine. The 6 twists come with one tiny cup of ranch and when I asked for more, it was an up charge which is extremely disappointing. This place is really expensive as it is and it's a fucking corporation. Stop nickel and diming customers. Give the people some ranch! The twists were very dry and lacked flavor. If I ever do come back it would be for the buffet only."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in town!!!!! Love your pizza buffet as well. Always fresh, good, and a bunch of variety.  My only hope is that you could extend the buffet till saturday."}
{"text":"A couple of days ago I stopped in for the Lunch Buffet and it was very good. There were was good selection of different pizzas as well as salad, garlic twists and cinnamon twists. It was all good."}
{"text":"This Round Table actually closed for awhile but is now re-opened and significantly better.  I think they changed out all of the staff so it's much more friendly and efficient.

Their pizza is expensive to me, but I do have to admit it's a step up from other places like Little Caesar's or Domino's.

The wings are gross, but everything else I've had here is pretty good.  The lunch buffet is a great deal if you can get there - it includes salad, pizza and the tasty cinnamon sugar twist things.

One of my recent favorites is artichoke pizza with creamy garlic sauce.  If you ask for well-done, they will actually leave the pizza in the oven just a bit longer so everything gets that nice layer of crisp to it."}
{"text":"It's so nice to go to a place where the management obviously cares about customers. Everything was clean and delicious. The lead supervisor, I forgot her name but it started with a C she was so nice. She made sure we had everything we needed. There was plenty of pizza out when we were here."}
{"text":"When I visited the woman working the cash register was very friendly and made sure I got ranch for my wings and packets of cheese and red pepper.  So the customer service was excellent.  The XL pizza is huge.  My Wombo Combo was piled high with toppings.  It was decent tasting but not outstanding.  The wings were a little bland and a bit dry.  All in all an acceptable meal but nothing outstanding.  I took my food to go but noticed the decor is a little bland."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online ,made my way down because the hubby was super hungry. Got there just so the cashier could tell me I couldn't use my hubbies debit card. Why not? Its just for a freaking 20$ pizza I wanted to pick up. 
I had to go all the way home, get him out of bed, AFTER just getting off work, haul him down there, JUST to swipe His card. When we got back the cashier who originally helped disappeared all of a sudden. We asked for a manager. And the cashier now handling us. Said she was making pizza at the moment .....we saw her RIGHT THERE ! Never once did she turn around to help the poor guy. We had them remake the pizza because it looked horrible . the entire experience is just too much for me to even type. In annoyed because of it, and we will never go here again. 

The Manager BTW was the chick with the HUGE back side."}
{"text":"I use to like this place because they had lunch AYCE specials for about $5, I haven't been here for about a year. But for some reason today it was around $10. I was already there so I just paid and expected greatness.  It was slow, for the lunch time, and not much selection to pick from, and it look like its been out for a while, all dry and hard.  I ate and took my time just to see if the new stuff would ever make it out.  They  did, half a pizza, but it was all watered down, light on the toppings real light on them. Weird restaurant layout, they have a huge eating area at least a 100 people but their food area was big enough to fit a soda machine, 2 pizza, and a small salad bar.  How would it be when this place is packed?  Then again I've seen places like this have fast service before so its possible. It may seem that Cici's pizza could have stole some of their business I  think they're about $3, never tried them yet. For $10 I could have gone some place better or at least gotten 2 little Caesar pizzas. Based on pass experience I won't rate them lower."}
{"text":"Top two pizza places in Vegas out of the casinos hands down. Always fresh always good"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza joint in Las Vegas.  I'm totally addicted to the Maui Zaui, worth every dime.  If you like crust that has those great bubbles in it, this is the pizza for you.  You'll never want to eat any other pizza after you've had Round Table."}
{"text":"Horrendous and overpriced. We came here hung over and the food was still terrible. We asked for a \"slice of cheese\" and the lady responded with \"we don't sell cheese, we have shredded cheese\". Really?!? You work at a pizza shop and dont know we meant cheese pizza?
The place was dirty and smelled funky. 
Worst of all, I bought a small Gourmet Chicken pizza and a soda and paid $17! Unreal. The pizza was disgusting. I can microwave a better pizza. And on top of that it took over 15 minutes to make after they (in their weird terminology) \"blew up their pizza. 
I have had amazing Italian pizza in New Jersey and can tell a good pizza. This place absolutely sucks and is priced like a top-of-the-line pizza shop. I wish I could give this place a rating of 0 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered extra large pizzas for a party.  They are not extra large they are just regular pizzas with tiny slices!  I even paid extra money for them!  Totally a rip off.  Never again."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery. It will take hours! I've ordered from them a few times and it's always always at least an hour and tonight it was 2hours!"}
{"text":"i had a groupon to the place, and not only was the staff a little sketchy (might have been because it was 10PM) but the food was nothing fancy at all, and there were A LOT of kids. it is a very cheap ghetto place to eat and was a tad scary to go to at night. LOL. although they did serve beer and that was a PLUS! was happy to see tat."}
{"text":"My honey and I came here for date night and it was good- hit the spot for our pizza cravings and the amount of food was good for the price.

We got a small (surprising, right?!) and a side of garlic Parmesan sticks. What I loved about the bread sticks is that they're twisted like ropes or braids and there are garlic and Parmesan pieces twisted and tucked inside the braid!

The small pizza was just enough for the both of us! We got half pepperoni and half King Arthur supreme. The King Arthur supreme was delicious as the veggies were nice and fresh and had a crisp bite to the bell peppers!

Staff were really nice and what I like about it is the food came out pretty quickly! All in all, if we are on this side of town again, we will pay a visit for our pizza cravings!"}
{"text":"Very good small pizza (pepperoni, anchovy, olives, mushrooms). Also had small order of chicken wings--right amount of hot spice.  Second time visiting in two months."}

And usually when I've been coming in Connor is helping me at the front counter and he does a fantastic job and is always helpful! And he also gets my order right every time! In my pizza is always amazing! Thanks Roundtable pizza and staff"}
{"text":"my first time here.  the people are really nice and help full. tv for sports....get your own set up at the table...
order online...and for me the place is clean"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Las Vegas (IMHO). They have the best pepperoni and their King Arthur Supreme is amazing. Their lunch buffet from 1100-1400 for $6.99 is a great deal and a great way to try lots of pizzas and toppings. If you ever see their Groupon deal it is well worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place was closed for a bit. Reading some of the other reviews I figured they took that time to fix those complaints because when I came here the carpet was no longer stained and the place did not smell like smoke.

With that said, I went with their 6.99 lunch buffet which used to be 9.99 before. I gotta say, the buffet choices were pretty solid. You get a full salad bar, garlic cheese and cinnamon bread twists, and most importantly, a variety of pizzas. The garlic cheese and cinnamon twists were really good! Both had lots of flavor and was not dry at all. The pizza was what it has always been. Lots of toppings. That's what RT is known for, generous portions of toppings. As for the salad. Come on man, nobody goes to a buffet to eat salad! But if I did, the choices were actually pretty good. Better than Cici's or Chuck E Cheese.

The only thing that kind of bothered me was that the same guy that held up their 6.99 lunch buffet sign was also their busboy. That part didn't bother me. What bothered me was that he did not have a Round Table uniform of any kind. He just had a plain button up shirt, shorts and sneakers. To me it looked kind of weird that he was walking around cleaning up tables when he looked like a regular customer. To me I thought that was kind of unprofessional. If you work for any company and are in plain sight of customers, you should have some kind of uniform that indicates you are an employee.

Some random info. Their 6.99 lunch buffet is available Monday through Saturday from 11 to 2. Drinks not included. They have other lunch specials that range from 6 to 9 bucks which includes sandwiches and salad.

Overall, the taste and quality that I have known from my trips to other Round Tables was still there. Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Airport dining options have come a long way over the past few years, sadly this Round Table Pizza is not part of that trend. After the server finished her cell phone call in the back room, I was treated to a slice of pepperoni pizza who's crust was almost indistinguishable from the paper plate it was served on. That and a domestic draft ran me about $8.50. Shoulda just gone with two brews."}
{"text":"First time eating at round table pizza. I will say the money spent on the all you can eat pizza & salad bar was worth it.
After 5 plates of salad & different pizza slices I will say I'll definitely go back to eat at this location again."}
{"text":"The pizza is solid but the wings are basically little dried chickens. The salad bar was small but had all of the basics needed to make a good salad. They keep the tables stocked with all the parmesan cheese and pepper shakers you could ever need. 

The decor is a bit... well I will be nice and just say dated. They could use a face lift. The arcade area is small enough to sustain a few kiddos for a while. They do allow you to control the televisions so that was a huge plus for me. 

The person taking our order offered suggestions which is always nice. She even helped us get the most bang for our buck. This particular night I had a tone of kids with me so i wasn't sure exactly what to order. We ended up going with a few large pizzas and some wings. I would say that the wings need some work, but the pizza was spot on."}
{"text":"*Not Honest Stay Away*

They dont honor your order even after charging your card. The franchisee is unresponsive and sets a poor example for the brand. 

Round table had a deal on their website for heart shaped pizzas so i placed my delivery order paid with my card and over a n hour later they call me to tell me they are not going fulfill my order and will refund my card in the next 3 - 5 business days. So now im hungry and have to change my plans for dinner and be short on funds in bank account until the funds return to my account.

They gave me the contact info for the franchisee but he has ignored contact attempts

I have emailed corporate hoping for a resolution"}
{"text":"Love the brand for years. I was lucky that the one franchise Vegas has is right across the street from me. Been there several times since they reopened the location to find that the pizza is still the same as I remembered. The customer service at this store is great. The workers are very helpful and will locate coupons laying around to try and lower your price. Even if you didn't ask for one. Very impressed with my experiences here and management should be very proud of their staff. They get the job done"}
{"text":"It would be nice when arriving for a delivery at a time that's different by 30 mins than initially stated, and calling from a random unidentified number, that a voicemail be left. I guess they wanted the pizza for themselves :/"}
{"text":"Ordered large pizza at 6:00 pm called at 7 to be told pizza left a while ago and should've there any minute. Called 30 minutes later and they said order 24 had it and they would call them but it would be better to call them direct? 

I went on yelp and found round table and ordered from them? I don't know who order 24 is but fine, they screwed up and next time I should call round table direct, EXCEPT !!! When my MEDIUM not large that I paid for shows up 1 1/2 hour after ordering the guy has a round table shirt on!! I ask him and he works for round table not eat 24!!

So Round Table screwed up and made a medium when I paid for a large, they blamed another company that had nothing to do with the delivery and even lied and said they called them and their driver was almost there!

So not only did you make a mistake on the size pizza and it took 11/2 hours but you couldn't admit to your service failure and blame it on eat 24.

This round table should be avoided and the franchisee should get control of his out of control pizza franchise."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal fan of RT since I worked at one in my early college days. No other pizza joint truly satisfies the way RT does.
The crust, the sauce, the toppings all make for a great pizza, but I don't think that corn meal is used on the bottom of the pizzas anymore and that is a shame. 
No, customer service is not the best, the carpets/seats are usually stained, and the tables are not cleaned as often as they should be. I go for the pizza, but the prices are outrageous in my book. We ordered one medium single topping and one small four topping and one drink and the bill was $30. With that kind of prices, a family would have to budget in a trip to RT instead of just dropping by on a whim. 
I have only been to RT once since moving to LV last year. Looks like it may be another year before I get back there."}
{"text":"Ordered Pizza @ 530PM it showed up at 635 a little later than I would have liked. It was still warm, I am 10 min from the place. Driver was nice even gave us peppers and parmesan flaky stuff. In the future I would dine in, but it was still good. Reminds me of my days living in the bay area."}
{"text":"I have been eating Round Table, since I lived in Half Moon Bay, over 30 years ago. I am normally a pepperoni pizza person, but I like linguica a lot. One thing I've always like about Round Table, is that linguica is available as a topping.

This location seems to open and close a lot. Always a Round Table pizza but it has closed and reopened twice since I've lived in the area. As I understand it, it  was franchisee changes. Regardless, I'm glad it's open again.

Enough of the history, back to the Yelp. I went there today for the lunch buffet, AYCE pizza, salad, garlic twists (think garlic knots, but different shape) and cinnamon twist.. With drink it's about $10. 

The salad bar has improved since I was last there, they have three kinds of greens, in separate pans, for the salad base. An iceberg lettuce with bits of cabbage, a Romaine and spinach, I had all three. Over a dozen toppings and probably 10 types of dressing. I don't think they make their own dressing, but the thousand island has always been great there.They also have potato and macaroni salads, I had the potato it was good and I'm picky about potato salad.

I was there at the beginning of the buffet. The first three pizzas they put up were vegetable, pepperoni and a combination (which included linguica). so I was happy. I had pepperoni and combination, both were very good. 

The garlic twists were good. There was enough garlic you could taste it, a little more would have been nice, but I like garlic a lot.  (I didn't see any vampires in the afternoon, so there must have been enough) 8)

I didn't try the cinnamon twists, I ate too much pizza. I had taken it for granted when it was open, then it closed and I missed it, it was the first time since it reopened, so I over ate a little. I will try them next time.

I don't really understand the relationship with pizza and cinnamon rolls, it's seems fairly new, but most of the pizza buffets have cinnamon dessert variations included now. I'm not saying I haven't had the cinnamon rolls at Graziano's or Cici's after eating pizza, I just don't understand the relationship. Maybe pizza dough and cinnamon roll dough are the same, so it's easy to do. I digress.

Anyway, if you haven't tried Round Table give them a try. If you haven't been to one in a while try this one, The lady running the place today was very proactive, making sure everything was okay, do you need anything, any particular type pizza you like so they could cook the closest one of their buffet offerings, etc.,"}
{"text":"I've heard alot about Round Table from Californians.  At first I was shocked that they charged $20 for a large pizza which would feed about 3 people.  For less, you can go to Dom Demarco's or Grimaldi's.

But I have to say that the Chicken and Garlic was quite tasty.  The creamy garlic sauce is really addicting.  I think it would be awesome if you get a side on the side to dip your pizza in - kind of like Papa John's.

What I like is that the crust on the bottom is crisp and the body of the crust has the nice chewy texture.  The crust experience was quite unique for a chain.  The leftovers were even better the next day.   My method is to nuke it for 30-40 seconds and finish it off on a cast iron.  It provides the same experience you have when eating there.

I'll be back for their Mon-Sat lunch buffet.  Without the use of a groupon, I don't know if i would go back outside of the buffet especially when I believe you can get much better value and experience at Grimaldi's or Dom Demarco's.

But the pizza here was still really good.  3.5 stars."}

Rex suggested that he lay down in traffic and wait for the pain to end. We compromised. Rex was able to huff gas right out of his tank, he paid, and Rex ate.


When you first enter Round Table Pizza the smell is surprisingly good.  Almost like good pizza.  Rex and his governmental guardian got the all you can eat and drink (soda not beer or ammonia, you can't even drink your own ammonia) and settled down for our feast. They give you two plates. One for the salad bar the second for the pizza. The booths are uncomfortable and tight.   Every gentleman knows that the first course is the salad course. Rex walked over to the salad bar and it was just all right. Nothing wrong with it. Nothing wonderful. Nothing memorable.  They had very good shredded cheese and excellent real bacon. Four or five dressings. Some other toppings. Not bad. Rex sits down, clears his throat for eight or nine minutes, blows two snot rockets and is ready to eat.  As expected the salad was okay.  It wasn't offensive and for the price Rex didn't pay, it was better than some salad bars for more money...and they don't have pizza.  The ranch dressing was above average. Not a bad start.

Rex reluctantly walked up to the pizza window.  There were two freshly baked pizzas and one that looked like it was made the year Betty White lost her virginity.  Rex took a few slices and sat down fully prepared to raise hell.  Sadly, Rex was not totally correct in his assumption.  The pizza while not great pizza, and if you made it in New York City someone would have you killed, wasn't horrible.  The first slice was a white chicken pizza with jalapenos.  Shockingly good. Rex was stunned. The second slice was a standard pepperoni and sausage with red sauce.  This is where the wheels start to fall off.  The red sauce is not good. It tastes like canned sauce you get on sale for 50 cents at some discount food store.  It had no real taste except for dried herbs and a little acidity.  The sausage was dreadful. No taste except for pepper and the pepperoni was bland.  Rex was unhappy, so he spit that crap onto the floor and went up for a couple more slices.  The white pizza with chicken, bacon and tomatoes was very good and the mushroom pizza with red sauce was dreadful. Over cooked mushrooms, no flavor.  

The one thing that should be said is that Rex has a huge Johnson.  The other thing that should be said is that the crust is surprisingly good. It is very buttery/oily but in a good way. It gets crispy and has a decent taste.

Round Table Pizza is exactly what it should be. It is a low cost option for people who don't know or can afford a good pizza. It is quick, easy, and cheap. The food isn't great, but it really isn't offensive either. If you haven't lived in the Northeast of the United States you have no clue what good pizza is anyway, so why spend more money on what is sure to be crap?  Get a salad, a drink and some pizza that is slightly better than frozen pizza for under 10 bucks. Fill your faces...nothing will make you forget Rex. Nothing will ever make that DNA test  will never be 100% accurate.  Hear the kid screaming? Hear Rex running? Of course you don't...Rex is long gone."}
{"text":"General Manager was nice enough to offer me a discount for my next purchase to try them again.  I did.  We had good food and a good experience this time.  I am not ready to give them more than 3 stars yet because my first experience was so bad, but we are moving up."}
{"text":"Of all my RT experiences, this one can't seem to get it right.

I'd rather pick up the pizza because getting delivery seems to always be a nightmare. I was hesitant on getting delivery today but bit my lip hoping they'd get it together...and I was missing dipping sauces. No biggie, but after getting wrong pizza's delivered, having previously waited 2 hours to have a pizza delivered (to which apparently was my fault??), to even reassuring that they CAN in fact deliver to my address (actually had to argue with a delivery guy who told me he wasn't allowed past the gates) -- It's just been a headache. 

Picking up both times for me has resulted in getting the right pizza experience. *knocks on wood*"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town.  Looking for a quick, enjoyable pizza after an all day volleyball tournament.  Found Round Table Pizza close to our hotel & decided to stop in.  Upon walking in, there was a party in the party room to the right & in the main part of the restaurant were about 12-15 children, unsupervised, who were evidently associated with the party in the other room.  The kids were screaming, yelling, running around, climbing up & over the booths, & sitting at clean tables pouring & mixing together the peppers, parmesean cheese, salt, & pepper.  They were completely out of control!  Parents did absolutely nothing to try to manage them.  We decided immediately that we'd order take out instead of dine in.  No one from the restaurant said anything to anyone associated with the party while we were there.  As we picked up our pizza, however, the girl at the counter asked if I was part of the party.  I told her I was not & that I'd wanted to dine in but I couldn't handle the noise.  She apologized & said they'd asked the parents at least 5 times to manage the kids & the parents just weren't doing anything about it.

Upon returning to our hotel room, we ate our pizza & garlic bread.  Then, this morning my daughter started throwing up.  Based on prior experiences similar to this, we believe she has food poisoning.  

All in all, a memorable experience but for all of the wrong reasons, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went here for the Pizza Buffet with some friends today.

For the buffet, which comes with a drink it came out to $6.48 with tax.

The place was busy and I can see why: A great value for the price.  

Only a few times the pizza counter was empty, but that was soon alleviated by an onslaught of fresh, hot pizzas.  The pizza counter also included garlic bread twists and cinnamon twists.

You can also partake of the salad bar that they have.

Fresh lettuce, vegetables and a good choice of toppings and dressings.

The staff is friendly and the place relatively clean.

The only negative was that my friends kept complaining how hot it was.  If you sit very close to the pizza counter, it is very hot in the back.  I suggest sitting in the main dining area or closer to the front of the store where their are ceiling fans."}
{"text":"We tried this place out because we had a groupon. Honestly, I'm glad we waited because I was not impressed by this place at ALL. 
The place was pretty decent looking, I'll give it that,  but the bathroom smelled REALLY strongly of urine. I understand people are nasty, and that's not the restaurant's fault, but you still have to clean it out. 
Anyways, the counter guys were really, which is the only reason I can give this place two stars. We ordered a ridiculously expensive medium with peperoni and mushrooms.
First off, some women brought their seven screaming kids in for dinner. I swear to god, they must have given these kids donuts and a two liter of mountain dew each before they left for dinner. Screeching, using people's chairs as a jungle gym, beating and kicking the gaming machines, all while the mommy's sat there like fools noshing on their pizza. This isn't at all the restaurant's fault, but as soon as they left more screaming, destructive kids came in, so I think you might want to get carryout if you end up coming here. 
A  girl finally comes out and brings us our pizza and she's actually wandering off when I call her back to get us some plates... Seriously.. Do you think we DON'T need plates? She finally brings that back and I realize we still don't have forks and knives. Whatever, I go hunt that down and bring it back to the table.
The pizza: The bottom of the pan crust actually tastes sort of like a saltine cracker.. Even looked a little like one.. Weird, but otherwise a completely unremarkable crust. The sauce tasted like the cheapo special junk you can get at the grocery store. The cheese was good at least and they used plenty of it. The peperoni and mushrooms however weren't really good. 
Overall, overpriced pizza with mediocre quality. Next please!"}
{"text":"Came here for some pizza at a friend's party. The area they have for celebrations is pretty nice. It's got a decent amount of tables and chairs and an arcade basically a few steps away from that area. The games consisted of your usual arcade things: there was a basketball game, two claw machines, a motorcycle game, flaming hot fingers, stack it, and some other game about rocking an iceberg side to side to get a ball to the top. 

Overall, the pizza tasted pretty nice--extremely cheesy! Their garlic twists were absolutely amazing, though I didn't particularly like their marinara sauce. There's a decent amount of options for drinks as well and I enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza you'll find.  I've been going to these chains since I was a kid from AZ, WA, Cali and now Nevada.  They Round Table has a large variety of specialty pizzas which are amazing.  My personal favorite is the Italian Garlic. If you are not looking for anything fancy they have the regular stuff to which is just as good. Their sauce is very unique and fresh toppings makes it a great experience, not your typical pizza. I also recommend their garlic Parmesan twists. The chain and food is five stars. 

This location though there are some complaints.  The last few times
I've gone the AC is never turned on making it feel like a jungle inside. I probably will never dine in here again given it was not a one time fluke. Their buffet is very small.  They have a couple medium pizzas out at a time. You can not get full bread sticks. They cut each stick into fourths so you can't take as much. They also do not put wings on the buffet which stinks.  On top of all this you have to eat in the sweltering heat of the dining room. 

They have a great product so it's worth eating but i suggest you take it to go and avoid the buffet. I also hate how places like this charge for ranch when you spend 15 bucks on a pizza. I can see if Pizza Hut charges but expensive gourmet pizza this is a insulting charge.  RTP is five stars but I have to give this location 3. Needs better leadership."}
{"text":"I want this to be my last meal. The King Arthur Supreme at Round Table has been my favorite pizza all my life. And I've tried others. I even saw a lady in round table that had two pizzas in front of her I said, \" boy you look like you're really going to enjoy yourself\". she looked at me and she said ,I need some comfort food because that flood flooded out my car my home and my house and I have nothing and I want to eat this to make me feel good.  I just smiled. Patted her on back and said do what makes you feel good. least you know where your good places"}
{"text":"I have  always loved Round Table.  It had always been a great chain.  So, I ordered a large pepperoni a couple months ago.  I went to pick it up and they forgot to cook the order.  I was in a hurry and had to pick up my son.  They suggested that I could wait 15-20 min. Was not possible.  They told me that they would give me the same order next time for free.  They were going to write my name in the book and I could get it at another time.  So, I ordered the pizza last night.  Spoke to a young girl (very nice and tried to figure out the pizza situation).  She finally found my name in the book and it said only 50 percent off.  REALLY.  I am so tired of companies not honoring their word.  The young lady had someone else come on the phone.  He claimed to be the manager 5/2/17.  He would not honor the free pizza.  Really... just lost a customer for good over a large pepperoni pizza that was in the book (I was obviously not lying).  Think about how much money Round Table could have made over the next few years.  Will go to Metro, Northside Nathan's  or North End Pizza from now on.  Too Bad!  Poor Management!"}
{"text":"Pizza was not as good as other round tables. Seemed like it was cooked too fast (crust was typically undercooked like many of the fast-food pizzas). I do want to say that the guys working were very friendly and nice. Also, salad bar was pretty good.

UPDATE 5/13/2011: I appreciate the comment from Roy F. This is a sign of good customer service, and I would return and try the restaurant again. The problem is that I live in California. I visited on a trip to Vegas with the family. So, my next review will have to wait until I return again. 

Thanks, though, Roy. And, best wishes!"}
{"text":"Only pizza place I will eat In Vegas !!
Always send me coupons 4$ off a large or a 15% off .
They always have my order ready by the time I pick it up which is good .
I also really like their lunch buffet! Clean place in a nice shopping center + a lot of parking ! 
Well worth a 20min. Drive !"}
{"text":"Pizza was good. BUT As far as eating here dont do it.. its beyond hot.. The manger keeps the A/C at 80 which is crazy becuz the poor employes working around ovens.. Its def ver very uncomfortable"}
{"text":"Health hazard!!
 This evening, I went to this place and there was a employe who was making the pizza.My husband find the employe didn't wear the rubber glove also she touch the dirty cloth from the bucket and wipe the pizza cutter with it.Later, My husband told her that she didn't wear the  rubber glove.At beginning, She was saying she did.But my husband told her she wasn't.
She said she is going to make another one.\"I will put the glove and make you\".We don't want her to cut the pizza(because we know the pizza cutter is dirty).
And we did take out.And we promised our self we will never come back again.NEVER EVER.
You have to watch out what you are eating and who how employe are making.We ate them at he home.The pizza is too oily and salty.
I never want to recommend even this place has HAPPY HOUR!!!
HEALTH HAZARD!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone is always so nice! I accidentally messed up with the online order and everyone was understanding and helpful, especially Star. She's amazing. Thank you for making this a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Came with the daughter for the lunch buffet on a Saturday, and probably will not be back. The place was packed, and there was absolutely no seating in the place. Despite the lack of seating, the people at the counter kept ringing people up. 

The kitchen could not keep up with the buffet, and the most pizza I ever saw on the buffet was about a half of a pizza. As soon as it was served, it was descended upon by all of the patrons waiting to grab it.

Food was ok, as far as pizza joints go, but I would rather pay more and not have to sprint for the first available bit of food. Might be a different experience on a weekday, or less crowded time."}
{"text":"Round table pizza is usually the bomb. In this case it is made by people who dont speak English and know nothing about making pizza.  Too much sauce, too much cheese, undercooked etc etc.    If I were the owner of this franchise I'd  get my act together cause this place blows."}
{"text":"This is our second time trying this place and all I can say is it took an hour and forty minutes for delivery after being quoted 1 hour which by itself in today's world is a stretch. No call to us saying they are running way behind or even an apology is sad. We just waited and waited and waited and waited some more wondering if we actually might get the food. Won't recommend or return."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome,  I go every week. ..pan pizza is the best, staff is good and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Round Table is the best! I know it is more expensive than other pizza places but the quality and taste is far superior to any pizza in town. I just left with two pizzas for pickup and it was awesome like usual. I can tell you that Edward at the front cashier was the most helpful person I have ever met at any restaurant. Great service. I wish there were one on my side of town in Southern Highlands but I will travel for pizza that good."}
{"text":"You always have to take pizza chains at face value and not expect to get authentic New York or Chicago pizza at these places but the doesn't mean that they are not good.  I always come here with my friends at lunch for their pizza buffet.  At 6.99 its more expensive then cici's but you get what you pay for ten times over.  The pizza is covered in high quality toppings and they make a variety of different pizzas all the time to satisfy all different taste buds.  They use a cheese mix on their pizzas that includes provolone and it just adds to the great taste of their pizza.  The garlic knots are great when they are fresh and hot, so if they are old ask for a new order to be placed out there and I've never had a problem with staff accommodating the request.    The salad bar is also included and is not bad for the price, it has all the fixings and dressings that you need to make a good salad but don't fill up!  Another plus is the ability to order pitchers of beer to wash down the meal with.  Enjoy the pizza and bring the family."}
{"text":"In general, we love Round Table. I decided to order online. Large King Arthur with NO Green Peppers and extra olives plus green onion.

Pizza has the green onion. It had NO olives and it had green pepper which does not digest well with me.

Totally inaccurate and my advice is to NOT order online or look at the pizza before you take it home.

Good pizza 5 Stars. Accuracy of the order, 1 star"}
{"text":"Great place to eat in for pizza. The Maui Zaui pizza was really good. Italian garlic supreme was delicious too. Service was fast and friendly.  Would come back again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Since Shakey's no longer exists in Vegas, this has become the next best thing. The crust is perfect ( I like it thin) the sauce is perfect, and the pie's always come out with those air bubbles in the crust .....love it!

Salad bar kicks ass too. Pizza and salad...the perfect combo if you ask me"}
{"text":"Its good food don't get me wrong just the price is a bit to out there,  for a large pizza 2 salad bar plates and 3 drinks came out to about $44 and an order of baffalo wings of 20 $22 its good food but too much to spend."}
{"text":"Although Grimaldis is my favorite pizza place, sometimes I want delivery and this is the best!  I've tried every pizza place in this area and believe me, Round Table is the best.  It's really good, fresh, hot, and tasty and they come fairly quick (even tho they tell you 45 minutes).  The only thing is you have to ask for the cheese and peppers or they won't include them."}
{"text":"This round table used to be my favorite place for pizza.  My last 2 visits were horrible.  
Last time we were there We ordered our pizza and salad bars and were waiting for our kids to join us. During the wait a customer saluted an employee and threw pizza all over the salad bar.  They closed the salad bar. The kids got there and we continued to wait for them to clean it up and open it.  After an hour they still hadn't. Nor had they made our pizzas. 1.5 hours after waiting still no salad bar or pizza. I went up and asked several times and I was told my pizza was just about to get made. At this point we got our money back and went to Applebee's. They used the situation to completely stop working. 

Today after a month or so we decided to try it one more time. I ordered my pizza to go. It's burnt, there are about 4slices of pineapple on my pepperoni and pineapple pizza. Never again."}
{"text":"This has been my go to pizza for years in Hawaii. I moved here and continued my cravings lol. This particular one on lake mead is very clean, very friendly staff,  and still the best pizza... to me. The other one on eastern? Nah. We used to go to that location because it's closer to us, but it's not as well kept as this one. Besides, the last couple visits we went to the eastern one, the pizza didn't taste the way it supposed to, that's why I come to this location now"}
{"text":"Basic pizza place as far as the food goes. The salad bar is limited but works for what it is. The pizza is average. The staff seemed overwhelmed. We did go after a soccer tournament at the fields next door.  If you are in the area and want a sit down spot, it will work"}
{"text":"Omg, this place smells like smoke, the bathrooms are horrible and we are the only ones here. Big 0 out of 10."}
{"text":"This is the absolute  worst place ever. Food is delicious as long as u eat in or pick up. Although  the veggies  in the salad bar are normally old and inedible.  Delivery  times are never  less then  1 hour 45 min but more like 2 hours even when quoted and hour.  They  are always quick to credit  your account but everytime i have allowed that  the next time i order my account doesnt  exist. I live about  12 min from  this location yet i wait 2 hours everytime. I order there is an issue.  I live in an apartment  complex of about 180 units. (Super small) with a map at the front  gate . The last time i ordered  and waited 2 hours  for my pizza which i was quoted 1 hour 15 min for.. when i called the store i was told that the driver couldnt find my apartment so he brought my food back 30 min prior. No phone call from the driver no phone call from the store. Just brought  it back and continued  on. They will also try to talk you out of delivery or tell u an outrageous  delivery time to try and make u not want a delivery. Its like they just show up to work for a paycheck and dont want to work.. What kind  of customer service is this? As far as im concerned this place should be shut down."}
{"text":"I love most Round Table Pizza. This place put very little veggies and too much cheese!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza. There is something unique about the spicy sauce that's awesome. The crispy crust is nice as well. The downside is it is more pricey vs other chain's significantly and sometimes you wait on hold a long time when placing your order. I would eat this once a week if it weren't for the price/affordability vs Pizza Hut or Dominos as my kids could care less about the quality difference."}
{"text":"I had to update my review simply because this my favorite pizza.  They have a unique flavor in their sauce and everything else seems fresher on it than other chain pizza places.  Of course, you're paying more for this and I had a problem with pricing for a long time as I have kids who could care less if it's Papa John's or Round Table (which is about twice as pricey) but....I discovered and finally settled in that it was at least twice more satisfying to me and worth the extra money.

 I also have not experienced any \"mediocre\" service for a long time and they are always pleasant at the location and always get my order correct.

If there was one knock, it's Tuesday buffet night where they sometimes have a hard time keeping up with the demand of consumers (pun intended)!  I will eat a wider variety than the kids, so I don't usually have to wait for them to make something new, but my kids are always waiting for them to put out a new pizza.

Overall, this is my favorite pizza place and they deserved the review update."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this location a few weeks ago. I tipped $3 on a $15 order. I looked at my credit card statement and see they charged a $6 tip on top of $2.50 delivery. I didn't dispute it with my bank because it's not even worth the time for $3, but I will never order from here again. Talk about shady."}
{"text":"We went for the Tuesday pizza buffet after reading about it on yelp. It wasn't open yet so we decided to go ahead and order off the menu. Pizza was excellent. Super fresh and didn't take much time. Customer service was really great as well. This was our first time here and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was wondering why this establishment is taking so long to credit my bank account for a voided transaction dating back to Sunday September 11..?
Unbelievable...."}
{"text":"I'm so annoyed right now because I'm pretty sure I got old ass fucking pizza with some overly salted wings. Definitely not worth $45."}
{"text":"This update is even better than my initial complaint. Congrats Round Table on Lake Mead, you ruined my birthday treat but gave me an awesome story. Pizza is a temporary indulgence but a funny story lasts a few weeks longer. 

So- going back to the date in question, April 6th, as  requested on the sides of the napkin dispensers in the restaurant that as a customer you may text or email the owner of any complaints, concerns or any feedback. I composed a text, frustrated but polite as I waited for my money back. My phone has it at 5:03 pm Friday April 6th, the receipt of the void return is also 5:03 pm Friday April 6th so it should be rather obvious I text at the time of the complaint. I heard back from the owner at 11:07 pm Sunday night, April 9th. No apology, only asking how the order was placed. 

Monday I had not been given a resolution, in the mean time I posted on yelp and called the corporate office. This owner had the freakin nerve to text me Tuesday with a completely inaccurate time line \"from the manager\" ( dealt with an assistant manager when I asked for my money back). Calling me a liar and still held the same rude tone. The saying is \"the customer is always right\", which usually is BS. In this case I told them to check any cameras to prove the time I was there along with a brief description of my clothing, where I was sitting and events that happened in the time I claim to have been there vrs the completely made up version of their management. Also took pictures of the receipt that discredited the story from the manager. Haven't heard back from the owner. They must either not believe their own receipt or fail to admit failure in the store/ in communication/ in honesty. 

They also asked for what I want from this. A better way with dealing with customers for a start, more ways than one. An apology would be nice. For the franchise, and people within to learn and grow from mistakes. Other than that... F that, we have many pizza options around here without the BS.

TLDR:
1. If someone orders a pizza for pick up, have it ready on time
2. Failing that make it ASAP as they wait'
3. Failing that don't lie to the owner of the franchise store to save your ass when the customer can easily prove otherwise with receipt/ video 
5. As an owner- don't be a jerk to a customer, answer concerns prompt and don't be so quick to dismiss them as a liar
6. Really?!- this is only pizza and should not be so much drama!"}
{"text":"I actually ordered for delivery online and I just have to say I am really impressed with their fast delivery time, my pizza was delivered within 30 min of ordering, this is my first time trying the pizza and I ordered the \"build your own\" pan cheese and pepperoni and boneless buffalo chicken wings, the pizza is delicious! Wings are good but probably not appropriate for delivery, they are too soggy for my liking but I will say I will order from here again for sure"}
{"text":"I reserve a 5 for one place as it relates to pizza. With that said we truly enjoyed today's overall experience. The service was fantastic, the ingredients were fresh for the pizzas and the salad bar. The price is a little high but worth it, I'd recommend this for anyone that wants to get away from the big delivery chains and enjoy a better pizza. 

Need to get that no beer thing fixed though....."}
{"text":"My wife and I love to go to Round Table for their lunch buffet.  It's cheap and the salad bar is big and the pizza is good. 

You can't beat the price, $6.99.  The salad bar has a lot of toppings.  The pizza is always good.  Love the thin crust and the great toppings.  Will always be back for the buffet."}
{"text":"Located in the corner of the Sprouts/ 99 Cents Only strip mall shopping center at Lake Mead and Buffalo. I could not tell from the pics I saw on the internet, not Yelp. 

Our first visit to this one's lunch buffet- mon- fri $7.49 for adults, while children over 4, @ $4.99 (pizza, twists, complete salad bar; drinks are extra) so we are familiar with it (we went to the one on Eastern a few times but they stopped having the lunch buffet on saturdays, sad face). Family night is tuesday night, same prices. (I've been wanting to come here for a while now, especially since we moved to this side of town.)

The counter is not far from the entrance, left middle. The fountain drink machine is along the wall after the counter. In the middle is the food (hot pizza and salad bar). To the right (on the other side of the food) is booth seating. The right back is the party room, semi-private seating. The middle back is the small arcade. The left back is where the bathrooms are located. The front of the restaurant, the same side of the entrance are table/ chair seating.

The customer service is very good. We got greeted right away by friendly voices and we paid after a few minutes of waiting. There were very few customers, maybe 5 or 6 parties. It seems like this buffet is a secret. Empty plates were taken away several times from the table. Hot fresh pizza and hot fresh twists were periodically added to the food station. The salad bar was neat. I also noticed that the tables were all very clean. The bathroom was pretty clean too. 

The pizza (smaller cuts) was yummy. I liked the cheese, king arthur's supreme, hawaiian, & veggie. Romaine lettuce, mushrooms, cucumbers, sliced green peppers, blue cheese dressing, sunflower seeds, and croutons. I also had a cinnamon twist. There's much more than I'm mentioning. Nostalgia: this was one of the popular pizza chains in SF, CA. 

I would say this is better than Cici's, better than a casino buffet although it is smaller, it's more quality, and I'm sure we'll be coming back again too."}
{"text":"Round Table Pizza buffet, mmm. Solid 4.5 stars.

This pizza chain took a while to come here, as this was one of the childhood pizza chains in the SF Bay Area which was very familiar to me (the other being Shakey's). Many, many years ago Pizza Hut had a buffet which was good, but they no longer have it. And for the past dozen years, out of all the pizzs chains, their pizza seems the greasiest. 

So, the only other place to compare it to is Cici's, which is the cheapest deal around. This one, of course, coupled with childhood nostalgia, is way better. The pizza (hawaiian, meat lovers, supreme, bbq chicken, pepperoni) was fresh and the salad (greens, spinach plus toppings) bar was plentiful with half a dozen dressings."}
{"text":"We had a great time at the buffet today. Lots of types of pizza. The staff is Always friendly, especially Carrie, who was out clearing tables the moment someone left so that we had a place to sit. We drive all the way across town just to come to this location because the staff is so nice."}
{"text":"I LOVE ROUNDTABLE PIZZA!!! The staff is always very nice & the pizza is awesome!! They actually have an arcade in the restaurant (I did not play any games)... that is pretty rare now a days. I also love the Garlic Twists. It brings me back to when I worked at Round Table Pizza 20+ years ago when they first came out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious gourmet pizza!! So glad Round Table is in our neighborhood!! The lunch buffet is awesome too-- all you can eat pizza and salad bar for just $6.99! Great deal! Love this place! Best pizza delivery ever!"}
{"text":"I ordered online for lunch today ordering online was very easy. I ordered an individual serving Roasted Veggies and Chicken Flatbread. When I got there to pick up my online order there were three people in line. When I got up to the register the tape ran out and they had no idea about my online order Luckily, the page was still open on my phone so I showed them my order number. The cashier suggested my flatbread was still in the oven?? I sat down and waited about 10 minutes more.

When I got my food, it was hot and very tasty. I was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of my flatbread. There were about eight 3-4 inch squared pieces of flatbread. it came in a 6x12inch box and the box was full. I recall thinking this is comparable to quality at a nice italian restaurant and I only costs me $6.49!! I was concerned that I would be late in returning to work and thats why I pre-ordered and also why I took a star off. I will be ordering these flatbread items more often when i'm in the area to try different orders."}
{"text":"I did not dine in but I did get delivery service. Delivery guy was earlier than what was stated which is okay with me as I was HUNGRY!!  Great pizza White Sauce is the best.  Salad I ordered was fresh just don't put croutons in it they were soggy. Still y'all get  5."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of chain pizza joints, but this one had me pleasantly surprised!  We reserved the back room for my daughter's soccer team's lunch between tournament games and it was neat, clean and ready to go when we got there.  We ordered the Gourmet Pepperoni and it was delicious.  The girls enjoyed the cheese pizza and wings, while most of the other moms had the salad bar.  Lots of choices for all of us!"}
{"text":"Well, there are only so many places to eat in Terminal 2, the oldest and smallest terminal at SKy Harbor Airport. 

There are more since they remodelled it a few years ago at least.

When the young freckled red head that is \"always fresh\" and \"always juicy\" seems to be a little tired an old to you, you can opt for the Knights of the Round Table to fill your hunger. ROund Table pizza, that is.

1 combo #3         $5.75
1 slice cheese    $3.35
Total                      $9.95

I don't remember what the combo thing was. Soda and what?"}
{"text":"Best pizza hands down! Wish Las Vegas had more locations. The King Arthur supreme pizza and the vegetarian pizza are my two favorites."}
{"text":"The last two times I ordered their pizza it was undercooked! If cooked correctly, the chicken garlic gourmet is one of the best around. I noticed the person that was handling the oven prematurely pulling out the pies...this is a no no!
The Henderson location does a much better job."}
{"text":"Had the Garlic Chicken pizza tonight. Surprisingly average. Have had it here many times in the past and it was really, really good. Tonight, no so much. Cost went up, toppings and flavor went down. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the gourmet veggie pizza!! But if you're not a patient person maybe eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"We ordered buffets for our family of four, then paid.  We asked for a meat pizza with extra sauce and no bacon.  The lady mentioned that they could not make the pizza with extra sauce as their customers might eat it, like it, and then expect it in the future.  We also asked about a cheese pizza for the kids, and aside from the look of inconvenience, it seemed to be okay. She then asked the manager if they could do the extra sauce on the pizza, and it was a definite \"no\". We asked for our money to be refunded, and now we're headed elsewhere.  Sad turnout as we had an awesome experience in July at another Vegas Roundtable pizza that made us want to return.  This has sealed the deal that we will NEVER return to this business. Thanks for making our decision easy!  Happy New Year!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review in the frustration I am having with round table. First, I tried to order online. They could not find a location near me, no matter what zip code, address, navigation menu I tried and I know that there is one up the street. I give up on trying to order online and just want to look at the menu to try to budget my order. The site doesnt show prices. 

I give up the Internet and try the old fashioned phone call order. I called this particular round table. The first two times the line was busy. The third time, I get a ring, and a ring, and a ring, and a ring. No one answers the phone. I hang up and try again. I get a ring, and a ring, and a ring, and a ring. After about the tenth ring I give up.

I don't have a review on the food because apparently round table doesn't want me to order from them. I wish I could tell you they have great customer service, but they apparently don't want to talk to me either, on the phone anyways. I can tell you their website is not very helpful. 

I'm frustrated. Guess I'll just stick to five dollar hot and ready's instead of trying the $20+ pizzas. Can't say I didn't try though!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet with drink for $10 bucks and change. The selection was okay with 4-5 different pizzas and dessert twists. The salad bar was bare minimum but okay for a simple lunch menu. Staff was okay and prompt.

Quick lunch joint with no frills to get your pizza fix!"}
{"text":"Stopped by and got a large pepperoni pizza at Round Table Pizza. Also added extra sauce and cheese. I was very impressed and it definitely fixed my pizza craving. Recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"I love Round Table pizza and went here today for their buffet. Their buffet ends at 2pm and I got there's few minutes past 2. There was only 1 other customer eating and the buffet table was still loaded with food. I asked for 1 for the buffet and was told no, lunch is over. 
Instead of taking another customer, they would rather waste all that food and loose a paying customer. I took my wallet elsewhere and won't go back to Round Table after that."}
{"text":"I called in from work , to get a pizza for my girlfriend who was home and got no problems. Star who answered the phone and she was awesome and helped me out with different deals and even gave me a discount cause they ran out of two litters of soda n comp me a 20oz soda. Pizza was not bad at all and got great delivery real fast. Would recommend, and I will be going in and trying it out cause the great service I got from Star so friendly."}
{"text":"This review actually has nothing to do with the pizza and everything to do with with what I consider poor policies and management. The pizza is typical Round Table. If you like Round Table, this franchise does a good job with the pizza.

For delivery if you use a credit card, these guys require identification (which is great) and a physical copy of your credit card. Yes, a physical copy of your card is carried around with an unbonded, probably non-background-checked delivery driver in a probably unlocked car for who knows how long. This practice may have resulted in $325 stolen from my bank account (identity theft). (((I am adding this last part at the request of the owner of this Round Table franchise, who responded privately to my Yelp review but would not otherwise respond to my attempts to contact him (or her - I don't have a name). I attempted to contact the owner TWICE before I posted this review, by the way. I cannot prove that the fraudulent transaction on my card was due to Round Table, its policies, or its employees. What I can prove is that the timing was awfully coincidental and that no other company has ever taken a copy of my card. That card was also not out of my control for any extended period of time prior to the Round Table incident. Everything in this review is completely factual and accurately reflects my experience with this company. It also reflects my personal opinion of the company and its policies.)))  

The manager is, I'm afraid, completely clueless and trapped in her \"it's the company policy\" mindset. The owner never responded to my messages at the \"text the owner\" number.

When a company has this kind of irresponsible behavior and reckless disregard for the financial safety of its customers, they can keep their pizza. I don't support this kind of business.

As I said, the quality is typical Round Table. If you don't care about customer service and what the company does with your personal information, give them a shot."}
{"text":"I feel so offended. I have ordered from round table pizza before with no problem. This time i ordered online and got a phone call from someone accusing me of fraud , telling me she can't deliver to me. Luckily the manager for on the phone and was a sweetheart. That is the only reason they even get 1 star. I had to wait for her to call the general manager and get approval. Apparently under my name in the account was notes saying it was fraud. Idk who would have gone to that extent to do this but I am very taken back by the poor customer service."}
{"text":"I love this place. We take classes right next door and this is always a great dinner option."}
{"text":"Being from California more specifically Bay Area. I love that they brought this joint out in Vegas. This spot has been nostalgia for me because I ate here often growing up with my family. Many of the customers complain about a lot of irrelevant mishap they have but don't expect so much for a pizza spot. Just keep it simple and enjoy the taste of the pizza. I love the fact that I just remembered that I haven't brought my husband here yet. We've been to a couple of pizza joints but I forgot to mention this to him."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer and have been purchasing pizza for two years now. 

The new cashier Rose was extremely rude when I asked her to keep the cheese and only give me extra peppers and plates, without even looking in the bag she said \"oh I already put extra in the bag for you. 
I purchased 2 XL pizzas and she gave me 3 freakin plates and 4 crushed peppers and did not even take the cheese packets out. 

Very upset with the customer service from her. 

The manager STAR is always amazing and takes care of the customers. 

If anybody goes there make sure you double check the bags and do not give rose benefit of the doubt!"}
{"text":"We ordered from Yelp... Which made it a third party order... The order came to last 2 1/2 hours later which I'm not complaining about... We were well aware of the time to have it delivered. When we got her food everything on the entire order was incorrect and when I called the general manager she said there was nothing they can do other than send out the proper order but it would take an additional 2 1/2 hours.  I requested a refund for my entire meal considering it was entirely wrong and she told me she did not know how to do that considering it was from a third-party order. So needless to say the staff was incredibly rude they did not know how to refund her money and we did not get the food that we wanted... We have been ordering from them for many years and will never ever order again he basically gave him $65 for absolutely nothing!"}
{"text":"Haven't had round table in a long time. We heard they were back open and decided to give it a try. We ordered two pizza specials. Each pizza was 11.99 for a large one topping. One pepperoni and one black olive. The pizza was just as I remembered. Each pizza had plenty of cheese , sauce and toppings. Not bad for a chain. I called in our order and they told me it would be ready in 20 minutes. We got there right about at the 20 minute mark but still had a considerable wait for it to be ready. They did give us two fountain drinks for free to apologize for the wait. We did appreciate that. We will order from them again."}
{"text":"Round Table is alright, I guess.

I visited Round Table for the first time on a California road trip in 2002.  I remember it being the PERFECT PIZZA.  I guess my mind was playing tricks on me.  It's far from perfect.  Actually, sometimes the pizza can be downright icky.

This was one of the first places I visited when I moved to Vegas because I was soooo excited to be near a Round Table.  Sadly, it never did live up to my heightened expectations.  I have been to Round Table half a dozen times and ordered basically the same thing (Guinevere's Garden)... and each time, the pizza is vastly different.  Sometimes it is cooked perfectly, while other times the crust is almost raw in the middle.  Sometimes the pizza is overwhelmingly greasy, while other times it is light and delicious.  I don't ever really know what to expect.  I really dislike inconsistency, so I will only visit Round Table in a pinch these days.  It's not the most satisfying meal ever, but it gets the job done.

2 1/2 stars, but since we can't do halves, I guess I'll go with 3 because the workers are always pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Okay.... I wanted something homey and hearty to eat last night all in my lonesome. I decided for something I haven't had in a long time, but also something worth my money. 

Decision? Maui zaui pizza at round table for one please! This flavorful, mouthwatering, scrumptious, sliced-up, oven baked creation is still to this day one of my favorite top three and go eat when I need cheering up food. Maui zaui alone deserves four stars. Makes me wanna dance sitting on my couch with every bite I bite. Haha. Mix it with chicken wings, coke and a funny show or movie and you have just been cheered up. Sooo cheered up that I woke up this morning inspired to write my first review. 

Only reason I didn't give round table the so easily given fifth star is because they need to jump on the van wagon and make some deals for customers the same way pizza hut has ten dollar large pizzas. Maybe then they wouldn't have so many round table's in town closed and receive 'woohoo! As good as it gets!' ratings. Thanks for reading! =]"}
{"text":"I can't believe I never wrote a review of this location! The lady manager is really nice and the food is always fresh and hot. I've been here so many times I've lost count. I grew up on round tables in California since I was a little girl and now I bring my daughter to round tables. Best pizza ever!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went in to eat the Tuesday night buffet. After paying for the food we went into the larger room to sit and eat. After a few minutes one of the employees comes in to the room, puts a DVD into a player and turns on a children's movie. My wife and I are the only two people in that room. When I ask this employee if, perhaps, we could change the channel to something else, maybe the news. I was told, in no uncertain terms \"NO!!\". \"It's family night and we are REQUIRED to play a children's movie. When I point out that there are NO children in the entire restaurant and, perhaps, we can change the channel and if a child does come in we can, at that point, turn the movie on. That was greeted by rolling of the eyes and another \"NO!!\". Guess the customer is not right at this Round Table Pizza. Oh, BTW, the pizza was not fresh or close to being tasty. The same pizzas that were there when my wife and i came in were still there an hour later. Nothing fresh ever came out of the oven. Looks like I'm going to cross this restaurant off of my dining list."}
{"text":"I love Round Table Pizza!!!I have been going here since I was a kid!! I always get great service and awesome food. I love their garlic parmesean twists. And I live going on Wednesday nights for their all you can eat family night. All you can eat pizza twist and salad for only $6.99. And they always show a movie which is awesome for my kids."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally go to a RTP after not being near one for years. I was disappointed. 
There were five employees in the building. Two heavier set guys were working and were very nice and helpful. A delivery driver was there, also working and very nice. There was a guy in a grubby RTP tee, eating and there was a young woman there who couldn't be bothered enough to look up from her phone. 
The store wasn't dirty, but there are a LOT of repairs that need to be done. The dining area, lobby, restrooms and (empty) arcade all had a lot of damage. 
I ordered a pepperoni pizza and Parmesan twists. The pizza was just good, and how I remembered it tasting, but the twists... I don't know if the recipe has changed in the years since I last ate at RTP, or if the staff made them incorrectly, but they were my favorite thing on the menu and I was very disappointed. I remember twists with ooey, gooey, creamy garlic sauce twisted into breadsticks covered in Parmesan cheese. What I got, was a lot of bread. Dry bread with barely enough garlic and parm to differentiate them as twists and not crusts. 
The three nice gentlemen earned the three stars. I won't go back for the ambiance or the food."}
{"text":"Love this Round Table. Great service and food. Anthony at the front counter is very friendly and great in offering promotions such as on Mondays get 1 pizza, get 1 free. So 2 XL for the price of one!"}
{"text":"I called in for delivery last night because I had no desire to cook. I ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and grilled chicken, some wings, and a flat bread. I was surprised when my door bell rang just 30 mins later. The pizza was good, very generous on the toppings. The flat bread was also good. The fresh mozzarella balls on top were to die for. But I have to admit the wings were the highlight of my meal. I ordered BBQ wings and they were crispy and saucy and everything a chicken wing should be. Ask for specials when you call, if not it can be a little pricey. I found coupons on the website. Definitely worth the extra money though. The quality is much better then any chain pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch buffet. For only $6.99 you can stuff yourself silly with pizza breadsticks salad and dessert.  Drinks are not included but I only drink water so that was no big deal. My favorite pizza was a BBQ chicken. The selection was good, everytime I went up to get more food there was about 7 pizzas to chose from.  Definitely will return ASAP."}
{"text":"Ordered and paid by credit card over the internet for convenience and security. When pizza arrived the driver demanded my credit card to make an imprint copy. No I'm not handing over my credit card to a pizza kid after I've already paid. Keep your pizza. Drove to the restaurant the next day for a cash refund."}
{"text":"We ordered a med pan maui zaui pizza, 3 garlic bread sticks, 12 buffalo wings, and a drink for 15 with the 15 for 30 groupon

- Great deal w friendly service! although the total came out higher than the retail price, he was nice enough to ring us up without having to pay extra! :)
- Everything served fresh. Pretty standard at every RT i go to. 
- maui zaui is my favorite pizza. i love rt. everyone knows their taste and quality. 
- pretty far from spring valley. -___-. 
- probably the best rt i've been to. keep it up guys."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that RTP is back in business.   Maui Zaui withdrawals no more!  It's not gourmet pizza or New York pizza by any means but for some reason I like to have my RTP fix every once in a while.  There's something special about the Polynesian sauce they use for the Maui Zaui.  It's sweet but tangy and mildly spicy that works well with the ham, pineapple and red onions.

I ordered 7 pizzas (Maui Zaui, Guinevere's Garden Delight, King Arthur's Supreme, Ulti-Meat, and Chicken & Garlic), salads and some Cinnamon Twists a day in advance.  I got a message the next day saying that they couldn't get my pizzas ready by 11:00-11:30am because of \"how big the order was\" - this was second-hand information so I don't know the exact statement made by RTP.  So, I called to figure out what's going on.  Pleasant staff and I got my pizzas and everything else a bit after 11:30, no problemo!

Out of all the inexpensive chain pizza places, Round Table is definitely awesome!"}
{"text":"Round Table is hands down my fave pizza in town.  I've tried various pies from different places, from chains to independent family joints, and always come back to Round Table. Why?  Because it's just great pizza.  It is a bit pricier than some, although not by much. You get quality pizza.  I love the garlic supreme pizza.  This location is in a shopping plaza in a fairly okay part of town somewhat near Summerlin, it's  always clean and the customer service is  friendly.  If you've never tried Round Table, you really should, you'll be surprised at what a quality pizza this is - the cheese, the crust, the sauce, it's all good.  I even take out of town relatives here who don't have Round Table in their areas and they RAVE about how good this pizza is and always say they wish they had a Round Table.  I'd rather go here than to some no name place where it's a crapshoot as to what the quality will be or some over-hyped \"trendy\" pizza place that overcharges but under-delivers!  I know I'll get my money's worth  and won't be dumping a pizza in the trash or be embarrassed that I brought a friend or relative to eat here.  There's not a huge amount of dining area, but it's been fine any time I've been there."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch buffet while staying in Vegas and it was good food, good service, and great price! 6.99$ for lunch buffet and 1.99$ for a drink. Paid about 10$ with tax and it was well worth it. 
Good amount of different types of pizzas, good salads with good amount of toppings and yummy bread and cinnamon twists! 
Great workers, they made sure we were happy with the pizza."}
{"text":"Never been to the sky harbor location . The ones in CA are real good tho!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has absolutely the Best Pizza in town!
Without thinking much about it, we started going there more and more. And then it dawned on us! We were laughing and saying we're not even supposed to be eating this much pizza, we have to slow down!
The pizza has the right amount of sauce, and topping, and it's always hot when it come to the table.
Thank you to the manager and staff!
You're doing an awesome job!"}
{"text":"This round table is always amazing 5 stars for the food and the employees. The only problem they don't serve beer!!!!!! They have the tap system visible from a different owner. How do you not have beer at a pizza place? 

I will change my review to a full 5 star when I can sit down and have a couple beers with my pizza."}
{"text":"If you have been to a Round Table before, then you can expect the same great pizza. The staff is super friendly. The only negative thing about this location is the inside. This place definitely needs a makeover BAD! If you can get past the run down feel of the furniture then you will enjoy your meal. 

I hope they redo the inside soon, they will definitely get more business."}
{"text":"I'm a Round Table Pizza fan.I love their pizza. Hopefully they keep up the quality and don't start cutting corners...like most pizza joint does... Hopefully they'll stand by their motto \" the last honest pizza\".  They just need to upgrade their dining area and their game room. Also they need to serve beer and wine. Other than that 5 star all the way."}
{"text":"How did we end up eating at a 3.5 star pizza place? We have an Entertainment book, opened it to a random page and a Round Table Pizza coupon was there. Being not too far from the house, we made the trip.

We had to wait for almost 10 minutes for the guy working the register, and two of the kitchen staff to finish flirting with the girls in front of us that came in to pick up an order that was called in. The staff could not deduce which order was theirs, out of what looked like a very limited number of options. An offhand comment was made that they should sell the girls \"a big bag of 'oregano'\" - this will become more relevant in a moment.

FINALLY, they finished the debacle that was handing off three pizzas and collecting funds for said food.

We ordered, had to repeat ourselves multiple times as to what we wanted, the guy behind the counter had the toughest time listening/comprehending/pressing buttons.

When our food finally came out, we were wondering about the logic behind their pizza. The wife ordered a specialty pizza that had all sorts of vegetables and some meats in melted cheese. For whatever reason, some of the vegetables were just thrown on *after* the pizza was cooked.

My BBQ chicken pizza was ok, messy as all could be, but tasted alright. 

When it came time to rinse my hands of BBQ sauce, I made my way back to the restrooms. Remember when I said the staff's comment earlier would be relevant? There was this very distinct, strong and pungent smoky smell coming from the kitchen area. Wonder what that could be. Not really, I know what it was, I've been to high school and college.

Once that hit our nostrils, it became clear why the staff could not concentrate or use basic logic to figure out which order to give the customers.

Here we are three days later and my wife is still trying to get to where she feels better. Amazing how eating at a place can have an immediate and long lasting effect on a person. 

Needless to say, we won't be going back to Round Table Pizza, this one or any others. For that much money per pizza, there are many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, better options."}
{"text":"Food: Large half combination/half-pepperoni. Being from the Bay Area, I was craving an old favorite. It was great to have that RTP flavor again - no other pizza tastes like this! It seemed slightly different than I was used to - I think it needed to be more saucey or something, but still good.

Ambiance: other reviews seemed to complain about it being dirty and tables not cleared, but we didn't experience that. Besides how clean do you expect chain pizza places to be?

Service: Ordered at the counter with no problem. I brought in a coupon that I had printed from their website online and they accepted it.

Location: off Eastern in a plaza with plenty of parking!

Since I saw all the bad reviews related to problems with delivery, we opted to come in and eat it there."}
{"text":"This was absolutely horrible. I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats.  I threw it in the trash. I will wait until I get to my destination to eat. Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is fantastic. Thin, crispy and the best I've had since I moved from Chicago to Henderson. But, they really need to clean up their act. If they would just clean up the place and make it look a bit better they could make a fortune."}
{"text":"An all-around great pizza place with awesome food at good prices. What's better than that, though, is their service which always seems willing to help you. I eat there at least once a week and have told my friends to try it as well."}
{"text":"As far as international pizza chains goes, Round Table is the best IMHO.

I lived in California for a big chunk of my life, and have tried pizzas made by all of their major competitors (you know who they are), and RT has always been the pizza of choice for its superior quality and taste.  So I was glad to find a few RT franchises in Las Vegas.

This particular location is near the new Bachi Burger location on West Sahara and a local theater, and the staff here are usually pretty friendly. I been here about 4-5 times and it is never really busy, so the wait for your pizza is usually not much longer than it takes for them to assemble and bake.

Guinevere's Garden Delight and Maui Zaui are my usual orders, when I get a RT craving.  

Food:  4/5  Yummy.

Price/Value:  3.5/5  More expensive than their competitors, but it also tastes better than their national chain competitions.

Parking: 4/5 Plenty of spaces.

Service:  4/5  Quick.

4 stars."}
{"text":"My all time favorite has been round table. But the lake mead location customer service sucks!
No smile on anyone's face. They simply don't care. There lunch should end at 2.30pm and not 2 pm. If you are one minute late it's not honored. Who does that to a regular customer. They don't even apologize. The management sucks!!!!
Bad customer service.... has happened to me few times. My family has already stopped going there. Now I will tell my friends too."}
{"text":"First off I was shocked how good there pizza is. Yes it is a zestier pizza sauce, non traditional form of pizza sauce. I was thinking it would of been more like chucky cheese pizza. However I really did like the this style crust alot better then dominos pizza and flavor wise taste better/ fresher. 


However my gripe is the chicken bits and the Polynesian wing sauce, little to no sauce and at times felt like you where eating gristle etc. Recommendation  try chicken wings. 

Pizza was there meat special, and was quite nice. 

They do deliver to 89108 area code if you where looking at places."}
{"text":"With my Groupon in hand and a hankering for some pizza pie, we headed to Round Table Pizza. Round Table is a standard pizza chain. We ordered a specialty meat lover's and a couple of sodas. The pizza is pretty tasty. Nothing amazing, but definitely solid pizza. 

The restaurant can be fun for kids. There are video games are fun (albeit dated) and my kid at heart fella spent some time playing them while we waited for the pizza to arrive. Service was friendly and efficient. I have no qualms coming back in the future."}
{"text":"I tried calling Rosati's at 9:20PM on a Sunday, and I was told that they were closing in 10 minutes, and that the ovens were off.  I informed them that according to Yelp and their own site, it states 10PM, not 9:30PM.  The girl on the phone apologized.

No problem.  I call this Round Table, and they are more than happy to take my order.  I ordered the All Meat Marvel, and it was great!!!  Thanks for bailing me out.  Now, you will be my FIRST call!"}
