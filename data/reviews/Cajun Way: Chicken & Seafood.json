{"text":"Really terrible food, took them forever to make it and the chicken was all breading 

I had the tomato bisque soup which was watery and flavourless.

The crispy chicken wrap only consisted of lettuce, way too much mayonnaise and a small piece of meat"}
{"text":"I am writing this as I wait for my order to be taken, oh yes thats how long I have to wait, and no its not because of a rush of hungry chicken lovers. They have no organized way of preparing, serving and taking orders. I am actually quiet frustrated at this point."}
{"text":"For those looking for a Quick Halal Meal and happen to be in the area of Heartland Mississauga, consider coming to this restaurant! Absolutely delicious and everything is hand slaughtered. I highly recommend this place if you're in search for something similar to Popeyes. A lot more tasteful than Max's seafood and chicken. Along with good food they have Great service with minimum waiting time. The owners are very friendly as well. Try it out! You won't be disappointed. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I used to go there when they had just opened, like brand spanking new, the customer service was awesome, I had good conversation with owner and his 2 sons, they are hard working and passionate about their restaurant.

Now the food, I used love their fries, ( it is possible that they are Costco fries) a lot of restaurants use them, but they are damn good, just with regular salt not any Cajun spice.

The Chicken in the beginning was simple and flavorful, I really liked it, but did not really have the Cajun kick to it, and I think a lot of folks complained or something so they added some spices to their batter. that made their chicken look darker in color and the Cajun spice seemed a little overwhelming for me, that being said the owner always suggested that he would custom the batter if you call ahead, more spice, less spice or mega spicy whatever you like..now there are not lot of fried chicken places that would offer do such a thing.

So I give them props for that, I eat super healthy now or at least I try. I cant do deep fried food anymore so I don't go as much 

that's my two cents :)"}
{"text":"Have to wait for 15 minutes true 
Hot and fresh food love that 
Nice people behind the counter 
but no free WiFi for customers that's why 4.5"}
{"text":"Meh, Chicken was pretty bland, fries were the typical supermarket fries. Whole place and experience was typical of any cheap low quality, no name fried chicken joint."}
{"text":"For some reason, people in Mississauga love fried chicken and there is always a lineup between 5:30 to 8:00.  Walking into this place at 6 pm and with no one there (besides possibly the owner or an employee's friend who was eating there), I should have realized it was a bad sign.  The place wasn't too dirty of anything, but the food wasn't that good at all.

Ordered the 2 pc chicken meal - chicken was so brown it looked like their frying oil hasn't been drained in a long time.  Very bland tasting and wasn't spicy at all.  

Fries - while decently spicy and somewhat fresh, they tasted like they were out a store bought bag or something.  

Service: Felt awkward because as I was leaving, it seemed like the employee (or owner) started just chatting in another language even though I was still there eating. Very awkward experience.

Verdict: don't bother."}
{"text":"Best chicken sandwich in the GTA hands down.
me and my friend and other friends and their other friends have been coming 
since the first visit.

Very friendly service, everything is cooked fresh
 their burgers are better than popeyes and they even have a beef burger variation which is as thick as lick's but better tasting!
and if your looking for a healthy alternative they even offer a grilled chicken sandwich too

i recommend this place to all my friends as Mississauga's hidden gem. With popeyes out of the market, cajun way successfully takes the crown."}
{"text":"Well guys this place is closed down due to lack of customers. What does that tell you?  I'll tell you.

A) expensive food
B) okay tasting food
C) Popeye's just next intersection

I went there a couple of times and the service was extremely poor, slow, and food did not taste that great either.

I don't know why these people start opening up \"Halal\" places in the hopes of hitting a jackpot, not delivering quality food and on top of that keeping their prices just as high as well established businesses like Popeye's.

If they want to make same profit then they better make same good tasting food also.

Sorry to see another place closing down. I hope the owner is reading my review because I don't want him to go open another restaurant and be ashamed of his failed endeavor yet again."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has got such bad or mediocre review. I came here months ago and I tried their fish sandwich and it was one of the best sandwich I have ever had. Here I am back again. It's empty. I feel sad for this place not having more customers to enjoy their food."}
{"text":"To put it simply, this is great hangover food. All the food is extremely fresh, however the chicken can sometimes be too greasy and overbearing, but that is perfectly when you're hungover. On a regular basis the fried chicken may be a tad bit too greasy.

Their sandwiches though are amazing, super fresh and super tasty. I've only tried the fried fish and chicken, and grilled chicken sandwich and all three were excellent. I often drop by just for the sandwiches and than head to the bubble tea store next door!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review literally as I'm eating the food we just wasted our money on ($30+). We bought the 12 piece combo that came with the gravy, mash potato & Mac and cheese sides. The mash was honestly some of the worst I've ever eaten - watery, bland and completely tasteless! In fact, I'm certain it's powder mix bought from Bulk Barn. The Mac & cheese was also watery and tasteless, how did they mess this up? Even no-name brand kraft dinner would've tasted better. The fries were fine but bought from Costco, which they overcharged on since they weren't real Cajun fries.
The chicken itself was not at all spicy or \"Cajun\" flavoured. Like the other sides, it was very bland. The only reason this place gets 1 star is because the chicken was crispy and we didn't end up getting food poisoning. However if you're looking for chicken that is comparable to Popeyes or the like, this is not the place! If you were thinking of trying out this new place like we were, save your money and try someplace else, unless you have a thing for making bad life choices."}
{"text":"LOVE their food, trird their chicken sandwich, wings and fries. Yes you have to wait 15 min for the wings but thats because they make it fresh unlike poppays and kfc that warms up the chicken and gives it to us within a min. Chicken is fresh and big! Worth every penny, must try once! Will return :)"}
{"text":"Basic fried chicken at premium price.  No spice. No flavor in the batter. Especially if you compare to the pervious tenant, Popeyes."}
{"text":"With the amount of Halal Fried Chicken restaurants opening up, Cajun Way is another entry. But make no mistake, the chicken is well seasoned & has a unique taste. I've tried their crispy chicken sandwich, it was quite good as well. I cannot comment on the other items on the menu, but their chicken is delicious. 

But a word of caution, it's better to call ahead of time to reduce wait times."}
