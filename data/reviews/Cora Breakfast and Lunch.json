{"text":"Bad service, long wait for the foods as well as for their service, took more than 20 minutes just to bring the utensils..."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's cozy, welcoming, clean and a perfect place for breakfast and brunch! The staff is nice and knowledgeable.

The selection of meals is varied and rich! The portions are very generous (and definitely worth the price).

Be aware weekend lineups start at 10am, so unless you are okay with waiting, I suggest you come early!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Cora recently and seem like they change the management.  The food came out faster and the service are so much better than before.  I ordered from the lunch menu which come with soup. The soup was delicious and the vegetable skillet was hot and good.  The only thing is they don't do substitution for vegetable but that's ok. Overall, this location got much better.  I will go there again next time with my friends."}
{"text":"food never came after placing order for 45 mins.  the waitress said it is a computer issue, but it doesn't really matter why.  her job is to check with the kitchen if she notices the food haven't arrived for that long."}
{"text":"Yet a another Cora's should be expected disappointing experience. 
We walk in the door at 9 am this morning and the sole waitress is occupied with a table. No problem, I get it but then she looks over, sees us and doesn't acknowledge us. The cook (a very pleasant lady with a massive smile comes out of the kitchen and sets us. The server then comes over and moves us to another table and leaves us one too few menus (there are only 2 of us), which the cook who originally sat us got right. 
We order out food, and coffee and then we wait, and wait, and wait some more. 
We don't get our coffee until after we got our breakfast (or the first parts of it at least) eventually after about 5 minutes the toast arrives. We did not say anything to our waitress as she was in a bad enough mood and the golden rule in the food and beverage industry is 'don't mess with the people who handle your food'. But she eventually remembered. 

Food was good, as to be expected at a Cora's but the service was terrible. I will not come back. And you shouldn't try it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here yesterday for a tasty breakfast.  Was lucky and arrived just before the rush and line-ups.  I'd say any time you arrive before 11am, the easier it is to get a seat.

Food came quickly. I had Orange Juice & the Poached Egg with fruit and cottage cheese. The bf had Coffee with the gargantuan feast (3 sausages, 3 bacon and 3 eggs).  We were pretty happy.  

If you just need a quick breakfast a step above mcDonalds - well Cora's is the place to be. 

Service was a slow on this day.  We were a table for 2 and waited a while for our server to arrive.  To be fair, I think they were under staffed on this day.  When I showed our server the Yelp Deal for a free cocktail - he pointed at the checkout and said - they will deal with this when you check out.

What we didn't realize is that we never ordered a free cocktail.  I wish our server had pointed that out instead of just telling us that the checkout would deal with the coupon.   I was miffed that after taking our order and seeing the coupon, he didn't point this fact out.  This place lost points for his actions. 

So upon getting our tab from another server (our server disappeared), we showed the Yelp deal for a free cocktail.   The lady realized that we didn't actually order a \"juice cocktail\" and quickly solved the situation.

Instead of saying too bad, you lose out - she gave us a coupon for a free juice cocktail so that we wouldn't miss out the next time we were back.  That's really great service there. She turned a potentially disappointing situation into a memorable experience.

It might seem like a trivial scene to describe. But I think it's worth mentioning because what she did changed my souring disposition towards this establishment. 

I wish I remembered her name, because I will be coming back here when I'm in the mood for some fast breakfast."}
{"text":"So this morning when I woke up, first thing in my mind is egg Benedict. I googled the nearest cora's . I have been to many Other locations, such as Richmondhill, Scarborough,etc. I also lived in BC for 5 years so I tried many different Coras in BC as well. This Cora? Is must be a joke. Serves was bad, the guy was literally talking to his coworker while I was waiting for the water. Didn't bother to check on me while I'm eating!! And the food sucks.. Everything was over cooked. The Hollandaise sauce was too salty and they put too much lemon juice in it. So it tastes both salty and sour. I can not believe they ruined the spirite of the egg Benedict."}
{"text":"Cora supposed to offer a fabulous breakfast and lunch. Instead of receiving the fabulous breakfast, I was served with salty, unflavoured ham and egg Benedict, extremely sour fruits and unappetizing potatoes. The only good thing about the place was extremely efficient Asian server. Even the hostess was not friendly when we walked in. Overall experience... I left the place with abnormally bloated stomach. Think twice before coming to this place."}
{"text":"Been here more than a handful of times, and usually service 70% good of the time. For some reason it always seem like they are understaffed even though the place is 50% empty... 

Service: 3/5 (read above)

Food: Food quality is pretty consistent throughout the times I've been there, but nothing out of the ordinary 3.5/5

Price: Cora is known to be a little bit more priced than your average place, but still affordable. 3/5

Overall it's a place for me to grab a quick meal as I work relatively close, but for the price and the service - I wouldn't trek out of my way for Cora's."}
{"text":"I have not had a chance to jump on the craze for Cora's until recently.

Dead honest truth: It's just hype! & not for the hardy breakfast lovers

if you're looking for a simple breakfast with a serving of fruit and you don't have to travel down to the city. This place will do. 

Like alot of places that go commercial, quality will drop and it becomes \"cookie cutter\"

On the plus side, good service, free refills and new papers.

If anyone is looking for a classic breakfast diner and doesn't mind travelling to Pickering. Kathryn's is a great place!"}
{"text":"It's a Cora's. Things that are normal:

* there will be a line, it will be less bad than you're worried about
* portions are diet-smashingly huge
* there is a lot of fruit

It's a good addition to a relatively dire set of brunch options in the area, and I'm a sucker for brunch."}
{"text":"I used to love Cora's, and was worth waiting and lining up for. The service used to be pleasant, and the staff was very attentive.

Fast forward to now, the food is still good, but the service was just horrible.

The hostess was busy cleaning tables herself when we arrived, so it took a while to be seated. Once we sat down, the waiter (Kenneth, I think) was incredibly friendly, to the point where I noticed and asked him what made him so cheerful! He said he just loves the job -- very promising!

We ordered our food, and we sat and sat and sat for about 40 mins. Upon looking at the kitchen, there was food lined up under the heat lamps but no one was being served. I called Kenneth asking why it wasn't being served. His response was that there was a chef there that demanded perfection, and that unless the food was perfect, no customer should be served. Looking around the restaurant, no customer was being served!

I complained and asked for the owner, she got my food to the table 5 minutes later, while everyone else still waited.

The downside to this whole experience was that no one was being served, customers were irritated, the cash register was empty (as the girl/owner was busy serving and cleaning tables), which meant that no one could pay/get the bill, which meant no one was leaving, which meant that new customers were not able to get seated. 

It's as if everything was at a standstill.

Worst of all, our waiter Kenneth disappeared, and lo and behold, he was working in the kitchen cooking food!!! REALLY??

I was very disappointed, and sadly will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and good options. Service was okay working zone but had a lot at the beginning and pretty much nothing at the end. Brought food with no condiments and had to keep getting up since no one came by. Overall would come back but sitting closer to the kitchen probably gets better service."}
{"text":"It's to slow we had to wait like 30-40 min and the food is ok I might come back to this location"}
{"text":"Ordered salmon benedict and surprisingly it tastes really good.  The egg is just right softly broiled. The sauce is tasty.  The fruit accompanies the benedict is fresh.

Oops the graph coming together on the dish with the mixed fruit juice isn't fresh.  What an disappointment !

Though the waitresses are very friendly"}
{"text":"This used to be an \"OK\" place. But it has become overcrowded, with long waiting list. They rush to bring you uncooked breakfast, the cheese on the omelette is not even melted and stays solid...... I stopped going to this place after their prices hiked. Paying over $30 for 2 veggie omelettes not including coffee seems a little too much for their quality of food and service."}
{"text":"I totally agreed with others here.  I ordered sunshine panini with ham all the time at different Cora locations but this place, somehow made the crepe very chewy & doughy!?!  I tried numerous times at this location during weekdays & weekends, still the crepe tasted so chewy/undercooked.  I will go back to any Cora for breakfast but not this location."}
{"text":"Disgusting place. Cockroaches everywhere and the manager guy who is also a server will make sure that your day is ruined. I asked him for a coffee and he looked absolutely annoyed. In fact every time I called he looked like he stepped on a lego or sth. Also spotted him yelling at hostesses for being slow while he was chit chatting away with one table for the entire course of my meal. Then if you complain about it, he would purposely look away and not visit your table until you call for the twentieth time. This guy doesnt deserve tips. Just give it directly to the hostesses who apparently dont get any!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first time yesterday.  The service was poor, the potatoes were under cooked, the bacon was all fat.   The blueberry crepes were inedible.  They were not pancakes nor crepes.

The omelettes are either their way or not at all.   Ok, the bagel and coffee were OK.

We would never go back."}
{"text":"A little busy here in the mornings but Thays to be expected. Good food and good service"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, but the service was not so great. The server didn't take my order so I had to ask him to come back and then when the food came out we were missing a place and it took a while for the last plate to come out (which I assume our server missed the order) 
But overall the food was yummy!"}
{"text":"No reason to give a bad review here. I haven't been in a long time. Got the undecided, and no complains. Good service, got a good spot and happy with the meal."}
{"text":"The place wasn't very busy, but the two servers were all over the place. The portions were much smaller than another location I usually frequent and done somewhat carelessly (e.g. the toast has a small patch of butter in a corner, fruit badly cut, almost no hollandaise sauce on the small crepomelet).

Unlikely I'll go to this location again."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast at Cora's.  The omelets were very good, just like the service.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been to Cora's but the first time at this location.  It was terrible the first two times I went a couple years ago, but I wasn't a Yelp member back then to write a review for them.  However, I had to write one for this location as I was terribly unhappy with the food and service.  I asked the server to make several accommodations to my dish (I like the toast a well done, and  eggs well done, hollandaise on the side, etc).  I'm not high maintenance but just felt like a special order since the one being offered on the menu needed tweaking.  Though she was friendly she said \"yes, yes, not a problem, we can do all of that\", the dish came out with NO accommodations I had requested.  The eggs were runny and the toast was barely toasted, etc.... They offered to remake it, but this time it came out 15 minutes later, still without half the things I requested, AND they charged me for the substitutions they didn't even implement!!  I spoke with the manager who offered a measly 20% off the bill.  To top it all off, the coffee was cold, the fruit wasn't peeled and the service was VERY slow... never returning!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A relax place for a Sunday breakfast. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the waitress is friendly. There's a variety of selections of food and drinks for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Their fruit bowl with yogurt is really good! Will definitely gpnna come back, their  eggs ben et dectone ham is pretty good and the wife loved it! Also love the jo construction meal! For the price, it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly enough, seating was very quick and so is service. Very polite and knows everything on menu, the server. We had a little less pricey breakfasts but you're pay'in for what you get. Good portions, definitely will come here again."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 (60% of final grade)
This was my first experience with Cora's, and I fell in love. The portion sizes, the taste, the balance of sweet and savoury/healthy and unhealthy sides-- everything was superb! The fruit was really fresh, and the coffee is bottomless!! They even had decaf for lil ol' caffeine-sensitive me!

Ambiance 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
Not much to say about the ambiance -- it was a comfy establishment. The premises felt clean enough. With a yellow smiling sun and green rounded lettering as your brand, I can't really imagine too much of an \"ambiance\" except comfy. 

Service 3/5 (10% of final grade)
The server was cold at the beginning of the meal, but began to warm up at the end of it. Most of the servers always had a coffee pot in hand, ready to refill any coffee. 

Cost 3.5/5 (10% of final grade)
Was worth. 'Nuf said. 

Brownie Points 3.5/5 (10% of final grade)
Because it's Cora's. 

Final Grade = 73/100 = 3 Stars from mom! 

TLDR: I've been converted."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of Cora's but now I'm more disappointed in terms of quality of food that is served here.

What I liked before about Cora's was the portion size and the fresh fruits. When I recently went, it seems like the price hasn't changed but the quality and portion of the food has gone downhill. I usually get the Rosemary's Sunday where you get fruits, bacon, 2 eggs and 2 blueberry pancakes. The pancakes were dull in flavour and the fruits weren't fresh as it used to be. Just lacklustre. 

I probably won't comeback after having a disappointed breakfast here."}
{"text":"Food OK but expect inattentive service and dour attitudes, sticky tables and dirty cutlery, lineup even though a dozen empty tables inside. A blemish on the Cora brand, compared to others in the chain."}
{"text":"I've heard some bad things about Cora's locations downtown Toronto, but this new location in Richmond is pretty good! It's right across the street from my work, and I've been a few times for pre-work breakfast and once for lunch.

Cora's is a chain, so no surprises with the menu here -- expect the usual fresh variety of gourmet brunch options that Cora's is famous for. My main complaint with the menu is that Cora's doesn't list the entire menu online, and they don't post any of the nutritional information either. If you're looking for something lower cal/fat I recommend Peggy's poached, which comes with a poached egg, toast, cottage cheese and fruit. I was also disappointed that they don't offer low fat cream cheese or salad dressings. Prices are a little high for breakfast, but portions are HUGE for most items.

Recently Cora's has brought out some new \"summer\" lunch salads. The Pacifico Salad (greens, smoked salmon, capers, cream cheese and a bagel) was delicious, but pretty skimpy on the greens. Cora's does indeed serve the famous Montreal bagels, which is a huge plus; only downside is they only have plain white.

Service is here is great. I've never had to wait long for a table, server or food. Breakfast on weekdays it's fairly empty, and weekdays they draw a decent crowd for lunch. Never been on weekends, but I'm sure like most Cora's locations it fills up quick.

Also, BOTTOMLESS COFFEE. If you need a pick-me-up, the combination of sugar-packed breakie with limitless caffeine will leave you tweaked and twitching."}
{"text":"Never before have I had to wait ten minutes just for the waitress to take my drink order, nor have I ever had to wait ten minutes after that to get my water, or a refill on my coffee. This never happened to me, until I came to this Cora's location. Twice I've come to this Cora's, and twice the staff has been lazy, forgetful, and improperly trained. The food is good, but all Cora's locations serve great food, so find another location because this one will just make your blood boil."}
{"text":"This is obviously a family friendly place since I pick this place so my friends' kid could order what they like to drink and eat.  I love the Cora's breakfast special as well.  The servers were friendly, but the service was quite slow.  One of the kids really want to have chocolate milk and somehow they are out of chocolate milk.  Lol.  She has to settle for orange juice.  My breakfast was quite tasty and I love the maple syrup with crispy bacons.  One of my friend's order was somehow forgotten and she didn't really get her food until 20 minutes after all of us got our food.  The place also was not jam packed which I like, but this place is subpar to any other Cora's I have been to.  I would give other Cora's at least a four star ratings.  If not for the manager being quite nice, I would give this place a 2 star only.  All in all, just an average experience for me.  I most likely would only come back if I am really craving brunch and a little short on time."}
{"text":"Maybe we caught this location on a bad day but the service was really terrible.  The waitress delivered orange juice to me which was so full that she spilled it all over the table, and didn't bother to wipe it up.  She took my coworker's order down completely wrong, so the kitchen had to redo it, which resulted in us eating separately so that mine didn't get cold.

The food itself was okay, but nothing to write home about.  The sausage was really bland, as were the home fries.  To be honest, the best part was the toast with jam, which I could have made at home!"}
{"text":"Here in town with some friends and after waiting for a crazy long time (when there were tables open. why?) we finally got sat and had a good meal. 

I had the waffles which is one thick giant waffle with strawberries piled high. Subbed Nutella for the creme. Good stuff. 

Food is good. Wait is bad."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy going to Cora's but I was not pleased at this location. I came here twice thunjing maybe the first time was just a bad day for the waiter but i was wrong. I've been to several Cora's but this one by far was the worst. First of, the service. This female seemed to be a little confused, either she is new or she didn't want to do her job? My friend and I was standing at the front waiting to be seated and this young female looks at us, then looks around, then back at us, pauses and slowly walks towards us. With no greeting, she just says \"follow me\". So we get to our seat and thankfully our server was friendlier. 
BUT the food. My omelette was falling apart. I've been to many other locations and I know how it's suppose to look like but they've put less fruits AND my omelette was not cooked properly. I can make better omelettes and it seemed as if they tried adding water to the egg mixture.  As for the table, it was quite sticky and not wiped down properly. I don't think I'll return to this location."}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend and it's the busiest time. But heck, what other time would you want to come to Cora's. Super busy, people lined up out the door. And that's the first impression I got when I arrived. There is no proper system to seat people whatsoever. There were two girls at the front counter. One was the cashier and one was the hostess taking people down to their tables. However, when the hostess was gone and people keep coming in the girl at the cashier totally ignored them. At least tell them to line up behind the sign so that when the girl comes back she can take their names. In the crowd of people at the door we were totally lost and this other person who just came in totally cut in front of us partly due to the fact that there was no organized line. She can also tell some people to wait in the outside area after they got their number and they could have cleared the space. 

In terms of service I totally agree with the other reviews, there was no organization. Tables were not being cleared fast enough and people seated. Hard to get the servers' attention and they were not attentive.

Now to the food. I ordered the Spinach and Cheddar omelette. Portions were huge and tasted pretty healthy. It also comes with potatoes which were tasty and fresh food which I appreciated. Also if you checked-in with Yelp you get a free fruit cocktail of the day, made with fresh fruits and no sugar added. Which made my experience a bit better. 

Overall, I will definitely think twice before coming here on the weekend. The process of the line-up and getting a table is a bit frustrating, which is not what I want on my weekend. Other than that the food is pretty good so if I'm ever free on a weekday I may consider coming here."}
{"text":"I love Cora!  Despite the unhealthily-sized portions (they're ginormous!), I love everything about this place.  As a franchise, I know what I'm going to get and at least I can fool myself into believing that I'm not consuming more calories than I should when I dig into the mountainous piles of fresh fruit and associated deliciousness.  I've had French toast, French toast brioche, pancakes, various sandwiches, omelets... etc, all bring on an extraordinary feeling of satisfaction that result in guaranteed smiles after brunch.  The unlimited coffee is very much appreciated, always refilled quickly, and the service is brisk.

Perhaps due to its more isolated location compared to the other franchises, I've never had issues getting a seat right away or fairly soon after arrival, which is not the case with other locations.  If you're already in the area, I would choose this location over the Warden and Highway 7 location because of this.  It's located in a giant, big-box, newish plaza where not all the units are occupied.  Plenty of free parking, credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"First of all I been a loyal Cora customer,  I been coming to them almost every other Sunday with my family 

Went here last Sunday. 

The service overall was pretty bad.   Waitress was super rude and was rushing us to order.  Even though restaurant was not busy as I normally have seen them.   She had one other table beside ours.   We were so upset that we ask her not to serve us.  Completely ruin our time there. 

We had ordered 3 dishes...  My dad's was the last to get his and there was a 10 minute time difference from the time I got mine and him getting his. The portions have shrunk,  barely got any home fries. 

We won't be returning to this Coras again. And I will forward this to their head office.   They need to train their staff and do some quality control...  I hope this review turns off people from going here."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to a Cora, but I was craving brunch on this particular Sunday and didn't feel like cooking, so I decided to give Cora a visit. What I remembered loving about Cora was the big portion size and fresh fruits on the side. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed when my husband and my order came, and the side of fruits looked pretty pathetic. The fruit was definitely not fresh and the few pieces we were given were all quite sour. I felt that the portion size was also smaller than what I used to get back in the days. For me, this wasn't a really big deal, since I was never able to finish the food, whereas this time, I was actually able to finish everything. Too bad this didn't mean a decrease in the price though.

On the positive side, service was friendly and quick. We were seated right away, and the food came within reasonable time after we ordered it."}
{"text":"This location has horrible service. I ordered an omelette yesterday and as a side, instead of fruits and bread and potatoes, I asked just for potatoes only. Easy right? NO! First they brought me the wrong order, then the manager came to explain they can't give me potatoes only as it's against policy. Really?!? Then I waited 30 minutes again while everything else got ice cold only for them to bring a small amount of potatoes on the side with the cold omelette. They removed the bread and the fruit but they added a few small pieces of potatoes despite them saying it was ok to get all potatoes during the order. And finally, in my bill, I see they charged me $3 for potatoes. So for getting nothing instead of the substitute food, I was charged $3 extra as well and no apology or explanation when I asked for it. I will never go to this location as this is the millionth time they piss me off with poor customer service and wrong orders. Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I always come to Cora's cause breakfast is my favourite meal of the day.  I love to eat breakfast cause then I feel energized for the rest of the day!  I've visited this particular location a handful of times and I do like the food and they're always consistent.  However, I do believe that on weekends, the customer service lacks a bit and I tend to have to wait a bit to get seated.  The last time I came to Cora's I got a cappuccino to start.  I was very pleased with the taste and it was much needed.  As per usual, I ordered the \"Louis the Undecided\" because.. I can never choose between savoury and sweet cause I do like a bit of both worlds.  The \"Undecided\" comes with 2 eggs, bacon and roasted potatoes served with a scrumptious crêpe filled with bananas, strawberries and creamy chocolatey-hazelnut spread.  I also customize my crêpe - with strawberries and custard only.  The crêpe is to die for.. always hits the spot!  I highly recommend this item and I really hope they keep this on the menu.  I've also had their \"Breakfast on a Cheddar crêpe\" which comes with 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausages served on a delicious Breakfast on a Cheddar crêpe. I did enjoy this, however, you must be warned that the cheddar crêpe is extremely heavy and there's enough food for two people.  Regardless of the customer service, the food outweighs the service (hands down) and I'll definitely be visiting Cora's again!

PS.  Just to let you know, if you check in, you can redeem a free 'daily cocktail'.  I have to be quite honest though, it doesn't taste that good.. unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went to this place for Sunday brunch. Not my favorite place in the world, but wanted something more on the healthy side. 

Looking at the service, the place was packed, but we were able to get a seat rather quickly. Ordered the fruit yogurt and a side of bacon (didn't want to be too healthy), and the kids got banana chocolate crepes (bananas are healthy). Server forgot to put in the bacon side and ended up not eating bacon. Automatic 1 star off for forgetting the yummy bacon. 

They were also having problems with their grill that morning so service was a little bit slow. I knew that going in so it was ok. 

The atmosphere was pretty good. Not too noisy like the other Cora on Warden and Hwy 7. There were a lot of kids though, but as I have some of my own, I could take the noise. 

The important part was the food. The kids loved the crepes and I loved the fruit yogurt. They ran out of blueberries, so I only got strawberries and banana in my yogurt. Another star docked. Be warned though, if you get chocolate banana crepes for your kids, expect there to be chocolate EVERYWHERE; or as my son says, he was covered in poop....

overall, a fund experience for the kids. 

Pro

Healthy brunch
Kids friendly and loved the food

Con

forgot the bacon...
ran out of blueberries."}
{"text":"I headed out to Cora's for the first time this weekend. There was a massive line up outside on the Sunday morning and the wait was well over 40 minutes but worth it ! The food was hot and fresh and though a little on the pricey side it definitely filled me up. I ended up getting a kid's size smoothie with the tuna melt sandwich and had to take half of it home because all the fruit on the side had me full. Great atmosphere with bright colours and a perfect way to start your day with family or friends. The staff was friendly and the young lady serving us was very kind and asked us throughout if we needed anything, even though the place was jam packed and she was attending multiple tables. Totally going back !"}
{"text":"I absolutely  love this place. It is well worth the long wait which just shows how popular it is and the menu is exquisite.  I ordered an crepomlette which was divine and also redeemed free cocktails through yelp. My husband didn't  even have a yelp account but the cashier was so patient and told us we could have two transactions to get both cocktails for free :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  This is my favorite Cora as there's normally not a long wait (if any) for a table, and food arrives at a reasonable speed.  The waitresses are very helpful also, and keeps checking back on us for refills on our coffee."}
{"text":"Hmm, I was expecting more from Cora's. Based on the price and the commercials talking about their quality, I wanted my breakfast totally perfect. Unfortunately, I didn't get the bang for the buck. This is the second Cora's I've been to and they're just not my restaurant. I like my food to get to me quick, it must be hot, portion has to be generous. Portion was decent, but not enough.. Especially breakfast. I can tank 3 eggs/sausages/bacon, home fries, pancake and toast easily.. Too bad i wasn't full. It cost $12 with tax for 3 eggs, sausage, bacon home fries and toast. I can get the same thing at eggsmart for the same price which includes pancakes too! I'm very picky with my breakfasts... Hahah

Food quality was good, but the portion to price.
Service very good, it was just slow.. Reason could be how busy it was, but I saw them serving everyone else while we were waiting.. So that wasn't cool.. 3 stars for quality and police service."}
{"text":"The quality I'd the food has decreased over the past several years and is also worse than the Yonge and Elgin Mills location. Slices of Canadian bacon is way too thin. Fruit is meager and not even close to plentiful. The actual seats in the booths are in dire need of repair, saw some duct tape on some seats. Some servers wipe food scraps onto the floor instead of collecting it to throw out. This location is not the best and needs better management."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favourite meal of the day, but I was slightly disappointed with my meal when I came here on Mother's Day with my parents for a late lunch. I've been to this location several times in the past, but something gave off the feeling that the owners had changed because the standards have slipped a little. One factor that differentiates Cora's from Sunset Grill (another breakfast restaurant I frequent) is the number of menu items offered with the combination of fresh fruit. Cora's pricing will always be higher, and I justify it with \"because there's fruit\", but when the quality and quantity of fruit isn't there, I can't justify it. 

Location wise, this franchise is great, surrounded by commercial buildings and fairly close to Richmond Hill and Markham neighbourhoods with plenty of parking. Service was great and the staff were friendly and professional. There was no wait time to be seated as it was fairly late in the afternoon close to 2pm. I had ordered the Sunshine Panini-Crêpe with Bacon while my parents ordered the Gargantuan Feast and the Jo Construction. My crêpe could have been grilled/cooked for a little longer because there was no colour to the exterior. In comparison to the photo in the menu, the crêpe was definitely not as big as it appeared in the photo. You can understanding why that might be a problem for someone who was super hungry at the time. 

Throughout the entire menu, almost all the photos had plates that were covered and plated beautifully with little to no white space, but in reality, there's lots of empty space. I find it slightly deceiving, and would much rather them just use smaller plates. the presentation of the food needs a little work, but the food tasted fine. The home fries could have been cooked a little more, because they barely had any colour to them. I understand that some fruits may not be in season all year round, however, substituting them with those that are can be an easy solution. 

Overall, my dining experience was slightly disappointing, but the food tasted fine. I'll probably visit other locations to see if some of my observations are consistent throughout or if it just applies to this particular location."}
{"text":"Horrendous health standards. I was served food with a grape covered in mold and was still charged for my food. I never eat here again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, it's hard not to go classic breaky because I love it. But I tried their new items menu which was a steak and eggs crepe type wrap thing. The steak is forgettable, possibly cooked from frozen? The crepe was nice with the eggs if you are feeling something savory. The home fries are pretty weak, I prefer them crispy and if possible full deep fried. 

My sister ordered this sausage wrapped in buckwheat entrée. She enjoyed it, the buckwheat was a crepe and I thought it was a little dry but fine nonetheless. 

For some reason I just really like diner coffee especially the bottomless stuff! 

The service had a pushy woman who doesn't speak English very clear or well so it was a bit annoying that she didn't give us much time after we sat down."}
{"text":"- I love Cora's and this was a good location- great service, yummy food. Maybe slightly expensive."}
{"text":"I entered this Corals restaurant at 12:30 pm. I had 1/2 hour. Busy day. I stood at the door for almost every minutes watching the girl punch information into their POS system. It wasn't busy. She totally ignored me. I asked her if I could seat myself. She said no and asked me to wait for a minute. When she finished she took me to a small table towards the back. I moved myself to a larger table so I could do some work. When I placed my order for Cora special #1 with coffee I was hungry.  I sat for 20 minutes. No coffee, nobody even looked over ar me. No food. It was almost 1:00 when just got up and left. Here I sit in my car writing this review drinking and Atkins shake I luckily had in my purse. HORRIBLE service at this place, folks."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten at Cora's. The first time was over a year ago, at a different location. The food was great. Service was great. Overall, the experience was great. This time, not so much. The wait was only about 15 mins, which is expected, especially on weekends. We were seated at a two-seated table, towards the back of the restaurant and between the wall and pillar. There was barely any room to move. It seemed as though the table was randomly placed there to accommodate for the wait. As I skimmed the menu, I was set on ordering the Cora's special.  Because I am avoiding starchy carbs at the moment, I asked if I could substitute the potatoes and bread for anything. I was told I would get sliced tomatoes. Other breakfast spots have offered me extra eggs, fruits or even a salad as an alternative. This did not seem like a fair replacement for 2 of the items in my breakfast. Nevertheless, I settled on getting the \"10 star omelette\" that contained bacon, ham, sausages, frankfurters, bologna, spinach, green onions, tomatoes, onions, red and green peppers, mushrooms and Cheddar cheese. I replaced the toast and potatoes for the sliced tomatoes and was given a bit of fruit as well, which somewhat compensated. I forgot to mention no onions (my fault), so I had to pick them out of the omelette and they were huge. I also ordered a side of bacon and was given 4 strips that were too overcooked. I found them more hard, than crispy. For the most part, the food was satisfactory. The omelette was fairly large. Unfortunately, the last bite of my omelette had egg shells in it, so that kind of ruined it a bit. In total, my meal was about $18 before taxes. Too over priced, for my experience. Because I've only been to this chain twice and the first time was good, I won't base my overall opinion on this one less-than-great experience and still rate it a 3/5."}
{"text":"I just came here today, and as always I am quite happy with Coras.  The lines are intimidating, and they never seem to end.  However, I suppose the turnover is not that bad, had to wait about 25 minutes today.  Our food was okay this time, nothing to cheer about.  I had been craving Eggs benny, my usual.  But today it was cold, and my boyfriends meal was a tad cold as well.  Not too sure why.  Also the Hollandaise sauce wasn't totally on point or smooth, intact a tad clumpy.  The eggs even though I ordered soft, only one of them was.  The food was still good, and the end of the day always happy with coras but sometimes its just some of the small things, that need to be mastered...."}
{"text":"Been to the one in Newmarket 3 times and was awful. So, tried the one on York Mills 4 times and only had one good experience. Usually the food arrives cold. The servers need to be properly trained. When someone is leaving half their food on the plate, they should be asking what was wrong with it. The hollandaise sauce is all broken up over the food and turns you right off. Won't ever be back nor will my friends."}
{"text":"Don't go to this location. The customer service went downhill, the place is filthy and the location needs a GOOD painting and refurnishing. WAITRESS WAS HORRIBLY RUDE, INTERRUPTING, RUDE TO A KID, AND RUSHED US, WE HAD TO LEAVE. 

Went here with my family, we got here right before closing, and the hostess let us in to sit down. As we were trying to order, our waitress kept interrupting my Father as he tried to order, and \"shushing\" my nephew (he is 4 and sometimes his voice is too loud), but this waitress (I know her name, but I don't feel like its fair to ruin her job, we will give her another chance and hope she finds herself and her soul in the future), completely RUSHED my Dad and our orders, she was so totally RUDE and it made me feel so sad that we came here on this beautiful sunny afternoon. It was a special day since my boyfriend wanted to take my Dad and nephew out to lunch and we planned on coming to Cora's for such a long time. Unfortunately its hard to get my nephew out of the house in time and we just almost missed closing. But this girl was SO RUDE, IMPATIENT, JUDGEMENTAL, INCONSIDERATE. 

I told my Father that we had to get up and leave, it wasn't worth the money to be treated this way. I wouldn't PAY to sit in this girl's presence any longer, and not to mention the way she was disrespecting my father. We got up getting ready to leave and I asked the waitress for her name as she began to cry, she knew that what she did was wrong. All the other staff saw and knew what was going on. 

I hope she got disciplined and learned her lesson, and I think its only fair to explain what happened here. I do not have the heart to disclose her name online. As if I was in this situation as the server, I would wish to have a second chance and learn from my mistakes, and grow as a person.

What really peeved me off was the fact that I could tell she was just in it for the money and not doing her job to make and give good energy and a good experience to a family. I work at a grocery store, and when customers come up to me and ask me questions or for help, I always smile and go the extra mile to make their day enjoyable. That is just who I am. having a miserable human being, only existing for her tip and to make some $$, not caring about the quality of life she is providing in her presence, is just INTOLERABLE for me. 

Anyway, the service here sucks. Go to the one in Vaughan."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Cora's and I can definitely say that I'll be back very soon. 

They serve breakfast until 3pm so it was pretty busy being a Sunday afternoon. The wait time to get a table was probably around 10 minutes and the wait time for our food was about 10 minutes as well. The food was DELICIOUS! And I was very impressed by the variety of options there was to choose from, made it so hard to narrow down to once choice. Even looking around at other tables, everything looked delicious and the presentation was beautiful. 

I ordered a burrito that was filled with eggs, beans, veggies that came with sour cream and salsa, as well as a side of roasted potatoes. YUM! It was actually an item off the Teen menu so I was a bit scared the portions were going to be tiny bit I couldn't even finish my meal. My sister had the Cora's special which she enjoyed and couldn't finish either. With most of the meals I saw there was a side of fruit as well. And as a side note, the prices are decently priced. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary there  

FYI, while checking into Cora's on my Yelp app, I received a coupon for the cocktail of the day with any purchase of a meal over $7 (which most meals are anyways) for free! I got my smoothie on the spot for free = me a happy camper. So it totally pays to check-in ;)

As I said before, I would definitely come back to Cora's and will recommend them to everyone!"}
{"text":"We're lucky we found this place for breakfast and lunch. Good food, elegantly served by friendly staff. Food is fresh and you can tell the care that goes into each dish. Definitely highly recommend this place, also good for kids"}
{"text":"The fresh-fruit topped french toast was amazing and was very filling--too filling for me, in fact. That's my problem; I have a generally poor appetite and get full and sometimes bloated very quickly. But for those that want an energizing breakfast and don't have any significant digestive ailments, why not this place?

The servers are super friendly and the food came fast. The Coffee was pretty good for a diner too--not watered down. At a little over $10 this was fairly priced."}
{"text":"Be ready for long line ups on the weekend! I got into the restaurant at around 12:30-1:00ish. Waited around 20 minutes and got a table. There were actually a lot of empty seats but my guess is they did not have enough people to clean and get the tables ready.

Pros:
-Food came really quickly and our waitress was awesome:)
-Portions were huge. I Ordered the Theo's omelette and couldn't even finish half of it

Cons:
-unlike other Coral restaurants, this location looks pretty run down and old. 
-long line up on the weekend"}
{"text":"Ambience & decor: Colourful paint & cheerful decor.

Food & service: Staff is friendly but do not have their act together. We had to ask for water, coffee, extra napkins, & other things several times. Service is 2 star at best.

The menu has been updated to make it more interesting & not just a mound of fresh fruit with a little something on the side. We had stopped going to this place because of this, limited choices, along with pricey food -- not to mention the service not being good. I wanted to give it another try after a few years. 

Update: The food & menu choices are very good now. Food overall is pricey but a 4 star. The portion sizes are quite filling. Fresh fruit choices & quantity are also adequate instead of being a mound of fruit! 
We might try their other location to see if service is better. This is a good diner with potential to be a fantastic diner but whether the branches do a good job remains to be seen. My rating could have been an easy 4 star but looks like they need to get their act together like other diners for instance Eggsmart."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, very happy with what had over there... Mary, (I think the name of our waitress) was very friendly and professional, and made my day.. :) . definitely worth to go back!"}
{"text":"The portions were ridiculously small here. Very disappointing considering the high price tag of this breakfast spot. Pancakes were cold and seemed like they had been cooked an hour before we arrived... Definitely won't be returning to this Cora's location."}
{"text":"Horrible service. At least an hour wait for the food. No one come to fill up my empty coffee mug until 10mins later. Our server told us she checked and our food is on the way when we asked about it. Half an hour later, our server came to our table and told us she didn't put in the order. Made us wait another half an hour for the food."}
{"text":"We came on labour day and there was quite a large crowd. The waitstaff were a bit delayed; understandable having a fair amount of customers. Two parties at my table ordered a western and 'Gigi' omelette, respectively. They seemed to enjoy it, along with some fruit. My sons food was delayed, a grilled crepe, which came messy and cold. Not sure if it was even grilled. Mine was a generic turkey sausage and eggs over easy. Coffee is not included, so before tax the total was over $60.00. For breakfast, Coras would not be a typical first choice. It is pricing the the quality does not compensate. Eggsmart a block west (previously reviewed) is just as busy, but fresh quality and more attentive service. I would still rate 3 stars overall, but don't expect to have a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Just left Cora great service.
Pleasant servers clean bathrooms.
Great food.
Will return."}
{"text":"Firstly, if I were to review just the service of this place, I would give it 5 stars, as we were 10 people today and our server handled us amazingly.

However, about the food, there had been a drastic change in their menu. THERE IS NO BEEF ANYMORE :(

They have replaced pretty much everything that came with beef, to ham; I was going to order eggs Benedictine with beef only to find out that beef had been eradicated from their menu. My poor stomach had to settle for brie cheese and mushroom."}
{"text":"Cora's is always consistent and the same is true for this location. I'm a fan and will travel to go to one for breakfast. I like the healthy choices available with fruit. I can recommend this chain to anyone but one needs to understand that the quality is good, but not over the top amazing."}
{"text":"Surprisingly it was not busy when I went here this morning (must have just beaten the morning crowd at about 9:30am) so me and my friend was seated pretty quickly.  I have been here a few times before.  The food is pretty standard...nothing to jump for joy about.  I had the eggs au gratin.  It comes with side fruit and toast.  It was ok...the flavours were nice but it just needed some oomph!  The portions are hearty so if you are really hungry and want a decent price then come here.  I come here only when its been so long that I have forgotten what the food tastes like."}
{"text":"The problem with this Cora's is how poorly managed it is. They are incredibly busy all the time, yet they have no clue how to seat customers. People will finish their meal and leave their table and the staff will either:

a) ignore the abandoned table that needs to be bussed for far too long
or 
b) they'll buss the table and let the clean empty table just sit there empty while ignoring people waiting to be sat because they prefer to seat in the order you arrive. 

Let me break that down for you: if you are 10th on the list and you are a party of 4 and there are 9 party of 2's ahead of you and there is an empty table for 4, they will leave that empty table for 4 and let you wait 20 minutes while they seat the 9 parties of 2 ahead of you. At tables for 2. While that table for 4 remains empty--lonely even. They could have sat you instantly but they for some reason they don't. Occasionally, they'll seat two people at a 4 top and then a 2 top will open and they can't seat you. I've never seen a restaurant do this and they've done this for years. Only this location. It's dumb. And they are losing business because of it. 

That said, the food is always good, the portions are ginormous, and once you actually get seated the waitstaff is helpful and sweet.

I usually get the oatmeal (made with water) with strawberries and cinnamon. There's an option for Cora's \"Ode to Oatmeal\" which is topped with granola, berries, maple syrup and English cream--a little too heavy for my tastes. My companions get the glutenous stuff. Strawberry Waffles are usually a hit (PRO-TIP: with Nutella swapped for the custard) as well as the Gargantuan Feast which is just that: 2 eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, Canadian peameal bacon, blueberry pancake and roasted potatoes. All served with your choice of toast. (By the way, toast comes with jellies, jams and peanut butter!) 

It's convenient and the food is good, which is why we keep coming back, but the long lines and dreadful seating management take it down a star and crush your soul."}
{"text":"Our bartender recommended this place to us for breakfast and to our surprise it was just across the street from our hotel. We have it a try and waited nearly 35 minutes for a table on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered and two of the three entrees we ordered were incorrect but the server discounted both by 50% each. The food came in fairly large portions, especially the banana crepe (we added strawberries to it, too). If you like fresh fruit, this is definitely a great spot for you as they serve many dishes with lots of it. Overall, the food was good."}
{"text":"Just ate at the Coras here, ordered 2 Egg Benedicts with ham, and a pancake meal with eggs and bacon. 

The service overall was pretty bad, we waited 25 minutes for our food and it didn't come until we asked our waitress about it. Instead of apologizing for the delay she gives us attitude about asking for our food. Somehow after checking on it she brings it right away (which was nice). However she was still very stand offish, and overall not very nice.

The pancakes came lukewarm, but we didn't want to send it back so we ate it anyways. The Benedicts were fine and overall the food tasted okay, what you'd expect from this type of restaurant. 

When we went to pay the bill, the waitress had the audacity to ask us to \"relax next time\" which we found appalling. 

We won't be returning to this Coras again."}
{"text":"The service and food has usually been mediocre at this location, but on our last visit both were very poor. While being seated our server told the host not to put us in her area since she is already too busy. Food took a long time to come out and our hash browns were cold and the omelette unappealing which the server even said herself."}
{"text":"I've been to Cora's many times and every time I go I swear an oath not to ever go again.

My experiences at Cora's are not consistent: some days the food is good and some days its terribly terribly wrong. On my last encounter at Cora's, I got the 1990's harvest, which I ordered expecting french toast or something french toast tasting. Instead, I got a \"cinnamon raisin brioche,\" which was not dipped in french toast batter (like it claimed to be) and was not even a second cousin of french toast. I was a little disappointed, but I carried on and took a bite, I was still disappointed. The cinnamon raisin brioche was stale, hard as a rock, and definitely tasted store-bought. My eggs were not runny like I asked and my coffee cup was empty majority of the time there.

Cora's ain't cheap, take your money elsewhere and enjoy a brunch where your eggs are not well done every single time."}
{"text":"Love Coras! One of my favourite breakfast spots. 
This location's service is a bit slow but the food is always great.

I would suggest the Rosemary's Sunday (because it had a little bit of everything; from eggs, sausage and home fries to pancakes) or the tuna melt. Delish!"}
{"text":"Waited for over forty mins and we found out that they have taken our name from the list because someone else took our sits instead.  Food was just okay, they forgot the toast."}
{"text":"Stepped into the Canadian version of IHOP, only healthier (most entrees served with fresh fruit)! Big menu with lots of choices......"}
{"text":"Good food and service though the line is ridiculous. Not a fan of the pancakes but the poached egg and crepe were respectable."}
{"text":"*Review for 5/4/2014
After running a half marathon, all I wanted was lot of carbs and syrup.  Since this Cora's location was near my hotel, I decided to try it out.  It was packed but the wait was short.  Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu. 

Simply, I wanted French toast with lots of syrup.   I order the seventh of July , but I asked for the fruit to be placed on the side. The French toast was hot and good, but it wasn't a stand out.  There wasn't anything special about the whole experience; it was simply ok.
  
With the Yelp check-in,  I received a free fruit cocktail. I ordered the mango banana one. Again, it was simply ok. I'm sure if I would order it again since I am not a fan of bananas. 

Overall, my experience wasn't bad, and it was convenient to my hotel. If you haven't eaten at a Cora's, then it would  definitely be worth a try. You may find something on the menu that stands out to you."}
{"text":"I kinda like this brunch place. A long waiting line though. People who serve me were nice. Had a little brunch here today."}
{"text":"My lunch stop today. Not bad. I had the Ham & Cheese Crape with sliced fruit. It was hot (in temp) & had a decent flavour profile. Nothing else added to the meal."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:30am (Saturday), we were greeted promptly and seated within a few minutes. The food met expectations- very consistent with other Cora locations. 

Extra star for the service which was spot on- not too overbearing but available when we needed. 

Large pieces of fudge at the cashier was a great touch (not all locations have sweets at the cash, if they have fudge it's normally cut into tiny servings).

This might actually be one of the Cora locations I prefer going to."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Worst place I've been in my entire life - no exaggeration. Would give it zero stars if I could. I'm not into chain restaurants but all we wanted was simple bacon and eggs. Easiest thing in the world to make but it was inedible. All our food was cold, rubbery and flat out gross. I had to send mine back. Service was also painfully slow from beginning to end. I don't like to post bad reviews but I want their management to read this because clearly they have issues running this place and need to improve. 

Eat ANYWHERE but here."}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast chain!
I am a regular for 3 years now, or maybe I am addicted to Cora's. Cora's is the only breakfast place that offers o much variety of vegetarian food. Recently they have added 3 more vegetarian options to their lunch menu: Mexican crepe, veggie burgers and classic veggie skillet. All 3 are as good as they can be. I love their coffee too, sometimes I buy their coffee beans for home. Their crepes, waffles and fruit platter are just as amazing as their lunch menu, or any granola bowl. I am so hooked on their fudge. 

The portions are huge! And they use the quality products and items are served fresh. None other breakfast place has so many vegetarian options. I have been to multiple locations of Cora's, here and in Montreal. This one is my pet now. 

Cons: They can do better with their potatoes.

And Yelp check-in gets you a free smoothie! yippie. They have a loyalty card, ask for it. Every 13th meal is free. No catch!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst Cora's I've been to, and I've been to about 10 (I'm usually a big fan). While the food wasn't terrible, the service was absolutely awful. The servers were yelling at each other in a different language (some kind of Asian language) and we just weren't taken care of at all. They forgot our toast, they didn't bring us ketchup or condiments, no syrup for the crepes, and they didn't bring us  the waters we ordered. Our entire experience was spent flagging down servers to bring us our orders that they forgot. Also no apologies were given. Our toast wasn't even toasted and they forgot to butter it! Not coming back here!"}
{"text":"I love Cora breakfast, if you go late you have to stay in lines. I ordered egg with bacon , sausage and pancake, it was delicious but it's pricey"}
{"text":"I wish yelp had 0 star! this place is the worst cora i have ever been to in my entire life! We went to the Cora around 10 am. There was only half seats filled. However, we waited half an hour to get our order and everything was cold! Bacon was soft! whipped cream melted! We complained about it. All they did was just giving us an extra COLD fries... Highly not recommended for everyone. Plz go to any other Cora locations if you don't want to ruin your weekend brunch with your families."}
{"text":"very bad ..food and fruit they serve not fresh..very bad quality...
no to considerate again...
for 40$ couple EAT BREAKFAST for some fruit not even fresh and bad taste..
better to go Tim hurton.."}
{"text":"I attended this location today and I went with a group (no reciveration)  They fit us in with no problem!!  Great!  

We order the drinks first and then later the food (after the drinks). 

Negative:
 like others we had to wait for them the come time no idea but we were hungry
 No refill on Water 3 of us did
 did not ask if the other at the table could want tea or coffee after

Postive
Set us together on 30 miunts noticed GREAT
could get single bills (PERFECT) 
The amount of food was nice but some of it was cold or not too hot!
The witter and host was nice and friendly


Would i go back but with the same group cause the table talk was great and outway the negative points!"}
{"text":"First off i wanna say this cora is so much better than the cora at hwy 7 and warden. My egg white omelette is perfect and fluffy and the portion is bigger than the other cora, the salad that subbed the fries are very tasty and fruits are fresh. The water cups look so much more sanitary as well

The servers are also very efficient and friendly :) 
Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I think the food for this location is far better than the one at Warden/HWY7.  Atmosphere is better as well since it's new.  Portion is big and fruit is fresh, always a good start for a day."}
{"text":"I live nearby and always come here. This location can get a little busy, but I rarely have to wait long. Staff is always friendly and efficient! The food is great, my favourite is the 10 Star Omelette and 10 Star Skillet (because I don't like having to use my hands when eating, which means public washroom trips to wash my hands after). Portions are huge! They always refill your coffee too.

Will continue coming here over and over again!"}
{"text":"Large location - arrived at 745am and it was well understaffed for the amount of customers that were there.   Service was extremely good though.   Food took quite a while to get to the table and some customers walked over to the sever to be the next to order.   Food was on par with other cora's."}
{"text":"I work across the street so I visit this place quite often. The quality of this place has really gone down over time. Last time I went, the bacon was not cooked enough.. so we asked for them to put it back on the grill/pan longer and it came back burnt... the fruit on the side had an almost-rotten strawberry. Service is on the poor side too because they are very short staffed. On Fridays, you would always come in and find at least 4 or5 tables that havent been cleaned up yet because they are too busy."}
{"text":"This Cora location is the second-closest one to home. I also tend to visit this one more than any other location.

This restaurant is located in a strip mall with a few other eateries, such as Tim Hortons, Subway, and Turtle Jack's. I have never had a problem with finding a parking spot.

As with any Cora restaurant, if you are planning on having breakfast, it's best to get there either early or come in later on in the day. I like this one because it is roomy and the food is consistent.

I tend to go with crepes and French toast. You get a ton of fruit with most selections. The food is simply yummy. I don't go out for breakfast too often, but it's a treat when I do.

Staff here have already treated me well. No complaints at all here!

{"text":"location - conveniently located across the street from westin hotel where i was staying.
food - the fruit platter with brie looked just like the picture! and the fruit was all fresh but it was such a large platter of fruit thati had to take more than half of it back to the hotel.
smoothie of the day was only ok (tasted more like applesauce), but tried it since it was free with yelp check in. 
service - just ok, it wasn't busy, but there seemed to be a delay in getting water and ordering. there was also some confusion at the register - took 3 people to take care of the 2 customers waiting to pay."}
{"text":"Here's why this place deserves 2 stars.

One has to only look at the quality of food and quality of ingredients to see that this chain has become a money-making machine for its owners. They don't give a **** about putting their soul into making delicious breakfasts. Their chefs are probably underpaid and do the bare minimum to get their paycheque. You can feel it by the way the food is made.

I bet you that had the owners valued nutrition and quality of ingredients, they would not be churning out conveyor belt-type food like at some roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Let's be honest. Their food is meant for the average consumer who doesn't give a **** about authenticity and quality of ingredients. The average customer at Cora probably wants a 900+ calorie breakfast in order to stuff their face with food, regardless of how it was made.

I was appalled at the quality of their pancakes. They were incredibly dry. Most likely, made of the cheapest dough possible. I had to eat them because I did not have a choice. The fruit plate came with a half-ripe kiwi that you couldn't possibly eat. And $3.75+tax for a glass of Tropicana orange juice? Are you kidding me? If you call yourself a breakfast place, you ought to be able to offer freshly squeezed orange juice for that price.

Our bill was $46 for 1 order of pancakes with fruits, a fruit plate, 2 coffees, 1 juice and English cream as an extra. IMHO, that's too expensive. We had an amazing lunch at a quality Greek restaurant on Danforth the day before for the same price. Believe me, we got a lot more value out of that meal.

Look, Cora, I aint comin' back, that's for sure. You failed to make a good impression on me due to your lack of attention to detail and your focus on squeezing as much profit out of every customer who walks through the door without actually providing a great meal in return. How do I know that? I could feel it by looking at the food on my plate.

If you want to recapture your \"mojo\", I would suggest to start off with a clean slate. Overhaul your menu by consulting with your chefs. Make sure your waiters, waitresses, and people working in the kitchen are adequately compensated, in order for them to love their craft. Start using quality ingredients and start giving a damn about the people who walk through your door. Stop feeding them crap filled with empty calories and start offering a variety of healthy high-quality breakfast options. I've been to such places and you are, unfortunately, not one of them."}
{"text":"Good reliable place for breakfast nearby our house. Service is good most of the time. Will return again. They are generous with their bread."}
{"text":"This is the second Cora's I've been to so far, and I have to admit that I was quite impressed with this location. I came here for Sunday brunch with several friends and although the place was bustling, the service was great. There was a line out the door.

I ordered a Sunshine Panini Crepe and it was delicious. A nice, unhealthy complement to the plate of fresh fruit. My friends took advantage of the bottomless coffee. Did I mention that the service was really good? It was a game to see if you could finish the cup of coffee before the servers come by the refill."}
{"text":"The menu is huge and awesome.
The quality is meh.  We've gone a handful of times and we ALWAYS get really sad fruit (some with rot spots) on the saddest piece of lettuce ever (wilted and gross).
My sister has been to a few locations, so we gave them a couple of tries, but I think we're done.
Several times the radio was blaring horrible static and the staff refused to change the channel or turn it down despite the interference. 
Really itched our ears and brains during our fam brunch.
The service is generally slow.
The hostess are usually disinterested and phoney friendly (really off putting).
We ordered an extra meal for take out and when we got home, it was completely a different menu item."}
{"text":"The first time we came here service was OK and all the meals arrived at the same time, however since then service has gone downhill. The last time we were there it was the last straw, 5 of us sat down for breakfast. I asked for a glass of water and am still waiting for it. All the meals arrived except mine, and when it finally arrived The eggs Benny was stone cold so I sent it back. 

If you all get bacon and eggs all is fine but try ordering a crepe, eggs Benny, an omelet and a smoothie and everything seems to fall apart.

After 3 consecutive bad service experiences we have taken our breakfast business elsewhere"}
{"text":"Cora offers a fabulous breakfast & lunch menu and huge portions. This location is great, service and food were spot on!  My first check in garnered a free fruit cocktail coupon. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Bunch of friends visited Cora's over the weekend. There was a long line and we had to wait for over half n hr to b seated.. We were 6 of us and everyone checked-in but u can redeem only one free cocktail per bill.. Coming to the food.. We ordered crepomelettes and theos omelette.. Crepomelette was a disappointment.. Too much liquid cheese and the taste of the crepe + omelette was not good at all.. Theos was good but i would prefer eggsmart's veg omelette over it anytime.. Mango banana smoothie could have been better with a little more of mango flavor.. All in al a very average experience"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday brunch and was a little surprised that it wasn't  packed. I haven't  been tona Coras in a few years but the one that I have been to was packed and need to line up to get a seat. Once seated the waitress seems to be rushing us to order which I don't  get why because it wasn't  packed anyway. There was this constant pressure to order and get going. Finally ordered the Rosemary's Sunday and was a little dissapointed in terms of the proportions. My memories of Coras is that they offer a lot of fruit on the plate and it seems like I barely got any. The overall food quality was average nothing too spectacular. Not sure if I would want to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Normally, I expect and have always been provide with clean food here, not greasy, and very fresh. This location is disappointing. Both times I came here my grapes that were added to my dish as a garnish were molded. The service was great though. Very friendly staff and accommodating. Food is zero, staff is five stars so...Im leaving it with a three star review."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch place. I always go before 9:30am..after you have to wait at least 30m...The waiting line is loooooooong........I love egg Benedict and smoothly..."}
{"text":"Wait time quoted: 40 minutes.
In the meanwhile at least 6 tables remained empty.  Under staffed?  Perhaps.  Was watching one server making her way to one section of the restaurant, only to suddenly turn around to go to another section to clear another table.  
Once seated, our server came several times to get our orders, which we weren't ready for.  Food came in a decent time, except my eggs were rather brown from over cooked.
Their potato fries were good.
No one came to refill my glass of water until towards the end of my meal.
Meh."}
{"text":"This is a good place  with a nice breakfast. 
Service is good and suitable for a weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"Can someone come from Cora's corporate and visit this  location? If people only visit here they'll think that Cora's is a mediocre expensive rip off. 

Its's been a while since I've been at this particular Cora's and wow - talk about  quality downgrade. Two weeks ago I was at one in Mississauga and it was fantastic. Just like what you expect from a Cora's. Large generous portions. Tonnes of fruit. Not here. There's no excuse for that, not when the other was  a fine.

I had a pretty pathetic looking breakfast. When the milestones breakfast is better and cheaper than the Cora's breakfast you know something is wrong.

It's pretty obvious that the ownership has changed and is the new management trying to recoup their money back as quickly as possible whether quality and corporate standards are met or not?

This used to be my favourite Cora's. Not anymore. 

I'm only going here if I have no choice and somdone else is paying"}
