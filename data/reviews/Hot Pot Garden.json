{"text":"Excellent service! Food is very high quality, yummy and healthy.  Definitely check it out if you want to try the very first and authentic coconut chicken hotpot in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Service is horrible!! Only two servers serving the whole restaurant, the server even forgot our order until 15 mins later. Why would you need to wait for long time for the dishes come to your table since those are just uncooked hot pot ingredients?? Will never come back"}
{"text":"We have waited for 45 minutes and we do not even have tea or water. There are only 2 people working on a Saturday to serve 15 tables. This business model is unsustainable especially with only raw ingredients. Don't think this will stay in business long. Avoid unless you want to kill time."}
{"text":"Unlike the traditional hotpot. I love the soup and the house made secret dipping sauce. Really healthy and won't gain weight! Love it"}
