{"text":"food was s**t no one inside except cook/owner and a waitress,
 it was late at night near closing, only thing i could find open.  I don't like chinese food to begin with cept rice, chicken and beef teriaki

 ok, so i order rice with butter or gravy if they have it, no such luck, plain rice i think ok i can deal with that, WRONG!
how can you f**k up plain rice!?

along with the rice i found bits of boiled eggs, onions, bits of red & green peppers, corn, some bits of meat i couldn't recognize and something else, it tasted awful!  took about 10 bites total till i seen the various bits at the bottom then got a whiff of the egg it made me gag!

so i spit the last bite out downing what i had with water and took it to the hotel room, left it with a note \"free chinese food eat me\" no one touched it I found it later in the trash can..

Those that ate here and think the food is even \"ok\" have no sense of smell or tastebuds, or they are stoned and will eat anything 0 stars for food taste and quality.
 i do give them credit for willing to serve me so late when all the staff went home, wait wasn't too long 10-15 mins"}
{"text":"I had previously reviewed the Golden Palace buffet, stating that it was some of the worst Chinese food I've had.  Well, this place manages to be worse than it.

The place is rather run down.  The buffet was really terrible.  Food left to sit out in just its oil and a barely lit heat source.  It just wasn't a great environment.  Try something else, definitely!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is at best mediocre, but it deserves something better than 1 star given the good service. Every other place in the neighborhood was either packed or seemed like it would have slow service so we decided to come in here despite it looking like it was closed with no one inside. We were served very quickly, as promised, and it's not the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I know, that's not saying a lot, but given the limited options in the area, it may be worth knowing about this place as a possible alternative."}
{"text":"I think I'm spoiled when it comes to Chinese buffet because I live in an area with fantastic buffets. Liang's buffet is not great. It fills your stomach but that's about it. Their buffet has a smaall selection of so-so Chinese food. On the plus side, service is good and there are times late at night when this restaurant is the only one along this block still open. That's worth keeping in mind if a convention is keeping you busy until late at night."}
{"text":"1.5 stars.  I agree with Eszter, this deserves 2 stars only because of the service.  A sad little \"Chinese\" buffet with a smattering of overcooked options.  Soups were borderline offensive.  There probably won't be a wait!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese food I've had. Ever. And Pittsburgh has some pretty bad Chinese places.  The Golden Palace buffet is bad, but at least edible.  I am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Dined in. Food had obviously been sitting out all day at the buffet. Lo Mien was soggy and had unidentified black grit in it.  Broccoli was clearly unwashed whenever it was cooked. Finally I ordered beef with broccoli and the meat looked pale like chicken but tasted to gamey to be chicken or beef. First time I ever wondered if I was being served cat."}
