{"text":"Service was quick and efficient.  Stopped in for breakfast around 10 a.m.  Food was good and reminded me of a Waffle House (eggs, sausage patties, hash browns, pancakes, biscuits) no waffles.  Biscuits were much better than expected: tall and fluffy and tasted great.  As another reviewer stated, \"Very basic...a breakfast place\".  Difficult to maneuver due to on-going Independence Blvd. construction, front side parking very tight but much larger space around back.  Would go again if in the area but would not make a special trip to go there."}
{"text":"This is what a diner should be.  Is is shiny and new? No. Bells and whistles? No gimmicks.  Great service.  Coffee refills, without rubbernecking or flagging down someone.  Simple menu, reasonable choices, more than reasonably priced.  Surprisingly, I've never had to wait a long time to be seated; and this on a Saturday for breakfast.  I love this place and the friendly unpretentious people that make it run."}
{"text":"While not the fanciest place, it seemed clean and the people were friendly.
The service was good and the prices inexpensive.  I liked the place! The food was tasty and they had alot of good diner food that you can get 24/7."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, And for what it is a \"Diner\" Eggs are always poached excactly the way i asked, my wifes always gets the french toast and is delicoius, coffee is always hot and nice and strong not watered down and weak like some other area diners,  staff is super nice and patient with my small children,  You will have to wait on the weekends though.  I have also frequented this place after a late nite out with the boys,  perfect after \"bar\" \"club\" type of place as well.  Place is always very clean.  crowd is from all walks of life young and old.   I Hope it remains another 30 years"}
{"text":"This place kind of reminds me of the restaurant my grandparents used to take me to when I was a kid.  The kind of down home looking place where no one would suspect mobsters to meet and plan their various activities over coffee.  I'm kidding of course, but I really do like this place.  The food is good and it's great for people watching.  So the next time you're hung over and need some good pancakes, or just an inconspicuous spot to plan your next bank heist you know where to come."}
{"text":"Had a late night meal and I gotta say that this place is pretty bottom rung of the ladder even for a diner. The inside is very filthy and the food is sub par. Actually, the onion rings were good here. They didn't have too much batter on them so you could actually taste the onion. As for the burger and fries...I guess I could at least say it was filling. The waitress was friendly as well as the cashier but you kinda got the feeling they didn't really want to be there much more than I did."}
{"text":"A decent little Greek operated diner. I've only had breakfast here on a few occasions. I've always had good service and good food. The wait staff are very friendly and attentive. The bottom of my coffee mug was never dry."}
{"text":"Ok first, this place has been around a long time and I have been eating there for years.

The owners are still the same, and yes, most of the time going to the present, I am questioning how they can be so rude with an attitude that we are being a pain in their butt by placing an order and we should be somehow privileged they are allowing us to eat their food.

Now, the wait staff is a different story. They are always polite and courteous. They just do not apparentely get what their duties are as a waitress. Do I wish when there are only 4 customers in the restaurant with just as many waitresses, they spend a bit of time to at least attempt to fill my coffee cup more then once? Yes, absolutely. If im eating breakfast, I want coffee.Eating eggs over medium, bacon, sausage, grits, hashbrowns, toast and etc, all of the above loses its luster if my coffee cup is empty. It is a good breakfast for the money, not as good as others, but still good for the $$'s and they serve breakfast til 4pm, I think.

My last visit 1 week ago today at approx 1pm. I was 1 of 2 tables. There were no other customers. Plenty of waitresses, all debating who was leaving at what time since it was 1pm and obviously any rush they had was over so they were all sitting near the other customer(s) table who were obviously regulars discussing this while chatting with the folks at the other table.. With my  coffee cup empty, I stopped eating thinking it cant be long til they 'check on me and refill my coffee cup'. I even made it clear when I stopped eating that I was looking around trying to get somebodies attention. When another waitress, sitting next to mine chatting with the other customer, looked at me I immediately held up my coffee cup and pointed at at. She then informed my waitress who immediately looked over and said \"i'll be right there\".

She didnt come! I finished my breakfast with no coffee, no water. When she came over to leave my bill on the table a short while later, she looked at the empty coffee cup and empty water glass and didnt say a single word. 

OK, the food. While not even close to similar diners, in fact not even in the same ballpark, the food is what it is. The basics and affordable. Nothing more. I will say with breakfast, it comes out great everytime. Eggs cooked exactly as ordered every time. Decent bacon, sausage, livermush, grits hashbrowns, fresh toast etc....

Lunch, again, always decent for the money, you likely will not leave disappointed or still hungry while at the same time you will not be rushing out telling others 'oh my, this place is terrific...go there, you'll love it'.

There are quite a few similar places you actually would leave so satisfied that you want to eagerly tell others.

Liberty east is not in that category. They are in the category of affordable diners you likely wont get sick/food poisoning after eating and will leave satisfied and full belly.

Nothing too great, but nothing to awful. Your basic diner which will satisfy most. 

I'll be back. I have other diners I eat at that are so much better its absurd to compare, but sometimes where you are and your schedule/timeframe dictates where you eat, and while many are far better, I have no qualms with continuing to eat there if that is what my schedule dictates. I know I'll leave with a full belly, and while not jumping for joy wanting to tell others, I also wont be complaining & telling others to stay away.

So give it a shot. If your expectations are reasonable, you should leave satisfied with a full belly, which is what a dinner like this is good for/intended for.

I do know next time im there for breakfast, Im simply going to tell them to fill up a carafe with coffee and leave it on my table, which should make their job easier and I'll have enough coffee to get me thru the meal.

Likely 3 stars, but im giving it 2, not because my coffee cup remained empty, but because they had more waitresses then customers all laughing it up and even after getting there attention, I still did not get a refill on coffee or water, which when delivering my bill, she clearly saw and didnt even say a word.

Enjoy it for what it is. Good, nothing outstanding, but decent, filling and affordable."}
{"text":"Looking for a 24-hr diner with filling meals and good prices?  Liberty East fits the description.  I've been going there faithfully for about 2 years.  If you drive on Independence Blvd. past 11 PM, you will see the parking lot is full of cars.   

Yea, the decor is dated and the owner is grumpy, but the food is what keeps me coming back. There are a few waitresses that have been there for quite a while are they give consistently good service.  The younger waitresses are hit-and-miss in their service.  You can get a gut-busting gyro and fries for less than $6 or breakfast complete with egg, grits, toast/hashbrowns and meat for around $5.   

I would not recommend going after 9 PM or so, you will run into the club and bar-goers sobering up.  If you don't mind that, this is your place."}
{"text":"The only problem with this place is that its hard to get to due to the construction on independence blvd. other then that i love this diner it reminds me of a diner up north they are quick and friendly and the food is yummy. Well I only get breakfast here but the breakfast is very yummy."}
{"text":"This place is a place to eat after a night of drinking and dancing. I went to another usual spot for that, but they were closed. However, this place is just another place as a back up and a nice diner food type of restaurant. 

I ordered the $5.55 eggs, hasbrowns, toast, and sausage on the menu. It was awesome, I ate it with no complaints. I usually order the Philly Cheese Steak, but I thought it was a little late for something so hearty. Inside it's just like diner seating, nothing special.

The place is open mostly anytime of the day, as far I can remember about their open and closing times. Prices are cheap, mostly everything under $10. This place is one of those hidden gems to me in the Queen City, as most people don't know about it and end up going to Waffle House."}
{"text":"This 5 star review is very different from most of my others. 
This is a 5 star perfect run of the mill, ridiculously consistent, super friendly, makes me feel warm inside type of diner. But don't mistake it for anything else, it is a diner. A classic 24 hour, gets eggs & bacon whenever you want type of place.
Service is top notch (especially Sara & Myra) as well as most of the others. Coffee is always fresh and kept warm and full in my cup. Food is more consistent than other other restaurant I have been to in CLT. I know exactly what is getting put in front of me, and for a great price.
I have learned to order my hash browns well done, because otherwise they are kinda raw in the middle, but they accommodate to any request with a smile. 
Dinner plates are all great that I have tried as well, their brown gravy has a hint of cinnamon & nutmeg in it. A bit different, but once I got used to it I loved it! 
I almost feel my wife and I are here \"too often\" but for great price and a wait staff who knows your \"regular\" this is my go to place for eats any time of day."}
{"text":"A yummy little diner! They serve all sorts of food but I recommend breakfast. They serve the food fast too. The staff is extremely friendly and \"regulars\" have been coming for a decade!"}
{"text":"This is a late night grub spot that has down-home country style breakfast dishes served around the clock, twenty-four hours baby!  I haven't really been here during the day only because I love my breakfast late at night or early in the morning.  

You can tell that their are a lot of regulars even at night, because the older waitress serving the man beside me already knew what he was going to have.  I always order the veggie omelet, two biscuits, and a side of grits (with sugar, it sounds weird but you need to try it).  

I don't really mind smoke, but if you do mind, try another place.  The service is good, the prices are comparable to The Waffle House, and the entertainment is free.  You can witness a lot of different walks of life here if you hit it up at the right time.  Skip Huddle House and come to Liberty East."}
{"text":"There aren't enough of these \"greasy spoon\" places in the Queen City. I was here a couple of years back (when they still let people smoke in restaurants) and it was good then (other than the smoke). Now, it's the same tables, the same waitresses (I think) and it's the same exact food - grilled and fried excellence.

Typical breakfast options (eggs and...) and the usual non-egg meals that I tend to expect in a diner. Rather than a grilled cheese, my brain took me to the club sandwich, which is a good bellwether for determining diner quality. If they can't do a club, they're not worth eating.

Well, my club was great. Perfectly formed with the toothpick through the center of each quartered sandwich, piled high with good tomato, lettuce, mayo, bacon and sliced turkey. A large pile of very hot steak fries on the side were an excuse for pouring ketchup onto the plate.

Decent prices - under $10 for a good meal including tip."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot. Can't go wrong with 2 eggs scrambled with cheese, sausage, hash browns, toast, coffee! Lunch and dinner food can be hit or miss, I usually stick to breakfast. This place did seem to go down hill a couple years ago and I quit going for a while. I started going back last year and they seem to be back to normal. Waitresses are friendly, most have been there forever. 

I would disagree with the reviewer who said the place was filthy. I have never seen it like that but maybe late at night it gets that way. The place is old and it's a diner, the same tables and fixtures have been there forever, but that doesn't make it dirty. I am paranoid about cleanliness and this place has never bothered me."}
{"text":"Great breakfast in a pinch. Great salads. 
Decor outdated needs to be redone badly as well as restrooms. 
 Bus people should not sweep or mop when people are eating. Rude and unsanitary. 
 The waitresses are why this place is still running. 
Cannot beat the service they are all like family.
Lorna and all are great servers and people. They knew my mom that's how family orientated they were."}
{"text":"While this isn't the fanciest of places by any means (two hand-written signs on the wall proclaim \"no cigar smoking in restaurant\"), the food is quite decent.  Also be forewarned, this is certainly a local hangout, and as such you won't find niceties such as a hostess (you have to seat yourself) and they don't have a non-smoking section (all tables are smoking).  That's the way that the clientele likes it, and if you can get past those things, the prices are decent, the service quick, if not exactly stellar, and the food hot.

The quality of the food may not exactly be the best, but let's face it - when you're at a 24-hour eatery, you aren't always looking for the best food, are you?  Most times when you stop at a joint like this, you're looking for the fastest service, and as long as it's edible, it will be fine.  This location is no exception to that rule.  The food does quite well in that regard, in fact, and might even exceed your expectations."}
{"text":"The Liberty East is an icon of East Charlotte, which helps it in my book.  The food is nothing spectacular.  I love breakfast so I love the Liberty East.  Love isn't the right word.  I like the Liberty East.  

The prices are something out the days of 50 cent gas and the cigarette machine reminds you that this place was a smokey, greasy spoon at one time.  Today, you can't smoke in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very basic. A breakfast place that has been in the area a long time. I went and the service was ok, nothing special. The environment didn't seem the cleanest. The food was very basic and a little greasy. I would not go back for any reason."}
{"text":"This place has been around Charlotte for more than 40 years. It's \"breakfast served all day\" kind of spot that offers a full diner type menu. I don't come here often, but when I do, it's to chow down on some breakfast. The service is fast & friendly. Don't expect anything fancy but you will get some food that hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Best fried pork chop I've ever had. Solid huge lunch requiring a doggy bag each time for under $10."}
{"text":"It's great. Fast and good services. If you don't eat pork they have turkey bacon and sausage. 

Basic breakfast. Eggs. Grits. Or hush Browns. 
I go there and say FFFFF Waffle House."}
