{"text":"If you can find the place... Avoid it.

It's a tiny hole in the wall of a bar; which is acceptable, considering I live in Chicago and tight bars are our specialty.  I went with friends to see our friend Lola perform in her drag show of the evening.  It was fun enough as money and props flew around the bar's open floor 'stage' area.

Had it not been for the somewhat under attentive bartenders and the overwhelming amount of cigarette smoke I would have had myself a fantastic time.

Not being a smoker and living in a city where smoking is prohibited in bar and within 15 feet of a public building; I must say... It made me appreciate the Chicago law even more so.  If I were management; I'd figure out how to give your smokers appropriate areas to enjoy their death sticks, away from those of us who'd rather not die as a result of their desire to do so.

If you're looking for a good night out, somewhere you can let loose and enjoy yourself... You may want to venture somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's never really busy in here, or I've never really been in on a busy night.  It's a smoking bar. There are sometimes drag shows, the drinks are decently priced (especially considering it's downtown). I can't say too much about it that is negative, but it's not a mind blowing experience either."}
{"text":"One word to describe it, Meh.

I've only managed to stomach this place a handful of times.  I'm not sure if it's the placement of the bar right inside the door that causes me to dislike it.  Or the congestion caused by the location of the bar right inside the door.  Further back you go the more spacious it gets, but it never seems to be utilized correctly.  

Every time I am there there seems to be something going on which entails that there will always be a cover charge which ranges from $1 for amateur stripper night to $5 for a drag show upstairs.  That's another thing I cannot comprehend about this place, you have two floors of space but if an event is not taking place you only use one floor causing people to be crammed around the bar by the main entrance (yes, I'm still complaining about that). 

Karaoke night here isn't as bad as other local establishments, people can actually sing.  Drinks are reasonable priced.  Bartenders are attentive.  That is if you can make to the bar for a drink.  

One bad drawback about this place is that every once in a while you have a random person roaming around asking if you want to buy drugs off them.  Crack is whack."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worse gay bars in the Pittsburgh area.  Bartenders lack customer service skills, they are so bad, Tabatha Coffey would have a field day.  I stepped up to the bar and asked if I could start a tab and the bartender said that the credit card machine was not working.  I said ok I'll go get cash.  I come back and noticed that there were 8 cards sitting on the back counter.  I asked the other bartender if the machine was working he said he didn't have an issue.   Well, I guess you are going to lie to your customers then. 

After I got some cash at an ATM, I returned back to the bar where I waited 5 minutes to be served.  The young bartender said he'd would be with me in a few.   In a few meant that he had to close out tabs that I basically was denied.  He takes my order and then proceeds to have a conversation with another person.  Seriously?!"}
{"text":"Poor beer selection but the cocktail waiter going around with jello shots was a fun touch.  Decent dance floor and DJ.  Unfortunately, we just couldn't get past the awful smoke.  I think we are spoiled in New York where smoking is not allowed in bars or restaurants.  The cigarettes here definitely ruined our experience."}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood bar. Good drinks and great music. Sometimes it can get a bit rowdy but it's always fun. Do call ahead though as there are some nights where they'll have a cover charge of $5 at most. The staff is super friendly and never fails to please. Love coming here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"From what I remember, this place used to be pretty seedy. I stepped in for the first time in probably five years, and it's definitely an improvement. Looks like they've cleaned the place up a bit, painted, and stopped playing porn on the TVs. It was a Wednesday, and well drinks were $1.50, so I couldn't complain. Other than that, there was a $1 cover for only god knows what reason... There were only ten people there. I didn't have cash on me, so the door boy just said don't worry about it."}
{"text":"I came here to meet up with someone back in November 2016. I was in town for haunt tour event. The evening I went, they were offering an amateur strip contest. I don't do clubs or bars all that much. It was never scene. 

I walked here since I parked at a nearby place for the tour. The place is like a basic alleyway between buildings. Nothing fancy, smoking inside is permitted, cash bar, and the place didn't feel all that clean inside. I think the smoke did it for me since I'm not a smoker. I saw the drag show and their performance was meh. Nothing great at all. I heard this place was great in the past, but is now a dump. 

I wouldn't come back here and I do not recommend coming here. Try to find another bar to go to if that is what you are looking for. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"There is kinda divey but Diva Divey. Home to some fabulous drag queens abs performances. Small older establishment that could use some updating. It's definitely not a spot one expects to see pretty queens sashaying like nobody's business. With that said I always have a blast THERE...get it? lol lame I know.
Bartenders are cool and cocktails stiff."}
