{"text":"Let's keep something in mind. This place is a wood burning over pizza specialty shop! Yes it's a restaurant! But the pizza is not to be compared with the classic Montreal \"Greek\" made pizzas!  Apples and oranges. Pizza is delicious and super thin.... eat a whole pie by yourself.  Home made pastas and sausage with rapini on the menu also.  Best wood burning over pizza in the area so far!"}
{"text":"Not too many places with an authentic wood-burning pizza oven.  Their pizzas are tasty with a good choice of toppings and a thin crust but are a little on the pricey side.  Also, muscle car aficionados and collectors typically hold an informal get-together on Monday evenings during the summer. It was a big hit last year, but not as many people show up nowadays."}
{"text":"Originally the pizza was good but then the owner or the manager decided to use cheap ingredients like bad pepperoni this place will not last food is more than ordinary"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Town!!!!  One of the nicest wood oven I ever seen .  Pizza was great, exactly like you can attend from a traditional Italian wood pizza oven"}
