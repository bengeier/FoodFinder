{"text":"HUB is my favourite go-to sushi place.  The setting is small and quaint, the servers are pleasant yet need to brush up on their skills, the sushi chefs smile and greet you warmly....and the sushi is wonderful.  The presentation is lovely and the lobster roll is fabulous!  The price for the quality of sushi is excellent value - Thornhill's little sushi gem."}
{"text":"UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT... place an order for a medium sushi/sashimi party tray to arrive and find out that the order was missed... they left 3 people who worked overtime on a Thursday night starved and hungry. To add insult to injury, they shrugged it off noting that they didn't receive the order when I have a call record on my phone... totally unacceptable! here's the best part... THEY WERENT EVEN BUSY :((((("}
{"text":"TL;DR - Great set dinner meals and fresh, high quality fish.  Good assortment for sushi/sashimi and large rolls.  Highly recommended if you don't have to wait and/or make reservations (and are uptown).  ---  Not the biggest sushi restaurant in the area, but definitely popular in its own right, Hub Sushi has been on my to-go list for a while now.  I stopped by on a Friday night at 7pm with reservations for a table of 3 and not only was it decently full, but I found parking right away! There is a parking lot (although not huge) dedicated just for the stores and condos in the area. The inside of the restaurant is quite modern, very cozy and seats a bit over 30 people I believe.    A lot of people have already mentioned, but there's set courses on the place mat for dinner time and that's exactly what my group and I ordered.  I looked at the menu briefly and besides the set courses, I can't say that the a la carte menu is terribly worth the price.  They're decently priced items (rolls, sushi and hot food) but the set courses are probably the best bang for your buck.   Our order: As we were a group of 3, I asked if I could make the \"Special Dinner for Two\" to three people and the waitress/chef happily obliged! So in case you were wondering, yes - you can do that!  Soup & Salad - Very standard.  Salad was overdressed and that's about it. Tempura - Came with an assortment of vegetables and 1 shrimp + 2 veges each person.  HOT tempura sauce is a plus! Sashimi - There were 3 pieces of each sashimi for all of us but the sushi pieces only came with 2 each.  Luckily we're not HUGE eaters and we had problems finishing what was there already.  Fish was fresh and longer, flatter pieces than your typical fat piece.  Great assortment (with tuna, Hamachi, eel, etc.) and display. Sushi - We got TWO rolls because we missed out on a piece of sushi for the third person.  We got one classic roll and one special roll (the House roll #2 and Kamakaze roll respectively).  Large rolls (hard to pick up) and lots of rice but still delicious.  Seafood Udon -Not a lot of seafood for a \"seafood\" udon but decent sized considering how full we were. Mochi Ice Cream - Got both the green tea and mango and it was alright. Tastes like the ones you buy frozen at the grocery store.  In total, we spent $23 per person before tax and tip for the entire special dinner.  It was a decent price for the amount of food we got (which was a lot) and we were stuffed at the end.  I would definitely come back to try their other rolls but still stick to their dinner courses since I can probably get something around $16-20 myself and still be satisfied.  All the other \"stuff\" outside the sushi and sashimi weren't outstanding, but they were standard and just compliment the meal rather than being the star.  If I had to wait, I probably wouldn't bother but if you get a seat for early dinner or make resos, then why not?  I wouldn't make the trip purposely uptown to eat here, but out of all the neighbouring a la carte options, this is preferred."}
{"text":"friendly staff. trendy deco inside. spacey parking avail. sushi seemed a bit warm & felt a bit soggy. to me, freshness of sushi is most important than type of sauce used on top of sushi rolls. ikura roes on \"ocean dream\" rolls were also missing and they used mini roes. different than what was stated on the menu... disappointing."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Hub and the service and food was excellent.   They are not an AYCE place and the food quality is so much better. It is very reasonably priced for the quantity of food.   Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Newly opened restaurant. The food quality is good. The service was also excellent. I would suggest going for a crunchy roll as that is what they seem to be popular about. I would definitely be back to try another special roll."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was really good. Definitely would come back.  We had the sashimi platter, the spider roll and the volcano roll.  Everything was fresh and the quality was excellent"}
{"text":"came again and while I still think the fish quality and selection in the combo is good I think it's worth noting when a sushi place cannot make proper nigiri sushi that holds together.  It's really hard to enjoy the meal when the sushi is falling apart... I'll still come back but I'll probably stick to the chirashi next time."}
{"text":"We ordered the Hub special dinner for two. The portion was perfect for two of us. Especially the udon was separated into two bowl which easier for us to share it. Everything was great except the miso soup is just a bit watery."}
{"text":"Amazing little cozy place:) very tasty food with amazing presentation and great service to go with it;) what more can you ask for;) 10/10"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Discovered it 3 months ago. Food quality and presentation are above level. And the price is very decent. It became my bi weekly must go restaurant."}
{"text":"Unacceptable longest wait ever for food in my life.   We sat down and ordered food right away, soup and salad came in 5 minutes. But the following main entrees I had waited for more than 40 minutes, are you serious?   I will not return again !"}
{"text":"This is me and my fiancé's favourite go-to, in Toronto/Thornhill/Richmond Hill area. It's the best there is for quality, attention to detail and price point. Not to mention, the Hub Tower is our favourite and we always each order one each. Then, I usually order the unagi kimchi donburi too, which is at a really good price and taste. Love this place! Love their sushi arrangement. Totally recommend you to check it out."}
{"text":"I discovered this place a few months ago and I absolutely love it. I've been here several times since and I've brought a few different friends who have all had the same reaction. The quality of food is great! The rolls are delicious and unique in my opinion. Presentation is beautiful and service is very friendly! The restaurant is not very big so it can get busy."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite spot for sushi. Despite the 45+ minute drive, this is the only place I eat sushi at anymore. The service is always kind and the value and quality in food is amazing.  Personal favourite menu items (in order): 1. Pressed kimchi and eel roll 2. Rainbow Star roll 3. LobStar roll"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden jewel. The place is tiny. The quality of sushi is amazing. They have such a big selection of fancy rolls. The price is around 12$ for 8 piece rolls where somewhere else they charge $16 for this type and quality. Have been there twice and will go again. The service is great too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place! Food is great and service is friendly! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Try and find this well kept secret. You'll be glad you did. The food is beautifully presented, like works of art and delicious too. The service was great, the ambience warm and cosy. I had their Tataki salmon salad and assured myself that I would order it again on my next visit!! Pure heaven."}
{"text":"The bento boxes really good. Flavour is good and fresh!  Enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Went to Hub Sushi because it's right by my boyfriend's place - literally a 2 minute walk from his house. We decided to check it out since driving conditions were predicted to be awful. We got there around 630 and there were already a couple tables occupied. We sat and were promptly given tea and menus.   We ordered off the paper place mat - B) 15 pieces of sashimi, and C) 13 pieces of sushi (or something like that). Each meal comes with salad and miso soup, which were good! We also ordered a Hot Love roll, which has scallops and prawns on top. The roll looked great, and would have tasted amazing if they had added......something extra. It was a bit too flavourless for my liking. But it was still good. I don't think I've ever had a roll like that elsewhere. The sashimi was 50/50 - some were great (melt in your mouth) while some were so so. Same with the sushi (since sushi is basically just sashimi on rice..).   This place is worth checking out. It's a small space, and tables started filling up around 7 so it's probably a good idea to either come a bit early, or call and make reservations."}
{"text":"I tried the place for the first time after hearing good things about this newly opened place from my friend who used to run a Japanese restaurant.  They were accommodating to to our group of 5 adults and 2 little ones.  The restaurant was clean and there are plenty of parking spaces.  Followed by tasty salad, food that we ordered came out pretty quickly as we ordered just before another large group of 10 people.  We ordered 60 piece sushi combo, Unagi don, assorted tempura, and a couple of special rolls.  In terms of taste, I got too busy enjoying the food and forgot to take pictures except for the very first platter of sushi that came out.  Enough said."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on the weekend. One of the best quality Sushi I've ever had. Food was generously served and the service was really good. All staff were very friendly and enjoyable to interact with.  We will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Second time coming here this week. The sushi is pretty fresh and the rolls are unique, with very good presentation compared to some of the other sushi places we go to. Service is good, although they can get a little slow when it's busy. The dinner combos are decent value with a good amount of variety - pick your own classic or special roll etc.   Would recommend."}
{"text":"Their Roll are huge and creative , one of my favourite sushi place , uni are always fresh and large portion .  Dinner special for 2 is good enough for 4 ppls ."}
{"text":"This little Korean owned establishment, sits a little past Yonge & Clark. Apparently they own another joint in Vancouver and decided to bring that goodness here. We have been wanting to try Hub sushi since the summer after a friends recommendation. The price is decent, pretty good. Quality is really fresh and the special roles are melt in your mouth goodness. The Hot Love was specially delicious. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We just passed by this restaurant and we decided to try it. I am so happy we did, the sushi was fresh and testy , the service was very friendly and the restaurant is so pleasant.  They opened 9 months ago and I wish them all the best"}
{"text":"My go to sushi joint. I'm never disappointed with the food. I once had a sliver of aluminium in my plate and when I pointed it out to the server, she swiftly took the plate back to the kitchen and got me a replacement which was even more than what was originally in the order, and my meal was almost half eaten to begin with. She was professional and even apologised which i appreciated and didn't expect. I was very impressed with that experience and it only served to reinforce my high opinion of the place."}
{"text":"Restaurant is small and cozy.  We ordered assorted sushimi, Lobster King roll, Tempura,  Don Katsu. They are pretty good!"}
{"text":"really nice? We came here many times?really love the BBQ sushi. The service is also very comfortable? Strongly recommended?"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious! The point it loses one star is the service. You need to be very patient to wait for them to notice your needs and long waking time for the food"}
{"text":"Sushi are very good in both quality and portion. Many different kinds of sushi choices, definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Hub sushi is now under new ownership and the quality and service has really gone downhill.   When I called in for take out, the attitude was very dismissive and she kept telling me to \"give her one second\", probably like ten times. When I asked to order the sashimi and sushi combo that came with 2 special rolls, she said I did not have a choice on what rolls I want. In the past, I had always ordered Island and Hot Love rolls, and now they are forcing you to get Washington Roll and another roll I have no interest in.   The quality of their platters are significantly lower - I used to get more premium quality sashimi (ie. actual tuna, instead of white tuna) and the presentation now reflects the carelessness of this new management. Some sashimi were not thawed properly and cut roughly in chunks.   Life is too short to have bad sushi? I'd say bring back the previous owners who knew what they were doing.."}
{"text":"I love the pressed sushi. Very good price comparing to Miku. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"The food is well decorated and tastes as good as it looks. The atmosphere is nice (I would recomend it for a special night out). The staff is friendly but it took forever for them to take our order. Don't go starving."}
{"text":"Unique and delish fusion sushi. Quite big size (compared to typical sushi). Ordered lobster roll, and toronto aburi. Good prize for the giant size. However, lobster roll is too big. It`s hard to eat them in one bite. It was quite messy since we had to eat it in 2 bites (per roll). Why 3 stars? Because it`s good, but not best. It`s nice to try variety of unique fusion sushi."}
{"text":"I use to come this Japanese restaurant but my visit today will probably be my last.  The portions have reduced significantly and I was quite disappointed of the price increase and now they give you only a classic roll eg cucumber roll or California roll.  Our waitress wasn't friendly and service is horrible.  The chairs are very uncomfortable and the table behind us kept banging into our chairs due to their limited space.  Will never return."}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch for two. Good portion and the Sashimi is really fresh. Will def come back!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite sushi joints. They put alot of love and quality into their sushi! A must try."}
{"text":"It was pretty good but nothing to rave about or hype up to my friends.   Their raw fish is pretty fresh. We ordered 4 different rolls which were pretty good, but nothing particularly imaginative or innovative. The flavours were all very similar and lacked any fresh inspiration, or a much needed kick. Many of the specialty rolls are very similar, often having the crispy bits, fried yam, and/or mayo based sauce on top.   Cute restaurant ambiance and good service. Also appreciate the Yelp deals!   If you make it here, it's a decent meal, but if you don't, I wouldn't say your missing our hugely."}
{"text":"Bucket list: To try every single fusion roll they have because they have an entire booklet!  The sushi here is very flavourful, fresh, and the staple - comes in big pieces. My boyfriend and I got the dinner for two and it came with a variety of different \"entrees\" for around $48 (not including taxes and tips) With the dinner for two, you get a set variety of sushi and sashimi, your choice of a special roll, udon, tempura, and dessert (MOCHI BALLZ. MY FAV - flavours: green tea, mango, or black sesame)  For the special roll we got the rainbow roll and it tasted amazing!   My friends got the dinner for one and to be honest, some of theirs did not look as if it would be filling. (Maybe 5-6 pieces of sushi) So if you're looking to fill your appetite I suggest you get other rolls to compliment your dinner, since prices are quite reasonable!   The only part that lacked is the speed of the service. It was understandable that it was busy when we went, however the waitress was a little slow on taking orders and it took too much of our time waiting for the food. Despite this, I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Three of us ate dinner here last night, and even with drinks and tip, the bill came only to about $73!  Delicious mango & avocado salad, edamame and three gorgeous rolls, and a few glasses of wine and a beer. Beautifully presented and generous portion sizes.  Attentive service. Well-appointed interior.  We will come back when we visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"came in for a weekday lunch pricing seemed about average. the presentation is unique but i like it and the staff is very friendly and helpful i will be back"}
{"text":"If you want good press sushi and rolls* Hub is the place with good price and just mid town* my bf and i love Jabistro's pressed sushi but the price and location comparison~ i think i would go for Hub instead*  Their fry eggplant is also veryyy yummy* i find the sashimi just average though*  Service is friendly* GO*~ try it*"}
{"text":"Found this little gem by accident looking for    some sushi in the area. I love blow torch (aburi) sushi and there are very few places in Toronto which can do it well. Hub sushi does amazing job preparing Aburi sushi. I did not see some kinds I like in the menu ( e.g. blow torch salmon nigiri or scallop nigiri) however they prepared it for me and did great job. Regular sushi and sashimi were also very fresh and tender. I visited Japan many times so I know how good sushi should taste like, Hub sushi certainly know how to make it properly. I was also impressed with customer service - when they made a mistake in the pickup order which I discovered only at home - they offered to deliver proper part of the order directly to my home, delivered very promptly  and added some extra pieces and soups, while apologizing many times for the mistake. Do they deserve solid 5 stars in my view and I will come back again. One note - they are somewhat more expensive then similar places around them, and another note - their dynamite roll is somewhat big so it is not easy to eat using chopsticks, however this is a minor issue in my view."}
{"text":"Best sushi / rolls outside of downtown TO! Tastes fresh and complex every bite.   I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Rolls were ok, nothing special. Sashimi wasn't fresh, quality that could be found at any AYCE sushi restaurant in North York.  What really brought down the rating was the service. It took 3 waitresses to bring us water. We asked about the yelp checkin discount of 20% off a roll and we all showed our phones that we were checking in. They said the offer was available.  When we got our bills, which were all seperate, they inform us then that it is 20% for ONE roll for the WHOLE table. This makes no sense ?? Especially if we stated we were paying seperately and they looked at all our phones. K."}
{"text":"Food is yummy and service is good at HUB. The Spicy Sashimi Don is my go to meal. The sushi is the right size, cut not too thin or thick. It's our regular sushi restaurant. Try it."}
{"text":"Delicious food and the most professional service! The edamame and dynamite roll were especially delicious, and the fish was super fresh. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and it is really consistent and tasty every time!  We usually get their dinner E combo with comes with sashimi sushi and a classic roll. The sushi and sashimi are always fresh! So good!!!  Their pressed sushi is so delicious and well made. This is definitely a modern fusion sushi place that pays attention to quality.   With $2 more, you can get tempura on the side of which the batter is just perfect. Super light.   Highly recommend. This place has become a neighbourhood regular for me!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Thornhill hands down. Been coming consistently for about a year now and have never had a bad experience. Fish is always fresh, service is always attentive, and presentation is nice. The lunch and dinner specials are the best value since it is not all you can eat. I've stopped eating sushi elsewhere because it never tastes as good as Hub."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about hub sushi - specifically from my health conscious friends that they substitute brown rice for $1 on their rolls - and it STILL tastes delicious! WHAAAAT! So prior to a friend's wedding, a diet ensued and thus, we had a valid reason to actually want to substitute brown rice instead of eating white.   The staff at Hub were friendly, it wasn't too busy when we went but we also went during an off hour. We ordered a number of rolls and substituted brown rice for all of them. We ordered three of the smaller rolls: spicy salmon ($6+$1); spicy tuna ($7+$1) & california ($5+$1); we also ordered a pressed sushi (fried kimchi; unagi & fish egg - $10+$1). The three smaller rolls - 6 pcs each, with the $1 substitution - definitely not worth it, nor was the taste anything too special. It was fresh sushi, it tasted good and it tasted good with the substitution of the brown rice but it also didn't stand out and wasn't worth the price after the substitution.  However, the pressed sushi was the WINNNNER here! It was slightly more crumbly with the brown rice in it, but it was like a mouthgasm the first bite we took. (Although don't hype yourself up!) Their flavours combined together very nicely, with the healthier alternative, nothing was taken away from the combo!   'Tis the press sushi that brought us back again!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and delicious!!  Price is very reasonable, especially their lunch and dinner specials and their party trays.  It is located in a plaza on yonge and clark and it isn't hard to find a parking spot.  They have great selection of sushi, sashimi, rolls, teriyaki and etc..  I usually enjoy their torched rolls like island roll and lobster roll.  You  might want to make reservations during peak hours on weekends since they are usually   very busy.  They are closed between 3:30 and 4:30 for prep times to give you heads up"}
{"text":"I've been here more than a handful of times now - it started out with just spotting the sign and recognizing the name from a friend's Instagram post, and the rest is history. Korean-style sushi conveniently located on Yonge Street, this is a small shop that won't disappoint! Décor is a bit here and there, but nothing's shabby. They excel in presentation - their sashimi, sushi, and rolls are served on wooden boards of various shapes and sizes and laid out artistically, lots of photo opportunities! Their signature playing features HUB branded into their wooden platters - perfect hipster product placement.  The menu covers everything you're looking for - appetizers, donburi, udon and noodles in soup, sushi, sashimi, rolls...all the basics of grabbing Japanese for your meal. There's a bunch of lunch and dinner sets that're great value - definitely a great option if you're considering a mix of sashimi, sushi, and rolls. The lunch/dinner for two is a sizeable portion that's sure to satisfy - hot and cold, fried and raw, even dessert included (for dinner)!  My favourites include their house classic rolls and their chicken katsu donburi, but there's much on the menu that taste great. Probably the best part is the hard-working staff (you'll need to be patient, but you can tell they're really trying!) and the consistent quality of everything. Reasonably priced, conveniently located, a go-to anytime for me."}
{"text":"Amazing place. The sushi is all high quality and delicious. The presentation of the food is all beautiful. They forget to bring us our sashimi because they had a wedding reception going on, but that made that up to us by giving us 2 free ice-creams. Although pricey, you definitely pay for what you're getting."}
{"text":"This is more like a 3.5 and would've been a 4 as I'll explain below.   So the bf and I decided to visit this restaurant and was seated fairly promptly. However we sat there endlessly waiting for a waiter to pay attention to us and realize that we did not have any menus, cutlery or teas. Then we had to go through the whole ordeal of flagging down waitstaff again to order. Now to be clear the restaurant was moderately busy, but it was quite small and not busy to the point that can justify the neglect we felt at our table.   When we finally got a menu, we ordered one of the sushi boat combos for around $45-$50 which came with a variety of classic rolls and your choice of special rolls. The freedom to choose your special roll is great because you can opt for the pricier ones rather than the lower end ones, with the exception of the lobster king roll which costs an extra $2. We went with the energy roll and lobster roll. Both were great, since I love my saucy specialty fusion rolls, but I probably wouldn't go for the lobster king roll again. Mind you they were fairly generous with the lobster but the texture was kind of tough and the natural flavour of the lobster was covered by sauce anyways.  The classic rolls were also pretty awesome. The spicy tuna and salmon were fairly unique because the spicy sauce wasn't the typical mayo-dominant sauce in typical sushi places. I also reaaallly enjoyed the sweet potato roll which had generous amounts of sweet potato (to the point where I actually thought it was fish when I saw it) and it tasted fantastic.   However, despite the quality of the food I also have to factor in the fact that we waited well above 40 min for our food. Our server actually recognized this without us having to say anything and gave us a free tempura side as a an apology. I thought the waitstaff handled it well which is why I'd give it a 3.5 rather than a 3. If the series of long waits didn't happen to me, I probably would've given it a 4, but something must be said when we arrive at 7 and leave at 10,with half that time spent waiting on something. However, I do hope to return and possibly have a review update!"}
{"text":"I love the décor, the presentation of the meal and the portion for the lunch meal! I think the price is a bit high for the quality of the food though. Nonetheless this is a great place to take a date to."}
{"text":"Quality of their sushi was great and loved the presentation of all their dishes.  Ordered the agedashi tofu as a starter, as me and my bf love eating this. You can tell it was freshly fried as the skin was crispy and the tofu inside was still hot. The tofu was most likely marinated before hand as it was not bland and was rather savoury. As well,  I liked that their dashi broth for the tofu had a hint of ginger taste for a nice kick.   We almost ordered the dinner set but instead decided to order two separate sets instead as I was I was craving salmon sushi. So naturally I ordered the salmon lover set and the presentation of it was wonderful. The cut and portion of the sashimi was generous and of good quality. Their sushi rolls were made well, and did not fall apart.  It could get loud at times and you may sometimes hear your neighbor's conversations as it is a small restaurant and the tables are placed rather close, but the inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"It's my first time being here with my boyfriend's family. We ordered two orders of sashimi salad and 5 special rolls tonight. We ordered Caterpilla, Ocean Dream, Energy, Hot Love and Spider Roll.  The sauce for the sashimi salad was very light and it matches with the whole salad. The sashimi includes salmon, white tuna, red snapper, and red tuna! Definitely order this to share with people! =)   The rolls are averagely big and would feed around 6 people! It tastes amazing and yummy! Very fresh~   Overall, the environment is really nice and would recommend this place to my friends! Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"02/18/2018 - Got the \"house B\" roll, which comes with shrimp, tuna, scallops and some veg. Got food poisoning. Used to come here all the time thinking it was an expensive, good quality place. If you want to eat decent sushi for $20/30 a person and get a free 2-day detox, by all means this is the perfect place."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and this restaurant is out of this world.  All of the special rolls are amazing!  I never would have thought in a million years that I could purchase sushi rolls that were this phenomenal in Thornhill.  We tried the Crunch, Sunshine, Golden Bridge, Island and Spicy Tuna Roll.  All of them were amazing and they looked like they were good enough for an a la creme de la creme of restaurants.  All of the rolls looked as gorgeous and perfect as the photos posted by the other users.  My favourite rolls were the Sunshine roll and the Golden Bridge Roll.  This is because I absolutely love salmon and Shrimp.  My parents liked the Island and Sunshine rolls the most.  Allover the food was out of this world.  This is definitely my newest and most favourite sushi restaurant.  I'm so glad this restaurant opened in the area.  We also tried the Terriaki Chicken and we all had miso soup.  Everything was done to perfection.  I will definitely be back for more scrumptious sushi.  They're bento boxes look really good as well.  The product you get is far beyond the quality of the other neighbouring restaurants.  I can't wait to go back and try some more rolls.  If you drink lots of tea, ask the waitress to leave the teapot on your table so you can refill it at your leisure."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to get sushi in Thornhill! Delicious food with great presentation and service!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Kimchi Unagi Don and this definitely my favourite dish, I came back for it twice! I decided to upgrade my dinner combo with the tempura, I'd have to say it looked good, but was a bit soft and soggy - not what I expected. The sushi is good. The rolls are decent - I tried the Ocean Dream roll but I was not 100% sold on the cucumber garnishes w/green onion that topped each roll. I had the Lobster roll another time and enjoyed that much much more. I will definitely go back as they have many interesting rolls I'd still like to try!"}
{"text":"Food: 10/10 -- Value: 9/10 -- Service: 10/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 10/10  We visited late on a Thursday and ended up being the last table there. The food was great, the service was great, and the atmosphere was great. It was just an all-round home run to me.   We ordered...  - Special roll + 4 sushi combo (lobster roll being the special roll) [$16] - Sunset roll ($12) - Scallop and stuff. Can't remember what else was in it. - Uni (one order of sashimi $6.99, two orders of sushi $13.98) - 12-piece sushi ($16) - 15-piece sashimi ($18)  If you check in on Facebook or something, you get 20% off one roll.  For three people, this was wayyyyyyyy too much food and we should've known, but we were also hungry when we ordered and wanted to try everything. Everything I had was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. Except for the uni, because I don't like uni at all, but at least I could admit the presentation was very nice. The rolls were some of the best rolls I've ever had.   The service was exceptional. Super friendly and quick. At one point without us asking, they raised the brightness of the lights at our table because they saw us taking pictures of the food. It was funny and slightly embarrassing.  On a final and peculiar note, I love when restaurants have mouthwash in the washroom. When I saw it, I knew I was going to like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Waited sooooooo long for our food! Don't come hungry! We did come during peak hours, but being a relatively small restaurant with at least three sushi chefs, I really think they need to streamline these sushi making.   So we ordered the BBQ combo which consists of the sunset roll, Fantasia roll, island roll and lobster King roll. And a salmon sushi pizza and an udon. So I think from the time we ordered til we got any food it was about 45 mins. I was thinking maybe we will get the sushi pizza sooner, nope. Or maybe the udon since it's not made by the sushi chefs because that must be what's holding up the line, nope. Of course the rolls did come even later and by that time we were starving.   The sushi pizza was much smaller than what I had expected but the presentation was nice. I guess what we had failed to notice when we ordered this BBQ combo was that all the rolls in this combo were drenched in this special sauce plus mayo. Which was kind of sad because we never really got to taste the ingredients in the rolls and they basically all tasted the same. I really don't remember what the menu said at this point perhaps I didn't pay that much attention cause I was hungry. Don't be fooled by the lobster King roll's name because I really didn't find anything \"King\" about it but it had a small piece of lobster in it, deep fried.   Overall I thought the sushi quality was good just don't order the BBQ combo unless you have at least 10 ppl! Also if you come expect to wait long for your food and the place was really small and it was hard to get the attention of our waitresses at any point, to order to get tea etc. Other than that it was okay. I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"Sunset and ocean rolls are my favourite. Tried the roll with tomato. It may sound weird, but turns out to be very refreshing. We've been here more than 5 times in the last couple of years and we were never disappointed."}
{"text":"Really like going to Hub for the dinner set for two. You get so much food and the quality is good too. My friend and I got the Boston role and really liked that. Overall would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi combination  , creative presentation and great service . Highly recommended visiting this place . Will definitely coming on back here"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill since I last visited a few years ago. From the reviews, it's clear that the quality has deteriorated. Firstly, the sushi rice was soggy and flavourless. The ingredients also didn't seem so fresh. I'd say the quality is what you would find from a below average ayce. Even the tea tasted like it was diluted and had no flavour. The salad was surprisingly wilted too. I'm not sure what kind of dressing flavour that was, but all I could really taste was oil. It is really disappointing at how this place went from being pretty good when it first opened to what it is now."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered tuna holic roll and the salmon aburi sushi. Both were very tasty. The price is very good and can't complain."}
{"text":"The food is superb. Our favourite sushi restaurant in the city.  Nice and clean environment.  The service is great too."}
{"text":"Huh sushi is a decent place to go. Their prices are reasonable and their \"Lobster King roll\" is to die for. I also quite enjoyed their scallop sushi (ordered a la carte). The atmosphere is very modern and the setting was quite dim for dinner.  The reason for a lower rating is because the chirashi sushi in rice had quite a few bones still in the sashimi!!! Attention to fish preparation makes all the difference when it comes to sushi and sashimi. I might've let it pass, had it been only one piece that had bones in it, but I had at least two pieces of sashimi (out of 7) with bones!   I would recommend only getting the Lobster King Roll and Scallop Sushi."}
{"text":"First time at Hub Sushi. I highly recommend their Energy Sushi and Chicken Teriyaki. My daughter had calamari and she liked it toom  Staff very friendly, fast service. Elegant decor."}
{"text":"Hub Sushi is one of my favorite sushi restaurants. Definitely the highest quality sushi I've had and the service is amazing. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and the atmosphere is amazing!"}
{"text":"I selected the Island Roll.  This included shrimp tempura, scallop, yam, avocado, and cucumber.  This was part of the BBQ category of their special rolls.  I really wanted a sushi roll with scallop that day but I found that there actually wasn't too much scallop in my roll.  I think that the yam overshadowed the delicate scallop taste.  However, I really liked the spicy mayo sauce that was drizzled on top of it and for the most part, this was a delicious roll.  Clarissa ordered the Washington (Red Dragon) Roll from the Raw category.  Hers included shrimp tempura, salmon, avocado, cucumber, and tobiko.  This was a roll that wasn't as loaded with ingredients as my roll but it was still really delicious.  I might have even preferred this one more since the flavours of each ingredient really shone without too much other things overshadowing the taste."}
{"text":"Overall I liked this restaurant.  I enjoyed the sushi, it tasted fresh. Was given some types of premium sushi that would usually not be served in a basic sushi set. Service was good, their attention to details were noticible and the restaurant was very clean.  Just a couple of areas to improve on: -miso soup and udon broth were bland -our sushi platter (from dinner for two) didn't have the fish variety we wanted. Half was basically salmon."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Sunday night and really enjoyed it! They have a photo book with pictures of their sushi rolls and it all looks soo good.   My boyfriend and I ordered the \"A\" special which is a special roll plus 4 sushi pieces (you can't pick) for $16. You get a miso soup and garden salad with vinaigrette with the special. We chose the Hot Love roll and Energy roll; they were both good but HIGHLY recommend the Hot Love!!   We also ordered the Agedashi Tofu and it was tasty!  Eat it quick because it won't taste good cold and it   gets soggy from the sauce.   Overall the food was really good and fresh. Will definitely come back here soon!"}
{"text":"Nothing particularly special in terms of the menu, but executed well and reasonable prices.  Definitely above average for mainstream sushi"}
{"text":"If you believe \"life is too short for bad sushi\", then you gotta eat here!  --- tl;dr - Everything is pretty to look at and great to eat!  FYI: THIS IS NOT AN AYCE SUSHI RESTAURANT. And sorry, the food was too good to remember to take photos. ---  My wife and I stumbled upon this place after she was scrolling through her Facebook feed and saw many, many, many, mouthwatering pictures posted by one of our mutual friends. We finally made our way here for a small New Year's dinner celebration.  The place is very \"modern chic\" - I'm terrible at describing interior design, so I will keep it at that. You have to see it for yourself, it's very nice.  Upon entering, we were immediately greeted, seated, handed a menu, and had our drink orders taken.  The menu is very clean looking and straight forward. It is not cluttered by over 9000 items of the same thing with one minor variation.  DANGER: There is a small photo album supplied with the menu to make you hungrier. You'll drool over the pictures of their beautifully presented foods.  Our group of five took a while to decide, but our waitress was very patient and attentive. She got everything right, constantly refilled our tea pot, and occasionally checked up on us to make sure everything was ok. It takes a little while for food to be pumped out of the kitchen, but the excellent craftsmanship is well worth the wait.  For those of you actually still reading this, (I congratulate you for making it this far. I am not a skilled writer) I will only comment on one of the many dishes: the chirashi donburri. It was more beautiful than the picture(s) in the album. There were many thick cuts of well seasoned sashimi resting on a flavourful bed of sushi rice. The sashimi was extremely fresh and left a very pleasant and memorable taste in my mouth. I was still thinking about it when I woke up, and I am thinking about it at this very moment (yes, at this very moment).  This place really lives up to its motto. I only have a few minor complaints... This place isn't close enough! I should've ordered a second chirashi donburri. And the tea could be a little stronger (perhaps a better blend of genmaicha?)  Great way to start 2015! This is a must try sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service.  We had soup, salad, salmon teriyaki with avocado and EBi sushi.  We always go there once a month."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place we have had so far! It is so tasty and we dun want to have other sushi anymore. Me and my wife come to here regularly."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place from the get go. We did arrive a bit late, but they happily served our table anyways, and I was pleasantly surprised by the cute interior. There is an artificial tree inside which gives the quaint little place a lot of character. The music was really good, and the sound system was noticeably upgraded as well. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating (I asked for a pot of tea to keep at the table for my sore throat). I was also pleasantly surprised by a 20% off special roll coupon upon checking in (yay!) So I was obviously happy about that too! Once the food came, it was all very fresh, beautifully presented, and most importantly tasted good! We also ordered mochi ice cream and I was so happy to hear they had black sesame flavour, which is my absolute favourite but so hard to come across, and it was only $2.50 as well. Will definitely be back once I have a chance, a great little hidden gem in old Thornhill."}
{"text":"Cute little sushi joint in Vaughan . We were seated immediately as it was a Thursday night not that many people in the restaurant. Has all the 80s jams I used to listen to when I was in elementary school. It's definitely a good quiet place for a date. We sat down for about 15 mins and were given our entrees in no time. Quality of fish is really fresh and the presentation of the food is just amazing!Service is good as well. Definitely will come again!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi spot. We don't have sushi often but when we do, we usually come to the Hub. It's a cute little place and the food served is, as another reviewer wrote, aesthetically appealing. It's a cute casual date spot. They use garnish and decorations which makes the meal look prettier. Too bad I didn't take any photos, sorry! The meal itself is good, and doesn't take long to arrive, of course depending on how busy they are, but they seem to have a sufficient number of staff at all times. Prices are reasonable, not cheap and not super expensive either. I would recommend coming here for a bite if in the area.  Oh and the ice cream is different than anything I've had. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from Hub Sushi a few times now and they are always willing to cater to our dietary needs (no dairy, no meat, no egg, etc). They also never fail to call us when we've accidentally ordered something that isn't vegan. Their sushi is amazingly fresh and their vegan/vegetarian options are pretty damn unique compared to other sushi joints that usually only have Cali rolls or sweet potato rolls for people who don't eat meat. Our favourite is the Rocky Mountain Roll and Agedashi Tofu, but we've never ordered anything that we haven't liked so far. 100% will order from them again."}
{"text":"Sashimi was very fresh. Service was good but food took a bit too long to come out. Would definitely come back to try their special rolls."}
{"text":"I had the chef's selection sashimi and sushi, and the chef's selection sashimi and rice.  I found the fish not too fresh.  There were bones in one kind of fish in both dishes.  Service was so so.  Our server never came back to check on us and never refill the tea.  I don't think I will come back again.  There are a lot of better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with friends. We ordered a legend spider roll and a salmon teriyaki combo. Food was delicous and fresh. My froends ordered the hub special for two. Tons of food for the price of $49. It came with salad, soup, a special roll, tempura, sashumi, sushi, and seafood udon. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"came on a Sunday for lunch at 11:30, the opened right one time, and was seated right away. served hot tea.  their placemats had the lunch specials printed on it. most of the items sounded great with variety of sashimi, sushi, pressed sushi, hot foods. Which is great for people that want to try a little of each thing.  we used the yelp check in offer for 20% off a special roll, and decided on the sunset roll. I wanted a torched roll. and we also got a Hae dup bap lunch special (spicy sashimi Don)  we got 1 salad, and 2 miso soups for our order.  the Hae dup bap was quite a decent size. they use spring mix salad instead of the traditional ice burg lettuce and romaine. it was okay, but didn't have the crunch that lettuce should provide. there was a variety of sashimi cubes, salmon, tuna, tai, white tuna, crab meat, beets, radish, tobiko. it's always a dish I look forward to having.  the sunset roll had beautiful presentation. could clearly see the torched top, spicy mayo drizzle, sweet potato chip. the taste was awesome, just the right hint of Smokeyness from the torched top.  the service was very fast, since we were the only customers, everything came within 5-7 minutes.  for writing a yelp review, you get a free mochi! mochi was black sesame, but definitely doesn't need the chocolate sauce, it covered all the taste  I can see how this place could get crowded and busy. there isn't too many parking spaces, and inside is pretty small. one large party and it could take over most of the restaurant.  definitely would like to come and try the other foods they have!"}
{"text":"This is a nicely decorated, small, quiet Korean-owned Japanese restaurant. Their washroom actually smells pleasant because of all the candles, incense, etc.    Each lunch special meal provides enough food to fill up one person. You can tell the chefs take good care to make the rolls to make them look nice and neat. Efficient service as we were like 1 out of 3 tables on a Saturday lunch.   1. Lunch Special A Your Choice of Special Roll and 2 pc sushi ($14) - we ordered the dream sushi roll which included avocado and cream cheese, which was very filling. This roll is for those who like cheese and don't mind rich taste  2. Lunch special C Chef's selection of 10pc sashimi + Spicy Salmon or Tuna roll ($15) - fairly fresh sashimi + bite sized sushi  3. Lunch Special G Chirashi ($14) - Not bad with good variety of fresh sashimi, they give A LOT of rice  4. Salmon Pressed Sushi $10 - this is done very nicely. Good to share among group.    Tips: You get 20% off on a special roll if you check-in on Yelp, which can be redeemed immediately or on a later date."}
{"text":"Very friendly service! The sushi was amazing. Very fresh and delicious! Cute little place. Very intimate and cozy. I would go here again. Great variety on their menu."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant numerous times and have had positive experiences. Seating is limited but the wait time was generally quick. Waitresses were attentive, filled our tea several times without asking and came to see how we were doing. The food was pretty good, the fish and tempura dishes were very fresh and well presented. The sushi portions are quite large and the prices are fair. This is one of my go places for nearby decent Japanese food."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner at around 8pm on a Saturday for 6 people, we waited for about 20 minutes without a reservation. The have a sushi roll menu with photos and lists the ingredients in each which is helpful. I opted for the sushi (4pc) and roll combo for $16. The sushi itself was good and the fish felt fresh and didn't break apart when you picked it up. The roll I got was ok, the seared scallop on top was good, but it was drenched in mayo, it was very overwhelming and all you taste, a mouthful of mayo.  My friend got just sushi with no roll and it came with a lovely presentation with a glittery tree like decoration, it definitely looked impressive. My other two friends were also not full from their sushi roll combo order and had to order an additional roll, so their portions are too large or don't come too too hungry.   The service was nice, we never felt rushed and we were there for a while chatting. They also play cheesy 2000s pop music there which is a fun casual plus."}
{"text":"Our favourite sushi restaurant, service is great, food is great, price is reasonable, we would recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"A little cute Japanese Restaurant on Yonge Street. My wife very much enjoyed the Unagi Kimchi Donburi and the sushi was fresh. We would come back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places.  All the specialty rolls are pretty good and they have some unique sushi rolls. The press sushi is very yummy and sharashi is very fresh and the rice is near perfect.  Great little place."}
{"text":"Great interesting menu, beautifully executed dishes. Ordered the dinner for two, with \"Island\" special roll and seafood udon. We had to wait a little bit for the sushi/sashimi, but the wait was well worth it! Chefs were crafting non-stop, the restaurant was busy, not a single free table throughout our stay.  All ingredients were fresh, and this is very important for a sushi restaurant.  We will definitely be returning to try more, loved their spin on sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Here is how i would rate this place: The atmosphere: 4.5 Service: 4 Food quality and presentation: 4.5 Price: 4  Overall: 4.5 We ordered a variety of dishes and sushi and everything was good. I specially liked the yams spicy rolls.  I would definitely go there again. We are lucky to have so many great sushi restaurants around us and Hub is one of them.   We had a Yelp coupon for 20% discount on a special roll but they said we couldn't use it even though we did order a special roll."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch at Hub of spicy tuna sushi. Service was quick and friendly, and the sushi was tasty. The green tea was a tad strong, but that is my only issue. We were in a hurry and they took care of us."}
{"text":"The chirashi had a good selection of fish (given the cost) but most of it tasted bland. And because the fish did not thaw properly (most likely), it had a mashy texture; some were even partially frozen still. Knife work needs improvement as well; I had slices with tattered edges whereas others weren't fully cut. This is already my second time at Hub; I doubt I'll come again."}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed this little place once in the past. Unfortunately this time was different and different enough for me to never return again. I ordered a spicy tuna sashimi salad for $13.00 and instead I got non marinated square cuts of miscellaneous tuna, the lettuce and tuna had ZERO sauce on it, and portions were rather skimpy. I didn't order an appetizer with garnish... I ordered a salad. Spicy sashimi is usually tossed in the marinade and the salad portion is tossed in a ponzu sauce and garnished with seaweed and cucumber. I went back to let the restaurant know my order is wrong and the server sweetly just packed me a side of hot sauce.  That was the final straw for this lack luster dish...They were kind enough to refund me my $13.00 I did leave the tip and applicable taxes behind for their troubles. But it's very upsetting when you go to a mom and pop place and are served food with such lack of care. Also, I have seen and ordered this sashimi salad in the past and it was not served in this manner"}
{"text":"Very good service! Great presentation! Most importantly food is fresh! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Hub has only been around for 4 months and I'm glad it's here hence Iriana and I wanted to check this place out. The location is quite central however parking is very limited. Interior wise, Hub is quite beautiful with its Asian-Zen like contemporary decor.  For those who use both Facebook and Yelp, you're at an advantage. Checking in on Yelp entitles you 20% off a special roll, and Facebook entitles you to free tempura! :)  The service is excellent and good thing about this is place is they have a picture menu, which helps a lot(Since im more of a visual type-of-guy). When it came to ordering, we were unsure at first, but thankfully our server provided some recommendations that paid off!   The food works!  Tempura: 3 pieces per order, zuchinni, shrimp, and Yam, all three were freshly fried, not salted with perfect balance of pan-ko! Island and Fantasia both awesome kick@ss dishes, beautifully presented, portion was bang on, but most of all the melody of flavors were satisfying :) I found it a bit interesting how they added cheese to the Sushi but nonetheless it was delish! The size of the Sushi was quite big so don't try to treat it as a one-bite sushi but rather two!    Overall awesome place If you're in the Richmond Hill - Thornhill- Markham area.  Glad that the HUB is here."}
{"text":"We didn't expect the sushi to be so good!  The fish is fresh, the presentation is beautiful and the atmosphere is nice.  We really enjoyed the meal and will definitely be back again.  We had the pressed tuna sushi, the hub tower and the Boston roll.  They tasted as good as they looked! Yum!"}
{"text":"Hub Sushi is a mid-range Japanese restaurant that won't break the bank, though they're not considered a budget resto either.  Their restaurant decor is aesthetically appealing, and their plating clearly has effort put into it. This is a nice place to bring a date.  Their fish quality is pretty good, but still lower than that of Aoyama, Zen, JaBistro, and Le Cafe Michi, and even Wow Sushi.  Speaking of Le Cafe Michi, it appears that their old school photo books with images of their offerings are borrowed at Hub Sushi. You'll see what I mean when you go.  Overall, if a pretty restaurant and plating is important to you, and you don't mind that the food quality isn't top tier, then this is the right Japanese resto for you!"}
{"text":"Me and my family went for dinner on a Saturday evening. It was quite packed and we had to wait 5 minutes for our table.   We got the dinner for two for $46. Which came with two soups, two salads, 2 pieces of shrimp tempura and 4 pieces of vegetable tempura. 2 Seafood udons,1 special roll in which we got the \"hot love\" along with sushi and sashimi platter.   We also added on the pressed eel sushi with green onions, kimchi and some spicy mayo. Race for the pressed sushi was kind of dense. But the overall texture melted in your mouth. Flavours went well together.   As for the seafood udon it was nothing special. It was basic frozen udon noodles that you can buy in a supermarket.  Sashimi and sushi was fresh though period presentation was nice. Tempura was tempura. Nothing stood out. Crispy texture.   Overall nice ambiance for the restaurant. Cozy looking. I would come back again to try more of their special rolls."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this place at first but it exceeded my expectations. I ordered the hub tower appetizer (YUM!) and ocean dream roll. Both were delicious!  It's not the cheapest sushi restaurant but not expensive either. The rolls were anywhere between 13 and 20 per 8pc, which is pretty reasonable. Loved the presentation as well."}
{"text":"Owners changed - food is completely different. The fish smelled bad and the special roll was now being served warm... it was way over-seasoned."}
{"text":"Good and reliable place as for me. I like everything about the service, been there 4 or 5 times and every time everything was nice. Love their food design, that's facsinating. I'm not a fan of taking photos, but I think there's enough photos of other people to confirm that.  I'm not a sushi lover, I like their soups more, they are really tasty. Totally satisfied."}
{"text":"Simply the best! I've been eating sushi for more than 35 years. I've eaten at small boutique sushi restaurants, all you can eat sushi buffet restaurants, and everything in between. However, Hub Sushi wins the grand prize!!! From quick, outstanding and beyond exceptional customer service, to fantastic presentation of food, and superb flavour and quality, this place has won my heart!"}
{"text":"The place is very nice. The food is tasty. The server is very friendly! I would definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  The quality was good.  Came here for lunch and ordered the sashimi combo.  Presentation was beautiful.  Reasonably priced for the quality.  Just wish that there was more as I finished still a little hungry.  Overall very good.  Cozy little restaurant on Yonge uptown.  Convenient location.  Will come back."}
{"text":"The sushi was great and we had other appetizers as well. Super stocked and clean restrooms a bonus.  Cozy and accommodating."}
{"text":"Love love love this sushi place! This may be my new go to sushi place as there used to be a few others I used to go to near my hood, but this location is good enough. I really have to start exploring some new restaurants around here.    Overall, 4.5 stars. Only because of forgotten orders for my fellow vegetarian friend and the fact they added a fish cake in the veggie udon.   My friends and I pretty much hoarded on all the social media deals we can get. This includes -Posting a photo on instagram and tagging it #hubsushi for a free ice cream mochi -Checking in on Yelp for 20% off a roll  If your combo you chose has a \"special roll\" keep in mind if you want the Lobster roll which is originally $14, you'd have to pay $2 more.   When I was reading the tips/reviews on Yelp, I thought we could get free tempura by checking in. However, this was a year ago my friends but the free ice cream mochi was good enough for me!   The cut of the sashimi and filling of the sushi was amazing. I'm always up for trying new food and loved their special rolls.   If you order to dinner set for 2, they'll give you two separate udon bowls, but as for the tempura, just a dim sum holder to share your tempura. They'll give you plates don't worry."}
{"text":"Terrible service ! Waited over 45 min and no food yet. Waiter told us that he made a mistake and will put in the order again. No apology was made. I have been to this restaurant a few times already and it is the first time this happen, maybe they have changed management. Totally unacceptable, Will not come back."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and amazing sushi! Hub special dinner for two is amazing value. We left the restaurant feeling extremely full and satisfied. Must try!"}
{"text":"Very nice plating.......... attentive service.... food?!  hmmm....... sashimi wasn't chilled and they were in room temperature. They have lunch sets ranging from $10 - $15 which include miso soup and salad.  The best dish of the day was, the salad, it was fresh and it was chilled! But I won't go back for the salad : ("}
{"text":"I have been to Hub Sushi on a few occasions. What keeps me coming back is their yummy pressed sushis and tasty rolls. However, service has not been consistent. On our most recent visit the service was the most disappointing. We had to ask for menus and generally the servers were not friendly. We were there on a Friday night and restaurant was packed.  Also heard a few patrons say that they had reservations but still waited for 30 minutes. When we brought up the issues we had with service to the owner, they mentioned that there is some new staff and still under training. We will see how things go on our next visit."}
{"text":"I used to come here every two weeks and today, I noticed: (1) different Waitresses & Chefs (2) Rice quality went bad, not Pearl rice like old days (3) thick tempura coats, no longer served with big shrimps (4) Nigiri were wrapped loosely, rice fell off easily .... basically, the performance (food) significantly dropped.  I suspect this place has been taken over by another owner :("}
{"text":"Came here for lunch special. First of all, price increased but I can't complain. Secondly they got rid of the special roll lunch combo ... Oh well, I got the lunch for one which came with a good variety of everything - sushi, sashimi, torched sushi,  tempura, udon.. You name it! Also came with soup and salad. Now I was full but I don't think you'll be stuffed after this... I like the proportions and they did put effort in the presentation. I think it's pretty good for what you pay but I can't say its amazing... Parking is a bit of a hassle usually because the lot gets crowded quickly so come earlier!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi, not all you can eat but the lunch specials are sure to fill you up. Great ratio of rice to meat. Enjoyed it for the first time will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my GF. Ordered a sashimi lunch specials for two , which was very fresh and tasty. Came with soups and salads   The place is small but cute, service was quick and very accommodating.   Reasonably priced and I would go back I'm sure. This was one in a very few sushi places that has fresh good tasting sushi   Above average"}
{"text":"My first visit was very good. Tried the tempura and sushi and sashimi and soups. All was good. I would be happy to come back again."}
{"text":"3 out of 5 freshness of the fish. Service needs to be improved. Waitress doesn't pay attention. I ordered Toro sushi and got completely different order called \"albacore toro belly\", I find it a bit weird.  Cozy small place. Very nice presentation. Have some interesting variety on the menu. Overall not bad for this area."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars especially for presentation. Everything is served in a pleasant and appealing manner. I came with a friend and ordered the set dinner for 2 people which worked out to $50 so about $25 each. The set dinner comes with soup, salad, shrimp and vegetable tempura, sushi platter, special roll, seafood udon, and mochi ice cream. All in all, everything was tasty and very filling for two. I thought the tempura was cooked perfectly. We got to pick what roll we wanted and we tried the Hot Love roll which wasn't spicy at all. It was quite yummy though. The seafood udon was alright but I didn't really see any seafood. Loved the sesame mochi ice cream. First time trying it and loved it! Sushi here was fresh and presented on a wooden board which was quite charming. Really glad to have this lil spot in my hood!"}
{"text":"Kid free tonight while my kid was at a party, we decided to go to a place our kid would not like. I would have overall rated the place a 3.5, but on the way out my husband went to the washroom and saw boxes of soy sauce and unagi sauce in there. Odd.  The aburi Sushi and special rolls were delicious. Sashimi nice and fresh. Seafood salad one of the best I have seen. It would have been nice to have my tea refilled during the meal but I guess it was too busy.  Family friendly, cute smaller place."}
{"text":"Love this place ever since it first opened! Staffs were friendly; food is fresh; reasonable price! The dinning room is a bit small to accompany large groups."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi. Great combo options at both lunch and dinner time! Small restaurant but cozy space and good service."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here. Service was a bit slow at time but overall the waitress was good. We had ordered the dinner for two and was pleasantly surprised with the quantity of food. The sashimi was fresh and presentation of food was great. There is also a wide selection of rolls which is always a plus. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We keep coming to this place even though we live far. Sushi is so fresh especially the uni. After the sushi dinner, we had to order an extra set of uni sushi. Tried the Toronto pressed Sushi, quite interesting with the tomato and special sauce on top, very refreshing for a hot summer evening. I recommend all sushi lovers to give a try."}
{"text":"First visit here, ordered the salmon pressed sushi and hub lobster roll. Both were worth it, also got free miso! Yum yum."}
{"text":"As far as sushi restaurants go, and fusion restaurants go, this place hits the mark on both fronts.  Food is well presented, and put together very well. Not only does it look great, but it tastes great too. On top of the quality of the food, they have a unique menu with some items I haven't seen at other sushi restaurants, and it's also a plus that they are delicious. Put all these things together for reasonable prices, and you have a winner.  The pressed sushi is a definite try. Never had sushi pressed into blocks like that before, but it was delicious. It made the sushi more cohesive, and makes it next to impossible for the fish to fall off the rice. I preferred the pressed salmon over the tuna because the salmon had a crispy textural element, while the tuna overall was mostly soft.  A lot of the rolls here look fancy, and also pack a lot of ingredients. I tried the Island Roll to start, and I have to say it was pretty delicious. It had tempura shrimp, yam, avocado, and bbq scallop. There was also the same delicious sauce on top that was on the pressed sushi. This roll comes hot though, so if you don't like the idea of hot sushi move on. But I loved it.  I also tried some of the udon soup, and it was very clean and refreshing. The veggies/cabbage in it had a nice bite to it, and still had some integrity.  I would totally return to this restaurant. To be honest, it reminded me of when I went to Vancouver and sushi here was ruined for me because I couldn't get wild salmon anymore. Now that this place makes such tasty well put together rolls, it's going to ruin all the other sushi restaurants for me."}
{"text":"I've been here couple of times and found their food quality pretty decent, despite being slightly expensive.   I tried to order take out today, but the staff was inattentive and didn't even acknowledge my presence. This is despite being fully staffed at the cash, and me being the only person in the queue. When they finally did, they told me to wait and then proceeded to take phone orders after phone orders. After waiting for over 10 minutes to place an order, I decided to leave.  Food is great, but the customer service never was. This is a good restaurant but I don't think it is a great one."}
{"text":"The sushi here is decently priced. Fish here is fresh and really good, but i much prefer their sashimi than sushi. Their special sushi rolls tend to have the same cheese/mayo sauce all over and can overpower any delicate fish.   Also the rolls are tightly packed and never fell apart! They have a good ratio of rice to fish and other ingredients. The wasabi here isn't fresh though, most likely powder. Definitely get the following dishes:  -Salmon/Tuna pressed sushi -Sashimi -Rainbow star + energy special roll.   Don't get the lobster king and island roll as the lobster pieces were tiny, and that cheese mayo sauce was too overpowering,"}
{"text":"Just reached the 1 hour mark of waiting for our order. From the looks of things, we won't be getting anything anytime soon. Maybe a salad or soup to appease our hungry and upset stomachs? Don't bet on it. Afterall,  it took them 30 min to even give us tea."}
{"text":"I used to love going here for the lobster sushi.. However my recent visit.. The waitresses has changed and served our food too quickly all at once when asked to serve each dish one by one as we're finishing up.. The quality of sushi was not fresh.. I had a huge stomach ache. Not returning back.."}
{"text":"This by far my favorite sushi place in Thornhill... Even Toronto. It's always FRESH, TASTY and the portions are very large! The staff are very polite unlike other sushi restaurants I've been too and it's clean!!! The presentation is beautiful because you know what they say... You eat with your eyes first. I've brought many people here and they all walk out saying this is the best sushi place ever!!!"}
{"text":"Hub Sushi never disappoints.  I especially love their unique, special rolls.  The lunch for 2 and dinner for 2 are great value choices.  You will get to try a wide variety of the menu - sushi, sashimi, a special roll, seafood udon, and mochi ice cream (dinner), in addition to their miso soup and salad starters.  The servers are super friendly and professional, always keeping a calm composure amidst a busy crowd at the restaurant."}
{"text":"We waited a while for our sushi (close to 40 mins after ordering!) but even still, I was happy with the experience at Hub Sushi. The waitresses were nice. Our order for some reason took a while... and they gave us some comp appetizers (fried dumplings & soup). We were so hungry and ate it all.   Absolutely loved the special rolls! However, after consuming them all I was wondering if they didn't have mayo on them would I still like them? hmm something to ponder on for next time? Ordered the Black dragon, Island and Sunset. Wanted to order the Salmon sushi pizza but it was sold out for the evening! Bugger! Next time.  Would love to be back but not sure if I would order take out as my hubby noticed they put some of the takeout boxes in the men's washroom....So much for ordering takeout in the future!   20% off one special roll if you check in w/ Yelp! Pretty busy restaurant so come early or come late for a seat."}
{"text":"With a heavy heart, the Hub Sushi I used to know and love is gone. To my discovery from my recent visit, ownership has changed, menu has been slightly updated, prices increased and service has gone downhill.   It took over 10 minutes to get water as our waitress never actually came to our table. We had to constantly flag her down.   Ordering food was also somewhat of a disaster... We ordered when we got our water and our waitress came back 10 minutes later to confirm what our order was... Wait? You didn't put our order in when we initially ordered? Also, she never bothered to take away our menus the entire duration... Table space is pretty limited already lol.   Food wise, it's still ok but not like it used to be. The sashimi/sushi doesn't seem the freshest. I had the Ocean Dream specialty roll which was similar to a California roll topped with salmon, cucumber and tobiko. The salmon was a little slimy and the flavour of the roll just wasn't the same. Portions are also noticeably smaller across the board.   It was pretty disappointing coming back today. I might give this place another chance later on. Maybe it needs some time to ramp back up to the way it used to operate."}
{"text":"Hub sushi is a neighbourhood gem and our favourite spot for sushi. The food is always fresh and delicious. It's small inside so sometimes there is a wait for a table but they are very accommodating and the service is always efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is not taking any reservations from yelp anymore!!!!!!!!!!!! The restaurant won't know if you make any reservations on Yelp!!!!))!) PLUS 9:30 for last call when a restaurant close at 11?!?!"}
{"text":"We just discovered this place and their amazing sushi rolls. Staff are polite and very kind. There might be a line up if you go there on a weekend night, but the food definitely worths the wait. Fish was fresh and delicious. Nice decoration of your plate just adds to the taste. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Their rolls are just pure amazing! I love how they have different spicy sauces when other places usually use spicy mayo. Personally tuna holic was my fave. Their sushi quality also surprised me as well."}
{"text":"A medium-sized cozy Japanese restaurant with a touch of Korean cuisine, I was blown away by their customer service and the food was very good as well. I ordered the Salmon Lover set and it was fresh and delicious. On the side, we had the Unagi Kimchi Roll, which was even better. We waited for quite some time because it was busy and they gave us complimentary gyozas (deep fried dumplings) while we were waiting.   My friend has two young children and the staff were mightily attentive and sweet to come by not just once but three times to console the crying baby. They brought candy, ice cream, wafer crackers, all with a big smile each time. The child was loud and throwing a tantrum but their genuine concern for the child's well-being really impressed me. And thank you to the other patrons of the restaurant who were also understanding.   Overall, I would definitely come back. Thanks for the lovely treatment and food."}
{"text":"Firstly, I want to say this:  I have eaten at Hub Sushi at least a dozen times in the past year alone.  I must have credit card receipts to prove it lying around here.  I have noticed that in the past half year, the quality of their sushi has gone down. It USE to be my go-to sushi joint but something has changed recently.    My most recent experience was tonight.  Out of nowhere, I had a craving for sushi (thanks Instagram feed), and so I ordered their sashimi/sushi combo (15/20 pieces) which came out to about $45 after taxes.  Upon arriving home, I unpacked the take out bag and realized they didn't provide soy sauce.  Fortunately, I have soy sauce at home but come on, sushi take out without soy sauce is like fish and chips without the tartar sauce.  Inexcusable.  Finally, the pieces of tuna they provided were not just fishy.. It was borderline rotten.  Have you ever left a piece of fish in your fridge say past two or three days it's fresh date?  You know that strong smell?  Well yah.. That's what I had AND I was stupid enough to bite into it.  Look, I totally get that I'm not paying for Jiro Ono quality sushi at $45 but I've had experiences of sushi at places like T&T (keep your snickering to yourself :p) and Mac Sushi (end of day sale anyone?) where even they managed to not serve me fish past its due date.    Sorry but that straw broke the camel's back.  I do NOT recommend going there ever again.  It's sad because I've actually recommended so many people to eat here in the past.  No more.  I'm usually pretty easy going about giving places a few chances (which I believe I have done with this restaurant) because I can appreciate that sometimes, we just don't have our best day everyday but my past few experiences here have exposed a serious problem at this place.  TheRealPY gives this place two thumbs down for now.  Happy eatings everyone! TheRealPY"}
{"text":"Very good sushi!!! Awesome food! Sushi was great and dynamite rolls were dynamite! My girlfriend was very please."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Hub sushi. I got the lunch special and I think it was a great deal there was a lot of food and it was delicious and fresh. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Their lunch and dinner combos are both very well done and reasonably priced. Service is generally attentive. They got my order wrong once but were quick to fix it. Most importantly the food quality is great and the plating is always so nice. Almost too pretty to eat! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the sushi has never disappointed! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great little sushi shop, it was full on a Friday night so we waited 15 mins. Service was slow since it was just 2 servers for the whole restaurant (10 tables, 40 ppl roughly). They were really nice but could see their were tired from working non stop.  Menu had photos and descriptions which was very helpful, food arrived quickly just like the photos and was pretty tasty. We had the golden gate, hot love, dynamite and house b roll."}
{"text":"Hub Sushi has always been my go-to sushi place. I love the restaurant and everything about it. From the plating to the quality of food it is all incredible. One thing I really liked about it was the special rolls. They usually come along with a great deal when you go during dinner time. I ordered a special roll - Beef Crunch and I would definitely order it again. The calamari is also very good and it is fresh. The one thing I would have to say about hub sushi is that the fish has an off taste which was a little disappointing. Besides that the service and everything else was well done."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great dinner combos. Thanks Hub! They have many special rolls to choose from and pictures to help you select one.  The ambiance is small and quient."}
{"text":"OMG been a fan for HUB since forever... we've both dined-in and ordered take-out from HUB in the past. However, the last party tray we ordered was absolutely atrocious. The quality was actually worse than grocery store sushi. I had guests over at our place on a weekend... It was definitely embarrassing... we actually had so much left over because we couldn't even put them in our mouths. So I pre-ordered the 75$ party tray in hopes that my guests and myself would enjoy the sushi I ordered. I went to pick up my tray and noticed the tray was a bit small at the time of pick-up... I didn't really put too much thoughts into it so I went home opened up the box and man both my husband and I were like... \"wow... this is from Hub?\"... The size of the nigiri was so small... fish was super thinly sliced... so thin that even the worst AYCE place will give you a thicker piece... All the rolls and nigiri were crammed in the smallest size party tray possible. The maki rolls were falling apart coz they tried to slice them so thin to \"jib\" you into thinking that you get the # of sushi you have ordered. The rice was warm and mushy... it was definitely the worst sushi experience I have had....  I am sorry Hub... you used to be so good for a neighborhood-sushi-spot... I don't think I'll ever come back because the last order was so horrible... I felt my money was truly wasted... and I was very embarrassed with the food in front of my guests... :("}
{"text":"Best sushi rolls in town! We have tried 3 if their different special rolls, and they all tasted amazing! It does have a ton of mayo on the rolls, but I guess that is what makes it taste so good. They used minimal amount of rice compared to the ingredients inside which I really liked.  The service was good, and they even gave us free dish after our meal.  Definitely recommended, and will mostly likely come back!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. Server is very nice. Food was great.  Recommend.    You will probably spend $20 -30 per person here."}
{"text":"We come to this place all the time, and it was super disappointing that when they messed up our order they completely denied it. We had ordered a dynamite roll and instead got a California roll, when we called back to change it, the woman at the phone said that she clearly remembers our order, even though we would never ever order that. So instead of offering us another one, considering we'd have to drive back to get it anyways, she argued with me saying I was wrong. Clearly customer service is not their top priority. It's fine, we won't be coming back, there's like 3 other sushi restaurants on the same block."}
{"text":"No thanks. Will never return.   Ever since the owner has changed, it's gone downhill. I kept giving them chances to prove themselves but it has always been disappointing one way or another.  Again, portion sizes have decreased drastically.   Also, this place is very baby unfriendly. Firstly, does not have a diaper changing table. Secondly, does not like families with babies at all. In different and multiple occasions of our visit, they kept giving us the bill as soon as possible. I still had food on my plate and they gave me the bill, as if they wanted me out the door asap. Not once did I ask for the bill because I simply am not done with my meal. That felt very rude and infuriating. (Note that the newborn baby was not loud or obnoxious, the baby just made a few small sounds here and there. Also note that there was many empty tables available. So there was not a line up waiting for my table to open up and I haven't been seated at my table for a very long time.)  Now this place is not cheap. Our bill came to $55 after tips and tax for 2 people. I came out feeling very dissatisfied by their rude/rushed service and food was just mediocre. I will spend my money and time elsewhere.    Sorry, never again. I miss the previous owner of Hub Sushi."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been craving for Unagi Don, so we looked up North York Area and found this place.  When we booked the table over the phone, the scheduler was not professional at all, needed us to repeat our booking information for three times. That's no problem with that actually, maybe the place is too popular and too loud so that she cannot hear us properly.  So we made the reservation, and they made us to sit in the middle of the restaurant, where the servers keep bumping our chairs because there wasn't enough space. I mean, shouldn't we get a more decent seat?  In addition, there were only 2 servers and they were not efficient at all. All we saw was them running around, pick dishes up one by one back and forth. Even the chefs from the kitchen go to the floor and help out.  The order was chaotic. I heard the table beside us was not happy at all because the order came out all wrong. Food was messy. I mean, it tasted OK, but the presentation could be better.  We ordered the sizzling plate of Unagi Don. There was veggie underneath the pieces of unagi and they are all burnt. It tasted OK, but again the presentation lost its points. My boyfriend ordered the Sashimi combo. They tried to put it up in a fancy way, but again it failed...it just looked weird.  Overall, I wouldn't come again unless there is no alternative. It was a bad experience of service, regardless how good their food are."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, the Hub wasn't on my radar, but my girlfriend and I were happy to have ventured into this Korean-run Japanese restaurant on a Saturday night. Similar to MINE Sushi or Oyaji Sushi, which are some of our favourite uptown joints, the Hub offers a wide selection of quality rolls ranging from your usual suspects like spicy salmon rolls to new unique interpretations like Lobster King roll.  We started with the salmon lover combo, which came with a spicy salmon roll, and an assortment of salmon sushi and sashimi. It was an fair portion of food compared to the behemoth that was the Lobster King Roll. We loved this torched roll, although we originally contemplated against ordering it because it had asparagus and yams.  Trust the reviews and photos, if you like torched rolls with avocado, cucumber and tempura, you'll like it! The over-the-rainbow was also quite delicious and to be honest, we over extended with three dishes since we only had two people. For all the orders, the presentation was nicely arranged on wooden planks.  Overall, the Hub is a casual restaurant meant for gathering together with a few friends. Sure, the service could have more prompt with more attention, but that is easily overlooked if your expectations are simply for the delicious sushi. It's a nice surprise and we'll round up to 4 stars here for value."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Delicious food and service is excellent. Definitely will be back again and again."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Disclaimer: I am not into rolls with a lot of mayo or any dressing. So I have yet to try those \"Special\" rolls at Hub Sushi.  Lunch Special at around $12 is reasonable priced with the quantity of food. Checking in at Facebook scored me a free tempura which was really good.  Sushi Lunch (8 pc of sushi and 3 pc of tuna roll and 3 pc of salmon roll) - The fish selection was good as there was variety  - If they would have the pieces with sauce plated separately, it would be much better - Maki rolls were badly made and the seaweed was really soggy  The complimentary tea was really tasteless like plain boiling water. Maybe they should just taste the tea before serving to customers.  Service was excellent and attentive. My waitress was really nice and has a great smile.  Hub Sushi is great if you are looking for a non traditional sushi restaurant experience. They serves interesting rolls and portions are great.   I will be back to try out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are great! Perfect combinations with sashimi, sushi, rolls, and udon! Obviously they have freshest sushi, quick and wonderful service also :)"}
{"text":"good quality sushi! love it! the pieces are very complicated and unique! each type of sushi has it's own!"}
{"text":"The food here is goddamn delicious. For the showcased dishes, there is no doubt that they got that shit on lock. They focus on their sushi as well as their meat dishes; they're decadent and presented well. For a restaurant hidden on Younge, their aesthetic is a cute attempt but it's a little misplaced and cluttered. All in all, solid but replaceable."}
{"text":"One of my favourite a la carte sushi restaurants to go to! I usually order the same sushi combo, but the presentation has been different every time! The sushi chefs really put effort into the presentation of the sushi, which I love. On top of that, the sushi never disappoints of course! The fish has always been great quality and the sushi has been delicious. As well, the service is always extremely friendly and polite! The seating is a bit limited so I recommend making a reservation if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Went here last week on a Saturday night. Got 20% off a roll when I checked into Yelp. I didn't really get to see a lot of the restaurant when we arrived. It seemed small.  We were placed by a window in a corner booth, seats were not comfortable or roomy.    Took a bit of time  to order but I was glad there was a separate picture book with the names of the dishes on the bottom of each picture (different from the menu).   I ended up ordering the Unagi kimchi donburi  and  a salmon holic roll.   The Unagi Kimchi Donburi reminded me of Bibimbap. But definitely wasn't as flavourful as I expected it to be. One note flavour, but the plating was very nice and appealing. It didn't taste as good as it looked.   The salmon roll was very filling  I only had 3 pieces. Very big, hard to fit the whole thing in your mouth. Ended up packing up the rest.  Thought it was cool they offered pressed sushi. That seemed to be a hit at the table.  One odd thing was that my friend's boyfriend saw some of the sauces stored in bottles in the washroom. I think that's a weird/unsanitary place to put it.     Didn't get to try dessert but they had mochi ice cream. I wish I got to try it.   Overall, I wouldn't be sad if I never went here again. I wasn't amazed by the food but it was decent sushi."}
{"text":"Was dying for Japanese food after a long day at work, came here. Server was attentivr, if you are going for sashimi boat this is not a place for you. But if you were looking for a variety of special roll, they got hella selection, I try not to over order but we got the legend roll combo, it was beautiful like an art. So colorful. Their sashimi selection was just so so. Their fried fish filet was amazing, they have high chairs for baby. Chicken karage was crispy but could have been more interesting."}
{"text":"The salad and soup are delicious and different from the other restaurants, not very salty.  They have some really fancy rolls and the presentation is great!  The rolls are delicious.  The nigiri sushi are somewhat very small compared to other restaurants.  The prices are bit more expensive than other restaurants I've been to but when you see the presentation etc it's understandable."}
{"text":"I decided to give sushi HUB a try with my friends after seeing that it had high reviews and was in my area. Thornhill is usually known for good \"cheap\" sushi and \"all you can eat\" type places... But not known for having the best quality sushi restaurants.   They have a wide selection of sushi to choose, and all of their special rolls sound delicious. If you have a craving for sushi.. Reading the menu can make your mouth water  Service: our waitress was really nice and helped me in choosing my last roll choice, which ended up being really good. This was my first time checking in anywhere, and I felt a little weird about asking about the \"20% off a special roll\" promo for Yelp check in and the \"free order of tempura\" if you check in on facebook. The waitress knew exactly what I was talking about and within seconds I ordered a free tempura dish and got 20% off my special roll (which was only originally $10 to begin with)   I ordered  - miso soup  - tuna roll  - Boston roll (shrimp tempura, spicy salmon, avocado, deep fried fish, green onion) $11 - forget the name (avocado, salmon, yam, crab) $10  The miso soup was delicious. I love miso soup and this one seemed better than other places.   We then got our free order of shrimp tempura. Nothing overly special.. But definitely tasty   Our rolls came, and we were all really impressed with the presentation. The fish looked fresh, the food looked very Instagram worthy, and we were excited to eat. It tasted really good too, each roll giving different flavours. Not too much rice, fresh tasting fish..   In the middle of our meal, our waitress brought over a complimentary \"special roll\"!order (these things are like $11!) and told us it was \"from the chef\". I was so excited because one.. this doesn't happen often, especially in Thornhill, and because it was delicious, and very different from the rolls we ordered previously. That was the icing on the cake to an already great experience.   im extremely picky when it comes to sushi, and this place nailed it. It's about time sone one raised the bar for Thornhill sushi restaurants. If I could improve on one thing I would ask them to make better combinations for ordering. Most places gve options where you can order 3 good rolls, soup and salad for a good price.. But these options were very limited here.   Overall, our first time eating at HUB sushi was a really great experience, and we will definitely be returning. Everyone at our table really enjoyed their sushi.   Your not going to find any place with quality sushi like this North of Sheppard.. So if your in Thornhill and want really good sushi for a very fair price.. HUB sushi is your place"}
{"text":"Went there again today to test out a theory. Yes, the sushi you get on the lunch specials are a little smaller than the ones you get a la carte. This is not a big deal as we think the value here is very very good. I took pictures today if this site will allow me to post them. This has become our favourite sushi place in the GTA."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I love coming here! Is always quick, fresh, good portions and so good! You defiantly pay for what you get!  Parking is not always the greatest but once you get in you're golden!  Tonight I had one of the dinner sushi sets and I am stuffed! For $19 you get soup, salad, 6pc sashimi, 6pc sushi and a roll! I added the tempura because I just can't resist!  Defiantly my favourite sushi place in the area!"}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday evening. Glad I came. It was really good. I always like finding great new places in my neighbourhood.  Location: In thornhill off of yonge and Clarke. On the Vaughan side of thornhill. Just north of the mess that is yonge and steeles.   Parking: Suburbs. So yeah, there's parking. I think they even have some underground parking. It's also close to the Clarke viva stop.   Decor: It's pretty nice. Smaller. Not quite what I would call tiny, but close. Decor wise pretty nice. Dark wood, modern but not to modern. Music, you can hear it, but it doesn't affect your conversation. Weird combo of gangsta rap and Japanese pop.   Seating: Tables and the table booth hybrid.   Food: Loved my meal shared a dinner for two. Tempura, Sushi, sashimi, soup, salad, using, dessert and special roll. We got a lobster roll for a bit extra. Worth it  This not an all you can eat place yet I feel I ate more than I ever had at one. Everything was delicious!  Quality product.   Everything came in pairs except the tempura which was weird. No even Steven.  But liked it, not greasy, nice and crispy. Even the soup and salad I liked.  I preferred their sashimi to the sushi. There wasn't a lot of flavour to the sushi. I think I'm saying it wrong.   Lobster roll was HUGE!! One thing about the rolls, they were wonderfully put together!  They never fell apart like they do in some places! It also was delicious. I'd get it again!!  I'm not the biggest fan of soup using but liked it. The noodles were cut a bit smaller so I didn't end up wearing the broth like I normally do.   Staff: Really nice, great staff. One thing, that was really annoying, very very annoying. Some woman kept coming to our table every 10 minutes to ask if everything was ok. Yes, yes it is, leave us alone   Conclusion: Good food, atmosphere and location. Will be back.  Conclusion: Loved the food"}
{"text":"Probably the best non AYCE in Thornhill.  The sushi is always fresh, beautiful presentation, and the service and polite and attentive.  They have reasonably priced specials for both lunch and dinner.   My favourite is the hot love roll because it contains both tuna and shrimp!"}
