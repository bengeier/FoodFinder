{"text":"This place is AMAZING.   First of all, the people are just so damn friendly. I've only been there 3 times over the last few months, and they still remember me! They're very happy and talkative while working, and on slow nights they'll sit down and just look blissfully proud.   The food is delicious. I've tried their pita/hummus, their gyros, and their sandwiches, and all of it has been great. You can see them cooking while you wait if you peer around the little shutters, and they're often smiling. My boyfriend's body pretty much rejects anything with spices on it, but he loves their food so much that we still eat there because the heinous diarrhea is worth it.  As for the price: it's pretty affordable! I'm a poor college student and can manage it, which is definitely saying something. You can get a stack of pita and lots of hummus for something like $5, and their gyros are similarly priced.  Overall,  I love Munchie's and will always come back. I wish I could support them single-handedly so I could keep them all to myself!"}
{"text":"The chicken shwarma is quite good for the price, tucked into a large soft pita and filled with not greasy and better than average quality chicken. The owner is indeed a real sweetheart. You might want to get it \"to go\" because the seating isn't that great, but it's a good bang for your buck. I'll try the gyros next!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that I can count on to be a great meal every time.  The chicken shwarma  is the best around.  The great food along with great owners...  Ale.  This place is perfect!"}
{"text":"munchies is very good . but a bit pricy .    the owner is great and really funny nice guy .    go support the munchies."}
{"text":"I don't know why Munchies is getting such high remarks, and I feel like Yelp has led me astray with this one.  I love Greek salads, and this was the absolute poorest excuse for a Greek salad I've ever had.  Iceberg lettuce, mushy tomato, mushy green peppers, cucumbers, and onions.  No feta cheese or olives to speak of... and this was a GREEK SALAD!    I'll admit, the pita bread was good, but honestly you guys, if you're looking for Mediterranean food on Mill, please walk like two blocks north and go to Med Fresh Grill instead.  Their Greek salad has never let me down.  (Two stars because the owner was actually really nice, his salad was just awful.)"}
{"text":"First time ever eating/ordering here. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich. Bomb af. I was at work and didn't want to take an early lunch, so I ordered through \"Uber Eats\" got here un 20 mins and was still hot! Bug ups to Munchies!! \"Bookmarked\" !"}
{"text":"Late night food is the only good thing about this place. The owners scare me and gave my order to two drunk girls. I've been here multiple times and they are always out of random menu items. Basically lady resort for late night mill ave food."}
{"text":"Their name says it all in terms of what to expect and for whom they are perfect!  The food is splendidly greasy and mostly delicious;  the perfect stop between bars on Mill Ave.  Their Greek food isn't stellar by any means but the gyros are enormous and the falafel is plenty sufficient.   If you're lucky you'll meet the owner who is an awesome guy.  He'll chat you up and ask you how is the food.  You'll feel good giving him your business."}
{"text":"We walked up and saw that they had daily specials. Great!  Didn't want Saturday's and were going to go next door, but finally decided to go in anyway. As soon as we walked in the man told us we could have any daily special. Perfect! Good thing we stayed.   Gooood food and such nice people! Excellent customer service and a fine price. Place is on the dirty side, but if you just imagine that you're in New York then it kinda adds to the coolness of the experience.  We definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, went late last night after a few rounds at the bars on Mill.  Very nice owner, made us feel welcome even though we were probably tipsy and annoying.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot in Tempe.  Off of Mill, this place is quite possibly the best kept secret!  Don't let the name fool you!   Walk in and you will feel like family.  Eat the food and you'll be craving it until the next time.    I'm a fan of their chicken entrees.  The chicken is so flavorful and tender.  It is a must!  Chicken Swarma...Oh my! Super Tasty! Chicken Philly...will make your taste buds tingle!   Great lunch specials and I hear it is quite the place to be during the late hours of the night. Go there once, and you are guaranteed to be addicted!  I heart The Munchies!"}
{"text":"\"Munchies\" says it all. It appeals to the pallet of inebriated students.  I had a meat lovers salad.  I think the gyro meat was not the kind cut off the rotisserie but the pre-cut kind you can buy at the gorcery store. And the \"shawarma\" was pretty much shredded chicken douced in some kind of Franks Red Hot sauce. Definately not shawarma. The place is dirty. Underneath the beverage cooler and beverage dispenser resembles the entrance to a dark, putrid cave inhabited by tiny zombies.  Fries were good and the pita bread was really good.  Something is just not right about this place in my opinion.  Stick to microwave mac n chesse you crazy kids."}
{"text":"Not sure I would come back here again!  I had gotten my food to go as I had to get back to work.  Before I even got to my car I realized they hadn't closed the to go box and my salad was almost completely dumped into the bag (all over the napkins, all over the silverware).  Very bummed considering I paid almost 10 dollars for it and a drink. I tossed the half of my now plastic bag-salad away and tried to salvage what was left in the box.  I had gotten a chicken salad and the chicken slices were thin and partially burned.  The dressing was piled on super thick.  It was simply a plain ole chicken salad, not worth the price and trouble."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this is drunk food at its finest. Once upon a time in CO Springs I sauntered into a similar locale, discovered the wonder that is gyros, and promptly forgot where I had been the next morning. Years passed and I tried to find a substitute  to no avail. One day I happened into Munchies. Two bites in, I cried. Now I can barely go a few nights out without dragging my friends in so I can get my fix.  The real test was one sober afternoon when the hunger hit. I was in the area and figured I would chance ruining the place for myself by eating un-enhanced. And it was still just shy of transcendental for such reasonable prices.  Good, cheap (for the area) food and the staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Had the chicken schawarma, it was amazing! Definitely will be coming back. I love that it's open late, a midnight meal is always great. There were a lot of drunk people for a Wednesday night but I mean it's mill Ave I would be surprised if there weren't any."}
{"text":"Small family run business. Tried the greek salad and greek fries (fries with feta, garlic, spices) Good quality and fast service. Friendly staff Good for lunch or quick dinner"}
{"text":"This place is......delicious! Good price, quick service, and yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, reasonable prices, very tasty food, great portions. There's nothing not to like about this place. It's a greasy spoon, but that's what you expect. Drunk food at its finest."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 2 years now. The staff is so friendly, they're like family now. They're always genuinely interested in what's going on with you, and that love really transfers to their food. The food can sometimes seem not-so-fresh, but nothing I could ever complain about. I mean, it's called \"Munchies\" for a reason-it's quick, intimate and open late!"}
{"text":"This place makes a solid pita wrap. As a vegan I often crave falafel, and this is one of my fav places in town for it especially with their late hours. Highly recommend for a late night falafel and fries."}
{"text":"Serves the best quality of food for the best price! The owners are an adorable husband and wife team and they are very attentive. The location is great and I would recommend it to anyone! Try the chicken shawarma or the Philly cheesesteak, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Best Mediterranean food around, specials every day. Owners are extremely nice and generous. Recommend the chicken shawarma deal on thursdays! Comes with shawarma, side (fries, half hummus) and a drink for 5.95. What a steal."}
{"text":"Solid late night. Very average Gyro and Fries. Quick service and decent late night option on Mill Ave"}
{"text":"I come down to mill all the time but this was the first time i stumbled into Munchies. The service was excellent. The food was okay, but I didn't order much. Its a definite must if you are down there."}
{"text":"We went to see a concert at ASU, and we parked by the ASU music building. Being fairly old folks, we couldn't just go to any old place. And we wanted something new. We had done some of the campus stuff already, and we were walking, so we limited ourselves to 6th st and south.  We decided to try Munchies, and we didn't know what to expect. My wife for once had a beef item, and I had a chicken item (typically we are reversed on this). The Shwarma that I had was outstanding, and the sauce I could tell was home made. My wife said her sandwich was great too.  We appreciated the fact that the prices were low. And we got just enough food to eat without having to \"take it home\", as we were going to be in a concert afterwards.  I came home and recommended this to my son (who is a full time student at ASU), and he plans to go there as they are open until the wee hours of the morning.  All in all, if you are looking for good greek type food, at very reasonable prices. This is it.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Love this cute hole in the wall place! It's owned by a super sweet couple who make you put a smile on your face the moment you walk in. Chicken shawarma is my all time favorite!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars for serving delicious meats at a good price with a friendly attitude VERY late at night when most restaurants in Tempe are closed. Here's the rest of the story: I ordered a platter with beef gyro and chicken schwarma. It came with the meat and white rice, and was supposed to come with a pita, but they seemed to forget about the pita. I said nothing because there was plenty to eat, but it kind of irked me a bit. I was also disappointed that there were no tomatoes or onions added to the platter and there was no selection of hot sauces, only Sriracha for the tragically hip! Personally I prefer Tabasco on Greek food, but so it goes. You get a small plastic container of tzatziki sauce and have to ask for a second one, but at least they don't try to charge for that.  It is one of those hole in the wall places with a narrow counter and a few tables and a loud TV set that NO ONE is watching. The tables are filthy and the biggest downside to this place is the difficulty of getting a parking spot in this busy center of Tempe nightlife. All that said, where else can you go in Tempe after midnight for good Greek food?! (That's rhetorical!)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place! No matter what you order you will not be disappointed. They have the best falafel in the whole valley and the hummus is to die for! The staff is very friendly and they let you know you are appreciated for your patronage. When you're on Mill Avenue it is a must have experience!"}
{"text":"Pleasant greek food, owned by a nice guy, but you can do a lot better especially in this neighborhood. Walk a block to phoenicia cafe or drive a bit to Haji Baba."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place...... AMAZING!!! Sitting right off of Mill Ave. this is definitely one of my favorite spots to visit for great Greek/Mediterranean food. Nice quite cafe atmosphere and great customer service. What else can you ask for right?!   Please do your self a favor and check this place out! Plus the operating hours are great in case you hit that 2 am hunger.   Pros: - Great food selection - Awesome Shawarma - Great customer service - Nice quite cafe atmosphere - Great hours   Cons: - None from my experiences  Connect with me on Social Snapchat: iamjeffthornton  Twitter: @iamjeffthornton | twitter.com/iamjeffthornton Instagram: @iamjeffthornton | instagram.com/iamjeffthornton Facebook: facebook.com/gojefft Facebook (Like Page): facebook.com/iamjeffthornton"}
{"text":"the chicken pita was fantastic. meat cooked to perfection, all the flavors and veggie portions were balanced well. family run, service is great and very fast."}
{"text":"Drunk and Hungry from Colorado. My friend and I stumbled into this Greek place after a night of drinking, and they didn't disappoint. They recommended the chicken gyro, and it was delicious! We went back the next night, and they gave us a free gyro because they remembered us (probably not the norm)!  The seating in the restaurant is the only bad part, not enough, and uncomfortable. Overall, to satisfy a late night hunger, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"I hate to write this but something happened on March 27, 2015, that changed my opinion of ever going back to Munchies Café again.  First off, the food is very delicious and I came in quite frequently to order food to go.  A few times I was in the Café, I would hear the female owner yelling at customers and being very disrespectful.  I couldn't believe she was the owner and this was the way she treated her customers. My co-workers told me about the owners and the way they treated their customers and they no longer wanted to order food from there, but I still would continue to call in my order and pick up my food.  On March 27th, I went to pick up my order.  While I was paying for my food the female owner said to me \"You aren't going to leave a tip?\"  I thought she was joking and I didn't respond.  She said it again to me and acted perturbed.  I didn't ask for any special instructions for the food I was picking up, so I didn't feel I needed to tip.   I never tip when I am picking up food and not eating at a restaurant.  Her attitude about this speaks loudly to me.  I now have a Tip for this owner and that is  \"I do not wish to do business with owners that do not appreciate their customers!\"  She ruined my ever wanting to order again from this Café.  Patrons beware you may get the same treatment if you don't tip her!"}
{"text":"Had my first munchies meal yesterday, and based on my meal I'll definitely be back.  First off the two people working there at the time were so friendly right when I walked, maybe it's because I work right across the street.  Either way I was greeted by the nicest woman at the counter and an equally nice man in the kitchen.  I ordered the the gyro with a 1/2 order of hummus and pita bread and a drink. This would have been about 8 dollars but since I work across the street they gave me a discount.  The gyro was just out of this world. Great meat, good pita, good tzatziki sauce. The hummus was very average but I wasn't expecting gormet hummus so I wasn't disappointed.  Overall I would definitely give this place a try, especially if you are on a budget. Daily specials are crazy good deals. Entree (different monday-friday), a side (fries, hummus and pita bread or a greek salad) and a drink for 6 bucks! With the gyro being the Wednesday special, you better believe I'll be back on Wednesdays when I'm working."}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch when I am in a hurry, but still in the Mill avenue area. I have been coming here for years ever since my days at ASU. It is open most nights past 2AM but is less busy than the pizza place next door. Shawarma meat much like its Mexican counterpart Al-Pastor is very tender in nature. You can see this when ordering the chicken shawarma or the chicken philly. I do not eat lamb so I cannot comment on that but I've heard it it too is amazing. I like adding Ketchup and Sriracha to my sandwich which gives it a bit of kick. The fries are thick cut steak fries and have a lot of flavor as well. They taste amazing with a side of ranch. This is a great place to start if you haven't tried Mediterranean food yet. The service is amazing and has its charm. The once vice is no bathroom which becomes a problem after a certain hour. But that won't stop me from coming there!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden, I stumbled upon it whilst walking back to my car. This place Gyro's are the bomb, it was fairly priced and the sauce was tasty!"}
{"text":"I went to Munchies couple nights ago.  First, the owners and staff are really friendly and kind. Secondly, The place is located in a cute spot at Mill ave.   I tried chicken shawarma and it tasted simply delicious and the price was absolutely reasonable. I'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Munchies is great for ASU students and others as well. The food is great and comes out pretty quick - I always get the chicken schwarma. I've never had a bad meal there and the owners are the nicest people. The food and service are really five star, I only wish they would invest more on their tables, chairs, and general upkeep/cleanliness. Overall, great food though definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Yummie food we loce this place and will come again you will not be disappointed do go and enjoy a nice meal"}
{"text":"Say Yeah for Munchies!! Great Schwarma, great cheese steaks and fries.  When you just need a quick bite with tantalizing flavors prepared and served by a chef/owner who is totally committed to quality in everything he serves as well as a man whose well thought out opinions the world should pay more attention to, this is your spot.  Prices are well within reach of any student's budget and too low for most everyone else.  Go whenever you are in the Mill Ave. neighborhood at ASU and enjoy."}
{"text":"Best Place Ever!!! The employees are always friendly no matter what time you stop by and the food is always made fresh!  The chicken shwarma here is by far the best one I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Popped in from TX and saw this place on yelp for a great late night bite. We had the gyro and philly and both were great and hit the spot. The taziki sauce was perfect.    The staff was awesome and so excited we came in to try the place out.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago I tried their Grilled Chicken Salad and now I'm hooked.  I work nearby and it's a quick walk over to pick up something to go.  I went again last week and it was just as delicious.  They marinate the chicken for 48 hours then grill it and add spices.  I'm on a diet and love this salad because you can eat it without any dressing, the chicken is so good.  They put a ton of chicken on it and it also comes with a warm pita and a couple of different sauces.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place does not have a bathroom for their customers. I can see why - it is located off of Mill Ave and is open after the bars close. They probably don't want a bunch of drunk college students hooking-up in the bathrooms. I had the chicken shawarma. It was OK - it tasted like lemon-infused buffalo wings which is different than I've had at other places. The lady at the counter was nice. They have reasonable prices and the portions were good. The table was dirty and the overall cleanliness seemed a little below standard."}
{"text":"This place has really great food, and everyone is super friendly which is really nice. I got the Gyro there and it's probably the best I've had in Arizona. Also the baklava is like heaven. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a good lunch that's not too pricey."}
{"text":"they raised their prices by a dollar and half. nothing special for late night greek food."}
{"text":"Big fan of Munchies. Salty, greasy Greek food between 5 - 10 dollars for a meal. Good daily lunch specials. Be careful on your way back from Mill, as the price hike between 6pm and 2am is noticeable the next morning."}
{"text":"Great place, great falafels, nice warm pita, great hummus and decent fries. The tzatziki yogurt sauce served with the falafels is awesome..Decently priced as well..."}
{"text":"Terrible decision to have dinner here. Dry, stale, old pita. The \"breaded buffalo chicken strips\" are chopped, grilled meat with sauce...?? Salad was wilted and soggy. Tzatziki was bland. Overall inedible - what a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"This place can be described in 1 word \"trash\" their were cockroaches all over the place and the food was cold as if they tried to reheat it with a microwave! The server was yelling at customers and was very rude! I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Got the low-carb plate The salad was fresh n crunchy Chicken had an off taste didn't eat  Gyro meat was good  But there was a dark brown crunchy thing I think was supposed to be a beef kefta?  One bite and another nope  I'm glad I like salad"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful schwarma and cheesesteaks at great prices too. Will be coming here again and recommending them to my Mesa and Tempe friends :)"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant. The food is gr8, the decorations aren't nice but who cares"}
{"text":"So I've noticed this restaurant for a while now after passing by it so many times but never had a chance to check it out so I was eager to see what it was all about. I was wandering around Mill Ave with my friends and we were looking for a place around midnight that was still open for food. Overall I'm happy to report that the Greek/Mediterranean food here was better than expected especially with the restaurant being open until the early hours of the morning daily.  The lady (owner?) was extremely nice and patient with us as we were trying to figure out what to order. I ended up getting the Chicken Shawarma Pita which was great and what made it especially good was that the meat was cooked to perfection. It was extremely tasty and adding the Tzatziki sauce was a nice touch.  I would definitely come back here again for late night food on Mill Ave and will recommend my friends to check it out as well if they're in the area. If I do end up trying some of their other offerings I will update this review accordingly."}
{"text":"The food was fresh. The owner was very generous. Loved their fries. They tasted like hash browns in a way. My gyro was filled to the brim with chicken. Great portions. It was great sober so I can only imagine how it is after a drunken night on Mill."}
{"text":"First time ever eating here, got a Gyro Salad for lunch. It's huge, only 6.95 and a great fast meal.   Other stuff looks iffy, so eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most underrated places in Tempe.  I am a vegetarian and I love the falafel.  The family that owns this place is very nice and if you come enough times they will start remembering you and know what you want.  You can substitute fries for hummus and it is delicious.  I have never had falafel as good as this one."}
{"text":"Great nom noms in my tom toms. I got the gyro. It was loaded with meat and very delicious. Not like some places where the meat is dry and lacking in flavor.  One of the best gyros I've had. Added plus, its a small, locally owned business and the owners are quite friendly."}
{"text":"I came here quite a few times when I lived on campus. About a year later, I decided to stop in again. I don't know why I stayed away for so long. The chicken shawarma is amazing and the service is fast and friendly. It's a shame you can hardly see the spot anymore behind that monstrosity of a covered patio that the bar next door built. But it's still there! And it's amazing."}
{"text":"It is really time for another visit to The Munchies. Gotta love a place that fresh preps everything possible, the owner serves up his fare with gusto and makes you want to try everything. The Gyros are served on amazing pitas, not dry... perhaps al dente, with excellent fries on the side. Chicken Schwarma is delicious, dolmades, and hummas cross my table often. Everything I have tried in several visits is worth a repeat. I enjoy introducing friends to my favorite spot in Tempe.  And you can stop by after everything else has closed... until 3 a.m. Really!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Postmates, and one of my 4 items was missing. Postmates will resolve this for me, however I did call Munchies to let them know, and no concern was shown. Disappointed at the lack of concern for customer service. They also did not read any of the instructions notes, like no tomato and with extra feta.  The food:  The chicken is not kabob meat, it's regular dry grilled chicken. The Tzatziki sauce is flavorless. Overall the food didn't taste fresh or flavorful, but from the type of place, it was to be expected."}
{"text":"They served a chicken shawarma with hot sauce!! I have never had this dished served in such a way. They advertise this as a \"taste of Greece\" but they smother in in Franks Red hot sauce! Wouldn't refund or serve me another dish. Won't come back."}
{"text":"IT was after 10, I just had many cheap drinks near by, so the apt name was in play.  I went in and they had me at falafel. Which I got to go. $4.50  It was prepared quickly and I was out the door. I opned up my bag and found to my surprise a small container of Tiziki sauce. I was a bit confused as tahini goes with falafel not Tiziki.   I unwrapped my pita and was greeted by a large falafel ball. I dove in. My first bit was decent the falafel was moist and slightly crisp, The Peta was fresh and the cabbage was nice, however it was dry with out the tahini.   They were open late and it my food came fast and it was decent, not the best by far or worst. I would like to try this with tahini.  They had a combo but who would pay $2.50 more for just fries?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and while I was eating a homeless guy came in asked for water the guy behind counter said yeah no problem then he asked him if he was hungry . Not to many good people left  like that I was amazed how nice the restaurant owner was."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Nothing extraordinary. The chicken shawarma left something to be desired but overall I was fairly happy. For the chicken shawarma they use hot sauce, which I thought was curious but I liked it. I think I would have preferred a different flavor, but I did order it knowing what it would be.   I might be back, so many places to try in that area."}
{"text":"You know, for $6.50, this place is damn good. I got the Wednesday Lunch Special which included a giant gyro, a drink, and a side of hummus. The portion was great for only 6 bucks, and it was delicious. The meat was a tad on the greasy side for me, but other than that, two thumbs up. I will be going back."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best falafel in town! It's affordable, delicious, and just a quaint little place that's a nice escape from the usual bustle of Mill Avenue.  I actually decided to come here for my birthday lunch because it's one of the best restaurants out there!"}
{"text":"Quick service and delicious food, can you really ask for more? Stopped by here between interviews and grabbed some hummus and fresh pita. Delicious and reasonably priced. There isn't much seating, it's more of a 'pickup and eat elsewhere' type of place in my opinion, so just be wary of that. There is, however, beautiful outdoor seating at the park next door."}
{"text":"The first time I was in The Munchies I had no idea what to expect. It must have shown on my face because the guy behind the counter (turned out to be the owner) helped me decide and recommended the gyro. It was simply AMAZING. The pita bread was soft, the meat was so tender, and the tzsatiki sauce that came on the side was fantastic.   I've been in many time since then and everything I've tried thus far was great. The owner always recognizes me and makes me laugh! Highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great food, great and fast service, good people. The prices and the hours makes it very convenient!"}
{"text":"I love me some munchies, their daily specials have sustained me through grad school so far. The owners are super friendly and the food is great. I've been here both during the day and at night, and would highly suggest coming during the day, both the service and food are much better. But all-in-all this is a go-to place for me."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice for lunch and both times it was Wednesday which meant a gyro lunch special. You get a healthy size gyro with fries, a side of tzatziki and a fountain soda for $6.50 with tax. Each weekday is a different special so I will be back to try more dishes at lunch. There is outside seating and several tables indoors. The owners take orders, cook and bring your food out. They seem like nice, hardworking folks. This is a yummy, fast lunch place on Mill that us easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Munchies makes great greek and mediterranean food! Their gyros and chicken kabab pitas are very delicious. The couple that run it are very kind and you can tell they enjoy making food for people. Its no wonder they have been at this little spot on Mill for so long!"}
{"text":"Having been comprehensively disappointed by Munchies neighbor Slices (http://www.yelp.com/biz/slices-pizza-tempe), I was hoping for something a bit different when I walked into The Munchies Cafe. While it didn't blow me a way, and it was certainly different and not half bad.  Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  So it's who knows how early in the morning, you're of questionable sobriety, and you've embarked on a quest to obtain some form of sustenance to get you through an evening of future mistakes before you can sit down in the morning and contemplate where it all went wrong. Congratulations! Fortunately, you will find a bit of reprieve here at The Munchies Cafe. Service is extraordinary, and you'll receive an ear to chat if you want and fast service if you don't. Well done. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Woah wait. What's this? Somewhat authentic looking kebabs? While it's nothing compared to the brilliance that I became accustomed to in Europe and Australia, at least they've got the prices right here at Munchies. I landed this bad boy for under $6:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=UT8nc7yZ1BjkivrYXuSeHw&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg  That's fair, and fair makes me a happy camper. Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Great? Nah, but certainly not bad, and ages better than the pizza you get next door. This was a pretty standard bare bones kebab (appeared to be a hybrid of turkish style and a greek gyro), and I didn't dislike it one bit. Throw some shredded lettuce, banana peppers, chili and garlic yogurt sauce into the mix and you'd be looking at something pretty damn close to authentic! Single Star Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I can't say I would, but this is worth it if you're in the area late-night. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"Late night order last night through Doordash. Completely wrong to the point I thought they were messing with me. Won't order there again."}
{"text":"We stopped in Munchies on Saturday night after a few hours of bar hopping on Mill Avenue. It was nearly 7 pm and we had been drinking for a few hours by that point, so food was critical. Some in the group went next door to Slices and the other members of our party went to Munchies. The menu is mainly Greek, but after four hours of drinking, I opted for a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries. The fries were salty and delicious...I'm a huge french fry fan (it's my main unhealthy food guilty pleasure) and I would love these fries sober or intoxicated. The grilled cheese was on pita bread which was interesting, but seriously can you really mess up grilled cheese?   I presume the gentleman working that evening was the owner and he was awesome. Not only did he not care that the other members of our group brought in their pizza from Slices, but when we were leaving he insisted that we leave our trash on the table and told us he would take care of it. He was very nice to our group and seemed like a very genuine owner that cares about customer service. Plus I presume he is use to dealing with drunk people!  Munchies is probably a 3 normally, but I'm giving it four stars because the owner was so nice, the food served it's purpose, and it's a good option after hitting up the Mill Avenue bars. I foresee future trips to Munchies in my future."}
{"text":"Good late night food.  Its never very crowded but it is hot in there with limited seating. The food is Good the prices are good and the staff is pretty helpful. Just don't forget to tip the older lady at the register, she gets a little grumpy if you don't.  But she's super great with cleaning up after people and delivering the orders so it's worth it to tip her.  Overall I would go back. Great place to get food on mill on a busy day."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I was looking forward to some good Greek food.  The order was incorrect.  I was missing a drink, missng an extra order of tsaziki I paid for and ordered the salad dressing on the side (it wasnt).  I did not have any tsaziki sauce on my gyro. Thank goodness I did get some with the dinner so we could share.  The low carb plate which had 3 kinds of meat --Chicken, beef and lamb.  All 3 meats were very dry and did not taste good.  Grubhub took over 90 minutes to finally deliver my food.  They blamed the restaurant for not calling them to pick until it was after the stated delivery time."}
{"text":"CREEPY STAFF DISGUSTING OILY FOOD!  It was late at night and I was really hungry. So I googled late night food Tempe and read good reviews about this restaurant. I walked in and the workers were sitting on the table, eating and chatting, I waited next to the cashier till finally they stopped checking me out and one of them came to the cashier. He took my order of chicken shawarma and side salad then asked me where I'm from which really bothered me so I asked why he's asking then he didn't reply. I saw him making my salad with his hands moving the peppers around and god knows what he touched before making it, especially that I didn't see him washing his hands. I told him to change my salad and sat on a table, looked to my back and him staring at me through a weird mirror, there were also eye wholes in the wall right behind the cashier. It was just WIERD! The lettuce was old, I couldn't stop thinking about him touching it too so I didn't eat it. The shawarma was nothing close to good I was just hungry otherwise I would throw it away. Never going there."}
{"text":"I study at Brickyard which is ASU's Engineering school just next on Mill Ave. This is the place where I mostly go for lunch. It's cheap and not too heavy on calories unlike the other options for junk food. Unlike other reviews, I never had any bad experiences with the staff. I know one of the staff, she works late night and knows my choices really well."}
{"text":"First, I'll say that this place is owned by a friend of the family. Second, I'll say this. Go. Eat. Enjoy. My favorite is the Gyro, but everything's good."}
{"text":"Truly delicious food and great staff! I will be going again and telling people all about it!"}
{"text":"It is rare for me to give two stars, and I was so disappointed with my food that I had to write a missive on it.  Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food - simple ingredients so not much you can do wrong.  Quite frankly, the worst tasting Chicken Shawarma I have ever tasted.  The chicken meat looked and tasted like it had come preboiled and prepackaged.  Flavorless, and not something I would expect from such an otherwise flavorful dish.  The shredded lettuce likely came from the same vendor McDonalds has, and I don't recall much else except the flavorless echo of a yogurt-based tzaziki.  Falafal is dried up and lack-luster, hummus is dressed up in Israeli fashion with Paprika - but otherwise uninspired.  This place is open late, every night of the week - and definitely caters to a younger un-discerning crowd that is inebriated and needing to fill their bellies with sustenance.  And the price is right at about $7-$8 for a meal with fries.  Come here if you are trying to avoid a bad hangover, but not if you want quality middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Great affordable daily lunch specials.  The food is always good, the location is great and service is quick.  The owners are really friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place, I have been here multiple times and their shawarma is awesome! Most people eating are drunk after 12 but I don't think they understand how good it is! I will keep coming! Hopefully they will get beef shawarma!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service! My friend lost his wallet over the weekend and we called to see if they had possibly found it. When I asked over the phone, the worker stated that we cannot call to ask to if they found the wallet. He (the worker named Ray) then repeated that I shouldn't call again and refused to give the phone to a manager.   As a Greek american, this place leaves me embarrassed to be associated to this establishment."}
{"text":"Good, authentic Greek food for a great price from friendly owners and staff just off of Mill Avenue. The gyros and fries were very delicious, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've ever had! Their Philly Cheese steak is beyond amazing! Although I get it without onions and peppers but that's just me! My boy got the falafel and the gyro sandwhich and they were both very different! Nothing I'd get myself but still good!"}
{"text":"Yummy, tasty, friendly, and reasonably priced. We really enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"The Munchies Cafe is one of my go-to places for lunch. It's cheap (especially if you get the lunch special, which is a gyro, fries and a drink on Wednesday), quick, and the staff is very nice! I think it's usually the owners working when I stop in, and they're very friendly. I love frequenting family-owned and operated restaurants like this, and the food is also really good!"}
{"text":"Perfect for late night munchin ,I had a gyro and my husband had chicken tenders and we both agreed it was decent and we would eat here again."}
{"text":"This place has never let us down! My coworkers and I have ordered food to go a couple of times and it is always SO good! I get the low carb plate or shawarma salad and they're both amazing. The meat is always perfectly cooked and the dressing is delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Whoever own this cafe are true capitalists. Because only true capitalists would take advantage of the hungry and weak-willed and find zero problem with it. That said, I willingly submit myself to this capitalist torture. I mean, who wouldn't with their food?  The gyros (evidently said 'yee-rohs') here are phenomenal. This is, however, said with my very limited experience. I visited here around 1am and the food was spectacular. I feel that I should note, however, that I was not in full control of my senses at the time.  Enjoyed my gyro, I know the guys with me enjoyed theirs. They had a very interesting cucumber sauce to go with their french fries. Loved it here, will be coming back. Hopefully more able to appreciate this place."}
{"text":"Yum!  A little hole-in-the-wall dive that delivers!  Being from Michigan where Mediterranean food is commonplace, I was not expecting much.  Imagine my surprise to be delivered with one of the best chicken schwarma sandwiches I have ever had.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The pita bread was soft, fresh and could be enjoyed all alone.  The Tsatziki sauce was a pleasant surprise, although not needed.  Check out this great little spot when you are in town!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Falafel was undercooked and just a ball of mush in the center. Not appetizing at all. The cheese on the greek fries was really oddly tart. And I don't mean it had a tart flavor like feta, for example. It had an odd aftertaste that was almost sour.  If you want greek food, just do yourself a favor and go to Haji Baba or Princess Market."}
{"text":"Ok, so Marnie M, a friend and fellow Yelper has been trying to get me to try this place out for months!  I finally had her deliver to my desk a chicken swarma with hummus platter which comes with a beverage for about $6.50 ( maybe a buck more if Marnie actually delivers it for you).  I have to say that my next lunch break out of the office will have to be accompanying \"the Dutchess\" to see her second family over at Munchies.  I might actually have to add a final star because what I got back was beautifully seasoned chicken to a melting point on a pita with a side of garlic/yogurt sauce that was better than most tzatziki I've had.  I am hearing that they do a Philly Cheesesteak too that makes Cordeleone's have a run for their money! Wait for my update!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Whether it's a snack while shopping or eating while drinking on mill on the weekend, the whole staff is incredibly nice and patient. Their food is also amazing and always hits the spot while being flavorful and on time. Munchies is OPEN UNTIL 4!!! A must for any student. Love the food, love the staff. HUUGE MUNCHIES GIRL"}
{"text":"Whether you're looking for a quick snack, or a real meal, this place has you covered. It's simple, unassuming, yet the food is excellent. Plus the people there are always friendly."}
{"text":"I think this place is great Inexpensive.  Service is courteous.  Food is delicious.  Right off the beaten path, this could and should be the Greek diner to head to if you want something quick and tasty."}
{"text":"My fellow Yelpers have failed me on this one. Just because a restaurant serves your meal in under 5 minutes and that they are open late, does not earn you a 4 star rating. Being a foodie, I asked the cashier (owners wife) what the most popular/ best dish is. I was recommended the chicken shawarma.   My thoughts after my first 2 bites, SERIOUSLY??? I've never had shawarma before, but to me, it taste like white meat chicken simmered in buffalo wing sauce and rolled up in a pita. As for the shredded lettuce my fellow Yelpers referenced, I can't speak on that accompaniment to my shawarma because they must have run out. Lol  The tziki sauce taste like plain yogurt with chunks of cucumber in it and the hummus had such a heavy hand of garlic to it, I felt like I could scare off Dracula with one breath.   On the bright side, the pita was fresh made and delicious, however if the bread is the best and only delicious part of a meal, there's a problem. I know there are vegetarians, vegans, fruitarians and pescetarians. But who just eats bread?  For this restaurant, good thing there are inebriated college students."}
{"text":"The food at this place was outstanding. Got the Philly cheesesteak sandwich with fries. The meat was so tender and moist, completely lacking any dry or flavorless pieces, and served with onions and peppers.   Munchies was one of the few reasonably-priced places still open when we came by around 10 at night. Yeah, there were the occasional wasted customers wandering in for some grub, but damn it, who can blame them?   It's great food, and we sat there watching \"Superbad\" as we ate."}
{"text":"Shhhh, come closer.  I gotta secret to tell you.  The Munchies Cafe has the best chicken wings I've ever had.  Yes, lightly breaded, full of tender meat, and sauce on the side.  Works for me!  This is a family owned place.  The cook came out a few times to ask how everything was.  The food is largely portioned.  My gyro was over flowing with seasoned chicken right onto my fries.  Yum!  Got the munchies, yet?"}
{"text":"Wanted a gyro and my husband and I found out our regular place was closed. Someone suggested Munchies, and we are so glad they did.   We both had the gyro special (gyro & fries). It was outstanding! The lamb was thinly sliced and seasoned perfectly. The homemade dill sauce was fantastic!  The owners were friendly and welcoming.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best gyro on Mill. The meat is so tender and delicious. I am hooked on the gyro salad and I get  it ever Wednesday."}
{"text":"Good and fresh. That is all I can ask for. I don't get why it is not busier here, but whatever... I don't have to wait in a line.   I got some Mediterranean chicken pita thing, I don't remember the exact name now. It was really good and had the yogurt sauce and some peppers and stuff. Kind of spicy but still good.   I ate at this place at like midnight one night. It does live up to its name and it does provide a satisfying experience. Not the best, but above average. I would come back"}
{"text":"this is a real great Greek place in the heart of Tempe on the asu campus just behind a mountain with easy access to a parking garage within walking distance. its got gyros and fries and basically every item expected to be found on a Greek menu, will worth the try."}
{"text":"This place does have great food,  usually a very nice staff of what I believe to be a husband and wife duo.  However,  please fix your hours,  do not say your opened when your are not,  don't make excuses for poor management/schedule planning!  You could make a better business,  more profit,  if you lost your laziness and put your heart back into the business you originally started!"}
{"text":"Great taste, chicken was actually white meat with no nasty chunks.  Was good, quick and did the job!"}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 stars. I stumbled on this place today because of the cheap lunch special billboard they had outside. Monday's special was a cheese steak with fries and a drink for $5.99 I think. Wasn't expecting much but the sand which was very good. The fries were very average. Typical bar food fries. The service was great and the owner himself was inside sitting down and thanked us for coming. The atmosphere is a bit like a little burger dive but the tables were clean and the price was a nice option to most $10 sandwich shops. I will go back Wednesday as I heard the Gyro is really good."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.. Ordered online for pick up.. & I still had to wait in a long line when I came to pick up. Ordered meat lovers pita w/ fries, hummus, & chicken wings. Hummus had too much lemon, pita tasted funny, the gyro meat also tasted weird.. I don't think it's the rotisserie style.. & the chicken was alright but it's definitely not shawarma..I saw the cook dousing it in hot sauce.. The fries tasted old, as if they were cooked.. Sat out for a while & reheated in a microwave before being put in my box.. My brothers said the chicken wings were really good.."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Tried the Philly Cheesesteak w/ Fries and Gyros with Hummus/Pita. It was soo good and reasonably priced :) Also the lady was really nice. I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma pita was pretty mediocre. The chicken was a little dry and the sauce felt more like a buffalo and didn't really work for me. Not a bad sandwich but not a very authentic chicken shawarma. Pita was good though. Very fast service as well."}
{"text":"Without exception, the BEST gyro I have ever tasted, anywhere! Mine came \"chock-full\" of the most tender, flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth meat stacked and piled so elegantly, it seemed a shame to mess it up by eating it. The Pita was busting at the seams trying to hold all this meat in! My fries were made to perfection. Crispy, (seemed to be double-fried?), lightly salted, fluffy on the inside. More than substantial portions served. Well worth every cent. You definitely get your money's worth here. Plus, the most delightful, charming, friendly service from a husband and wife team who could be your own mom and dad. Loved every minute of it! Probably a good thing I don't live too close, or I would feast on a gyro here every damned day, IT'S THAT GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Again, it is obvious that I love the food here, but I want to point out one of the main attractions:  The Gyro Bread.  It is soooo thick and fluffy!  So, so good.  Any sandwich on this bread is amazing:  Best Chicken Schwarma Best Gyro Best flat bread I have ever had  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I loved this place. The meat lovers pita is genius; gyro meat & chicken shwarma! The gyro was on point and the french fries were fried up just right. The tzatziki could use just a bit of work. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. Super affordable. Overall this place was great. We will be back."}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma. The flavor was ok but the chicken itself was extremely dry. Eating it was a very uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"small hole in the wall quick food for the drunken hordes that creep around mill at night. or a quick bite during the day. i like the falafels here better than at pita pit. service was hospitable. I'll return."}
{"text":"The Gyros are beyond delicious & the customer service is flawless. The woman that took my order was so kind, and brought forks, napkins, condiments, and extra gyro sauce with my order. The best greek food I've found in Arizona."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shwarma salad. After a couple of nights of less than healthy food I wanted some greens with lunch. The salad itself was ok but the chicken was not great. Very dry and flavorless. The only flavor was the overwhelming spices.  I dined in and the place was very busy the whole time I was there. That may contribute to why the order took awhile to come out. But clearly some of their customers had been there before. Maybe they ordered something different.  I agree with the other reviewer who said the place was dirty. The eating surfaces were clean but there was definitely some grime going on."}
{"text":"This place has great vegetarian dishes! I always go here for either lunch or dinner and one of the must haves for a veggie lover is the Veg Burger over here. They are simply the best around Tempe. I have also tried their pita/hummus and falafels. All in all the veg food is pretty good and i am not sure about the non-veg menu. (Since i am a veggie myself :P) The staff is very friendly too :)"}
{"text":"Ordering was fast, nice display of the menu, and food was brought to us. Quiet. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the space and solitude, better than next door when it was crowded. Appetite satisfaction."}
{"text":"I love this place. A huge fan of their food, but their French fries are to die for. They're so amazing. Perfect for day time and after a long night on mill. Great location and they have great weekly specials"}
{"text":"Oh Munchies, I had such high hopes for you. I mean, okay, I didn't expect the best food ever, just something to help with those late night gyro cravings. And honestly? The gyro I got was okay.   In fact, what I had a problem with wasn't the food or the customer service I got, but the mistreatment of one of my fellow customers that left a bad taste in my mouth (hypothetical bad taste, that is. Because. Okay. I was eating a decent gyro. It's hard to truly have a bad taste in that situation).  The other customer came in and from her place in line started demanding they switch out her Philly for a chicken Philly. I will say, I would have totally understood if the guy behind the counter had chosen to refuse to serve her and just kicked her out due to her behavior, but that isn't what he did. Instead, he refused to remake her sandwich for free, despite the fact that the two sandwiches are the same price, and made her pay for a second one because he apparently made a mistake when she placed her original order.  I'm sad to say that, due to counter guy's behavior, I sincerely doubt I'll ever be back. Meh late night food is one thing, but bad customer service definitely outranks late night, post drinking cravings."}
{"text":"Best place to get lunch on Mill Ave. When I worked in Tempe, I ate there 3 or 4 times a week. The daily special includes a sandwich, with your choice of salad, French fries or hummus and a drink for just $6.50 including tax.  And the owners are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet."}
{"text":"Not too thrilling. Im greek there is nothing greek about this place...and dirty as hell. 1 time and only time. I'd rather have a slice from next door instead."}
{"text":"Good authentic food, the portions were excellent for the price. Pitas seemed homemade and very good falafel."}
{"text":"This was the worst food you could have on mill avenue. Not to mention the lady that \"helped\" us was the worst waitress I've ever had on mill avenue. She couldn't have been a ruder person. She cursed us out as we left from the eatery! She was the worst person you could get as a server and I pray to God that no one else has to go through the horrible service we had here. Unfortunately the food was additionally irredeemable. The food sucked, but our waitress sucked even more."}
{"text":"I'm not coming back here. The place was empty and I had to wait 5 min at the counter to place my order. And after that, they missed my order! 4 people who came after me got served. Then I had to tell the guy I haven't received mine yet. Took then about 7 more mins to get my order. I water 25 min for one veggie burger. And the patty was not well done. This is a bad place."}
{"text":"The Munchies is great! The owners are so nice, I look forward to seeing them when I pick up my lunch. I have only had the gyro here, but it's delicious!"}
{"text":"MUNCHIES. IS. DELICIOUS. Everything on the menu is excellent and they are fantastic for late night eats, before - or after- a trip to the bar. The place is pretty small, but the falafel is worth it."}
{"text":"Trying to find a healthy place to grab food from late night can be tough but we stumbled upon this place on Yelp and what a great find! I didn't get a chance to go to the restaurant as hubby went and got the pickup so I am reviewing based solely on the food and not the location or dining experience.   Ordered the chicken shawarma greek salad and it was perfect. Came with lots of really seasoned chicken that didn't taste like most shawarma I've had in the past but I think I actually preferred it! Veggies were fresh and plentiful. The pita bread it came with was also fresh and hit the slot. Everyone else enjoyed their food too.   Will definitely order late night takeout from here again! Great healthier option for late night eaters."}
{"text":"The chicken shwarma was ridiculously good. Restaurant doesn't look like much, but this is a great little spot."}
