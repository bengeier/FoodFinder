{"text":"Ate here a couple of weeks ago, just driving past and the giant pig caught my eye (kinda hard to miss lol....). Took a late lunch, place is rather tired looking, but busy. I asked an elderly couple who were just leaving if it was good, they smiled and said excellent. They were right. Great service, very friendly staff. Took the ribs, onion rings and beans, all good portions, everything was good. If I'm in the area again, I'll be back at Elliots...... :)"}
{"text":"Business lunch with customers. 
Read other reviews before going and agreed with the good and bad. 

Service. Good service. Waitress could be taken as a little stand offish but she knew her job and served us well. 

Food.  Yes a lot of sauce but it was great!  
My ribs were a little dry. Guest had the the chop and said it was excellent. 

I would eat there again if in the area."}
{"text":"Elliott's Back Street Barbeque is a bit of a \"Walking contradiction\". 

One one hand, the food is consistently excellent. Ribs are smoked to perfection and well-flavored. The chicken is always tender and juicy. The pork chops are to die for. Even the ultra-greasy fresh cut fries are delicious. Prices are reasonable and the menu sticks to a simple BBQ / Smokehouse formula that is tried and true. 

On the other hand, at any given point during your dining experience, you get the feeling that your business is not wanted or welcome. The building is old and in need of maintenance. There is a constantly pending notion that the floor may give way or the single window unit air conditioner is on the verge of giving out.

The service is downright dreadful. Never a smile, never a welcoming word. Any questions regarding menu items are met with aggression. My cousin asked \"How big is a half rack of ribs?\" Our server responed with with disgust, \"Exactly how big it says. Half a rack.\" He started explaining to her that he'd never seen a rack of ribs, etc.. He was then interrupted by our server to the tune of \"Well I can't stand here all day. Do you want to order something?\" Mind you we were the only customers in the restaurant, so, be prepared for lackluster to bitter service.

Knowing how good the food is and that customer service is not Elliott's forte, we stuck around for the smokey messy goodness that is Elliott's ribs. And I sure am glad we did.

If quality is your primary concern and you can live with receiving service that makes you feel guilty for stepping foot in the door, Elliott's Back Street BBQ is for you!"}
{"text":"Worst BBQ I ever had from a BBQ restaurant, the sauce is bland, the ribs were over cooked and dry, and the service was horrible. Go to Rowdy BBQ or take a drive to Clems if you want some good BBQ"}
{"text":"Service was great. The waitress was genuinely happy and attentive. Here on a Tuesday night, bout 8 pm. Had pulled pork sandwiche and added a lil Cole slaw to the deal. The bar sang along with both kinds of music, Country AND Western. Hockey on the TV. Pretty good for a Tuesday night... Food was pretty damn good n the beer was cold. Prosit!!!"}
{"text":"For a hole in the wall derelict looking building standing lonely on the 51 next to a bunch of seedy motels, this place is alright. Matter of fact, its the best BBQ I've had since I moved to Pittsburgh.

Service is usually pretty friendly. Always a nice, older waitress with a name like Margie or Kathy. They all have that super-thick Pittsburgh accent and chew gum and call you names like Hun and Sweety. Their shirts usually aren't tucked in and they might sneak in a swear word or two but they're the best waitress you could ask for. Ours last night was just one of those ladies. Super sweet and pissed off at herself that she kept sneaking glimpses of Survivor before she could get home and watch it on DVR.

They had two beers of the month. Blue Moons and Sam Adamses. They were out of the Blue Moons so I had a Sammy and my friend got a Mic Ultra.

The food? The menus decent sized. A handful of apps, some salads and stuff. But this is a BBQ restaurant, you're here for the slow cooked meat, right? They have ribs, chops, sausages and chicken. The backpage has about a dozen sandwiches on them, several of which include more BBQ. They have steaks and seafood, too. Plus some diner classics like the hot roast beef. Finally, and favoritely, they have whole wings, $4.95 for six, which comes to $5/dozen. I love wings.

We usually always get a couple things and share them. They have a combo where you pick three meats, a starch and some cole slaw. Its like $13 and its a good choice. One warning....the wings are not BBQed, they're deep fried. Last night, we got the smoked kielbasa, 2 chops and 3 ribs. It was towards the end of the night and they actually gave us 5 ribs. I love ribs.

Aother warning....ask for your meat dry. For some reason, the cooks like to slather everything down so that its literally dripping sauce. Maybe you could try asking them to lightly sauce it, but we've always just kept it safe and asked for sauce on the side. We also got an order of wings and a side of celery sticks. Yeah...you gotta pay for the celery.

You get plenty of food for what you pay for. The meat is pillow soft with just enough char and smoke to get you going. They have several types of BBQ sauce. I always get their hot and spicy. She always gets their mild sauce. She said the mild just tasted like ketchup, but I disagree. The hot and spicy sauce has a nice kick in it, but its not very hot.

I've never had smoked kielbasa before. It was good but not something I'd try again. The chops are great. Each is probably 5 oz or so. The ribs literally just fell apart by touch. The wings were fried just how I like them...well done and extra crispy. You get a pile of fries and slaw, too. The fries are those delicious Pittsburgh double dippers that fatty foodies like myself just love to death. The cole slaw is simple...just cabbage and mayonnaise. But its quite nice.

All in all, I really like this place. The service is great. I like the food, alot. The sauces could use a little bit of work but everything's always tasty and you get a good bit of food for the price. Until I've found a better BBQ place, this is my spot."}
{"text":"Restaurant is self seating, outdated, but with that local small town feel. Server was friendly, took drink orders quickly. 

Food came within 15 minutes. Ordered the Brisket Sandwich with Fries and a 1/2 rack of St.Louis style ribs. Both served with the sweet and tangy sauce. EXCELLENT! Priced reasonably and both were worth the money. 

They have other items like burgers, steaks, salads, and appetizers, but I would stick with BBQ related items, since it is a BBQ place after all.

I have lived in the South Hills for 31 years, cannot believe I just finally ate here. If you like barbecue I would definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"The steak hoagie is amazing and not that pricey. I would recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"used to be the best around, yet in the last 6 months it have gone down hill. we had lunch 3 weeks ago and took forever to get service and longer to get our food. there were only 5 tables seated.. Saturday night we both ordered Delmonico steak and  mine was the worst steak I've ever had, mostly fat and very tough."}
{"text":"This place has the best food! I always get the half chicken or the lamb special when they have it. It is a great value, good service, and excellent quality!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"So before you yell at me for only rating a 2 let me say this. I am a bbq snob. I have had bbq in so many places and states that I couldn't even count. This being said the main reason this is only a 3 star is the sauce. I am a tomato based sauce girl. I'm not big on vinegar bbq sauces and that's what this place serves up. Also... The membrane on the ribs wasn't removed. For me that is bbq 101. The ribs were dried and just not as tender as I would like. I don't think this is a place I would visit for bbq again mainly because the sauce isn't to my liking."}
{"text":"People that have been going to place for years (me and my family) aren't returning because of the decor (very simple, slightly outdated) we're returning for the always amazing meals that they serve! 

I've never had a bad meal here! My most recent visit this past Saturday did not disappoint. I ordered the prime rib dinner special and it was outstanding. Their fries and homemade dressings are reason enough to go back and I haven't even gotten to the BBQ yet! Their sauce is very tomato based, and unique. It stays fresh and never overtakes the meat! The prices are more that fair for the portions and the wait staff is always nice!"}
{"text":"Elliott's has been a staple in our family for years.  We moved to Indianapolis 13 years ago,  but still make it a point to visit when we return to Pittsburgh,  The food is always delicious and the service is great!"}
{"text":"The ribs and chicken with medium sauce were very good.
The sausage was only fair-it's only flavor came from the sauce.
As others have said the sauce is like tomato paste but it is good.
Hot chili was the best part of the meal"}
{"text":"I travel the country and I hit a lot of great BBQ places.  For being in Pittsburgh, this one is not bad at all.  In fact, it's pretty good.  
The BBQ sauce is a little different than I like, but that's the beauty of all BBQ places, you can make the sauce any way you want.  I prefer the sweet and tangy.  It's like sweet baby ray's with a kick.  Not burn your mouth hot, but just a kick.  
My favorite \"go-to\" item has to be the steak hoagie.  Nice shaved beef on a decent sized roll.  It comes with a generous amount of fresh cut fries.  I think it might be $8-9.  Definitely worth going down for that alone.  
Each day, there are specials.  From Ribs, Chicken and pulled port to Brisket and Steak.  I've tried everything and it all has been really good.  
In a place like Texas or Kansas City, the BBQ would be average.  However, for Pittsburgh, it's pretty good.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Elliott's is a great place for BBQ ribs, chops, dogs, and burgers.  The sauce is simple but addicting.  The food is all slow cooked and top notch meat products from Weiss meats.  It's kind of easy to drive by without seeing it so make yourself a note to try this hidden gem of a BBQ joint."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I have visited over and over and over again.  It's on the way home from one of my regular gigs, and from the first time I stopped in (because of the outrageous PIG stuff that caught my attention from the road on Route 51) I have been in love with the place.

The building doesn't look like much.  The dining room doesn't look like much.  The menu doesn't look like much.  But the FOOD is excellent!  They have excellent specials, and everything I have tried on the menu has been well prepared and quite affordable even to those who are on a meager budget.  I have never had a single complaint about the friendly wait staff (it seems like the same people have worked there FOREVER) and I have never had a single complaint about the food, or the bill that I paid at the end of the meal.  I have been there when the place is packed, and I have been there when there were only a few tables being served.  I have also been there when the daily special was completely sold out because we arrived too late.  I have arrived there with just two of us, and I have arrived there with large groups that had to wait for a table.  But I've NEVER had a complaint.  I always walk out feeling satisfied with my meal and with the price I paid.

I'm not saying that Elliott's is the best barbecue that you'll ever eat.  But I will tell you that the variety of sauces is excellent, and that the meats have always been correctly cooked and tender, with generous portion sizes.  I have enjoyed many a chicken wing there too!  They are the WHOLE WINGS, and the dry seasoned ones are just the way I like them, served with a size of whichever sauce you prefer.  I'd have to say that my favorite sauce is the one that they call \"heavyweight,\" and I get it on everything except the wings.  It's a nice, spicy barbecue that doesn't set your mouth on fire, but has enough robustness to make you come back wanting it again.

The sides are always good.  Excellent cole slaw.  Really good fries.  Good portion sizes.  And beer.  You've got to have beer if you're going to enjoy good barbecue, and although the bar section at Elliott's is tiny, they have beer.  Sometimes they even offer an interesting variety of bottled beers, but the tap selection is the usual stuff, including Yuengling lager, which I happen to like.

The place is obviously old, but it's clean.  I've been there so many times, but never had a dirty dish or glass.  The restrooms are clean.  I have never been offended by the customers or the staff.  Just friendly neighborhood folk enjoying some good barbecue, and watching a ball game on an old-school TV.

I'm going to be driving by there this Saturday night on the way home, and I think I'll stop again."}
{"text":"We were in West Mifflin trying to find a place for dinner. When we saw Elliott's BBQ we were intrigued because we LOVE real barbeque.
We were severely disappointed. The sauce was just tomato puree... no spices or flavors just straight pureed tomatoes, the chicken wasn't smoked as one would assume... it was just reheated rotisserie chicken. No brisket, no lamb (even though a huge sign on the outside of the building said that they had it). Don't even get me started on the ribs. Most of the menu was just average cruddy fried food, the BBQ beef sandwich was just the kind of pulled beef you get pre-sauced from Costco. And the chili was absolutely inedible. Chili was nothing but salt. The fries were fresh cut but really soggy. At least the waitress was kind and took it off the menu since no one could eat more than a bite.
I cannot warn people off this place enough"}
{"text":"I broke my Elliott's cherry today and I will be anxious to return. My buddy and I both got Combo orders and were very impressed. We tried to get our 'local BBQ' guy on the hook for lunch today, but he was incognito or something. So, we took a short drive up 43 and hit this place. 

I had the wings, ribs, and chicken breast platter. My friend had the chops, ribs, and kielbasa platter. We both ordered the medium sauce and also tried samples of the sweet & tangy and hot sauce. All were delicious (if not reminiscent of our BBQ guy), but if I had to choose, I would get the sweet & tangy next time. I like hot, but the s&t had a slightly better flavor.

Both Combo platters came with slaw and fries, each of which were ample and delicious. I highly recommend this place, especially if you like good food and a lot of it."}
{"text":"Nothing special, pretty ordinary food. Disappointed it was not a true BBQ place, menu had a mix of typical American fare. Anyway nice little casual place to grab a quick dinner. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Preface ... I do not like giving bad reviews unless the business has absolutely earned it. Having said that, let me set the mood. You see a BBQ restaurant with a pig in front and ya think ... Might be good. NOT!  This is the worse meal I was ever served. Keep in mind I have eaten field rations prepared by both Army and Navy cooks and some of those meals were horrendous, but still better that what I had today. I ordered the combo, 3 ribs, pork chop, and keilbasa with sweet BBQ. When the plate came there was so much BBQ sauce 3 couldn't even see the meat underneath. Did I order the BBQ sauce soup and not realize it?  Wife had sliced pieces of pork. They were so dry dust flew up when she cut into them. DO NOT go here!  Ever ... Never ever ever go here."}
{"text":"Elliott's leaves me super conflicted.  Like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, different aspects of my experience were like they were with 2 different restaurants.

The Good: I've eaten my weight in BBQ many times over, and Elliott's serves up some of the best ribs and pulled pork I've ever had.  They also have extremely reasonable prices, and ample seating, which is something many quality home made BBQ joints lack.

The Bad: 

WRONG ADDRESS:  It's not easy to find with the address listed on Yelp and their website.  The N Lewis Run Rd address took me and several independently driving friends to a residential neighborhood a half mile away.  If you want to get there, punch in the address of the (also very exquisite) Italian place across the street on Route 51.

Ciccanti Ristorante 
1206 Route 51
Clairton, PA 15025

That works on all the GPS's and Smart Phones and you'll see Elliott's big sign across the street without any problem.

There's virtually nothing healthy on the menu, even the salads are covered in cheese and fries, but that's forgivable and almost expected at a BBQ joint.  The inside is weathered, old, and falling apart, but that's fine, BBQ joints are supposed to be cozy and unpretentious.  The down to earth, sincere atmosphere is what makes soul food, soul food.  Unfortunately, at Elliott's as good as the food was, I was not feeling the love, which really tainted the overall experience for me.

We unnecessarily spent about 20 extra minutes trying to find the place because the address they list online doesn't work on GPS's.  When we tried to give them a heads up about this when we arrived, they dismissed us and said they knew about, but the place had been open for years and the regular's didn't have any trouble finding it.  

While this may be true, the fact that they knew about the problem, and were unapologetic about leading everyone in our party, and any future new customers on a wild goose chase when they could easily update their address or add a warning disappointed me.  

Our waitress was consistently negative, terse, glowering, slow, and unhelpful, even though the place was almost empty and we had a large friendly group ordering plenty of food.  I'd give the food a 5 and the service a 1, so a 3 overall.  As good as the BBQ was, the glaringly nasty service left a bad taste in my mouth.  If I go back again, it will be for takeout, I think Elliott's would be best as a long distance relationship."}
