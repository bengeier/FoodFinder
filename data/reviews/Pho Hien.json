{"text":"Fantastic place for Bun, Pho, and spring rolls. Attentive service and always a friendly smile and hello. We visit Pho Hein as often as we can."}
{"text":"They just opened up an I just happened to see it in a corner n mesa an decided to stop by. They have amazing customer service an treated me with respect even tho I came crawling in with no shoes an puffy eyes on a Sunday Hung over needing some pho to help my hang over. The food is amazing as well!!! Customer service tho really took me back."}
{"text":"Server was not attentive. Waited 15 mins after eating n no check.  No water refills even when I placed my glass at edge of table. Food was decent but service was terrible.  20 mins now ...still waiting for my check. Where's my check. :("}
{"text":"A little hidden gem that I've discovered after Pho Mesa sold the business to them.  The service is absolutely superb.  It has just recently opened and the business is brisk but it will pick up if the words get out.  Slightly more than other places but the owner is willing to explain some of their specialty that were only available on the board (RAW Beef with special seasoning--great with beer).  It is great for unique Vietnamese dishes that you can only find here.  Gourmet all the way"}
