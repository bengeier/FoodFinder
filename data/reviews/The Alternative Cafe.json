{"text":"The drinks and cookies are amazing!  Came in town for a quick visit and when we found this place we had to come back for more!  We enjoyed the mochachinno, rooibos tea almond milk latte and just plain hot chocolate and they were perfection!   The cold drip coffee they make over 12 hours was the best I've had!  We also enjoyed the double chocolate cookie and a gluten free chocolate chip cookie which were both soft and delicious!  Will definitely be coming back as often as possible!  The staff is also very friendly.  Thanks guys!   Will be thinking about this place."}
{"text":"I went in with high expectations...and left thoroughly frustrated and disappointed. We were greeted by wonderful sights and smells. A gentleman took our order and we sat by the window to enjoy the start of our day.  The first warning came when the girl brought my wife's mochaccino, in a paper cup rather than a mug as the gentleman specified. A minor thing, but a start. Our food came a few minutes later, however still no sign of my large latte. We started to eat and my Signature Sandwich was delicious. After eating half of my sandwich I went to inquire about my latte. The girl turned away from me as I approached the counter to address someone who just came in. When I got her attention again  and asked about my latte,  she responded, \"oh yeah\". Several minutes later she brought me a medium latte. I told her that I ordered a large and she said \"oh\", and took it back. She returned a few minutes later with a large.  It was  absolutely the worst latte I ever tasted. It was milk foam with barely any coffee. Great Signature Sandwich,  but service and latte were horrible. There was only 1 other person in the cafe who was already eating...i cannot provide a reason for such bad service.  Highly disappointing."}
{"text":"Great coffee, croissants (better than Le Gourmand even!), and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"For a light but filling late breakfast/brunch, we had the Mayan Sunrise chia pudding, avocado sandwich, tuna sandwich (both on multigrain croissants), and grabbed a Kyoto matcha tea latte to go. Just the bread alone has a great texture without being greasy! We didn't get any coffee this time around, but we could tell that everything is made thoughtfully and honestly.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable; the pastries we sampled were the right amount of sweet; and the space is cozy.  The barista serving us was kind to give us a sample of their coming-soon double shot frappe - all around we were pleased with the taste but we were blown away by its smooth consistency!  Wishing all the best for team at the Alternative Cafe!"}
{"text":"Kind of genius to have a squad of bakers deliver ready-to-bake goods which they can fire up fresh on site. The Alternative guys are not only super kind and lovely but have a lot of stuff on offer for a relatively small space: Mexican delicacies like spiced hot chocolate and bunuelos, oatmeal, breakfast, salmon and eggplant sandwiches, parfaits, gluten free goodies, turmeric lattes, cold brew, kombucha, cold pressed juices, piles of decadent pastries and pounds of locally-roasted Hale coffee. Ironically, the selection of alternative milks is limited, but what they do offer is organic."}
{"text":"Dropped by the Alternative on a gorgeous day and the Iced Americano I ordered was reasonably priced ($3.6 taxes in) and delicious.  Staff ensured the water used was cold rather than the gross straight up pouring hot coffee/hot water on top of espresso into ice cubes practice that you sometimes get at other places.  Request for non-dairy milk was met with friendliness.  I can definitely see how this place would get a bit of flack for pricing practices - their specialty drinks are close to $10 per and their coffees tend to be, on average, $0.5 to $1 more than other independent cafes that I frequent, but for the bright inviting space and a fairly optimal location, it's worth a try to make your own judgments."}
{"text":"I go to Alternative Cafe an unreasonable amount of times a week. Despite the fact that they're conveniently located across the street from my work, I would walk out of my way in a heartbeat.   I'm obsessed with their croissants and their Nitro Cold Brew. Not the cheapest coffee shop around the corner, but definitely worth checking out. Perfect for people looking to have quick meetings as well!   The staff is super friendly, always quick to make conversation, and ready to suggest something new if you're looking.  (Did I mention they have a crazy amount of unique drinks available on the menu?)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! My husband and I have been drooling over photos of their food all week and we finally had the chance to stop off here today. We got a Dulce de Leche Almond Croissant and an Ontario Montmorency Sour Cherry Almond Croissant to share. They were both fantastic!!! They have many different flavours every day and I can't wait to try them all.   We also picked up a couple of sandwiches for lunch. My husband got the smoked salmon (with wasabi cream cheese and dill) and I got the roasted eggplant (with egg and tomato) - both on the multigrain croissant - and they were both great! I really like how they use egg whites, as that is my preference.   The owners (I think?) packaged everything so nicely and service exceeded our expectations. They are so genuinely nice and seem like really good people.   I'm already looking forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are so friendly and pleasant!! It's cute and quaint and all of their drinks come in a cool containers. The ambiance is very whimsical, bright and airy.   The food is very tasty. The coffee is delicious. I'm addicted to the Nitro Cold Brew - worth every penny!   They're also a Ritual restaurant which is awesome. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in at random to grab a bite and get some work done. I couldn't help but feel cheerful in this place-- such a friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Never been to a coffee shop with nicer or more competent staff. My cappuccino was excellent and my salmon sandwich on a pretzel croissant was absolutely delicious. Hit the spot. Oh, and super clean bathrooms as well. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"A seriously nice \"undiscovered\" gem, found just back and right of the Starbucks and then straight on til morning. Mornings as they bake up their rugelach the scent emanating from this place is heavenly."}
{"text":"I stopped by for the first time this morning after walking past many times before. I had to write a review just to say how delicious it was! I got a Nutella almond croissant and an espresso frappe, and they were both incredible. So much yummier than Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe, with an interesting menu. Got a turmeric latte for the first time - not for me, but maybe you might like the strong taste. Friends got the Japanese cold brew that comes from a fancy contraption on the wall, looks cool, coffee tasted great. It's a nice treat kind of place"}
{"text":"I wish there were more places like this around. Beautiful artisan sandwiches made with care and spot on cappuccino. Friendly staff and great menu. I tried the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area. I'm glad I walked in."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going back to my roots and reviewing cafes. Salem, the owner of The Alternative Cafe, invited me to check out his Richmond and Spadina cafe. Lined up against other places like Freshii, Yogatree, and Kupfert & Kim, The Alternative Cafe adds to the selection of health-conscious shops along Richmond Street. Almost a year old, this cafe proudly source all of their products locally. For the working nomad, there is WiFi and a limited number of outlets available in the shop for use.  I got a chance to try one of their upcoming Frappes. The Alternative Cafe will be coming out with 7 types of Frappes, flavours including: Natural Chai, Cream of Earl, and Beetroot. I had the Tumeric Frappe since I was recovering from a cold and I loved it. It was a sweet drink that hit the spot for me. I highly recommend trying out a Frappe once they launch at the end of the month. This is perfect for anyone who already enjoy sweet drinks like Starbucks' Frappuccino (minus all the overwhelming amount of sugar). I quite enjoyed the Pineapple Empanada as well, so I do recommend it if you prefer savoury treats. Their cookies are also delightful and generous in size.  Their menu is always changing as they come up with new drinks and food items to serve. The Alternative Cafe is one of the few cafes (potentially the only one in Toronto??) to serve Japanese cold brew, an ancient style of producing cold brew coffee. It can take anywhere from 11 to 17 hours to make! The owner had to piece together multiple sources in order to perfect the process. They also have Nitro cold brew if you are fan of that process too.  If you are near Chinatown/Queen West area and would like a pick-me-up or a new cafe to get your work done, I definitely recommend The Alternative Cafe as your new go-to spot!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe to try but not a lot of workspace. They have this delicious pineapple empanada though that is definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"As I'm working in the area for a couple months, I've been trying a new coffee shop just about every morning. This cafe is at the top of the list now and will require repeat visits!    Upon entry, the staff behind the counter was attentive and upbeat. The shop was cute and quaint, and the pastries and menu already piqued my interest at first glance.  [Changed] The croissants are what I had. They looked a bit intense for breakfast but they luckily said there was the option to purchase half of one; what a great idea! I opted for the Mango Almond and, immediately upon finishing it, wished I got the whole thing.  I also got a cappucino which has been hit or miss for me downtown, often forcing me to go to starbucks just so I can ensure it's hot and more than like 3 oz. Luckily this place was on point again and the cappucino was tasty and of the desired temperature.   I did not try them but my partner back at home is gluten-free so it caught my eye that they had gluten free cookies and a bread option for their meals.   I'll be back to this place and will be getting the entire damn croissant with a side of guilt.  Edit: I've now been back like 5 times lol. They have a rewards program that's pretty decent. I've tried about 7 different croissants, the pineapple empanada, and their samples which they often put out for testing.  I also love getting the Tuna Salad Sandwich on the Multi Grain Croissant and having it for lunch. The cornichon pickles pair so well with the tuna salad. The avocado sandwich is pretty good, too. Their cookies are by a jewish bakery, there are some mexican panaderia goods, and the croissants are all made in house."}
