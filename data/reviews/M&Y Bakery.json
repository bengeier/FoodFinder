{"text":"The plaza has a nice diverse set of stores, but I can see this plaza getting busy especially during lunch hours for the companies around.

This new bakery has a really nice owner and staff. Their selection of buns is definitely standard to other Chinese bakeries. We had their pineapple buns (regular and with coconut), and they were good! We also had the mille-feuille cake (also known as a Napoleon cake) and it was pretty delicious, would recommend! They have an assorted amounts of cookies and pastries as well. They also do party trays, cakes and custom orders as well, like a wedding cake! 

They also have a few all day menus for breakfast, lunch and specials especially for a quick lunch like their beef brisket in rice vermicelli soup. Their brisket was so delicious. I'd go for seconds! 

I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This bakery is tucked away and soooo underrated. They have the best lunches for $5 and the cheesecake here is unbeatable for $3.50 (taste and value wise). I really wish more people knew about it coz this place has a lot of hidden gems like the cheesecake. I don't even like cheesecake that much but theirs is truly outstanding."}
{"text":"This is a bakery close to my house and they offer all day lunch for $4.75+ taxes which includes a coffee, milk tea or lemon water. I had the curry chicken which comes in a square tinfoil container and it was pretty tasty. I am a huge fan of milk tea and theirs was pretty good, not overly steeped so it was enjoyable. They have about 8 tables for in-bakery dining and offer a decent selection of Chinese style buns and pastries. Service was quite friendly and very efficient, as expected. The front door is right next to the tables so it can get a little chilly (it's Jan at this time of this review) while you eat."}
{"text":"Their cakes and meal combos have an uncanny resemblance with Lucullus Bakery goods!

Tried this place out today, as I noticed that even though they have very few reviews, the reviews are of a higher than average rating, so that piqued my interest.

It is a small nice and clean bakery with few seating. When I came in on a Saturday afternoon around 3PM, I noticed they didn't have much baked goods left so I thought I would order me a meal combo.

Before I even mentioned what I wanted, the lady immediately said they only have one type of food left from their All Day Lunch menu, which is the curry chicken ($5). So we got that, and also I got myself a luncheon meat sandwich from their All Day Breakfast menu ($3.50).

I wasn't even done paying and the curry chicken meal was already prepared and delivered at the table.

Right off the bat, it so reminded me of Lucullus Bakery, and how their pre-packaged boxed meals get sold out pretty quickly. When the curry chicken came, it just confirmed my suspicion that they probably have the same supplier as Lucullus Bakery, as the size of the boxed meal is identical to Lucullus Bakery's.

The luncheon meat with egg sandwich is average. Nothing too special. I guess I could say that about this place in general. It's just an average bakery.

After lunch, I ordered one slice of cheesecake for $2.80 and again, it looks exactly the same as Lucullus's cheesecake from my previous photos I took when I went to their location by the new Cineplex theatre in Markham.  The cheesecake was soft and rich, and really filling. The cake is not light and fluffy. It is not that sweet, but it is really rich and a bit more dense than a japanese cheesecake. It's just okay.

The good thing about this place is the cheap price. But I probably won't go back as there are better choices in the area that prepare fresher food on-site for the same price.

{"text":"Been there a couple times for lunch and am a frequent buyer of their cakes. 
This place is actually pretty good to go to if you're in the area. They have all day lunches that go for $5.00 plus tax and it comes with a drink. Taste-wise, it really isn't bad at all. 
Their cheesecake is really worth trying though, it's under $3 a slice and it's really really good ok. Their buns and stuff are nothing extraordinary but they're alright.

Verdict: try their cheesecake!
If you're ever close to this area, the cheesecake is really worth trying out. They also have a napoleon cake which is also really good but it's a little more pricey. 

That's all."}
{"text":"I frequent this place twice on Sunday's since I tutor at the business building upstairs, the service is great and it's quick for breakfast and their lunches for a cheap price (most around $5 after tax including drinks). 

It's a short wait and sweet deal on food, not much to complain about. Definitely drop by if you're on the go and in the area! Totally worth it!"}
