{"text":"Happy to be seated promptly on a Friday evening.  5 stars to Deb our waitress who was so pleasant, never let our drinks get low, and so quick to answer our questions.

My princess enjoyed her mac n cheese, the fettuccine was creamy, trio was huge, calamari = tasty. Spaghetti, meatballs and pomodoro were divine.

So why not a perfect rating? While we lucked out with Deb, I'm just not sure how others fared with the people helping them. Usually when we walk into or out of a restaurant, staff smile and say hi, say, \"welcome to...\" or acknowledge patrons in some way shape or form. Yesterday, all 4 of us were greeted with blank stares (again, except Deb)."}
{"text":"Tried to eat at the Macaroni Grill on N Stephanie and found a live roach in my salad. I recommend not to eat there. I had the bread and threw that up."}
{"text":"Awesome food! My girl and I were looking for something new. We found The Macaroni  Grille. Every review we looked at was horrible and we were skeptical to come but we figured we'd go. Low and behold it was great, from the walk in the door we felt like royalty our server Jessi was on point not missing a beat. The place to be definitely!!"}
{"text":"Sorry but this one just completely missed the mark. Ordered chicken malanese but there was no lemon flavoring at all. The green salad was completely full of cabbage and very bitter."}
{"text":"The place was nearly empty on a Friday night at 7:30. Waiter was pleasant. Ordered lasagna and make your own pasta. Took much longer than expected for it to be delivered. One mail was missing a side dish that had been ordered.  Food was just OK.....nothing special. With 2 glasses of wine the tab was $50 which was high for the quality of the meals. Hadn't eaten here for several years and based on this meal we won't go back."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location for the pas

t 6 years. Although, the food is great there are a select few servers that are good. The bar  area is what is lacking service. For example, if the bartender is serving people, the younger manager should be helping out instead of flipping through the sports channels on tv. In addition, we went there another time this past week and the dirty dishes were sitting on the tables for the hour we were there. When a couple walked in, the younger manager apologized to them and said the dirty dishes were there because everyone just left and because it was so busy which was not the case. We walked out on two other occasions because no one at the bar served us."}
{"text":"My husband received a gift card from one of his clients and we had never been here before.  We had been wanting to try it for awhile so we went there for dinner last night with no kids.  We got there around 5pm and for a Friday night we did not have to wait to be seated so we must have gotten there before the dinner rush.  The greeter was friendly and so was our server.

My husband loved the bread they give you before your meal with the olive oil & balsamic vinegar and I must say it was delicious.  We did the 2 for $9 appetizers - fried macaroni and the baked prosciutto & mozzarella - both were delicious but the baked prosciutto was our favorite..we could have just ordered a couple of more of those and be done..lol.  

For the entree, I ordered a new item. It was 3 cheese ravioli with butternut squash & pine nuts..  Oh man the raviolis were huge and the sauce, pine nuts and squash on the top was SOOO good.  It was a big order so I was only able to eat 1/2 after eating the bread and appetizers.  My husband ordered the Mama's Trio which included chicken parmesan, lasagna bolognese, chicken & mushroom cannelloni.  the servings on his plate looked like he had 3 entree's ...this was a huge portion so we probably could have shared this between the 2 of us.  My husband said everything was delicious as well.  

As for the restaurant itself, I really liked the ambiance of the place.  I would definately NOT take our kids here.  Seems more like a place to go with your date. And since its Christmas time right now looked there were a lot of maybe office gatherings.  We saw people coming in carrying gift bags.  I dont recall seeing any kids there last night either.  And a couple of times the hostesses came out and sang a couple of Christmas carols and WOW they sang awesome...so I really liked that.  When they werent singing they had Christmas music playing.  

For us, we really liked Macaroni Grill and will definately go back.  Next time we would like to go sit in the bar area and just order appetizers and a couple of drinks...I think that would be a great time."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Macaroni Grill since living in AZ so I was more than thrilled when my family decided to get together and go! My first impression when we walked in was that the ambience was beautiful and for a saturday night it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. The ambience was immediately ruined once we walked in and an expeditor in a mint green shirt who I witnessed yell \"don't touch me!\" to a server who tapped him on the shoulder who clearly had a question concerning an order. What an asshole! Our server Taylor was a sweetheart and gave us great service:) My family ordered the Mediterranean sea bass, the shrimp portofino and the pan-roasted pork chops. It was all amazing! I also recommend the goat stuffed peppadew peppers they are delicious. Ps: their balsamic reduction sauce is money!"}
{"text":"We have dined at this chain for over 20 years. It was one of our favorites. Well bubba, those days are long gone. Ate at the one nearest us in Savannah and noticed the flavor and quality of my dinner (Pasta Rustica) was not up to par. Server said the new owners are all about the bottom line and are changing the recipes. Hello new owners; this is a recipe for disaster. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" 

Decided to give them one more shot. Big mistake pigboy! The Carbonna was horrible, and that is as kind as I can get. Do they have a corporate taste kitchen? It was a bucket of dry pasta with some cheese and meat. A poached egg on top? Not the way to do it. Egg is an integral part of the recipe, not an add-on to pretend this is breakfast too. I tried to eat it but simply could not; even after dousing it with olive oil. There was no sauce; no moisture. Besides, the egg pasta was too thick. 

Server did a good job. I asked to speak to the manager. She was gracious and, to her credit, comped my dinner and gave us a free desert. Class act. 

But that was the last time. If you have patronized this place over the years before it was sold, you can now forget them. Do not waste your money."}
{"text":"Disappointed. It used to be great, but the pasta was undercooked and the server/hostess forgot to provide extra settings and vinegar, etc."}
{"text":"Well, it is Saturday night (June 15th), planning on celebrating my wife's birthday at a nice place and also brought our three teenage kids. Here goes:  Got to restaraunt at 5:30, and was seated right away. Problem was the hostess was seating the dining room from the back.  The room was about 1/3 full and we were all being crammed together. The tables were so close together, you had to shuffle sideways to get through.  
Ok enough of that, once seated, remember we are a 5 top, we only have settings for 4. Hostess leaves us with menus and disappears.  10 minutes later a toothless waiter that had such poor dental he was virtually unable to speak, brought a bottle of house wine and tried to sell. We politely declined and he said he would be back to take our orders.  He did not ask us if we wanted any beverages and we still had no water or bread on the table.  Toothless returned after another 10 minutes ( he was being kept busy by other tables returning improperly cooked fod to the kitchen). We placed our orders and asked about water and bread, he said there was freash bread in oven and it would be ready shortly--obviously a trained response as other diners were eating bread and had soft drinks.
Toothy comes back with a carafe of water and fills 4 glasses and is ready to leave and i remind him we are a party of 5.  He grabs a glass from another table and fills another.  Okay---we have been seated for 30 minutes now and we just got water and still no bread. I take an eager sip of water only to discover warm tap. I folded my napkin on my empty bread plate and escorted my family out of the establishment.  On way out i spoke to the manager to cancel our food order and explain what a horrible dining experience we had just encountered.  I will never ever set foot into this chain again, to many other places for my hard earned money."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star for the friendly waitresses. The food portion sizes for to-go are horrible . I paid a lot of money for kid portion sizes... will not return or recommend. I recommend those waitresses go elsewhere ."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to MG on Friday 8/8/14 at 6:15 PM.Sat there 15 mins
Before our waiter appeared. Ordered chicken parm. Forty minutes later still no food and they wouldn't even produce a manager! We got up and left.
This will be our last time."}
{"text":"Eh! Just ok. The staff were nice and attentive, however I would like to see a more diversified wait staff. Came for lunch at noon."}
{"text":"The food is much better than the other chain Italian restaurants.  The food and ambiance are much better than the neighborhood pizza joint that also sells veal parm etc.  The wine selection is poor, the table Chianti is a little less than mediocre.  The service was exceptionally good.  It is not fine dining by any stretch, and it is not as good as you should expect your neighborhood Italian restaurant to be.  But it was much better than we expected, and we will be back."}
{"text":"Our server was fabulous. We ate in the bar, I believe her name was steph. When I told her I would rather have eaten there than bonefish grill, and told her about the non birthday dessert, she brought us one. Great customer service"}
{"text":"I don't even know why so many of you are hating on the macaroni Grill. We ate there tonight and Kathy was our server. She was outstanding and so was the food. I know it's not Mario Battalii down at the Venetian, which we hated, but it's extremely good for the price. The new half pound meatball and pasta dish is outstanding. The bread is great, the service was fantastic. The only surprise is that the place isn't busier. If you haven't tried it in a while give it another try."}
{"text":"Looking forward  to our new experience  for the Macroni  Grill. What a terrible  experience.  The server had a chip on his shoulder  noticed  it when we first was seated. Waited 10 minutes  for our first bread to arrive,  I have to say it was hot. Ordered our food, when it arrived it was COLD. My advice  to anybody wanting Italian  food take your business to Olive Garden.our server need to find a job he enjoys. TERRIBLE  FOOD AND THE SERVICE WAS EVEN WORSE. YOU HAVE A CHOICE.  
TAKE YOUR BUSINESS  AND MONEY  SOMEWHERE  ELSE."}
{"text":"Macroni Grill, was once a great restaurant chain. Now, it's dying a slow death, all because the value of customer service, proper restaurant management have long gone. You can't rest on the laurels of the brand that was once exceptional!"}
{"text":"Wanting to get off The Strip for calmer atmosphere and reasonable prices we went here and glad we did.  We had eggplant parm, chicken parm, lobster ravioli and 2 kids meals (pizza and spaghetti & meatballs).  Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I don't know what is going on with this location, but it is bad. Very dirty, stacks of dirty dishes piled up in the middle of the dinning room! My pasta came burnt (crispy noodles!) yuck. We went for lunch and there was only a few people there. Makes me wonder where all the dirty dishes came from and how long they had been sitting there. Skip this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary. One of our favorite places to eat, only to find out that it's permanently closed!  :(  next nearest one is 20+ miles away. Looks like another good restaurant in Mesa bites the dust.  RIP Macaroni grille. Say hi to Lonestar, El Paso, and TGIFridays for us. Btw there were 8 cars in the parking lot just at surprised as I was."}
{"text":"We go here a lot. The food and wine are good and reasonably priced. I'm a little disappointed because sometimes they take our favorite meals off the menu, but maybe what we like not everybody does.  One thing we love is their entertainment-- one waitress has a beautiful voice and she just breaks out in song, and the other night they had a roving magician-- lots of fun!  Good food, good wine, good entertainment!"}
{"text":"I will never be visiting this Macaroni Grill again. I booked my company's intimate holiday party here, reserved the private room and decided the 4 course meal was perfect for our event. When we arrived, the hostess had no idea that we had a reservation. We were finally taken to the back room where there were 4 individual tables set up to hold 10 people each. I had requested place settings for 20 and hoped to have one large table, but our group had to split up. We sat down to find the full menu in front of us and when I went and spoke to the manager about our condensed 4 course menu, she said they placed the wrong menus down. I already felt upset that I had confirmed this appointment 2 times and it was not put together, but tried not to let it ruin my experience. Our server was all over the place and should NOT have been waiting on a private party. One of our guests had to ask multiple times for an item because it had been continuously forgotten. The delicious bread with oil and pepper everyone is talking about did not happen; we were given bread and there was olive oil bottles on the table, but no plates, no pepper, nothing. We were each suppose to receive an appetizer, instead they brought out one of each kind for the table to share. Overall, the service and \"lack of communication\" (words from the manager herself) really turned this dinner into an unorganized and stressful night."}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill used to be on my go-to list to satisfy a pasta craving, and as I recall there was ALWAYS a wait to be seated. When we walked in tonight I did a double take.... Friday night, 7:30pm, and the place is half empty... woahhhh.... red flag!!!! We were seated quickly, our waiter Lemmand was efficient (hence the one star). My favorite bread arrived, it was good but the olive oil for dipping tasted rancid.  I ordered Lasagne and hubby ordered Carmelas Chicken. Entrees now include a Cesar Salad, but these were disappointing, wilty romaine and bagged grated parm topped with non descript dressing. The entrees arrived, my $16 portion of lasagne was small and tasted like canned ravioli topped with crushed tomatoes. I couldn't eat it (TOTALLY out if character for me). Hubby's chicken was not much better. We were very disappointed and I'm sad to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our server Jaime was excellent, the wait was about right. At first I was thinking that for the price we did not get much food but, WOW. The food was good and was filling, the food was season well and nothing that we ate was over done or under done."}
{"text":"Have been going to the place since it opened in the 90's.  Over the past few years the service has really taken a dive at this location. 

It seems to me that this bad service is not the fault of the wait staff, but more the fault of whoever is managing this place.  The wait staff is always running around frantically trying to tend to all of their tables. It is apparent that the place is chronically understaffed or whatever workflow they have is not effective. 

If you do have the patience to through the process of getting the waiter's attention, and ordering drinks, and waiting for bread that is almost always \"in the oven\", waiting to order desert, and waiting for the check, the food isn't that bad."}
{"text":"Love the location in Scottsdale, but our experience at the Desert Ridge restaurant was truly awful. Seated in a location so dark I could not read the menu even with my glasses, it didn't start well. Our waitress leaned over me continually trying to take the drinks order which was annoying. No bread came. We asked about the bread and got \"so you want bread\". Dinner was poor to say the least. My daughter's chicken was rubbery and tasteless and husband's sausages were inedible. The management agreed and deleted two items from the bill. We took the instant survey and got a call to say there would be a gift certificate on its way, but a month has gone by and nothing turned up. My advice, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss on service! Also waitress tried to up our bill without our knowledge. Make sure you ask if that is part of the meal, because they will not tell you it is an additional charge."}
{"text":"The food is better than the OG. Nice atmosphere, good hearty pasta dishes...what's not to like?!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with family. The service we received felt very subpar. It felt like we were being rushed to choose our drinks and food. That wasn't a very big deal though, to be honest.

However, after I finished meal I found myself wanting to leave. I ordered a Grilled Salmon. My first impression of when I first received it was that it visually looked very good. After I stuck my fork in for the first bite I was a bit disappointed. I struggled to stab my salmon and my meal completely fell apart on me. The interior of my salmon was undercooked while the exterior was overcooked. As for the taste, it was decent. Nothing special but it wasn't terrible as it sounds. Wouldn't order it again if I came back a second time.

Since it's my birthday, I was given a small birthday cake with a candle. Another worker had accompanied our server and sang Happy Birthday to me in Italian! I was quite pleased with this. His voice was great! 

As for the birthday dish itself, I was excited to dig into it. I took the candle out and began eating. Unfortunately, the dish was rock solid. Being optimistic I thought it would just be hard on the outside and soft on the onside. I was wrong. It was very hard and dry all the way to the bottom. 

All in all, it was a generally decent atmosphere and environment but I do not think I would come here again if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Came by for a late lunch today. Shane, our waiter was very attentive and answered all of our questions kindly and with ease. The $7 menu made in 7 minutes or its free is a great option for a quick lunch with lots of tasty options like chicken parm and caprese sandwiches as well as insalatas and pastas. My lunch was excellent today, bravo!"}
{"text":"This was absolutely the worst experience I have had a restaurant in many moons.....Wine list has been shortened....the one pinot grigio (Italian white) is an unknown brand and at $34 bottle was way too pricey.....I would expect to pay that for Santa Margherita a well know delicious pinot grigio.  The bartender/waiter was obviously a newby and training was apparently slim or NONE.  Our salads were fabulous (Bibb & Bleu) & bread yummy but the service made everything good into bad.  Would someone please, please train your staff before you sick them on us!!!  The guy didn't even have a pen for us to sign our cc slip....hello sir, this is how you get your tips!!!!"}
{"text":"Total disappointment. We went to celebrate my son's birthday because it was one of his favorite places. The place was dead. Not even 20% of the restaurant was occupied on a Friday night.  That should have been my first clue. The music was not the traditional Italian style they used to play.  The menus were dirty. The tales unbussed. It took over 5 minutes before a waiter came to greet us and when he did,  he started by asking how it was going and if we want to have the wine. Uh, not the introduction of welcome. The dining experience was more like a pizza joint or bar. I realize it isn't the Capital Grille, but we have experienced a bit more formality at this place in the past.
The food was bad too. Bread was old, pasta overcooked, chicken was way over seasoned. We waited a long time for our salad to come out. Our waiter seemed overwhelmed by his 3 tables. So the attention we should have had in a restaurant with only 11 tables occupied and 6 or 7 person wait staff did not happen. 
We will never return."}
{"text":"Went with a small group (seven). Everyone ordered different plates and were satisfied with their portions and 
server/staff timeliness to serve. 
The cloth napkins (as opposed to paper napkins) and silverware ( as opposed to flimsy silverware) was a nice touch.
Our server was attentive. I heard that this Mac. Grill was more commercialized and, therefore, dropped in service and compromised quality. Not applicable at this particular location in Goodyear.
We were, for the most part,  satisfied with the food, service and ambience. My wife and I would eat at this location again on a date night."}
{"text":"Tried Calling to make reservation. No one picks up the phone. Decided to dine at Carrabus"}
{"text":"10/22/2011 was the date of our visit.  Food was just okay, server was just okay.  The manager climbed up on the food prep counter to fix a light.  We felt like that was the most unsanitary thing anyone could do - he could have just come from the restroom for all we knew.  Needless to say, lackluster service, mediocre food and lack of concern for the cleanliness of the food prep area will guarantee we will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Was here recently and service was terrible plus food was not as tasty as it has been at other Macaroni Grills I have been to.  Our waitress disappeared for a good 20 minutes before she even brought us water.Took forever to get our food and it was mediocre.  I was really surprised because I have eaten at several Macaroni Grills in valley, Tucson and in other states."}
{"text":"I am sorry I can't give less than 1 star. I sat there for 20 minutes with my family and was ignored. It was very slow and the worst part was that the manager went to the table next to us twice and did not bother to say anything. Will never step foot at this place again."}
{"text":"Service was horrible and food was mediocre at best~ won't be going back"}
{"text":"A very negative and unhappy vibe from the employees here. Not even a parting goodbye when leaving. Server was decent but I have had better. The bread was fresh and the Caesar salad was very good. The Bolognese sauce was very bland and dry. Reading the reviews on this location it sounds like it needs a management and staff overall.. and possibly positions higher than this. Good luck !"}
{"text":"Romano's Macaroni Grill has it's nerve to serve Italian food!  First of all, when they bring the EVOO, they don't put fresh herbs in the oil like Carrabbas, they put black pepper! The Caesar salad had so little dressing on it that I had to order extra.  I ordered Chicken Parm with a side of fettuccine Alfredo instead of spaghetti with red sauce..  When my dinner was served, they gave me spaghetti  with so little red sauce the noodles were white and the chicken was grilled, with cheese on top that wasn't even melted and NO sauce, just a smear on the plate.  The chicken was so tough I couldn't cut it with a knife.  I returned it, the 2nd dish was fried chicken with unmelted sauce and a smear of sauce and the fettuccine had so little sauce it was sticky.  My husband had the BBQ steak, medium rare and it came out medium well.  The waitress didn't have a clue about anything on the menu and had to keep asking other people simple questions.  This was absolutely the worst meal we have had and will NEVER step foot in Romano's Macaroni Grill again.  I wish we had gone to Carrabbas instead!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the first time.   I cannot say enough praises.  I haven't had such excellent service as I received yesterday.  Cheryl was our wait person.  She was very attentive, even made suggestions from the menu and spent a good amount of time answering our questions.  I ordered the Shrimp Portofino (my friend had a chicken dish).  I haven't had Italian food this good since I left Chicago!!!!

Want to make sure Cheryl is recognized for her outstanding service!!!!  Thank you Cheryl for making our visit so enjoyable!  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences in a long time. Food arrived cold. One of the sausages on my meal was hard as a rock. The server had the meals reheated, and replaced the sausage, but my GF's meal was over nuked. The server had it replaced, but by that time it was getting late and the damage had been done. These dinners were not cheap, both at about $18 a pop.
The dinner my GF had, chicken scallapini, consisted of 2 small, pounded flat pieces of chicken. They were almost medallion sized as opposed to previous way they used to do it with actual chicken breasts. To top it off, our server messed up the check, did not give us credit for the $10 coupon we had. 
We wondered when we went in to the restaurant why there were only 5 tables occupied. Now we know."}
{"text":"Our last visit has put us off for awhile. The food used to be amazing, but it is bland and tasteless now.  I've had shrimp at Baja fresh that tasted better.  My fettucini was bland and my husband's lasagna was watery.  Service was ok...she ignored us for awhile, which bothered us.  Basically, we aren't blown away with the food anymore and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to having dinner here tonight. We stood around waiting to be seated for a party of 5. No body around to greet us. Chef saw us waiting and did not even greet or knowledge us. I would give 0 star but the Ap would not let me. This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"It was a horrible experience all together.  For starters it was NOT busy in the restaurant in Desert Ridge Market place. The hostess acted like a deer in headlights and her ability to seat our family of 5 was as painful as watching paint dry. Austin was the server, there was no plates or silverware. He placed the bread on the table and was gone for greater than 5 minutes. We asked for water while waiting on our ice tea. We grabbed plates and silverware off of the table a few steps away, he was not knowledgeable about the menu or the portion size, and did not offer to refill any of the ice teas as the glasses were obviously empty. Even after I asked for him to bring water for one of the children. Never did water arrive to the table nor did Austin ask to refill any of the empty ice tea glasses.  After speaking with the manager of the restaurant he lacked any concern for the unacceptable poor service, not even any words to apologize for the lack of service. Never again will I take my father who is a POW/MIA Vietnam Veteran into this establishment."}
{"text":"I wish there was zero stars. I literally seat there for 10 with nobody even asking for drinks. I just left. Horrible horrible service !!!! The place was empty. Will never recommend."}
{"text":"Wow!  We should have read the reviews before we went here. The service is horrible. We had stacks of appetizer plates and salad bowls on the table and no one removed them until we asked. Next we received our entrees and my wife's pasta wasn't cooked and the chicken in my pasta dish was raw as well. The final straw was a manager we observed wiping his nose then picking up food and delivering it to a table. Sorry this place should be closed!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, bland food, burnt pizza crust. Only reason we didn't walk out was the lovely food server Vagana. Will not go again, the end of a family tradition. Time to pick a new italian restaurant for next year."}
{"text":"The only reason for a 2 star is food is good. Service was so horrible. Gave  Kelsi so many chances. After 30 minutes had to ask another staff member to check on appetizer. When brought over it was  cold. Amazing how the new appetizers came out in 5 minutes. 2 of three orders incorrect. She had no sense of working in the service industry. She was horrible. Had to ask many other service  people for help as she was consistently MIA. stuff goes wrong. Never apologized for anything. She almost seemed like she was in Anti depressants as nothing was upstairs.  When she finally brought over our to go boxes she said I will be right back with check. That took 15 minutes. And I had to ask someone to get her !!!  NO TIP. I refuse to tip for horrible service anymore"}
{"text":"We had a great experience eating here. Our waitress, Cindi, was friendly and fun. She brought a bottle of their house wine and small water glasses to sample the wine. The bottle is left at the table through dinner to drink if you wish. It reminded me of Olive Garden bringing wine samples. We had the Mama Trio. It was delicious. Soooo much food. There were 2 of us but we could have shared it with another person. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"We eat here several times a year.  This is excellent italian food.  The \"create your own pasta\" menu choice is a hit with us - you can choose from several types of pasta, sauces, veggies, and sausage or meatballs.  The salmon and shrimp scampi dinners are outstanding as well.  Maggiano's is still at the top of my list for italian, but Romano's is a close second."}
{"text":"Let's just say \"Olive Garden lost my business\" and I rather go to Romano's Macaroni Grill. The night my husband was leaving for a long tour, he decided he wanted to go to olive garden for his last meal since its his favorite place to eat. well I called and the lady said we didnt need a reservation. well when we arrived lets just say that they had a wait time of 45 minutes I was so pissed off, and i explained our situation that hubby was leaving for a military tour and he was about to leave in 3 hours is there anything she could do for us since someone gave us wrong information and since he leaving for a long tour. she said no but you can sit at the bar, well the bar was packed too. so after walking out in tears because I was emotional wreck with hubby leaving and wanting to give him a nice dinner before he leaves. we almost just decided to give up and just go to airport but then i mentioned about a pasta place down the road, we decided to just try it. the Macaroni grill was on the 95/rainbow, lake mead location

I was shocked that this place had freaking AWESOME SERVICE!!!!! I told the waitress that we had little time and that once the food came out just to bring check and not only did we have food in less than 20 minutes but the food was amazing. I had the salmon dish and hubby had some pasta meal. we also the waitress sing opera music to us and suprisingly she was good. we also had free dessert on us for being military. I loved the food, the table you could draw on, service and the cost. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. This place def. knows how to treat their customers. we were in and out in less than 40 minutes. I was just amazed that someone listened to me and actually took the time to please the customer. GOODBYE Olive Garden.....Don't waste your time your money or time there say.Hello Romano's Macaroni Grill...where the food is actually worth going to."}
{"text":"It had been awhile since last eating here, so I was excited in hopes of a good dinner.  Service was barely ok, but the food was just tasteless, bland and they seemed to give a lot of the stuff. 
Server forgot to bring my daughters soup, brought it with her dinner. We ordered two of our meals without any chicken. Half way through the meal, we found something that looked like chicken but it so tough it could not be cut. We ask the server what the heck it was and she took it off to the kitchen area.  She returned and said it was chicken...really tough chicken are her exact words!  Gross!!
I had the Shrimp Portofino, again, a lot of it, and it was so bland, I had to add olive oil, salt and pepper it was still only ok.  The Shrimp had the tails still on, which was difficult to eat around and strange.  
We explained that we ordered no chicken, due to not eating any meat, and it was gross, they did nothing ...but bring us our bill.  Then....THAT LADY started to sing to us. We quickly paid and left....never to return!
On a previous visit to this location, we were with a large group and my youngest daughter was sitting at the end of the table and the waiter spilled an entire glass of lemonade on her.  She was not injured, but very uncomfortable. Apologies offered, nothing more. So with this experience and tonight's....we will never return!  Stay clear !"}
{"text":"We had a birthday party there last night, and we were really disappointed with the experience.  There were 7 of us, and 5 of us arrived at 5:30pm (our reservation time) and the other two came about 5:45 pm (traffic delayed them).  We were not offered any drinks while we waited for the other two to arrive.  Then the other two guests arrived and it took a while for our server to come take our order--even just drinks.  We finally placed our order and it took something like 45 minutes for our orders to come.  Our server was working hard, but it seemed to us that he had too many tables to take care of (though the restaurant was not super crowded, he seemed to have to cover quite a large area).  It was extremely hard for our two 4-year-old grandkids to wait 45 minutes for some macaroni, but they did their best.  The food, when it finally arrived, was mediocre at best.  My husband had a shell in his lobster ravioli, the bread seemed stale, and my shrimp salad was bland and had only 4 shrimp (though the shrimp was yummy) on it.  This place has really gone downhill.  We used to love the food and the service was usually good, too.  I'm not sure if the long wait was because of the kitchen or the server, so I'm not sure who's at fault there.  Our server was pleasant and helped us with our birthday gift pile and brought a piece of birthday cake to my husband (it was dry).  I think he was trying his best and was working hard, so I left him a decent tip for his efforts (hey, waiting tables is hard).  I don't think we'll be back to this place for a very long time.  It was so disappointing."}
{"text":"Great Food at a reasonable price. Not sure what prior reviews are talking about.  The service was great, food was delicious, nice clean relaxing restaurant.  Can't ask for more at this price point."}
{"text":"My friend picked up food here for us and her chicken was hardly cooked! Another friend had the same problem! I think this sums it up!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Macaroni Grill for years.  While in TX, I ate at one almost every other night.  I eat only whole wheat pasta, so gluten free and regular pasta is not for me.  It even got where every one in the grill knew me.  Then I moved to an area without Macaroni Grill.  Yesterday, I went to this Macaroni Grill and to my surprise they do not have whole wheat possible.  Therefore, I was not able to eat there.  Heather (my server) was wonderful and very apologetic for not having what I wanted.  Others were not too thrilled and let me know it.

I suppose the Macaroni Grill drops off of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Dig it.  Totally great food.  I know it is a chain but much better than anything else out there (Italian), in my opinion."}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant regularly because it is close to home and always meets our expectations. The food is always great and reasonably priced. The staff is also very friendly. We eat in the bar sometimes because the wine is 2 bucks cheaper per glass. We really like this particular Macaroni Grill at Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"we (me and my woman) swear by yelp!  if a restaurant doesn't get 4 stars, we won't go, end of story.  
thus, when we found ourselves with a $20. gift card and we saw a 3 star rating on yelp. we were hesitant.  but, \"money talks and bs walks.\"  so, we decided to take our chances, and  we're glad we did. 
first off, i am a demanding diner and our server, michael, aced it. he was right on spot: pleasant, accommodating and  attentive w/o being annoying. our food came out in a timely fashion but not rushed.  

michael immediately brought out our wine $6.(nice fill) and --the fresh baked rosemary bread...a+.
 
we ordered the 4 course tasting menu $18.00:
fried ravioli...a+, yummy. 
caesar salad...b, fresh crispy lettuce, tasty dressing, but...not enough croutons.
pasta w red sauce...b, large portion, came out nice and hot, waiter grates the cheese over the pasta, nice touch. 

i like my food highly spiced with loads of garlic. even though the sauce wasn't prepared that way, i still enjoyed it,  it wasn't bland or tasteless, by any means. 

chicken marsala, w roasted potatoes...b, tender chicken, good sauce and yummy potatoes.

the waiter made a fresh pot of coffee which we enjoyed w my
birthday dessert and italian opera serenade, from  a lovely lady named sarah.
 
when we rate a restaurant we consider what we were given in  return for our money. in this case we had excellent service, good food, decent size portions and a stress-free relaxing meal. what's there not to like?"}
{"text":"Our server was really really nice but the manager was a jerk!!  Nicole was very attentive and informative but Marce kept butting in and was rude.  I would go here if Marce was not there. The food was really good."}
{"text":"Just went there for lunch with my fiance. This was our 2nd visit in the last year. The hostess was very pleasant and kind. Our server was also very prompt and got our entire order fast and correct. We ordered the Neapolitan pizza (pepperoni) and the Chicken Parmigiana to share. The pizza was fresh and had fresh basil on it. The pizza was small but one person could definitely get full off of it. The only complaint about the pizza is that they went a little flour-happy with the crust and it was a little messy. We just split both entries. The Chicken Parmigiana was OUT OF THIS WORLD...we wished we had gotten 2 orders of that instead of the pizza. We will be back again simply for the service and the Chicken Parmigiana!!"}
{"text":"Normally I'm a big fan of Macaroni Grill--the food is pretty good and I like the atmosphere, but the service at this location is usually lacking unless you can get the one server in the place that seems to know what's going on.  Well, tonight my husband and I decided to order their Carside To Go a) to skip the dining room and most importantly, b) because we found ourselves with no time to cook due to my husband having an appointment at 7pm.  Using the online ordering on their website, I placed our order for 2 entrees (Chicken Scallopini, sans mushrooms and capers, and Carmela's Chicken) and a side salad to be ready for pick-up at 6:15 (which was cutting it a bit close for us as it was, but should have still given us time to pick it up, get home, and eat before my husband had to leave).  My husband called shortly after the order was put in and notified the gentleman at the to-go counter that we were on a time crunch and if it could be done any sooner, he would appreciate it.  He advised my husband to be there at 6pm and he would get it out as quickly as possible.  When my husband arrived at about 5 after, he was told that the food wasn't ready yet and to wait in his car.  6:15 came and went, and no meal was delivered, so he went inside and was told it would be a little longer yet (everything appeared to be packed up except the Chicken Scallopini).  It wasn't until 6:30 that the meal was finally ready, so my husband had to rush home with only 10 minutes left before he needed to leave.  When he arrived and we opened our dishes, I was dismayed to find that the Chicken Scallopini, which had taken so much extra time, included the mushrooms and capers I specifically requested be left off (I double-checked the receipt and it was definitely noted).  Not only that, but the rosemary bread they serve at the table that's usually so warm and fluffy was like a cold brick, flat and cool to the touch, as if it had never been heated (we only live 5 minutes from the restaurant, so it couldn't have cooled that quickly).  I'm severely disappointed after this experience and don't think I will be using the Carside To Go service in the future.  While I do enjoy the food here, we've had some pretty bad service at this location now, both inside and outside of the dining room, and this last incident has brought us to the tipping edge."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for 17 years, and we love it as a romantic getaway.......until tonight. It is our 25th Anniversary, made reservations and couldn't get a booth. Wednesday night, fifty empty tables, and they can only seat us at a table ??!! We had to wait forever for our food that was bland and boring. I could have served better at home. It was frustrating and tarnished a normally perfect record of great service, interesting food, and romantic ambiance. We will have to go elsewhere for awhile."}
{"text":"Took grandkids and daughter to Macaroni Grill last night for dinner.  We got there early, so it was not busy.  Our server was attentive and our drinks were always full.  That didn't seem to matter, though.  It took forever to get our food (keep in mind I have kids with me).  I ordered an expensive chicken dish with potatoes and a vegetable.  The potatoes were not cooked, the vegetable was cold and the chicken was of very poor quality.  I did complain about my meal, which was taken off my bill.  However, the entire experience was disappointing and we won't go again.   There are too many other choices.  Try Carrabas down the way!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick bite on Sunday evening. Sat at the bar. After 10 min and the bartender being busy doing other things, we walked out. Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"They are lucky to get one star.... Very disappointed. Food too salty. Service was terrible, had to get up and get the server to order!! Bathrooms smelled horrible! Will not return!"}
{"text":"I chose this Macaroni Grill for a mid-week family celebration. My family had plenty of suggestions; however, I came up with this place and everyone agreed. 
     It was quite a disappointment. The atmosphere was quite comfortable, there were about 4 customer tables and the rest was empty. The food was great, but I had to wait about 30 minutes before my first order arrived, just to find out that it was the wrong order. It then took another 30 minutes for my food to arrive. By then everyone was done. Then the waitress suggests dessert (while my relatives were holding their coats waiting for me to finish my last bite); not the best experience...
     I was drinking coffee (during the 60 minute lapse) while waiting for my food. I asked the waitress for creamer and Splenda. It took the waitress 25 minutes to bring the creamer, by then the coffee was cold. 
     I do not recommend this particular location. Customer service is a very important factor when it comes to a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here a couple months ago. The service was just bad. Our waiter would disappear for 15 minutes at a time even though he was only servicing I believe one other table...the place was not even half full. Food was good, but not the greatest value. I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Planed on dinner there tonight, that wast utill I saw there sanitation score! 86% that is just horrible, and unacceptable  . There off my list utill that score comes way up"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Thursday night and it was a perfect evening.  Enjoyed a 1/2 off bottle of wine.  Our server Kasandra and she was excellent.  We were offered hot bread right away our dinners were not put in until our appetizer was served so we were able to enjoy each course.  I enjoyed pasta and my husband enjoyed the new salmon dish.  He also had the chocolate dessert.  It was a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"I've been going here off and on for about 3 years. Food is really good and we've never had problem with the order coming out wrong or the food being cold. Margarita's could be bigger for the money you pay. I usually (not always) get good service. The busser's could be better though. I usually end up wiping out the seats before I sit down and the last time I visited (a couple of day ago) their was dried food still on the table when we were sat down."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several Macaroni Grills across the country, but this one was by far, my favorite! My waitress, Shelly, was absolutely amazing. As many times as I have eaten here, I have never been serenaded until tonight. I don't know how she knew that that particular song from The Phantom of the Opera was my favorite one, but, I was awestruck and very impressed! Thank you so much Shelly for an amazing dining experience! I can not wait until I return! Shelly will be my regular waitress every time I eat at that particular location! Amazing voice and great personality. Truly the best part of my whole night!"}
{"text":"I am in North Olmsted for business, and unfortunately I took a customer there for dinner.  We were rushed through our entire meal.  The restaurant was 2/3 empty and we couldn't understand being rushed. 

When we ordered an item we needed a listed item to be served on the side.  When the item arrived it had an unlisted item on it that I couldn't eat.  We immediately told the server and I was chastised for not informing her of the item.   When I explained that I didn't anticipate the item she was still very rude about the situation. 

We were given the dessert menu as soon as our entrees were delivered.  We weren't asked about additional beverages, and the server was not happy when the other diner with me wanted another beverage when she delivered our check.  

Since the restaurant was so empty, we took our time and discussed business.  During the next hour, not one person approached our table once.  

The food was marginal at best....but the service was hideous!!   I am in North Olmsted a week every month, and I guarantee that I won't be back."}
{"text":"What a surprise I had last night. Its been almost 18 months since my last visit and I wish I had not gone there last night. I was anticipating another great dining experience there and I was totally disappointed. My first clue should have been no waiting to get seated on a Sat. Nite at seven thirty. The service was really, really bad. I thought I could not go wrong with the penne rustica...WOW....was I wrong, it was so cold from sitting, the  pasta was dry and discolored, there were 2...two..as in one more than one ....TWO measly shrimp. The server was almost threatening when she said the wine was on the honor system. Meg (server) had NO personality whatsoever. It was the worst dining experience I have had EVER! It would rate zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! I sat at the bar area last night and had a wonderful time. The create your own pasta and the baked Italian dish are great options we personally enjoyed. Happy hour specials on the house wine $3. And they filled the glasses generously :) I had a great time!"}
{"text":"I cook better pasta than them, and I am not much of a cook.

The pasta I had (I believe it was a marinara dish with penne pasta) was awfully bland.
Sauce didn't mix well with the pasta either.
The texture of the pasta was funky, hanging out on its own.
If I wanted bland pasta I would buy a can of Presto and penne pasta, boil them together and add some water :p

The server was attentive enough to notice and brought me more sauce.

I did like the service and how they had the giant white piece of paper and crayons on the table so I could doodle while I waited.

The waitress was very attentive and friendly.

Appetizer: calamari was yummy.

I just wish they could kick it up a notch on the pasta with richer sauces, seasoning, texture, more tomato/meat/cheese and really blending it with their pasta.
 
But I guess that would raise costs/prices huh. :/"}
{"text":"0- on food 
only giving one because customer service was okay. 
Husband and i went were Sunday for their express lunch ... 
7 minuets or under its free.... didn't sound to promising but we tried it out because usually their food is decent. Big mistake. The noodles were nasty.... mushy and tasted like Playdoh. It looked like they just took a can of cream of mushroom soup and pored it over some noodles that had been siting for a day. My husband got the parmesan chicken sandwich, bread tasted microwaved and the sauce was just bland and just no pleasing to the taste buds at all. i am not sure why you would even come up with a express menu if all your going to do is microwave pre cooked food and serve it... 
Will not be returning !"}
{"text":"don't go here. there has been multiple times that i got sat in the bar booths. server never came. bartender just sitting behind the bar not even giving a care to greet guests that are not at their bar as if it is not their problem. food is decent but service ALWAYS  BAD!!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today with my wife. Two hours after we finished my wife was cramping up and needed a couple of trips to the bathroom. She had the Pollo Caprese which she always has when we visit. The food tasted fine while we were eating it. I had no problems with my meal. Just out of curiosity I googled \"Arizona Restaurant Inspections.\" Well, you will be unpleasantly surprised with the last few write ups. They are ugly!!! So be careful eating there and good luck if you do."}
{"text":"I go here quite a lot with the family. I must agree with a few other reviews, the service is lousy. Today was the final straw. I went there by myself because I finally had some along time. Upon entering, I asked for a table for one. He stated that he seats the single people in the bar. I told him that I would prefer to sit in the dining area. He did not like that and since I was giving attitude by him, I gave it right back. I told him that I may be here alone but I am far from single. This shut him right up.

Now, for the service. I do not know if it was because I was by myself or what, but I waited for 15 minutes before anyone even had asked if I had been helped. Which was a big fat NO. I ordered my drink and food. Once, my food arrived, I was not checked on for anything else until I flagged someone down for the check. 

I can honestly say that I will not go back here again, which is really sad because I love there food here."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT!!!Ok going to start by saying I know it's difficult with larger tables who want separate tabs. This evening's dinner was a disaster!!! We had a table of 12 people which in most cases would mean more than one server to help out. We had half a dozen servers and we still didn't get the food we ordered and the wait for drinks was 40 mins plus. My husband ordered a second beer and it took so long he forgot he even ordered it and by the time the server noticed we were done eating. Once we received our food( which none of us got at the same time) it tasted good. We were about an hour and a half into our dinner at this point. We were ready to leave due to the service been so slow we had decided to go else where to drink (this being a birthday dinner we were all prepared to drink and spend some money) it took the server 40 mins to bring half of the checks which weren't even correct. We also had the free birthday cake that they had given the birthday girl was still charged on the tab. After explaining the problem to the female manager on duty she was not helpful. She just stated it takes time to split the checks not even apologizing for the errors with the service given thus far. After another 20 min wait we received some more of the checks (again not correct) another server at this point stated he had helped and they would be corrected asap. We then spoke to a male manager who just handed it back to the female manager who was no help what so ever again. All in all it was almost and 1.5 horse before the checks were correct. Even after all of this there was no apologies given or no offer the give the birthday girl comped food. It was the most horrific meal experience we have ever had! Never returning and I hope the female manager understands that she lost business for this restaurant from more than just our table of 12. We all will be sure to tell everyone about this experience!! I would never eat here again. Ever."}
{"text":"I consider myself a foodie.. We just came back from a three week Italian trip and was craving some Italian food. With Macaroni Grill's new Happy Hour menu from 3-close and new regular menu.. oh my!! It's our new happy hourfavorite!! You have to try itout!! You'll like the live music, too!"}
{"text":"I hate to give 1 star, so 2 will do. 

My boyfriend and I came here for dinner around 6:00 on a Sunday evening, it looked a little busy so the 10 minute wait for a booth sounded great! The manager apologized and I assured him we were fine with that.

 
First, the poor hostess was so lost and confused,  she was wondering around looking so stressed out trying to help buss tables, looked like her first job. The busser was no where to be found I only saw him twice the whole night, it almost seemed as if he was washing dishes and didn't have time to buss. The whole night we sat with the last tables dirty cups and dishes stacked above our head at the booth.

Second, Our bartender was our server so I expected a little wait, no one brought us bread until we asked, and when brought out it was just thrown on the table, no oil was served or anything,  nobody even introduced themselves. Meanwhile,  our order went in at 6:20 at 6:50 our main dish was served, it looked as if it was sitting on the counter for 15 minutes and a little cold, but wasn't to big to complain so we just asked for some extra sauce to moist it back, by 7:10 the extra sauce was delivered as well as our appetizer salads... My boyfriend has order the chicken parmesan,  he asked for bowtie noodles and unfortunately got thick string noodles.

Hey my pinapple mojito was delicious!!

Finally, our check was brought out our bartender apologized for the horrible service he knew was served and comped everything from our bill except  our salads, I was thankful.

I wanted to add a server in particular,  unfortunately I do not know his name, but I made sure I went out of my way to thank him for everything because he was the one making sure we ordered, our food was delivered, our condiments were brought out, refilled waters, he basically did everything, defiantly the only one who could hold his composure at a busy rate."}
{"text":"I had never been to this place until I was looking for a caterer for my wedding that wasn't too expensive. I went with my then fiance and a friend and we all ordered a different dish to test out. The chicken scallopini was a clear winner. I was pleasantly surprised! We had them cater our wedding (buffet style) and the food was a hit. It was also in our budget and we were quite happy.  If you need to order food for a group, this is a very good and affordable option."}
{"text":"The chicken parmigiana sandwich under the express lunch is the tastiest and a great deal $7."}
{"text":"First and last visit to Macaroni grill! 
1 star is for the ambience which is good. Our group was 2 couples and we ordered 2 types of pasta, soup and flatbread. 
Food - Food was horrible. Flat bread was full of white flour on the bottom, we had to literally scrap the flour out of it. Finally we decided to leave it because one could have a stomach ache with so much uncooked flour. Soup was served cold with basil leaves which were dry. Pasta was ok but too greasy. 
Service - Our server's name was Austin and it felt as if he was not at all interested to service us. He did not have the silverware on the table, we had to ask for it. Half way through the meal, we had to ask him if he would serve bread and olive oil. He got some bread but kept it and left with nowhere to be seen for another 10-15 mins. We ordered 2 pasta but we got only one. Intentionally we didn't say anything because we were already pissed off by then. When the bill came, the pasta which never came was there in the bill, so we had to get that removed. 

Please avoid this restaurant! It is not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"I give them one star for being open. Other than that...service was horrible, they ran out of the pasta for the dish ordered and a roach measuring almost three inches ran across my friends foot then up the wall behind the wine bottles. The manager just moved us to the table next to where we were sitting. Oh and did I mention the restaurant was empty!  Needless to say I will never go back to this neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"The service my party of ten and I received this afternoon was terrible. It took an exceptionally long amount of time to even receive salads. When they did come out, about 45 minutes after we ordered, it was one and two at a time. Salad was quickly followed by food that was \"warm\" at best. We were one of maybe a dozen tables on a Sunday afternoon and we were completely dissatisfied with the service. When we spoke to the manager he was quick to blame the quality of service on it being our server's \"first Sunday\". I was very disappointed in a restaurant that is usually on point."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for some time.  Went late on a Friday with only 2 tables being served. Very disapointing.  Food portions much smaller and prices more expensive than I remember.  Wait staff very talkative and offended one of my dining companions."}
{"text":"We use to love this place....but we will never be back again after two consecutive trips of lousy service and food.  

One visit, I ordered pesto sauce with pasta.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, that was the only part done right.  The pesto had no flavor.  I was a watery green thin and oily sauce.  Didn't taste basil or nuts of any kind.  By far the worst pesto sauce I have ever had!   The portion was a joke too!  All the pasta on my dish could fit inside my baby's 8 oz bottle!  I'm not a big eater by any means, this was a perfect portion for me, but for the price there should had been at least double the amount of food!

They use to have a mango ice tea that was really good, but they did not have it the last couple of visits.  The bread is ok, but the entree doesn't come with soup or salad, something just doesn't seem right with that.  For the price they charge, dessert should be included!  

My children each ordered a kids meal, grilled chicken breast was very thinly sliced, about as thick as two quarters, so it was over cooked, burnt and bland.  Don't even bother with it!  Spaghetti and meat sauce was also bland!!  The kids size meal was the the same size as my meal, but half the price!

My boss treated us last week, again, poor poor experience.  Very consistent with the previous visit, but we were at the Bell Road location.  Portion was very small, I guess they want everyone to eat less pasta because its a fatten food.  They want you to really feel like you are in Europe!   Children's entree, chicken tenders,  was again over cooked and dry.   My shrimp pasta dish had 5 pieces of shrimp for $16.99!  Do I feel rip off!  

Good Bye to Mac Grill, you are a Closed Chapter."}
{"text":"Really one of the worst meals I have ever had.  The stuffed mushroom appetizers were cold, calamari was  bland and rubbery , the prosciutto and mozzarella cheese had flavor ..only because the prosciutto was salty....My eggplant parm  was tasteless, pasta over cooked, the lasagna was burnt and the pasta was over cooked...the fish had too much flavorless breading...blandblandbland... We talked to the manager and she said they have a new cook and he need to put more salt and pepper in the food...yeah..that won't help. ICK! If you have taste buds don't go here.
On a good note...our server Lamad was really great. If not for him, this place would have really been a total loss."}
{"text":"This was one of my top 5 places to eat, and would have got 5 stars a few months ago. It has gone down hill since then. Prices have gone up while portion sizes has dropped. This time I got the oil for the bread, but no bread. I watched my order sit in the pickup window for more than 6 minutes. I started timing after watching it sit so it was more than 6 minutes. The place was not packed, plenty of open seats and lots of staff. I was asked by 2 people if i was being helped, I thought I was but the person helping me just disappeared for a time. Ate here at least 2 times a month for over 2 years but never again."}
{"text":"It's a chain, so you can't expect too much. But for the price, I would not complain too much neither. Just make sure before going there for dinner, you date is either 1) craving for Italian, 2) you do not have a great budget, and 3) you do not want to think too much. Those were my reason to go - after experiences from other location of this chain.
But for this location, again, it was alright. Staff were friendly enough comparing with other locations, and chef did his/her job well. Will go again if I meet those 3 criteria above next time."}
{"text":"Like a scene right out of the Sopranos, bada bing bada boom!  If you have ever watched the Sopranos, you would often see them dining at Macaroni Grill.  The food and service are great here, I have never had a bad meal!  The meals all come with complimentary bread served with olive oil and fresh cracked pepper, which is nice.  They have blackberry mint iced teas that are awesome, I get one every time I go.  They also have a full service bar, and a great wine selection.  The atmosphere is very romantic, with soft lighting, white table clothes, complete with a wood burning fireplace.  They also have great pizza that they make in a real wood fired oven.  I have even seen the owner of a local Italian restaurant eating here, so you know the food is good!  So overall this place is great, and I highly recommend!  If you are in the Strongsville area, and are hungry for Italian, give Macaroni Grill a try!"}
{"text":"Before I begin this review, I will say that I've had a couple of other trips to this same Macaroni Grill location, and both of them have been satisfactory. However, this last trip I had was the absolute worst. The waitress was rude, and unhelpful as far as her knowledge about the wines were concerned. Our food took 45 minutes to and hour to arrive, and it when it did, it was so unappetizing. Not to mention the fact that I had ordered two glasses of wine and the waitress \"forgot\". All the pasta dishes at the table (there were five of us), were cold and had that hardened look to it that pasta has when it's left out too long.The only item that we ordered that came out decently, was the calamari. We did bring this to the attention of the manager, who was very nice and gave us 50% off of our whole meal. I was just extremely disappointed with the service, and don't plan to return to this location again."}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill is a chain, yes. But I'm a fan because their light menu is actually as tasty and flavorful as the main selections, which is definitely not true of all chains, where I have eaten some ungodly flavorless messes in the name of health. You'll feel full after a Macaroni Grill light meal, but you won't feel sick, which is a perk in my opinion. I grabbed dinner here last week and was pleasantly reminded of this."}
{"text":"My family used to go to Macaroni Grill all the time for years and really enjoyed it, but over our past few visits in the course of a year or so, it seems like the quality of the food has declined.  The Chicken Scaloppine is a family favorite, but it's been very salty the past few times I've ordered it.  The portion also seems increasingly modest for the price.  The service is still very good, though, and it's disappointing to feel like I don't really want to go there anymore."}
{"text":"this place needs to be closed down!!!! People pleAse don't eat here. My son used to work here and it's so disgusting. He quit because it was so nasty. He shared theses pic with me I couldn't believe it!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  It started when I asked for a different table and the hostess said no. That should have been my clue.  The food was tasteless.  I have ordered the shrimp portofino several times previous.  I always thought it was good.  But tonight it was awful. I'll never come here again."}
{"text":"Need to start off with a quick, all encompassing comment to sum up this dump, BOOOOOOO! 

It took literally ten minutes for a waiter to meander his way to our table ofter being seated, and the restaurant was only about half full at lunch time. And this is the reasoning for the BOOOOOO! assessment...

Service? I was there with my wife and son, but there were only two place settings on the table. I asked for an additional place setting prior to ordering our meals, and when did they bring it? Not two minutes later, not five minutes later, not ten minutes later. It was around five minutes AFTER our meals had arrived that I finally got up and took a place setting from the table next to us, on my own accord! And our waiter walked past the station with the place settings AT LEAST eight times during this period. My F-in pasta was cold by then! In addition, we had to ask for water literally three times before we got it, and again, this was over a ten minute period! Our son's lemonade required equal prodding and requests, we asked at least three times over a ten minute period. Management needs to seriously re-think training, or just cut their loses, and rehire fresh help that knows what they're doing. 

Food? my spaghetti was mediocre, I've made better at home. Wife's pasta, chicken with cream sauce was very, very dry, as was the chicken. same problem with our son's butter noodles, way too dry, butter almost non-existent. I understand that the sauce is the most expensive component in a pasta dish (pasta itself is dirt cheap, especially in the volume that restaurants purchase), but you can find more effective cost cutting measures than skimping on the sauce. 

I hate to say it, but overall, all of the Macaroni Grill trips we've made of late seem to be on par with our experience here. We're from California and the trend of bad service and management seems the norm now. This sucks because we get Brinkers gift cards all the time. Between these jokers and the other Brinker options, Chilis, Maggianos, and On the Border, the one stand out is Maggianos. Their food and service is always top notch. We're sticking with Maggianos from here on out. With the classic pasta dishes there, you get one meal there, and one to take home free. You can't beat that with a stick. 

And the really bad part? You'll never see ANY Macaroni Grill manager ever respond to ANY YELP feedback at ANY location. When I chase my son around to tickle him and I finally get him cornered, he'll turn around and put his hands over his eyes, a child's thought being, \"if I can't see him, he's not there\". Same modus operandi with Macaroni Grill management, it seems.

BOOOOOOOOO!

Cheers."}
{"text":"One star only because I was with family. Long wait for food, forgot my iced tea you're almost 20 minutes, food was edible solely because I was starving. To top it off the  2 portions of chicken parmigiana for myself and 16 year old son were more of a childrens portion with chicken medallions instead off a patty. This along with an $11 penne with butter and parmigiana came to a ridiculous $50. Never again will I waste time and another cent at this chain."}
{"text":"Buyer beware! These fools will tell you that they have a reservation saved for you on the phone, but deny you made it when you show up. A late black woman who somehow plays the role of hostess is rude and doesn't care that they messed up and didn't log your reservation. The food is bland, and the pasta is overcooked and/or nuked. Furthermore, the COOKS got into a fist fight."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here with our two kids on Friday, March 5th, 2016 and will never go back again. We arrived at 6:40pm to a 1/3 full restaurant. Put in our order within a few minutes and received our dinners about 45 minutes later. My wife ordered ravioli, I ordered a penne pasta with arrabiata sauce, my youngest son cheese pizza and my oldest son ordered penne and butter. When the food finally arrived, my son's cheese pizza was ice cold and my pasta was lukewarm at best. The waitress was at times nowhere to be seen so not only did we wait 45 minutes but we struggled to get refills or updates on what was happening in the kitchen. When the waitress finally returned to tell us our food was next she could tell how annoyed we were. She comped my wife a glass of wine for our trouble which is the only reason I didn't put a 0 star rating. It's now obvious to me why this restaurant wasn't full like every other on a Friday night. $70 for cold food and a 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"We have come here for years and after tonight, never again.  They are cheaping out, big time.  No automatic bread; we were asked if we wanted bread.  Prices are up, quantity is down and quality is down.  We could not taste (or see) any dressing on our Caesar salads, and the price was higher.  We were surprised by the menu prices; $11 for a small portion of pasta plus $5 for a meat topping.  We could have gone to a fancier place for that.  And $11 bucks for a small so-so pizza.  Our food did not arrive all at once and we were told that they could not cook moe than one pizza at a time.  Really?  Best to move on; things have gone south.  When they can no longer afford to offer mints on the way out, you know they have problems.  I would not have given even one star, but I had to click something to move on."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here twice in the last year and love it. We have always enjoyed MG's bread with the seasoned dipping oil and the house chianti wine is great. With that said, I usually found the entrees just ok, but the last two times at this MG the food to me was way improved. I ordered the mama's trio and just loved it.  Service and staff were good, but the food is what will bring me back and I hope it is soon. I really don't get the other reviews here.  Come on people, if you love this place like I do leave some positive reviews."}
{"text":"My wife and I had stopped by for a late lunch.  We both ordered the eggplant parm with our meal quickly delivered to our table. My first impression was the two slices of eggplant seemed sliced a bit thin compared to other restaurants we've dine at before, hence the 4 stars.  However the taste and texture of the eggplant and the accompanying angel hair spaghetti was very good.

On a side note, you're provided a small loaf of crusty bread with pure extra virgin olive oil for dipping as you wait for your entrees.  A very nice addition to our meal.

We'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great Service From Our Server Red! Food Was Great! There Maneu Has Changed a Lot Since The Last Time We Were There."}
{"text":"Great Value and Quick service. I was in a party of 23 on a friday night for a birthday party celebration and the service we received was very quick (for a prty of 23 on a Friday night i was impressed with the speed) and friendly. The server even sang an operatic version of happy birthday. The dinner special where you get a salad, main course and dessert (I had the lemon passion, very rich so I recommend you share it) was a great deal for those on a budget. I usually don't eat at chain italian restarants but this was a pleasent surprise."}
{"text":"I use to work here about 5 years ago and now I am embarrassed to have said that.  We went to eat there during the week and there wasn't hardly anybody there.  We ordered a couple of appetizers and they were horrible.  I ate the Pasta Milano and it is usually great, especially when I worked there.  Now, this crap is garbage.  My wife had some rigatoni stuff and it was terrible.  I asked the server what the hell is going on.  He said that the people that own Planet Hollywood had bought the Macaroni Grill brand from Brinker International.  They don't even wear ties anymore and they wear jeans! They don't have a store manager there anymore! This one is garbage and their food sucks. If you don't believe me, then go there yourself.  Food use to be so much better years ago."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is just delicious!!  The staff is excellent.  The waiter we had was very personable.  It's nice to eat in a place once in awhile with real linen table cloths and napkins that isn't over priced.  The Italian ambiance is great right down to the opera in the background.  Both my sister's and my dinners where excellent and of course enough to have some to take home.  It was my sister's birthday and they brought her a wonderful little chocolate cake with dark chocolate sauce whipped cream and a birthday candle!!  Superb!"}
{"text":"I have been here in the past and it has been MUCH better than this,  It has been while and I am not crazy about chain Italian food, but this is so much better than Olive Garden.  That said, we were out on 3/8 for my b-day and I chose this place because was easy to get my 94 year old grandma in and out of , the food appeals to all the people involved and price wise not too bad.  

We were seated with speed and as we were sitting down, the table to our right was finishing up.  They left and their table went un-bused the ENTIRE time we were there, and it was bothersome as some of our party had to look at it the entire meal.  Wine glasses, butter, bread, dishes.  The whole shebang.  Gross.  I couldn't get what I really wanted as they changed the menu, so what I got was fine.  It was supposed to have a lemon butter sauce that had no lemon whatsoever in it.  I am lemon freak but even the boyfriend couldn't find it, so is was not just me.  Our waitress vanished when I needed to rethink my order and said that it would be  a minute, it was more like 10.  Our orders were not as hot as they should have been and my dish came with artichokes that were either raw or cooked right.  They still had a an inedible membrane attached to the outer layer, so that was unpleasant and not excusable on the kitchens part  Waitress redeemed herself with the cheese ( I LOVE cheese, chocolate and lemons.)   And I got a very nice chocolate cake type desert on the house for the b-day.

All in all, not impressed and reluctant to go back to at least this location for a while."}
{"text":"Its been a long while since I've eaten here, but we had family in town and with the varied tastes, I figured this place would be a safe bet for a little for everyone. But it's all changed. There was not a single item on the menu that I remembered from Macaroni Grill. I think this place was bought out and the new company just kept the name but everything else is different. Despite the restaurant being empty, it still took 15minutes or so to seat our group. Our server seemed to be the only server in the place, perhaps that's why he was less than attentive. Half the menu is the bar (specialty drinks, wine, beer) we were encouraged to order family style (less work for the kitchen?) The mozzarella a la caprese, usually ordered as an appetizer to share, is now featured and presented as an individual salad-same price, 1/3 amount of food- served on an long rectangular plate with a long fancy drizzle of over-starched balsamic perhaps to distract form the lack of actual food .The server was slow and made mistakes on the ordering. (A lemonade was ordered, he placed it as a bar order-specialty drink, more expensive and no refills: The salad I ordered was supposed to only be dressed w/lemon but had so much oil on it my mouth was coated 2 bites in,  it was supposed to be shrimp and I got scallops, some of which were burned on one side and still served (with the burnt side down) 
The Caesar salad was overdressed and came in the teeniest little bowl- like a side salad but for actual serving size price. A chicken pasta dish was served on on an oblong platter as a pile of mushy oversauced pasta, a dry chicken breast, and an oily pile of mixed greens.  The bread was greasy and seemed to have been sitting under the heat-lamp all day or else reheated in the microwave, as it was near impossible to tear or even cut with a knife. The water comes in a pretty artisan bottle but tastes like it was just (re)filled from a tap. Looks like this place has gone the way of every other eating establishment we have found safe eating at...that is, poor food, poor service, a dingy experience. 
The only thing that remains unchanges are the crayons on the table, though our waiter did not introduce himself, nor write his name on the table as they used to...not that I blame him, I wouldn't want to be known in association with this hole either. I will be waiting for them to show up on kitchen nightmares...If this was our experience from the dining-room, I really hate to see whats going on in the kitchen. We will not return."}
{"text":"I don't if there is way to give 0 start to this particular macarono grill location, before ordering Mushroom Ravioli, I asked waitress if this is totally vegetarian, she said yes. When she served, there was a big peice of chicken on top of it, i asked her what is it ? she say's it's just a big piece of rvaioli, i looked carefully with a fork, and it was chichken, she took it back, and brought a fresh one, and it tasted horrible.

I saw manager roaming around here and there, but he looked totally useless, no one came to apologize to us....

Waitress asked if we wanted more bread, we said yes, and that bread never came.....

I WILL NEVER EVER GO TO THIS MACARONI GRILL LOCATION, TOTAL RIP OFF"}
{"text":"Great food and service. I am NEVER dissatisfied with this place."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. 7 friends and multiple more got food poisoning last weekend. Channel 13 Dirty Dining investigated along with the Health District and also found no running hot water. Manager has done nothing and was nothing but rude when contacted."}
{"text":"We have been staying very near to this place for the past 5 months... How many times we thought of trying this one out.. Finally we did :) .. Food was pretty good.. Chicken parm was awesome ( highly recommended )... However there were very few servers around and the service was'nt great either.. Food was pretty good though.. I am a fan of this place :)"}
{"text":"12/2/11: 10 minutes after I ordered my lunch, server returns to tell me my dish is very popular and it's going to be 20 minutes and hands me the menu. If my meal isn't here within 20 minutes, they will lose another star.... just not worth giving them 3 stars"}
{"text":"My Daughter had her wedding reception here, just this past weekend. 
The staff answered all her questions and took care of everything we needed and helped her plan the reception. 
 The food was top notch, the service was the best I have ever had anywhere and the staff were both helpful and kind.  The prices were very reasonable and they even allowed us to bring in and store beforehand a cake for the reception. They did not charge us extra to serve the cake to the guests after the initial cut by the Bride and Groom.  
The staff put up the decorations that I had left with them for the occasion and even set up a couple of side tables for gifts. Even tho we were a bit late getting there, everything was served smoothly and every part of the dinner from the appetizers, to the salads to the Main courses and the drinks was delicious and all the guests were satisfied.
 We had vegetarian options for those in the party that wanted them. And the servers were kind enough to take direction to not serve those who did not drink alcohol sprite instead of Champagne for the toast.  It was a stress free reception and I could not thank them enough.  So, if you are looking for a place to hold a small reception of 50 or less people,Romano's is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant and waited almost 5 minutes before the hostess came over or anyone greeted us.  Then she asked if we were going to get the lunch special.  We tell her we're not sure because we haven't seen the menu.  Then she tells us that if we want the lunch special there's different seating so we have to decide before we sit down?! Ummmmm... what if somebody wants the lunch special and the other person doesn't??  Can we sit down and look at the menu before deciding? This has to be the stupidest policy/promotion ever!!! This was my first time back to Macaroni Grill in over a year, and I will not be returning anytime soon after this.  We decided to just leave and go to Chili's next door (which was great!)"}
{"text":"Service, what service?  Sat for 20 minutes with out even a hello or glass of water.  Asked the host 15 minutes into the wait if the place was \"self service\". She responded with let me check on your server, then walked to the bar area and chatted with someone for another 5 minutes.  We walked out at that point.."}
{"text":"Sat down and ordered a drink. Drink came. Olive oil came. No bread. Waiting 14 minutes for waiter to come back and take order. He didnt. It wasnt even busy. He was up at the front on the phone. I left $10 on the table and walked out in disgust."}
{"text":"I truly hate to write this but it might be helpful to management.  I have loved this restaurant chain for many years, first in Northern California and then when we moved to North Phoenix.  I've eaten at this location many times in the past always with excellent meals and service.  However, my husband isn't too keen on Italian food so it's been quite awhile since I had enjoyed my favorite Penne Rustica.  On August 19th, hubby was out of town so I decided to treat myself and  I ordered pick up.  The server Jordan was very sweet and had my food all neatly packaged up and ready to go.  When I got home, the food was still warm, so all good so far.  And then, much to my disappointment, the creamy sauced pasta with succulent shrimp and chicken I was expecting was dry dry dry.   There was seriously hardly any sauce at all and the chicken and shrimp were tough.   I couldn't even eat half of it-- was so dry.  SO very disappointing.  Don't know why the huge drop in quality, especially for the price, but I would have to think very seriously about returning.  Again, so very sad."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Got the Parmesan crusted chicken salad, awful!  Chicken was so thin and had no taste.  Felt bad because I split the salad with my girlfriend and she only had a few bites.  Lettuce did not seem fresh.  Will not be back.  The place was not busy during the peak of lunch hour which now makes sense."}
{"text":"You get a decent plate of food for the price.  Granted, there are a few tastier Italian restaurants out there, but not in this price range. The house wine is good and inexpensive and the homemade bread is excellent."}
{"text":"If you see my rating do not be under the impression that I disagree with Renee P. However, I must say that there were quite a few good experiences at this place that compensated for the broccoli side-dish that never arrived.

The 20 minute wait during the peak dinner hour was spent in observing the flurry of activity in the kitchen. They have an open kitchen floor-plan that keeps the restaurant abuzz. 

I have to mention Keith in this review, the recent import from New York who is still getting used to the lack of public transport in Phoenix. He along with his fellow waiting-staff members seemed to be full of good cheer. In fact one even sang a little Italian opera for the birthday girl at the next table.

They started us off with Tuscan bread and Italian butter (olive oil, ground pepper and parmesan cheese). The Penne Rustica was average but the Chianti Steak was absolutely delectable. For dessert the Italian sorbetto is a must try. 

I'm certainly going back for the other stuff that looked interesting on the menu. I hope I get my broccoli side the next time I am around."}
{"text":"Scott, was our server and he was AMAZING!  Great attitude and service.  We will be sure to ask for him again!
The food was nice and the chefs were sweet to automatically split the plate we were going to share. The manager stopped by to make sure we were well. It was a most pleasurable visit!"}
{"text":"I had to give this place one star, because we've been to other Macaroni Grills, and they were MUCH better.  Service was below average, but the food is what makes this place stand out in a bad way.  Maybe other reviewers have never eaten real Italian food?  Or maybe we just had a bad experience, because I can't understand giving this place a good review.  Both of our dishes were sitting in a tepid pool of oily fat.  The food tasted like fat, salt and butter.  Not very appetizing."}
{"text":"Used to be our favorite restaurant. The menu has changed drastically and the Make-Your-Own pasta meal is way too limited now. Service has gotten very poor since the old manager Mike has left. I have even written their corporate office to state our unhappiness with the direction of this restaurant. Very sad! Better off going to the Olive Garden for fast Italian food. Of course for top notch Italian just go to Little Italy."}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on the gluten free menu. After being told the wait for Harry Buffalo was over an hour, my friend and I decided to try across the street at Romano's Macaroni Grill since they were the only restaurant nearby that didn't have a wait. In fact, the place had maybe 3 other tables with people that night. At any rate, after looking at the menu online and ascertaining that they had a gluten free menu, I decided I was hungry enough to roll the dice and give this place a try. In hindsight, I shouldn't have let my stomach do the thinking for me, and instead, just waited it out at Harry Buffalo. But back to my review. Yes, there is a gluten free menu, but if you  are eating gluten free like I am for Celiacs or other health reasons, you should probably avoid this place. I did my usual speech with the waitstaff, \"I have celiacs...gluten free...prepared separately...blah blah.\" Everything is going pretty smoothly. Then then bread starts coming out for my friend. It was a lot of warm, freshly baked bread. But I soldiered on with my Bibb and Blue without crispy onions, and it was a great salad. So far, so good, I was starting to feeling happy and confident. Then came my Fettuccine Alfredo with gluten free penne. Why did I have to order the pasta? Cross contamination in a kitchen that literally has macaroni in the name should probably have been expected. I knew pretty much by the end of our stay that something somewhere had gone wrong. So yeah, I wasn't surprised when I spent the rest of the night sick. If you need to eat gluten free, I would recommend giving this place a pass. There is just too much opportunity for cross contamination. Your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We were seated and drinks ordered at 5:15pm by 6:40pm the only think I had received was bread and my alcoholic beverage. Was in the area for my son's football game and couldn't even get the check fast enough to make it to the game on time.  Very disappointed.  
It wasn't even busy.  :("}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I have been to Macaroni Grills in other parts of the country, and have always had a good experience. What a letdown this location turned out to be! My husband and I decided to try the \"Two for Twenty-Five\" promotion (you choose 2 tapas and two entrees from a limited menu fro $25). When we arrived, it took a few minutes for the staff to acknowledge us. Not a good sign! We were seated behind a family whose children proceeded to sing, hum, yell and kick the back of the booth (not the restaurant's fault, but highly annoying). The waiter immediately told us that the kitchen was out of one of the tapas we had planned on ordering. We made another choice and proceeded to order our main courses, also. Ten minutes later, our waiter returned to inform us that the kitchen \"just\" ran out of the entree I'd chosen. Grrrrr! Again, I made another selection. Our food arrived, and my husband's chicken milanese was barely edible. The chicken had been pounded and flattened so much that it took up the entire plate! You could almost read a newspaper through it...or use it as a frisbee (your choice!). It was tough as nails, and the only flavor it had was that of the grease it was cooked in. My second choice entree- chicken caprese- was super bland, but cooked well. We agreed that the simple pomodoro that was served with my dinner and the roasted potatoes accompanying my husband's were far better than the actual entrees. The area we were seated in was close to the back, so we were treated to the staff yelling at each other across the dining area at random intervals. There was no shift manager in sight, at least none who cared enough to come by our table and ask how everything was. Needless to say, we WON'T be back to this location."}
{"text":"Food quality ranges from good to bad. 
Bad: 
1) terrible tomato sauces for pasta --overly greasy and too garlicky (and I love garlic and olive oil). 
2) Cheap flavorless olive oil and wimpy balsamic vinegar (this one is more forgiveable than the first item). 
3) Overcooked lamb. 
4) Burnt black pizza crust. Soggy pizza crust. Poorly distributed stuff on pizza (with really large areas of bread \"desert.\" 
5) Three \"make your own pastas\" were ordered and two were made with wrong combinations. 
6) Overwhelmed manager. 
7) Icky tasting ice.
Good: 
1) lemon dessert (really, really good), 
2) chocolate dessert, 
3) red snapper fish dish, 
4) cream pastas in general, 
5) room with fireplace has nice atmosphere.
6) nice waitstaff. 
Meh: 
1) salads. 
2) Only have Diet Coke --not Coke Zero. 
3) Margherita pizza....nice elements, but soggy crust and inadequate basil.
Bottom line: I wouldn't go back here by choice, but if I go again, I will probably order a fish dish. The cream pastas are tasty, but not really a healthy choice.
Portions are smaller as other writers have noted. This is probably better for the American diet in general, but makes for disappointing leftovers.
We were a large group...not sure if that is why so much of our order was messed up by kitchen..."}
{"text":"Took the family here on Easter Sunday and could not have been more disappointed in the quality and quantity of the meals everyone had.  My whole grain pasta with chicken and brocolini had a whopping 4 thinly sliced pieces of chicken and 3 little green stems that appeared to be a vegetable.  When I asked the waitress where the rest of the chicken was she got the manager.  She told me that the order called for 3 ounces of chicken and 5 pieces of brocolini.  I did find the other 2 pieces of stemmy green stuff under the pile of undercooked cold pasta.  They did bring me more chicken and in the end she did comp the dish, but it was too late.  My daughters lobster ravioli (3 pieces!) was OK but she was done in about 2 minutes and asking for more bread...my wifes lasagna was \"OK\" by her standards but in all honesty, I've never seen her eat and entire meal without having leftovers.  Portion size was small...and finally, my son ate spaghetti and meatballs (1/2 of it).  When the waitress brought a carryhome box, he said that he wouldn't eat it for lunch.  Apparently, he didn't like it and didn't want to tell me because he could see how frusterated I was.  The waitress did a good job and tried to help out...it was not her fault the meal was horrible.  I tipped her 20% on the entire bill before the compped dish I had.

I'll never go back.

{"text":"I realize that this is a chain but I think all of the Italian restaurants over in this plaza are. In any event despite that and rather in contrast to Oreganos I have always gotten really great service here. I really like the $10 three course lunch special. Which is certainly not as fancy as it sounds but I like having starters and a salad with my entree which would be too much food and out of my lunch budget at other places. So 5 stars on customer service and the lunch special, minus 1 because a couple of dishes I've tried were too greasy or a disappointing flavor combination On that; there is a jalapeño one in the appetizer section that I thought I would love which is awful, don't get that one. Also the mushroom ravioli is very good but definitely towards the oily side and would be much better with a lighter touch."}
{"text":"The worst, tasteless food I ever ate.  I will never go back.  We spoke to the manager and she said maybe the cooks should add more salt and pepper. Trust me, that wouldn't help."}
{"text":"Took a group here for my daughters graduation dinner. Had superior service from Alex or possibly Alec. Our orders were taken promptly, the half price wine was suggested. Amazing Rosemary and salt bread was fantastic. 7 of us ate and drank our fill with left overs and wine to take home for $144."}
{"text":"Thank you to the staff tonight for being so gracious and hospitable! Everyone is kind and smiling! And the food is great!!! If you are lucky, Waitress Shelly will sing a beautiful Italian song!!! We will be back soon for more lasagna...YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I do not understand why this place is rated so low.. I am extremely critical when reviewing places and this place was AMAZING. Our waitress was Natalie.. She was I think the best waitress I've ever had. You can tell she loves her job (or at least pretended really well.) she asked if we were in a hurry from the start... I'm pregnant and tired.. She didn't drag on her speech. She was fast. Never an empty drink. Just an all around amazing experience! And the food was awesome. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the sampler... so much food! I didn't even touch my lasagna but it made wonderful leftovers when I heated it up the next day. Our sever was funny and friendly and the food was great. I will happily be returning."}
{"text":"We decided to go and eat dinner here at 4:30pm, last night 01/12/18 .It wasn't that busy.  It took forever for the waitress/bartender to come and get our drinks/meal order...and that pattern went through out the whole meal.  They mixed up our meals with 2 other tables.  My husband complained to the manager.  His reply was \"We made you new got plates\" No apologies was made there after, but the table next to our who got their meals mixed up got an apologies from the chef.  Lots of help but this poor girl who was serving us was going crazy trying to keep up. We finished our meal at 5:30pm. It's was a nightmare!!  Everybody who came after us got their meal before us. Service is always bad at this location and we have been here more than once.  What's sad is there are so many other restaurants on Stephanie that we could of patronized and service would of been way better.  You think they would go above and beyond to try and keep us as regulars."}

{"text":"Ok super HORRIBLE SERVICE!  I hadn't experience this bad of a service so this is one of the reasons why I got a yelp account! My girl friend and I were running errands, we got hungry and since we was close to dessert ridge we went there to find a place to eat. We came across Romanos and decided to go here for and early dinner, since we had skipped lunch. We loved the place and their lights, it looks \"romantic\" was what my friend said as we walked in.  And here is where it all went to hell!
1) there's a man at the hostess podium discussing something with a waitresses, we are there in front of them and we don't even get a \" hello, or welcome be with you shortly\" i new he seem busy but at least acknowledge us.
2)finally a waitress or hostess comes greed us and just says \"two\" i say yes and she just walls we a assume we have to fallow, she finds this waiter starts chasing with him and then she drops the menus on the table. Not even a \" here have a seat,  or recommendations of what's good there\" just drops the menu,  my friend lips at me and smiles, and tells \" maybe jeans and a t-shirt aren't a good attire to wear here \".
3)we sat in the table for a good 15min and nothing, nobody came to say,  if we were ok,  I f we were ready to order,  or absolutely nothing! 
4)I got impatient but I was also astonish at their service that I wanted to see how long will they ignore us. I started to drop hints wherever a waiter or waitress pass by like \"Are you serious 15min and not even water\" or I guess we are invisible\"  and \"nobody seems to see us\". My friend got upset and walk out, I hear to fallow her. But we were ignore for about 20-25 min.  And not even when we walk out we where notice. 

I do not know if they had a more dressy dress code,  if maybe they are prejudice because we were two women,  or because we were young or because we are Latinas. This by far was the worse service experience of my life!  I do not want to go back,  but my friend does so we will probably try it again and maybe go not looking so casualand hopefully we get better service. Or maybe try a different location, since the setting and decor was nice, maybe at a different location they will acknowledge us."}
{"text":"REALLY good chicken Marsala. Like my mouth waters just thinking about it. I also loved the ambiance and atmosphere n service. Came with my aunt sister and baby and they were able to accommodate us and give us a private area. I took a couple stars off cause the tiramisu looked a little hard and old  and very unfresh at the corners of the plate. That's not acceptable in any case."}
{"text":"Joey Z and the rest of the crew at this location was fantastic. We had a reservation for 15 and had to increase it to 21 within 30 minutes of arrival. They were so accommodating and Joey Z handled our 18 16-year old boys with ease, was pleasant and served us flawlessly. I'm so grateful."}
{"text":"this macaroni grill location has been closed down. i worked for the company for a few years and most of the staff knew it was coming. a menu overhaul and an AWESOME new general manager came in a few months before the close, which made me have a little hope; however it seems that word had gotten out that the ahwatukee location wasn't particularly great.
there are plenty of other valley locations that seem to have quite a high volume of customers; arrowhead, mesa, and golddust (scottsdale). i would have loved to transfer but too much of a drive for me!
the spaghetti bolognese will always be my favorite. if they ever bring back the panna cotta, be sure to try it!"}
{"text":"I was here with my husband, and this place was a joke. The table covers were paper, and our waitress was strange, and wrote her name on our table with crayon. Very unsanitary, and we felt like we were at Chucky Cheese. The kitchen staff kept fighting with each other, for everyone to hear, and the food was poorly executed.  The wait staff couldn't even give a wine recommendation, the manager had to come over and give us one. Truly disappointing.
We will not be back, and We will tell all our friends to stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"After a movie at AMC, my mom, dad, aunt & I decided to have an early dinner here. I have been here a few times in the past but it's been a good 3-4 years since my last visit. I forgot that they have paper on the table so you can doodle on it. That's always fun. Our server was Dan & he was really friendly.

For starters we ordered the calamari, by we I mean my mom because she orders calamari whenever we go out. It was good & so was the dipping sauce. Their rosemary bread is tasty too, especially with a lil olive oil. My dad ordered red wine (not sure which 1) & I ordered the ultimate leaning bellini. Dad enjoyed his wine, had 3 glasses & I loved my cocktail, so yummy! For our entrees: my aunt-shrimp portifino, dad-aged beef tenderloin spiedini, mom-originally wanted lasagna but they were out for the next hour, ugh, so she settled for chicken scaloppine & myself-lobster ravioli. My aunt loved hers, dad liked his, mom didn't care for hers & kept eating off of our plates & I liked mine as well. 

Not sure how authentic their Italian is, but hey we overall enjoyed our dinner & would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with some of the comments here. My wife and I were unimpressed with this restaurant from the start. We arrived during the lull period between lunch and dinner and stood at the host stand for a few minutes with no response despite servers in the room. As we were about to leave a girl came in that was clearly getting ready to start her shift and sat us despite not being in uniform. Strike one. 

Our server took a few minutes to get to us for the first time and pushed the appetizer special pretty hard despite us not being interested in having one. After that it took over five minutes to get our drinks - a water and a Coke - despite having enough time to walk in the kitchen, back out, drop off bread, pick up dirty dishes from another table, then back into the kitchen. Strike two, although the rosemary bread is rather good. 

We decided to get some side items before the meal since we were a little hungry. I ordered a bowl of soup and my wife got a side Caesar salad that we requested before the entrees. The salad was pretty dry, requiring her to order a side of dressing from the manager that was walking around since the server didn't follow up. My soup portion was extremely small - one layer and almost no broth. Unacceptable for a five dollar bowl. Strike three. 

At this point we had maybe a few bites down and the entrees came out. I had the chicken marsala which was about average, though not as tender as it should be. She had fettuccine alfredo with chicken, also average. The portion size for both meals was about normal. 

Overall our experience was very subpar, despite the friendly nature of all staff members we encountered. I can't recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for anything more than an average chain Italian experience."}
{"text":"Walked in at 8 on a Friday night.  The place was half empty, open tables in full view and we were told the wait would be 15 - 20 minutes. We must have appeared baffled as we looked around at the abundance of available seating and were told they were \"re-setting\".  That must be industry lingo for \"we have no intention of waiting on you.\" It smelled good & we were in the mood for Italian, so we went into the bar (two couples at tables but otherwise empty).  We sat down and anticipated a friendly bartender but instead watched four different employees come behind the bar and without even a glance in our direction, turn right around & walk back out. I will never try this place again and will be sure to tell everyone I know. I signed up for Yelp just to share this ridiculous experience."}
{"text":"We went to Macaroni Grill a couple weeks ago and were extremely disappointed with pretty much everything about the experience. The service was slow at best on a not very busy night. The food did not taste fresh at all, in fact tasted as if it had been cooked two days prior and just nuked in the microwave. My wife ordered what our waitress said was the \"best item on the menu\" and it was quite tasteless. I had the Italian trio sampler which was bland. We will undoubtedly never go there again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and was very disappointed. Waited 40 minutes for our entrees, the service was terrible. It seemed as though all of the employees were extremely flustered (it was not busy) and did not want to be there at all.  To make matters worse, the food was awful! I've been to other Romano's and they were MUCH MUCH better than this!!"}
{"text":"For about 10+ years my family has gone to macaroni grill often and for special occasions like birthdays. Over the last 2 to 3 years the restaurant has been in a steady decline in terms of quality. Our most recent and last visit included the new \"half pound meatball dishes\" which ended up absolutely nothing like the picture for the TV advertisement. First, the pound of food was about 4 ounces of meatball and 12 ounces of pasta. Second, the pasta lacked flavor and in my case only had a few pieces of sliced mushroom. Everyone at our table was not happy with their meal after having given the restaurant tour three visit chances. The bread is still good, the key on today is good and the waitstaff continue to be relatively decent. Unfortunately, this is the last time and there are other similar options whereby the food is much better and they seem to care more."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had to ask for refills. Waitress disappeared. Had to ask someone to find her. Food quality has diminished from what it was. Thought I would try them again. Not coming back. What a shame. It used to be a great restaurant."}
{"text":"This was basically disgusting.  My parents used to love Macaroni Grille for some reason, so I used to go there with them once in a while, and usually order the Eggplant Parm, as they don't have many vegetarian options.  The eggplant was usually ok, even if the sauce was basically just chunky salsa (which I hate). However, on the last occasion I went, they were out of eggplant, sue to some weird shortage (fair enough, probably not their fault) so I opted for the make your own pasta.  I selected roasted garlic, sundried tomatoes, and mozzarella.  We were then left sitting, without any bread or drinks, for about half an hour, when we had to beg a passing server to bring us some.  When I finally received my iced tea, it was hot!  Clearly, someone had just iced down hot tea.  I mean, I understand this is how iced tea is made, but usually it's chilled in advance.  I'm sure way more people order tea iced than hot at this sort of establishment, especially if the tea in question is blackberry flavored.  When the pasta finally arrived, it was straight up revolting.  The pasta had been so overcooked that it was disintegrating, and it appeared to be topped with nothing but cheese and lots and lots of roasted red peppers, which I had definitely not asked for.  I forced down a tiny bit, but left most of it, and refused a take home bag when offered.  The server never questioned how my meal was, despite the fact that most of it was on the plate.  Besides this, she never brought us any more bread besides the first loaf we had to track down ourselves, so I wasn't even able to fill up on that.  This place is the worst, possibly even grosser than Olive Garden (and I got violently ill the last time I ate there, so that's really saying something). I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Lynn was waitress.  Didn't ask if we wanted more bread (4 adults).  Had to ask for drink refill.  Parmesan crusted chicken salad should have never been delivered to customer.  Chicken was so dark looked next almost burned, let alone terribly dry.  Was not busy!  Not going back!"}
{"text":"I use to love Macaroni Grill until now, our waiter was extremely rude. Seemed like he was rushing us to order and leave. I literally placed my fork down for one second and he asked me if he can box up my food already after its been 3 mins since he brought it out for us...ugh I wasn't done eating but sure I don't even want to eat anymore....We couldn't even drink the water he had bought out, you could clearly see white things just floating all over the vase it was disgusting."}
{"text":"Went here with a group (35-40 people) for which there was a reservation.  They had set aside a separate area for us.  Two waitresses handled this and didn't necessarily divide the groups by tables.  One waitress got all of her orders out promptly.  The rest of us were stuck waiting about an hour from when our orders were placed.  Most of us had ordered before the people who were served first.

When I asked if our food was coming soon I didn't get much of a response.  When someone else asked about the inconsistency, she got the run around.  No accommodation or sincere apology for this abysmal service.

Yes, the food was good when we finally got it.  No, it wasn't good enough to make up for the poor service."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience.  6pm Saturday not busy. Sat in bar area one other couple there they had waited 20 minutes for there check. Turns out bar tender is in restaurant serving tables. We waited and waited. Got up got our own menus and waited. Then we left. Oh so baf"}
{"text":"Went back to this Mac Grill on July 28 for late lunch to see how things are going with the chain's new ownership (Joe's Crab shack parent Ignite versus prior Golden Gate venture firm who was frankly disinterested).  Spent a lot of time talking to Deonne one of the new managers. She and lead manager Renee are highly experienced and dedicated to turn this location's reputation around.  Many (perhaps total) new staff.  There is a different (positive) vibe and these managers want to know if something doesn't meet customer's satisfaction.  A new district manager for all AZ locations is also arriving soon.

Our food was well prepared, large portions, and the service was attentive.  Manager was making the rounds, not hiding somewhere.  Benefited from a buy one, get one entrée special and the half price wine promotion.

There's a revised menu coming mid-August to improve quality and restore some favorites.  I'm told it will be high quality items at affordable prices.

So for those who enjoyed eating here in years past, but became disappointed since 2008, it's time to give it another try.  But if something isn't to your liking, find the manager and speak up right then and there."}
{"text":"Our waitress was amazing and Culinary Manager Tim Kahley was an outstanding professional! We had some issues with our food and they were on top of it and went above and beyond to correct things. I could not be more grateful to them, I give them both 5 stars. I feel so bad I cannot remember our waitresses name, she had short blond hair and was very friendly and upbeat. Tim Kahley is an outstanding manager! They both deserve a raise!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews, we had such excellent service from everyone. We were picky customers from the beginning and all our requests were met, even though the place was extremely busy. They let us choose a large booth instead of a single booth so my partner and I could sit together and no we didn't want a table. Our waitress, Karent (yes with a t, first time for me), was superb. Very friendly and accommodating. Ask for her by name. Yes, they did mess up on my partner's meal and the wrong plate was brought to us, but they were so quick to fix it and so apologetic, we couldn't hold it against them. The food was delicious, the desserts fantastic and the house chianti went perfectly with the tiramisu. Overall, an outstanding experience and we will return!"}
{"text":"Romanos Macaroni Grill on Scottsdale Rd & Gold Dust in Scottsdale AZ
This is my favorite restaurant for many reasons.  Great food, very consistent, reasonable prices and good happy hour times.  But, by far my favorite is Trevor.....bartender/server.  I am always happy to sit in the bar, when he is stationed there.  He is by far, the best server ever.  He makes the best tasting martinis, is always aware of his customers and treats everyone with a great ATTITUDE, and perfect service.  We all know that a server can make or break our evening, and in turn can make or break the decision to return (in my case, over and over).  My friends love him too.  In addition, this particular Macaroni Grill has the best tasting food, and I have tried most dishes.....my personal favorites,  chicken scallopini, an appetizer made with mozzarella and procchuto.  (If only I could spell in Italian)  Their happy hour margarita pizza is delicious.....and what a bargain with a glass of house wine.....total, under $10.  Ask for Trevor to serve you, as everything will be even better!  Enjoy!  Joanne Brooks"}
{"text":"This place used to be so good years ago.  We haven't been there in a really long time and decided to go tonight for dinner.  It took 30 minutes to get our food and when they brought us our dinner, it was laughable.  Both, mine and my husband dinner looked pathetic.  I never send my food back and I can't remember a time that I ever complain about my meal at a restaurant, but this I could not handle.  I never even tried my food.  It looked  gross.  I sent it back and didn't and didn't order anything else since I knew it would take forever to get another plate of food.  I ate some of my husbands rubbery, fatty steak, which was gross as well.  We will never dine here again.  On a positive note, our server was good and nice as well."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome price, awesome service. Apparently they're working on revamping the restaurant, bringing in some new staff, and bringing this Macaroni Grille back to where it should be. I talked to the manager for a bit, and he mentioned this location as an awesome spot being in Scottsdale and an opportunity to provide a great experience to customers. Looking forward to coming back many more times!"}
{"text":"I thought my dinner was delicious today! I had the eggplant quadratini! It was so good and flavorful. When the food came out however it was just warm. I would have liked to have my dinner a lot warmer. For dessert I had the lemon passion fruit cake. It was absolutely yummy. I also had a cup of illy coffee which is always good! Overall a great night with my boyfriend!"}
{"text":"Had some pasta with shrimps and had the worst case of food poisoning I ever had.I never went back."}
{"text":"Yesterday I took my girlfriend here on a date. Immediately upon entering we were greeted by several members of the staff including our server Jeanette (I believe she may be a manager as well). I was completely impressed that it was not even ten seconds from entering that we were greeted by the staff! We were immediately seated by Jeanette and were given menus and asked for our drinks. She wrote her name down on the table and I was even impressed with how well she wrote her name upside down. I ordered the Italian mojito and my girlfriend ordered another mixed drink as well. The drinks were made by Jeanette in fast and accurate manner with a clean presentation. I ordered the lobster ravioli and my girlfriend ordered the penne (I forgot what the whole name of the entree was). The food came out quick! The food was well prepared, fresh, and accurate. I was amazed on how well the food came out, it could have been a picture for an advertisement! Not one time during our meal we were forgotten and our drinks and to go box were taken care of. I will be calling Macaroni Grille's corporate number - the service there was above and beyond what I have expected and should be recognized."}
{"text":"BEWARE,  SLOW SAT. NIGHT SERVICE +  THEY ADD ON EXTRA FOR THE TIP AMOUNT.

We went to this particular location on 9/21/2013 for my wife's birthday dinner.  I have been in other Romano's Macaroni Grill so I expected the same things (LOVE THE STUFFED MUSHROOMS).  Instead what we got was EXTREMELY SLOW service and I mean SLOW.  That and OH YEAH. Instead of the 12$ tip that i put in (123.78 without tip balance) They charged me an overall of 144.78$ THEY ADDED 9 $ extra to their slow moving selves.  (Just filed a claim with BOA to get this reversed.)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, friendly server. Although the food I think is served from frozen. I ordered mama trio. The two of three items were great. Plate came out hot, couldn't touch it. Went to eat lasagna and was ice cold in the center, nit even warm. 
The server apologized about it offered new one or reheat this one. I chose a new one to go. I saw her go tell manager. The manager didn't even come over and say anything. I was not even acknowledged on my way out and walked past 3 people. I will not be going back. Over priced for frozen food."}
{"text":"Kristen the manager is awesome!! 
she took care of us. She made our experience better,  and willing to come back."}
{"text":"I was super excited to go to this place because I've never been here. However walking in the hostess was very short coming off very rude. Keep in mind it was only like four or five in the afternoon. When we sat down the place was coming off cheap. Paper on the tables poor lighting. Not to mention we waited ten minutes just to get water! We ordered apps and y hose came out before the bread. The apps were zucchini and we're so thin and burnt was not worth the 9 dollars. And the mac and cheese that were okay but nothing special. We were never waited on by a waiter but the fricking bartender. It's wrong to have six customers two being children at the bar. And two tables from us was being waiting on by a chef. I will not being going back just because of how everything was. The only thing that was good or decent was the pasta but never again."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, what a disaster!  My husband called in an order and asked me to pick it up on my way home.  I arrived and went to the pick-up area where there were 3 other people in front of me.  No big deal, right?  Well, after about 30 minutes, the woman in line just ahead of me was told that they did not have her order that was phoned in about an hour earlier.  So, she placed another order and sat down to wait.  

Finally, after about 45 minutes in line, I make it to the cashier, and after giving him my name and what was ordered, he proceeds to tell me that they do not have the order!  Thinking that my name could have been mis-spelled or taken down incorrectly, I asked him if there was an identical order under a similar name.  Instead of checking, the employee looks at me and asks, \"Are you asking me to give you someone else's food?\"  Unbelievable!  Then he asks me if I want to place an order to go!  After witnessing what was happening in the kitchen during my 45 minute wait, I'm sure that I would have had another hour or more to wait for my order to be completed!  The kitchen that was utterly chaotic.  Absolutely no organization by the chef (who was shouting out orders to anyone who would listen, but no one in particular)!  The kitchen was piled high with dirty pans everywhere.  It's a wonder they got any orders out.  

Had the cashier not accused me of asking him to give me another person's food, I may have considered returning to this restaurant.  However, after that treatment, and what I witnessed in the kitchen, I can say with confidence that I will NEVER set foot in this place again!"}
{"text":"I took 7 friends to my favorite local Italian restaurant yesterday. I've always felt that Macaroni Grill is fast to accommodate a medium size group. They were! We got seated with no wait. I come to this restaurant about 3 times a month. This time, I ordered one of my favorites: Margarita Pizza. What a surprise it was when it came to the table. The chef has a new recipe -- you take a frozen pizza out of the freezer, you throw it in the oven, you wait just enough time for the crust to thaw into dough, and you send the abomination to the table.

What happened to the real thing? Where is the flat crispy crust with fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and whole fresh basil leaves? Where is my Margarita Pizza?

I will miss you good old dish for you are now nothing but a wish. BOOOO to the new chef and forever goodbye to Macaroni Grill.

Update 8/2017

The food gets worse and worse. Prediction: not too long now. Can you say \"chapter 11\"?"}
{"text":"The bread was yummy and crusty. The food was good but a bit pricey. The waitstaff were quick and efficient. Plus they let us in 5 minutes before they actually opened. Good experience!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at this particular restaurant  a couple of times and although I have enjoyed my meal the service has never been very good. Ate there again last night and we were a party of five. Service was beyond poor.  Wrong orders came to the table and my entree which was a create your own pasta was stone cold. It sat on the counter waiting for other meals to be plated for at least 20 minutes and not under warming lights.  It took at least twenty minutes for cocktails to arrive. Called manager over and instead of trying to appease us he merely seemed irritated. There was absolutely no excuse for this poor service...restaurant wasn't even at 20% of it's capacity. As we walked out another customer was yelling at manager about fact his party had been waiting for one hour for their food. We will not return"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with 4 others and had another bad experience at the Macaroni Grill.  When will we ever learn?  The server was not only inattentive, but p o'd when we asked to be moved to another table.  When the food came it was at best, luke warm.  They had run out of one of our ordered dishes, but didn't inform us until 20 minutes after we had ordered.  Running out at 6:00 p.m.: Really? More delay and no apologies. There is no excuse for a cold meal and poor service.  We will not go back since the Grill seems not to care and there are plenty of other restaurants which do."}
{"text":"Went here as a choice of the in-laws. Hadn't been to a Macaroni Grill in a few years, and was actually looking forward to it as my past experiences (although never at this location) were very good. When we were seated they tried to put us in the first table just outside of the main path back to the kitchen, even though the place was practically empty (it was a Tues evening). When we asked to move out of the main traffic area, they offered a table one spot away from the original one. OK, we'll play your silly game, let's not address the 800 lb gorilla in the room (the 85% empty restaurant). Once seated our server stopped by very quickly to get drink orders and apps.  Before the app came out, our server was back to take our dinner order (so far, so good, right? Ahhhh, just wait). We ordered: Lasagna w/side salad, Capellini with meat sauce, Eggplant Parmesan  with a side of sausage, and a Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad.  The side salad came out not long after the app, and then the wait began. Not sure how long, but it was long enough for the entire table to get antsy and for us to ask for more bread. We even joked that it was because someone ordered lasagna.  When the main courses came out, take a guess which one didn't come out with them...you ready? The Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad. Seriously. The rest of the table started eating (it can't be that far behind, right?) and no kidding, they were at least halfway through their main course when they brought out a salad with what looked like a half of a chicken tender chopped up in it. I thought maybe they had tossed it in or something, and when I confirmed the few small pieces were all that was there, it went from not so good to bad (and soon to really bad...wait for it...).

So, here I sat with this sad salad with a couple pieces of chicken, and because the wait had been so long, I was done. I told the server I didn't want it anymore and to send it back. Then I told her to make sure her manager saw what was coming out of the kitchen. I saw her talk to the manager and she came back and said they were going to make some more chicken. I told her that I didn't want it at all. I saw her go talk to the manager, who was at this point standing in front of the girl making salads) and I know by her body language and his that she told him I didn't want it at all. A few minutes later I saw them put more chicken on the salad, put some more dressing on it, and he started walking over. When he got to the table I was PISSED (yeah, really). I asked him what part of \"I don't want it\" did he not understand and he just stood there hovering over me with this damn salad in his hands. I explained everything that had happened and he told me that the server never told him that I didn't want it at all. He asked if there was anything he could do and I said \"Yes, you can go away\" (he was still just standing there staring at me like he could use the Force to make me take the salad.

Now, you might be thinking, \"Damn, little harsh Bro!\" Ah yeah, but wait til you hear what sent me over the top...

When our server came back (who was very nice and apologetic this entire time) I asked her if she told him that I didn't want the salad at all, no matter how much chicken they put on it, she said (and I fully believe her) \"Yes, I told him that\". So I told her how he lied to me and threw her under the bus. THAT is just inexcusable. Forget to put an order in, fine. Something not cooked right, oopps.  Throw one of your workers under the bus? Piss poor.

Oh yeah, and the app we ordered was zucchini hold the cheese, and it came with cheese, and the side of sausage never came out.

Would I ever go there again? Not a chance. At this point I don't know when I'll even risk going to another Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"Okay, so it's been a little while since I've been to the macaroni grill and I tell ya, I'm more disappointed in it now then in past times! I love Italian, but when you have a spaghetti and meatball dish and they run out of meatballs that's just a little sad! Then when you substitute with italian sausages and they are over cooked.. You know something is not right! Oh, but wait, there's more!!! The shrimp was over cooked and the sea bass I had was really over cooked and lacked flavor! What makes this bad, IT WAS ONLY LUNCH!!! Don't get it twisted, it was no late lunch, it was a 12:00pm, I would consider, early lunch! Geez!!! So, we took a chance and had desert, Cheesecake, well that too was disappointing! The strawberry goo looked every bit the part! The only way we knew it was strawberry was the pieces that weren't quite obliterated! Sad sad sad! Okay, that was the negative part... As for the good parts. The crayons for drawing kept us happy until the food showed up. The wine was quite tasty and the water was equally good!!! Oh, our server was cool too! Now would I go back for lunch or any other meal? Probably not!!! 
So why the 3 stars?? Well, like I said the wine, water and server were good and that's worth 2 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a while so I came back to check it out. That was definitely a mistake...
It took us 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by a waiter after we were seated. Both the appetizers and the food took forever to come out and when they did were tasteless and awful. The restaurant wasn't that crowded, yet the service was slow and when I asked my waiter for parmesan cheese, it never came. The portions of pasta were small considering the expensive price. Thankfully, they didn't charge my friend twice when she didn't like her food the first time. 
I would not recommend this restaurant and suggest you stay far away."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on Tuesday and sat up at the bar around 4:30  and had Matt as our bartender. He was great! We had a free tapas coupon and he was more than accommodating (too many servers/bartenders neglect you once you say you have a coupon). He gave us honest recommendations and was quite personable. Our appetizer ended up being overcooked so he had the kitchen make us a new one without even having us ask for a new one. Good lookin out on the quality control! Our dinnners were good and we took most of it to go because we were full on the tapas and the hot bread. We will defintiely go back just because of Matt. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Just got done eating. Ordered pasta rustica and caprese salad. The salad was so small and they charged $9.50, rip off! The pasta rustica apparently was given to someone else, so had to wait longer, and then it was a little burnt on the top. Then they charged me for two iced teas and we only orders one. The server was not that good, didn't bring out bread, I had to ask for it. I'm going back now to complain, and I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Not as nice as I remember....my last experience had improperly made lasagna, was super hot outside and next to frozen cold in the center. Great customer service. Great bread! Kid friendly."}
{"text":"I don't understand why the reviews are so bad. We dined at this location last night. My husband had a chicken and pasta plate while my kids had pasta dinners. Our server, Richard, did an exceptional job. He was attentive and made sure our appetizer was delivered to our table in a timely manner. He also made sure the kids had enough drinks and was very helpful with any questions we had. The food was great and so was the service. I have to rave about the wine...yum, yum!! I actually had a second glass with dessert. So sad to know that people are overly critical about everything nowadays. I can't believe some of these reviews...why go out to eat just to write a bad review?? Wah, wah, wah...If you don't like it, don't go back. But as for us, we have been here several times since this place opened and will continue to eat here. Not once have we had a negative experience."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Macaroni Grille location for many years and it seems that over time it just keeps getting worse.  They are constantly out of signature items and the service has been dismal of late.  Most of servers are nice and friendly but they are constantly understaffed.  It seems as if the managers like to have as few staff as necessary on hand, so when it gets busy, the customers suffer.  I will look for better options in the west valley if they don't change this practice SOON!  If it wasn't for the delicious Penne Rustica, I would have probably stopped going already."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight, started with a bowl of cold mushroom soup that tasted like the cook dropped the pepper mill into the soup. Then had a chicken Caesar salad.  I should have asked for the dressing on the side, not because they put alot on it, because I don't think they put any on it. 

Hope served us and she was the only reason I gave this nights experience 2 stars"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I ever had. 
Waited forever to place my order. 
Had to order the soup two times. 
The appetizer came after we finished our main dish. 
No soap in men's room. 

Not to mention that none of the ordered dishes tasted good. 

We ended up eating their lovely bread with olive oil and balsamic."}
{"text":"The service was incredible Clarise was our waitress.

Food was also very good! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The new owners will be closing soon.
Food poor at best.
Slow service and very few folks eating.
It can not survive"}
{"text":"Four of us stopped in on a Sunday afternoon just before 4pm, the place was practically empty.  Two hours later we were finally able to leave!  Our server was new,  slow,  annoying and had the service ability of Dennys or Perkins, she had no business at this restaurant.  She brought or drinks and asked if there was anything else we needed,  we asked if we could order food... She laughed it off that she forgot,  that should have been or first red flag.  The food was good but two hours for lunch on a Sunday is ridiculous. We will not be back,  the manager or her trainer should have never let this happen."}
{"text":"I walked in and placed a takeout order,  I have never been to this restaurant before. Zena was my server and she immediately came to the podium and took my order. She was so pleasant and efficient. She brought me a drink while I waited. The line (kitchen) is open and visible from the dining room. The chef that was preparing the bruschetta looked very angry. The bruschetta was deconstructed and I put it together when I got to my room. It was delicious and very flavorful. The only negative thing about the bruschetta is that the tomatoes were cold. I also ordered eggplant parmesan, the flavor was good, but it was under cooked. I also received some bread that I did not eat."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here with my wife and three kids. We all got exactly what we wanted for only 30 bucks. Portions were perfect and the food tasted great. Waitress was great and very nice to all the kids. Very welcoming atmosphere. Nice and clean too which I value above all else. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Food was OK, service was good. But it was so hot We could not enjoy it. Server said its been hot for a few weeks. Sorry its in acceptable.  I will not go back to this location.  There is no reason for 83 degrees, yes 83 I looked at the thermistat set at 74 reading at 83.  If your AC is broke fix it if your store is 83 degrees close it until it is fixed.  My friends face was flushed because of the heat."}
{"text":"We stepped in this afternoon for dinner.  We should have known when we walked in and no one was happy to be there.  We were not greeted we were simply seated.  It was our first visit and we mentioned it to the waitress so she could recommend something.  but all we got was \"dead Air\" .  She came over 4 times in such a rush asking us if we were ready even before she bought our drinks which by the way today on this 112 degree day didnt get refilled after 2 requests. ( the ice tea was warm in melted ice.)  Geeze she brought our meal and never cared to come by to see if we needed anything more.  We ordered some appetizers since we wanted to taste different things and my son ordered the lobster raviolis which he said were delicious and my daughters pasta was just as delicious.  We would have loved to try more but it was hot and we felt like we were being burdensome.   My children dont give compliments very easily so I would have loved to try other things on the menu.  But I wouldnt spend my hard earned money on this place with such terrible  service."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! Came in to the curbside service and it took about 10 minutes before any one actually helped us, then another 40 min. to get our food. While we were waiting one of the cooks dropped a spoon and then put it back into the food container. I will never go here ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Good food; friendly staff. There was even a singing waiter who had a pretty good voice!"}
{"text":"I only had a lunch take-out here so I can't say about service, but the inside decoration and atmosphere looks nice. The food - a half/half with salad and pasta was FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last Thursday and had a very bad experience. We have been regular diners here for the past ten years and have noticed a gradual deterioration in service and food quality. We ordered lobster ravioli and after a considerable wait finally got our food.  I immediately noticed a strong smell of ammonia (indicating spoiled seafood) as I took my first bite whereupon I immediately contacted thy manager 
who seemed surprised and disinterested. I asked him to figure up how much we owed for the beverages but he seemed too busy to care so after ten or so minutes we got up and walked out never intending to return again. A horrible dining experience!"}
{"text":"OMG, this placed SUCKED! One of our large group called the night before and let them know we were going to want separate checks, the manager said no problem. We got there, got seated, ordered and then we waited... 98% of the table got their food, the remaining 2% of us got our food after everyone was done. My pasta was swimming in lemon butter sauce, it was way too much.  They took the bottles of water off our table and quit asking/serving us any water after that.  When it came time for the checks, they came around AGAIN and asked us what we had. We had to go through our orders again.  They said it would be a few minutes and they would bring the checks back.  FORTY minutes later, they came back and said what we ordered didn't jive with what we said we ordered. They said it would be another five minutes to sort it out.  No way, this place was a joke. The manager made lame excuses.  The majority of us ended up leaving money on the table and walking out.  They got WAY more of a tip than they should have - I didn't want to wait around for change. From the beginning of our night there to the end was a complete disaster.  The food isn't even close to being Italian, just make this place a \"P\" for pass."}
{"text":"I will cut to the chase....we arrived....were seated promptly....ordered a bottle of wine and things went downhill quickly.  The server brought the bottle.   Couldn't open it...went for help. ..came back with the cork half out....removed the cork screw and proceeded to try and pull the cork out with her hand. ... my husband finally
 rescued her...put the cork screw back in the bottle and removed the cork.  The entire time the server was apologizing that she never serves bottles of wine.   When I said it was not her fault .... she needed more training. ...she commented that her manager was mean and would probably yell at her for not being able to open the wine I told to have the manager talk to me.   I took pity on the poor untrained sweet server until she neglected to bring the salad we ordered before our entrees and then asked if we wanted it afterwards.  She stopped by seconds into our eating the entree and asked how it tasted then 5 minutes later brought us the check and told us no hurry....I'm still eating and she has already come back and asked if the check was ready. ...NO!  I might have tried the lemon cake but am afraid what another order might entail.   It's Sunday night in February in arizona....most restaurants are on a wait....macaroni grill at desert ridge is at best 10% occupied.....I wonder why??!!  What a shame.   My food was good and so was my husband's    Not stellar but value for the price paid.   Sadly,  we will NOT be back.

POST SCRIPT..
As I was finishing the last of my glass of wine, a fight broke out in the kitchen that had all the restaurant staff scurrying. ..words that I will not repeat were flying very loudly.  My husband and I quickly left our table before finishing  because the fight was getting worse and we were concerned.

Many wonderful restaurants in the neighborhood. ..DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill seems to always be dumped on with ratings. Went for take out last night. Ordered the create your own pasta dishes. Did not take long to make. Walked in, manager brought me my food and the bill, was real freindly. Restaurant looked clean and inviting. The pasta was tatsty and still hot when I got home. It was a generous portion too. 4 stars because I ordered an apetizer called mac and cheese bites with a truffle dip and although it was tasty, the portion was too small, like a few bites, not enough for even one person."}
{"text":"Consistency is quality! And that's one thing Macaroni Grill does not have is consistency. Every time my husband and I go in and order our salads on a weekly basis they always always always get them wrong.  This has happened on several occasions and on a few of them it took additional trips back the kitchen to get them right. Tonight was the last straw! The male MOD not only took our order but he brought them himself and they BOTH were incorrect!   He was aloof and didnt seem to care about our experience.  So much for date night, or any other night for that matter at Macaroni Grill!  Buh-Bye!  Hello Bella Luna!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place but not a great place either...our server Shannon was pleasant and all but there seems to be a lack of teamwork from other waiters. She had several tables and did all she could but clearly needed help. No fault of her own she really did move quickly and always smiled. Felt bad when a female manager told her to get moving on clearing off tables. my food the lobster ravioli was ok not great but I ate it. My husband had the mamas trio and he loved it! We had the truffle Mac and cheese which is supposed to be a signature item...it was awful. Bruschetta app was really flavorful..overall it was an ok meal but it wouldn't be my first choice of places to go out..."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, around 12:30, and was promptly sat at a table, offered beverages and informed about specials by Matt. Later our server, Rowdy, came took our order and deliver our food in a prompt manner. Rowdy then was not to be seen for the rest of our stay. We finished our lunch, a table behind us was sat, lunch order taken and relived before we had to flag someone down to get the check. It seemed as if Matt was the only one working and Rowdy was no where to be seen.

The prices are fair, the bread is AMAZING, the food is OK, but the service is lacking."}
{"text":"Sunday 7:00 PM, ONE waiter alone taking care of the entire restaurant. Poor guy was swamped. What was the manager thinking!?  Four tables occupied, not too many clients, but service was absolutely atrocious. Took forever to request orders for drinks and even longer to place food orders. Waiter was swamped elsewhere so he made mistakes in the orders. One member of our party was upset at getting the wrong order  after waiting thirty minutes, she cancelled her dinner, not willing to wait another long period of time before receiving her corrected order.

Not the waiter's fault, we understand that. Don't know what happened to this place, used to be a terrific restaurant.  The food was good, so for that, they get the one star."}
{"text":"This establishment is disgusting. The blinds are filthy. Our appetizer came out on a broken plate. We notified the manager who assured us she would take it off our bill and \"throw it at her kitchen staff.\" We kinda believed her. At one point an alarm went off in the kitchen area and the manager could be heard screaming \"who opened the door?\""}
{"text":"Soo good. Friendly staff. Nough said"}
{"text":"A super great restaurant, the service, the food, the flavor, taste, and freshness; all excellent.
My lamb was cooked a little rare so immediately they apologized profusely and replaced the order and the entire plate with a brand-new fresh lamb roast that was cooked to perfection. I was thankful for their very respectful service."}
{"text":"Really this cost money I have had better food on cheap buffets. Bread and tea was ok. Had chicken Marsala little chicken pieces not to bad until you got a bite of the garlic it was bad. Would not go back if it was free. Wife had chicken under a brick the potatoes where cold chicken was dry. Not recommended. Go to bk"}
{"text":"Hubby and I ate here while on a business trip. Chose this restaurant as we had a gift card. The place was surprisingly empty and we were seated right away. Our server was a delightfully charming young lady, willing to answer many questions. 
As he is not a fan of pasta, Hubby ordered a steak, with the mac and cheese side. I ordered Penne Rustica, only substituted angel hair for the penne. We both ordered caesar salads, which were accompanied by a deliciously crusty bread. Our meals were surprisingly tasty, our only complaint being that we were unable to finish them after the wonderful caesar sald and bread. 
We are not usually fans of chain restaurants for a nicer meal, however, this was  a nice, unpretentious, well prepared, consistent meal. We would go back."}
{"text":"I didn't know when you dine at a restaurant that a prerequisite for a waiter was sporting a \"Man bun\" ...  But four of the five waiters were wearing them... Our waitress wasn't efficient at her job, as I asked for clean bread plates since ours were dirty and wet she obliged and brought bread and no plates so I ate the bread and scooped the crumbs ... we ordered a couple adult beverages and took forever to get them since our bartender (who also sported the \"man bun\") was MIA and our waitress said that he was \"backed up\".. maybe that's why he wasn't behind the bar... food was decent , my wife ate her whole meal . So we will come back and see if they can do a better job!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here and had the Parmesan Crusty chicken salad and it was good. Great service, not crowded. I would definitely go again"}
{"text":"The mushroom appetizer was awesome. The margarita was horrible....tasted like a mix. I ordered the steak, medium rare. It was grizzly and uneatable. The manager apologized and did not charge us for it. I might go to this restaurant again if I'm in the mood for all the noise from the kitchen which is open."}
{"text":"I actually like coming to this location although they can get really busy and the wait times can be long. 
The servers are friendly ... and who doesn't like to write on the table with a crayon?
I really enjoy the eggplant parmesan or chicken parmesan- their salad is remarkable and fresh with a lighter dressing than that of Olive Garden.
For an Italian Chain Restaurant it is really good. 
The decor is nice with cafe italian style look. 
Definitely a fun place for a crowd... or an intimate dinner for TWO.

Ok Addendum to the above review : Went here last night on a date. He ordered Chicken Alfredo , I ordered Chicken Parm. I liked my dinner ... did not like the appetizer stuffed mushrooms... (crab is usually not that fishy tasting)

Also the salad had a funny taste.

My server was nice ... but he was more interested in flirting with my date than serving us. Also getting a refill on water... Good thing I wasn't dehydrated because ... i had to keep asking.

He did somewhat make up for it by filling a bag full of bread with our leftovers...

Whatever!

Won't be back for awhile!"}
{"text":"Three tables at lunch and have been waiting 25 mins! When I get my salad and appetizer I wait longer to eat because I have no silverware. Water completely empty throughout meal. He said he'd bring more but never did the manager actually came over to refill our glasses."}
{"text":"The food is as good or bad as any other Macaroni grill but the reason I have given them 5 stars is because of their stupendous service. I ordered a vegetarian dish and found two small pieces of chicken in the sauce. They not only got me a new dish within 10 minutes, they also took it off the tab."}
{"text":"Excellent service! My sever Don was also excellent he was a very well spoken gentleman, knew his food and described it very well. Made it sound very delicious lol we got the bruschetta and Caesar salad as an appetizer and it was excellent. My lasagna was great the ricotta cheese and Italian sausage it was layered, very good!! The bread that you get before you meal is excellent. I recommend this place and I will come back here again and again"}
{"text":"Very good food! I always get their macaroni and cheese. Even though the prices are high, they have great food. Plus you get free bread.
And best waitress I have had in years!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on a whim. Charming restaurant, fun atmosphere. Michelle was our server and she's cool. Enjoyed the spaghetti and meatballs!"}
{"text":"We went to Macaroni Grill on Stapley tonight for my wife's birthday.  We hadn't been there in quite awhile but had a gift card so we figured we would give it a try.  We had eaten there once awhile back and had a good experience. Well tonight was not a good experience.  In fact, it sucked.  The place was not busy at all, yet we had to wait  five minutes at the check-in counter for an employee to bother to come to the check-in counter and seat us.  While walking to be seated the employee suggested that we sit by the fireplace.  My wife usually gets cold so we thought that would be a great.  Oops.  The two tables closest to the fireplace were full of dirty dishes and half-eaten food.  We were then seated at the next closest table.  After being seated for 10 minutes, our waitress finally bothered to show up at the table.  She didn't bother to say \"hello\" or \"hi\" or \"welcome\" or anything.  The first and only thing she said was \"what do  you want to drink?\"  She offered no drink suggestions, no \"would you like to try,\" and no \"would you also like water?\"  After taking our drink orders she just walked away.  She did bring our drinks promptly to her credit and proceeded to take our food order.  Once again, she offered no specials or recommendations.  She simply asked what we wanted.  I ordered the Penne Rustica with a caesar salad and my wife ordered the Lasagna Bolognese.  After ordering, I asked the waitress if the caesar salad had anchovies in it (because I am not a fan of little fish - whether to eat or look at in a fish tank) to which she said it did not.  As we sat and waited for our food, we couldn't help but remember that they served us bread with olive oil for dipping last time we were here.  We looked around and other patrons had bread, yet we did not.  Additionally, I wondered when my salad would be out.  After about 10 or 15 minutes, our not-so-friendly waitress brought out our food (yes the food was ready quite promptly), but minus the caesar salad.  I asked her if we were supposed to get bread. She looked puzzled and said \"oh the other servers didn't bring that out to you?  They were supposed to.\"  I then asked her if we could get some water and she also said \"they didn't bring you that either?  Ok I'll get it right out for you.\"  I didn't ask her about my salad just because I wanted to see if she would ever catch it.  She didn't catch the lack of bread or water without me asking after all.  It was about this time that we realized the two tables closest to the fireplace were still littered with dirty dishes.  We then realized there were absolutely no bus-boys in the restaurant and were only four servers (they weren't busy at all so four servers should have been sufficient).  It seemed very unlikely that one of the other three servers in the restaurant was supposed to bring us bread and water - it was our waitresses job and she screwed it up so she tried to blame it on the unknown server.  We began to eat our food and found that it was actually quite good.  Shortly thereafter our waitress finally brought the promised bread...but no waters.  We asked yet again for the water.  We finally got water when we were nearly done eating.  I left a little review on the table in crayon, paid the check and left a whopping 8% tip (about 10% more than she deserved) and left.  And yes, the two table closest to the fireplace were still dirty.  So in summary, food was pretty good.  Service was horrific - no appetizer bread was brought until after we had our meal, no water was brought until the end of the meal, dirty tables around us, and my fish-less caesar salad was never brought.  Oh yeah, and our waitress seemed annoyed that we were there the entire time.  That's nice.  I'm glad we paid for that."}
{"text":"I have been dining at the macaroni grill on Stephanie st in Henderson for over 10 years. In the past it was very good, not great, but always enjoyable. 
Last night forced me to never want to go to that location again. The service was acceptable, but the food quantity and presentation were terrible. I ordered the ratatouille, and when brought to the table I was told not to touch the bowl or underlying plate because they were burning hot. The plate was super hot and had obviously been put into the overhead broiler. That was rather strange because there was no cheese or anything on the plate that required the super hot broiler. I was super disappointed because there was sauce splattered all over the edge of the bowl. Very poor presentation. The portion was also very small for $14.95.
The manager did comp my meal, but that's no why I brought these issues to the waitresses attention. In addition,  the bread must be made off premise because it's not as crisp as normal.
I think the final straw was when leaving I noticed the 2 line cooks in the open kitchen both had cell phone earpieces on while cooking. If I ran this restaurant I would be looking for an entire new kitchen cook staff"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the reviews are so negative on this place. I haven't eaten in a Macaroni Grill in years, but it is still good. Not the best food in the world, but tasty and a nice atmosphere. I had the blackened chicken Parmesan and it was very good. 
We went for lunch, and it wasn't terribly busy (maybe all of the negative reviews on here are affecting it?). But the service was great. Mikey was our server--he was really nice and plenty attentive. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Service was average. Isn't really as fancy as a remember it to be a year ago. Portions sizes weren't that big. Ordered Carmelas Chicken and it was alright (rather on the bland side). We had a gift card to use here, or else this is not a place I would typically choose. Not a restaurant I'm dying to go back to."}
{"text":"Took 50 minutes to get our pasta and we were the only ones in there. It came not cooked enough.  Only 5 people came in during the 1 1/2 hr we were there. Very disappointing. We won't be back ever"}
{"text":"Fair Waiter, VERY long wait for food (a few times we said \"hey we got here before they did why did they get their food before us ?). 
They give you free bread. I pigged out and got the italian nachos - sounds weird but that was the best thing I had.
Middle of our dinner was interrupted by the 'entertainment' - a man yelling at the crowd about this italian song and that, then he started singing and wanted everyone to clap. Sorry, I'm just too cool (others may say uptight) to do that. Luckily my back was facing him it wasn't hard to ignore.
By the time my food came out I was thoroughly stuffed, so I just ate a few bites and put the rest in a box.

The food prices were very reasonable - I'd bet if they charged more nobody would visit, though.

Strangely the next day when I ate my leftovers they tasted much, much better. I guess hunger is the best spice!

I've been to other Macaroni grills and they just seemed to be better than this place."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad about Macaroni Grill, if you have a large group and can't decide on a place it can actually be alright. I just don't have much faith in Italian chains in general. I've gone there with a group 6-8 times and was there just recently and I can't recall anything I've ate. I have negative aspiration to return."}
{"text":"Sunday evening...winding down but pasta all on point. Seafood in Pasta di Mare was great. Bellini from the bar was a send back, but we have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I've bought better food in a bag at a grocery store. The booth tables are flimsy. Some of the tables are too close together so the servers kept bumping into me. Over and over again."}
{"text":"This location use to be great! Food was always consistent. However something changed in the last few years as they can't seem to get the to go orders correct to Dave their lives. From receiving the wrong food; to ordering & paying but not receiving; but the final straw was receiving vinegar in my food which I'm highly allergic ~ I emphasized it as such. Still got it. Was shocked & gave up as we were both tired of making a 2nd trip (each order that was wrong) to correct."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to the Macaroni Grill for a few years and thought we would grab a quick meal there last night. What a disappointment! Their standards have fallen considerably. First of all the place looks somewhat dingy. Our silverware was dirty as was the wall next to our booth. Even the menu that was handed to us needed recycling. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer. Somehow they ran out? and had to prep some more. I ordered the carbonara which was not like any I'd ever had or made. It was totally bland. We had asked the waiter for grated cheese after he served us however he then disappeared for several minutes while we looked for him waiting to eat our food. My wife's sole had a lemon butter sauce without the lemon which upset her stomach. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. When we left the place was virtually empty. It will be a long time before we go back there. The restaurant seems to have given up on being outstanding and is just coasting. Mr. Romano, can you hear me? You have a restaurant in Mesa that needs attention!"}
{"text":"Genuinely confused why there are so many negative reviews. Came here with my husband recently and was seated promptly at a little romantic table by the wine wall. The decor is cool and the service was definitely 5 star. It was a taller, blonde gentleman that served us, and he was great. Next time I need to get his name. He was knowledgable and made suggestions. He was also great at timing the food and not rushing anything. That's a big deal, people don't give that enough credit. It was busy and everything came out perfectly. You have to eat the meatball appetizer. I mean you are missing out on life if you pass that up!! 

This place is also nice to come for a glass of wine at the wine bar and have an appetizer. Love it."}
{"text":"A big thank you to the staff at the North Olmsted Romano's Macaroni Grill! We held an after funeral lunch there yesterday for 42 people, and the staff and service was outstanding! The food was excellent and the wait staff went out of their way to take care of the family, even taking a group photo for us. I received many compliments from the attendees on choosing Macaroni Grill for this event. And thank for allowing us to celebrate my mother's passing with traditional Irish song!"}
{"text":"good food, lots of options, service can be awkward at times and our meal came out way too fast but overall prices and tastes are great!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time --- in 1993, to be exact -- I moved to Arizona and took a job as a singer/host at the Macaroni Grill in Scottsdale.  I mention this to kinda give me bona fides as someone, who knows what the place was once like and what it is now.

Back then, there wasn't much good dining in Arizona and on weekend nights, people would line up and wait for more than an hour to get a seat in the place ... and it was worth it.  The food was very good, the prices reasonable, the service excellent.

But that was then.

Macaroni Grill, like many restaurants, got slapped badly in the Great Depression of 2008.  The pressure was on everyone to cut costs or die.  This restaurant was no different.  But in their case, they should have shut their doors and spared all of us their pain.

I can't speak for other locations, but the Goodyear branch has deteriorated into little more than a ruin of its former self and a bad joke.  Their famous Bellinis, that frozen drink, which put the restaurant on the map for so many people, are gone ... replaced by a watered-down, non-frozen insult of its former glory.  The portions of the food have gotten smaller, but not the prices for them.  The menu has lost so many items, they might as well just hand out flyers at the door listing what they have available.  For that matter, maybe not:  most of what they serve is inedibly oversalted or mushy and I'm guessing the chefs are secretly opening Weight Watchers boxes and dumping the contents into pans on the counter to fool anyone, who might be watching. (Oh Hell, WHY am I insulting Weight Watchers? ... Even they could do better than this!).

There is only one saving grace here and, ironically, it shouldn't be such a big deal:  the bread.  It's still as good as ever and beats out most of what you find for what poor excuses of bakeries we have here in the Valley.  And, to be fair, their desserts are still pretty good, too (i.e., that means, the Tiramisu), though not as good as they were in the past.

Service in this branch is pathetic.  It's not the servers' fault.  Management, as in so many places, seems to be more concerned with nitpicking and watching what everyone is doing than making sure service is prompt and correct.  Food orders are constantly screwed up  (I'm not talking about one visit here, folks ... and if it's happening to me more than once when I've hit the place every six months or so, what does that tell you about typical daily performances?).  Waiters show up to
check on whether you need refills about as often as doctors get to your appointments on time; those with blood pressure problems most likely will find less salt in their food if they fish something out of the Dead Sea.  On the other hand, there's nooooo problem finding a seat in here, even on a Friday night.

Sometimes, when a beloved pet gets old and the quality of its life has degenerated to a point, where it would be best to put it out of its misery, it's hard to put aside your selfish needs to do the right thing.  Macaroni Grill:  beg for the needle already!"}
{"text":"All in all, not a \"great\" visit. Our waiter started out very good, but we were fairly early and it wasn't busy yet. He slowed quite a bit once he got more than 2 tables. At one point, I did see a manager helping in the kitchen, but once he came out, all he seemed to do was walk around, only spoke to 3 tables in the hour and a half that we were there. The WORST thing, the bartender was walking back and forth through the restaurant carrying a bug sprayer! He walked down the server side of the kitchen line, into the bar area at least twice, then through the front of the restaurant again. Never in my life have I seen that! Not sure we'll EVER go back to this location."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Having grown up in Arizona I make sure to always stop by here when I am home. On my most recent visit I was very excited about the new express lunch option they offer. My brother, husband and I all ordered salads and then sandwiches. The caprese sandwich with grilled chicken is phenomenal! We were there at an off time between 2:30-3:30 so we were not expecting amazing service but we had the server, Brittany, constantly refilling our drinks and both managers, Chris and Tim, stopped by to introduce themselves and check in at separate times. We were thoroughly impressed. They even brought out their new Nutella french toast to try for dessert as we were talking about it. It was so delicious (see photo). They truly went above and beyond.  Will be back again soon! Thanks for a great meal"}
{"text":"Had such a great first time experience here. The food was amazing, and our server Sam Quinn was so sweet and provided excellent service. Highly recommend it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This week I had a catering order of 30 men. I was nervous to try a new place than my normal go-to sub shop, however I was so impressed with Akil's presentation from a couple of months ago I decided to just go with it. 
To my surprise the order was 100% correct, Debbie did not forget any items (normally over looked items:  cups, utensils, napkins, seasonings, oils, ice, etc). Everything was so good that my boss texted me later that evening to tell me how impressed he and everybody else was with lunch. He has NEVER sent me a text outside of work hours. 
I will definitely use them again for catering, highly impressed!"}
{"text":"Oh, where do I begin??
We went to Macaroni Grill for dinner because we had a BOGO coupon. The food is usually pretty good, but that night it was lacking. Mine turned out fine, but my boyfriend's was totally wrong! He asked for \"sun dried tomatoes\" and got just regular chopped up tomatoes, he also asked for fresh garlic and got none! 
The waiter was very anxious! He barely stopped to listen to what I was trying t ask for and before I was even finished with my statement he was off doing something else. It took him at least 20 minutes between coming back over to our table and doing other stuff. But when he finally did come back, he NEVER offered to refill my drink. I had to ask another waiter to get it for me. Even then, I never got it until much later!! By then, I was almost finished with my meal anyway. 
Then, when he brought us our check, he had the nerve to say \"now that I've helped you, can you please help the kids?\" I thought he was kidding at first, but he wasn't! He then went on to explain that they had some sort of contest going on to see who can get the most donations. We obviously declined. 
Anyway, I think we'll stick to eating on the Strip next time. At least we know what kind of service to expect there!"}
{"text":"Took my wife there for the does time.  The server was amazing!!! Atmosphere, amazing!!! B most of the food, amazing. We got the special. The one that comes with four courses and then sweepers of meat the meat had ZERO flavor. None. Not even salt. It was odd.  I wonder if they forgot? 

Like I said the rest was good. Ps. Olive Garden has better Alfredo.  

I would go again, just not soo"}
{"text":"The service can be hit or miss. The last few times the service was good. I like the changes that the restaurant is doing. (Back to a singer on occasion) The bread this last time was great. The food was good. I had the shrimp portifino.  The spinach was slightly overcooked,  but the rest was good. The shrimp tasted clean and fresh. I love the cheesecake at this place. I prefer to eat in, take out tends to skimp. The bread is smaller (it seems) but more importantly,  the oil and pepper give are not enough for the whole loaf. I had also asked for shredded cheese to be included and it was forgotten.  So it looks like I will be eating in and paying more for the food's sake."}
{"text":"Was super bored last night after my date flaked on me ( imagine that..a Vegas girl flaking??  NO!!! ) So I jumped on my motorcycle and decided to check this place out since it is super close to my house. Well I walk in around 7:30pm and it is DEAD, so I walk to the bar so I can relax,eat and watch some football. Not sure what the bartenders name was, redhead with shaved head. He was Great! Didn't bug me much and was always keeping me topped off on my drink and checking on me at the right  times without being overbearing. 
Food was chicken scallopini which was tender and moist and cooked just right. I was a little nervous at first because this place should have been packed since it was dinner time and nobody was there. It might have been the construction out front on Sahara keeping them away though, who knows. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is very unorganized.  I will not be back.

We had to ask twice to get menus.  The pre-meal bread was cold.  Got the beverage near the end of the meal. They were out of the entree that my guest ordered. It took them 15 minutes to realize that and let us make another selection.

The sauce on the pasta I ordered was disgusting.  It tasted only slightly better than Chef Boyardee. 

Avoid this place and go to a better restaurant  ..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the catering service! I called to order a meal to feed 20 people. I was so embarrassed and hungry when the food arrived.  It looked like they brought enough to feed 10 people. It looked like they skimped us on the order.  They brought us more salad than any of the chicken or pasta that we ordered. The chicken breasts were cut in half. So 24 half of a chicken breast really was 12 chicken breasts. Surely not enough to feed 20 people! The caterers should have known better. You could tell they didn't know what they were doing. I know I was still starving after this meal, and not everyone got to eat. Very very disappointed! My worst fear of not ordering or having enough food has happened!"}
{"text":"Well, I chose this national chain restaurant near the mall over other similar options. The hostess promptly seated me. The server promptly came to my table. When I asked about a gluten free menu, she said they currently do not have one since they just changed the seasonal menu (hmmmm). But I built my own pasta using their GF penne. I really enjoyed my own creation. And my server used her crayons to write \"no bread\" on the paper table cloth--great idea and saved me the hassle of constantly dealing with people trying to give it to me. 
Now for a bathroom rant. Oh Macaroni Grill. Who at corporate decided that black and red was a good choice?  Red grout on black tile?  It feels sooooo goth. Don't get me wrong, black grout is a good choice for a public bathroom floor. It hides dirt. And why are you playing loud ads about coming to Macaroni Grill?  I'm already there!! The whole atmosphere is garish and high energy. I would expect it in an edgy bar, maybe even a hipster coffee shop. But if you want me to take you seriously, class it up. And this particular facility--needs the faucets replaced, they are corroding badly. And the black plastic garbage can look cheap and are dirty. It's not a restful place. Sigh."}
{"text":"I have been eating here on an off since they opened ... I like there food and the 7 minute lunches are on point went there for lunch the other  day in and out 25 min. The service was great was happy and will continue to go there"}
{"text":"Great service! Donny, our server, was great, very friendly & helpful. The gentleman who sat us seemed very quiet, but midway through our dinner he sang a beautiful performance. The restaurant was comparable to others in the chain and was clean. The food, as always was delicious."}
{"text":"The new staff and management team here rock!  Fantastic food and service!  Love it!!  Huge portions at a fair price!  Always a bag of delicious leftovers too!  Highly recommend these guys!  Manga!!"}
{"text":"I was here for a business lunch on 04/05/2016. Food was mediocre. My ravioli was dripping oil. Service was absolutely terrible. My server had no personality and did not come refill our water and tea.  When it was time for the check, she boxed my two partners' meals and brought them back in a box and in a bag. She then asked me if I wanted a box??? I boxed my own food in front of my two colleagues. I don't understand why she boxed theirs and had me box my own? Why not have all of us box our own? Not only did we have a disappointing lunch, we were left dumbfounded by the service. I will never come here again. To our server, maybe you should consider a different career path. You obviously have things you might be better at."}
{"text":"Have not been here for sometime, WOW what happened, great meal last time. Was in early and not very crowded.  late delivery and luke warm appetizer. luke warm soup and two entres. Lasanga not hot very little favor, boring besides lots of pasta sheets. Son was served his entre 10 minutes before the rest of us, turns out he was served another tables meal. Down hill, server had all kinds of excuses for the kitchen, other servers. very disappointing."}
{"text":"I had chicken parm for lunch & it was delicious. My waiter was delightful. Great meal for a fair price. I haven't been there in a while and we'll be going back again soon"}
{"text":"Came in Saturday, a little after 5:00, very few customers and plenty of staff. We sat for several long minutes before they finally figured out who would serve us. The food came quickly, and was hot but just adequate. The lobster ravioli tasty fishy and the chicken was dry. It had been a long time since we had been to a Macaroni Grill. We see no reason to rush back."}
{"text":"Oh oh where to begin...My daughter was visiting me from Canada, and I had heard this place was fantastic.  Anyways, we enter and were seated promptly (around 1:00PM). The waitress took our drink order and also brought us a loaf of Rosemary Peasant Bread. Upon viewing the menu, I heard two men sitting behind me order off an Express Lunch Menu. Ok, so when she came back to our table I enquired about this menu. Well you would have thought I'd asked her for her right arm-she went on and on about it not really being available, to which behind my daughter in BOLD BLACK letters on the chalk board, it said available everyday. Reluctantly, she brought us those menus. My daughter and I ordered a starter Caesar salad and the Parmesan Truffle Fries, along with 2 pasta dishes. She then informed us, that the Peasant bread (that we had already ate) was NOT included with the Express Lunch Menu and that she would have to charge me for it! Like f--k--g seriously??!! We did NOT ask for it to begin with!! It was only $1.00 but that's besides the point. That waitress (Cheryl) was a wing-nut!! One of the worst waitress experiences I have had. And as for the fries, it was just the cheap powdered parmesan cheese sprinkled on them and not a hint of truffle, let alone the supposed house-made balsamic ketchup!! That came straight out of a bottle and most likely not Heinz. The pasta had good flavour but was barely warm!! Needless to say-I/we won't be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night for dinner for what was sadly the last time, in all honesty. Used to LOVE this place, but it has gone downhill dramatically over the past year or so.

Evening was off to a bad start when a runner to the bar felt the need to walk *between* my wife and I rather than simply walking around is in the otherwise spacious lobby area.

Once seated we placed our order for apps and dinner. Apps were fine. Salads are now 1/2 the size they used to be but 30% higher price. I could almost excuse this if it weren't for the rest of the evening...

Wife's dinner came out promptly... And cold. Sent it back and was told my meal would be right out. My dinner arrived 10 minutes later. Wife's lukewarm meal returned 5 minutes after that. Waitress finally arrived where I had to ask for grated Parmesan for my meal that was on the way to being finished. Asked for a refill on iced tea. 10 minutes later had to ask for iced tea again.

Very disappointed that this place has declined so noticeably. Hate to say it, but this was our last visit. A longtime customer has had enough of being let down."}
{"text":"Fruite di mare.. Frozen fishy smelling mussels, appetizer that was served frozen , it was supposed to be a melted cheese.dish.  these guys are amateurs.  2.5 stars is being overly kind.  Still charged for frozen appetizer.  $60 wasted.  1 hour of my life wasted.  They need to shut the door and give up.  Never again....."}
{"text":"What a let down. After not eating at This Macaroni Grille in 3 years my wife and I stopped and ate here after my daughters dance recital and it was ok, not great but ok. We decided to meet for dinner there today and I asked my family to join us and it was not good. The place was not that crowded and they appeared short staffed. Or table for six was two put together with a 1/2 in crack where they joined together, on wine glass flipped over and the server said that had happened earlier to someone else? Would you not have thought they would have fixed it? The food was slow to the table and 3 of the 6 entrees was stone cold, one was hot and two were warm. The manager offered to heat it up, the plate came back hot with the food still cold. Well there was more but I'm done. None of my party will return to this place, it's sad there was nothing really good about the experience at all."}
{"text":"One & done with this place. First beer options extremely limited as not even Kilt-lifter, for a start, foound a substitute but moving on...had to ask for napkin/silverware mom not happy. Then when it did arrive silverware was dirty with dried pasta followed up by the server saying she would Polish it when asked for new set. Next server arrived and did not ask us a question like if we wanted an appetizer or salad prior to ordering so what do you want today. Too bad because a) it would have been nice b) normally when done we do and key here it increases your tip or can help it. My favorite penne rustica was actually barely luke warm, bland, and then dry too because hardly any sauce-after making sure they could make it because the sauce might not be there from delivery.  Mom's pasta was also bland, had to ask for more garlic and again not enough sauce and MIA on the majority of the  seafood it was supposed to have in it. The only positive was the bread and dad's ratatouille once the red pepper flakes were added. Very disappointing and sad as once upon a time this was a favorite place."}
{"text":"Romano Kitchen Counter , hmm.
Certainly not 7 in 7, as promoted when I ordered lunch. 
Normal service time for table service usually extended. The current promotion no better. I am extremely disappointed because I like the menu.  I can only question : are they understaffed?"}
{"text":"Well going to revise my review. Took an hour for our food to be served. It was wrong. Twice. Then we waited for the check, took another 30 minutes. Seriously macaroni grill, get your act together. We were offered free dessert, sorry but that doesn't make up for the really bad service. And the place was empty. No apologies from management. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Waited 45 min for 2 dishes and the restaurant wasn't busy. We never even had a waitress. Just random workers checking on us and apologizing. Very disappointing. This used to be one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for what you get. Ordered steak salad and lettuce was soggy, steak was tough. Lobster ravioli was 3 ravioli and very little lobster. Price was 18.50. I would want a lobster tail for that price. The Macaroni and Cheese bites smelled and tasted like fish so I assume they fry the bites in the same oil they fry the calamari. Do not go and avoid unless you like paying way too much and getting nothing."}
{"text":"Long wait for poor quality of food and horrible service.  Server got our order all wrong. Never apologize, never explained why.  My daughter's meal never reached the table and was on the check.  Took my  Fettuccine to go and when I got home it had a hair in it.   Fettuccine were dry, cold and did not taste fresh.  It was a disaster. Will never be here again."}
{"text":"This place is delightful. A nice atmosphere with food that comes out quick but tasty! They also have a great wine selection. Zoe is the best server there. She's so sweet and attentive. I would recommend this place to anyone, especially this location in particular!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, service not bad. We went out there for a team lunch. The zucchini fritti is good, bruschetta sub-standard, chicken parmegiana looked like an omelette but tasted fairly good. Prices are high like most Italian restaurants. With Italian food being almost like a staple in the United States, why it is so pricey, beats me! I think it is a Highly overrated cuisine. If there are suckers willing to pay, there are always Businesses waiting to pick your pockets!!!"}
{"text":"The waitress was nice greeting us as we walked in, and seated us at a nice booth with the crumbs of the last patrons glittering the seats. My wife and i shrugged it off as we rarely get to have lunch together on a weekday. She ordered an italian soda and i ordered a ice water with lemon to drink as we studied the menu. The drinks came and the italian sodas cream had curdled in the glass making it look and taste VERY unappealing, while my water tasted.....bleachy. The server said she'd correct it, and took our order. Little butternut squash cheesy pasta is all my wife could think about since she laid eyes on the menu, guess what? SOLD OUT!  At lunch on a Tuesday? Waitress came back with the Italian soda and it was every bit as curdled as the first time! We asked for an iced tea instead, and guess what she brought? ANOTHER CURDLED ITALIAN SODA!!!!  Our lunch came and my pizza dough smelled like it was made with dirty pool water. My wifes pasta was good though. Them they charged us for a full size pasta instead of a lunch size(which is what we recieved) and ALL 3 CURDLED ITALIAN SODAS!! We will not be returning to macaroni grill."}
{"text":"Overall, Long wait for food, although restaurant was quite empty; flavorless appetizers and entrees; uninterested waiters; unsanitary environment......Went here for dinner with my s.o.  When entering, was quickly greeted  No table was \"ready,\" although there were many empty tables, but the host needed to clean the booth before we could sit.  About 5 minutes later we were seated.  We received bread, but in the middle of preparing the oil for the bread, the host, who ended up being our waiter for part of our meal, stopped and ran to get something for another customer, then returned to finish.  The menu was crusty with old food stains on them.  I tried the Bellini, which was too sweet, my s.o. initially ordered the Mojito, but they were out of mint, so he ordered a cosmo that was not good and most was spilled on the table because the cup was over filled.  Our second drink orders were taken by a different server, Freddie, our appetizer was served by yet another server, and then our meal was served incorrectly by Freddie, that took our order, never wrote it down, and ended up serving me the wrong meal.  When i mentioned this, the server quickly took my plate, and went to grab the correct plate, but did not alert me to the fact that he had not just grabbed the wrong plate, so I had to wait another 10 minutes for my food.  By the time the food came, I was ready to leave, I asked for a to go box and the check as he was placing my plate on the table.  We sampled our meals, and just like the appetizer, salad and pasta before the main dish, all seemed to be very bland, and reminded us of microwave dinners.  We were quite disappointed by the many servers (we still don't know who our waiter was, but did recognize the fact that we only saw them sporadically), we were unhappy with the quality of the food and drinks, and as we left, we both visited the restrooms.  Had I seen the restroom before we sat down for a meal, I would have eaten elsewhere.  EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK."}
{"text":"The food here is good. So why am I giving this place 3 stars? 

I'll start with the pros: the Parmesan crusted chicken salad is seriously the best. It's so good! Their bread is good. Chicken parm = good. I have no complaints about the taste of their food. 
They even have an incredible performer that goes around and does magic tricks while you wait for your food, and makes the time fly by. * IF you want to. It's free to enjoy and he is absolutely incredible to watch. He will knock your socks off. 

However:

My honest opinion is that a lot of the workers just don't care. The service is never great. We went out to eat at 6pm on a Saturday, and the place was so empty; we were some of the only customers there. Even with that in mind, I still felt so rushed. Wasn't asked if there was anything we needed. I asked for more bread and it never came. The soup was cold when it came out. Our check was handed super early and we weren't done eating. Ordered my water with extra lemon, and it didn't have one lemon in it. Our soup wasn't even empty (because we were still eating), and it was taken away from the table so quick we didn't even get a chance to say anything.... AWKWARD. 

Normally, I am very understanding when restaurants are jam-packed busy, but when you're some of the only customers in there, then that means they have the opportunity to go above-and-beyond, but... they just
don't. :/ 

Mind you, this place is not cheap. Especially if you factor in drinks, appetizers, and dessert if those are your thing. (We like to keep it simple with no appetizers and water) 

You pay good money to eat here. The service should be equivalent to what you're paying for."}
{"text":"Took over 10 minutes to be seated when the place was almost empty. Took another 10 minutes to even get our drinks ordered. We ordered our appetizer and meals - the waiter completely for got our appetizer but brought out our orders. The food didn't taste as good as I've come to expect from Macaroni Grill. The food seemed rushed and lacked flavor. Also noticed that there seemed to be a lack of staff. Definitely won't be returning to this particular location."}
{"text":"Went here Easter Sunday with Pops. Had a nice satisfying meal. The mushroom ravioli was very good. The chipped wine glass, not so much. The replacement Chianti glass was dirty on the outside. It came back so fast, I wondered if the server just wiped it off rather than replace it again, leaving me to speculate about the cleanliness of the inside of the glass. What did I do? Drink it of course, and drew pictures rather than conclusions. I  like restaurants where  they have crayons and paper table tops to draw on. Yes it is a chain, yes it is good and yes we will return some year, or a few years after that."}
{"text":"I may have said this before, but I am not a huge fan of Italian food.  What keeps me coming back to Macaroni grill is the Lobster Ravioli in lemon creme sauce and shrimp.  Simple dish with layer after layer of great flavors.

I came in around 4PM last night, so it was very quiet.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a review of their take out dining only. MG hosted a fundraiser for kids baseball team. 15% of the check was donated back to the school, really nice idea. It was very good and packaged nicely, service was solid too."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised at the caliber of food and service at this Macaroni Grill.  The reviews weren't great but it is located across the parking lot from the hotel where I say on frequent business trips.  After a long day at the office, we just didn't want to drive anywhere so a quick stroll to MG fit the bill.

The interior of this chain hasn't ever changed - same format, same decor but I guess rustic-Tuscan doesn't really go out of style.  We ordered cocktails, wine and dinner and our server was polite and efficient.  

I had the Eggplant Parmigiana and it was excellent - very lightly breaded topped with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce and a side of pasta.  Their portions are HUGE and definitely shareable.  

I am so glad we decided to give this location a try in spite of the less than stellar reviews - our experience will bring us back for sure."}
{"text":"Romano's Macaroni Grill of North Olmsted is a great place for southern Italian food.  We started with their signature Mac & Cheese Bites and Bruschetta, both were very good.   We had a delicious Mushroom Ravioli and an equally  tasty Cremini Pork Shank.  The staff are friendly and attentive and we didn't have to wait long for our meals.  The prices are reasonable for the quality of food."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is amazing. My first time here and will definitely be back. Please ask for Camal when you come in. He was awesome. He is one of the main reason I will be back. Very friendly with great customer service. He made us feel very welcome and at home!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a bargain with good Italian food? Look no further than Romano Macaroni Grill. 

We chanced upon this place while do some shopping. The bargain I'm referring to is the chef trio which features a Cesar or garden salad, choice of five different entrees and choice of three desserts for $12.99. 

I ordered the chicken milano which was bow-tie pasta with grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms in a garlic cream sauce. The portion was generous, so much so that I couldn't eat all of it. More importantly, it was very tasty. My sister and the honey ordered the chicken cannelloni which is cannelloni shells stuffed with grilled chicken, cheese and spinach in an Asiago cream sauce. The serving is three tubes and neither my sister or the honey were able to finish theirs. 

Dessert choices are sorbet, a devils food chocolate cake with chocolate sauce or a lemon cake. We ordered the sorbet and devils food cake. The cake was very moist, made even more intense with the chocolate sauce. 

An interesting approach to how they serve the house wine. A large bottle of the house wine is brought to your table. It's on the honor system. You pour yourself a glass and make a mark on the butcher paper on the table. At $4.99 a glass, it's quite reasonable. The Chianti was very smooth and had a good mouth feel. 

Our server, Chris, was just finishing his training as a waiter. He couldn't have been sweeter as well attentive. 

Macaroni's is a chain, but I'd definitely go back to this location for the food and service, especially when you can get such a bargain for a prie-fix."}
{"text":"Dinner for two...in and out in 45mins.   If you get a bottle of wine you'll find yourself pounding it.  This is probably why they could not find the bottle we ordered for 15minutes. Then had no idea how to serve it. The courses gets served on top of each other as if they need to get you out of there. Order the lobster ravioli and it tastes like fish sticks. Order the mushroom ravioli and it comes out like a plate of hot stew.  You can't tell what is the ravioli and what the burnt bits are.....bluntly...it was a mess.  I give one star because the bread is good, although oddly they leave a bottle of olive olive oil on the table straight from the store.....next to the crayons they have on the table so the server can write his name on the paper table cloth for you to remember. Come on.  Meal for two was $102 with wine and apps.  This place was a lot better a few years ago....now they can't even get the lighting right. Dump."}
{"text":"I went in to this location last night with a group of 4 for a birthday dinner. Our server was Sydney, she was extremely unattentive, slow, and wasn't aware of the evenings soup or specials. We ordered a bottle of one of their nicer wines and we're served in water glasses. The manager Kelly informed us this was typical which would have been over looked however when we were served, Sydney complained that we could have normal glasses though the bartender would get upset at her for asking. Also, we were never offered another bottle or upsale. She also failed to remove the dishes from earlier courses, so when we received the dessert for the birthday boy that was supposed to be on the house  ( that still made it on to our bill ) the table hardly had any space for it. After our lack of service, and waiting for over 10 min to pay the iccorrect bill. One member of our party asked to speak with a manager, he waited at the host stand for a long while before Kelly appeared. She seemed unpleasant and upset to deal with a patron and when she went to adjust the dessert price she rolled her eyes at our table. Then quickly left the front of the house without an apology or handling the situation, instead left it up to the already slow and unenthused server to tend the bill. I have been in the industry for over 9 years and have never made a complaint that should explain how horrible the \"service\" was. I'd give it negative stars if possible."}
{"text":"Very nice experience - and on a race weekend, too.  I  met friends for dinner who were in town for the Drag Race series, and our experience was completely opposite of many of the reviews here.  Our server was terrific, and our food arrived promptly and was delicious.  We made a couple of special requests - a side of alfredo sauce, etc. - that were filled promptly and without complaint.  Since we had not seen each other in 20 years (!), we lingered after we had finished eating.  When we apologized to our server for tying up his table, he couldn't have been nicer - and even offered us coffee \"on the house\" so we could continue talking and visiting.  When we finally left, we decided to sit outside on the porch to talk some more - and also decided to order dessert.  Although we were the only ones out there, another very courteous server took our order, brought the desserts and water all around, and never made us feel like we were an inconvenience.  It was a very pleasant evening with good food and thoughtful, prompt service.  No, it's not the most wonderful Italian food I've ever had, but for a quiet evening catching up with friends, it was perfect from start to finish!  I live in the southern end of Charlotte, so don't get up to the University area very much, but, should I have a reason to have dinner there again, I wouldn't hesitate to give Macaroni Grill my business!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Flavorful items, large portions, efficient wait staff! Bread is very tasty."}
{"text":"We were the unfortunate recipients of $200 in Romano's gift cards, so we've eaten there a few times recently. The birthday dinner we had was ok. We started with some of their new appetizers. Pass on them. The pesto bean bruschetta lacked flavor (where was the pesto??) and should have been served warm. The peppers were ok. The stuffed mushrooms were just boring. Our entrees came next. I had a pumpkin ravioli, which was quite good. Hubby got the trio and didn't even bring the spaghetti home. He said it was terrible. Birthday dessert was chocolate cake--it was so bland it went uneaten. The canoli weren't worth it, either.

We went back on a Saturday night. Was told there was a 45 minute wait. After 45 minutes they started seating people who ARRIVED AFTER US. When I complained, she said they had a reservation. I call bullsh-t on that. Then they seated ANOTHER group that arrived after us. Then she said there were 7 more parties before us. I told her to look around--there weren't 7 parties left to be seated. I was pissed. There was no apology. And no one over the age of 35 to complain too.

Our waiter was Aaron. it took him 8 minutes to greet us. We asked him three times for water for the table. We never received the promised plate to share our woefully under-dressed salad. I had the salmon entree and hubby had the porkchop. Both were cooked beautifully (and I had asked for the salmon pretty rare)--really perfect. Too bad they had NO FLAVOR. It was such a shame. It was a terrible dinner, over all...

F--- me, I still have $40 to spend. Hubby and I went several years ago and loved it. What happened??"}

REGARDING:  Kudos to Server Mary - 10+ service 
  Friday 4/18/15 Afternoon

REFERENCE:   Birthday Celebratory Visit With AZ family

Dear Executive Management:

 Your restaurant was picked randomly as one member of the family had a business meeting nearby.  We came from California to visit my son whom I had not seen since May last year.

 A beautiful drive with only a few rest stops had us arriving in eager anticipation.

 I walked in - was thirsty - asked for water; immediate assistance.  I looked around - there was an aura of warmth and hospitality.

 We were delighted with the menu; most of all with the server.

 Mary truly was phenomenal - never missed a beat - gave us the utmost in professionalism coupled with priceless hospitality service.

 She helped make my 74th so memorable.  Kudos to her.

 Please care/share with her - one/all.

 God Bless You All.
Respectfully, MJG

{"text":"I have to say that I worked for Macaroni Grille over ten years ago, and have never been back since I quit.  I always really like the food here, but after leaving, just thought it was pretty expensive for a place that gets all its sauces shipped in bags, but was at the mall, and figured why not.  We shared the Romano's sampler for the appetizer, and it was indeed pretty pathetic, with the two underfried mozzerella's, couple ounces of calamari, and lazy attempt at bruscetta.  After the appetizer was cleared, we waited for about 35 minuted for our entrees.  The restaurant was not even close to being half full, but seemed like they were understaffed.  Its the holidays, and we're at a mall.  You should have planned it out a little better it seems, as both the kitchen and servers were running around.  After finally receiving entrees, I was very dissappointed, as my meal just fell flat.  I had to try a few things, so again went for a sampler type thing.  This had lasagna, chicken parmesean, and cannelloni.  THe lasagna was not terrible, just seemed very palin compared to what I remember.  The chicken was underseasoned, and the crust was a little burnt, and none of it had any flavor at all.  The canneloni was crispy, then covered with sauces which gave it a weird (gross) texture.  I think I'll wait another ten years before I go back again."}
{"text":"Hello, $25 gift card from an old student's mom to one of four \"area chain restaurants!\"  Enter Macaroni Grill.

Doing some holiday shopping at the North Olmstead Mall (horror), we happened upon Macaroni Grill by accident and were psyched that we didn't have to pay to eat lunch.  Score!

Everyone was really friendly.  And I kinda got the feeling they really meant it, and not just in that \"I'm paid to act friendly 'cause I work in a chain restaurant and my greetings are scripted\" sort of manner.  

I ordered a cup of the \"seasonal soup,\" which was a tomato/basil with cheese tortellini in it.  Weird, and kinda tasted like tomato sauce, but still good.  I was actually brought a bowl, not a cup, but was only charged for the cup.  Score #2!

For my meal I got a chicken caesar salad.  I had asked for the dressing on the side, and it came on the salad.  No matter; it wasn't drenched in dressing.  Whatevs.  It would have been too much of a hassle to send it back and wait.  The salad was really good and the chicken was chilled, which I really prefer on a salad as opposed to warm strips.  My husband got some grilled sausage skewer something-or-other with grilled vegetables.  It was gross.  He stole some of my chicken.  I didn't really care, because the portions were so big and I couldn't finish it anyway.  

I was very impressed by the bread, which was a big hunk of rosemary-ciabatta-type thing.  The waitress brought us more as soon as the first one was done.  And she kept offering us cracked pepper.

Moving on to score #3.  The bill.  It was only $24.21 including tax!  We only had to pay for the tip!  Nice work, Macaroni Grill.

NB: They had sooo many bottles of their house Chianti it was almost oppressive.  These bottles of wine factored heavily into the decor, taking up most of the shelves around the restaurant, as well as any free table space.  It was scary."}
{"text":"The first time I ate Macaroni Grill was in Ca, where I took my fiancé to eat. We even had a gentleman sing at our table , but that was then. I came to this place which I see 2 1/2 stars it should be - 2 stars. I had the waiter come to our table with no intentions of serving. I told him I would love to try the wine of the day. Sure he serves it on a glass not on a wine glass. I didn't drink it the glass had spots dirty... the food well, not to good the bread you get before eating hard and rubbery . I skipped dessert but couldn't skip the over priced so called Italian Food. Im sticking with Spaghetti Factory & Carraba's. Not bringing my friends nor Family at Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"Ambience was okay. I felt like I was sitting in a cafeteria. The food was rather bland and it kind of felt like I was an old person in a rest home on a specialty diet. I spoke to the management and there did not seem to be any concern at all. She said \"that's the way they always do it\". I ordered the lasagna and I believe the commercial product \"Mrs. Stouffers Lasagna\" would've been much better flavor. My wife had Chicken Marcella and that was equally bland. After four forkfuls each, we left the rest of the dinner paid the bill and left. Would we return? Not a chance in the world!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Mediocre food (at best). Very disappointed because I raved to my boyfriend how much I enjoyed dining here 2 nights prior.  I am a huge fan of Macaroni Grill and enjoyed my dining experience at the other locations.  Sadly, I will not be returning to this particular location. 

I am not sure if the terrible service was due to a couple (male and female) table next to us which appeared to be someone from the corporate offices.  Basically said table was lecturing the MOD and staff on ways to improve. I thought it was hilarious because the wait staff that was tending to our table were no where to be found and we were there for well Over an hour! Keep in mind there were ( yes I actually counted) 17 people dining for lunch and approximately 10 wait staff. Regardless the service was horrible and the food was okay :( sad because I had set my heart on eating the butter lettuce salad! It really is delicious and I highly recommend it. Unfortunately this time my salad was missing the onions and cheese :( The appetizer meatballs are yummy!!! Be warned it is on the spicy side.  I highly recommend this appetizer and only this appetizer. The truffle macaroni was chalky and so was the fondue which was also skimpy on the prosciutto (one strip). 

Overall my expectations were very high at this location because of my previous experience.  I will for sure be going back to macaroni grill but maybe not this location.  Well not this location anytime soon :)"}
{"text":"first time trying and was not happy service was great but the food was horrible dirty plate when food was served chicken tastes like rubber pasta wasn't even cooked completely... Area was dirty crayons on the shelf and on the table, took my food to go and threw it away.... Big disappointment..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Romano's;
the location on Stephanie made a good
impression.
The hostess and server were attentive,
the service was prompt, and the pace of
the meal was perfect.  The quality, taste,
and temperature of the food was excellent.
There was an open kitchen and the entire
staff seemed friendly.  The music was
unobtrusive and the atmosphere was nice
for couples.
The biggest negative was that the dining
room was too cold.  Also, my spouse felt
the bread was too salty, but I thought it
was good."}
{"text":"I have had several curbside pick ups from here. Super smooth process. No problems. Always friendly. 

The food is good. Not crazy good but always just really good. I like the chicken parm, lasagna, and chicken under a brick. 

Always a clean plate from me with this fare."}
{"text":"Wa Wa Wa... I have to close, I am the only closer.   This service here would have to suck to be better.  Showed up at 8:45 pm.  Took them 3 minutes to figure out where to put me in a 80 % empty joint.

Figured out what I wanted before waiter showed up.. about another 5 minutes, glass of wine and simple chicken dish with house salad and water.

5 minutes later got the wine,(got to see manager speaking to the floor team while I waited).  Wine glass was wet when it showed up... dripping water.  But no water,  5 to 10 min later the house ceaser showed up.  Still no water, had to ask what was suppose to go with the plate of olive oil.  Finished salad chicken dish showed up warm and the dollop of cheese on the pasta was still firm and not melting.  Sent it back at that time I said screw it and thru down a 20 and left.  Not a word as I walked by my waiter and the manager.  Food in this area sucks.  Read my other review of TGIF... it seems that one should not eat in north charlotte."}
{"text":"We have always been big Macaroni Grill fans as it is quick and good enough when you want family dining, don't have a reservation for fine dining and they have something to please anyone. We have dined at MG in different parts of the country but probably been to this particular location 10 times. We visited Sunday and it will be our LAST. We went for early dinner (4PM) so there was no one there. Our party was 2 adults, 2 kids. We ordered meals and dinner salads. After ordering, we waited 20 minutes before I got up to ask if the waitress could bring our salads. We could see her going from the kitchen to the bar but never back in the dining room. Here response when I walked to the bar was \"the chef is working on them\"... it was another 8-10 minutes before we had salads. About 10 minutes later, the waitress brought 1 kids meal - burnt to a crisp chicken fingers that looked like they should not have been served. SO one of our kids was served while the other waited... and waited and waited. Then he got his spaghetti. Another 10 minutes passed and we got our meals. The food was ok but the whole experience was so poor we just wanted out. It took 90 minutes to eat with two 9-yr old boys. We had no drinks, aps or dessert - that is crazy. Never going back!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry guys, if it had not been a short notice trip to Petsmart we would not have had to endure this pain, misery and yuk that was presented to us..

In no particular order, some points to consider if you are thinking to eat here..
The hostess kept pushing all customers to the rear of the restaurant and was not prepared to let us sit somewhere quite..

Wine served in a water tumbler - \"tis the italian way said our waiter\" - total b*ll S*it said I.

Mushroom soup that was a dark coco color and no mushrooms

A chicken breast which was in fact small cubed portions still with skin and swimming in old oil
and..... wait for it, a gentleman who we assumed to be the manager but would not share his role, going around the tables checking on our thoughts - he never stayed long enough to listen and disappeared when we we leaving .

My wife only ate less than 30% of her food and some 2 hrs later to all came back up...

After all this this place deserves an award, as the worst place to eat in Scottsdale/Phoenix October 2014"}
{"text":"I used to like this place... 
Went in for a quick lunch around 1:00pm. We sat in the bar (I like to avoid screaming children). 
Our server was friendly and he is the only reason this place is getting two stars. 
The bread arrived screaming hot and lovely. 
I ordered the warm spinach salad which was supposed to be spinach, roasted garlic, prosciutto, lemon, olive oil and topped with toasted goat cheese. (sounds good right?) 
My friend ordered the half sandwich and salad combo. 
It took OVER 35 minutes for our salads to arrive! Really?? 
When I saw mine I actually laughed. It was a pile of spinach with a cold, greasy half breaded medallion of goat cheese with one clove of garlic and a small mushy ball of prosciutto. It tasted like dishwater. 
The server never checked on us and I had to go find him. He took the salad and offered me something else. 
I got the Mozzarella Alla Caprese. Cant screw that up right... 
The tomatoes were so hard and pink they were borderline inedible. They were topped with one basil leaf and half of a mini mozzarella ball. It sucked. 
I'm done with this place. If you go, have the bread and leave!"}
{"text":"Went back to see if the first time was a fluke and to see if the other reviews were right, but again we had AWESOME service! We had Joe this time and he was just as attentive as Cody was. Cody even recognized us and said hi! The waiters here are very fun and quick to serve us. I don't know why there are so many bad reviews because both experiences we have had here were great on all levels! Food service and ambience were all great!!!"}
{"text":"took my daughter for her bday. to start off the bread wasnt sliced and was salty, rigatonys bread is way better.  the appetizer was very good stuffed mushrooms with crab.  the food is very pricey but worth it compared to the portions they serve you, one portion can serve my entirely family. the pasta is imported which makes a big difference to me. I got a pasta with mushroom chicken and garlic sauce which was excellent. I would go back."}
{"text":"My family and I really love Macaroni Grill. The 6 of us have gone frequently in the past few years with great food and amazing service. 
Tonight the service was severely lacking. It took our waitress a good 5-10 minutes to take our drink order and another 5 after that to get the drinks. She almost forgot to take the entree order of one of us and there were always dishes on the table. Salad bowls when the entrees came, and entree dishes when dessert came which took another 15 minutes to receive. Drinks were empty a lot and when my mom was trying to take a drink out of her empty coke the waitress came up behind her with a new one saying \"Hold on, I'm coming!!\" 
Overall, food was still amazing but service was horrible. Maybe go for take out or sit at the bar. Avoid the front of house staff and much as possible and you'll be great."}
{"text":"I know, I know, this is a chain but it's good and they got it right!
Great food, they have some lighter options for ya'll that are interested in the calories. Great bread and olive oil. Service has been consistently good.  It's spot is a family favorite."}
{"text":"Food was good, not crazy delicious. HOWEVER, Lamad (the bartender) was our waiter and this guy was awesome! Me and my friends enjoyed his impeccable service, professionalism & just awesome enthusiasm. He made us feel so at home! This was all our first times at Macaroni Grill and we just wanna come back because we had excellent customer service! Everything felt natural and just good vibes all around. Thank you, Lamad! Keep doing what you're doing because you are an unexpected delight and your spirit just lights the room up! You are blessing to those you come across and you set an example to the kind of restaurant experience I always want. 

The food was alright and the cheese balls were a hit!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? The stench outside greets you with a warning: turn back! We didn't listen. We were first seated (with our three year old) at a floor table in the middle of a busy walkway. Obviously the young lady doesn't have kids. No high chair and busy walkway spell trouble. We asked for a booth. There were about 3 open booths that needed bussing. She acted like it was a heavy ask but begrudgingly cleared a booth. Pro tip: do NOT sit in the East side of the restaurant as it smells exactly like the stench from outside. Imagine......over cooked fettuccini with a side of decomposing body. Our server was less than mediocre and promptly forgot about us after bringing us our drinks. No, we didn't want refills...it's cool. Oh, and she overcharged our card by $30! This place is awful."}
{"text":"Came to have a family dinner and was a little disappointed by the food. We first ordered a flat bread and they didnt have any so was told theyd give us the kid pizza (same thing just different shape) then they came back and said they didnt have any of that either. So instead ordered Fettuccine Alfredo and tasted kinda plain , seemed a little dry and not much flavor. We did how ever fell in love with the stuffed mushrooms appetizers it said it had goat cheese sounds weird to some but they were amazing, an explosion of flavor with a little spice. Also the mushroom ravioli was good. The customer service was fantastic we were seated fast and was taken care of by Rochelle. She checked constantly if we needed more drinks , and she also sang very nice to hear. And last we tried a Tearamasu and WOW best ive tasted hear in vegas defiantly try it !"}
{"text":"My review is solely for the happy hour. It's my favorite spot for a quick after-work drink. They have $3 house wine, $3 draft beer, I believe $4 or $5 house cocktails, and $5 flatbreads. 

My advice, get the house wine. They know how to pour it (see my picture). They also offer the whole bottle of wine for $18 which is a deal as it is a double bottle. The food is tasty also."}
{"text":"Not a great place. Food wasn't good and service kind of sucked! Told the waiter that the food was horrible and all he said was, \"So You're Done?\". Will not go back!"}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in a long time. My grilled chicken breast was rubbery and had zero flavor, unless you want to count the dishwater taste. The pasta was only slightly better but still barely had any flavor that resembled food. Very disappointed, especially for the asinine prices.

Update 4/2/18: I spoke with April, the manager, who reached out to me regarding this review. She apologized for my experience and offered a complimentary entrée and dessert with no expiration. Updating my review from one to two stars for now."}
{"text":"absolute trash service. walked in, saw literally one person sitting at a table for dinner and assumed we'd be seated quickly. took around 5 minutes to be seated, not a huge deal considering they offered us a complementary dessert for our wait. 

my girlfriend and i both consistently ran low on drinks, despite the fact that our waitress continuously walked by us. at one point she went missing for well over 10 min and there was no other customers in the store. food was overall good, and that is the ONLY positive about this place saving it from a one star. a little on the pricier side for what you get i think ( i had the tortelacci so i am probably biased - $18 for a pretty small portion. my girlfriend has the \"trio\" of some kind and that portion to be fair was HUGE for the price of $11-12).  

finished dinner and waited 15 min or so for the check, discovered that they were added together and we wanted them split up so we requested that. took a few minutes which is fine, no big deal, but then i look down and the \"complementary\" tiramisu we had miraculously appeared on the check. 

won't be returning, would not recommend this place to anyone. spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"After the poor service at the Rainbow location we decided to use our gift certificate at the Sahara location. We got there early, just after 5 pm, and were seated promptly. We ordered the \"two for $9\" appetizer and they were brought just minutes apart. After finishing the appetizers but before the main course came I noticed something out of the corner of my left eye. I turned to see what it was and was astonished to see a cockroach crawling along the back of my booth seat! I grabbed my napkin and squished the roach. We called over the waiter who at first seemed to be apologizing for the slowness of the main course. I didn't want to raise my voice but he just wouldn't listen to me so I handed him the napkin and said, \"There's a cockroach I just killed in here. I need a new napkin.\" He took it away and a couple of minutes later the manager came over and apologized profusely, which would have been great except he said they had just sprayed \"last night\" to get rid of roaches. So not only was a roach crawling around our table but there was bug spray all over? 

Even though the restaurant wasn't that busy our waiter seemed to be. He complained to us that he had \"3 or 4\" large parties (I didn't see any table with more than 6 people). They were one cook short in the kitchen (overheard a waitress telling the table next to us). What should have been an hour meal took almost two hours. 

I did email Mac Grill and got a confirmation the next day (Oct 5th) and have not heard from anyone yet. The manager did comp one entree but you know I think we've had it with Romano's Macaroni Grill, at least here in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here mid-September. We used to live near San Francisco and often went to the Romano's Macaroni Grill in San Mateo. We like the food; it's pretty good for a chain. 

It was busy when we got there but we were seated fairly quickly. The whole problem for the night was the lousy, forgetful service. We ordered the \"two for $9\" appetizers and only one was delivered. When we asked for the second it finally came - after the main course. I expect the servers at Mac Grill to be friendly but I don't expect any serve to lean on his elbows on my table. It wasn't a satisfactory experience.

I emailed Mac Grill and got a nice response from the Area Manager, who offered $25 gift certificate. So a while later we went to the Sahara locations. Read my review of that location please."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely horrible. All of food was served and they never brought us utensils nor napkins. I like my water to get refilled and I drink a lot here in the desert. We only gave this place another chance because of the good coupons that they send in the mail."}
{"text":"Inconsistent food prep, service, drinks.  Like the atmoshpere but have given up on this place. Disappointed too many times."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch. Ordered the chicken Marsala.
Brought me water & olive oil, no bread for the oil.
Meal came, started cutting into the chicken had a bite or two then noticed the inside of the chicken was raw! It grossed me out immediately I spit out what i had in my mouth. Female Manager comes over asks if I want another dish, No thanks! OK no charge. I said for what I never even got the bread! Oh do you want some bread? To late for that! Ill let the chef know. What good does that do me? How about a gift card or something for ruining my meal & possibly poisoning me? No. I get up & leave. The manager comes out to the parking lot, we have coupons! I didn't even look back.
If you ruin somebody's meal & you want them back you got to win them back. They didn't come close.
I deem this place gross & possibly dangerous to your health! 
Poorly managed."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  Went on a Friday night and the place was half full (being kind). 

Service was nice, but slow.  Our waitress was covering several tables while several other employees stood and did nothing or gave the appearance of being busy.  

Food was bland, over cooked and luke warm - cold.  From the appetizer to the entrees, nothing was up to previous visits.

Would not recommend going back until something big changes.  Cooks?  Menu?  Managers?"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and consistent; especially for a large chain. This is a family favorite since its nearby and quick. Service is the only area that is lacking. Over the years, service has been very inconsistent. Usually servers are very forgetful of things. Missing silverware, missing pepper for foccai bread, missing items ordered, etc. Host/hostess has been very good. Bar area is decent on service, although usually short staffed when busy.

Kids love it so we keep coming back."}
{"text":"BUFFALO CHICKEN PARM is a goto choice.. always good after the goat cheese stuffed pompadew pepper appetizer with balsamic drizzle

But the LAMB CHOPS are the thing to get!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty, and our waiter, Chris, was very attentive.
Informed Chris, we didn't get our appetizer within minutes the head waiter came to our table and stated that he was sorry this happened, it should be out shortly and it was on the house. This is what I call good service. Thank you."}
{"text":"Terrible food.  Really greasy almost felt like eating a frozen dinner that was microwaved.  The waitress showed zero interest in being friendly..  This seems to be the normal for this place.  Still feeling the effects of the grease a day later."}
{"text":"Our server Sidney was incredible. We wanted new dishes that we had not tried before.  Ordered the penne rustica sub sauce for basil pesto and added more garlic.  Delicious.  Sidney was also attentive and on point.  Highly recommend! Had Todd the manager come over to le him know what a great experience we were having. He was pleasant and receptive. Could tell it was nice to have a good review."}
{"text":"Great place professional staff
Good food 
Its just decent everything else.  
I expect more flavor from Italian joint"}
{"text":"A manager got ahold of me for my bad experience there.  They sent me coupons that had covered my bill.  It took me awhile to work up to actually go back since last time was horrendous.  The service was better and so was the food. Me and my guest both got the chicken parmesan and it was tasty.  We weren't brave enough to try anything else out.  I may, if given no other choice, go back here and get the chicken parmesan."}
{"text":"Love it! Ask for the \"Create your own Pasta\" menu..Not on the menu. ....I like spicy with roasted tomatoes, chicken and grilled mushrooms!  Ask for \"extra souce\"!"}
{"text":"I can recommend for the quick grab lunch from their express menu which is very affordable $7. During weekdays you don't see much crowd and they got very spacious interiors ."}
{"text":"We organized a group lunch at Macaroni Grille for today. We had 18 people go.  We had made arrangements with the manager, Rob Webb, a few days ahead of time. He told us about the limited item menus that were available. The intention of the limited menu is to get food out to the group quickly and also to save $5-6 per person. They are a set price and include salad, non-alcoholic beverages and entree. Meals were served in a timely manner. Food was great. Our server, Maria, was excellent. We all had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there with my friend around 7pm on a Monday night , got seated right away. Waitress Chelsea was great and upbeat. Not many people in the restaurant. We both ordered Chicken Parmesean with Penne pasta and a side of Ceasar salad. Salad was fresh, crunchy with right amount of drsg, at least for both of us. Then the waitress brought our main meal of Chicken Parmesean and my friends looked great but mine looked like the luggage had shifted during the flight (Penne pasta was hiding under the chicken Parmesean and it all had shifted to one side of the plate. That's okay too no problem, I can work with that. After taking the first bite, realized that the pasta and chicken is dry and lacking sauce. The waitress was nice enough to bring us more sauce when we asked. Check out was quick, no lacking in service,  only drawback was food not being up to par and that's why taking the one star away. Hopefully on my next visit, I will be able to give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Well they changed their menu, no more salad with your meal unless you pay extra, so they got a new menu for evening dining, well what about us that like to eat earlier, oh I get it, they want new clientele, they want to get rid of us old ones.  Guess what it worked!!  Plus my Eggplant pasta had tooooooo much of something very hot and spicy and the eggplant was burnt around the edges.   So mark this one off the list for sure."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic as always. Got seated in seconds. And that's where it went down hill. Server didn't come around for almost 15 minutes had no personality. Food great service sucked."}
{"text":"I am generally not a fan of chain restaurants.  I have an even harsher view when it comes to Italian chain restaurants.  All that said....I dig the Macaroni Grill!  Before they came to Charlotte, I used to drive 45 minutes out of my way to eat with them....in Greenville, SC no less!"}
{"text":"I've been to this particular Macaroni Grill several times and enjoyed it and likely after any of those times I would have given it four stars rather than two.  I am, however, rating the restaurant on the last visit and that score is a generous two.

We were seated and told that the hostess had no idea who our waiter/waitress would be.  They were \"fighting over tables\" so we were wished good luck.  Turns out the hostess became our waitress and seriously she should have just stayed a hostess.  She was incredibly slow (there were only four tables filled and several waiters/waitresses, so I'm not sure what the holdup was) and at one point completely forgot that I had ordered a glass of wine even though she'd gone over to the bar right after I placed the order.  The food was decent, though nothing I'd write home about.  The only description I can give about the Penne Rustica was \"cheesy\".  Nothing really beyond that sticks out.  My husband found what looked to be a hair in his Carmela's Chicken and that pretty much did it for him.  Then when the bill came the waitress disappeared again and my credit card sat waiting for her to come back for about 15 minutes.  Finally, the manager took the bill and handled it.  The waitress never returned to our table.

Will I go back?  I don't know.  I have always enjoyed Macaroni Grill but the service and food, at least at the Goodyear location have kind of gone down hill."}
{"text":"My first time here, I'm waiting to be seated, so far the place looks nice. The decoration creates a warm fun atmosphere and I love how we can see the kitchen and the pizza oven! Übber cool!"}
{"text":"Took my puppy and sat out on the balcony it was really nice they took good care of me. My pizza was amazing and they e an brought the dog water."}
{"text":"Food was great, service lacked. We went at an odd time wasn't really dinner but wasn't lunch. Our server didn't seem happy we were sat in his section, he put on the best face he could. I did their three course lunch menu and it filled me up.! The complementary bread is so yummy! I had the rigatoni and sausage pasta so good! My boyfriend had a pizza and thoroughly enjoyed it. Everything was good, service wasn't bad but wasn't great!"}
{"text":"Wow, one of the worst experiences with customer service I have ever had that has officially turned me off this location and possibly the entire franchise. 

We were seated really quickly to a booth and then our waitress came over. I know it wasn't just me that felt this because my friend also felt the same way, but she totally came off like she didn't want to be there at all. I know most people don't want to be at their jobs but it isn't our fault as customers, and you need to earn your tips. She was just very off-putting. She tried to \"sell\" a lot of items to us literally right as we sat down but had no feeling behind them, just like she was being forced to talk up specials, etc. Don't get me wrong, I know it's a servers job to talk up their products, but have some tact. She was just listing things to buy and it became annoying quickly. She left for our drink orders and came back to give us our drinks and set up the olive oil and pepper for the bread that she hadn't brought out yet. She literally put 1/6 of a teaspoon on the plate with the pepper. Yes because I'm sure between two people we will only want a teeny tiny piece of bread and be done. 

Looking at the menu, it looks as if they have changed a lot - and not for the better. The prices have gone up and the options have gotten less and less. I got the sheet to do the make your own pasta and it looks as if they took away a lot of the options for mix-ins. After ordering our waitress tried to crack a joke/sell my friend salad by referring my meal as \"rabbit food\". Aaaaand Adina is pissed. 

Eventually she brings out the bread and a minute later brings out my \"rabbit food\", aka a caesar salad. Salad was fine, and actually a decent portion size. During this time their computers went down and our waitress asked my friend what she ordered again. It happens, but there was still something off-putting about how she asked. The entire meal just seemed to be... tense. 

We get our food, and wow. My portion size couldn't be smaller. I remember when I used to order MYO pasta where there was so much that I had to take 3/4 of it home. I ended up finishing all of it. It was good, but the toppings and add-ins were lacking and it was just a sad little bowl of pasta. Definitely not what I was expecting especially for $10. 

My friend and her daughter seemed to like their food, but it got to the point where I was at the end of my water. I sat it on the end of the table for almost 10 minutes before someone who WASN'T our waitress came by to refill it and also got us an extra order of bread. It is a very bad sign when you get all the way down to your water to the point of sipping annoyingly, and then still having to wait almost 10 minutes for a refill. It was still about 5 minutes after that when our waitress finally came over to ask how we were doing. She tried pushing dessert on us by just leaving a dessert card with us, but it wasn't even a push so much as, \"Yeah he's the desserts, whatever.\" Her attitude really came across like she did not care whatsoever which is why my tip reflected that I also did not care whatsoever. 

When the girl who fills water who you see for 2 minutes is the best part of the customer service for your entire night, something is wrong. Worst service I have ever had, I couldn't even really enjoy my meal because all I wanted to do was to get out of there and away from our waitress. It's sad that this Macaroni Grill has gone so downhill. The prices have skyrocketed, and the portions have gotten smaller. I don't think I will be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Tried to have a nice dinner with our parents and what a disaster this place turned out to be. We had a good friend that used to be the general manager at this location it used to be 5  and has since moved to another and what a disappointment  2 1/2 hours for a service for 4 on a Thursday night. The food was terrible and unfortunately our service was worse I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS LOCATION, we had a table next to us just walk out because they were so irritated."}
{"text":"Greg wonderful waiter.
There was 6 of us dining and all the dishes served were superb.
I miss those white gladioli that used to greet us by the reception area.
House red wine too sweet and blah. Macaroni grill should do better in their house wine."}
{"text":"Amazingly incredible too-slow to describe service. Food is average and the help is indifferent. Tough way to be in competitive market and survive. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Dined at this Macaroni Grill during my very brief stay in Cleveland.   We dined late in the evening so the restaurant was nearly empty. What stood out about this visit was the server - she was incredibly professional and should be working at a fine dining restaurant. 

Food was good and fresh.  I was glad to introduce my colleague to Macaroni Grill who lives in an area where they don't have Macaroni Grill - too bad because they are missing out."}
{"text":"Hello friends went to Macaroni Grill tonight and sadly it was just ok. Our waitress was terrific but the food was very bland.  The sauce was bland , The Cesar salad I ate was lame . As always don't take my word for it try it for yourself ! If you go let me know what you think"}
{"text":"Had dinner with the hub and kid and her friend. We arrived about 530 pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. The worst thing I can say is that it took over ten minutes to the servers attention. We were beginning to get frustrated with not receiving the wonderful bread the give everyone, or drinks. Finally our server took our drink and appetizer order, and eventually brought us the bread. From that point, she was great. Refills brought right before the glass was empty, checking on everything, and very friendly. I had the Calabrese Strip, mid rare with potatoes. I completely loved it. The whole thing was great. The hub ordered Chicken Marsala and was very happy. His only complaint was he wished for more sauce. But he loved the pasta so much that he even took home what he didn't finish. The girls had lasagna and Chicken Parm. The bottom of the lasagna was burnt, but the rest was fine. As usual, the kid loved the Chicken Parm. We all had Caesar salads, which were nothing special. We ordered the sampler as an appetizer. When it arrived, it seemed quite small. It included Brushetta,  fried mozzarella sticks and fried calamari. The kids snagged the mozzarella and devoured it. With two pieces of cheese and two pieces of bread for the Brushetta, it made for a small snack. The calamari was over cooked and chewy. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal, with a friendly server and great entrees. We will be back."}
{"text":"We were trying to figure out where to go for lunch and had recently received an offer for a $7 \"express\" lunch at Macaroni Grill. I hadn't been there in a few years, but my boyfriend remembered it as being one of his past favorites. We decided to give it a try.

We went on a weekday around 1pm. It wasn't super busy. The dining room was about half full, and there were a few people in front of us waiting to be seated. I should have know this wasn't going to be a good experience when I noticed some people being directed to a line on one side of the dining room where I saw a sign for the \"express\" lunch. I really wasn't in the mood to stand in line and order my food. That was one of the reasons we picked there to eat. It was our turn, and the hostess asked if we were going to do full service dining or the express dining. Since we were hungry, we decided we might as well go with it. 

We got to the register and ordered. There seemed to be some confusion regarding the Chicken Caesar Calzonetto when I orderd. The cashier said it wouldn't be ready in seven minutes. I questioned her since it was clearly stated that everything on the express menu was guaranteed in seven minutes or less. After a few minutes, she changed her mind and told me it was guaranteed. Huh? We paid and noticed she put our receipt in a drawer with others. I had to ask her for it. Thought it was a bit odd that we weren't asked if we wanted it and that there was no mention of the fact that the time we placed our order was on the receipt. This was deceptive in my book.

So, off we go to find a table. We were told we could sit anywhere. We found a table. Made a note of the time on our receipt and waited. Hmmmm.....No server. No silverware. No drinks. It's been five minutes and still nothing. Finally someone comes by and asks for our drink order. Our drinks are brought. At about eight miinutes after we ordered, one entree came out. We asked about the other one, and were told they bring them out seperately so they can meet the seven minute guarantee. The other one was brought at about ten minutes after. We realized at that point that we didn't have silverware. I vaguely remembered the cashier telling the people in front of us something about silverware. Off one of us goes to find it.

We also didn't realize we probably needed to order anything extra with our food. We each got a sandwich. Nothing comes with it. If you want chips, salad or a cookie, you have to order that. We were asked if we wanted bread when we ordered, which I thought was odd. I don't usually want bread with my meal when I've ordered a sandwich.

Everyone seemed stretched thin and it was never clear if we had a server or if it was just a group effort to make sure the \"express\" lunch people were taken care of. The server that brought the second sandwich told us that she would talk to the manager about a refund since the seven minute guarantee wasn't met. I will give her credit. Although she was busy, she did take the time to get back to us and even apologized that they didn't meet the time guarantee.  

Honestly, I didn't care that much about the seven minute thing until the cashier put the receipt in the drawer without even a mention. The whole experience was poor for what you would expect from a place like this. The food wasn't that good either. The chicken on the sandwith was good, but there was way to much wrap or bread. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm sandwich. It was bland. Tasted like it was breaded without seasoning. The \"express\" line was next to the kitchen and salad prep area. Every time a server needed to check on something they had to navigate the people standing in line.

This new format is ridiculous. Both the service and food suffer."}
{"text":"Stay Away!
I had two items: a Caesar salad, and a margherita pizza.
Caesar salad:
The outer leaves of the head, at the top, with brown edges.  Hacked into random too-large and too-small pieces.  With some of the stems that were turning translucent from being too old.  Overdressed.
Pizza:
Weird, bread-like crust.  And not bread-like in a good way.  With sauce that had no seasoning; I think it was just tomato sauce from a can (like hunt's).  The cheese was OK, the tomatoes were flavorless.  It was covered with chopped green herbs.  Basil, you think?  Hah: parsley!
The complimentary bread was good."}
{"text":"Took a 15 year hiatus from eating here due to an unpleasant experience. My husband and I decided to give it another shot last night. Not an inexpensive dinner for two, that was hands down the worst meal period! Will never return. My pasta had little or no flavor, pasta over cooked and his was so spicy that it was not edible. A waste of money and time...  food that went directly into the garbage bin after a couple bites."}
{"text":"I came here sometime last week and was pretty disappointed. The server Matt was very short and came off a bit rude at times like he didn't want to be there. I am mostly annoyed because I had left him a 5 dollar tip on a 10 dollar tab which seems more than fair.. then i check my bank statement and the posted payment was 17 dollars so It seems Matt was a but unhappy with his tip and decided to add some extra money to it. i'm guessing he probably does this often as most people would not notice this.. I will not be returning if this is how customers are treated"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I like Romano's, the ingredients are fresh and the Chianti is very good. My bride ordered a dish that included orzo,  fresh spinach and chicken, however there was no chicken and after a few bites she realized that her dish apparently was meatless. As for me, I ordered Carmella's chicken with rigatoni noodles and was amazed to find very little chicken in my dish as well. To pay $16 for this dish I would expect there to be a noticeable quantity of protein, if the meal starts with chicken as its primary ingredient then I would expect to see the chicken . Sadly I left hungry and very disappointed. We will return but I won't be ordering the above entree's anytime soon. Now if this is managements way of controlling costs by means of portion control, then this venue is doomed, because the buying public knows when they are getting their money's worth and when they don't. It's basic management."}
{"text":"I know that us Yelpers tend to poo poo on chain restaurants, but I legitimately like this place.  I've eaten here no less than 50 times in the 15 years I've been coming to the area on business, and I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal or an inattentive waitstaff experience. I've had about everything on the menu at one time or another, but my personal favorite is the Chicken Marsala with extra roasted garlic. If you are interested in something lighter, the Caesar salad with shrimp, scallops, or salmon is a great choice."}
{"text":"We hadn't tried Macaroni Grill in quite some time so we thought we'd give it another go. Fail.  

Maybe it was just our server, but the service was bad enough that I actually contacted Macaroni Grill through their website to complain about the service. I worked in a restaurant for well over 5 years so if anything, I'm overly patient in restaurants. We ordered our very simple meal before the table next to us but for some reason they were already done with their meal before we even got our appetizer. The server seemed to sense our displeasure.  However, rather than trying to rectify the situation, he just avoided our table altogether.Oh, and once we got our food is was pretty meh.

I did receive communication back from Macaroni Grill and they sent 5 $5 gift certificates in the mail. This is the only thing that saved this review from 1 star."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday evening...it was slow. Food was a bit bland..salad had to much feta cheese,..overall this wasn't a good experience. Not the macaroni grill of old...will not return."}
{"text":"The sole was very good, the butternut squash ravioli was pretty good. I'm downgrading them because they sort of forgot about us and we didn't get a menu for 25 minutes then it took 40 minutes to get get bread even though we told them that we were famished."}
{"text":"My 5 stars are for the service I received from Camal. He is by far a top notch genuinely nice guy. I belive he created little moments of magic with his knowledge of the menu to his personality and demeanor with me. I would definitely come back if everyone was as good as Camal. keep up the great service."}
{"text":"This is casual dining. The food is tasty. Our waiter, Rick, was really nice, friendly, and very helpful with suggestions about the menu. We had passed by this place for years wanting to go in, but afraid it would be too pricey. But this was very affordable. It was a nice experience. When you dine here, ask for Rick!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.

As I write I for the life of me cannot remember the name of what I ate.  It was a chicken and pasta dish.  Not bad.  I also ate a Cesar salad that was not bad either.

But what I do remember is that our waiter who was professionally friendly busted his ass.

I watched as he scrambled to take care of our table and several others with pep in his step and a smile.

OK food with great service."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with fellow yelpers Robyn N.,Masha Z.,Norm R.,Arlin B., Georgie M and Rand H. Well to start we had some bread brought to are table which was very good but was all gone by the time I got my chicken & mushroom cannolloni.They should have offered more bread when everyone one got there pasta or soup. (minus a star) food was not hot enough (oops there goes another one) service when we were done was very slow and I was still hungry (down to 2 stars) I will stop writing before they run out of stars. (will not return)."}
{"text":"We arrived as a large group on a Friday and it was not busy.  Service was decent and the meal- Shrimp portofino was hot in temperature.  The pasta tasted like it had been kept warm for a period of time.  Overall I think the dishes are overpriced since they are all a la carte. It was $15 for a made up dish, (t is usually seafood portofino) that included angel hair pasta, mushrooms, garlic, shrimp, spinach and pine nuts.  We did get nice warm rosemary bread, but I think a side should be included.  The flavor was good and if I were cryical I would recommend salt.  Cheese was offered, but at the point in the meal when  our friend's dish was half gone.  BTW, he still got some. If you want true Italian pasta I would not come here."}
{"text":"It appears that Macaroni Grill suffers from what a lot of chain restaurants seem to be suffering from lately: familiarity.  They start out fantastic, get a fan base, expand, and then decide to let things slide because they think people won't notice and will come again and again regardless. 

The first insult came a few years ago when they got rid of what was my favorite dish (farfalle al sugo bianco).  I asked a server about it the first time I noticed it missing from the menu.  They weren't sure why either because it was a guest favorite.  Huh.  First sign of decline: you get rid of one of your most popular dishes that make people want to return.  

I've noticed they've tried to mix up their menu from time to time, even trying specials/dishes that similar Italian restaurant chains are offering to try to get people to come in.  Second sign of decline: trying to be like everyone else instead of standing out on your own merit.

We were offered a free sample of their house wine.  It was good, but when we told our server that we didn't want to order a glass, she took our samples away before we could finish!  Wow.  No buyee, no drinkee.  

We tried their fried zucchini appetizer to start.  It was pretty bland.  I realize that zucchini doesn't have a lot of flavor.  But that's why you season it, to bring out its flavor.  I guess Macaroni Grill doesn't realize that, though.  Even the marinara dipping sauce tasted unseasoned.  If you want fried zucchini done right, you have to go to Leroy Fox.  

Thankfully, Macaroni Grill still makes delicious rosemary-flavored bread that they bring complimentary to the tables to dip in olive oil.  I remember when they used to pour the olive oil into a dish for you; I guess that's out, too.  Third sign of decline: no longer offering a service that you used to offer (and people remember).

Our dinners took FOREVER to come.  And the restaurant wasn't even that busy.  It was about 2/3 full at a maximum.  Fourth sign of decline: your dinners take longer than they should to arrive and there's no manager walking around the floor apologizing for the delay or trying to help/speed things up.  

I ordered their new Buffalo Chicken Parmesan as my entree.  It said it came with calabrian peppers, celery, a gorgonzola cream sauce and capellini pasta, which I changed to farfalle (bowties).  The chicken tasted decent, although not exceptional.  The pasta and cream sauce was a disappointment.  There were a couple of BIG chunks of crunchy celery in it (I would have sliced it thin if making this dish at home) and only 3 tiny slices of calabrian peppers (which wasn't nearly enough).  I found one chunk of gorgonzola cheese, where I think all the flavor was, because the rest was just a plain cream sauce with no distinct gorgonzola flavor.  If you want to know what a gorgonzola cream sauce should taste like, go to Hawthorne's Pizza for their sausage and gorgonzola pasta dish.  It is out of this world.  

Others in my dinner party were similarly disappointed with their entrees.  My partner ordered the Brick Chicken to try to order on the healthy side.  He said it was extremely greasy and not very flavorful.  Mission unaccomplished.  His daughter ordered the Parmesan-Crusted Chicken Salad which looked big and amazing when it was delivered, but later she wondered where the \"greens\" were that were promised in the description.  It looked like they used cabbage instead.  Seriously?  This isn't coleslaw.  It's a salad.  They ran out and someone couldn't run over to the grocery store?  Lame.  Fifth sign of decline: running out of ingredients and substituting with something completely different, hoping the customer won't notice.  

After waiting too long for our dinners, we then waited for too long to have our dishes cleared, boxes for leftovers, and the check.  We were just ready to go.  

Macaroni Grill used to be my go-to Italian restaurant.  I can safely say that it is no longer even on our list of options for the future.  I have to break up with them.  It's not me, it's you."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there's so many negative reviews for this restaurant, but it's probably one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the area. I have been here countless times, and I do agree that the quality of the food does vary, but the bread is always amazing. I would come here just for the free bread. The bread is always baked fresh and paired with the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and pepper, it's amazing. My favorite entree that I order almost everytime is the Penne Rustica. It's roasted chicken, shrimp, rosemary cream, prosciutto, and parmesan with penne pasta. It's seriously my favorite pasta dish ever. On some of their off-days, it's true that the shrimp or chicken will be a bit dry, but when they cook it very well, it's to die for. So although there are only a few dishes on their menu that I like, I will come here just for that. So definitely give this restaurant a chance, and order that entree. You will be amazed."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my best friend. We were sat pretty quickly. Our waitress came right away and took our drink orders. She brought us some square bread which was very flavorful. I added some butter to just make it absolutely delicious! When I looked at the menu, I was really hoping they had more macaroni choices, being the macaroni grill! We both decided on the chicken Alfredo and my daughter ordered the pepperoni pizza. 

Our food came out pretty quick! It was yummy. Even my daughters pizza was good! The only thing I would change is the amount of chicken they give you with the Alfredo. You are paying $3 extra for chicken, you think they would be a bit more generous. Besides that, the waitress was very sweet and the food was yummy. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The food was good and that was about it.... When you go into a restaurant you would expect to receive the same service as others.
When we got there we were taken to a table and waited around 15 minutes before we finally flagged down a guy who introduced himself as Rich; he took our drink order as well as food and said that fresh bread was going to be right out.Our food came out about 10 minutes later and the guy with the cheese could hardly hold the cheese grater up let alone actually grate it. At this point we saw him carry bread to 5 different other tables and not once acknowledge our table. We were done with our meal and had to flag him down once again for our check. With the overall service experience I don't think the food is even worth the hassle."}
{"text":"I'm staying near the Desert Ridge area for about a month and have been here twice. However, after the last experience, I think it will be a while since I come here again or recommend this place to friends.

The first time I came here was around lunch time since we were at Desert Ridge and looking for a bite to eat.  We ordered a combo of appetizers and entrees.

Mac & Cheese Bites with Truffle Dip - it is okay, just little balls of mac and cheese that is later fried. When you bite into it, it is airy and there isn't a whole lot of taste to it.

Zucchini Fritti with Truffle Dip - I wouldn't recommend this appetizer again unless they keep an eye on how long they fry the zucchini.  The idea sounds good, long strips of zucchini that is fried almost like thin strips of chips, however, what came out was less than desired.  Most of what was on our plate was over fried. I don't mean \"golden brown\" either, but like dark brown, inedible pieces.  We didn't complain to the waiter but he must've seen that most of the plate was untouched.

Penne Rustica - roasted chicken, shrimp, rosemary cream, prosciutto, parmesan. This was alright, I thought the pasta was a bit overcooked and not al dente, but it wasn't mushy either.

Sweet Corn & Clam Fettuccine- clams, pancetta, celery, cream, white wine, green onion.  My friend ordered this and substituted with penne pasta instead. She seemed to like it although found it to be a bit too heavy as she got to the end of the dish.

Service was fine on our first visit.

Then about two weeks later I took my aunt/uncle who were visiting from out of town. We decided to stop here for a late lunch. It was around 1:45 pm by now.
When we entered, most of the dining area was empty with the exception of two small tables that had people who were eating. The annoying part of this was that we waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came by to actually seat us, we basically gone unnoticed and there was 3 of us with 2 more on their way. I had to approach someone to mention we would like to be seated. If we didn't already arrange to meet my aunt and uncle to meet us there already, I would've left the restaurant and gone elsewhere. 
 
We ordered a few appetizers to share, and I mentioned to our table not to order the zucchini fritti after last time's bad experience.

Calamari Fritti - fried calamari was actually pretty good. The batter was light and there was a fair amount of calmari to share.
 
Lobster-Stuffed Clams- clams, pancetta, garlic breadcrumbs, red pepper aioli. This was a disappointing item. It sounded good from the description, but the clams were tiny, couldn't find much (if any lobster) and you tasted more breadcrumbs than anything else.

Shrimp Portofino - jumbo shrimp, capellini, spinach, mushrooms, pine nuts, lemon butter. This this was fine, perhaps a bit too much oil for my taste.
 
The rest of the group ordered the combo lunch specials and then another ordered the sweet corn & clam fettuccine. 

The service this time wasn't very good. Yes, she came to get our drinks when we first sat down, but we had to flag her down to take our orders and also to get us some more bread and refill our drinks midway.  Mind you, this place had a total of 3 tables including us and there were a few waitstaff working that day.  Paying for the bill took forever as well.

Overall, the food isn't terrible here but there are some dishes better than others. Service I wish would be more consistent."}
{"text":"The worst service ever from a RMG!  The Bibb & Blue salad that is normally filled with bliss was flat tasting.  Never to return."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss and after my last experience I'm thinking it will be a miss for a while. I have stopped by several times since they introduced the \"express lunch service\" where when you order from the express menu you get your order in 7 minutes or less for $7. Each time I went in for lunch the manager gave me a BOGO coupon and said that even after it was expired that he'd still honor it. Sounds nice but I'm sure it's because the location is hurting. Inside there has either been nobody dining inside or maybe 2 table with customers while i\"m waiting for my order. The only thing I have had that's been worth it is a sausage and rigatoni dish. It's a good portion and tastes decent but a lot of the other menu items have been terrible and not worth the $7 let alone anything higher. I got a bit sick after eating the caprese sandwich as well the pulled pork sandwich. They will give you a free loaf of bread and some oils to go but you will have to ask for it to guarantee getting it."}
{"text":"CHAIN,CHAIN,CHAAAIIINNN, Chain of fools, that's me at the top of that chain! 
 I know better than to go to chains but some are good and this is close to home.

Beginnings, I asked waitress about something on the menu and she replied with she didn't know the menu that well??? 

Bread bomb they served was stale.

Salad with my entree came as.a shallow salad, barely cresting an inch from bottom of bowl! COME ON!  ($3.00) extra too!

Entree: $ 15.00  Shrimp with spinach & mushrooms in a lemon butter sauce. I was delivered a snarled blob of Pasta in a oil/sauce (I didn't taste any butter or lemon for that matter just a fattening tasteless conductor of lube/oil to help me swallow a bite. There was maybe 4 chards of spinach tangled in the  pasta and about 2 tablespoons of mushrooms in it, all for 15 dollars!!! Oh and I did get my shrimp but they were overcooked.

Value :ZERO,,,This is pasta for God sake, you'd think they might throw in a little extra spinach or mushrooms to go with it and actually use butter like they claim.
 Oh No,,they are in the back  with their weights and measures making certain no one gets an extra mushroom or spinach chard all the while balancing the books making sure their profits aren't marginal!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch after a meeting at the Indian's training facility.  I ordered
The chicken marsala for my meal.  It was good.  The fresh bread they brought was tasty too.  I know how to make chicken marsala plus a bunch of other Italian dishes and the Macaroni Grill does a good job of making it.   I like this place and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say BRAVO Macaroni Grill. My family and I went out for a last minute dinner yesterday. We were pleasantly surprised with a Kids Eat Free Monday and Tuesday. To top it off they were offering face painting and balloons. The kids were over joyed! Kudos to Josh; the server with a broken foot, that made my girls look so cute with his face painting designs. The staff and managers were attentive and friendly. What a great night! Food was tasty and HOT. Five star night!"}
{"text":"i've never been a fan. i remember going here back in the day and being annoyed when the singer would come sing to the tables. it's not my thing. 
however, Danielle and i had dinner at MG on Sunday and it was pretty good. the service wasn't terribly great but it wasn't awful.
Danielle had the Chicken Caprese and wished for more mozzarella. i had the Chicken Carmela and was pleasantly surprised, though i thought the chicken itself was no better than the stuff i can get pre-sliced in the freezer section of the grocer. the sauce was really good and i'd definitely eat it again."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, mother, and I decided to revisit Macaroni Grille after an absence of two or three years, because of several mediocre to bad experiences. We were excited to go back, confident they would have improved and we would have a good meal. We arrived later than usual (7:30 pm) on a weeknight, but they were still open and had a smattering of diners. Our waitress, Lynette was personable and prompt at first, bringing us small water glasses and a carafe with the menus, then following it with a loaf of bread and oil with ground pepper. (I always thought it was a mixture of fresh ground herbs that the server added to the oil--nope! Just pepper.) I was disappointed in the bread--cold and dry. We asked for another loaf, hoping for a fresh one, but more of the same bland disappointment. It was \"too late\" for good bread, I guess. She gave us very little oil, but left the bottle on the table, and was very light on the pepper. I asked for more and she ground two more twists. I just added pepper from the shaker. Salads were delivered just minutes after we gave our order and they were delicious (all Caesar). Our main dishes were prompt to our table, as well. The breaded sole was beautifully presented and a generous portion, though a little heavy on the butter, still delicious. The rice pilaf was unremarkable, but complemented the sole nicely. The rest of our party ordered Pasta Milano, one added pine nuts. It was difficult to discern which dish had the added pine nuts, since the addition was so small. When the dishes were delivered, no fresh grated Parmesan was offered. We requested it from Lynette and after a false start of an empty grater, we were able to top off our dishes with the cheese. The Pasta Milano was unremarkable. The mushrooms were not sautéed well...they were stiff and almost crunchy, as if they were just coated in the olive oil/butter mixture in the pan and added to the dish. I didn't feel like the sauce had matured, either. One in our party ordered coffee and our server never checked to see if she needed more. We had to remind her for a refill and both cups were strong and bitter. We placed a to go order that was delivered promptly, but without any bread. I had to ask for a loaf and she brought two. We had asked for separate checks when we ordered and she said to remind her if she forgot at the end of the meal. (I thought that was odd.) When the bill came, she had indeed forgotten the separate bill request. It took five minutes to get her attention and change the bill. I was disappointed in our evening out. The company and conversation was wonderful, but the food and some of the service was well below par. We will be frequenting other establishments from now on."}
{"text":"Terrible service, no customers. I could only smell apathy from the kitchen. Not what it once was."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at this RMG location.  The service was quick and friendly.  I also discovered that I REALLY like their Bibb & Blue salad containing bibb leaves, blue cheese, pancetta, walnuts, pickled red onions, buttermilk dressing.  It sucks that I quit consuming wheat flower because I sucks not being able to eat their tasty bread."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite wonderful happy hour specially with the shopping time of the year I really enjoyed it"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to eat, quick, a great atmosphere.  This is a step above Olive Garden, but just below Carraba's.

Air conditioning would have been great though.

Our server was Rhonda, she was very helpful and informative.  She knew everything on the menu really well.

We had the bruschetta, two glasses of wine, the lasagna, and the spaghetti with meatballs, the total came to $47"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices during the week. Love the pizza and rimmed red wine glasses. Add two salads. Dinner for two for under $20."}
{"text":"We came here on a gift card, thank god!  the food is terrible, as if they are trying to cut costs with cheap product.  Service is good, food is a mess."}
{"text":"Have taken my family here a few times and I've not had a bad experience!

Staff are friendly, food is fresh, portions are great, and they're always changing it up!

Favorite dish would have to be the Warm Spinach Salad substituted with Grilled Salmon! Special on appetizers is 2 for $9, so we'll get the Zucchini Fritti (which used to be be thinner) and Meatballs! 

Lots of steak/chicken/seafood entrees and pasta items to choose from! They have a great wine list too! 

Forever a fan!"}
{"text":"I don't know why my Mom wanted to come back here.  Their service is really slow & the food is mediocre.  We came twice in a Sunday with our family of 10-12 both times.  One of them was Mother's Day.  (Their table/set up & back room area works out well for my Elderly Dad in a wheel chair.)

It is beyond me how a large corporate chain can have such bad service!!  Our server was super sweet but our table of 10 was too much for her.  

(We eat out at restaurants 5-6 times a week and know good service.)

They need bus boys to help the servers.  They also apparently need managers that know how to run a restaurant.  Our server didn't get ANY HELP BRINGING OUT our food for 10 PEOPLE!!!!   SHE BROUGHT THEM OUT 2 AT A TIME & VERY SLOWLY!  I got my food last and the first people were done eating already.  

I never even saw a manager around.  They never came by to see how our meal was going -- most restaurants have a manager come by for larger parties.  

BOTH VISITS THEY MESSED UP RUNNING THE CARDS.  In April, the waiter ran my card for the whole bill on my card (when we had written out how much to put on 4 cards).   They reversed the charge that day, but they NEVER TOLD ME they ran it & it TOOK 3 days to get the $300 credit back from the bank!!  

The reviews at all locations are low.  The chain needs a major over-haul before they go out of business!!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I came here for a date night, never having been to a Maccaroni Grill we didn't know what to expect since most of them closed down in MN. Now we know why.

We arrived and were taken to our seats where we sat waiting about 15 minutes for the waitress to even come see us. When she did she asked if we wanted to try the house red. I said yes, since it was only $6 so why not. She proceeded to pour it in a regular juice glass! What? This is wine not tang. Lol. Whatever though.

Shortly after another waiter brought us the bread which was probably the best part of the meal. We cut and ate through almost all of it before she came over with their vinaigrette to try on the bread which was gone. Too little too late.

Finally our food arrived and the person who brought it out put the cheese on my Penne Rustica and also into my water glass and walked away. 5 minutes later our waitress comes out with the cheese grater asking if we'd like cheese on our food. Very strange.

My wife got their Chicken under Brick which she said was okay but the potatoes looked iffy and I'll eat just about anything in potato form. My Penne Rustica was inedible. It tasted like nothing but char and I normally love a little char flavor but this was BAD. The chicken in it was slimy and the shrimp tasted like it had gone bad. I just wanted to get out of there so we paid our bill and left. I had to chew multiple sticks of gum to get that flavor out of my mouth.

I will eat damn near anything if you put it in front of my face but it will never be Maccaroni Grill ever again."}
{"text":"The Steak Chianti (red wine sause) with pasta was the bizomb!! The bread was the best. Also get a strawberry lemondae..I cant wait to eat their again..yummy in my tummy"}
{"text":"This is the best Mac grill I have been to. I have been to several around the country. Dan is an outstanding waiter. Ask for him!"}
{"text":"Good place to have lunch or dinner I love it
The express lunch is a good option and is cheap"}
{"text":"Ulgh. We knew better. But we had a gift card. How can you resist $25 off your meal, right?

It was a Saturday night, peak dinner time. The place was packed. Well, it must not have been *too* full, as we were immediately seated. But it certainly felt jammed. That was probably due to the fact that they crammed about 500 tables in the space the size of a Starbucks. To boot, those table were stocked with crying babies. Lots of crying babies.

I felt kind of bad for our server, who was a big girl. She could barely get through the back to back chairs in order to reach our table. However, during the course of dinner, my sympathy waned, as I realized she sucked as a server. I can't stand having to look at empty dirty plates, and we had to do that a lot. I was also thirsty a lot. 

Now the food... wow, the food. OK, it started well enough, kind of. First, we got a really yummy loaf of rosemary-laced bread, served with EVOO and cracked pepper. That's it. No balsamic or herbs or salt. That would've been fine, if they olive oil was fantastic. But it wasn't.

The blah oil set the tone for the rest of the meal. Blah, blah, blah. The only flavor in any dish, was a hint of butter. Everything was dreadfully underseasoned. My lobster ravioli primarily tasted of the spinach pasta that surrounded it. It could've really used some garlic, salt, and some herbs. 

The whole meal was completely underwhelming, and I was resentful for having spent *any* money on it. Damn you, gift card."}
{"text":"So I get to go from here occasionally on my way home.... I order at the bar and have some wine while I wait with a nice male bartender.  No issues.  However, this last time I was told by the female bartender that I had to place my order at the to go counter.  Well that's fine I guess.  However, the poor to go girl is swamped.  It took 15 minutes for me to place my order.  The whole time I am standing there I make eye contact with multiple servers and two managers.   No one comes to this poor girls rescue.  The phone is ringing.  She doesn't have change.  And no help.  When I get back from placing my order... My bartender is indifferent... \"Got it all figured out?\" She asked.... It's too bad the staff is so apathetic about the convenience of their guests.   The servers here are 100% independent contractors.   Work on the team building and they will give great service overall!  Consistent food, uninvolved managers."}
{"text":"If you want cheap, yummy pasta, come here. The food is pretty good, although often times over salted. Wait staff is nice and inviting. Been here a few times when we've had gift cards. Otherwise, just cook 99c pasta bag at home."}
{"text":"I would avoid this particular chain location, I should have known this was not going to be a good dinner when my simple martini came to me without \"blue cheese olives\". I asked the waiter to get them, but he returned with none saying they were out. How does this happen, it's not like it was a special drink that they had a run on. The booth seats we were in are far beyond their life, very uncomfortable. The table had a huge lean as well, then o noticed all the back booths were like that!  To the point of your drink is tilting sideways. Oil on the plate will run to the edge bad. So we ordered apps, which tasted different from previous times and even looked different. I ordered blackened chicken parmigiana which took forever to come, and it came with a rubbery texture absent of any desired flavor. It's obvious it say and they reheated it. My wife's meal came 5 minutes later, nothing like eating together. I sent my meal back it was so bad, something I haven't done in 20 years!  The server was nice, and apologized for the short staff service. It took the manager a while to come by, another sign of a poorly running establishment. I won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Hosted a dinner for a medium sized party here.

The manager and staff did a great job getting everyone their drinks and food.  

Noteworthy was the follow through on expediting meals for several guests who had to leave shortly for the airport.

I am giving three stars for the food and a bonus star for the efficient and friendly management and staff."}
{"text":"The server was just amazingly funny! Very good service. Food and dessert was amazing! The homemade chocolate cake is a must get here."}
{"text":"I really like the menu choices and the food always tastes good, but they really need to lay off of the cross selling and up selling here. First the hostess, then our server took turns telling us about how awesome the (expensive) specials were, then went on to tell us about the spendy wine choices.....hey, you can take the bottle home with you.
The final straw came when she brought the check and asked us if we would like to buy a ticket to a charity of some kind.
My point is, not everyone wants a sales pitch as soon as their butt hits the seat...next time we'll go to Carraba's or Babo...no sales pitch there!"}
{"text":"Went there after a great night of watching my daughter sing at UNLV. Then everthing went wrong. Out of menu items, mushy food, fishy fish, etc. Last visit there was 5 years ago, next visit ............ 10 years? Wish they could get it right."}
{"text":"I use to love coming here for Brunch...it was close to our house & the food use to be good. But today I don't know what happened. Had my mouth all watered for the Nutella French Toast and Americano Breakfast...but unfortunately the chef wasn't on their \"A\"game today. It wasn't busy in here, which its rarely ever...it was my Mother & I with about 6 other tables all with 2-3 people on average. Our waitress Asia was Great & accommodating. And she too noticed our food not prepared in a matter of excellence. My Americano had an extremely small portion of potatoes, and 1 strip of bacon was missing plus it was served cooler in temp then it should have been. A gentleman came to our table apologizing for the inexperienced new chef who was later told to us had been here for 5 years. Its sad to have to complain especially when they are preparing ur food but I can't pay for something I can't eat. It has to be a fair exchange for quality. Service great! Quality unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Shame on you Macaroni Grill! I ordered a \"Create Your Own Pasta\" dish for take out and was horrified when I got home. My $14 pasta (which included chicken for an extra $3.50) consisted of one small chunk of chicken the size of a nickel and approx. 15 noodles. There was virtually no sign of the sauce or veggies I had requested. What a horrible waste of money."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because of my satisfaction with this Ramono's at Desert Ridge in the North Scottsdale area. Specifically for our server, Maria.

My lady and I have a date night or two every month at Desert Ridge. Well, from the first time we had Maria as our server, we absolutely adored her. She's such a genuinely kind and sweet person and a wonderful server. We typically ask for a couple of specialties (being difficult), but she's always on it with no complaints. The open atmosphere with the kitchen and dinning room makes her calling out our order directly with the chefs and cooks (in what feels like traditional Italian fashion) feel like a home cooked meal. It's definitely part of the ambiance we love. 

Next time you're out and about the Desert Ridge area and decide on Italian food, come to Romano's and ask for Maria. They're open pretty late and she's usually there!"}
{"text":"Wow, Macaroni Grill has gone so far downhill I don't know what to say. My husband and I hadn't been in a quite a while and decided to give it a try due to the wait at another restaurant. The food was awful! I got a healthy option chicken dish. The chicken was clearly frozen and reheated. I have had Lean Cuisines that were better. My husband ordered a steak and broccoli dish. The broccoli looked as if it was it had gone through a lawn mower and the overall dish was very sub par.

Our waitress, although friendly, was clearly on her first day or two on the job and couldn't answer any questions we had about the dishes or drinks. I ordered a specialty martini and the waitress was really struggling to carry it and although she was giving it extreme concentration was spilling it while walking and on the table.

The overall atmosphere was that of a retirement center dining room. 

Very sad, I used to really like Macaroni Grill, but after this experience, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I remember back in the day when Macaroni Grill was awesome. A step higher than Olive Garden with a surprisingly solid house wine. It was an easy go-to group dinner option. But when we popped in for a recent Sunday night visit, they were totally dead. Like two tables total kind of dead.  It was sad to see.

But once we got our food, it kind of made sense. The bread was fine but we didn't have much of it. The calamari appetizer was dripping in grease. Chicken Parmesan entree was burned and hard on the edges. When you don't even have a double-digit number of diners, it's hard to understand how a professional kitchen can be turning out food with basic execution issues. We've had better experiences with the location on N. Rainbow, and they usually look busy."}
{"text":"We love Romano's Macaroni Grill. We had a gift card so we used it while in vacation in Scottsdale. Our server was friendly and prompt. She recommended the bruschetta appetizer and it was delicious! We were seated immediately as we visited during an off time between regular meals. This Romano's was in a nice location as was large and modern. We brought back many leftovers for a late dinner back at the hotel."}
{"text":"Our first visit was because we had received a gift card for the restaurant. Because of negative reviews we were very leery but to our surprise loved the place, the service and the food. We just went back again and it was just as good as the previous visit.  We had a different server and she was just as pleasant and efficient as our previous server.  I hope people who have visited and loved this place do reviews too.  I know that usually it's only people who aren't happy that write reviews and I want this restaurant to get the credit it deserves.  I've had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken salad and my husband had the Chicken Scallopini.  Both were great dishes.  Their bread is fantastic and we love the saucer of oil and seasoning for us to dip our bread."}
{"text":"Like they always say if I could leave zero stars I would!  Was there recently on a weeknight ordered a truffle macaroni and cheese there were zero truffles on it and it was placed on our table at room temperature we asked to send it back when it was returned to me it was clearly reheated to the point of the cheese turning into oil... The bread was good but let's face it you don't go to macaroni grill for bread!
My husband had eggplant Parmesan it was just OK lacking in sauce.  Bottom line when in the Las Vegas area there are just too many good restaurants to eat crap definitely will not be back!"}
{"text":"Service was good but I didn't like the food. Maybe made bad choices, both salad and pasta were too salty, so I couldn't eat either. It was $45 mistake, as Oyster Bar had huge line, so I ended up here across the street. Should have red review first, also place was almost empty when I came in ..."}
{"text":"Very interesting experience... 
My mother and I came in for lunch and a female waitress came to seat us. As she walked us to our table she stopped to help another table and just pointed at the table we were supposed to sit at while she was helping the other table. Very rude. 

Next we waited about 15 minutes without our server even introducing themselves, however several servers stared at us and noticed we were there. Finally our server comes to the table and seems to be all over the place. She takes our drink order and brings out our bread and drinks but doesn't bring any silverware. 

Finally she comes to take our order and we ask her if we can use the coupon on the lunch special, we didn't know because the coupon doesn't specify. She asks her manager and she says we can. While she's taking our order she is also talking to two other servers and not really paying attention to us. 

She brings us our salads and when she puts cheese on the salad she asks us to say when to stop. I'm waiting to get the right amount of cheese on the salad and she stops without me saying when. She walks away without giving us silverware. Wait another five minutes to ask for silverware. 

Our food comes out, my mothers food is cold and mine isn't even what I ordered. It's covered in mushrooms, which I'm allergic to. I send it back and the waitress says she accidentally brought out the wrong food. My mom compares her ravioli to chef boiardee. 

The whole time the servers are arguing within clear earshot about how many rolls of silverware they need to roll each

Finally our server brings us our bill but she tells us she was mistaken and we can't actually use the coupon. We ask to speak to a manager, the manager just says he'll take care of it and we get our modified bill.

Overall bad experience"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and they have a nice 4 course special for $15 but the service was horrible.  We were not approached with a menu until more than 5 minutes after being seated.  When we finally ordered, the entrees came very slowly and when they did, they were plopped down without asking if we wanted ground pepper on our salad or Parmesan cheese on our pasta.  It wouldn't have been so bad if we had not observed other waiters taking better care of other customers.  People seated after us were finished before we had our main entree.  My wife asked for the manager and offered constructive criticism for how the person serving our table needs to improve.  We were not expecting anything and were surprised to have our entire meal comped.  We told the manager that we wanted to pay for our meal as that was not our reason for mentioning this to her but she insisted.  That does show some class but I hope they either train this person better of lessen their work load so that people don't get overlooked."}
{"text":"Going for lunch with one of my buddies. He had a coupon for Macaroni Grill that was good for a buy one get one free, make your own pasta entree. I had never been to Macaroni Grill but couldn't pass up a half price lunch. Good choice! The make your own pasta deal included the pasta of your choice, the sauce of your choice, and three toppings, all for $13. Plus you could add a protein for between $3 and $5. I went with the penne arrabbiata. I added red peppers, mushroom, and tomato as my toppings. And for three bucks I included Italian sausage as well. It also came with a caesar salad.
The Caesar salad was delicious. Lots of cheese and excellent crispy garlic croutons. My pasta dish came out better than I expected. It was a huge portion loaded with Italian sausage and large amount of mushrooms. Way more than I could eat for lunch. Plus the two for one deal made it taste even that much better. Excellent meal. Excellent value. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Getting seated right away on a Friday night was very much appreciated. But now we know why they weren't busy. Server brought bread right away but did not make us Italian butter despite Olive oil being on the table, so we had to ask her to make it for us. My wife asked for a glass of ice, as there was very little in our water and tea glasses.  It took 2 reminders before she got her ice. Our food was delivered by a runner who said, \"Chicken Alfredo?\"  I motioned it was for me. I noticed no chicken was showing on top of the fettuccini alfredo, but thought it might be buried underneath. Nope. Had to ask our server to complete the order. After approx. 5 minutes she brought the chicken out in a bowl. My wife's meal was cold on top and only lukewarm on the bottom. My chicken alfredo was dry and could have used more sauce."}
{"text":"We selected this restaurant because we had a gift card to use for our date night and on a Friday, had about a 20 minute wait.  So far, so good.  

Our waitress was really friendly, but not over the top and kept a check on us frequently. 

I had an Italian Mojito which I don't recommend, period...blech.  

We got the Zucchini Friti for an appetizer which was perfect and the dipping sauce was delish and the best part of our whole meal!  I got a salad with ranch dressing - it was fine...nothing special.  I ordered the Carmela's Chicken and it was bland, almost dry and overall just lacking.  I brought more home than I ate and reheated with some garlic sauce I had making it better than the original for lunch the next day.  I wouldn't get it again.  My husband got the steak and had fries that were better than the steak, which I thought was WAY undercooked, even for medium.  Blech!

I would give our waitress an extra .5 half star or maybe even a star, but our food was definitely not over a two star this visit.

Good thing we had a gift card.  We left a nice tip for our waitress with the balance since we had no plans of returning in the near future."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever eaten at Macaroni Grill before, and if I have, it's been a really long time...but we had a great meal, great service and I would recommend this location for sure!  Probably would give 3.5 stars if I could, but decided to round up based on attentive service and the fact that overall the dining expereince at this Macaroni Grill in the Ballantyne area was very good!  Not a higher score solely based on that my experience didn't wow me, but for a chain restaurant it was a solid experience and a great place to eat a casual meal!

We started with tomato bruschetta which was very good - tomatoes tasted freshly prepared and bread was grilled just right!  I selected Pollo Limone Rustica which was chicken in a lemon basil sauce with penne pasta and was baked to achieve a crusty top with creamy pasta and spinach underneath - very good and a large portion with plenty of leftovers for lunch! He had Chicken Marsala and very much enjoyed it as well - the sauce looked just right!

I would definitely return to sample some of the other dishes offered and maybe try one of the desserts that looked really good!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner with my wife and had a wonderful meal. I saw the reviews thats gave this location one or two stars and had to add my review. 
We arrived at 6pm on a Thursday and was seated very quickly with no wait. The servers were very nice. The food came out fast, very fast. So fast that the server appoligized and said.I'm sorry was that too quick.
We had calamari and stuffed mushrooms appatizers and both were very good. The mushrooms were stuffed with gogonzola and spinage. very good. The Calimari was satisfactory.
I had the lobster raviloi and it was three large pieces with lobster claw meat in the sauce.
I will return because the Goodyear Olive Garden is always packed with a wait."}
{"text":"Have been going here for a while. I loved what they did to their menu last year, but the quality has dropped since my last visit 3 months ago. The Parmesan chicken was not cooked well - it was like a giant gelatinous chicken nugget. The brick chicken didn't taste fresh. It was like a fast food chicken with that really dried out taste. I can't describe it but it was like the graininess of processed chicken. I really supported this place for over a year, but their quality has noticeably dropped. The salad was meager - I mean very small. The staff was profusely nice; the managers were very apologetic, but I begged them to understand that the quality of the chicken was just low - not their preparation."}
{"text":"They are so many options in Las Vegas.  This is not the place to eat.  We arrived on Saturday at 11:30 am, 30 minutes after they opened.  There were only a half dozen tables with customers when we arrived.  The wait staff told us about their great brunch. Great breakfast options.  We were a party of 5.  We ordered two of their skillet specials from brunch menu, one egg and bacon breakfast, one Caesar Salad with chicken.  After an hour of waiting we asked what the hold up was, we were told our food would be our soon.  Finally it arrives.  One breakfast had a piece of toast completely black on one half this was served bottom size down so it did not show on the plate. The eggs in the skillet were are the sunny side up and were underdone.  The manager stopped by and asked how breakfast us, I told him about the long wait and his response was the menu is new to the kitchen (3 weeks old) and they did not know how to prepare the food.  I called him on it and said it was a few eggs potatoes and meat. Pretty basic. To encourage us to return he offered to give us some thing.  He came back with 3 $5.00 coupons good on purchase of $25. or more (alcoholic excluded). that were EXPIRED. One coupon per visit. IS THIS A JOKE??? We returned them to the manager and he did not even have the respect for us as a customer to apologize.  Something needs to change!  The manager? the cooks? Maybe they should just cook what they know how to cook.  If you are looking for a GOOD BREAKFAST IN LAS VEGAS TRY: THE CRACKED EGG, EGG WORKS OR THE ORIGINAL PANCAKE HOUSE.  Depending on the time you arrive you may have to wait for a table it is worth it.  We spent $75.00 and will never return.  One positive note is they did have $2.00 Bloody Mary that was excellent."}
{"text":"I KNOW I submitted a review previously so WHERE is it?  We hadn't tried this at the time what was a new restaurant in our area but finally did and stopped in for maybe the 3rd visit.  I didn't have hair due to cancer so it wasn't easy going out, but I think cooking wasn't going to be a party that day.  We were seated near the hostess (lunch time), and we waited.  No server, no water, no bread, no nothing.  We looked around and still no acknowledgement we were seated, yet new diners that were seated after us were served.  15-20 minutes later, we got the hint and left, never to return, for at least 5 years or more and we dine out several times a week for 2-3 meals.

I suppose we were bored and decided to try after all those years of spending money and tips elsewhere.  It was alright.  We tried again and the service was horrible.  The tiramisu was rubbery, the food was eh.   So the service really, was hit and miss here.  We were seated in what we called the low rent section where you're forgotten, and the food was hit and miss.  Then there was a string of good meals but the service was iffy.  We stopped coming in again.

One more time.  Ordered our favorites with wine, and the waiter was excellent.  First, they all checked us out and pawned us on some young boy -- \"you take them, no you take them!\"  I'm not sure what that is about, why waiters THINK they know what type of customer you'll be.  

This young waiter didn't need any guidance, he refilled drinks, brought items we'd need w/o our asking, he remembered anything we did request, he was absolutely excellent.  We tipped him $15 but failed to take the online survey in time to give him kudos.  We went back again and he wasn't there.  I'll post his name which is somewhat unusual if I recall correctly, when I find the receipt, he was that good.  

So, there it is, there are good dishes to enjoy and I love the shrimp portofino and language lessons in the restroom.  Sometimes the service is good but, an almost equal amount of POOR -- BAD service.  Yes, the bread is good but the Italian style wine in the tumbler is unappealing, though I guess you yield a lot more ozs per glass this way."}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing. The cost was very high for the amout of food i got. It will be a place i go for special occasions or when i have alot of money. The lobster ravioli was absoloutly amazing thought"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience here with my family. I have a one year old and politely asked the server to please bring hers out as soon as he could; to which he responded \"that is policy \" in a snide manner. They never brought the appetizer or my daughter's food. Someone else brought out our food, which was not good and one was cold and chewy.  We ordered a bloody Mary that tasted like it had zero alcohol in it. The whole experience was terrible. I wish I could say anything positive."}
{"text":"Excellent service, the food was out so quick it was very impressive. Our waiter, Barren, made sure that everything we needed was taken care of. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Dreadful!!  Spaghetti and meatballs, yuck, cold pasta, packaged frozen meatballs, just terrible.  Hubby had a combo dish with \"lasagna\", chicken parmigiana, and cannoli.  Dreadful.  Cold, no sauce, cannoli was kinda like a nasty pasta burrito, chicken tough and cold, lasagna just layers of ricotta and noodles--obviously fresh from the freezer.  Yuck.  Both \"meals\" straight from freezer to microwave to table.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Usually I love macaroni grill but this particular location sucks. We waiting a good ten minutes before we were even acknowledged, and it was 3pm, restaurant was near empty. Waited another five minutes to be seated. The bathroom was a mess and smelled awful. I've worked in the restaurant business for years, and I know that even on a really bad day, a restaurant should never be this poorly run."}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The manager sat us at our table, and she seemed very angry. Did not welcome us, or smile, or tell us who our server was (i have worked in food service before, so I have certain expectations, especially when you drop almost 50 bucks on lunch for two people, the service better be fantastic) Needless to say, it was NOT, nor will I ever be returning. But anyways our server was just as bad as the manager. When I asked her about what they do for guests on their birthdays, she told me they get a slice of cake. I said, \"great! it's his birthday\". She replied \"okay\" and rolled her eyes, as if I were lying to her. That made me really angry. The food was overpriced, and the service was horrible. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Bottom line- If I didn't have a $25 gift card, I would have been very disappointed for paying 50 dollars for an \"Olive Garden\" meal I could have gotten for 25 bucks. Food was OK/good, Wife had eggplant Parm, while I did the Fettucine Alfredo with chicken. Had Calamari as an AP, (OK), and Caprese Salad, also just OK.

I don't think I'll go back, as I am a cheap bastard, and if I wanted to splurge, there are much better Italian joints in N. Scottsdale that I like more, that I am willing to fork out 20 bucks a meal for."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided on this location and restaurant because he'd never been there before and CLAIMS he doesn't like Italian food. Pah! So I picked this place to change his mind. My mom and I had lunch here a month before and it was delicious then. 

Not so much this time.

It was Valentine's day so we expected a wait, we aren't unreasonable. An hour and a half passed and people were seated that came in after us before the hostess noticed we had been there a while. Somehow we were overlooked,  but whatever. I'm starving and happy to be sat!! We were seated in a booth by the bar and didn't have a waitress proper. We had the super busy bartender who had little enough time to make drinks much less remember we needed drinks or silverware or ya know, any attention at all.  Again, can't blame her, it's valentine's day, crazy busy, they likely had callouts or something.

30 minutes later our order gets put in. 30 minutes later our appetizer comes out. Red flag should have been when I heard them 86 the mozzarella app we got. She brought out the appetizer, and just didn't mention how there was no mozz. I guess she figured we were new and didn't know any better. It was just this ricotta ish cheese and no mozz. Okay so the app was meh, main entrees yay! (An hour after putting the order in - dying of hunger lol) 

He ordered a pork dish and I had lobster ravioli. His would've been great BUT it was barely warm and tasted like it died in the window. 

My ravioli (5, don't order this if you're hungry), weren't even turned upright, which yknow whatever but what disappointed me is that it looked like they had dumped it off the tray they microwaved it in. And it tasted SO MICROWAVED. Mine wasn't hot either but I scarfed it down anyway. 

Definitely the worst meal and biggest waste of time I can say I've spent at a restaurant in a long time."}
{"text":"Great service, got half off a bottle of wine. My daughter was entertained by Shelly's beautiful singing! :D It did get a little hot though, like really hot like the AC might be going out, I don't know"}
{"text":"We showed up here at 11am and the doors were closed. Waited a bit came back around 11:06 am and it was still close. No one was inside and no employees in sight. Never coming back to this place again. I had never been there before and was really looking forward to having it today for my first time. We decide to go to Hash house ago go instead since they were open. I'll be sure to let everyone know about my experience at Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"Major disappoint with the quality of the food. Order spaghetti with meatball - the meat sauce was so watery and the meatball was super hard and overcooked! We also order the calamari for appetizer - wow it was like eating rubber! It was so bad that we had to tell our server and the manager agreed not to charge us..
The server was friendly but she needs to pay attention on details. We had to constantly ask for items that a server would normally provide the customers. For example: missing straw for our drinks or providing us the to go box but not giving us the to go bag. We had to get the olive oil next to our seat because ours was empty. 

I hope the manager makes the necessary adjustments and training to improve the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot.  It's near my wife's office and I would often taker her there for lunch.  They've changed the menu and added calorie counts.  Ordinarily, I get Shrimp Portofino, but upon noticing that it had a higher calorie count than Lamb, I opted for the Lamb.  I didn't mind paying a little more ($16.99 vs $12.99) for something I enjoyed especially if it was better for me, if only slightly.  

Anyway, the portion of lamb they brought out was 4 small pieces of meat on 2 skewers.  It wasn't much bigger than an appetizer portion.  In fact, if the vegetables were smaller, I would say it was an appetizer.  I realized the smaller calorie count was due to the significantly smaller portion.  For $16.99, it felt like a rip off.  For that amount of money, I would expect a dinner size portion, not a glorified appetizer.  

I'm not complaining about the taste.  The taste has been consistently good over the years.  I'm complaining about portion size and price.  I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD!!
And the house blend wine for $3 (Happy Hour) was a great taste at a great value.

I see that a lot of reviews are down on this place. I should start be saying that this was my first time in any Macaroni Grill ever.

Our server was fantastic, the wait to be seated and be served was right on. I had Chicken Marsala and the gladly subbed the standard pasta with Linguine. 
The bread was fresh and yummy. i love any place that bring s a variety of bread to the table. Speaking of the table, you can COLOR ON IT!!!!!!! How fun is that?!?!

The dining area plays classy music, the bathroom plays Learn Italian lessons and there was a distinction in the bar, where adults were aloud and the rest of the place, for everyone else with their kids.

We will be visiting not just Macaroni Grill, but this particular location, again and we will bring friends."}
{"text":"This is the actual location where my boyfriend worked as a server years ago. We also celebrated our first Valentines' day with dinner at this chain. As such, it has a special place in our hearts.

Service is always stellar- Charles in particular stands out.
The house wine (and rockin' honor system policy) and bread are both higher quality than other chain's standbys, but their smaller menu allows them to shine instead of spreading themselves too thin.

We always get the stuffed mushroom appetizer.
Favorite entrees include the chicken under a brick, Carmela's chicken, and the shrimp portofino. For lunch visits, the bibb and bleu salad is my usual, and I'm really bummed that the italian wedding soup is now a special instead of a menu staple. Favorite dessert is the lemon passion.

The service, food, and ambiance of this restaurant and the high standards of the chain make it one of the few places we choose to dine that isn't local."}
{"text":"This is honestly the rudest service I have ever gotten. I was close to walking out if it wasn't for my friend holding me back. We were seated by someone who said absolutely nothing but \"fallow.\" And then set down the menus and left. She said nothing else, nothing about my waiter, nothing! Then the waitress was the women who worked as the bartender, she wasn't fast but her job isn't to be a waitress... 

We ordered the calamari and the guy comes up to my table and sets the calamari at the edge of the table and left. I blurted out \"wow, really?\" He comes back and then replies \"oh, I'm sorry did you want me to take this back?\" I told him he was rude and he looks at me and smiles... Walks away and under his breath says \"Christ. Fucking people.\" 

I'm absolutely appalled..."}
{"text":"This was a horrible Christmas dinner! The olive oil for the bread was old and tasted like foil. 
Our waitress brought our salad out without croutons. She said, \"We ran out of croutons,  so you get a naked salad.\" I ordered the momma trio. The Alfredo sauce tasted like somone dumped the entire salt container in it.  My lasagna was cold in the middle and the chicken parmesan was an oily mess. My husband ordered the classic Italian bake. The sauce was extra spicy.  We had to send both back. The wait between items were way too long. Especially since I could see every item we ordered waiting on the counter and being moved around. 


We watched servers pick up, hold for two min and place other people food back on the counter.  One server offered the same two salads to three different tables."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be one of our favorites but has gone seriously downhill. Empty parking lot should have been our first clue. Terrible birthday dinner last night. How do they stay in business? All 4 of our meals were terrible. Mac and cheese made one daughter sick. Wife's steak was burnt to a crisp and had to be returned. New steak wasn't ready until our desserts came out. Shrimp portofino was also bad. Angel hair pasta was extremely overcooked and mushy. No flavor at all. And not many shrimp on top. Anywhere else this would have been a lunch-size portion, not an $18 dinner entree. Classic Italian bake was so overly spicy and had so much red chili it was almost inedible. She could only eat about 1/4 of it. We'll never be back. Among the chain Italian restaurants, Carabbas, Olive Garden and Brio are all infinitely better."}
{"text":"The service was great even though they were busy on a Friday night ! I love they vegan options here, with a waiter familiar with veganism! I will come back :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. We arrived at 7:30 pm. I ordered the build your own penne pasta plate. While the server was friendly, and replaced my drinks as soon as I finished them, I still can't do any more that 2 stars because the penne noodles were clearly old. They were stuck together and had the texture of rubber. I assume they were made for the dinner crowd (4:30-7:00?), but since we arrived at 7:30, we were served noodles that were cooked hours before and left under heat lamps. I was there on a gift card, and wouldn't go back if it was on my own dime."}
{"text":"We went here for an early dinner and the place was like a ghost town.  Our service was excellent.  The trio had very little chicken Parmesan and the lasagna was mostly pasta with very little meat.  For the price I think they could've spared a little bit more meat and cut back on the filler.  The blue bib salad was fantastic.  The mac & cheese bites were good but the french fry appetizer was just the same sauce from the mac & cheese bites and the potatoes were soggy and undercooked.  My daughter had the children's portion of the linguine Alfredo and she ate about half of it. She said it was just ok and preferred the dish at Carabbas. I don't think we would be in a hurry to eat there again."}
{"text":"Good service  not so good food won't be coming back that's for sure food tasted funny
Can't explain it  just not good"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for lunch. They were not busy at all. The hostess set us over by the bar in which the bartender Freddie was out waiter.  He came over to our table and assumed we wanted wine and started to pour and we both said NO we don't want wine. So he asked surprisingly oh what would you like? We ordered a Coke and an Iced Tea. He brought us our drinks and after 15 min brought us some house bread. I said it looked good and he said it was fresh out of the oven. When I went to cut it, it was cold and HARD as a rock!! So we both tried a piece and left the bread. Another 15 min went by and he came for us to order. He tried pushing appetizers and we said no we are ready for food!! We ordered and he went away. We were out of our drinks and he never looked our way he was being to suave to the young girls around!!
Our meal finally arrived. My husband got Alfredo and I got Carmella's chicken. He asked if we wanted fresh grated cheese and we said of course. He disappeared and did not come back for 10 min after we started to eat and the cheese was in a bowl. The food was good just small portions and they both could have used a little more sauce to them. Oh and I had to ask him for more drinks even after we saw him look directly at the empty glasses.
We were both done eating and he came over and asked if we wanted dessert we said no we are done!! Ready to go. He said ok and left. We saw him mix drinks and walk around. Finally after 20 min my husband raised his voice to get his attention to give us our check. 
We got the check and immediately my husband gave him our card. Then he had an issue processing our transaction. 10 min later he finally came back and stood around like he was waiting for a tip!! NOT FROM THIS TABLE!! 
We have been here previously several times and we always walk out unhappy. We will not be back at this location!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been regulars here for almost a year now. They always deliver excellent service and food. The chicken parmigiana is our favorite, and I love their house salad with the Mediterranean vinaigrette. Also, the bread is hot and crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside, yum! I always ask for balsamic vinaigrette but my boyfriend prefers just olive oil and fresh pepper. And, They're constantly sending out email coupons, for $10-$20 off, and half priced wine!"}
{"text":"Everything is pretty good so far. 

Easily accessible from the road with plenty of parking.

The bartender tonight, TK (Toccara sp?) made us the best Mango margaritas ever during happy hour. We had several rounds, the flavors were consistent. 

We came later in the evening, closer to closing. The staff was friendly. Both the GM and Manager came over to the bar and chatted us up briefly, very naturally. 

The food was outstanding. Our order was messed up but it was almost like we didn't know it because they remade it before it came to the table. Great job to the staff and chefs for making that happen. 

All in all, it was a great end to our Saturday. I highly recommend any Macaroni Grill, but this one in particular is pretty fabulous. 

Insider tip from a long time guest of the brand: if you go in the evening, try to go about an hour to an hour and a half before close. This chain has always been very popular, so the dinner hour can be difficult to navigate. If you do come during the dinner rush, be patient and plan to be there for a while. Enjoy the wine and the ambiance while you wait for your food and your experience will be more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Wow, I amazed at the low scores this place has received.  I have been here at least 10 times and I have never had a BAD experience.  I admit that on one or two occasions the servers were not at their best, but generally I have had great service and great food.  I am not huge on too many pasta dishes so I have stuck to what I love here.  The bowtie pasta with chicken and garlic is SOOOO delicious.  My 5 year old actually loves this place too, so kids can certainly enjoy a meal here."}
{"text":"Food was typical, seated and delivered fast.  There were several small service problems yet the server was unapologetic throughout."}
{"text":"I have come here many times and have always been happy with my meal. I always build my own pasta and they do exactly what I ask! I love that they are not afraid to use garlic :) I did get a waiter once that spent most of his time talking to people while my food sat and got cold. Not too happy with him. But, everyone else that works there has always been great! The only reason that I am giving this 4 stars is that I miss the whole wheat penne. Hopefully they bring it back again!"}
{"text":"Worse food I've had in a long time.  I ordered the Mama's Trio and the Alfredo pasta was old  pasta was over cooked and hard and the sause was curdled.  I took a few small bites of the lasagna and it was old too.  It was like it had been prepared last week and the reheated and burnt on the bottom.  The chicken was the only thing that was fresh but by that time I had such a bad taste in my mouth I didn't want to eat anything else.  We let the waitress know who had the manager cme and talk to us.  The end result was he to my plate and we paid the entire bill.  They didn't even attempt to make things better.  Didn't take the cost of my meal off even though you could see I didn't eat but a few bites and anyone could tell.that the food was OLD.

DO NOT GO THERE, SAVE YOU MONEY.  WHAT A WASTE!"}
{"text":"I have not been here in years.  Not sure why we go to Olive Garden now!  The kids loved their food! I loved my salad! Most importantly I brought my kids for the chocolate cake!!!!! Omg....so good!  The prices are very very very reasonable! Service was real good! And they comped the chocolate desert for my sons 7th birthday!  The chicken on key salad was so good. It tasted like real chicken real grilled chicken 
.not pressed pre prepared and frozen boxed rewarmed via microwave chicken! So glad I brought the kids here...we had a fun time and the atmosphere was wonderful! Our server Steve was super nice...."}
{"text":"Don't know if I like the changes made.. not sure if this is an overall company decision or just this location, but it seems like when we come here now, the prices are higher and the portions are dramatically smaller.

The reason why I say this is that we usually order the same thing when we come here, and the last time we did, we paid $60 for our meal and I was still hungry. That should never happen. I find myself coming back just to give this place chance after chance to improve, but I keep finding myself disappointed and hungry."}
{"text":"All I wanted was the big bowl of macaroni and cheese but it is no longer on the menu.  Despite the place being half empty they sat my pregnant wife and I right next to the wait station.  Tonight we dined on pasta and ass.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch ended up waiting for 40 minutes for our entree salad took 20. Food was definitely not worth the wait. Server brought us plates with food on them and seemed annoyed when I asked for clean ones. Crostini that came with the salad was stale. I also asked for a peach tea that I never received. Chicken scalloppine was terrible instead lf it coming with marsala sauce it was drenched in oil. It's too bad this was such a bad experience. Desert ridge location is much better and the only reason I came to this location in the first place. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. All three of our meals were cold when we finally got them. Manager took all the food off our bill, but acted like this was something he does all the time. Thought afte 5 years I would give them a second try. Will NEVER go back. Ony gave it one star because it had to so I could submit this review."}
{"text":"Called for takeout. On hold for 12 minutes. Ordered. Told it would take 20 minutes. Took 50 minutes. Food was okay. Service while at restaurant was good - nice people. Workers seemed busy (understaffed?). Restaurant half full. Too bad it took so long. 1 star for delay, 5 stars for service. 3 stars for food."}
{"text":"Service was slow but pleasant. Salads where served after a very long wait and ended up being brought out 2 minutes before the main dish that is very odd. Order a regular margarita as it was only one on the menu and instead got a strawberry one that was so strong could only taste the tequila. Plus typically a fruity margarita has sugar on the rim this one had salt. The lasagna was good but had are small portion that was hard as a rock and couldn't eat. It's been 20 years since my last visit I guess it will be another 20 years before my next."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in about a year. It has gone way down hill. I won't be back. We sat in the bar area and the floor was filthy. The women's restroom needs the sewer drain cleaned out , it stinks! They are aware of the problem because they had it covered with tape. The restaurant had just opened and there was no toilet paper in the stalls and no soap. Only one other table of people in the restaurant besides us. I thought that was strange for Sunday at lunch. The service was fine but the restaurant needs a good cleaning!"}
{"text":"Just okay Italian food in my opinion and WAY over priced for the quality of the food. Thanks but no thanks in my opinion. For what they charge this food should be much much better. I'd say their food is comparable to Olive Garden, but not quite as good, and that their pricing is higher."}
{"text":"I have not been to this restaurant in over a year. I was somewhat excited to have an late lunch/early dinner of Italian today so I decided to give it another try.  The service was awesome. I was the first to request to dine outside and they quickly accommodated and provided attentive service.  I started with the appetizer of baked stuffed mushrooms that are stuffed with goat cheese, spinach and spicy Italian sausage.($8)  Tasty and I'm told popular, however I was not impressed and would never recommend them. Something about that spicy just didn't click for me though I like spicy food, I just felt it was not a good paring with the smooth mild goat cheese and mushroom.  Still it was the best thing I would eat at this experience. I ordered a Caesar salad ($3) - over priced should be free. A small handful of bitter romaine lettuce and a drizzle of Caesar dressing 3 or 4 croutons with a generous portion of cheese in a small bowl.  So bad it took three croutons to get the fork-full of lettuce down. The server was kind enough to remove it from the bill.  

My entrée was to be Carbonaro ($13). I have had it at other restaurants and loved it. I have made it and served it to a number of people and they loved it. Never have I seen or even heard of a pouched egg served on this dish, as I was assured it must have to be Carbonaro. So I tried it. Noodles are some kind of pasta I never heard of but it's served hard and I mean about 3x harder than el dente' .  Sauce was not creamy and did not coat the noodles or the crisp ham in this case. sauce was tasteless. I tried about 3 bites but once asked I had to admit I didn't care for it. My server admitted it was quite different and agreed to bring me another entrée.   So I went with the Chicken Malino ($12).  Roasted chicken, bow-tie pasta, creamy garlic sauce, mushrooms & sun-dried tomatoes.   Served in a large bowl. A generous portion  about 2 servings actually.  
It was better or as I told the server more palatable.  I ate half of it took the rest to go but feed it to my dog what does she know about good Italian anyway?


Ruby (my dog) says:
\"Andiamo! Sono un cane-io non so nemmeno il cibo è italiano!\"

Anyway as I thought about the food after trying 2 entrées I came to the this conclusion. The building, the tablecloths, the interior and even the patio are what this restaurant chain sells well.  It makes ones visit memorable.  It's the setting for a nice date or to bring out of town guest to, to socialize of  wines and to break bread together.  It's the backdrop to some nice dining photos as well.  It's moderately priced yet over priced after all it's mostly pasta and lettuce you're getting.  But when it comes to the food, they pretty much threw together ingredients that would sound or appear in print to be appealing.  It's a simple menu that doesn't take much talent or time to prepare.  It's really rather awful food placed in a beautiful setting. How anyone who can cook Italian or has ever been to one of the many little Italy communities in America or Canada can really say they love the food here is beyond my ability to believe or comprehend.  So if you go drink lots of wine and maybe you'll forget that the food is lousy you are buying.  But hopefully the staff will be attentive and keep your glasses full.  And maybe you'll get a few nice photos on your phone.  Oh and none of the food looks like it does in the pictures added to this review site! I knew I should have took pictures of something while there.  My meal plus ice tea ($2.50)  Was $24.51.  NOT a cheap date for my book.  Multiple that by 2 or more and add wine or other drinks and you'll scratch your head and ask yourself  \" For this I paid what?  And I'm hungry in 2 hours!\"  
I gotta go I'm sure there's something in my home fridge that will hold me over until my next meal!"}
{"text":"The short drive from LV was well worth it. From the moment we walked in the service was friendly and attentive. Our waiter, Guy, was top drawer! He recommended the two appetizer special for $9.95 and suggested the stuffed peppers and the cheese & prosciutto brochettes. They were both excellent! 
My wife ordered the shrimp scampi (as did Gary) and there were more than enough shrimp to fill you up without the delicious spaghetti noodles on which they were served. I had the pork-chop with fig balsamic sauce. It was served over fire-roasted vegetables which included red onion, red and yellow sweet peppers, zucchini, yellow squash and baby potatoes. Which I prefer my pork just slightly more rare, (most people like theirs well) it was still delicious and the vegetables and sauce were great. 
Guy could not have been a better waiter! Always there when needed but not hovering like a pest. Funny, friendly, helpful. 
The bill was very reasonable with entries around $20 and the quality was excellent."}
{"text":"At lunch, I entered the restaurant and asked for a table where I could get a quick lunch.  I had visited this restaurant before and had waited in the bar booths for 30 minutes without seeing a person.  That day I left.  Today, after waiting 10 minutes and not getting a glass of water, I asked for the manager.  Juan came over, told me that I really didn't wait that long, and he took my order for Chicken scallopini.  The waitress waved from the other side of the restaurant.  The pasta was tasty.  The chicken was blah.  No taste whatsoever.  I won't go back, which is sad as it is located, near my work."}
{"text":"My first time ever eating at a Romano's MG. The group I was with said the food was great. I ordered Lasagna (only) for $13.00 and was not impressed at all, actually disappointed. The portion was extremely small and half of the 2 layers of noodles on top, were overdone and crunchy, inedible! Thankfully, their bread was good, with real butter. The service was great and the atmosphere was great but I have no desire to return. 

I think you get a much better deal at Olive Garden, portion and money wise. I'm very honest when I say this and actually, a little bit embarrassed but the frozen lasagna at Aldi from Bremer was much, much better all around."}
{"text":"great service, location, and menu selection. the food is very reasonably priced and the portions are very generous.

overall, wonderful place."}
{"text":"Happy hour was the ticket today as my date and myself were forced here due to the large crowd over at the Sandbar. It turned out to be a great switch as it was not crowded and we caught the last 1/2 hour of the 4-7pm happy hour. All beers and some cocktails were 5 bucks and the bartender gave us free bread with that olive oil to dip. We also ordered a very decent pepperoni pizza for 5 bucks. The pepperoni seemed fancier as did the whole pizza in general. Plenty of food for two. They also handstuff blue cheese into the olives that go into your martini. Not sure of a second date, but another visit to Happy hour is more certain."}
{"text":"We were patient, but the service was very slow.  Our drinks (iced tea) arrived halfway into our meal.  The  meals were about average - not great.  The fried calamari was tasteless and overcooked.  Overall, not a very pleasant evening."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst meal we've had in years.  The calamari was so overcooked that it literally had no flavor.  My steak was delivered cold and the salad was very limp and lifeless.  Our waiter was nice, but not very attentive.  This was our second meal in the last 3 months that was sub-par.  We will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This was my first time to the Macaroni Grill on Stephanie in Henderson. I don't remember the bread being so pungent of Rosemary.  Not being a big fan, the bread was lacking. The rest of the party simply didn't like it. The food was very tasty and the service was excellent. I had a gift certificate from a local car dealership that was worth $100.00. Good thing I had brought money with me, they wouldn't honor it, so check with the manager before you assume anything. It was a very good and enjoyable evening. I can see that reservations might be in order on holidays."}
{"text":"This location has always looked after me, specially the 2 guys behind the bar.   The food was really good, the staff have always been excellent, and tonight was no exception."}
{"text":"What a pleasant location! I popped by for a quick TO-GO order. The service was friendly and quick. I was in and out in about 15 minutes. The spaghetti Bolognese was tasty and just like I remembered. I ordered a lunch order of Chicken Scaloppine. I love the sauce with capers. They also had a loaf of rosemary. 

I will be back with my family!"}
{"text":"I've been to Romano's at several different locations. The food is consistent at all locations. At this location out waitress was so accommodating. We were adding and subtracting to our orders a lot but she handled it very well. The only problem was that we ordered veal parmesan and we received chicken parmesan. We ate it anyway but let her know. The manager stopped by and he said the problem was that the veal container in the kitchen was labeled as chicken. Our waitress came over later with the veal and said the chef felt bad. They didn't charge us for the chicken or the veal!"}
{"text":"Always a great choice for dinner! Quick and excellent service! I have tried numerous things off the menu, and never disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was OK, not bad. I took my brother and his wife here on his birthday... he likes this place better than I do, but hey, Happy Birthday, Chris! 

Food was good. Ambience pretty nice... it was a comfortably warm summer night, so it was kind of like we were at a seaside restaurant (I don't really know why else I would think that). Only one reservation about this place. Our dweeb waiter was rather obnoxious. He kept asking questions that seemed a little personal... um, just bring us our food ,dumbbell.

Anyway, good food, nice atmosphere, enjoyable evening. Recommended."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start I come in take 15 minutes to  get service I finally get my order, my chicken is ice cold they tell me to  make a new one instead the chef chose to just dump it into a sauté pan and heat it up and serve it right back at me discussing, terrible  I'm so pissed right now !!!!!!!!!!!!! Something needs to change there's other times that this is happened to me but now I got to go back into work hungry and super mad !"}
{"text":"Great food and smiling faces! My family loves this place!  Wish they would bring back the homemade chocolate cake though :)"}
{"text":"The food wasn't that great- so I'm not a fan - the salad was the only thing worth eating"}
{"text":"Such horrible service. Servers have no idea what they're doing. Can here with a large corporate group for soup and salad, been here an hour and a half and still no food... won't be returning. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went back the other night and of course the food was good, but this time the service was ...  not as good as normal and we actually ended up speaking to the manager who made things right.  

We will certainly be back again and be sure to try the Vodka Rustica as it is awesome!"}
{"text":"There is a lot about this place that I do like. We can start there. Service is pretty impeccable. Our server was very attentive, yet not overly attentive. Our group, consisting of two couples, had nothing but compliments and tipped accordingly. The décor and atmosphere work. The specials on wine (Tuesday night) were great- about $2.50(?) for a glass of either house red or white.

The food and corresponding prices just didn't do it for me. I feel like Olive Garden is a better bargain. Portions were generally pretty small, whereas you might get 2 times as much at OG. 

Overall, I'm not a huge fan of any Americanized Italian joint, let alone one where I don't find much value in my order. So yeah, I'm a little impartial regardless. I guess if your looking for a decent meal and not too concerned with cost or the portion sizes, it is probably a decent place to grab a makeshift Italian bite. There are a good variety of dishes here too."}
{"text":"The service was fast and attentive. We were sat immediately with a group of 8. The food was great and priced well.  The menu had some great and interesting options including lower calorie choices."}
{"text":"My son was craving Italian so we decided to head to eat here. My son ordered the Artisan Farmhouse Pizza and I ordered the Steak and Greens Salad.  The pizza was delicious but doughy.  The salad is hearty, every ingredient complimented each other from the tender steak to the onions and gorgonzola crumbles.  The balsamic dressing added heat and smokiness as it was spicy, peppery.  DELISH! If you like a spicy dressing over steak and greens this dressing is perfect. The waitress was attentive .. but a 3 Star because the easiest item on the menu which is the pizza should have been perfect. IMHO  I will go again soon just for the salad."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant but today it was the worst experience ever!!! Server was not nice at all and the food was horrible not to mention the service.... A place I would never come back....."}
{"text":"Freezing all over, wasting energy and the tattooed manager refuses to make it warmer. Too busy chatting with the large cook in black loudly and disturbing peaceful diners. There for free Veterans meal. Long wait to get someone to wait on us. Ran out of meatballs and substituted with sausage for the free spaghetti. Our waitress was very new and was extremely accommodating however she's got some co-workers with issues. Equally/poor management! I can see why few customers were there for Veterans Day!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch.  The place was pretty quiet. The waitress passed by me 3 times, never said hi.  I finally just left."}
{"text":"I know I know, a chain restaurant. However, sometimes you really want the familiar and this place definitely delivers that. This particular Romano's Macaroni Grill is very clean, and probably unfortunately for them, typically fairly quiet. This location is very close to my home so my husband go here for a quick Italian bite if we don't feel like cooking or venturing too far from home. 

We've never had an issue with any of the staff here. We're always sat quickly and served beverages, plus their rosemary bread, promptly. All the staff are very friendly and typically seem quite happy to serve you and answer any questions you may have. I have to say that I absolutely love their rosemary bread (often times my husband and I ask for a loaf to go because it's just so wonderful!). They typically do some sort of nightly special, which never disappoints. This has even included a lamb entree previously that was perfect. 

The place also has a full bar (duh) with plenty of wine selections (and their menus even go so far as to recommend what wine pairs with what entree, pretty neat). 

While this place is just a chain, it is a very well maintained, and well staffed location that is a top choice for decent Italian."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this restaurant in 15 years. Used to love everything about it...ambiance, food, lots of energy. Now it feels like a mausoleum! The service was horrendous (ordered soup and salad which arrived 25 minutes apart and the soup was cold), my glass of white wine was warm and the bruschetta was pathetic. Simply awful. The manager did adjust our bill to compensate for our completely disappointing experience, which was appreciated, but we'll never be back. Too many other fantastic options out there."}
{"text":"Please give this place a chance  if in the area! Maybe those other reviewers had one bad experience.  My husband and I have eaten here 3 times in the last year and always have a great food experience.  I had the Italian Bake; 3 large meatballs with 2 links of Italian sausage, plus generous amount of rigatoni pasta served over tomato sauce.  Excellent!!! My husband had their Trio which consisted of fettuccine Alfredo, chicken parmigiana, and lasagna.  Outstanding and very generous portions.  In addition we had side salads. bread with oil for dipping. The wine of was very good! 
I hope this place stays in business as it is located between some hotel chains.  
We mentioned one small question to our waiter and next thing the manager came to our table to insure all was acceptable. They are paying attention to the customer and aim to please.  
Please come out to support this place!! I wouldn't walk across the street for Olive Garden, but this place is a real gem!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to alot of macaroni grills, and this place was horrible,  I've had better food in a mall's food court..place was in clean..the food was awful and tasted like it was a t.v. dinner...staff was great!!"}
{"text":"Frequent this restaurant and fortunately it will be the last. We had the ultimate worst experience tonight and I can't entirely blame the server since he was giving a table of 12 right next to us and two other booths in the next section. But we were never checked on our food was delivered twice to the wrong table, allowed to sit up in the window no one checked on us!!! As he catered to the large table that wasn't even completely seated when we arrived we were never asked how her food was we were never given an update he poured their oil offered them cheese offer them refills and we got nothing. The kicker is when he told me after I asked for the bill twice and waited 15 minutes for it to arrive that the manager would remove an item when he returned the bill with my card and it was not off I asked him about it again and he said yeah she changed her mind she doesn't want to do it. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill has always been a favorite of mine. I liked that they served good Italian fare and no matter which one you went to they were always consistently good. However, that all changed on my last trip. I opened the menu and to  my dismay all my favorites were gone, they had completely changed the menu. Throwing aside the classic recipes that have made them so popular in an attempt to make themselves more upscale and fancy. When I go out for Italian food Im not looking for somebody's fancy interpretation of a dish I'm looking for the real deal. Bottom line is if it's not broke don't fix it."}
{"text":"Decided to try Romano's today after a few years absence due to poor service.   Experienced the same poor service. i won't be trying it anymore."}
{"text":"This is a review just for take out.

If you like to get high, go to McDonald's and order a buffalo ranch mcchicken the buffalo chicken pasta from Mac grill is for you.  It's similar to a buffalo mcchicken but upgraded with cheese, spices, and pasta.  It's pretty dank.  My compliments to the chefs."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here about a week ago.  I'm writing this review to applaud our waitress, Julie.  She was perfect.  Greeted us warmly, and very helpful as we were making our selections.  The drinks were especially good.  My food was just a little dry but my husband had no complaints.  Julie checked back with us just enough.  She is very considerate and makes you feel as though you are her only customer.  It made the dining experience special and we will be going back and asking for Julie."}
{"text":"This was the first time we have ever eaten at a Macaroni Grill. And we were extremely disappointed! We waited at least 10 minutes for anyone to approach our table.  The manager had to ask us if we were being helped yet. Was not busy but seemed under staffed. Our server (Jaime) was horrible. He only took our order and took away our plates. Did not offer fresh cracked pepper, grated parmesean or even ask us how our meal was. The food was not impressive. Not worth the $40 we spent on lunch. We love italian food but this seemed to all come out of a jar or can. We will not being visiting this establishment ever again.  
-Extremely Disappointed"}
{"text":"I LOVE Italian food.  With that being said, it's kinda hard to mess up a good pasta dish with marinara sauce and generous use of garlic.  In this respect, Romano's doesn't dissapoint.  Yet with a million and one places in town to get good Italian food, this place ranks about halfway.

Why you ask?  I visited yesterday for lunch and had a decent meal.  I began their bread: warm, \"rustic\", and served with olive oil.  Then, I had a salad with house dressing (a balsamic, Greek-ish tasting concoction) and Chicken Parmesan.  The rosemary on top was a nice touch that other chains don't do. The sauce was good, but no different really than Bertolli's chunky marinara in a jar. Otherwise, it was as predictable as any meal at Olive Garden or Carraba's.  For $12, I was a bit dismayed at the portions.  The service was virtually non-existent during our meal; the water glasses were not refilled. The service alone brings the rating down to 2.  

Though I would return to Romano's if invited by someone, I'm shocked (or perhaps lulled into apathy) by its mediocrity.  I suppose this place makes a nice lunch destination, but don't expect to be \"wowed\" by it.  Its neither elegant or authentic, its just another Italian chain."}
{"text":"I like the fact that they have have a great menu and the food is always been good here I don't care too much open seating area. I do like this for quick Italian.  I also find the service good. Sometimes the kitchen can be slow though."}
{"text":"Ok so I hadn't been there in awhile and I recently went twice and had two different experiences. Both were pleasant but one more so than the other. The only problem I had the first time was that I ordered the lobster ravioli and got a piece of shell in my mouth...that threw off the evening, especially because it was my birthday dinner. The second visit however, was very nice. It was my friend, her son, my son and myself and we were out again for my birthday because I hadn't gotten to celebrate it with her yet and she wanted to go out. I picked Macaroni Grill because I love Italian but really can't stand Olive Garden or Tagliani's anymore, plus Macaroni Grill is close to both of us so it was the perfect choice and it paid off. Our waitress was excellent, kept our drinks full and got everything out of the way quickly after we were done. We really appreciated that because our boys were reaching for everything and it's just easier for us to get everything out of their way. They even gave me a second free dessert after I told them I'd been there the week prior for my birthday with my family. Thanks Macaroni Grill! Sorry I can't remember the name of the waitress...She was awesome though."}
{"text":"Back in the east coast, I enjoyed Romano's Macaroni Grill because of the good food in large portions, casual setting, and gracious and fast service.  During the UYE I attended here with fellow yelpers Rand, Mike, Robyn, Georgie, Arlin, and Masha, I found the setting to be just as casual. The person who served us was courteous and friendly but it seemed that she was swamped at the time we were there. We came in at opening time and there were quite a number of tables she had to attend to simultaneously, and though she was very busy, she tried very hard to accommodate everyone. Perhaps the restaurant should have more staff around at that time. As for the food, the portions were not as large as I was accustomed to from back east, but sufficient and it was tasty."}
{"text":"Went her on tonight for something different have maybe been to this one once before.  Seemed kinda empty in the parking lot and when we walked in but once we were done I could see why. Bartender was a little less friendly than you would expect especially since we were the only 2 patrons sitting there.  Ordered salads came out quick food took awhile even the bartender was complaining it was testing forever..  Hmm.  Finally food came wife's was a little charred from sitting under the heat lamp mine came out a few minutes later. Food was OK,  never once asked how it was by the staff set cc out to pay check was the quickest thing to happen the whole experience and no can I get toy anything else or anything. Note sore what happened to chains they all seem to have lost their spark. . Maybe we are spoiled with some of the other places in town but is rather go to Robertos than a chain sit down anymore food quality is better and your know what you're gonna get and that's pretty sad."}
{"text":"We had excellent service, was very impressed with the organization our server showed. The food was wonderful, very fresh and cooked to perfection. Our Son loved it and said he will be going back with his friends."}
{"text":"Cocktails are awesome and the food is consistently good.  We love the blood orange martinis and chicken parm with the spicy tomato sauce.  Its our favorite stop when flying out of Cleveland airport."}
{"text":"Our entrée wasn't what the menu stated. Let the waitress know and the manager, Kristin went out of her way to make it right. Our waitress, Rochelle, was super pleasant and sang \"Somewhere over the Rainbow\" for my kids! Will return due to the genuine experience that most restaurants lack now a days."}
{"text":"The food was awful. My mushroom ravioli was rubbery and so unappetizing looking they should have been ashamed to let it out of the kitchen. My daughters chicken was so overcooked she could not cut it. The waiter told us we should have sent it back but he did not come back to check on us. Will never go back to this location again. Stay away there are a lot of other restaurants nearby try one of those"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch but it took over an hour to get our food and they were out of half of their dishes we asked for. The  appetizer bruschetta was cold bread and tomatoes sauce  in a bowl. I had to send my \"chicken\" under a brick back as it was even more hard and dry then the bread. As vice was poor and no one seemed to care. Do not come here."}
{"text":"I can't leave a good review as we did not stay for dinner.  As we were being shown to the table we couldn't believe
 the thick dust on the side of the booths and along the floor railing ( highlighted by the low evening sun streaming in the open door) The next thing we noticed was the food crumbs all over the floor.  I told the waitress we would not be staying because of the dirty condition of the restaurant. As we were leaving my husband said \" we should never have entered\" he had noted the unwashed windows as we were entering I shutter to think of the condition of the kitchen.  That's why few cars in the lot consistently.  To bad as we enjoy the chains restaurants as we travel.  Wheaton,il
Is our home base Marconi grill.   Kudos to that spotless well maintained restaurant."}
{"text":"I came at 12 noon on a Saturday. Jordan our waiter was nice. We waited a whole hour and 18 minutes on my party I had 4 and received our food different times. It was COLD. Horrible."}
{"text":"Shout out to Robert, the new manager, for making sure our food was made just right! As regulars of macaroni grill, it was nice to be taken care of so well. We'll be back!! #idontlikeolivegarden"}
{"text":"We loved the appetizers and our server was wonderful. Surprisingly fabulous for a chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very underwhelmed by the experience. Waitress hardly paid us attention. Steak not cooked right. Had to ask for more bread. Salad took too long to come out I forgot it was even coming."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and we're kind of skeptical. The menu was very small and plain. Our waiter jeremy did a very good job, he was very friendly. 

We started off with the 2 antipasti for 10$. We ordered the baked prosciutto and mozzarella, and goat cheese peppadews.  I enjoyed the prosciutto, my fiancé said it was a bit salty for her. The peppadews were nothing to write home about. 

For the main corse, I had ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. It was lacking flavor, chicken was not seasoned well. My fiancé ordered pasta di mare, she enjoyed it very much and said her scallops were cooked perfectly. She also appreciated how they shelled and cleaned up the shrimp. 

After the great service and not so great food, I am going to say I would probally come back here if I'm feeling despite for Italian food."}
{"text":"12 hours in the North Carolina sun and we were beat!  100 degree temps, 98% humidity, and an empty stomachs - it was time for a climate controlled environment and a TON of food.

Our stop at MG was exactly what we were looking for.  Started off with a couple apps, into the salads, delicious dinner, loaves upon loaves of bread in between.  Plus, it felt about 50 degrees cooler inside than it was on their patio.  Almost too cold - when I wasn't eating I was shaking from shivering so hard.  Gotta love those speedy climate changes.

The amazing staff were right on top of everything - never an empty glass of water or question un-answered."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain, but Between this and Olive Garden, I would def pick this place. Service was great at this location and food not bad at all, although not excellent, I think it still deserves a good 4 stars"}
{"text":"It was alright, but if I'm driving that far I'm going to Maggiano's. The aroma that you smell when you walk in gets you excited about their food. However it doesn't WOW you or anything. Service was good and attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food was excellent. Recommend the butternut squash pasta, pan fried eggplant and try the macaroni bites! Had a great time. Mariah our server was superb!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night with a group of people. Our food was excellent as was the service. Alan, our waiter, was very attentive and was very helpful when we had questions about the menu. One member of our party had never dined at Romano's before, and she enjoyed it very much. I had the Pasta Milano and it was excellent as always!"}
{"text":"This was a decent experience service was good nia was our server and she aimed to please us the best she could the only problem we had was the cook my meal was a little dry for spaghetti some other noodles were over cooked my mothers meal had meat when she specifically asked for no meat but the actual manager (Tim) remade my mother's meal and it came out phanominal the service was really spectacular here Joey another server also packaged our meals and was very attentive"}
{"text":"Unfortunately.. this restaurant is a disappointment. Quality of food is terrible. What happened to this restaurant ? The food used to be good.   The management does not care about the customer's satisfaction. For sure, not coming back here."}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying we are Macaroni Grill regulars so obviously we usually have a good experience, however, tonight the service was so awful that despite several attempts to help the server autocorrect, it got worse by the minute... literally with time spent sitting between food while one appetizer came out and then my soup but then nothing for ten minutes in between.  My daughter's food finally came out and it looked like it had sat awhile so it was all dried out. No problem, I'd like to get more sauce but she never returned.  Even though I pointed to my salad and said my app isn't up but there's my salad, server looked and walked away.  Finally I asked for the check and she even messed that up.  I told her she needed to work on her service and she could care less stating she knew.  Sadly although I know the manager came by a couple times and could see we were waiting but never offered to fix it.  I told her at the end the waitress wasn't ready for the floor and the manager just looked again like she knew!  I mean come on!  Tonight was a prime example of why even the best food can be ruined by lousy sloppy service.  Honestly I didn't see any evidence of service experience on this gals part, much less experience at Macaroni Grill!  Shame on the manager for not addressing it!"}
{"text":"Having visited this restaurant many times over the few years it has been here, I have always had a good experience. We are greeted with a feeling they really want you there and the wait persons are more the helpful and just friendly enough. No matter what I order it is always well done and satisfies."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences ever.  I had not been to a Macaroni Grill in a long time, decided to stop in for dinner one night.  Ordered the Chicken Marsala.  It was the worst piece of chicken I have ever tasted.   One half of it was OK, the other half was tough as leather, literally.  I could not eat it.  Terrible, terrible, terrible."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner. Place was busy as it was dinner rush, heard the sound of plates crashing and server came around corner with two of our plates dropped one, pasta was hanging off edge of mine, my jaw almost dropped when server used his hand to flip my pasta back on my plate and placed it in front of me. Yum yum. Ate here another time as I was taking a bite of my ckn parmesan server stopped by to check on us. I fished out a 3 inch strand of hair out of the mouthful I had right in front of her ? Go to Tony Roma's or any place else."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch experience, quick and very tasty. 10 dollar lunch special is SO MUCH FOOD!  Diamond was an absolutely incredible server, she made me feel so welcome!  Love this place. In and out in 40 minutes for a great quick lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering food through a food delivery service from Macaroni Grill. I got the eggplant parmesan dish. It taste good but when delivered there was 2 utensils in the bag with 3 ordered dishes. My eggplant parmesan was dry!!! Very little sauce, noodles coated in oil and the cheese was a little too dark on half of the eggplant because it didn't have sauce. I was a little disappointed but maybe I should just order extra sauce? My ither thing too that I was baffled about was that there wasn't any bread sticks or dinner rolls to go with 3 PASTA dishes."}
{"text":"Husband & I along with many of our friends went here for a luncheon & had some fantastic food here. We had a very nice comical waitress that we had fun clowning around with & writing silly things on the paper tablecloth that they have there with the crayons. It is alot of fun to just draw or write something silly on there. The Alfredo spaghetti I got was very good & liked the $10.99 lunch meals that they had on their menu. This is really a very nice place if you feel like some Italian food & it is good & not that expensive either."}
{"text":"A million Macaroni Grille's in the world, and this is the first one I went to. Lucky me.

Seriously. 

On a really freakin' hot July afternoon, it was an oasis. 

Nice music playing in the background, big glasses of ice cold water, a great waitress and it was just dark enough and cool inside. 

And the food was good, the Meatball Sandwich was way too big for our companion to finish, so she had lunch for the next day settled on. 

The Penne Rustica was extremely filling and full of cheese and shrimp. 

And the Scallop and Spinach Salad was really good, however, the bitterness inherent in cooked spinach became a bit tiresome. So the salad wasn't finished. But the huge glass of water and iced tea that I consumed may have been a factor."}
{"text":"I'm writing a review as both a rebuttal to what is a ridiculously low rating and a standalone rating for a restaurant that I've been to dozens of times over the years.

1). The food is always good.  I've never had a bad dish.  Often, I order a 2 antipasti combo for $9.49.  I also like the Mama's Trio, among many others.

2). The service has always been good.  Is there such a thing as always flawless services?  No.  But collectively on the whole, the service is good.

3).  Let's talk about this horribly low rating here on Yelp.

It makes me question the intention of the reviewers, their unreasonable expectations, and just about every thing else they may have to say.

If this restaurant had 4-star rating, I would have said \"ok, fair enough\".  Even 3.5 stars would've been acceptable enough for me to not write this rebuttal even if I think that number is too low.

But 2.5 stars?  That's absurd.

Do better Yelpers."}
{"text":"Ordered salmon dinner and an app to go. Picked it up and got home to find half the order isn't in the bag. Along with a crappy piece of salmon that is cooked to the texture of rubber I paid for nothing. When I called they gave me the run around and had more of a\"uuuhhh I don't know\" answer than a resolution."}
{"text":"Service is okay. Once they figure out who your table belongs to they take care of you. Food is pretty good for this type of restaurant. I hadn't been here in over 5 years. I'm surprised it's still here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the quality of the food. Ordered a caprese salad and it was soggy and very warm, ordered a pasta and it was cold.Ordered two desserts, both were wrong and the presentation was terrible, soggy and melted. Extremely dissatisfied with my entire experience including contacting the restaurant and speaking to a manager who just wanted to blame the driver. Unhappy with both the quality and the lack of professionalism at this location."}
{"text":"All was Okay until a table of 8 were seated at lunchtime. After waiting for someone to come around to get us more water or mimosas, I saw our server now at the beck 'n call of the larger( among other characteristics) table. Time went by, the mngr on duty asked if everything was okay, I requested a box & the check. Had to walk to the hostess table to get the attention of someone, to pay.  How presumptive of her to think we didn't notice this had gone on. I could presume myself this sour behavior had much to do with size of party, race, age- all while assuming they will leave behind a good tip, and me and my companion won't, based on characteristics of the opposite. Foul."}
{"text":"why are you closed i want bread please I need the bread for my starving family the witch from down the lane cursed our crops and we have no other way"}
{"text":"The food was exceptionally good and the service was prompt. We made a reservation and were immediately seated. My phone experience was actually entertaining when making the reservation, and the gentleman I spoke with made it a point to have a good conversation with me at the time of reservation. The food is a little on the pricey side, but getting salad and bread with the meal made it more worth it. Will definitely make a return trip for Lunch, as I saw a great lunch deal marketed on the wall and will try it again for that!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever by the bartender Joe. He was so stressed and angry with all of the customers, he was slamming down the alcohol bottles. When he was dealing with us he was trying to rush us and get it over with. Hardly checked on us and took over 10 mins to fill our drink orders. We asked to cancel our order because we were just sitting there waiting and not getting any service.  On top of it when he brought the bill he overcharged us for an additional drink."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant in Arizona. Our waiter was amazing. He did such a great job and was so friendly. We had great conversation and good food. This restaurant always has great prices on meals as well. I look forward to my next visit there."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times before and always left happy.  Tonight we walked in at 6:30 pm and it was pretty empty. It had been about a year since we had been here so of course I wondered why it was not crowded, when everywhere else in town is. It didn't take me long to figure out the reason. They keep the restaurant so cold that it feels like a meat locker. Very uncomfortable! Our server, Steven, left quite a bit to be desired. He was wearing old looking jeans that were sagging, and far from uniform appearance. He had a very laxidasical attitude, and after our appetizer was done, he took the plate away and we waited over 15 minutes for him to ask to take our order. He never did. We had one empty chair for someone who was joining us a little later. I guess he assumed we weren't ordering until they got there. I can't imagine you wouldn't at least ask. I had to finally tell him we wanted to order. He was terrible about taking away the dirty plates, and had to be ask for things that should have been automatic, such as balsamic vinegar to go with our oil for our bread. Overall it was a very disappointing experience and I don't think we will be back. I'll be surprised to see this place in business 6 months from now. The food was actually pretty good, but the service will definitely not have people wanting to come back."}
{"text":"Maybe because it was 105 degrees outside and this place had spray misters, but the restaurant was better than other's in the chain.  Now, still average and a little on the pricey side, but the flat thin pizza was worth the price..."}
{"text":"I stay away for chain restaurants for a reason and my recent dinner only confirmed that. 
Food-bland and inconsistent from person to person. 
Wait staff - sucked and no effort
I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I was the rating on yelp but didn't take the time to read the reviews, it's the Macaroni Grill, I know what their food is like and so it can't be that bad right? Wrong. A Monday night, they were not busy, the waiter was SLOOOW. Good was good, salad a little wilted but overall very good salads, entrees and bread. Took 1.5 hours for the dinner and we ordered promptly. The waiter just took forever in between everything, even bringing the to go boxes, bringing the check and bringing the bill after he finally ran it. 

The staff seemed disconcerted, lots of people working quietly and expressionless. Our waiter even dissed his management a couple times. Unprofessional."}
{"text":"I had the Create Your Own Pasta.  There is a choice of pasta, sauce, vegetables, and meat.

I had the 100% whole wheat fettuccine, marinara style sauce, asparagus, and roasted tomatoes.  I asked about the pasta, and believe I overhead at the restaurant a manager say it is organic.

Everything was cooked al dente.  It was the best pasta I have ever eaten.  The sauce was good as well."}
{"text":"I'm OUTRAGED with how terrible the food quality is here. I ordered pickup for macaroni cheese and spaghetti with meatballs. I should've known from the moment I walked in because when I arrived my two pasta orders were sitting on the counter with lids, along with my two side salads that had NO lids. It was minutes before someone even packaged it all for me to takeout. We opened everything back at home to find that the salads were less than half full. The macaroni and cheese was cold completely solidified together! The meatballs in the pasta were cold and dried out. The only decent edible item was the pasta & we only ate it because we had no other food. The macaroni was thrown out because it was hard to pull apart and tasted like rubber. I can't believe we wasted $30 at this location. So appalled I called the management to let them know. I wish I had also looked at yelp before coming. NEVER COMING AGAIN."}
{"text":"What's the point of curbside service if I have to walk in and get my food.
Why is the old prison snitch in the football jersey getting an attitude with me?
When I'm just trying to get my food and get an answer to why is there curbside service available but I had to walk in.
When normally I park here and they bring out my food
Why do I feel like the girl who took my order didn't bring it out on purpose?
And it took forever to bring my change 
once it was realized that I was unhappy about the lack of professionalism and poor customer service.
Excuse me we are not in New York
and this is not a food truck.
I called at 8:14pm receipt says 8:17 
The girl said it would be ready in 20
Probably the same girl that walked by with her friends looked at me laughed with her friends went back inside and still no one came out.
Now its 8:56
I come In and see my food just sitting there.
No one is trying to help me, just looking at me like I'm bothering them.
Then Mr Balding Prison Snitch with 
The Payton black football jersey acts 
like he's helping me by telling me he can't do anything including answering simple questions. He's just being Mikey right he said his name is Mike and he just works there.
Long story Long, I will never come back to this place even if its the last place in the desert.
I've been treated better by Trump supporters that hate Obama

{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday with a party of 8. Needless to say, they were not prepared for us and we got drinks and walked out after waiting too long just to order. Until they can get it together, when we visit Vegas, we will not visit for dinner."}
{"text":"My mother and I had a wonderful time here. Our waiter JENNIFER WAS AMAZINGGGGG! She was kind and reallly showed amazing customer service. She made me feel comfortable and I really do appreciate it. She was also very funny. Next time I come to macaroni grill I'll be asking for Jennifer!"}
{"text":"It been long time since visited any Romano Macaroni Grill. After this visit got reminded why not really huge fan or get really excited about the food at Romano. It like the three star say the food OK. I even went the way trying one of the newer items on the menu the blackened chicken parmesan. My last visit been that long forgot the last thing I tried off the menu. I came with my brother guys on Ohana dinner night. We ordered couple appetizers the fried calamari and fried zucchini. I only tried the fried calamari. I thought it was ok. Not that much fan of the breading feel like could use more seasoning. It was on the dried out side comes straight out of the fryer. The dipping sauces were ok two different ones. Neither one stood out. My entree would say again on whole the dish was ok. I really enjoyed the side of vermicelli pasta simple tossed in olive oil. The blackened chicken has nice seasoning but feel like slightly overcooked. The meat was not very moist throughout the outside especially felt like eating crust on pizza rather then chicken. The bread that complimentary always always been fan of! It was exactly same as remember hot, delicious, and love the fresh olive oil dip the bread in. Overall the food is ok.

The service on the other hand never had bad experience can think of. On this visit they were on point again. The waitress was on top of it the whole night. She was very friendly, attentive, and made dining experience great one. 

Another thing that always liked about Romano is the paper on top of all the tables or booths. The waiter or waitress signs there name on the paper once sit down greets you. Especially if you have kids of any age. It great way for kids keep busy and never know might bring out artistic side of them. I like the high ceiling with the hanging wire of lights adds different look to the interior. On this night talk about cranking up the air conditioner. I swear never been more relief get out in the Vegas night heat! lol!!"}
{"text":"I guess all restaurants have good days and bad, have been going for lunch now about twice a month and they seem to have improved since my last review, food is always hot, and taste is better. I always get the Caesar salad, it's always good, the bread sometimes not always soft, but not horrible. We have tried a lot off of lunch menu and haven't been disappointed once. Their prices are a bit high but then most Italian restaurants around here are, even Olive Garden which I refuse to ever go to again. So if like me you have not been for awhile time to give it another try."}
{"text":"Came here for a dat night with the hubby.

The service was okay. Guy was friendly but didn't really go out of his way. He did a great job at explaining a couple items for us.

I love that you can write on the table (its paper and i had a pen) Lol..

The food was good. Nothing to write home about. It hit the spot cause i hadnt had italian in a while. 

The place was full but you didnt have to wait to get a seat.

A bit pricey for what it is. I enjoy olive garden better"}
{"text":"Food great server sucked tho. Her name began with a D she wrote her name sloppy couldn't read it"}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant multiple times thinking it would get better. After last night I am finally done.

The food is decent, nothing to brag about. The service is what ruins it. It takes close to 20 minutes just to get a glass of water and place our order. Once we eventually received our food, we had no silverware. We literally had to get up and go ask the hostess to get someone over to our table so we could get utensils. Our food was already cold by the time we got it. We sat for another 25 minutes to wait for our bill. 

I would never recommend this place to anyone. The service is rude and dismissive. Do yourself a favor and go across the parking lot to Chillis."}
{"text":"Have eaten many times and never disappointed. Food is great as well as the service. The best is their lunch specials at $11.00! Bread is delicious, the salads and main courses as well.
I'll be there in June with my club, again."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and the staff was very attentive. My server was very knowledgeable about the menu and I ordered unknowingly something that is perfect for me. The manager stopped by after I drank my entire glass in three seconds, just to make sure I was being brought more. Clean as well."}
{"text":"Wow, lots of hate on here about this place. Gave me second thoughts about coming here, but we had coupons. Service was very good.  Food was reasonably good, but that's kind of what you expect from a chain. I had the chicken under a brick, and it was just fine.  I didn't care for what my Mom got (chicken scallopini, I think), but she likes that. My wife had the eggplant Parmesan and enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Traffic and access to the restaurant is terribly congested, but the food is worth the effort! 
Grace and I enjoyed dipping the warm Rosemary buttered ciabatta roll in the balsamic vinegar and oil while waiting for our meals...she had Mama's Trio, consisting of Lasagna, Chicken Marsala on angel hair pasta and Fettuccini Alfredo ...I ordered the pork chop plate with fig sauce and grilled veggies...the chop was at least 2 inches thick and grilled perfectly, melt-in-your mouth tender, juicy and the fig sauce was an awesome compliment! The grilled veggies and red potatoes were also done up very nice! 
Joey was our server and he did a great job! Thanks Joey!"}
{"text":"Five girls, two celebrating birthdays, invaded Macaroni Grill this evening.  Our waitress, Taylor, was very accomodating.  Its a solid menu with solid Italian food.  Its always good and it helped to have a 1/2 price bottle of wine at the table.  Taylor was attentive to our needs, questions, and the two birthday desserts were awesome.  Not sure what was going on in the kitchen area.  Lots of breaking glasses and/or plates with the help applauding.  Perhaps the boss was away and the mice will play????"}
{"text":"Never again. Constantly providing terrible customer service in an empty restaurant. I've given them plenty of opportunities but this time I'm done."}
{"text":"Been to this place last Friday for dinner. At first we were served with bread and olive oil. I ordered, \"Blood Orange Cosmo\" my husband ordered ,\"Sorrento Lemonade\"
they were OK!   
For main course we ordered Alfredo pasta and  Chicken Milanese. Pasta just ok! but 
Chicken Milanese was awesome seasoned perfect and well cooked. The portions are very big.
How can we leave Italian Restaurant  without Tiramisu but too much of Rum.
I am unhappy because of the service.,"}
{"text":"This place has been around for year's, and it use to be much better, but I have to say on my last visit is was average. They still do good business as it was crowded for a Thursday night. Our entrees included: chicken parm, lobster ravioli, and spaghetti. Decent food but I do remember better days from this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was okay - just the pasta seasoning was strange. It was extremely salty in some places and not in others. Our waiter was okay but for not seeming to be waiting on any other tables the speed of service was a bit slow. We asked for coffee creamer and it took about 10 minutes before it came. Additionally, after our meal we waited for about 15 minutes for our checks after agreeing that we were ready for them. After we got our checks they were wrong and mixed up with what everyone had. We didn't bother asking to fix it because we just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Just sad that instead of improving their menu they have made it worst. I liked the old flatbreads now they have \"Fatbreads\" marketing towards more crust. In reality is way less ingredients and more undercook raw though. They still have their happy hour and really like their $3 glass house red wine. But just upset their quality is getting lower and lower. I ordered their chicken Marsala and it was just drenched in oil. Sad to say but I gave up on them. Then once again there must be a reason for the horrible yelp rating of 2 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"First time coming to this location. And came for the sole purpose of trying their new express dinner(thanks to a buy one get one free coupon I got in my email). I gotta admit it's definitely a step forward for this chain who has gone down the hill in the last couple of years(honestly had not gone to this restaurant since they changed their flat breads to their new \"artisan pizzas\" which are gross). I had their Chicken Milanese Panzella. I gotta admit it was truly delicious. A salad fried chicken fusion of sort. But I take one star off because you have to go to the counter on your own and order it yourself instead of ordering at your table. I get it for those to go times but not if your coming in to dine in the restaurant."}
{"text":"So I retuned to Mac Grill at Desert Ridge for first time in months, as I stopped going when they decided to tack on $5 for small salad with a dinner entrée-thought that a very bad idea.  Certainly the $5 did not change my lifestyle, but was an attitude thing which is a bad mistake.  Last night sat in bar, and was very good, but most importantly, if all servers and bar tenders were as dedicated to doing a terrific job like Mikey is in the bar, restaurants would not experience bankruptcy like Macaroni grill is now in.  Many restaurant owners and managers just do not get that the customer's experience is at least as important as the exact food served."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give zero stars. What an absolutely HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! My husband and I normally really enjoy eating at macaroni grill but this location may have ruined it for us. First of all, when we were seated it took 15 mins for us to even be greeted and that was after we finally got the attention of a waitress. After that, my husband immediately asked for the manager to complain about the poor customer service. The manager assured us that he was sorry and that we would be well taken care of, which did not happen!! I really love their Bibb and blue salad which was the only thing that made us stay to order. I ordered the blackened chicken parm and my husband ordered the penne rustica and my son ordered the pepperoni pizza. My chicken was UNDERCOOKED and my son's pizza taste burnt. Our waiter got the manager AGAIN who came and apologized and let us order something else. My son ordered chicken tenders and I reordered the chicken parm and told them to ensure it was cooked thoroughly. The manager brought out our new order and advised me that the chicken wasn't really raw, it was the marinade. As someone who cooks very regularly I think I know what raw chicken looks like! This meal was $54 what a waste! Oh at least they gave us a crumby piece of cheesecake for all of their mishaps. The manager here sucks and doesn't have good customer service. I would not recommend eating here unless you like poor service"}
{"text":"My experience here has been nothing but pleasant. Keep in mind that this is a chain, not a mom and pop shop, but the food exceeds chain quality and beats out Olive Garden by a thousand miles. 

The complimentary peasant bread is to-die-for. Crusty, soft, warm with rosemary. 
I'm usually quite satiated by the time my ordered food arrives. 

I will keep on coming back for the Penne Rustica. 
I love anything rosemary-the dish has a rosemary cream sauce w/ salty delicious prosciutto, chicken and shrimp. This dish doesn't tase like something that comes from a chain. 

Make sure to get some tiramisu to finish off. Bon apetit 

Ps. There is a gluten free menu and they have a create your own pasta if none on the menu appeals to you."}
{"text":"I did not expect much from the Macaroni Grill and was surprised.  Nice ambiance, good service, and food that as a whole better than I expected.  One often finds restaurants like this that as a whole look great but on the whole really aren't much more than a glorified Denny's.   That's not so bad if you are at Deny's but the Macaroni Grill's location and prices are such that they should be a more than a 
bit different."}
{"text":"After a series of bad customer service experiences lately, can I just say how relieving it was to have a positive experience?  Especially since it was for my birthday.  So here's the scoop; we went to Mac Grill in Goodyear for my birthday dinner.  It was my husband, myself, and 3 kids.  Our waitress was Katie.  No lie, she is probably one of the best waitresses/servers we've had in a very long time.  She was very personable, asked permission to order the kids sodas, would kneel down to get my son's order, and just overall was on her stuff.  Food was ordered in a timely manner, accurate, and came out hot.  She kept the refills coming.  Food was delish, of course.  Prices have gone up since the last time we ate there but that's across the board everywhere.  Overall, a great experience and if a manager is reading this, give Katie a shout out.  She's a gem of a server.  Seriously, it's becoming so rare now to find GREAT servers."}
{"text":"Slow service but the food was excellent.  We had the zuchinni appetizer, eggplant parmigiano, seafood pasta, and lasagna.   All were fabulous."}
{"text":"A nice evening with friends in AZ for our \"Date Nite\" away from their kids for the evening and a movie to follow we couldn't decide on the right place for dinner so we settled on yet another corporate restaurant, you see in-n-out, Denny's, McDonalds, Starbucks, and waffle house where all in our wake, but this was a step up for our track record and since our friends had been making the choices we just went with it once again. 

The Macaroni Grill is a nice setting with full bar, beer and wine options plus a decent selection of different foods on the menu. The server was great and prompt. We split Mama's Trio so as not to over indulge after a long unhealthy Thanks Giving weekend and I got the Pinot Noir de crema which I enjoyed. Mama's trio was a sample of chicken parmigiana, lasagna and a chicken canaloni with the parmigiana the best of the three, lasagna was burnt and the flavors were just OK but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Love the fresh baked bread with olive oil. Nice  menu to choose from and the waiters are always  friendly.  Food is usually ok. I think that the food quality has changed  in the past few years. Last visit  I did not enjoy  much. The kitchen was not clean ( could see while waiting  in line) and the cook touched  the food with hands."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great customer service! I was not totally satisfied with a new dish that I tried and the manager came to the table and    not only made an excellent suggestion but took my food back to the kitchen and implemented the suggestion. I took it home and was very pleased. Bottom line is if you value your customers you go to great lengths to keep them coming back. This is a great place to eat and good food too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love the caprese salad and egg plant Parmesan. Daren, my server was excellent. He was very attentive and came to check if I needed anything without coming to often."}
{"text":"We tried the Express Dinner.  The only service we received was the waiter brought us water and bread, we asked for the Express Dinner, he showed us to the Express counter, and we never saw him again because he was too busy hovering over a large table the rest of the time we were there. Worst service ever! Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Macaroni grill is great for to go ordering.  They are fast and always ready with my order when I get there.  Also a great atmosphere in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The best part about this visit was the server. He was polite and had a great sense of humor! The food was low quality. The fried macaroni ball thing was too greasy and completely falls apart. The pasta tasted like something I could make at home. The lobster ravioli was lacking flavor, however, it was cooked well. The service was really slow and I would not go back if it were my choice."}
{"text":"I knew going in here that this was a pasta joint- but what I find interesting is that there is no macaroni on the menu!!  :(

My hubs and I got both ordered simple pasta- nothing so awesome that I can even remember was it was.  The restaurant was super slow so the service was good.  Our waiter Jeff was very attentive.

Best part of the meal has got to be the paper on the tables and the crayons provided.  We killed time between ordering and eating with playing hangman on the table.  The fact that this was the best part of the meal is not saying much about the food- but it was okay."}
{"text":"Amazing in every way!!!! Service was phenomenal!!! Lamad was extremely knowledgable and very helpful with advice and suggestions!! Food was delicious!!! From the appetizers to the entrees! No wait on Christmas Eve for dinner! Food came out fast! Atmosphere was nice and comfortable! The crayons to use on the tablecloth was kind of fun. All around impressive, we'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here on August 30, 2016 and ordered one of the $10.99 lunch specials.  I got the spicy penne which came with a small but delicious fried mozzarella morsel served on dollop of red sauce and a side salad.  Warm, crusty bread is served & replenished throughout the meal.  The bread is excellent.  Service was good and the entire place looked and felt very clean and adequately staffed.  The pasta was wonderful and the sauce nicely flavored.  My one negative comment would be the tiny bit of fried mozzarella served with the meal.  Surely two or three pieces of cheese should be served with a meal as an appetizer as one is an insanely tiny bit of food to put on a plate and call it a 'course.' 
The food here is consistently good, though, so I continue to return."}
{"text":"Another ritual huge restsaurant, mega wait, loud Gilbert eating experience, a little better than the others since: service was more quick and attentive (seems to have a less waitress/customer ratio).  Food decent but with the volume you end up eating more than intended, and it was a little heavy."}
{"text":"Came here for a work meeting. We were all there about an hour or so, and my water glass was only filled once, after we finished our meal and paid the bill. I only ordered water, so for me to go the entire lunch without my glass filled was really crappy. Plus, everyone for their food in a decent amount of time except one. It took an additional 15 min for him to get his meal (a salad mind you) which by the time he got it, our food was cold."}
{"text":"Husband & I went here for Valentine's dinner. It was a last resort due to the show storm (we had reservations in Little Italy) & we didn't want to leave Strongsville. We almost just went to taco bell due to the low rating this place received but I wanted something decent so we decided to be adventurous lol.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table. Once we were seated the service was prompt. 
  We got an $45 bottle of wine that was awesome! Our apps & salads came out quick. We waited a little bit longer for our meal but the place was packed. The meals came out hot & both tasted good. We were pleasantly surprised and will return."}
{"text":"This is a review of several visits I have made to this establishment.
It is hit or miss. Usually they are 4 or 5 stars. My last visit was a 1, and thus the average dropped significantly. We went at about 6:00PM on a Saturday night. 
This one let me down on my last visit.

The food was cold. Luke warm at best...and one of the items was soup...and it was one of the specials of the day. Seriously soup? I think they put it in the bowl and it sat on the counter for 30 minutes before it was brought to the table. We had two orders and they were both cold. Also ordered the pork chop special. When it arrived it was cold/luke warm as well. The risotto was not cooked enough and cold. The pork chop was kind of tough. Not juicy and tender like the server promoted it to be. My dinner companion's food was also cold. It also looked like it sat out for awhile. and had give away glazed look to it.

Very disappointing. I do not know who's fault it is... the kitchen for not timing the dishes or the server not bringing the food out when it is ready. My back was to the kitchen so I could not see it come up to know for sure. I suspect the server as he reported they were putting the finishing touches on one of the appetizers and it didn't make it to the table for 20 minutes after his last update. 
 
Note to servers: Don't put your hands in your hair and play with your zipper. Dude, you are serving food!!

Overall, I find MGs food salty which requires frequent drink refills...our server kept up on that nicely. 
 
Because it is so close to home, I am sure I will be back, as other visits were not so disappointing. Lunch seems to be the best time to go to this location based on past experiences and I would put them at 4 to 5  stars."}
{"text":"We've sort of given up on Macaroni Grill but gave them another try, because our grown kids had fond memories and wanted to come here a few weeks back. That was a good evening. 

So with no drama I say, yesterday was a huge mistake. 

Everything that could go wrong, did. Wrong orders, forgetful service, poorly prep'd food that was horrible and at times we were completely forgotten. I could could go, but."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience in my entire life at this restaurant. We were the only table in the entire restaurant the whole hour. Our server, Vivian, was absent along with the rest of the many employees huddled in the back of the restaurant laughing & chatting it up. Our food came out sparse & poorly cooked. I had to send one meal back because it was outright cold. Our servers attention was impossible to get. Our drinks went unfilled. Dirty dishes were scattered across our table even though I did my best to stack them. During the entire hour I saw my server three times. I watched her glance over at the table & make no effort to walk over. When I sent my food back to be reheated, in any respectable restaurant, the manager would have came over and apologized or at least asked how we were doing. While I ate my one biter mozzarella (which was actually considered to be one course of the three course meal. HA!) I found something round and hard which felt like it nearly broke my tooth as I bit into it. It took more time to get my servers attention & get the bill than it did to actually eat my food. Frustrated with my service I asked to see the manager once we received the check. The manager made me wait to see him. Then when he came out he gave no apologies as I explained to him my experience in a calm manner. I never once raised my voice & he offered no discount to our bill. He was impolite & unsympathetic. I also couldn't believe that the server stood beside him listening in as to what I had to say and made smirks as I talked. I've worked in restaurants before and have seen many managers treat guests--clearly trying to get their meal for free--with more dignity than I received today."}
{"text":"Wait time for table: Perfect, no wait.
Hostess: Raven, awesome. 
Bread: Yummy.
Servers: Friendly, forgetful. Never saw a manager to back them up out front.
Speed of service: Slow. 
Taste of food: Didn't really matter, lost appetite.
Would go back: No."}
{"text":"I go here weekly because it never fails! Always the best! food and service is perfect! James at the bar is the nicest.. Any issues they jump right on it! Nick the manager is always walking around talking to customers. And the wine is FINE!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday a few weeks ago.... The staff is friendly and food was great. I had chicken pasta and the crab stuffed mushrooms and calamari. No complaints here..."}
{"text":"I had the Pork Chop and Risotto OMG so good!"}
{"text":"Came in for a family dinner Saturday night. My kids think it's fun to write on the table. We play hang man every time. We each take turns with the next word. 

It was pretty crowded. Lots of cute teens having dinner before prom. But even still, we were there at the exact time, a table had opened up right away in the middle of isle. Or we could have waited for a booth with everyone else but we were ok with the sitting. 

Our server was over booked with tables. She was running around like crazy. Which I didn't let it get me upset since I could tell how busy it was. As long as my kids had fun and the food was tasty I was gona get over it. I won't lie, a little more attention from her would've been nice but what can I do now. In the past. 

The point is that we did have a good time and the food was good.  We will certainly return if we are in the area and in the mood for some classic Italian food."}
{"text":"So I used to go here all the time at absolutely the wrong time... when it was PACKED.  It is NO fun when it's packed. The tables are very close together and it makes for a lot of noise and the servers are tripping on everything.

So, tip... go when it's not busy, like lunch.  Or a non-weekend evening.

What's cool about the Macaroni Grill is the paper on the table.  Great for children and great for \"I'll-never-grow-up\" adults.  My husband and I had a blast drawing silly things, like fire breathing chickens of DOOM. :-)

The menu:

The spinach and artichoke dip is to die for.  I love my artichoke dip and those other places can get pretty bland. This one is NOT bland.

I had the lobster ravioli... very nicely HOT and tasty.

My hubby had one of the chicken dishes... which was tasty as well.

Service was good... it was pretty dead in the place so, clearly that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Marshea!!! Best waitress we have ever had!! best service we have ever had!  she made us things that they didn't have on the menu. wonderful service we will definitely be going back to see her she works at the bar or in the patio!"}
{"text":"I agree with David - stay home, make your own pasta dish, you'd be happier!!!   

The olive oil tasted like old oil, the bread was good, but the dishes? *Sigh* 
I ordered egg plant parmesan. The noodles were soggy and way over cooked, The salad were okay buy definitely does not worth the money.  Egg plants were  soggy too, the bread crust made it tasted like bread in bad oil, yuck! I barely finished one piece. My husband was disappointed with his chicken pasta as well.  You see a bowel of pasta but two slices of chicken. The check was $40 total. Not worth it! Go somewhere else, save you money, if not, save your taste buds."}
{"text":"If you want genuine kindness, ask for Julie! She's the sweetest server we've had here. Legitimately will come back and ask for her every single time. Food was bomb, as usual. But the service took it to the next level!"}
{"text":"I started eating at Macaroni Grill when I moved to AZ in 1998... back in the days of the big jug of wine on the \"honor system\" when you could catch a good buzz for $4 a person!  I've always had a great dining experience here including good service, great food, fun atmosphere and an overall solid value.

I ate in the bar last night and had the Grilled Chicken Spedini (see pic) which was a perfect meal of grilled chicken skewers (2) marinated in olive oil, garlic, lemon and rosemary served over grilled vegetables and roasted potatoes, delicious, light and healthy at $9.99.  I love their focaccia bread with olive oil for dipping.  It was very busy which is usually the case on a Friday night.  The service was solid, and I will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"Honestly haven't been to a MG in a long time. Arrived around 6pm on Saturday to a short wait. Since I was traveling alone it was easy to grab a seat at bar. Friendly bar staff but had to ask a few times for simple things like more water, check and togo container. The side Caesar I received also had more croutons than dressing. I also felt that my fettuccine Alfredo sat in the window too long since it was congealed when I received it. Tasted fine overall. Bread delicious. Good 4-7 happy hour. I might give them another try."}
{"text":"I'm only going to give it two Star in stead pf one because the servers were nice not really great at the job but nice. ( she brought me the wrong salad didn't enev give my spouse his options and would forget what we asked for so we would have to ask multiple times.) We ordered the Carmela chicken and lasagna and both lacked any flavor and look like they came out of microwavable dinner box. Highly annoyed because I work very hard and wanted to take my family out to a good dinner but it made me wish I would have rather just stop by fast food joint. I really wish I read the reviews. They need a better cook asap."}
{"text":"Atrociously poor service, and it wasn't the least bit busy. Our waiter was friendly enough when Mom and I sat down, but we were soon abandoned for a bigger table. Completely abandoned without even a word. We have found vastly superior service at the Olive Garden in Downtown Summerlin, on much more chaotic nights.

Our food was the only saving grace. But the service was severely lacking. Not just at our table-in our entire area. Our whole side was left unserviced for far too long. Now remember: it was not busy. There's far superior service at the Olive Garden in Summerlin, on nights where the place is jam packed.

Plus the place was a little chilly.

Not worth the time or money. I wish we had gotten the meal for free."}
{"text":"We love this location, but today's service specifically stood out. Our waiter, Grant, gave us prompt and friendly service above and beyond our usual experiences. Both my girlfriend and I were very impressed with his delightful attitude and perfect customer service. His recommendation of the chicken Caesar calzoneto was especially tasty. Thank you for the outstanding effort and please keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, very reasonable prices, great wait staff. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken salad is to die for. I think I'll try a pizza next time -- was lusting over that all night.

We met here Tuesday night (6/30) for an RWA meeting (first month here) -- and my hat's off to all of you. You handled a busy, talkative crowd with great senses of humor and kindness.

Looking forward to meeting at your location from now on. Great job!"}
{"text":"By far the worst experience at Macaroni Grill that we've ever had. For starters we had to ask for bread twice and when we finally got it, we didn't even have starter plates. Next we waited on our server multiple times, server never came by after food was served, wife's pasta noodles were undercooked and her portion size was made for a kid. We always order same thing so usually everything is pretty much the same not including this time. Last but not least, it seemed like everyone hated their lives minus hostess and weren't happy to help any customers. Also the cooks were banging stuff around which didn't help the experience.

We won't be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Future customers should be advised that five of my friends were seriously ill with FOOD POISONING from eating at this Macaroni Grill last Sunday!!! It is strongly advised NOT to eat at this particular Macaroni Grill until serious health/cleanliness issues are addressed!!! 

If I could, I'd give this establishment NEGATIVE STARS!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant.  But it's a good one.  The happy hour here is great.  It's not too crowded if you just want to relax and have a good conversation.  You can pour your own wine from the chianti jug (on your honor) so you can have a half glass, split a glass, whatever.  I used to work at a Macaroni Grill over 20 years ago and I had no hesitation going here.  That has to count for something... and for me it counts for a lot!  I've worked in too many restaurants and bars that I would never go back to eat in.  Just be careful, the rosemary bread and olive oil may have a negative impact on your waist line!  It's delicious... and who doesn't love free bread and butter?!?!"}
{"text":"A chain restaurant can be the perfect spot when the service is great.   The bar tender Mike really takes care of his customers.  We get great deals for signing up on their website so we come in on Thursday nights to get the half price wine bottles. 
We sit in the bar area to be served by Mike.  He handles a busy bar area very well.   Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great place on Sunday for a reasonably priced brunch. They have $2 mimosas or bloody Mary's. They offer a special brunch menu or you can order from the full menu. Some menu favorites would be the bibb & blue salad, sausage rigatoni, chicken scallopine and butternut squash tortllacci. If you happen to sit in the bar, ask for Mikey. He will make your dining experience even more special."}
{"text":"We went there with a large party at 1pm and the service was terrible!! Plus my chicken scallopine dish gave me 3 tiny overcooked pieces of chicken. At least charge a lunch price if your giving a child portion of food, not $15 for this. Plus this didn't come with a salad either. It was not that good like years ago I remember it. The only plus side was the rosemary infused bread. My friend didn't get his drink for over 40 minutes. No more for this place."}
{"text":"I guess this review isn't very \"fair\" since its from an experience over a year old, but maybe nothing's changed? Perhaps, it has.. Either way, here is my experience..

My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner around 7pm. He got chicken pasta-something-something and I got the fettucine alfredo (I know--they put this one the menu to point out who's bland when it gets ordered). The bread they brought out was good and the boyfriend even tried to take a loaf of it home, but wound up leaving it on the table. Our meals were good, albeit overpriced for what they were. 

The service was good. I cannot, for the life of me, remember our waitress' name, but she was a very sweet girl who made sure glasses stayed full and we stayed happy. Granted, I saw *maybe* two other couples having dinner at that time. 

It was a good experience.
Not great... just... good. 
Three stars, Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"Terrible Service... It took a few minutes just to be greeted by the Host.
Food was ok..."}
{"text":"After taking the toddler out to Chuck E Cheese yesterday, the wife and I had a huge craving for Indian and decided to have lunch at Sutra on McDowell. Of COURSE, they were closed. I suggested instead that we check out Romano's because I'd had a fairly decent experience at the I-17 and 101 location a couple of weeks ago with a friend, and the wife's a bit of an Olive Garden freak. So in we went. And I'm sorry to say that the experience this time wasn't all that good. It wasn't all that BAD either, but a flatline three stars is pretty much all this place gets. 

Regarding the food: the wife had the sausage spiedini (basically just grilled sausage and vegetables), and I had the chicken scallopini. Kid had the mac and cheese. I asked for extra roasted garlic on mine, and it was very garlicky and delicious - in fact the scallopini sauce was so awesome that I vowed to try my hand at making it at home sometime soon. Also it was very salty - boosted, no doubt, by the prosciutto. What I didn't much care for was the portion size - it was definitely enough for a lunch portion, but those looking to take leftovers for later will be disappointed. I got maybe a soup-ladle's worth of angelhair pasta with it. Not worth $12.99, that's for damn sure. Maybe just over half that. The wife's experience was somewhat less exciting - she didn't like the sausage, the grilled veggies were just meh and overall she said it wasn't something she would ever order again. Bread was okay, but wasn't as good as OG's breadsticks. Toddler didn't eat most of his mac and cheese, although it's hit and miss with him on most things anyway (unless it's boston cream pie yoghurt with frickin' sprinkles on it) so I won't \"review\" his meal here.

Romanos tries to give off some kind of upper-class dining atmosphere, a la Olive Garden. At OGs, it seems to work. Not here. For us, the vibe was lessened by the sleeveless-shirt-wearing Hispanic guy who came in shortly after us, and especially by the weird music mix they were playing - elevator piano music, switching to big band stuff, and then inexplicably to a tune that sounded like Alvin the Chipmunk on a ukelele. I commented to the wife that that particular track reminded me of something from one of our toddler's toys. And there were the little things, too - chewing gum stuck under our booth table, the fact that our bottle of olive oil was almost completely empty, the fact that the server just threw the kids menu onto the table in front of our toddler without a word. We're still at three stars. 

The waitress, Melody, was completely disinterested. Seemed okay at first, but she was just not perky at all. Maybe because she had to work on the weekend. She took forever to get back to us for things, including when we had our credit card waiting on the table for her. And when we finally got the bill back ready to sign, we just got a monotone \"thanks and have a good day\". Up to that point, we had. (shrug) Maybe I'm just spoiled - she acted pretty normal for a server in a regular old Australian restaurant, but since moving to the US I now kind of expect my sack to get tickled with a feather a little more during my dining experience, know what I mean? Yes, the manager did show up during the meal to get a status check on us, but even that visit seemed like a chore they had to get over and done with.

All in all, a meh experience at a meh restaurant with overpriced meals. Look at their menu and check out how much they charge for an 8oz filet. $28. AYFKM?!

I'd probably eat here again, I suppose. If someone else paid."}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill is a nice please to stop in and grab dinner or lunch. The staff is always very friendly and I love the food and reasonable pricing. My only complaint was a very strange smell next to the bar/bathroom area. It was horrible but they told me it was a sewage issue and it was being fixed. I'm still giving this place 4 stars because it's great foood just one small problem that should be fixed soon."}
{"text":"Late entry: Birthday celebration on April 14th was spectacular! Great food, nice time with the family & our server, WES, helped make wonderful memories. Definitely going back :))"}
{"text":"Recently ate at Macaroni Grill at Desert Ridge, went with friends and drank wine and ate light, just grilled veggie platter with rosemary bread. It was so delicious. The veggies were grilled perfectly, very flavorful, the bread was perfect dipped in olive oil with pepper. We drank the family wine which is the house Chianti you pour yourself. Had a perfect evening, stayed almost 3 hours. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Awesome Service. Nice ambience. Customize your options as per what you want. Good Italian food"}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill seems a bit overpriced for what you get however I still enjoy going now and again. The atmosphere is always relaxing and a few steps about The Oilive Garden. The bread is always delicious, the house wines are terrific, and the paper table cloth and crayons bring out the kids in us.  

During this visit the service was pleasant and attentive. The food was consistent, consistently good.  I had the chicken parm and the others in my group had eggplant. We all enjoyed the dishes.

If you are looking for a different take on Italian fare, do give them a shot."}
{"text":"So sad the last time we were At Romano's macaroni Grill the food was very bland we ordered the ricotta meatballs and spaghetti and I know damn well these meatballs did not have ricotta in them...I come from and Italian family very strong Italian family.... and the meatballs to be honest with you tasted like frozen meatballs that you just warm up and the sauce was very bland I was just very disappointed because I remember back in the day when macaroni grill first opened it was so amazing but lately it's just so bland and I don't know why keep going back..Don't get me wrong there are a few good things on the menu but I could've made better Spaghetti and meatballs their meatballs were very bland and I know damn well there was no ricotta inside of those meatballs at all they were dry and they were tasteless"}
{"text":"When arrived out server let us know there was a wait due to a party of 50 and two cooks not showing. As we were not in a hurry we decided to stay. We ordered the tasters menu. Appetizers of fried ravioli was great. Salads were as expected. The main course was disgusting. Potatoes were in a bed of salt, the beef tasted like dog food and the chicken had no seasoning at all. The other issue is my husbands meals would be cold and mine were hot. The worst thing was when I went to the restroom while waiting for the bill. There were two employees cleaning the restroom. They cleaned the last stall, put their things away, and walked out of the restroom without washing their hands. Food can be chalked up to a bad night but there is no excuse for not being clean. Will not go to this place again."}
{"text":"For the past year I've been wanting to return here and my girlfriend has always talked me out of it.  Let me start this review by saying:  I should have listened!

I used to love the Macaroni Grill in California (Westlake Village) and was expecting this one to be on par.  It was not.  

It took OVER 35 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, it was not good.  How freeking hard is it to cook pasta?!  Not very.  The restaurant was not particularly crowded but it seemed like we were waiting forever!  As I eagerly dug in to my pasta, I was immediately underwhelmed.  I guess the pasta iteself was okay, but the toppings and chicken were really not good.

While this is far from an expensive restaurant, it does cost enough for me to expect a good meal that is well prepared.  

I'll probably never go back - and I'm sure my girlfriend won't want to."}
{"text":"The service was lousy. Server kept scratching her armpits and body without washing her hands and served foods minutes later."}
{"text":"Not bad, for a chain restaurant.  Nicer ambiance than Olive Garden but also no free salad and breadsticks.  The $5 house wines are served in rather large non-wine glasses.  The bread was pretty good and I like how you get to dip it in olive oil.  The Eggplant Parmesan was delicious.  

The service was also good... Make that brisk.  Everything happened so quickly that my friend and I ended up staying a while after we were done because we hadn't had much time to catch up by the time we got our bill.  

Unfortunately, we were seated right next to the open kitchen, which turned out to be really loud.  I honestly don't care to hear every time someone's food is \"up.\"  And I think it was rude of them to dump us in that noisy spot, considering there were tons of other open tables."}
{"text":"We stopped here last evening with lowered expectations, to relax and have a quiet dinner.

Macaroni a Grill when it was owned by Norman Brinker's company (Chili's, Maggiano's, On The Border) was one of our family's staple and \"go to\" restaurants. The food was good, creative and most of all, it was a fun place to go on a Saturday night.  

Well, Macaroni Grill and On The Border were sold in 2008 and things sort of went down hill after that. You never knew how good the food or service would be from one visit to the next. 

The new managed team tried to cut corners, downsizing portion on new, smaller serving plates, etcetera. But it didn't work and they were forced to close several locations and ultimately had to sell the chain. Ugh!

But after our visit last evening, we're going to give them a second chance. 

The food was good and their Chicken Parmigiana (photo) was as we remembered it. Excellent. 

Service was slow, but our server Brian kept us informed, which we appreciated. Macaroni Grill seems to be back and yes, they were moderately crowded too.  They have also added a side Caesar Salad with your dinner, something that use to be a $3 up-charge. 

We also noticed they are advertising a Happy Hour now. Nice!

Our tab came to just under $50, with two glasses of wine. It included taxes, but before gratuities. Interestingly, that's very close to our meal cost from my Yelp Review four years ago. 

Not bad, not bad at all. We'll be back. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE!!! Food was hot & delicious. Ask for server named RED she's awesome!"}
{"text":"Gathering place to share, to meet, to know, to get to know.  This dinner was a celebration of past, present and future for a sweet young barely 25 year old woman (who calls me Aunt Suzie - known her since she was a baby) who battled breast cancer & went into complete remission this past month. 

Many people & cultures \"define events through food\" & associate food with feelings and identity. In ancient times, sharing one's meal symbolized hospitality and goodwill.  If one was breaking bread with someone, it indicated friendship, truce, fellowship, an alliance, & harmony. And I can't think of a holiday that doesn't center around or end in eating!  

Therefore, celebratory meals will always remain part of human culture.  And this dinner at Romano's Macaroni Grill was truly celebratory!

Romano's Macaroni Grill-Gold Dust management (especially Chris & Tim) & staff handled our large party of nearly 50 people in an exemplary manner. 

I was amazed by how smoothly the whole evening flowed (from when I arrived & escorted to check in table in back to a semi enclosed banquet room) & how well organized they handled such a large group in conjunction with H.O.W.  Helping One Woman-Scottsdale Chapter (honoring one woman who's had a devastating loss in past 12 months) 'Girls' Night Out', on the third Tuesday of every month. 

I was presented with 3 main entree choices with salad, bread, non-alcoholic drink, tax & tip for such an amazingly great price.  They even extended their happy hour prices with their glasses of wine with their signature honor system. If you needed anything or special requests/changes; they immediately with friendly professionalism took care of it.  My food was delicious. 

They even donated a very impressive RAFFLE prize (red & white bottles of wine with a large bottle of olive oil). WOW!!  Seriously impressed with their caring & professionalism.  

Will definitely recommend them for large parties, get togethers or fund raisers. Plus they have great specials like their Express Dinner Counter 'dine in' or to go $9 in 9 minutes or it's free."}
{"text":"I wish I had read some of these reviews before visiting this establishment.  if I could give them a 0 star for lack of customer service, and for the absolute worst dining experience I have ever had I would.

If you want to be ignored by your wait staff, have cold food served to you, have a manager completely brush your concern off, and be treated like you are non-existent,  the Romano's Macaroni Grill on Litchfield in Goodyear AZ is the perfect restaurant for you.

Don't, i repeat, just don't go.  You'll be better off going hungry for the night."}
{"text":"Macaroni grill is one of the less offensive chain restaurants, both in name and quality it's much better than the Apostrophe S's of the world.  It's one of my family's favorite places to go so I end up here a lot.

It's a restaurant that I'm in a food rut at.  I don't mean to be, but I've found the things that I like and I like them so much and are so surprised that they're served in a chain that I can't bring myself to try anything else for fear of disappointment.

For starters, I always need some of their Brick Oven Formaggio.  Melted, bubbly mozzerella and parmesan bread crisps with either chicken or sausage and pepperoni - this stuff is awesome.  Since it's, you know, cheese and meat it's pretty heavy so it's great for sharing.  Also, I usually can't help but sample some of the rosemary bread dredged in the cheese as well.

For my entree, I always always always get the shrimp portofino.  If you're a shrimp lover like I am, especially if you like scampis, this is a delightful dish.  Shrimp sauteed in a light lemon butter sauce and served with linguine, pine nuts, mushrooms and spinach - it really is just a great, simple dish."}
{"text":"Definite changes to this place. New ownership. New recipes. Same great service... We haven't been here for a couple of months but we definitely noticed. Took a minute to adjust to the new menu and options. My boyfriend enjoyed the spicy meatballs and his loaded fries. The bib & blue salad was noticeably different. Did not care for the new and improved salad...blah. Bread was good but Olive oil taste different. My boyfriend went for the butter option after tasting the oil. My eggplant Parmesan was delicious. The blood orange martini was great."}
{"text":"We ate in the bar.  Food was great but service was even better.  Our waitress/bartender  (Holly) was amazing.  Had the chef make us something to order based upon my request. Also extended happy hour to make sure we got another glass of wine with our dinner at happy hour prices. Thanks Holly."}
{"text":"We loved it here. The service was excellent and the food also. Even better the price was very affordable. I look forward to trying it again"}
{"text":"Good food and a good show! Haha if you go, ask to be seated by the kitchen. It was amazing to see how quickly the chef was working. He was obviously skilled, and had a rhythm going. The other cooks just sorta stood around and watched him as he ran circles around them. The funniest part is how he totally shut down the expediter (who was a huge asshole btw). If I had any cash I would have tipped the chef, he kept his cool while producing an incredible amount of food and having to work with an asshole. 

The reason for 4 stars, was for cleanliness of the bathroom. There was a prom party there, and a girl got sick and threw up all over one of the stalls. When the staff came in to clean it, they just complained, made very rude comments, and said how gross it was, right in front of the girl who got sick. And rather than clean it up, she just wrote a \"out of service\" note on the door."}
{"text":"I used to go to Romano's Macaroni Grill 2 or 3 times a month when I lived in N. Texas and always had a great experience but not so much since moving out west.  

On the plus side - the food was OK, not great but OK.  The dinner salad was a bit wilted but fair - nothing special but again, OK.  

The area that could have been a LOT better was the service.  The restaurant was pretty much empty (very empty) so it wasn't like they were jammed up but it was like our waiter simply forgot us.  We got our water and drinks but then nothing.  After my drink was delivered our waiter did not come back till our drinks were long gone and when he did decide to show up we were not asked if we would like another round of drinks.  

The kitchen did a great job, the food was great, fresh and out to the table promptly.  

Funny, although the food was good (not great), fresh and a reasonable price, the thing that you remember the most about a place is the lousy service.   If the service had been okay, I would have given it at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"No complaints. Greg was our server. He was very professional, upbeat, and very attentive. The customer service ment a lot to me. I will continue to come back and enjoy this wonderful restaurant. Food was delicious,  prices were great."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst experience I have had in a restaurant in 10 years...if I could give no stars I would.  It was mother's day so my husband mother and I stopped for dinner.  We were pleasantly surprised there was no wait and that's the only good thing that happened in the 2 hours we were there with NO FOOD.  The manager dissappeared as our waitresse's 3 tables all walked out due to the lady running take out demanding her orders took presidence... Never will I go back again...thanks for being the WORST"}
{"text":"Mike The best service and manager very good,lamb chops perfect thanks for good food. Enzo"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening and had a great time! The food came out quickly and our server Gus, was wonderful! Highly recommend if you're looking for good Italian food :)"}
{"text":"I Magnificent dinner, really enjoyed their rosemary bread, I can't remember how many baskets we ate but we could not satisfied our hunger and desire from this style of bread, simply delicious. I had a sampler trio deal to which I was really amazed over the taste and quality of ingredients used! The price was decent and the food at least to me was better than at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Quick for pick up! My daughter doesn't eat much so we got kids meals  ciabatta bread was a bit crunchy but for $5.50 she got a decent meal"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible!!! My boyfriend and I went there for lunch last Saturday and I should have known it would be bad due to the fact that we were the only people there at 12:30pm. I ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup, he had some type of calzone. I'm quite sure the soup was several days old, my sandwich wasn't even fully toasted with soggy buttered bread on the outside and un-melted cheese inside. His calzone had something resembling bacon but was more like 50yr old jerky. Everything about our meal was completely inedible. When we tried to explain to the manager, we were accused of trying to obtain a free meal! We honestly didn't shwallow a single bite.. I very much enjoy writing good reviews, and in Michigan the macaroni grill was one of my favorite restaurants, I was thrilled to see one here. This location isn't worth your time or a dime. I've also contacted thier corporate office."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Good drinks, friendly staff, & fast service. The bar tender was funny and made some great recommendations on the door. Normal chain Italian food style. Nothing horrible or overly exiting."}
{"text":"I can not complain about the chicken marsala..DELICIOUS! A very good size portion made fresh. 
Our server was a little annoying but he was attentive LOL.
 I will return but not often as it is pricey."}
{"text":"I can see why this restaurant has 3 stars and I wish I would have read the reviews before coming here. Our server was so rude on the verge of intimidating.  Our drinks were empty for almost the entire meal and we didn't even want to ask for refills because he was so rude. He never asked how our food was or even spoke to us really. I thought okay maybe he is having a bad night and everyone is entitled to some of those, but then I heard him at the table behind us being very friendly and providing great customer service, so I knew that wasn't it. The only thing I can think is that we were not the same ethnicity as him, but those guests were. Disappointing and after our appetizers we just asked for a to go box to box up our entree and leave. 

On top of all this, the food was mediocre including mac and cheese balls that were literally ice cold because they were still frozen on the inside."}
{"text":"My family and I used to go to MG all the time, and I always remember it being delicious. It's been a few years, so this outing was a huge surprise to me. My husband got the lamb chop, a $25 plate, but what came was not worth $25. There were a total of 4 bites of lamb, the majority of the plate was potatoes and veggies. We felt ripped off. Also, there was a very long hair on my bowl that I unfortunately did not notice until I was done eating. And finally, the menu does not reflect what the actual pricing is - for example, it says your entree comes with a salad, but when I requested my salad, she said it costs extra and doesn't come on the side anymore. Why not change the menu to reflect this? The only redeeming factor was our waitress who was very attentive and kind. I wish we did not have this experience because I used to love MG, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"My first and probably last time here. Manager Heather at the host stand was initially very rude and made a stupid comment about not being able to guess how long it takes people to eat when we asked how long the wait was. 
Atmosphere was confusing, they want to be upscale casual in their food, but they put paper table covers and crayons on the tables, servers wear jeans.  
Tomato soup was gross - tasted like a bowl of marinara with some water mixed in, it was sent back. Table bread was overwhelmed with rosemary. Chicken alfredo was sub par, chicken rubbery, and sauce clumpy. 
Server was nice enough, had a positive attitude, but too little too late. We won't be back, we'll get better food at the same price at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"If you like the smell of raw sewage, this is the place for you! They've got the best raw sewage odor in all of Phoenix! Seriously, I have been to open pits in the Philippines that can't hold a candle to this place. I would advise that nobody light a match. Needless to say, we turned around and walked out. But not before mentioning something to the hostess (or possibly she was the manager) who appeared to be completely disinterested."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner. We were seated in the middle of the floor at a table, near an open and clean booth. The bread was dry and bland. Salad had barely any dressing. Waiter forgot wine until after he brought out entrees and was reminded. I ordered lobster ravioli which comes with shrimp. The shrimp was delicious. I found a lobster shell in the ravioli. My boyfriend ordered chicken Alfredo which was incredibly bland. Honestly, I would say Olive Garden is better than this restaurant. This was not at all what I expected for the price. Too expensive for sub par food and service. It wasn't dirty, or anything terrible."}
{"text":"I have to give this visit a 5 star rating because of Cathy.  She was very attentive, even though she told us she was recovering from knee surgery.  the food was delicious - I had the Pollo Caprese - delightful the grill marks made the chicken with a side green salad - so fresh.  My Mom had the Chicken Marsala which she couldn't get over.  The rosemary bread, always amazing.  Our drinks were never empty.  Just a nice overall, pleasant dining experience.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"To start off the waitress we had was absolutely great! Super positive and exuberant. We had a little issue with out food and the manager came out and fixed it off the ticket and apologized right away. However when we arrived at the restaurant we almost turned around and walked out because the hostess was absolutely horrible we stood there for 10 minutes while she flirted with all the male waiters. She was rude when she finally did seat us... I highly recommend a different person to help start your guest out at such a good restaurant."}
{"text":"The service and food were great. I had a limoncello martini which was phenomenal. The Caesar salad was delicious. A tad overdressed, but nothing to complain about. Bread was good. Chicken Parmesan fresh and flavorful. My only complaint was the sauce on the pasta was spicy so I had them make me more with a less spicy sauce, the manager came over and told me they use half \"zesty\" and half regular. However, they clearly used only zesty on mine and I felt his demeanor was kind of douchey for lack of a better term. I didn't ask for free food or a comp or make a scene, so there was no need for his attitude. But none the less it was yummy. Lost a star for the manager though. No clue why so many 1-2 star reviews."}
{"text":"Had I written this review about 8 years ago, I would have happily given this establishment a 5/5 review. Unfortunately, times have changed and the fairly recent revamping of the menu, cooking styles, and value has fallen short in recent years. 

Today my Dad was visiting and he wanted to take the kids to lunch. He had several gift cards to Romano's Macaroni Grill so off we went. We were greeted at the door by a very friendly hostess and seated immediately. If this review was strictly based on the service, I would have no problem giving them a 5/5. Unfortunately, the food quality alone takes this review to the 3/5 mark. 

The Rosemary bread and oil accompaniment was delicious as always. The service by Sandra was excellent on all levels. Quick to refill drinks and quick to bring additional bread as requested. 

The appetizers and main dishes, however, left much to be desired. My dad ordered two appetizers: one of stuffed mushrooms, which appeared to be extremely greasy and possibly frozen; and other of Calamari which was an extremely small serving and though tasty, were a bit over-fried. 

For my main course, I had the $10 3 course lunch special. It included a single triangle of fried cheese, a small Caesar salad, and a main dish which I picked the Fettucini Gorgonzola. Though it was okay, the cheese sauce was layered in oil and dripped off each piece of pasta, leaving me with a sunken stomach and an overall bloated feeling. 

It really seems like the quality of the food has taken a strong dive in recent years and it is because of the food quality alone that I must give them a 3/5."}
{"text":"I come here with my best friend on a regular basis  usually for a light lunch and some drinks.  

We have had 4 or 5 different servers over the last year and  they have always been friendly and willing to accommodate  any special requests or answer any questions. No one has been spectacular but all have been average or very good  and everyone has always been friendly and welcoming. 

The lunches typically are Italian Tapas or lunch specials, soup and salad. 

I have had pasta dishes on occasion and they are just OK. The tapas, soup salad and bread have been pretty good Light and flavorful especially on a summer day.  Perfect for a light lunch and talking. 

The wine  and cocktail menu is a decent selection for a chain and tend to have a good variety of flavors. 

The food I would give close to 3-3.5 stars. It is in a great shopping center. Ulta  and Pier 1 for her and Total Wine for me."}
{"text":"So a co-worker & I decided for our lunch hour, we would treat ourselves to the Macaroni Grill...big mistake. We walk in about 11:10 am looking around for someone to greet us, finally she comes and seats us saying out waitress will be right with us. Well the chick never came. The couple that was standing in the parking lot talking, came in after we were already seated, they gave their drink order AND SERVED their drinks while we sat there still waiting! Looking around for our waitress or somebody to come over, we both noticed the iPads they use to place orders were covered with finger prints as if they've never been wiped down before. Macaroni Grill really shouldn't have those under direct lights of they aren't going to add that to their daily cleaning. That was gross to look at. We just got up and walked out...RIGHT PAST 2 ladies standing talking in the front. With time limited, we had no time to stop and address how annoyed we were, so we walked right past them as if they weren't even there since we both felt that was the treatment we got. So disappointed. It's a beautiful restaurant. But  so disappointed in the service. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Not ever going back again.  A group of 14 of us on October 19th, and we called ahead.  So they knew to expect us.  No service at all.  Asked for drinks from bar and waited 20 min.  They brought food but not to all in timely fashion.  The server and wait staff (which were very few) did not seem to have any order.  The management, there is none.  Never going back."}
{"text":"I like Romano's a lot. Always have! It's a great corporate Italian place and family friendly. Food is always consistent and it's affordable. I hope they don't close the Henderson location. We love the server that sings at your table! She really makes this place fun."}
{"text":"Party of 10.   Made a reservation.    Had to wait 30 minutes anyway.   Desmond, our waiter could have cared less.   Food was decent, but the service was brutal.

Im guessing they either have high staff turnover or are under staffed."}
{"text":"While the food was good, the service today was crap.  There was a wait to be seated as tables had not been cleaned. So for most of our meal we we're surrounded by dirty tables. The food took about 40 minutes to arrive at the table which did not include the family style truffle Mac and Cheese that was ordered.  The waitress kept coming over to apologize for the service and said that the Mac and Cheese would be out shortly as the kitchen was backed up today and she sent over the manager as I canceled the mac and cheese order.  The Mac and Cheese was brought over and taken off of our bill as the manager stated that the order was not seen on the ticket.  I love this place and this is the first time that I've been really disappointed with their service."}
{"text":"Food was excellent; service was poor. 

I was there this evening with a medium sized group.  We were sat quickly and the first of us to arrive received our drinks promptly. 

Around 6pm, the rest of our group arrived, along with the dinner rush. This is where things started to go downhill. Our server took about 15 minutes to get our drinks to the table, then we had to flag her down to place our order. The rest of the evening went about the same -- we couldn't find our server when we needed her, it took forever to receive our food (I'm talking at least a half hour), etc. 

I don't think the slow service was *just* our server, though. It seemed like the whole staff was slow moving. It took a half hour for our food to arrive, but the food was piping hot when it did arrive, which means that it took the kitchen a half hour to turn around our ticket. Same with the bar beverages - everything arrived at the appropriate temp, so the bar must have been slow, too. 

We are here on vacation so it's unlikely that we would return. However, personally I would return, but ONLY at an off-peak time.

Also of note, we were there during a dinner \"rush\", but the place was NOT packed. Lots of tables were available, so it's not like the bar or the kitchen was slammed."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've gone here to eat.  The food is still alright.  I don't enjoy the changes that they've made to the rosemary bread.  The portions are not as big as I remember, but still delicious.

I had the Penne Rustica and my date had Mama's Plate (which was huge and according to him D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S).  I very highly recommend the Penne Rustica though don't get me wrong.

Our server on the other hand, Roxanna, was flying higher than a kite of Xanex or Lortab.  She was soo out of it, we almost wanted to ask her if she was selling."}
{"text":"I've been fan of the Macaroni Grill for years. I don't see them as often as I used to. My city never had one. The bread is amazing and I can certainly eat a loaf by myself. Love their drinks, food, friendly service and prices. I'll stop in when I'm in the area for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My dad and I went here after the car auction.. Our server seemed far more interested in upselling specials and wine, as opposed to listening to her customers.  Had the chicken cannelloni and penne rustica, and a couple of beers. The tapas were ok. 

If you want a great meal, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Should have looked at the reviews first, shame on me. Service was ok, only bright spot. Manhattan had too much bitters, side Caesar was palatable, veal chop was horrible, tough, soaking in a pan ( sorry excuse for a Marsala sauce) and the potatoes reeked of garlic and rosemary and anything else they found in the kitchen. This franchise is barely hanging on!"}
{"text":"Margarita prima, $14 combo x2 of pappadew peppers, crispy potato cakes, pasta Milano, grilled chicken spiedini  and an individual order of mushroom ravioli all of it for 3 people and no box for leftover. Forgot about the delicious bread and olive oil and crushed peppers. All of it gone in a matter of 2 hrs but in that 2 hrs the first 45 min was waiting for the orders to arrive. Restaurant was packed for a Thursday afternoon. Half off wine bottles were being ordered. Food was tasty, service efficient for a busy afternoon.  During a previous visit I remember trying Carmella's chicken which I think is better than pasta Milano. 
Would definitely visit. This is the north Olmsted location that I am reviewing. Will definitely strike one star for the crève coeur location in St. Louis."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place then they shut the place we went to I located the \"manager\" for the Sahara which I had spoke to them before they shut down said I would get a refund they that place shut down then I guess this manager moved location what a coincides that same manager is now the manager for a diff location tells me he cannot give a refund because that other location shut hmm I wonder why they shut down?
Oh and he said he was gonna send us a gift card well what do you no gift card. This place is shady especially the managers"}
{"text":"We went here last night for my son's birthday.  We have usually had good food here but not last night. I had eggplant Parmesan and it was dry and lacked taste. My husband had lobster ravioli and he bit down on a shell. Despite making a reservation and being told his birthday would be noted, I had to remind our server twice, once at the end of our meal when he offered our check without asking about dessert. Having the opera singer sing happy birthday with a dessert of his choice was a big reason we were there. Good for him we all ordered dessert which was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Chicken Parm.  was huge.  Great bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, yummy.  Wife had chicken fettuccine alfredo.  She was very happy with it. Good grilled chicken and the sauce was really fresh, clearly house made.  Good Caesar salads too.  Didn't have any wine.  Server advised that they have half price bottles of wine on Thursdays.  Might come back for that.  Kids liked there pasta and pizza too.  Pizza was really good sized.  Good fresh brewed iced tea too.  No complaints."}
{"text":"I've been to this macaroni grill over 10 years and it's just gotten worse after each subsequent visit. Our order was lost from the waitress to the kitchen. Our drink order was also forgotten. We arrived at 11:45 and didn't get our food until 1:20. It was not very busy although it was lunch time on a Sunday. It was my dads birthday and they did bring out a dessert on the house so that was nice. Thankfully our waitress was polite and the food was tasty but considering the amount of time it took-it could be our last visit. There were 9 of us so maybe a smaller group may have better luck."}
{"text":"We did a large group order for work, and I went to pick it up. When we opened up the food, I found that my order wasn't correct. I ordered the crunchy Lombardi salad with chicken, which was supposed to come with arugula, kale, Parmesan, red onion and apple. I got salad with artichoke, carrot, feta, and cucumber. I called to inform them that my order was mixed up, and returned to the restaurant. Once I arrived I showed the associate my order online, and what the salad should have contained. She seemed confused. They replaced my salad with another salad that only had some of the items the entree was supposed to have, with the exception  of chicken.. I got into my car and noticed the mistake, but felt embarrassed and frustrated. Instead of going back in and making a scene, I left, I  only had 10 minutes left of my lunch break and wanted to eat something. I'm very disappointed, very poor customer service. The second salad still wasn't the menu item I ordered and tasted poor. 

Overall very dissatisfied.. I will not be back."}
{"text":"We went there today for Mother's Day brunch. The service was terrible. We were seated  15 mins and were never approached by a server. I had to go ask the hostess if they were aware we were there.  She seemed surprised. After another 5 minute wait we were approached. Waitress took our drink orders. Wait wait 15 more minutes then drinks were delivered. We decided to order food then in case she never showed up again. Well another 30 mins of waiting only to be delivered COLD FOOD. my husband had his  delivered 10 mins after the rest of us (party of 4) but I must say his was nice and hot. Poor poor service. Doubt I'll go back there. They seemed very confused and disorganized."}
{"text":"This is not the best location of this chain in Las Vegas. So, fair warning. 

They have a lunch menu which is helpful to those of us who have short lunch breaks but need to get out of the office. I usually stick to just ordering the appetizers off of that menu. 

I would say that the way this place can improve is with their service. If service can get better, my rating will."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for a Fathers Day dinner for the family. It had been years since we had been there and my last experiences were positive. Unfortunately this night was not the case. We found dirty plates when we were seated, and service was a bit chaotic. My Cesar salad was great but my lasagna was barely warm and had to be sent back.  My Granddaughters step father's meal was sent back as his plate was disgustingly dirty.  The men's restroom had not been checked/cleaned for hours. The paper towels running over the sink area. Being the kind of person I am I gathered them up and shoved the excess down in to the bin. The entry area to the restrooms was also disgusting and trash was overflowing the small bin there. Now I understand people are basically \"Pigs\" but Darcy Spears would have had a field day here. We won't be back. I'd give the food 2.5 stars and the cleanliness.5 staff 4 stars as they were very apologetic."}
{"text":"I like Macaroni Grill. The table bread = delicious! I recommend ordering a little minced garlic and balsamic vinegar to mix in with the olive oil too. Mmmm! I think I can make a meal of their table bread alone.

I've tried a bunch of entrees here, and I haven't been let down yet. My favorite right now: the Parmesan Crusted Filet of Sole. But, like I mentioned, I haven't had anything bad yet. All good.

Oh yeah, they just started up a Happy Hour here. It's pretty good too. Really reasonable prices on draft beers (among other things) and delicious appetizers. The Macaroni & Cheese bites = ¡que rico!"}
{"text":"Great service if you sit in the bar area and Samantha is working in particular.  I do not know her personally, but she far exceeds a chain restaurant experience in terms of service.  She is prompt, super attentive, very friendly, and engaging.  The food is always stellar at this establishment.  I am always happy with my dishes and envious of my dining companion's plate!  The only areas for improvement would be the hostess is always too overloaded to be impressionable or they are not trained properly.  This seems to be a problem at many chain restaurants, the \"first face\" is neglected as it is seen the least but it is still a part of the experience.  The next is the management... they never go around to check on diners.  Fine... but if a diner goes out of their way to compliment your staff then give them your FULL attention by facing them bodily, giving great eye contact, a sincere smile (hey I am giving you awesome news), and by slightly leaning forward.  In all fairness the managers are probably overloaded too with some dumb promo for a 7 minute lunch or its free deal so I do not hold too much of a grudge on management in this example.  Rather corporate for such a silly promo as if they want to compete with McDonald's or be the next Fuzzoli's.   Decent dining takes a bit of time.  Do not rush it and overwork and stress the staff trying to be something you are not.  It was definitely the reason why the hostess was too busy to be good as she was stuck on a dumb call explaining said promo and likely why the management is so stressed."}
{"text":"Things were very good until dinner time hit around 6pm. Around 6pm they do not have enough stafff. A lady Tasia was working both the happy hour and the regular production floor. && mind you half the guests here are drinking the happy hour house wine . So why would we need experiential service. Not that we wouldn't want it. But to be realistic to handle just the happy hour customers. They are not experienced enough."}
{"text":"Fire Ray...rude rude rude....impatient, wrong food served..special occasion...wrong place"}
{"text":"Lamad was our server tonight and I must say he did amazing he gave the best suggestions on food  the Italian bake was the best penne rustica and drinks and also one of the most interactive happy  attitude a five star just for that thank u we will be back"}
{"text":"Things took a turn for the worse.

The evolving menu means that even the few veggie options like the mushroom ravioli even have meat broth in the sauce. The couscous that comes with the sole is flavorless compared to the old orso, and the other grilled fish dishes are just small.

I wanted to have a creaser salad with my meal at 6pm  but they were out of salad, and they were not even busy.

New menus and poor ordering by management mean I wont be back here too soon."}
{"text":"Well came with 4 people at lunch there is about 40 open tables and 10 tables being used...we stood in the front waiting to be seated for 15 minutes and then got our own menus, silverware, and sat ourselves and waited at the table for 15 more minutes until someone showed up.

We ordered salads and spaghetti at 12:20 its 1:00 pm still no food. 

The plus is that the manager came out and waived our food for it taking long and the whole experience, no-one ate their food because by the time we got it, it was very cold and they still put an ingredient I told several times I was allergic to on the food."}
{"text":"Don't even bother... This place used to be the go to place.  They have since went downhill.  They have changed the menu and taken there signature dish and most asked for pasta Milano off the menu.  Prices are also to high for what you get."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely terrible experience at this Macaroni Grill. 

I came here to celebrate my birthday with my family and boyfriend (keep in mind there were only four of us). Let it be known that Macaroni Grill was definitely far from my first of choices when it comes to a birthday meal/celebration, but the reason we decided to come here is because this is one of the only places that will liquify my grandmother's meals (due to physical/dietary restrictions she has, she MUST have her foods liquified). 

Anyhow, we were seated immediately and greeted by our server. There weren't a ton of tables in the restaurant, but then again there weren't a lot of servers there either. So it looked like he had his hands full. Drinks came out promptly. We ordered three appetizers: fried macaroni and cheese, a fondue dip, and fried zucchini chips. After about 45 minutes of waiting, they came out at different times. First the mac and cheese bites. There were five small 1\" or so cubes of macaroni that were served with an alfredo-like sauce. Granted, they tasted okay, but for around $9 for this specific appetizer, the quantity to price ratio was definitely an issue for me. They were polished off by our table before our next appetizer even arrived. Ten minutes later, the fondue arrived. I personally didn't like it, but everyone else said it was okay. Essentially it was just melted parmesan and mozzarella. Another app that wasn't worth the high price tag. The best of the appetizers, the fried zucchini, came out about another 10 minutes later. There weren't a lot of pieces to the entree and they lacked a certain \"wow\" factor, so as I'm sure you can all guess, we weren't too impressed with the first course. 

For our entrees, my grandmother ordered the liquefied chicken alfredo (keep in mind she gave specific liquefication instructions that have been followed at this restaurant before), I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, my mother ordered the lasagna, and my boyfriend ordered cheese ravioli with alfredo sauce. They came out all at different times. Like with three minute intervals in between the arrival of each entree. Given that there were four of us, that was a considerably disappointing amount of time for food to come out after the appetizers (enough tim to go through four loaves of bread with olive oil). And, let's not forget to mention that every single one of our meals was cold. Not warm. But cold. My boyfriend's cheese ravioli were still frozen on the outside. My mother's lasagna was lukewarm at best, and my spaghetti and meatballs were cold as well. My grandmother's dish was the worst disappointment of them all as it was prepared incorrectly and was served at what seemed like a refrigerated temperature. 

We notified our server of the problem and he did his best to take the meals back and have the kitchen re-prepare them. When they came back there was legitimately no improvement with any of them. We flagged down a manager and spoke with him about what had happened, and he said that he would take care of us, like any manager would. We then saw him go to our server and verbally accuse him of the entire situation being his fault. Uhm. No, homie. If anything, you should be speaking with your back of house staff. And behind closed doors, because it is unacceptable to belittle an employee in front of guests. 
 
Instead of having our food sent back to the kitchen a third time, we left two entrees and boxed the other two to take home without even eating them. The check then arrived, and the manager took off $8 from the check. The discount that was entered was a \"referral comp\" which didn't even account for the cost of one of the appetizers. This was the biggest disappointment, as it was obvious that he didn't want the GM to see how badly the dinner service was by comping the items that were truly messed up. 

Most definitely not impressed with this trip and I have to say I will not be back. The quality of the food and the service at this place has gone downhill really quickly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a huge surprise, and a good one, too!  Here's why:

For a chain, the menu is surprisingly upscale!  Lots of different choices, new and trendy flavor combinations, and different serving sizes available on some items.  The food is fresh and appears to be prepared with care and dare i say it, a sense of pride!

My latest visit here I found myself ordering the Parmesan Crusted Sole.  This is seriously one of the BEST dishes I've ever had in a restaurant.  Let me qualify that by pointing out that I've dined at some pretty special places both locally and across the country.  Seriously, one of the best meals I've had, period.  The fish was perfectly cooked, the lemon butter sauce was silky and perfectly balanced, and the side dish.. oh man!  It was Orzo with radicchio, spinach and sundried tomatoes.  This along with the delicious bread was perfect.

Before I left I glanced at the menu again, and even though I was stuffed, I found my mouth watering over things like Oven Fried Feta, Shrimp and Avocado Brushetta, and some amazing sounding pasta dishes.

This chain has changed a lot over the years.  Their food is much more modern and inventive than what you see at most Italian themed places.  There seems to be a broader influence to the menu.

As for service, I simply could not have asked for better service.  Polite, attentive, friendly and helpful with the menu.  This is a place I suggest you don't pass up!"}
{"text":"This place seems a bit more upscale than the Olive Garden. The food was okay -- I'm not a fan of rosemary and that's an ingredient in their bread -- so I missed out on those carbs.

Service was great. 

Kind of annoying is the paper they use over the tablecloths. It's supposed to be \"creative\" and they have crayons on the table even if you don't have kids with you but it was annoying because it kept crinkling and seemed more in the way. Feels like a cheap way for them not to  have to change out the tablecloths after each guest.

Meh. May return, may not. It's a chain..."}
{"text":"Terrible rude lazy staff. Unorganized management. Everything about this place screams SHUT DOWN THE DOORS. I would rather eat at the little mexican stand they set up in parking lots than go back there. Go to the location on Sahara... or basically any of the others."}
{"text":"Absolute GARBAGE! The service sucks, the food wouldn't interest you dog, and the place is a mess. I won't be back"}
{"text":"FML!!!  This must have been my punishment for a wrong i've commited in the past.  I ate at the Macaroni Grill yesterday evening against the better judgement of my stomache.  We were sat quickly and is the case with any chain restaurant nothing was too catchy about the decor, consistancy made for the masses.   We ordered our food and it  was nothing less then what can only be described as a step above a poo sandwhich.  The pasta was over cooked, meatballs had little or no flavor to distiguish it from ground beef.  Even downing  2 glasses of wine did nothing to wash the bland taste out of my mouth.  

I'm giving this 2 stars.  1 for the service.  The server was on her game, friendly but would probably do better to work at a restraunt with better food.  The other star is for the desserts,  our lemon cake was moist and sherbert was cool and tasty.  

My advice: Sacrifice the convenience of a chain and find a place worth the money.  For what we spent vs what we recieved, we came out the loser."}
{"text":"My wife and I were there last Sunday for an early dinner. On arrivial, there were maybe six dinner parties at the tables. Food is average at best, and service is below average at best! We had to ask for several things throughout the meal....The waitress acted like she was doing you a favor by providing anything! If you go, just make sure you don't get \"Becky\" as your server!"}
{"text":"Picking up some items for the plant today and ended up across the parking lot from Romano's Macaroni Grill. We've dined at the one in University City on many occasions and are fan in general but have never dined at this location.

We got there around 2:30 any lunch had already dissipated. The hostess promptly seated us and our waiter was there at our table in quick order. Introduced himself and wrote his name in crayon on the white butcher paper that covers the table. Nice touch and common to Romano's.

He gave us menu's and took our drink order. I ordered Sweeten Tea but first asked how sweet the tea actually was. He quickly went and got me a sample to try which then prompted me to order half sweet and half unsweetened to get to the proper level of sweetness.

He then proceeded to get our drinks while we studied the menu. Menu has been ungraded since the last time we dined at a Romano's with more of a lighter fare.

My wife order the Chicken Scaloppini while I order the Pork Chop in a Fig Marsala reduction along with a Caesar Salad to start.

He placed the order with the kitchen and brought us some bread and made a dipping sauce at the table. Bread was nice and hot but would have been nice if a bread knife had been provided. The knives in the table setting are not designed to cut the loaf and the loaf is coated with hot butter so very messy to pick it up and break it with one's own hands.

All in all , the bread was excellent with great taste and texture.

The Caesar on the other hand was a disappointment. Very dry and bland in both taste and texture. High point on the salad was the croutons if that says anything.

The entrees however both proved to be excellent. My wife enjoyed he Chicken and the angel hair pasta that came with it. She's had the flu for a week and this was her first time out of the house so she really appreciated the good food.

The Pork Chop was nice and thick, moist and not the least bit dry with great taste and texture. The new potatoes, zucchini, onion and other vegetable made for a nice balance.

All in all, a nice dining experience. Restaurant is nice, airy and open with a Tuscan flair. Service was very good and with the exceptions noted above, the cuisine was excellent.

We would definately go again next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"This is a decent, but obviously mass-produced Italian place serving decent but fairly mediocre pasta and other Italian-style dishes and both the place and food reveal the chain nature of the establishment.  The food is enjoyable enough, but fairly crude, salty, and utterly lacking in the finesse and character of truly good Italian food, with an obvious mass-produced mediocrity of either meat or tomato sauces or the other, overly creamy, sauces.  The bread is annoyingly herbal, a crude, mass-produced, cheap attempt at providing \"fancy\" or so-called \"artisan\" breads when the herbs just cover up the fact that the bread is mediocre, getting in the way of enjoying bread with oil and vinegar.  The pasta generally has too much meat, not enough sauce, and a ridiculously small amount of actual pasta, problems that were particularly obvious with the spaghetti and meatballs. 

 It is overall fairly similar to Olive Garden in food and décor.  It also has that ubiquitous and obviously fake feel in service, food, atmosphere, and the like - transparent ersatz \"local Italian trattoria\" atmosphere and obviously generic, mass-produced stereotyped \"Italian culture.\"  The \"Italian lessons\" being blurted out in the restroom, for example, highlight the annoyingly hokey insincerity of the places \"Italian\" credentials, but the whole thing is perfect for a city like Las Vegas.  It's decent enough and I would eat here, but I'd never choose to go here on my own.  The main plus is the bottle of cheap, but very decent, enjoyable, food-friendly red wine on the table, although again that is an annoyingly ersatz-Italian trattoria quality, a not entirely successful attempt to replicate the jugs of red wine one may get in Italy."}
{"text":"I went here to meet a client for lunch recently. The service was quick and the food was okay, but I think it's a bit pricey for what you get. I got a half sandwich and a cup of soup with an ice tea and by bill was $16 out the door with tax and tip. At similar Italian restaurants you can get an entire sandwich and a bowl of soup with a drink plus tax and tip for about $3-4 less. It's not drastic; just comparing apples to apples."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful! My mother in law had the shrimp scampi which is beautiful and delicious-- our sever Sara gave us great recommendations was super attentive.  Dan the manager came over and checked on us-- and the tiramisu is the best in town!!! We haven't been here in a while because of our schedules but we can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Horrible food experience- steak had to be redone 3 times, Everything else was flavorless and subpar from past MG experiences."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant several times and we have enjoyed the food and experience. It's always clean, quick seating, food is good. I don't know why it scored so low?"}
{"text":"We have been going there Macaroni Grill for years. We recently went to this location to celebrate a birthday with a party of 9. We had perfect service and food. Our waiter Stephen sang Happy Birthday in an Italian it was beautiful! Thank you for another memorable celebration and wonderful experience. We have also had two Thanksgiving dinners in a row at other locations perfect both times!"}
{"text":"My fiance & I called ahead on prom night. The service was a bit slow, but I'm sure it was due to the rush that came right before us. I was most impressed with the manager from the moment I walked it. She greeted us with a smile & was all for helping her associates. After being seated I asked our waiter what the managers name was because I was just so impressed with her customer service.  I love seeing hands on managers & she was a great demonstration of this tonight. In the chaos of prom problems arose & uneven heard her say to a customer \"that was my fault I will be right back\". I repeatedly said throughout dinner that I just loved her attitude and energy that she brought to this restaurant that I just had to let her know that her work doesn't go unnoticed, but I'm sure others have experienced Gina's energy & we will be back because of her."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I've sat in both the restaurant and the bar.  The entrees are mediocre, and the apps are either phenomenal or mediocre.  I'm a big fan of making dinner out of apps so that I can try more things, so the apps are what makes or breaks a place for me.  The bartender Nico is friendly enough and makes up for the hit or miss food.  If this place were a little more affordable I would get happy here more often but there are places with better food, drinks, and prices."}
{"text":"I love it here. Maybe I am the odd one out, whatever.

But if I had to chose corporate goodness, I'd come here. I get to draw on the table, eat tasty bread and customize my pasta.

I order the same thing every time so I know what it is supposed to taste like. It has never turned me down."}
{"text":"As previously stated, curse of the Chain.  In a chance to meet up with another couple, we entered the Macroni Grill.  We had a forty minute wait at 7PM.  Which any idiot willing to go near a mall on a weekend night shound be subjected to on pronciple alone.  I like half of the people decide an over priced, under alcoholed drink could help bide my time.  Well, there was the impression twelve tables were not being seated.  Stunned that someone else had spoke a suspicion I long held \"they just want you to wait so you think this is a really good place\"  We waited only thirty minutes, and were placed next to kitchen.  Three of us opted for the well advertised Chianti BBQ Steak.  Well the medium was rare, one medium rare was medium well, and one was rare.  The procuitto mac n cheese was very dry, like overbaked and needs some milk/cream/butter dry.  The side were grilled vegetables, the three of us shared one tomato, half zuchini, and piece of eggplant.  The smart person ordered the Salmon and had best food at table.  We have had a slightly better experience on our last visit, but just enough to meet someone here (2 for $20 was reason last time)"}
{"text":"If you have ever been to a Romano's prior, there's nothing different about this one.  Pretty much the same layout (except for the fact that the hostess stand looks a bit more open), same food (with a few new selections), and good service.

Pros:
*  Calamari (I think I can speak for my gf & say that Romano's Calamari is bomb)!
*  Bread (gotta get that bread and don't forget the oil with fresh ground pepper..yum)!
*  good service
*  the ambiance feels upscale (the butcher paper on your table will take you back to reality though). 

Cons:
*  Its seems that the portions have gotten smaller (presentation has changed too).
*  It took a little longer than normal to get our bill.

Overall:  
This is some good food and decently priced too.  I can't come to this place without ordering Calamari and filling up on some of that bread!  Romano's never disappoints.  The one thing that I noticed has changed though is that the server does not write his name on the butcher paper like they used to (they used to introduce themselves and write their name upside (to face the guests) with a crayon).  They also do not bring a bottle of house wine upon arriving to your table with fresh bread like they used to.

Tips:
*  Like them on Facebook & get $5.00 off an entree.  You do not need to print it, just show them on your phone and make sure to give them the coupon code #.
*   As if I haven't hyped it up enough.. Try the Calamari!
*  I didn't order it this time, but the Bellini here is good too!
*  Romano's encourages drawing on the butcher paper so if you want to have a nice dinner with the family and you have kids that have a short attention span, this place can deliver."}
{"text":"Just to clarify, that's MINUS (-) one stars!

I went there with my travel companion, last evening, hoping to make it simple after a long day on the road. It was a disaster. The server, Satchel, was sweet, but could not properly speak. That is, he slurred his words terribly. He also kept on making lots of excuses when our food was not ready, some 45 minutes after we had ordered. We both ordered the \"Steak and Salad.\" Simple enough, right?

My partner ordered a simple Manhattan from the bar. We had to keep on asking when that would appear. Finally, the order of gluten free fettucine with pesto arrived, and we split that. We had to keep begging the manager, Satchel and other servers to bring our dual \"Steak and Salad\" orders. Finally, when they did arrive, my steak was not cooked as I had wished. That's when I blew my cool. I left, as the manager was comping the meal, save but for the alcohol.

Please read the other reviews on this location should you think that I am being unfair or exaggerating. Most of the other reviews will support my experience.

Don't waste your time or cash here. There are MANY other choices if you're looking for fake Italian food. To be fair, the fettuccine with pesto sauce was plentiful and delicious. However, the negatives far outweigh the positives in this restaurant.

Also, there is no Wi-Fi to kill time while one waits endlessly for one's food."}
{"text":"This review is for the lunch express. The gimmick is $7 lunches in less than 7 minutes or it's free. My friend got his food in time but mine took about 20 minutes.  Food was ok for $7. No one said anything about my food taking too long. Would feel like a jerk asking for $7 back anyway."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and always find the food fresh and tasty. The bread couldn't be fresher right out of the oven. I really like the serving sizes that always fill me up."}
{"text":"A classic chain just got even better.  This is our new go-to spot when we are in the mood for some Italian food during lunch.  Why is that you ask, well because they make it soooo convenient.  Romano's now has an Express Menu where your order comes out within 7 minutes of ordering.  Totally affordable, filling, and excellent quality.  Don't forget to get some of that Rosemary bread ($1 extra for a loaf)!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late dinner. Service was great Guy took great care of us and was very attentive. We never once had to ask for refills or bread. Food was delicious. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"So disappointed! First grandma lunch with Colton. Slow service, forgot the chicken in my chicken pasta lunch, and coltons came 7 minutes after ours. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday night for dinner. Expected a wait for a table...no big deal 20 minutes.

We got their Italian Nachos appetizer. It was good, sat under heat lamp too long...we sat by the kitchen and watched the food sit in the pass for too long.

My dinner was okay, have had better. My boyfriend only ate a few bites of his carbonara. No flavor, noodles had no sauce to see and egg just made them all sticky without the proper sauce to noodle ratio.

Our server didn't even ask if there was something wrong when she took his uneaten plate away.

I will not be eating here ever again. Too bad it is close to my house."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to a Macaroni's Grille in years, and I'd thought our palates had outgrown this place.  But we had a gift card for quite a while and decided to use it.  

What a pleasant surprise!  I had the Stuffed Mushrooms as an appetizer.  They could have been jucier, but were good enough, especially the mushrooms themselves.  We went through two loafs of their bread.  More places seem to be going with more eclectic bread, so I'm glad they have stuck with theirs as it very good, the best of the chains certainly.  

For entrees I had Penne Rustica, the wife Parmesan-Crusted Sole.  I tasted hers, and it was very good, and she was very happy with it.  My Penne Rustica was great.  The chicken and shrimp in it are good, but what elevates this is how wonderful the sauce is, along with the pasta being quite good.  The portion was large such that I only ate half, and the next day it warmed up well.  

I was quite surprised at how good this was and felt a bit snooty at the preconceptions I came in with.  This is far superior to anything at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Horrible experience  Let me first say they only had 5 tables filled in the restaurant all with 4 or less guests...so it was not busy at all.

Bathrooms were Filthy. I personally like to wash my hands before I eat but don't know how staff can wash their hands as required by law since I had to come out with my dripping as the paper towel holder didn't work.

We were told they do not have Hot Tea, they only serve Ice Tea,  this seems crazy since they have a dessert menu with coffee on it.

If you order Sweet Tea be ready to pay .50 cents extra as this is considered Flavored Tea just like if you ordered blackberry, pomegranate, peach, blood orange or raspberry found this crazy.

Waiter offered to get us balsamic vinegar and then I saw him walking around the restaurant and then he approached the table behind us and asked them if they were finished with it because we wanted to use it and they only have one bottle in the restaurant.  Again this is crazy 

Bruschetta appetizer was brought to the table and looked okay but when we picked up the bread it was totally burnt on the side that was facing down to the plate so this was really bad.

Entrees took 30 minutes to be served to us and when they came they were ice cold...Guess it was laying on the counter while everyone was so busy doing nothing.  The waiter offered to heat our entrees up in the microwave oven to which we said no and then he just left the table.
I had to get up from the table and go over and ask the waiter for grated Parmesan cheese and he then asked the hostess to get it for us.  She brought it to us about 5 minutes later but even Parmesan could not make my cold Chicken and Pasta dish with the wilted (old) greens edible and my husband was not able to eat the shrimp scampi since it was so cold and bland.  

There was NO Service Recovery, NO management on the floor but there was plenty of running and hiding.   

The bill was over $50.00 for nothing as it was all inedible with the exception of the Sweet Tea or should I call it the Sugar flavored Tea.

Waiting for a return call from Corporate."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because we dined @ this location about an hour before closing?

I've only eaten at one other Mac Grill, and that was back on the east coast.  The one in Harrisburg, PA (new location) rocks with outstanding service, fresh foods, and a clean/inviting atmosphere.

The location on Sahara in Vegas, has much to live up to!  Our server was a little on the untactful side.  He offered NO spices/herbs for the olive oil for our bread.  Those spices/herbs make a BIG difference!

I ordered a side salad before my meal.  The lettuce was old and wilted.  Our server did NOT offer any fresh grated pepper or cheese.

I ordered the Chicken Marsala and was now offered fresh grated cheese but no pepper.  My meal was good but maybe a little overdone.

My boyfriend ordered the Mama's Trio.  His lasagna was clearly burnt and DRY!!!!  It looked like lasagna you get from a buffet.  I can't remember how the other two parts of his meal were but, clearly remember the less than desirable lasagna.

Overall, the service (at this location) was adequate but not great to any extreme.  The employees all seemed to be either grouchy or in their own worlds.  Like I mentioned before, the service we've received at OTHER Mac Grills has been excellent and the employees all seemed to make you feel welcome.

The restaurant was clean and comfortable.  

My experience at this location has kept me from revisiting any Mac Grill.  I love the food but am afraid to be disappointed again.  Kudos goes to the Harrisburg, PA Mac Grill for great food and great service!"}
{"text":"How you gonna call it Macaroni Grill and there isn't any macaroni on the menu, WTF?!? I mean the had deep fried macaroni bites but no macaroni & cheese entrees?!? Seriously?!? Very limited on the vegetarian choices too. The service wasn't bad, wasn't superb either. The only good thing is the two of us got full for $40."}
{"text":"Staggeringly bad.  I am(was) a big fan of Macaroni Grill.  I used to go to the one in Sacramento California and always had a 4 or 5 star experience.  When I moved here, I was pleased that Macaroni Grill had restaurants here as well.  Silly me.  

I went with my family a few years ago and although the place looked like other Macaroni grills, the food was unimpressive.  It seemed like it had been cooked earlier and was merely warmed over.  The wait staff was fair, but they could not make up for the surprisingly bland food.

Needless to say, after about 3 years, I had the chance to go back, this time for a farewell party for a co-worker.  We had called well in advance and to their credit, they were able to seat us fairly quickly.  Unfortunatly, this was the high point.

Our primary server, perhaps since he would get the 'predetermined tip' due to our party's size, appeared bored by the experience.  He would get very swarmy and pseudo friendly for about 15 seconds, then revert back to the bored personalty.  Very bizarre and something i've never seen in a restaurant before.  I'm used to the Macaroni grill wait staff being friendly, helpful, and a bit fun.

After a very long wait for our food, we began to eat.  Out of our party of 12, half found that the food was cold.  Some sent their food back only to have it come back the same, merely microwaved.  One dish was oversalted.  I was skeptical, so i tried a bite, and I could barely get it down.  And I like salt!

It was quickly becoming unpleasant.  Our conversation veered from our memories of our co-worker's time working with us to one focused on how we would never again bring a corporate function to the Mac Grill. At least not the one in Mesa.  Our waiter clearly seemed to have something else to do or wanted to leave work.  Quite unprofessional and very shocking.  

We paid up, most of us eating less than half and refusing doggy bags.  Finally, to top it off, I inquired about this with macaroni Grill corporate.  They asked for information which i then provided.  Haven't heard a thing since.  It's been about a year.

So, in short, fellow Yelpers, out of the many restaurants i've been to in the area, a few have been awesome, many quite satisfactory, a few \"thanks but we won't be back\", and one \"are you kidding me\"?  Congrats Macaroni Grill of Mesa."}
{"text":"Went to lunch last week with my boyfriend.  The place was not busy so we were shown to a table quickly.  We ordered and before our food arrived, my attorney called and said he was in the area and he needed me to sign  some papers and could he meet me at the restaurant.  I said yes and told our waiter, Tony, there would be 2 gentlemen coming but would not be eating as they were only going to be there for a few minutes.  We got our food when the attorney was there.  I was listening to him and was not eating my meal.  Here is my issue, Tony, the waiter kept coming to the table, asking if I was going to eat, was everything ok, did I want a box, to the point he got alittle annoying.  When I told him, everything was good, he said, well, no problem, after all I am here until 5:00 as he walked away.  Now mind you, there were only 4-5 tables with people, it was not busy but Tony felt like he should rush me.  My Attorney turned around and said, I wouldn't give you a very nice tip for that remark.  My Attorney was probably there for 15 minutes but Tony wanted me to hurry and eat so he could get rid of us.  Well, sorry Macaroni Grill, I decided to tell Tony to bring me a box so I could leave.  Your food was awesome but I don't like being rushed especially when you are not full.  Had you been full, I would understand, but really, we were there for only 56 minutes. We did not order the 7 or 9 minutes specials, we ordered from the menu. The 2 stars are because of the arrogance of Tony the waiter."}
{"text":"BOMB.

I came here for the first time with my boyfriend. He used to work here so it wasn't new to him.

We were quickly seated and given complimentary bread, which was very flavorful. Then we got in our mango and peach ice tea orders. Those came right away and it was so refreshing and perfectly sweetened. 

We ordered calamari for our appetizer. I love it so much! Perfectly breaded, not too salty, and the marinara was amazing!

We decided to share a plate of pasta since we usually never finish our food if we get our own plates at an Italian restaurant. We did the \"create your own pasta.\" Spaghetti noodles, marinara sauce mixed with alfredo sauce, chicken, mushrooms, spinach, and broccoli. Hella good! I kinda wish I had leftovers now...

The ambiance was nice with the music and dimly lit setting. I liked that you could draw on the table. It gave us some pretty good laughs. 

All in all, definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"We waited for almost 10 minutes to get a glass of water, than another 20 minutes to not be waited on, we watched him greet two tables, give them bread, AND take their order, we had to ask another server where he went. He can back and didn't even seem like he wanted to wait on us, he was very cold and 10 minutes later we still don't have our appetizer. Horrible service !"}
{"text":"Do not order the pizza. While it looked like it was baked right it was not. It was like eating raw dough and also a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Mom picked this place to celebrate her 83rd birthday! I was pleasantly surprised the food was decent, chicken parm of course it was an oversized portion but damn did it taste good! The huge bottles of wine might have helped in this review, we even took the wine home. hahahaha!"}
{"text":"Food: Edible. Not great. I got the Pasta Sampler and it seemed like it spent a little to long under a heat lamp. The prosciutto mac n cheese was the highlight. The rest not so great. My wife got the chicken parmesan. She thought it was alright.  Kind of expensive for what you get also.  

Ambiance: Pretty cool. My daughter had a great time drawing on the \"tablecloth\". 

Service: Excellent. Casey (KC?) was great. He was the only thing that saved this place from 2 stars. 

Overall it wasn't bad enough to not go back but not good enough to make the regular rotation."}
{"text":"My girl friend and I ate here for lunch one day and sat in the bar area, at a booth. They took over 10 minutes to bring our drinks and then this bartender named Jonathon came over to take our orders. Jonathon was SO ANNOYING. He kept cracking jokes and offering appetizers, side salads, desserts... things we just weren't interested in ordering. He recommended a dish for me, I ended up not liking it and when he asked I told him I didn't care much for it, and he just shrugged and walked away. He seemed to ignore us for the rest of the meal. It was awkward and I won't go back simply bc I don't ever want to have Jonathon as my server."}
{"text":"COCKAROACHES!!!!! Don't go here if you don't want to eat with COCKAROACHES at your table. I've been here twice on two different occasions... After the first time I saw a cockaroach, I stopped coming here to this location for more than a year. Mom wanted to check it out again, so we went two weeks ago. There were two COCKAROACHES on the table with us!!! I was horrified. I tried killing them with a plate so mom wouldn't notice but she did. Unfortunately we were all done eating our dinners and there was nothing we could do. The server was nice enough, although he could have brought us refills without us asking as you could see our glasses were almost empty. Very grossed out about COCKAROACHES I hope everyone avoids this place. If it's this gross on the dining tables WHO KNOWS how many bugs are in the kitchen.... I don't want to know."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Macaroni Grill in years, since most of the locations around me had shut down. I was on business in the area, and decided to give it a go with a couple of associates. 

The restaurant itself looked exactly like I remembered; kind of old world Italian vibe with a little rustic, industrial thrown in for good measure. Not as formal or touristy looking as Olive Garden, but in the same ballpark. 

We were seated immediately, and the waitress was friendly. She seemed very confused about what was on draft when we inquired. I got the lowdown, which wasn't all that impressive. They were certainly very concerned with selling us on their wine special, and prix fixe menu.

The bread was pretty good, but the waitress put way too much cracked pepper in the olive oil. It was a sea of black pepper and a few sprinkles of olive oil. The pace of the dinner was good, although the second round of drinks was slow. 

My food was OK with pasta that was a little too rubbery in texture. The \"stuffed\" portion of the pasta was a little cold, as if they'd been frozen and reheated. 

There are probably lots of better Italian restaurants in the area that are better."}
{"text":"We recently ate at Romano's Macaroni Grill and it was really good food. We've eaten at this location a few times and have NEVER been disappointed. They are a scratch kitchen so they can alter how a dish is made. Everything is fresh, from the bread given to you at the start to the dessert. It is a bit pricey, but to me it's worth it to get authentic Italian food! The staff is always friendly, attentive and quick. No sooner did we order the appetizer was it on our table within 5 minutes. We ate there on a Friday night, close to 6pm. We didn't have to wait for a table. If you want an authentic Italian meal with great service, I recommend checking this restaurant out."}
{"text":"Yet again another atrocious experience at macaroni grill...first of all we were sat in the back room where the thermostat was set to a frigid 65 degrees. I'm normally a hot natured person but today I was so cold I had to put my arms inside my shirt for half of the experience so I didn't feel like I was freezing to death. One of the many sloppy dressed waiters wearing jeans asked if we wanted bread and it took us three times of asking again to actually get it. I asked for my salad dressing on the side and of course it wasn't, there was so much dressing I couldn't even taste my salad and it was sopping wet but I was literally too hungry at this point to have them make another. Overall very disappointed. Hard to say which was worse the service or the food."}
{"text":"I was really hoping this place was going to be better than it was because the location is nice as well as the atmosphere but the only reason it gets 2 stars is for the loaded fries on the appetizer list. First, it's FREEZING outside so I want to come inside where it's warm but I spent the entire meal shivering because it's SO cold in here and I have no idea why. Which is okay maybe if it's June but it's January so no. Second, I apparently had to order two appetizers because the one I wanted was on the pick two for 9.49 even though there was a price under the fries that said 5.49 and I just wanted fries but my server said that I had to because they were the same price whether I got two appetizers (9.49) or one (5.49). I'm bad at math but 5.49 and 9.49 are not the same thing but whatever, my husband got a second appetizer. Freezing now but with two appetizers, not ideal but whatever bring me my food please. I ordered the folded ravioli and it comes out in this cast iron skillet thing and I'm really excited because it looks SO warm and I just want to curl up in it because again, it's cold, I'm cold and hey! so is my ravioli...... yay. 

Now I'm cold with two appetizers and some cold raviolis."}
{"text":"BEWARE! MACARONI GRILL IS NOW CHARGING UP TO $5.49 FOR SOUP AND/OR SALAD! When we got there, I saw on the menu that it was now an added charge of $2.49. We both decided to get the lobster bisque, which turned out to be terrible, so we exchanged it for a side salad. Everything was good. The server was Daunua & she was very attentive. Our food came out within 2 minutes of us getting the salads. It all went wrong when we got the bill.

Daunua had charged us $3.49 for the salads, even though the menu clearly said $2.49. When asked about it, she said she was going to charge us $5.49 for the soup but that she was giving us a break. I told her the menu stated $2.49 & she said that didn't include the soup. She was wrong, as I checked the menu later. 

I was disappointed that she didn't know her own menu & when asked, she made stuff up. We were in a hurry & I was angry, so we left without getting a refund of our $2.00. I'm not angry about the $2.00, it's more that how the server handled it rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how good our meal was. It was Thursday so bottled wine was half price and you get to take home the unfinished bottle. Everything was so good, from the bread with evoo and balsamic to dip it in, to the luscious lemon dessert. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Normally I'm a fan of MG.  I think this time it was just an off item on the menu.  We went here for lunch and despite this location being right in the middle of an otherwise bustling business area, it was dead.  We didn't mind the lack of a wait and were greeted and seated immediately.  Our server was pleasant and attentive and gave us ample time to look over the menu.  
We opted for the lunch special cause really, you can't beat a $9.99 lunch at a sit down restaurant.  It starts with a caesar salad that was a bit lackluster but the flavor was decent - so far, so ok.  They also give you a breaded mozarella triangle that was the highlight of the meal.  It's about a credit card sized piece of scrumptuous mozarella lightly breaded, fried and then served on a plate of delicious marinara sauce.  I wish I had ordered 2 more of those and then called it a lunch.  But alas, my entree arrived.  I went with the gorgonzola alfredo and it was just...um, ok.  The pasta was cooked al dente but the sauce wasn't what I was hoping for.  It was topped with approximately 3 extremely small pieces of pancetta that I almost needed a magnifying glass to find.  My husband did the same lunch special but went with the marinara penne with italian sausage.  His pasta was undercooked - not just al dente - like it had an obvious bite to it and should have stayed in the water for a few more minutes.  He was as underwhelmed as I was.  
I guess I shouldn't complain for $20.  I mean - the rosemary bread and fried mozarella were worth that alone.  I guess next time I'll stick to something more tried and true.  Penne rustica, anyone?  Mmmmmmmm..."}
{"text":"I had never been to this restaurant so I decided to give it a try. The food is good & the staff is friendly. I had the Bellini cocktail which is delicious and so is the Tiramisu Expresso martini as well although it was a little strong. I'll definitely be coming back for those and the crispy fried mozzarella with marinara sauce."}
{"text":"Came in around 4:50 pm and the place was empty but was starting to fill up just as I was leaving. Decor and ambiance is always nice and pretty; sometimes you just need a quiet place to have dinner. The food, at least the food I got tonight, is not the quality I've usually gotten. Bread for the table came without a bread knife so I was forced to saw through it with the knife rolled up in my napkin which is not made for that job. Salads, one ranch and one with a vinaigrette for my companion, were fine, but the vinaigrette was so weighed down by pepper that it was quite needlessly spicy. Entrees were the Pollo Caprese and the Pasta De Mare. Pollo Caprese consisted of a whole 'grilled' chicken breast (no real char or grilled flavor whatsoever), capellini pomodoro (spaghetti covered in a spicy red sauce with halved cherry tomatoes in it, but outside of a mild spiciness there was no flavor at all, the pasta itself was bland as it comes), and some arugula covered in a very sour vinaigrette. 

Pasta De Mare is supposed to come with mussels, shrimp, and scallops on top of fettuccine and more pomodoro sauce but we asked for alfredo sauce instead. Sauce was way too thick and for the price of the dish ($18.50) I expected more on top of it. To be fair there was more than enough mussels put in, but there were only two little scallops and three little shrimps on it. My companion loves mussels so that was fine with her. 

Service was just fine. Our waitress was pleasant and prompt. We were mostly just disappointed about the food but it wasn't terrible (nowhere near it enough to lodge a complaint). Unfortunately it was bland enough for us to not be back for a while, but by no means would I not believe the cooks were just having an off night."}
{"text":"Ok...I know that it's a chain restaurant, however, there are great ones..this is not one of them.  This place is terrible.  My husband, father and I went there for dinner last night because we had shopping to do in the area.  It was so bland and overpriced. Our server must have been new, at least I hope she has some kind of  an excuse.  My father got his dinner first, then I got mine, then about 5-10 minutes later my husband got his.  Since we are not rude people, we wait until everyone has there food before we start to eat.  No apologies, no excuses, none what so ever for the timing. 
So, I usually like to make my comments short....don't go....terrible food, worse service,"}
{"text":"Basic Italian fare in a chain-style atmosphere. The service is excellent and you can draw on the tables. Nice food presentation, you can dine here without breaking the budget. Excellent desserts."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst lunch I've had. I was being treated to lunch by my 20 year old grandson. We both ordered from the 7$ in 7 minutes menu. My meal was delivered in a timely manner but my grandsons? First order was burned so by the time his meal arrived mine was cold & tasteless. Neither one of us were able to finish our lunch, one very late meal was taken off the bill but free for both would have been too much. I doubt I will ever return to this location. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible service/management .  I placed an online order at 4pm and was told it would be ready at 04:25.  I arrived at the designated time and the place was empty. Thought great my food should be ready. I then watched as they started to cook my meal and I had to wait a further 20 minutes because management missed my order.  If they had owned up the mistake and apologized I could have accepted it, but to be constantly told a few more minutes was an out right lie when they knew full well they hadn't started it.  I had my wife and baby in the car waiting which made matters worse....."}
{"text":"I had a  2 for 1 $9.00 express dinner coupon so we order up 2 dinners to go. The deal was 9 min or its free, it took 20, but since I was getting 2 meals for $9.00 I did not make a fuss. 

 The actual pasta was fine and amount was fair but it  had maybe a 1/4 of a chicken breast. The chicken tasted like it came from Taco Bell, VERY processed. The sauce straight from a can.

 I have had much better frozen dinners. My husband and I used to like Macaroni Grill it sad too see its food go so down hill."}
{"text":"My first time to get the express lunch for $7.  I was impressed. The lady who took my order was fast and professional and even gave me a ciabatta  bread. So I came in ordered, watch my order made (they were busy today) then I was off to work across the street. Taste test time. It was sooooo good. I was worried because of the bad reviews I read before coming but I chose this place over the next door chick fil a that's so overrated."}
{"text":"I only frequent this place once a year, its where I went on my first date with my boyfriend 2 years ago-- So its a special place for us.
I enjoy the service, very warm and friendly. We were offered a complimentary dessert in honor of our anniversary, but we were too stuffed from dinner to need any dessert. 
This is a good place for families and groups. I like the open kitchen plan. There is also take out option and a bar to quench your thirst if you so chose. Many items on the menu to chose from depending on what you are craving.. appetizers, soups, salads, seafood, chicken, pasta, and vegetables to name a few. 
See you next year! :)"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my second visit to this location, and by far my worst restaurant experience of the year.  I should have been warned when the car park was full but the restaurant was not - this must mean that everyone is at Chili's across the parking lot.

To start, our server Ali was quick to say hello and was very friendly.  It took a while to get an order placed, but not too long.  Food for my young daughter arrived first, which she began to eat but also to complain about - over cooked chicken, undercooked broccoli.  Regardless, she's eating.  But 20 minutes pass and my food, a steak salad, is nowhere in sight.  Ali stopped by and told me that the kitchen was having issues with ticket times.  The salad was ready but the steak was not - \"do you want the salad now?\"  I told her that I would wait until the entire entree was prepared.  Then another 20 minutes pass before the salad arrives.  The steak is rare (it clearly sat in the salamander for under 3 minutes, so why did it take 40 minutes to prepare?) and the cut is inedible.  It was filled with grissle and was tougher than leather.  The salad is just ok, and I ate only a few bites before I tried to get the check so we could leave.

In the entire 40 minutes that I waited for food, a manager never stopped by to express their apologies.  In fact, it didn't even look like there was a manager on the floor.  They weren't busy but as the night progressed, finding my server Ali became a real problem.  I waited 10 minutes to find her to simply ask for the check, and then I waited so long for her to return to take the payment that I eventually got up and approached the host stand to make the payment.  Except there was no host.  One of the kinder gentlemen servers finally helped me to settle the check.  The only positive was that the salad had been removed from the bill, yet we still paid for the kids meal.  We left, and I went to get a slice of pizza.

I've been there - heck, we've all been there - bad days are going to happen.  But the lack of communication and human interaction was astonishing.  The core of a restaurant is hospitality, and we received none of that at Romano's."}
{"text":"Another awesome time at Macaroni grill! I went here one night and got the chicken Parmesan. It was so big I only ate half of it. It was so good that I came the next day and spilt the same thing with my cousin. We both loved it, and we got the homemade chocolate cake for desert. DELICIOUS.

Service: 5 stars
We got Sky on our second night. She is so nice and when she came to the table for the first time, she wrote her name on the tablecloth. She made conversation and even remembered me from the night before! 

Food: 4.5 stars
The chicken Parmesan was so good, you should get it. It is very filling and big, definitely enough for 2 people to share. Ask them to split it and bring it out on two plates.

Atmosphere: 5 stars
I loved the music they play, old Jazz? music.
Lighting is perfect and people there are so kind.

Location: 12 stars
Right next to the hotel! I walked! (Stay at Hampton inn and suites on litchfield in Goodyear AZ)

PS: I'm not sure how this place averages 2.5 stars. It should be 329 million"}
{"text":"Nice place..their soup and bread is good.. Good service and enough options for vegans as well. I love this place. Its way better than olive garden in sevice and food."}
{"text":"I walked in with my aunt, and noticed there were only about 5 tables of people and there was no one at the hostess station. After 5 minutes of looking at the hostess gossip with the waitress (who made eye contact with me several times) we were sat to a filthy table which i had to clean myself. The food was not edible, and the service was awful. These people should be ashamed of themselves. I normally would have left as soon as i saw how dirty the table was but at this point i was curious what the macaroni grill was all about and why they still exist. I have no idea !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was beyond phenomenal. Best waitress I've had in a long time. She recommended the goat cheese peppadew peppers and now i cant live without them."}
{"text":"Wavering between nasty and below average throughout. Not being facetious- my waiter may have been on Meth. My friend got a salad with Parmesan crusted chicken (aka fried chicken) and was pleased. Moral of the story- get something they can't mess up = fried or a salad :)"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've gone to a macaroni grill and it'll probably be the last time I go to this one. I came here with my bf and his mom for her bday lunch around 2:30-3 PM and there weren't that many people. I'd say about three other tables. There were two servers and a manager on the floor. Our server was also the bartender but there wasn't anyone at the bar. While she greeted us right away, it took her forever to take our orders and bring out our food. Our salads were sitting on the counter and no one ran it out. I've worked at a restaurant before and if there is food out for that long, another server or the manager would run it to the table but that wasn't the case here. Customer service was definitely lacking on our visit here which is disappointing because the food isn't that bad! 

We were given an herbed bread with olive oil to start. We also ordered calamari which were rather on the small side but the flavor was there. The crispy mozzarella was delicious. Definitely one of the best \"mozzarella sticks\" I've had. I ordered the lobster ravioli which had about 7 raviolis stuffed with some lobster and topped with shrimp and some asparagus. I didn't think it would fill me up but it did. My bf ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and he said the meatballs were just ok. We all had left overs and I would rate the food a 3.5/5. 

I'm not sure why it took a while for our server to come by and for the food to come out when the restaurant was pretty empty. I can't imagine how service would be like when the restaurant is full..."}
{"text":"First time here in YEARS!!  Our service was great, Cassidy was very patient & accommodating since we kept adding to our party!!  
Food was good, except for the fettuccini alfredo (hard, cold noodles with curdling sauce). They did take it back and replace it with obvious fresh!!  
Serving sizes were bigger than the places we've been recently.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Stop the singing, please.  We used to love coming here- at least once per week.  There is a server who is an opera singer and she sings quite a bit.  While I am sure she is good, it is loud, disruptive, long and just awkward.  There was a 3-4 minute period at our table where we couldn't talk because she was so loud.  Doesn't she have sidework or other tables?  Other people may like it, but I'm going to Scottsdale and Shea from now on.  I want a nice, quiet dining experience with my family.  The food is generally very good. Shame."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE experience. The wait was extremely long with a ton of empty tables open. None of the staff looked happy to be there and our waitress was extremely rude. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone and will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Waitress was Lorraine. She couldn't answer any questions bout the food. Didn't explain how the trio combo works. Never checked on me. They didn't pick up any of my dirty dishes til the end of my meal. Found a Nat in my salad and the mgr Jed had his nerve to argue that it wasn't a bug! I didn't ask him I was telling him. Never again will I spend another dollar there. It's not the only Italian place around. Mgr offered to comp my whole meal. I refused offer because I felt he was trying to win me over.. Didn't work, that's why I'm letting other people know... And it was 11am so it wasn't even busy so there was no excuse for the service!!!!!  McDonald gives you better service...."}
{"text":"This location needs help!  
Restroom not clean , no paper towels ! 
Server , no name tag , shirt not tucked in ! 
Never took salad plate or empty beer bottles off table , slow , lazy ! 
Food just ok , we made our own oil and got up and got balsamic ourselves , salad warm not chilled !
Lisa j was our server , we will not be back ever !"}
{"text":"The food here is great and the bread comes out as little squares of happiness. That is about it, 

The staff seemed to be walking in a daze doing busy work. The place was VERY DEAD! There was about 5 waiters, a hostess a manager walking around and a full kitchen staff. They seemed busy but did not get anything done. It was pretty bad that they seemed like they were hiding any emotion and barely talked to each other. They displayed busy work at its finest. 

There was a table of people behind us, and two other tables, and that was it. We were in there for almost 2 hours total. We spent most of the time watching the staff walking around from one end of the restaurant to the other with the same things in their hands appearing to look like defeated zombies. 

Awesome food, and the bread was hot and fresh. But, the long time it took was unreal."}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I start? 
Menu prices: between $14 - $18 for simple pasta dishes.
Service: had to have two dishes taken back- one for making the dish incorrectly, and one because the food was cold. (Wait, the food was cold? Don't they claim to make your food from scratch, right before your eyes?)
Appetizers came after 45 minutes. Side salads came 20 minutes after that. Another 40 minutes bring the entrees (lukewarm)
Taste: I'm glad it took so long to bring our main course out. It gave me a solid hour and a half to enjoy Macaroni Grill's last, and only, claim to fame- their bread with olive oil. Everything I tasted was overwhelmed with cheese and salt. 

Never coming here again. Wouldn't recommend. Consider your old roommates cooking before this."}
{"text":"Loving this place.  Yah it's a chain.  So what?  They provide a quality product at a fair price consistantly.  The chianti is great with any pasta on the menu.

I always opt for the \"create your own pasta\".  Very reasonable and you can pick from four sauces, five or six pastas and add veggies, meat whatever you want.  Not a bad deal.  Home baked bread is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Yah it's a chain restaurant....So what?  The prices are very reasonable and if you select the \"create your own\" pasta, you have nothing to complain about.

Add in a nice house Chianti with your meal of complimentary rosemary bread, superb appetizers and VERY reasonably priced desserts, and you have a nice dinner without breaking the budget.

Going back."}
{"text":"Not my favorite went once a few years back for my husbands bday and never came back again..to each their, just not for me! But I did like the warm bread and herbs in olive oil. I've been on the look out for an authentic Italian restaurant in my area and haven't came across one. The decor and ambience is great on another note."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here Tuesday night because neither of is had never been. We had no idea it was even an Italian restaurant lol. We were seated right away by an older, very sweet hostess. Chris was our server (i believe he was also bartending) and he was wonderful. He met all of our needs (even though we are extremely easy haha) and made me a deliciously strong blood orange cosmo. We ordered 2 appetizers, the mac & cheese bites and the bruschetta. Both were delicious! My only complaint about the bruschetta is that you have to put the toppings on yourself. Anyway, I ordered the buffalo chicken parm and my boyfriend ordered mamas trio (chicken parm, Fettuccini alfredo, and lasagna) When the food came out, you could tell the food had been sitting in the window for awhile.. but luckily we are both in the restaurant industry and understand. My buffalo parm was pretty good... but I love buffalo sauce haha. You can pretty much put it on anything and it will taste good. I also tried a bite of all of my boyfriends items and really wasnt impressed. The fettuccini was okay, very basic. The lasagna probably could've been good, but unfortunately it had gotten cold extremely fast. I'm guessing because it was the trio and was just sitting on the plate instead of in a baking dish keeping in all the heat. The chicken parm was my least favorite.. pretty bland. My boyfriend loved my buffalo parm and said he'd probably order it next time! We barely ate our entrees because we were stuffed from the bread and appetizers. All in all it was a pretty okay experience. We decided we will definitely be back to try it again!"}
{"text":"I will never ever come here again!! I used to come here all the time, not sure what happened to this place! So much went wrong on our visit.....

1.) Our server was horrible, we literally got our cocktails when our food came. The restaurant was dead! Zero reason for such lack of service. The bartender was busy chatting with someone so I guess she couldn't make our drinks or our server forgot to put the order in. The server never brought a spoon to my aunt, even after she asked for it twice! When she asked for it the server got annoyed. At the end she had to use a fork... Classy!!! Thanks!

2.) The salad was a joke.... Are they going thru bankruptcy? It was pretty much lettuce... Really?

3.) We didn't get bread plates. 

4.) When we got our food we were still working on our salad. Big no no! 

5.) I cannot express or even describe the presentation of our entrees. It was a joke! We eat the same entree on all of our visits and I must say this was very upsetting. I didn't eat any of my food. We ordered a plate spilt for two. I'm sorry, I know exactly how it's supposed to look and taste...I've been eating here for 15+ years. My mother tried to eat her portion and left it. She said it tasted old. 

6.) Does anyone there want to work!? Honestly I'm in shock that we had these many issues in one place at one time. Not acceptable! 


I have to say I felt like I was in a reality show getting punked! I've had bad service before but this was honestly the icing on the cake. I can now see why they have horrible reviews and the place is always dead!!!! Huge giveaway! Stay away!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We received poor service during our visit. The appetizers came out cold. Once the food was ready the manager brought it to the table. We had salad, bread and app plates all over the table. The manager sat the food down as we pushed the plates to the said. As fast as she arrived she was gone. She did not clear plates for us, did not offer to refill our empty drinks and did not offer us cheese for our pasta. Never asked us if we needed anything. Our server was also the bartender. She was too busy cleaning the bar to care about us. She had no one in the bar area and was not making any drinks but would not come over to check on us. Overall very poor service and not great food."}
{"text":"Great food. They are very considerate and alter the food to your taste. Service has been super friendly."}
{"text":"Yet again I had to go to this place and yet again I come up with the same question
\" WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF SERVING WATER IN THOSE SMUDGY BOTTLES??\"
and YES! yet again i saw some floaters in my water....i would make this a 1 star review if not for the chicken marsala and hot complimentary bread"}
{"text":"Just a quick review of Macaroni Grill. 

I've been to this location several times and I've never been disappointed. The service is always pleasant and fast and the food is pretty darn good for a chain. 

I've tried some of their pasta dishes and had the grilled pork chops once and they were quite good. I ordered them on a whim and was pleasantly surprised with them. And they make a great Insalata Blu which is bibb lettuce, walnuts, red onions, grated bleu cheese all tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. 

The bread they serve with the olive oil and cracked black pepper is always pleasing. And they have a great blackberry mint iced tea. Yum. 

The music they play is a great mix of Italian opera and the Italian crooners of the 50's such as Frank Sinatra. And hopefully there will be a birthday or two while you're there. They usually have a singer who does a great job of \"Happy Birthday\" in Italian. (What does this person do besides sing? Is that all they do? Anyone know?) 

Oh, and if you use the restroom they play lessons in Italian while you are....um...doing your business. Pretty cool.( I just hope that if I ever need to use Italian in an emergency I don't have to duck into a bathroom to remember it.) 

If you're in the mood for some good Italian food with good portions and friendly attentive service, Macaroni Grill can't be beat in my book."}
{"text":"In the handful of times I have been to Romano's in a handful of different cities I left every time with either the runs or a terrible stomach ache the next day. It's not that the food is terrible (it's simply bland and boring Italian franchise food) or that the restaurants are dirty. I think what my stomach keeps trying to teach me is that with all the delicious food options in the country, I am wasting way too much money on a sub-par, over-priced restaurant like this.

It so happens that this seems to be the restaurant of choice when my friends get to pick where we eat. Unfortunately this means I probably need to find new friends who have more self-respect. 

Seriously, do yourself a favor and try an authentic Italian restaurant in Cleveland (of which there are an abundance). You won't regret missing out on Romano's. I particularly don't like this specific location because the staff are fairly unfriendly and don't make up for the mediocre food at all."}
{"text":"We went Wednesday evening to Macaroni Grill to their Stephanie and Sunset location.  I was disappointed the menu has been so condensed. If you have a request, they will try to compensate. Food and service was top notch and pricing is excellent!"}
{"text":"Overall it was a good experience. Parking works out, the food is good, service was even at least up to par. My only gripe is that they have more healthy and vegetarian choices. Most of the pasta comes with chicken and almost all the salads have some meat. Maybe try some tofu, or leaving meat out of the dishes and make the meat an add on."}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill is a nice casual place.  We've been here a few times.  Today they had a coupon special for the \"Choose 2 Combination\", so we went.

The service was really good.  Waitress was attentive, and the manager stopped by twice.

Their bread is very good.  Much better than Olive Garden's bread sticks, for example.  And they serve it with olive oil and pepper (optional).

We both got the \"Choose 2\".  It was a good portion for lunch.  I had a soup that was basically a very good tomato soup, and the pomodoro pasta (no meat).  Plus I ordered a side of meatballs.  Very good stuff.  My wife had a special salad (had a balsalmic), and the chicken option in the \"choose 2\".  She really liked them.

I'd say they're a tad pricey, but not bad.  And the food is very good for a chain restaurant.  Better than most similar places."}
{"text":"Little niece turned 8 and for some reason she wanted to come here. Actually I think I know why, their chocolate cake. We arrived a few minutes late and our whole family was already seated. Our server was named Joseph and he was amazing. Checked up on us often, made sure our drinks were filled, and anything upon our request. The boyfriend and I shared 2 appetizers on their 2 for $9 deal. Can't remember the name of one but it was baked cheese with prosciutto, the other one was loaded fries. Both okay not bad. For our entree we shared the mushroom ravioli. Super creamy and yet very light. Over all food was okay just not amazing. But I must say that we just had a great experience over all. Food came out fast, my niece got her chocolate cake which was on the house and she had a great time. That was pretty much the goal and it was met. Thank you Joseph for being what I call a great server."}
{"text":"Had a create your own pasta.....it was a snooze. Just plain ole boring. My Partner has the Fettucine  said it was dull and bland. The Manager kept coming by our table trying to get some kind of reaction from us...we answered like Zombies because the atmosphere was like Night of the Living Dead.....dark and drab with lifeless Servers. You could hear pin drop on  Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Please do not order the steak here. The ribeye was like cardboard. It's hard to explain. It was over seasoned and the cut was like nothing I have ever experienced. 
The waitstaff was excellent and the bruschetta and the meatball were excellent.
If you dine here stick to the pasta."}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 I have a big family. We had a wonderful waiter however one of the Littles ones spilled some bread on the ground so we asked a near by waiter that was sweeping something up of he could get the spilled bread real quick cause it was becoming a mess. He huffed and puffed and was so rude pretty much acted like it was a huge inconvenience. We stated that much to eachother when he walked away and the waiter came back and said what did you just say after I walked away so we told him he was very confrontational. He ruined our dinner and made us all uncomfortable this was moments before our food arrived. I expressed my need for the waiter to apologize for ruining our dinner to the manager but he refused to have him apologize. Gave us free desert and thought that was enough however I will Never Ever Go There Again. Ruined 10 people's night over spilled bread. Short dark haired waiter Rude Rude Rude Rude!!!!!"}
{"text":"I remember this place being a lot better.  I was up at Desert Ridge and decided to check out one of my favorite restaurants for dinner since it was my birthday.  My favorite go-to dish for this place is the Pasta Milano.  I remember first eating it in highschool and have loved it ever since.  Every time I visit, this is what I order, sans mushrooms of course.  Ew, fungus.  The bread seemed a bit bland, but the side caesar salad I ordered with my meal was tasty enough.  The pasta, however was completely different than I remember it.  It was bland, nearly tasteless and the chicken tasted like it came out of one of those microwaveable bags you buy at the deli at the grocery store that has pre-cooked bags of chicken to throw into salads.  Fake chicken? Bland pasta sauce? Bland bread? Not what I remembered from this place.  Definitely not worth the $38 we spent for the meal and I will not be returning ever again.  What happened to the Macaroni Grill I remembered?
What a disappointing birthday dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little less crowed every time I go. I stopped in with my wife last night and we were seated quickly. Our favorite part about Macaroni Grill is the bread and olive oil. The bread came out cold and slightly stale. The bread and oil had a strange bitter aftertaste. My wife ordered the steak and potatoes. The potatoes were good but the steak was so tough that She was unable to cut it with the regular knife. I had the shrimp portifino. My food was decent, but a couple of the pine nuts tasted off. The waitress was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been back to this particular location a few times since my initial review three years ago.  I was very impressed by our last visit although our server was a little slow for my taste. The food was very good. I had an Classic pasta dish with sausage and meatballs which was about as good as any I've had. Regretfully our first loaf of bread was not fresh and seemed stale and reheated. It was eventually replaced with the typical hot out of the oven small tear apart loaf.  Two other diners with me had shrimp pasta dishes which I thought were also quite good. The scampi however could have used more lemon as it tasted fresh but slightly flat. We dined on a Thursday not knowing that is half price for a bottle of wine night. We were able to order a $32 bottle of vino along with our meal.  The portions are very large and I would recommend sharing with other diners unless you want another take home left over meal the next day.  I like this location in north Phoenix adjacent to the Desert Hills outdoor shopping center. This certainly isn't the best Italian fare around but it's the best of the chains hands down . . . Better than Olive Garden or Carrabas"}
{"text":"Not horrific but this isn't the same restaurant that I used to get exceptional cuisine from years ago during lunch hours.  Décor still looks great and the place is clean which is a definite bonus.  Too many disappointing visits as of late when it comes to what is being served out of the kitchen and culminating with my last visit this past week.  Cold food and indifferent service.  I wonder how long this location will last?"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but service is sucks. We were there almost 2 hours we didn't even know our servers name. 
My steak was Over cooked , for being in the same industry I couldn't send it back. Sucked it up and ate medium well steak. ( I ordered MR)
They use Plastic bar straws for espresso instead of demitasse spoon."}
{"text":"Nice relaxing atmosphere.  Express lunches  if you need to eat and run.  The shrimp alfredo was delicious with a huge loaf of bread and a salad.  Also, my son said the bread is divine!  Bartender made a beautiful cocktail. I might need one of those next time!"}
{"text":"Arghh... where do I start? Well, allow me to say that I am not a big fan of Macaroni Grill, but the hubby and the kids seem to like it, so we go there once in a while.

Come to think about it, I think we have gotten better service consistently at the Agua Fria and Tatum locations, we also went once in Mesa. However, the few times I have been to the Gold Dust locations... huge disappointments. Once our daughter's wheat pasta was uncooked, and missing the pine nuts (we ordered it because she didn't know what they were). We like the Chianti BBQ Steak, and we have had it at Tatum location, delicious.

We went to this place for Christmas Eve, and we were expecting them to be busy. To our surprise, we didn't have to wait that long to be seated. We got a booth (4 of us) and ordered fetuccini and  Penne Rustica for the kids, hubby the Chianti BBQ steak and the Parmesan Veal Chop for me. We ate one piece of bread. We asked for one more. We ate it. Our server apologized for the delay. Long wait. Our server came back and apologized again. Long wait. Our server nowhere to be seen.  Over 50 minutes went by since our order, which I think it is beyond a reasonable delay. We caught the attention of our server and asked for the manager.
After a while a manager stopped by and explained they had 2 very big parties (he mention the number 17 each, I think) in a back room. Honestly, in my mind this translated to 'we do have customers more important than you'... we said this was beyond reasonable and were considering leaving, he said being Christmas Eve, everywhere would be busy and we would be better off waiting here, he offered a discount... and left. I tried to get his attention to ask how much longer but he didn't hear me or else... About 8-10 min later he brought our food. As he was leaving I said,  pointing to the Chianti steak: this should have prosciutto and crostini, 'and garlic dip', added my husband. He said, the prosciutto is in there... and left. 
Well, in my mind I translated that as \"I am in a hurry, so I am going to treat you like an idiot'. That is the utmost disrespect, and hence the one star. There is no discount that makes up for that. There was no prosciutto in there. At all. 
We caught the attention of our server and mentioned the missing ingredients, and he brought a side of prosciutto, some garlic dip, and a piece of bread... nothing like the crostini we have had at the Tatum location. 

Also, the veal chop is usually huge, and this time it was like half of what I usually get somewhere else. Also, sadly this still may be an improvement, because last time we ordered the Chianti steak here, they didn't even believe us it was supposed to come with garlic dip... honestly... geeezz, can't they read their own menus? oh well, no more Gold Dust in my macaroni... ever."}
{"text":"We had sworn to never go back to Macaroni Grill, specially the one at Gold Dust, where we have had quite horrible experiences (as you can probably tell by the bad rating they have, 2.5 stars).

Came here today for a work lunch (not my place of choice, obviously) but our server Mary took excellent care of us and made this overall a great experience. Kudos to Mary, she was very friendly and accommodating to our big group (10+)

They no longer have the warm spinach salad with scallops on the menu but she mentioned I could still order them. I got it without pine nuts (again) but when I mentioned to Mary she promptly took care of it.

Again, the food was good, but what made this a great experience was out server Mary."}
{"text":"Crazzzeee Holiday traffic, we ended up trapped at Desert Ridge a few days back and decided to make the best of it : )
Well, and we also had a $25 gift card to Macaroni Grill...
We were seated promptly and our server was very nice and friendly.

Bread was the best ever... even when it is right out the oven sometimes it is tough, specially the crust. But this time it was so light and fluffy... a real treat.

I got the 4 course meal with chicken and sausage spiedini. Hubby had a seasonal dish... some sort of big red pot with rigatoni I think, sausage and meatballs.
Both were good."}
{"text":"Got a gift card so decided to check it out.  Friday night around 730pm and place is almost empty.  Sat quickly by Jessica who was our server as well.  Ordered drinks and when they came ordered apps, the hot bread arrived and barely put on table when apps arrived.  She tried to take our order for entrees, I asked how long they would take as we just got our apps, oh it will take some time so I better put it in now.
We had mac and cheese bites with truffle sauce and bruschetta, we were barely half way through the apps when the entrees arrived. 
My fettuccine sauce was so thick and kinda tasted like blue cheese which is not my favorite.  Johan had a pork shank, it was like pulled pork with a bone, it was served with roast veges and delicious Parmesan roasted potatoes.
Meals were ok, would not order them again.  The server was ok, but the food timing was terrible, way to quick, felt like we were being rushed."}
{"text":"Server was Cathy and she was phenomenal.  We never had to ask for anything, she anticipated our needs like a seasoned professional.  Kept our drinks full and was the reason our meal timing was perfect.
Love the hot bread and olive oil.  We started with the meatballs and loaded fries, both were delicious.
Entrees we had pizza and chicken under a brick, was crispy and juicy, with roasted potatoes and broccoli.
Would definitely recommend this location and server."}
{"text":"I come here mostly for their happy hour.  I like that they have two daily happy hours.  I go to the later one because that time is more accommodating.  The times I've been, it's never been busy, so service is not an issue.  I've tried both their house red and white wines. For $3 a glass, it's a super, duper good deal. And they're not cheap on the pour either.   Both are very good.  The pizza, though, I didn't care for much.  

I also like that they provide crayons and the place setting serves as a paper of doodling.  Some of my most artistic creations are the result of having one too many glasses of wine.  

So, if you're looking for a mellow restaurant with happy hour schedule and cheap drinks, then give this place a try."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've always loved macaroni grill. We go all the time, that will definitely be changing. Our server was incredible, hence why we left him a $20 tip on a $19.85 tab.  First of all, the bread was crispy almost stale like it had been sitting there for hours. We ordered the create your own pasta, we ordered two different kinds. A tomato creamy and a tomato basil garlic. Both were not good. Too salty and just bland no flavor. We told our server even tho my BFF doesn't ever want to voice her opinion ( I get it we don't wanna be the pain in the ass complaining but sometimes its warranted ). Our amazing server took both dishes off and only charged us for what we actually ate. It sucks I seriously love this place, I hATE olive garden!!"}
{"text":"I loved the fresh baked bread, the veal parmesan, the salad and the service. Monday night...Not a holiday. They had more staff than they needed. Maybe 1/3 of the tables were occupied. I really did enjoy my meal. It was a great experience. Megan was my waitress.

And you know, I think it was really inexpensive. And quick.

I went back on Tuesday. Colleen also provided excellent service. 

I didn't care for the New England Clam Chowder, however. I'm not a potato fan and it had too many. And they were small, uniform cubes so I couldn't just push them out of the way and get to the soup. And they were too firm for my tastes."}
{"text":"Getting right to the point: absolutely horrible service. 20 minutes to get our drinks, finally got our salads after 35 minutes after seating, \"bread right out of the oven\" still cold in the middle, saw our server three times in almost 50 minutes and still do not have our entrees. After about 75 minutes (but who is counting) dinner was served. Well, someone else's dinner was served to me. It was corrected and my meal was still warm, not hot. Well we finished our dinner and now to hunt down our server... 110 minutes later we get our check. When I asked if they were short handed tonight, she looked at me with all seriousness and replied \"oh, it's really messed up\". That about sums up my LAST visit to Romano's Macaroni Grill. Unfortunately Yelp does not allow for a Zero-Star rating so this restaurant is granted a higher rating than deserved."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I have been here recently and its awfully BLAND. I don't think the water the pasta is cooked in is even salted. New Chef perhaps?! Early this week I received an email for their special 2 lunch meals for $10 and I'm still not interested. I'm not sure if its just this particular location(Research Dr) that taste plain but eheheh nope this place is just not \"it\". The location doesn't help either, its hidden in between 2 hotels so unless you know its there you'd stumble upon it on accident."}
{"text":"Took my girl here a few days before Christmas.  She was really in the mood for spaghetti and ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  When it came out, which took a long time, she said it tasted like the canned chef boyardee.  I started laughing and said she surely must be exaggerating.  After I taste test, yes she was right.  It tasted exactly like they pulled it out of the chef boyardee can.  I know because that used to be mine and her favorites growing up.  lol.  We'll I think this place is overpriced for the plate.  She did not finish it.

I ordered the penne rustica pasta.  It was decent but lacked any depth.  The bruschetta appetizer was also decent however they gave me mostly burned bruschetta bread.  They couldn't even do that right.  The Baked Prosciutto & Mozzarella was disgusting.  I tasted rotten - literally.  Both of us agreed.  

The only good part.  The bread is awesome!! The one they serve free with your orders.  Not sure what executive chef runs this kitchen and what their standards are."}
{"text":"I've been contemplating these last days on whether I was going to make this review or not but I am because Christmas Eve really sucked at Macaroni Grill. I called a month in advance for reservations, called back the week prior to make sure the host/hostess put us on the list and even called the day before to confirm the number of people in the party and time of the reservation yet when we arrived Sunday no one could find my name or # on the list so yeah whatever it's not like it was packed but it seems there's miscommunication at the front desk in general. They didn't have a clue to where they were going to seat us we asked for a booth there was one open next to the kitchen which i would have loved to seat in but they took us all the way to back in the corner where we didn't receive much well anything we sat at the table for a good 15-20mins before being approached by a server (did I mention it wasn't even packed and still not a single waiter around). So we ordered 2 antipasti for $9.99, chicken fettuccine & penne rustica. The antipasti were kinda mediocre but it seemed that when it came to main entrees ummm we'll check the picture and tell me the issue if you can? The chicken fettuccine I didn't get a chance to get a picture of but my partner said it was cold when it arrived as if it's been sitting up at the counter for a good 15-20min wait. My penne rustica was dried out, not stove hot it wasn't even warm it was more like room temperature. Look I understand working the holidays sucks but can't you get the appropriate dishes to the tables prior to the meal being ruined? I didn't complain because I'm sure the waiter already hated that day and his customers in general plus I don't wanna be responsible for ruining anyone's Christmas but I'll just not return on a holiday, sadly this isn't my 1st bad experience at this location the previous time was Easter"}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant twice in the past month and after our very positive experience I was surprised to see the number of negative ratings on yelp.  Perhaps the biggest difference between our excellent experience and the below expectation reviews we've read is that this restaurant has recently had changes in management from the top down.  The new General Manager has clearly made a difference and his Assistant Managers seem to be carrying forward the emphasis on quality service as well as quality food presented excellently.  We were impressed with the customer interaction from both management and servers and we were very happy with our food selections as well.  One item I would heartily recommend is the Shrimp Portafino and also the Chicken Under a Brick.  If you like wine, be sure to have your dinner served with a bottle of Luna Merlot."}
{"text":"Had lunch this past Sunday around 1:30 pm. Pretty crowed. Took advantage of their BOGO free entree. Had the chicken scaloppine with artichokes and mushrooms in a lemon butter sauce. Liked it a lot, very buttery, if you like that style. Pork chop entree with risotto was good also. Not crazy about the chianti sauce. Wines are still 1/2 price and our server was very good; friendly and efficient. Last 3 times service and food is a vast improvement from a few months ago."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of macaroni grill in the past, but this location has gone way downhill, both in service and food quality.  After being seated and waiting almost 10 minutes I had to go find a waiter.  Then the food came and it was blah.....I ordered the mamas trio and the chicken was about 2\" square, the lasagna was greasier than microwave stouffers, and the fettuccini was average at best.  I didn't say anything at the time, and at the end the waiter asked if he could make me something to go.  The manager came over to talk to me, and after sharing my experiences, he told me that \"he wasn't allowed to change anything, he was still in training\" but then gave me his life story about his 21 yrs in the food industry.  I will not be back here again."}
{"text":"I have not been to the Resturant for over 6 years and decided to go with my bae and the menu is bogus. I am not a fan and I am not sure I will ever go back. My order did not have a spicy connotation to it but when I received my food, I could not eat it bc it was SooooOo hot, spicy. The waiter was apologetic and the issue was corrected but I do not think this resturant is for me."}
{"text":"I expected this to be pretty much like Olive Garden, which it wasn't. And I expected, based on other reviews, that it would be a little pricey for the quality, which it was. 

The bartender was not very nice, I think he was annoyed that we made it before happy hour ended (with about 20 minutes to spare), so we got 2 fancy cocktails at $5 each - great for us, but we didn't appreciate his attitude. The waitress, on the other hand, was a doll. Very sweet and made sure we were taken care of. 

The food was mediocre. If it was cheaper, we would have loved it, but it was about $20 per plate, which in any other situation would be no big deal, but the portions were small and the food was that of a typical cheap italian place, so we thought it should be priced as so. 

We might try the lunch special sometime, but otherwise we probably won't return for dinner unless their prices change."}
{"text":"I've never had a great experience at Macaroni Grill but decided to try it again since I heard their menu had changed.  The menu may have changed but that's all that's changed.  We sat for a good 10-15 minutes before the manager came over to take our drink order, saying our waitress was bogged down with other tables.  I looked around and the bartenders were waiting on other tables.  It looked like there were only 2 waitresses in the entire restaurant.
I ordered fettucine alfredo and was disappointed immediately when it arrived because they had ground up pepper sprinkled all over the top of it.  Why would any restaurant put pepper all over someone's food??  Well, apparently they did it to disguise the fact that their alfredo sauce has absolutely no flavor.  None at all.  I have had alfredo pasta at fast food Italian places and it's been better than this.  My husband ordered the chicken milanese and it was covered in some sweet sauce that did nothing for the chicken.  The best part of the entire meal was the potatoes that were served with my husband's chicken.  They were really good.  
Overall, it was a complete waste of an hour of my life and $45.  I will never go back again.
Oh, and P.S.  Who serves water in gross bottles with NO ICE??  Yuck!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. First off I was in the place for over 2 hours and waited to be seated for over 10 minutes. When we were seated service was lagging but expected being as management obviously did not schedule enough servers for the night. We spoke with the couple next to us the urged us to leave being that service was terribly and slow. We waited and sat it out due to the amazing specials finally we were approached and our first order was taken. After our order was taken everything was TERRIBLE. No one at out table ate their order, and only 3 out of 5 plates were complimented for the check.

I think the manager took us to be young and stupid and did not take us seriously (although I'm sure we have higher credit scores and income than he). I can guarantee you a group of ASU students have a lot of power and influence and that I will never be back. 

Tables throughout were left dirty and disgusting. Let me stress I WILL NEVER BE BACK. I. WILL. NEVER. BE. BACK. 

I accept that the manger rudely declined my offer to speak with him (probably because we were young). This was rude and ridiculous. I will be calling in the morning. I am done with Macaroni Grill, as long as everyone in our party. 

Thanks for nothing and for charging us. You should close this location or fire the managment team. They're doing nothing but losing money."}
{"text":"We used to like this place a lot but it's been a while since we visited. We stopped by for dinner last night. The waitress was attentive but the food was not what it used to be. I had a chicken scallopini, which is usually my go-to dish at this restaurant. They forgot to put capers on it (clearly states capers in the menu listing) and there were some cooked red things (cherries maybe) on there that typically aren't present. The worst of it, though, was that this dish was absolutely drowned in butter to the point of being disgusting. That's a huge problem with these chain restaurants -- you'd never get that from a mom & pop restaurant. Good food does NOT need to be saturated in butter to have flavor. Further, I ordered coffee afterward and it was lukewarm. The server's solution, instead of popping it into a microwave for 30 seconds, was to add hot water to it, which really wasn't a success as the coffee was still barely warm. There are a lot of things I can give a restaurant a pass on but bad coffee is not one. Every server knows, or should know, that coffee needs to be A)hot and B)fresh. For this experience, I give this restaurant a D."}
{"text":"Oh where to begin.  We came here tonight as we had gift cards and thank god we had gift cards.  

We walked in and a lady was basically yodeling or maybe singing at a guests table.  Little did we know this was going to be our server, Shelley.  We wanted to order a bottle of the Riesling and they said they had one but it was not cold.  We then decided on a Chardonnay and she said they were out of that but recommended the Kendall Jackson.  Because this was much more expensive I asked if they could price match one of the other wines.  She said she was going to go get the manager but ended up coming back herself and was able to price match it.

We then wanted to order.  We ordered the loaded fries and Mac and cheese bites.  We asked if we could order our entrees and she said she was neglecting the other table and would be back however we didn't have bread, our wine yet, and my water was empty.  It took around 35-40 minutes before we had our appetizers on the table.

The fries came and something seemed off.  They looked like fries with cheese sauce on them.  Oh wait, that's exactly what it was.  The chef forgot all of the ingredients.  We were very close to the well where the food comes out of the kitchen so we could hear our server go to the chef and asked  if he knew how to make it.  Not comforting.  

When the Mac and cheese bites arrived the server spilled the sauce all over the table.  They were less than flavorful but after our experience thus far it wasn't surprising.  

I ordered the Shrimp Alfredo, my friend had the Buffalo Chicken Parm with a bowl of Tomato Basil, and my other friend had the Classic Bake.

My shrimp Alfredo was good.  My friends tomato basil was literally marinara sauce.  It was the consistency of that and he ate it as a dipping sauce as opposed to a soup.  While the buffalo chicken Parm had a great buffalo flavor it tasted as though it was warmed up in the microwave.  

Now onto the Classic Bake.  My friend couldn't eat one bite.  The pieces of meat had what looked like tails on them.  And the pasta tasted like there was something seriously wrong with it.  We couldn't figure out what the flavor was but it sure didn't belong in our mouth.  

The server offered us a free dessert for the issues however it wasn't worth it to waste anymore time there.  We got the check and literally nothing was taken off.  After all those issues.. We didn't even tell her about the marinara sauce oh wait Tomato Basil soup.

She then had the manager Ryan come over but you could tell he didn't want to.  With that many server issues the manager should have come over much earlier.  He finally took off the entree and $5 for the loaded fries or lack there of.  

The bathroom looked like it hadn't been touched up in quite some time.  The feminine product box was overflowing and there were paper towels all over the floor.

Being in the service industry I just wonder how this establishment got to the state it is in.  Is it management, is it lack of training.. I don't know but they should figure it out because i don't think they'll be open much longer if this continues."}
{"text":"First time here and more than likely our last. took our server over 5 minutes to greet us.  never mentioned specials or even her name.  after we ordered never saw her again besides at her other tables. food came no server. no check up to see how the food came out.  no refills. best part after my fiance got up to go to the bathroom,  he was gone for a little,  she dropped the check and two boxes almost like we were going to dine in dash!!! stupidity and discrimination all because he's been having stomach issues all day.  was i not still sitting in the booth enjoying my dinner when i was rushed to PAY and LEAVE before he even returned. I had to box up his dinner because the server literally wanted us gone.  chicken marsala was to die for,  server needs to be retrained on attitude and what it takes to wait tables.  still furious from our experience."}
{"text":"I had a gift card so I took the family out for dinner. The boys liked it (ages 14 &17) but for those of us who are looking for quality over quantity... not so great. Started with waitress asking for our drink order. I told her I wasn't sure about wine but really needed water. She brought two lovely glasses of ice water for the boys, but none for the adults. Asked me again about wine and I said I really just wanted some water, and she said they were all out of glasses. She finally poured some into the little glasses they use for wine. No ice. We drained the bottle they put at the table and never saw another one. Ordered the house wine and it was undrinkable. Food was all overly salted (and we had no water!). I had Pasta Rustica, which is supposed to have prosciutto. Instead, there were these thick strips of some kind of ham. Prosciutto is typically sliced very thin. Weird. Also, we ordered salad and got the food first. The server blamed the waitress, who said they were all out of bowls. Maybe they should order some more dishes and glasses! Finally, desert sounded good but was dried out chocolate cake. They serve it with whipped cream and chocolate sauce, probably because the cake is so dry. Glad I didn't pay for this meal with my own dollars."}
{"text":"In the way of chains, it's actually not bad!  The house wine was ok, nothing special but pretty darn special considering this is a chain.  The bread and olive oil was my favorite part of the meal, well really the olive oil.  I honestly don't remember much about my entree except that it was salty, greasy food you would expect from a chain restaurant, but in a good way!  For the price, it was great.  We are not talking a knock your socks off meal but that's not what you came here for, is it?  Good option for a quick lunch before, after or in between shopping.  Decent kid options too."}
{"text":"Romano's Macaroni Grill is a chain restaurant, similar to that of Olive Garden...but Macaroni Grill wins hands-down on deliciousness of food! The chef staff here puts great care into their ingredients and their recipes. Everything we ate there was flavorful (including the crispy fresh mozzarella, the caesar salads, and the chicken parmesan), nothing was dull or lacking. The presentation of the food was also quite nice, and our server was attentive. (Bonus points: our server wrote on our table upside-down - talk about skills!) Great place for lunch, as they take great care to get your food to you quickly if you explain that you're on a lunch break and cannot be gone for an immense amount of time."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese bites and fettucini gorganzola lunch special. Delicious lunch, virtually empty restaurant. Large portions and at a very good price. Drinks were a little pricey. Long Island at 9$ is too much for 2pm but it was a good as any Long Island that I've had"}
{"text":"We have yet to receive our food, so I have plenty of time to write this. We have a party of 18 and we arrived right when they opened with reservations. Took 20 minutes to get water by our incompetent waiter. I watched the salads sit on the window waiting to be picked up for ten minutes. The waiter is not able to bring food and serve it immediately he has to set it on the table next to us then once all the food has been delivered to the side table I hope he will bring it to us. Horribly organized lacks training and customer service skills. Management clearly does not want to help him. Hopefully food will be edible!!!! Update I did get my blackened chicken Parmesan it only took 90 minutes but the manager comped it and apologized for it. It was actually cooked correctly. Still everyone's else's food was lukewarm and uninspiring."}
{"text":"I struggle to ever give more than 3 stars to a chain restaurant, but I had to make an exception due to an exceptional server named Tania (I know, I didn't like the spelling either).
Make no mistake, the food is typical chain restaurant 3 star stuff. Good, but not great. No complaints, but not worth wasting my time on Yelp for.
Tania on the other hand was stellar. I'm confused why she is working here in a chain restaurant when she clearly belongs in a five star strip restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the food was heavenly!  If it would have been appropriate I would have licked the plate!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location before but today I had an outstanding professional experience that *should* be the standard for ALL Las Vegas restaurants. I ordered my lunch online and it said it would be ready in about fifteen. It's close to my house so I headed there. Upon arriving I was promptly greeted by Ryan who looked up my name for my order. He was unable to find it. Puzzled, I took out my phone and showed him the order but I then realized that I didn't hit continue to actually submit the order (my fault and I admitted it). Ryan didn't miss a beat. He said no problem and immediately called out to his chef to fire up my order on the fly. The chef waved to me and got to work. Ryan assured me it would be out in a few minutes. Less than 5 minutes later I'm on my way out with a fresh hot meal and a free fresh bread that was thrown in complimentary. Thank you, Ryan and thanks to the incredibly fast chef for providing a professional atmosphere! I'll be coming back here often! All restaurants need to have this type of service! It's rare but much appreciated!"}

The food was great and very testy  .our waitress was wonderful and gave  us the best service u can get ,by the way her is Lisa.
About six month ago I had lunch with my wife 
And we were not happy about the service .
So I was  impressed today, on top of it the GM 
Come to table twice to make sure everything is going good, Mr Sterling thank you for great experience, 
I'll be coming every chance I have. 
Thank you for great lunch."}

{"text":"Had lunch here this past week. I'm a lunch regular here for the past 5 years. I usually order the Bibb & Blue salad with chicken. But what's strange is they brought me romaine lettuce and not bibb. I showed the server the bottoms of the romaine stalks under my chicken and separated them out on another plate. He went to the kitchen and brought me out a smaller version of the Bibb & Blue salad, guess what? Romaine again... Ugh! Any foodie knows Bibb from romaine!"}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying we have eaten here numerous times and never had a problem.  But we recently had a baby so going out to dinner is not as easy so we thought we would get Curb Side To go.  WORST FOOD EVER!  Everything was over cooked and dry.  I am VERY disappointed in the quality of food that we received."}

{"text":"Went in for a meal on Sunday night.  Not a great move.  The food was really not great even for a chain italian place.  Service was good, we sat at the bar to watch the Sunday night game.  

I'm still not sure if the issue was the poor food, the poor menu, or something I can't nail down."}

On the website it stated \"the greens are included  ,comes with cesar salad.so i go in to pick up and they put 2 containers in bag, i ask where are the salads? The employee stated they do not include salads.so i proceeded to pull up website and manager came over,who stated the website was incorrect but gave me salads,then i got home opened my to-go s and this is what i got!!!  I guarantee you this would never go out to the dining room!! This was $20"}
{"text":"Really nice ambiance and service. The food was delicious and the Tiramusu was great for dessert."}
{"text":"Romano's Macaroni Grill, it's a chain but with consistent food and service. The atmosphere is a cross between an open air piazza and a big city trattoria in Italy. Probably time for a remodel after the same look for over 20+ years. First off the service was friendly and efficient by all involved . It started upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who took us to our table. After ordering our food some rosemary foccacia bread was brought to the table and a bottle of cool water, nice touch. One other nice touch from the server also was when she refilled my Iced tea, she also brought a extra glass with ice in it, loved it, nothing worse than luke warm ice tea on refills.

For appetizers we stared of with the Goat Cheese Peppadews Peppers they where a nice mix of a sweet small pepper filled with tangy goat cheese, drizzled with a balsamic glaze and the Spicy Ricotta Meatballs, which where moist flavorful golf ball size meatballs served in a delicious tomato sauce, with the addition of orange and lemon zest. Though not traditional at all, the zest added a nice flavor to the overall dish.

We then each had a salad. The Bibb and Blue Salad was nice mix of Bibb lettuce, blue cheese, pancetta and walnut, and pickled red onions, with a buttermilk dressing. It was good, but I don't think the pickled red onions added anything to the salad for me personally. The Caesar salad was average. I like mine with a little more zing or punch to it with a little more garlic or anchovy flavor to it.

For entrees we had the Spaghetti Carbonara. I was disappointing with the dish because of its lack of flavor overall, though the pasta itself was some of the best I have had, it was cooked perfectly with good texture and bite, like you would find in Italy. Unfortunately that perfect pasta was swimming in a large pool of water or tasteless sauce (not sure what they were going after there). The pasta dish had a few chucks of nicely cooked pancetta, parmesan cheese and a nicely cooked poach egg on top which all sounds and looked good but did not come together with much flavor. I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to make it eatable. The Chicken Under a Brick was presented nicely and was well seasoned and flavorful, served with some nice roasted potatoes and grilled asparagus, the skin on the chicken was nicely crisp and flavorful. My only slight complaint being that the chicken was a little bit on the dry side. It probably would have been a better dish if it was cooked on the bone. I do understand they are probable cooking it boneless to appeal more to the masses rather than for people that enjoy a perfectly cooked flavorful moist chicken.

Overall I'd say it was a bit better than average. Worth a trip if you're hungry for some Italian and you're in the area."}
{"text":"Happy with the choice. Food was very good. I had the classic Italian bake. Service was slow but they were busy."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this restaurant which is right down the street from my home but my last 2 visits have made me decide to opt for  the longer drive to Olive Garden.

The waitress we had on Saturday Gave us poor service at best and this was after we sat and waited a half hour or more to be seated.  They were supposidly out of bread so we sat with nothing to snack on  from the time we were seated, finally were waited on, order taken to food arrival of close to 30 minutes.

The bread is overwhelmed with rosemary and is not very good - disappointed again.  Makes those never ending garlic bread sticks at Olive Garden seem pretty scrumptious!

The mushroom ravioli I ordered was average and the spaghetti with meatballs was good but the portion size was very small for a price of $13.00.

Needless to say, this is the 2nd time in the past few months I've experienced poor/slow service and less than average food.  All the 3 of us could say was Olive Garden is taking the place of our Italian nights out in the future and good-bye Macaroni Grill..."}
{"text":"Sara is an amazing server. the food is always great, Thursday is half price wine bottles!"}
{"text":"I was here tonight's. Chris the bar tender was great night one, Jordan the bar tender the second night was as good or better. Really good food and relaxed atmosphere right next to my hotel!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. We were the only ones in there. Then another family walked in. THEY got their drinks and bread before us. We could barely break up the bread. The service was SOOOO slow. Like we were one of 2 parties in there, and our waitress was talking the whole time to her coworkers. Their 2 dollar mimosas tasted like straight oj. My raviolis were cold. 
The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because their tiramisu was on point."}
{"text":"This was one disappointment after another...from sit to well still sitting waiting for check, have been waiting for everything yet the waitress \" Shelly\" found the time for a rendition of O solo mio... what the frackasack... o solo feedo the peopleo... and the food  Not to die for... Not to even get the order right... I even was the one to add cheese to the pasta's...i thought that part was funny..Half the dishes ordered were wrong not good and wont... I said WON'T come back....."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Decent taste. Chicken was weird looking though."}
{"text":"THEY HAVE ROACHES!!
It was the most disgusting experience I had ever had, the wait was soo long for our food- which I was willing to look pass that, but when we started eating my boyfriends food was not warm at all the sauce on his pasta was soo thick from not being warm enough.  He decided not eat his food. We all know the lighting in their is dim and the tables have the little candles, so I honestly thought I was seeing things when I saw something move in their little advertising papers they set on the side of the table and NO it was a Roach!!! I immediately stopped eating and we requested our tab, I didn't want to tell my boyfriend because I knew all hell would break loose.  The roach was now walking on the table trying to get my plate. It was soo gross!! My boyfriend saw it and nearly snapped, the waiter brought us the tab and he told the guy there's a roach on the table, the waiter was speechless, he did not say one word. The roach was now on the wall (our table was next to the wall) and he saw it and he still didn't say  anything, my boyfriend said this place is disgusting and you can't say a word about it, all the waiter said was sorry. He didnt offer to comp our tab or anything. We simply got a \"sorry\". We paid the tab and left no tip and left. Never again will we eat there. If there's roaches on the table  which is far from the kitchen imagine what's crawling in the kitchen."}
{"text":"If I could give  NEGATIVE stars,I would!  One of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time!!  Very disappointed in Romano's. 

Right from the moment we walked in, hostess said it would only be a few minutes --no problem, EXCEPT that I counted at least a dozen empty tables & those were the ones I could actually see.   While waiting, the kitchen staff proceeded to slam pots & whatever else at a deafening sound to where we could not hear ourselves talk.  Do they not realize that they are open to the dining area?   

While being seated I commented to the hostess that the place seemed disorganized. She said they had a new manager who didn't know the routine yet AND they weren't expecting the winter visitors so soon. REALLY?   Are you stupid?  IT'S NOVEMBER???  I didn't need to hear this and found it unprofessional.   

We waited 10 min before anyone noticed us. A waiter came over and took drink orders, which we received quickly, but no sugar or silverware.  We were ready to order but could not get the waiter's attention.   I got up and found silverware and sugar on my own.   Finally, our orders were taken but no bread.    After 20 min I got up and went in search of the guy wearing a tie, who I presumed was the manager.  I told him \"20 min and no bread\"!   He brought us some about 5 min later.   Our drinks were never refilled or even asked if we wanted them refilled!    

When dinners were served, waiter did not offer ground pepper or grated cheese.  I got up AGAIN, (at this point they may have thought I worked here), and tracked down a grated cheese caddy that had been left on a sideboard.   Now the waiter shows up to see if we wanted grated cheese!   

The meals were delicious but we had to contend with loud music which made it impossible to converse.  This is a ITALIAN restaurant --- why not play some pleasing Italian tenor music instead if something we would find at a club.  We were not planning on dancing on the table.  Again, no drink refills, even though our glasses were empty at this point.   

I could watch our waiter run to tables all over the restaurant which made no sense to me.   The wait staff did not look particularly happy and appeared instead like they were just racing through the motions to get through the night.   

We needed take home containers and waited another 15 min (at this point I was timing everything).  Finally, the waiter brought them and said they ran out of take-out containers and had to buy some at Pei Wei.   ?????   Is this supposed to be funny?   They were pitiful containers too.   

(SIGH).   We didn't want to take a chance of the waiter disappearing again so we asked for the bill at this time also.   

I guess the bill was also manufactured at Pei Wei.  Guess again --- another 15 min to get the bill and when the server brought it over, he brought new glasses of iced tea!!!!   At this point we thought it was just comical.  
Instead of waiting again, we tracked down the waiter to pay the bill.  

Could not get out if there fast enough.  We wished 'good luck' to everyone waiting to be seated (again, with lots of EMPTY tables). 

This location needs HELP FAST!  The GM needs to get his/her butt in here and TRAIN.  This experience seemed like a place that is on the verge of closing.  Don't they realize that there is tons of competition in DESERT RIDGE?  No one needs to put up with this."}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better AT OTHER MACARONI GRILLS!  This it third time I have tried this location.  Last night we tried it for the last time.  

I ordered a side Caesar salad with Pasta Milano--light on the sun dried tomato.  My son ordered Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken.  My younger children ordered the macaroni and cheese from the kids menu.  

First, they forgot the bread.  When it arrived it was small and hard.  They also forgot my salad.  Second the pasta in the Pasta Milano was not even close to al dente.  It is was completely raw in the center of the Farfalle,  I counted only 5 pieces of chicken in the whole serving.  And remember the light on the sun dried tomatoes?  Yep, they were all there and more.  The sauce was largely nonexistent though. While the sauce was missing one thing I did find was cartilage: a very large chunk!   My son's Fettuccine Alfredo showed up sans chicken.   At least the little ones were happy.

The location is a tough one.  It is in the very busy Desert Ridge Marketplace area.  The parking lot is too small, as it is shared with three other restaurants.  I will also say it was on a busy Friday night.  However, this is the third time.  I just won't be back.  I am beginning to wonder about the management here.  It feels too fast food.  

Macaroni Grill is a chain restaurant with other locations and a decent menu.  I will have to go back to the one on Gold Dust."}
{"text":"My mother loves this place, God knows why, but we come here 5-6 times a year. This place stinks. Literally. Ladies, use the restroom at home because the one here smells like total ass. 

Service is so so, conserve your beverage as your server will hover until your order is placed then reappear when you start chewing so you either have to wave at the empty glasses or eat the ice. They also have a bad habit of not clearing the dishes and dropping the check. My kids always want dessert and the servers rarely ask, oh you want a dessert menu? Ok.

Food is meh at best. Step above Olive Garden. Maybe."}
{"text":"We went here on Father's Day and had a very enjoyable meal.  Overall the food was good and arrived quickly.  The service was great.  We'll be going back."}
{"text":"Service was 2 stars, the guy did not want to be there. 

Food was 3.5 stars I had a Pollo Caprese which is a grilled chicken breast in a lemon butter type sauce served with thin noodles and cherry tomato sauce. It also had 4 small bites of cheese which I suppose was homemade mozzarella? 

While it was all good, it was just boring. Nothing stood out and said \"Hey you really like this\" 

Just average food. Now I remember why it has been years since we have been there."}
{"text":"We ate here a year ago and haven't been back since because the service and food was so bad. Today we thought that they might have improved so we thought we'd give it a shot - NOPE.  Still the same as it was last year.  Initially I was going to give this 2 stars for the bad service, but then our food arrived.

Service was slow. Extremely slow.  We were there at 2:00 PM and the place was a ghost town.  We had to wait 10 minutes before any of the employees would acknowledge we were even in the establishment.  Took another 5 minutes to seat our party of 3 at a booth.  They seated us right next to the restroom when the rest of the restaurant was open and available.

Our table was set for two, but they said they would bring another place setting.  Eventually our waiter showed up to take our drinks - I got a feeling of resentment from him, kind of like he'd rather be anywhere but here (that feeling was mutual).  When we didn't want any wine he got a little miffed.

The food came out cold and nasty.  The water bottles that they use to pour water from were filthy - INSIDE THE BOTTLE!!!

Seriously...  This place is right in the heart of Scottsdale.  There are probably 100 to 200 restaurants with in a 1 mile radius.  Any one of them is a better choice than here.  Scottsdale has some PHENOMENAL eateries, don't waste your time at Romano's Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"Love the food here and the atmosphere. Service as always was great. They give you such good portions for the price and you can always find something your in the mood for on the menu."}
{"text":"I have given this place more than a few fair shots. Every time I am disappointed.

So going out to eat at a restaurant encompasses two major components: service and food.  Sometimes one can outweigh the other and save the outing.  Not here though.

Today's lunch was a birthday lunch for some friends from the office.  We call ahead and place the order so we can accommodate the hour lunch, which kudos to this place, they took the order ahead of time.  That is the only good thing I can say.

So a few of us arrive and we're gestured to our table. Not led, not even directed, just gestured in the general direction.  Uhm ok. 

We find the table by counting the seats at the table, we sit, and we're waiting for the rest of our party.  I'm thinking they're going to take the drink order, but no, the server says our food will be right out.  The entire party isn't even at the table yet.  What about the drink order, what about the bread, what about a greeting?

I go to the restroom, and I'll say they have clean and well-stocked restrooms.  Good job. 

I return to the table and our meals are set around the table.  People are still missing from the table, there's no bread, and the server hasn't even asked about drinks.  Uhm ok.

So since the food is getting cold I try it.  It's bland, flavorless, and the pasta is undercooked.  Really?

The rest of the party arrives.  Everyone has furrowed brows in confusion.  The server reappears and then asks for the drink order.  Still no bread.  

A friend's eggplant parmigiana was burned.  The replacement that came a while later was just as bland and flavorless as my pasta dish.

After a few requests, there's finally bread on the table.  Which would be exciting if it weren't stale.  

Past halfway through our meals, the server offers up fresh-ground parmesan.  Thanks, that would have been great at the beginning of the meal!

So the meal ends.  I am doodling on the table (they do provide crayons and the table cloth is white butcher paper, so that's cool).  The check is paid.  We leave.

Sadly, this is not the only bad experience here.  I've had visits where orders have been completely wrong and replacement meals have come after everyone else is done with their food, where I've been made very uncomfortable by the way-too-handsy server who creeped me out and I had to clearly indicate to not touch me again, and where I've had to flag down a random busser just to get some water.

If it weren't for the fact that they take orders in advance, the clean bathrooms, and the fact that I can doodle on the tablecloth, I would only give this place one star."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Manager doesn't seem to care that his servers are drowning and understaffed. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The only thing worth eating here is the bread and oil. The spaghetti and meatballs were gummy noodles, tastless sauce (like worse than the $1 can of Hunt's at the grocery store) and tiny rubbery meatballs that seem to be from the frozen food isle. The salad was wilty. The chicken alfredo had the same gummy noodle problem and hardly any taste. If it wasn't for the gift card, I would not have eaten here. We also went on a weekend around 4pm to beat the dinner rush and when we left an hour later, there was hardly a soul in the place. Since the wait staff had hardly any table they just annoyingly bugged us about our food every 2 minutes. I like being waited on and all, but let me get a bite down before you come back. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Yeah I know; it's a chain.  However, I dig the Mac Grill.  They always seem to have great customer service which always enhances the eating experience.  Their app bread was hard, but dip it in olive oil/balsamic and we're golden.  Their lunch special was cool; soup or salad and half sandwich.  It's quick, light and tasty!  Price was good as well...so what's your problem and why can't you go - no excuse not to attend :)"}
{"text":"Had the most excellent service today! Two of our main courses took a little extra time and for that they ended up compensating the two meals and offered dessert on them! The waiter, Keaton was very attentive and friendly. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, I really... really do.  But after going here four times in the last year-ish and having the same experience every time, I am compelled to write:

The food is always pretty good, not great but it can be surprisingly very good at times.  I hope you're not hungry when you dine at this Romano's Macaroni Grill, because you'll get seated, and then you'll watch your server walk past your table 3 or 4 times without even looking at you. Then maybe they will stop by and take your drink order.  They will bring you their usual bread, in an effort to make nice and to think you will forget that they made you wait for your drink.... 

Then they will repeat the same routine, walking past your table, but this time, about 5 or 6 times, even though your drinks are empty and your menus closed on the end of the table. 

Finally, they will take your order ~ spaghetti & meatballs and chicken parmigiana please... 

They will stop by 2 to 3 times as you wait to let you know that your food will be out in just a minute or two.   

45 minutes after you ordered, your food will arrive to your table with out an apology about the long wait, and they will try to tell you \"the kitchen got soooo backed up.\"  Seriously???  We can see the kitchen from our table dude... Come on...  Not to mention it's a Tuesday night with the dining room is half empty?  But maybe it takes Romano's 45 minutes to boil noodles and fry a chicken cutlet?

Anyway, I really want to like this place, because the food can be really good, and the restaurant is in a nice location.  But I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon after having the exact same experience four times.  

BTW ~ we don't care for the new way your serving water by using tap water to fill a pitcher, then to be carried over to fill a container located on the center tables only to fill yet another vessel, a bottle then bring it to us as if it's bottled H2O along with two small glasses.  Seriously?"}
{"text":"I have never been to this restaurant and decided to go for lunch.  I had an amazing waitress Anna, she had great recommendations.  I had the lunch special, it was great.  This will be one of my new go to restaurant.  Thank you Anna."}
{"text":"Seriously if I could give them a negative number, I would. A friend gave me a gift card so I gave them another chance. My bad. I placed my order on line and was given a pick up time. I arrived maybe 4 minutes early,  and went up to the cashier/ host stand to pick up my order.  It was early in the evening and maybe 4 or 5 tables with several employees kinda milling around. After standing at the host stand for about 5 minutes, someone finally came up and asked if I had been helped. She said they were bagging up my order it would be a few minutes. About 10 minutes later a guy came in to be seated, I'm still standing at the front waiting for my order, another employee comes up, acted like I was invisible and starts talking to the guy behind me. Even the guy gave me a weird look like wtf? Now the girl bagging my order has been standing in the same spot the whole time with an empty kids cup and a lid. Days they were still waiting on a freaking salad I think and she couldn't find the milk. So she asks me if I want to pay. I told her that would be great! My check was $53.46 I gave her a $40 gift card and $50 bill. Then she tells me that they forgot to give her a cash drawer, so she disappears in the back for another 8 minutes. She finally appears with the drawer and proceeds to count it. Finally she hands me $13.46 change. Now I'm a very patient person, but now I'm starting to get slightly irritated. I say NO try again. I owed you $13.46 I gave you $50. So she gets the kitchen manager, which by the way never touched a glove or washed his hands the entire time I was there (almost 30 minutes) to help het figure out how to re open the check to put in the proper amounts to figure out my change. And this is where the F bombs start dropping. I said this is f n bs. Give me my $36.54 Give me my food and figure out your F n computer shit later!! But we are out of milk! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I would have to say my experience pretty much echos everyone else's here.. 30 minute wait for salads which were C- quality (lukewarm, soggy lettuce). I forsee another casualty just like it's next door restaurant that went belly up unless some re-organization takes place.."}
{"text":"I decided to give this location a second visit over the holidays after having had a mediocre experience the first time.  Also, it happened to be the most convenient location for all of us to meet.  I have had wonderful experiences at both the Desert Ridge and Agua Fria locations.  45 minutes after we arrived my daughter received her entree.  5 minutes later, I told her to start eating.  The server said she would check on our meals.  15 minutes later, I saw what appeared to be one of the chefs talking with a patron at a nearby table.  The patron visibly upset.  I waved him over and he asked how our meals were.  I told him I wouldn't know, since we were missing two of them.  He did not apologize but simply said they were busy and he would check.  5 minutes later we received our meals which were terrible.  The pasta was hard, the sauce burnt and I'm almost certain had been run through the microwave. I will return to the two locations mentioned above but never, ever again to this location."}
{"text":"Good food.  Unpleasant hostess.  I like that.they have lite calorie options."}
{"text":"I don't normally frequent the \"chains\" cause I like to give the locals the biz, but I had a gift card, and I took my daughter.  

It was early (6:00) on a Sunday, and there was a waiting list in the dining room, so we ate in the bar.  Taylor was the bartender and server.  I told him what I wanted to drink with not too much this and not too much that, and he made it perfect.  Thank you, Taylor!  I had the shrimp portofino and my daughter had the lobster ravioli.  I am only giving the four stars cause I thought the shrimp should have had some kind of flavor to it -- It was a bit on the bland side -- and my daughter's ravioli was a bit on the sparse side.  That being said, both dishes were good.  The pasta was flavored to perfection.  I wouldn't have minded having chili peppers on the table cause I like my pasta spicy hot, but that's okay.  That's my taste.  The hostess forgot to give us menus, and Taylor, our server/bartender was surprised at that.  Slight oversight, I'm sure.  No big deal."}
{"text":"I gave it 3 stars because we've had better... both service and taste :(
We ordered Sprite to drink and we got seltzer water. I ordered Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and got undercooked pasta and no shrimp...

So, only 3 stars :("}

{"text":"Never again! The service was terrible! My noodles were not cooked! The bread was cold! I was so disappointed! The only thing I enjoyed was my beer!"}
{"text":"Probably best to avoid this location.
We went on a Friday night around 8pm and sat at a table in the bar area. Server came over after about 8 minutes. Got our drink order and when asked if I wanted wine, I asked if they do samples before buying. The response: \"I mean 1 or 2, not a lot.\" I'm sorry, what? Do you want to sell me a glass of wine or not? 10 minutes go by and drinks finally come back. We order our meals and are served in about 25 minutes. The server came back to give salads and then check on our meals a few times, each time NOT TAKING THE DIRTY AND FINISHED PLATES OFF OF THE TABLE! We had a small stack going at one point and he finally took everything. I had the seafood pasta which was very good (and $20)!!! Until about 2-4am when I woke up 3 separate times and was throwing up said $20 pasta dish. We sent corporate an email, never heard back. Called corporate and were connected to Risk Management. So... you don't care that I got sick and had a lousy dining experience, you just want to make sure I'm not going to sue you?! To this day, the manager never followed up with us. Save your money and go to Carrabbas. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Great menu for tasty mix of flavors that have beautiful presentation with friendly waiters. Thank you for a nice brunch!"}
{"text":"4 stars solely on service. Food wasn't that good, appetizers were, but not so much our main dishes. I don't remember her full name but \"TK\" was our server and she was just so wonderful and very attentive! She was too cute and sweet.. We'd give it another shot but only if she was our server!"}
{"text":"So, very disappointed! We went there about six months ago and I ordered the Pork Shank Cremeni, it was delicious! Now, we go back last night and I ordered the Pork shank once again and my son ordered the Veal Valdostana. First of all, it took the waiter, who seemed nice, but somewhat flustered 1/2 hour to even get our drink order. When he finally made it around to us (mind you, we were there at 4 o'clock and there were only maybe five tables with people seated and 4 serve staff.) We placed our appetizer for the crostini, when it arrived the tomatoes were old, sour and whilted, that should have been a sign. After about 30 minutes, the waiter came to the table and apologized, saying that he had placed our order wrong and that our order would be out shortly. After about 20 minutes, I could see the cook cussing him out!!! When he brought our food to us, it looked like someone had thrown it together in a slop pot! The potatoes that came with the Pork Shank were burned black, my son's veal was cooked to a leather shoe consistency! I guess this is what happens when corporations take over, this was ridiculous! Sorry Macaroni grill, we will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to drop my review down a star. I stopped in for lunch on 12/23 and they have done away w/gluten free options which is such a terrible idea being that many people suffer from celiac or gluten allergies.  The waitress said they also removed the wheat pasta for those who are health conscious. I won't be returning for that reason alone and hope that corporate will rethink their choice for removing such items."}
{"text":"First have to say,  Ladies room was filthy. Should have been clean since it is only 11:30am and only 2 tables were seated. On a different note, Mother and I enjoyed the meatball appetizer. I ordered the Bibb and Bleu Salad. I would not recommend this salad. The flavors do not work together on your palette. Our server Jennifer went above and beyond. By the way, do not lay the white cloth napkins on your lap if wearing black. The lint residue sticks."}
{"text":"So the hubs decided he wanted some pasta for dinner, enter Macaroni Grill. We get there, get seated rather quickly, and were being taking care of by a newbie by the name of Stephanie. all was going pretty good at first. We got our drinks, we got our appetizers, plenty of bread and then it kinda went down hill. We waited, and waited and noticed that other tables around us that came in after us were already noshing on there food, so about say 45 min later my hubby was like hmmm yea ( not all that happy) He talks to the manager (who's name I am sad to say I do not remember but it was Saturday 03.29.14) and omg he was beyond generous. He comped our entire meal (apps, drinks, food) which was not even close to what we expected. We just wanted our food because we were hungry lol. 

My hubby loved, loved, loved his sausage and peppers and I loved my pasta di mare (with white sauce instead of red). Our waitress, Stephanie, was super apologetic and we weren't really that mad, just hungry ( even though we had bread and apps) Will we come back? Of course. This not my first time at this particular location (contrary to my check in) and it won't be my last."}
{"text":"I came here Saturday night with my sister and all her friends (a party of 10) for her bachelorette weekend. We had made a reservation for 7pm. When we got there, we noticed several tables outside and asked if we could sit there. After several minutes they said that they could not accommodate us on the patio because people were already seated and the tables were not together. Understandable. We waited probably 5-10 more minutes just to be seated. The restaurant was nearly empty. Our waitress was super friendly and got our drink orders taken very quickly. We waited a long time for bread, our meals, and for the checks. In total, it took us 2 hours to order, eat, and pay when the restaurant was not busy. I was a little frustrated at the wait, but the food was delicious and our waitress was great!"}
{"text":"Here from Charleston for the weekend with my husband and staying at the Marriott next door. This place was terrible. We are foodies and saw reviews to try it and it was so good. Well... service was terrible. It was not busy at all.. Mariah was our server and we saw her twice. The manager had to bring our salads.. after our entree was brought.. it was just wet lettuce on a plate with no dressing and some croutons. Mariah came back and put a hard as a rock loaf of bread on the table.. no knife or anything . I figured we are supposed to just tear it apart like animals... the table cloths are sheets of white paper that the server draws their name on like a kindergartner with crayon for us to remember I guess ... kinda silly for a restaurant that is not cheap and mostly adults... I had the chicken scallopini .. it was swimming in oil and butter and the lemon was so over powering I tasted nothing else.. I sat for 10 min waiting to see our server to send it back but we never saw her again til we had to leave.. 2 hours into our service. I ended up covering my food in black pepper and ate it anyways since it was late and we were ready to hear back to our hotel. Boy am I paying for it now.. my husband and myself have been throwing up all night and fire diarrhea.... yes we both got good poison.... I will be contacting them when they open but this is unacceptable. We did complain and was given our appetizer for free..."}
{"text":"Food and quality was fantastic! Alfredo was perfect. Management was awesome! The service from the waitress however was sorely lacking and very poor. With only 4 table occupied she looked as though she was slammed, making rare passes by our table, and ignored one part of the table or another each time she did grace us with an appearance,  which again was sparce at best. 

I sincerely hope that 3:00 on a Saturday is not just a bad time to go here if you want adequate service from the wait staff."}
{"text":"First off thanks Cathy for excellent, quick, friendly service.. You were great!

since I am a big kid I enjoyed the fact that the tables were covered with paper and crayons were already there waiting for me (yes me).

Now on to the food.
The bread they give you is delish. Its soft and yummy and the olive oil jug they leave you to refill your dipping plate is great. I just wish there was already parmesan cheese offered on the table.

We then ordered their 2 for $9 appetizers. We got the macaroni bites with truffle dip. Now think of a mozzarella sticks but filled with easy mac... This could be a great appetizer if they  made their own mac or used a different cheese. truffle dip was yummy.

we also got the baked Prosciutto & Mozzarella. It was a little crispy to be baked. It was pretty average. wouldn't order it again (assuming I ever go back).

Then I ordered the Lobster ravioli which had a very strong lobster taste. I was expecting it to be subtle with the taste of butter, but nope. If you like the strong in your face Lobster taste then go for it.

My husband ordered the Chicken Parmesan which was also very standard. The chicken didn't seem to be seasoned. Also the side of spaghetti (noodles in red sauce) was flavorless.

All in all we're never going back."}
{"text":"We have always loved Macaroni Grill in Winston and Greensboro.  We were visiting friends in Charlotte and chose Macaroni Grill to meet.  The restaurant was practically empty on a Sunday afternoon when we met.  The appetizers were great (baked prosciutto and mozzarella; zucchini fritti) but the service was mostly non-existent.  I was surprised  because the server didn't have a lot of distractions to consider (very few other customers).  The fettuccini alfredo was very dry (they forgot one order and rushed to make it).  The chicken under a brick was awesome and probably the only reason I gave 2 stars above.  Everything else (except the friends) was disappointing."}
{"text":"We've been there twice for dinner but won't go back. My chicken caesar salad was OK on the first visit, although their caesar dressing was very bland. Tonight I tried the chicken marsala -- which was absolutely terrible. Both the chicken and the pasta were cold. The pasta had absolutely no flavor, the marsala sauce was runny and the chicken breast was very small. The servers were nice enough both times, but apparently the restaurant has a new computer system that isn't intuitive or easy to use. Both times we were there the servers had to go back and forth several times to get the right coupons on the right check. The prices are just too high for crummy food and a long wait to settle the bill."}
{"text":"Thank you Lisa for taking good care of my mom & me while we soaked up happy hour.  The happy hour menu is delicious- warm feta,  Castelvetrano/kalamata olive medley with toasted bread turned out to be the perfect marriage with my canernet.
Who knew happy hour is 3pm- ???? Everyday! That is a smoking hot happy hour"}
{"text":"The only couple things that were good were the tea and the bread. 

The four of us ate for lunch and the food was barely warm. Two of us tried the butter squash tortellini. It was to have crispy prosciutto and it was soggy and the butternut squash was cut way to big. 

Another had the shrimp pasta.  It was very bland even after adding salt and pepper.

Will not return to this chain."}
{"text":"Yikes, what happened to Macaroni Grill?!?!?!? I used to love coming here. 

We did get seated right away but getting acknowledged by our server after being seated was another story. They seemed very busy. 

After quenching my thirst because I finally got my drink ordering was under way. I asked for a \"House Salad\" with extra ranch to start. Then for my meal I ordered the \"Build Your Own Pasta\". It was noodles, arrabbiata sauce and buffalo mozzarella. The server brought me a caesar salad instead if the house salad I ordered. Then brought the right salad after I was almost finished with my pasta. 

The food was good but service was lacking very much. 

It was clean inside and they just finished a remodel so they now have both booths and tables to sit at. 

They still have the curbside to go if you want to phone in an order to go.

Outside is a nice patio should you feel like eating outdoors."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Macaroni Grills years ago and I must say this one was the least memorable. . .  The bread took about 10 mins to come out and the food took about 30.  My spaghetti and meatballs (I was really craving meatballs) was not very good at all.  Pasta cooked correctly, but the \"meat sauce\" was greasy.  And the meatballs were reminiscent of frozen cocktail balls in my opinion.  At least as far as taste and texture.  I really wanted something more authentic, MUCH larger balls. . .  And this was not even close.  My mom got a steak that she snarfed down b/c she was starving.  My sister got a salmon dish that was, by far, the star of the show. I didn't get a taste of it - but it looked great and my sis said it was very good.  I wish I had ordered that!  But I wanted Italian food, helped suggest this place, and it was my experience that was the lamest.  I guess Macaroni Grill is not for me after going to enough authentic Italian places over the years."}
{"text":"I used to love coming in here, and hadn't been for a couple of years, so decided to stop in for lunch at around 1pm. We had to wait quite a bit for a table, as no one had bussed any of them. Ok, inconvenient, but it was only 10-15 min.

When our server came to the table for drink orders, she was pretty austere. No smiles, no chit chat. All business. She brought the drinks and bread. The bread, as always, was delicious. Crispy, flaky crust, and tender, soft inside. Love it. 

Salad came out next, and even though it was light on the dressing, the ingredients were all fresh and crisp.

I ordered the Chicken Scallopini, and my companion ordered the Hot Wing Chicken Parm (don't knock it). the chicken parm was huge, flavorful, and just a really fresh tasting well done dish.

The scallopini was a disaster. The chicken was cut into medallions, which were seriously overcooked. I mean, overcooked to the point that I couldn't cut it with my knife, and when I tried to bite into it, I thought I had bitten into straight up gristle. The artichoke hearts and mushrooms were not seasoned at all, the \"lemon sauce\" was just a puddle of oil that didn't even seem to have ever been in the same room with a lemon, and I think there were a whopping 3 capers sprinkled on top of the dish.

The really sad thing is that the server never once came back to check on us. When I finally was able to flag her down (after my companion had finished eating), she asked me if I needed a box (despite the fact that it was obvious my entree had been barely touched). In defense of the server, she did offer to have something else made, but I honestly didn't want to make my companion wait, since she had already finished eating, and I was tired of sitting there/

Not sure what happened to what was once my favorite dish, and main reason to visit. Only reason they get two stars is because the person dining with me got a great entree and was happy."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been in this particular Macaroni Grill. That's probably good since I was able to note the significant decline in the food and service.

I was there for lunch. Arrived at 12:45 pm. Slightly less than 50% occupancy in the dining room. My wife and I were seated immediately by the manager who was busy working the tables. As I was about to be seated in the booth, I noted the booth seat was covered in crumbs. The manager wiped it down remarking the busser didn't wipe it down (considering I hadn't seen a single busser, the manager was the one bussing tables).

I ordered the center cut lamb spedini and garden salad. The server asked if medium rare was okay since that's how it's normally served. I was fine with that. Salad arrived fairly promptly but I quickly noticed it was far from fresh. looked like bag salad about 3 days old. Wilted on the edges, limp and of generally unappetizing appearance. I sent it back without requiring a replacement.

Main course arrived and first cut revealed it was well done. I cut a few more. Well done too. Wait...I thought she said medium rare? Cool pink center remember? The server asked how it was and I told her not what was ordered. She returned it (kept the veggies to eat while new lamb was brought back). Replacement came out perfect and was juicy and tender. Previous was quite dry which led me to believe they're pre-cooking their meat, hence the well done as soon as it's heated up.

Manager never came to the table for either the salad or the lamb. in most places, the manager is required to authorize any reissue on plates. I would have been at the table in an instant to ensure I met the customer's concern/complaint. I think he was too busy making busy work. I noticed him walking around quite a bit but only sliding plates around in the kitchen window or placing salt and pepper shakers nicely. He was clueless and it showed in food quality and service. He was sweaty down the back of his shirt which may be fine for McDonalds, but not for a restaurant.

Years ago this was an ememplary dining establishment. Based on recent service I don't expect it to survive unless serious management is brought in."}
{"text":"We used to eat here so much they knew our names. Not anymore. The food, which i love when done properly, is old, dried out, and unappetizing. The service has sadly gone downhill too. I can almost always spot Poor management, and this is one of those cases. Save yourself the trouble & dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"terrific service, and the food was fantastic.   We had a bad experience next door (Landrys) and are thrilled that we could walk next door to Macaroni Grill.   Merry Christmas - And even though we were the last one in the restaurant, they didn't make us feel like we had to leave!"}
{"text":"So disappointed with our recent visit, first time and LAST TIME coming to this place. It started out nice with our server bringing out drink, took some waiting but didn't mind. After some time we notice we were not offered same treatment as other costumers in the restaurant. She brought refills and gave us water instead of regular drink, didn't complain. The chicken on our Chicken Alfredo pasta was almost like a ham texture, it was hard chewy, with a light pink color almost seemed raw to me. Also I didn't complain because I had made our service lady take it back because she brought only an alfredo pasta when I ordered a chicken pasta. Over all a mess, we are not people who like to be picky with our food but I had to put my review on this restaurant. Don't think we can Retry another Macaroni Grill. Once was enough for us and not coming back."}
{"text":"I too would give this place negative stars. Although the waitress was nice, the service was extremely slow. It probably took a good hour to get our food. Once I finally got it I had to send it back. They had smothered my spaghetti in red pepper flakes and one bite set my mouth on fire. I could swear they had to of done it on purpose as bad as it was. When I grabbed my tea to put out the fire I discovered my tea glass had been filled with diet coke. My grilled chicken was swimming in grease. The table next to us had to send their raw chicken back and the waiter argued and gave them dirty looks rest of the meal. To top it off the manager never came by to apologize."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the food.    Used to be a great place.   My steak was served COLD.  Not even the large pat of butter on top melted not even slightly!    
I was also disappointed that I was charged for the side salads but nut informed they were extra.   I should have asked but with the prices of the ribeye steak and salmon I assumed.   Learned my lesson!    Just because they ask what type of salad would you like doesn't mean it's part of your meal."}
{"text":"Food to go is the only way to go.....

Orders to go (I have placed over 5) are consistent, hot, correct, and will give you any extras requested.

In restaurant service?  We have actually arrived and left three times due to lack of service.  Exec leadership needs to mystery shop this location and provide feedback.

Orders to go get 4 stars."}
{"text":"First of all, I know this is a chain restaurant, so I am reviewing it for what it is. I just had dinner here tonight after a trip out of town.  I went by myself and the host didn't say the dreaded \"just one?\" when he seated me.  My server did, but I let it pass. I am not a regular here. I don't think I have ever been to this location before, and I think I have been to different locations maybe three or four times ever. 

I had a glass of  the house red, which is served in kind of a cool way. They leave a giant bottle at your table and you keep track of how many glasses you have. In my case, almost a whole one. 

Their bread is pretty good. I am not a huge fan of rosemary, but if you are, you'll love it.  They didn't give me any balsamic vinegar, just olive oil and I didn't care enough to ask.  

My server could have taken my order a little faster instead of schmoozing with the people at the next table, but it was not a long delay and she seemed to have a lot of tables other than mine. 

Their green salad is nothing special and next time I would probably get a caesar or skip the salad. It's not bad though. I had the chicken marsala for dinner. It comes with a mushroom sauce, soft cloves of roasted garlic and spaghetti that's tossed with chopped parsley. I think that is the only thing I have ever ordered here, and it was good. I am not a red sauce lover. 

I'm not sure if I came on a good night, because my experience was not consistent with the bad reviews that I have seen here. I would definitely go back for more of their house red and some appetizers.  The atmosphere is also very relaxed with nice music, mostly standards like Sinatra and Tony Bennett."}
{"text":"We go here ALL the time this trip the bartender was not as friendly or clean as I would like. Food was mediocre not like usual. This trip I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here at least once a week for almost 10 years; mostly for lunch, and sometimes just for an iced tea while I work on my laptop for an hour or two. This place is like my 'Cheers.' And most the staff know who I am, I seat myself and they know my \"the usual\"s. I usually sit on the bar area where Sandy, the bartender & shift manager takes good care of me. Joey, the GM usually makes his rounds to the tables to make sure everything is a-ok, which is really good. I like that personal touch. On the rare occasion something is not 100%, I'm not afraid to let them know and they always make it right in a jiffy.

Okay. Here are \"the usual\"s. 
1. The bread is a must, unless you are a no-carb Nazi. They give you a small plate of oil & vinegar on the side. Here's my tip: ask for a separate plate of their shredded cheese. Break the bread, dip it into the oil, and then into the shredded cheese. The cheese magically sticks to the bread and it's wonderfully even more delicious. I've been known to 'borrow' one of these magic cheese shredders and keep it at my table for the duration of my visit. I love the magic cheese shredder so much I bought one for home from Costco.
2. Lobster Ravioli. Lobster and ravioli we're just meant to be together. Make sure to tell them to sprinkle the cheese from the magic shredder on top so 'it looks like a snowy day.' 
3. The Bib & Bleu salad. I love Bleu cheese, so I always add extra Bleu cheese crumbles,  (You can never have enough Bleu cheese crumbles.) AND I always add 6 grilled shrimp. (4 is too few. 8 is too many, but 6 is juuuuust right!)
4. Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad. I always ask for extra .... Wait for it .... Cheese. LOL, they have large tasty shaves of parm cheese on top."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the overall score is so low but I have always loved macaroni grill and still do! The chicken parm is my favorite and it's amazing. Great cocktails, great bread, good atmosphere, and you can draw on the table! What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I can remember going to the Macaroni Grill soon after it arrived in the area.  Thought it was a bit classy for a chain restaurant, serving good food.  I now live where it is not convenient to go to one, so when I was visiting I decided to stop in.  Knowing that my tastes have changed, I did not know what to expect.  Gone are some of the old menu items and atmosphere.  The current menu has good variety and some interesting items.  The fried mac and cheese appetizer is the ultimate in comfort food. Mac and cheese deep fried, then dipped in cheese.  Light and healthy it is not.  Tasty it is.  The peppers stuffed with goat cheese are special -  peppers are sweet and complement the goat cheese.  Caesar salads are ok.  Entrees are good size.  Past is fresh and well prepared.  The mediterranean sea bass is flavorful and well prepared.  We did not have an opportunity to sample the dessert menu.  Service was a bit slow, but I think it was because the food was being prepared fresh.  All entrees arrived together and warm.  Overall, would recommend."}
{"text":"Wanted some comfort food with family and this place was just what we needed. Spaghetti, meatballs and bread for most of us, I did the make your own pasta dish, and everything was really, really good. They offered us a taste of chianti, we liked it, and then they left us the bottle for refills ON THE HONOR SYSTEM. 

What a breath of fresh air. Great food, great service (Sandy is very cool), and it's fun to watch the kitchen. A solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"i would never have gone here since i hate italian chain places but we were given a gift certificate. So here is the breakdown
Calamari- I could have fit the whole order in my hand. I was overdone and the worst i ever had.
-Eggplant Parm- Me wife had this and took three bites. She said it was under cooked and very bland. I tried a forkfull of the pasta that came with it. No taste at all
-Lasagna Bolognese. So - so. It was not that bad for a chain place but i would not go back for it
-Tapas meatballs. They were drowned in sauce and carmalized onion..apparently for a reason. to cover up their horrid taste.
 
The only chain place i would order pastas are Cheesecake Factory, they are all good there!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service and food. Dining at bar it's dirty and I feel invisible."}
{"text":"Horrible never coming back waited an hour for our food no reason"}
{"text":"The bread is pretty good. The Italian bake was too watery for my taste. The meat balls were decent and the sausage was ok. A fairly inexpensive meal and you get what you pay for. The crayons and paper tablecloth are a nice touch, nothing better than a paper cut at dinner."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, food was barely mediocre. The only reason I give this restaurant three stars is for the hostess. She was upbeat, friendly and could sing her heart out! Too bad our server was so bad. He was slow and forgot about us several times. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch with coworker! We ordered the zucchini fritti, pollo caprese and chicken spiedini. The zucchini was light and crisp and both chicken dishes were cooked perfectly. If you have gotten away from this location give it another try!"}
{"text":"Very poor food.  You could only taste garlic.  Paid the bill in cash and change wasn't returned.  Simply taken as a tip.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"The food merits 2 stars and the service was an absolute zero.

Side note: 20 years ago, this was perhaps the busiest restaurant in the Valley and had Brinker's then famous level of training and service.

The place looks about the same with faux Tuscan dinner house look and Italian lessons in the restrooms. Everything else has gone in the crapper.

We were there with a party of 10 to celebrate an anniversary at lunchtime. The place was virtually deserted (at 12:30p on a Sunday) and yet we were seated at the \"wrong\" table and reseated in the very back room.

Our server came huffing and puffing to greet us muttering and flustered that we were here (not sure why customers are seen as an inconvenience in such a slow place). He reluctantly brought water glasses and later brought some of the complimentary bread. Muttering about our being early (not true) instead of drawing of sappy sayings with crayons on the white craft paper that covers the tables. We were afraid to ask for ice from our water: we didn't want him to crack or go postal.

He brought out the house \"wine\", which is \"chianti\" from California. It is only one step up from Pompeii brand red wine vinegar.

Much later, he took our order. Each person was greeted with a terse \"next!\". Don't ask for changes or ask questions, please!

After another great span of time (in which we were left unattended, which in this case was better), the food came out. My Pasta Milano was only warm enough that I could eat it. I would have sent it back at a reasonable place. The \"garlic cream sauce\" was light on the garlic but completely overpowered by rosemary (which was not mentioned on the menu). A brave guest did send back their lukewarm pizza, which brought forth the scorn of the server.

The waiter did warm up when he heard one of the guests speak of real estate (but not addressed to the waiter). He began interjecting his opinion on mortgages and the real estate market. Wow! No interest in serving people, but a veritable talking head when it comes to residential real estate.

Anyhow, we were able to escape eventually, shaking our heads in disbelief."}
{"text":"not bad. Food is good. Service is good. Atmosphere is nice. Good spot to grab supper or maybe a lunch. They seem to have good lunch deals."}
{"text":"Today my wife and I needed somewhere to relax before shopping and a movie. We picked Macaroni Grill for the atmosphere, bread and amazing service. This location does not disappoint. They were very accommodating for a baby in a car seat. Stephon was our server and he was very nice and relaxed and put us at ease. I ordered the Ribeye and it was spectacular. I can't wait to go out on a day date again and come back to try something else. Love this location."}
{"text":"Came in during the lunch express hour and the menu for the Express plates were reasonable in price and quantity. If the food is not out in 7 minutes then the meal is on them. They fortunately for the meals out under the 7 minutes. My meal was delicious and the smaller portions for lunch are preferred when eating Italian food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our experience tonight was memorable ... not in a good way!  We ordered the wine & tapas.  Once our tapas were delivered, we ordered our dinners - to be eaten together.  Well, the kids' food came, then my son's, then mine ... 5 minutes passed & our server scanned the table, realizing my husband's food had not yet been delivered made a comment that he was going to \"check on it\".  He reappeared a few minutes later, looked @ our table & got this look on his face like he just remembered what he was supposed to do, disappeared then returned with my husband's dinner.  By now the kids were almost done with their food, my son & I had stopped eating so we could eat together.  My husband instructed the server to pack his up to go.  When our server returned with the to-go box, another persson was with him.  She didn't introduce herself but she kept apologizing (i figure she was the expeditor that didn't expedite).  Now if you're my husband and everyone else received their food and you had to wait, how upset would you be?  He turned down her offers of a free drink and dessert - she could've just comped  his meal but that didn't happen.  Our experience in the food industry is there is a 2-minute check after you've served your guests their food.  This was very, very disappointing, next step is to call corporate office"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lost hope in the Macaroni Grill until we came to this location. Not to sound dramatic, but in the three states we've lived in, only one other had a decent Macaroni Grill (CA).  The last one we ate at was located in WA and it was terrible.  We've been hesitant ever since.

Enter MG Strongsville.  We agreed to try again after the party we were meeting made the dinner suggestion sound so good.  It had been almost three years since our last experience, so we let them twist our arms.

We started with the bruschetta and spicy meatballs, which were small in portion size, but big in flavor.  Our entrees were the smoky shrimp flatbread, shrimp portofino, chicken fettucini, and something with red sauce that I can't remember because I was so taken with my shrimp and lemon butter sauce.  We ended our meal with vanilla gelato (topped with melted ghirardelli chocolate) and the chocolate chip cannoli.  

The only complaints I heard were that the fettucini needed more sauce, which our server (Don) happily obliged.  And, the flatbread was on the oily side, which wasn't my husband's favorite but I liked it.  Don did well to stuff us with bread and keep our drinks filled, plus he was pleasant and attentive.  Pretty much everything you would hope for in a server.

Thank you, MG Strongsville, for restoring our faith in your franchise."}
{"text":"There's no reason to go here, I dont think they even use garlic. It's like a chilies/Applebee's for Italian."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and the food was delicious. I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and it was very tasty. The restaurant also gives u delicious bread they make fresh and warm out the oven. Their portions are big very filling! Definitely coming back, staff is friendly :)"}
{"text":"So we have been here for an hour. The waitstaff is nice, it's not their fault that the kitchen seems desperately under staffed. We haven't seen our appetizers yet, the olives they gave us had a fingernail in it (ewww), my mothers salad was so wilted as to be inedible, and honestly the restaurant is almost empty so I don't comprehend what is taking them this long. A disappointing experience to be sure"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service in the bar area is awful. I watched on Christmas eve as the female bartender tried to pass off a bottle of straight vinegar to a customer next to me as being balsamic vinaigrette. When the lady asked if she could have oil for it, the server rolled her eyes & dropped a huge bottle of oil down in front of her and walked away. I left at that point and hoped for the best for the customer."}
{"text":"I gave two stars because our server was nice and we were seated immediately. The service was extremely slow. We had the Pasta Milano and the Chicken parmigiana. The Milano was bland with little sauce, so it was dry. The chicken parm was OK. They pound out the chicken so when they cook it, it becomes overcooked. There wasn't enough sauce. The roasted potatoes were pleasant, a little salty for my personal tastes. I just don't think its worth the money they charge."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, excellent customer service and to top it off they have the most honest manager I have ever met. April, I commend you for your honesty. She found my graduation card that had a  100 dollars in it in the parking lot and she returned it to me with all of it intact. Thank you April. I'm glad we picked your restaurant to celebrate my graduation."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my brother and my mom. We are all disappointed. We rather have spend the money at Tagliani down the street. The place had no more than 8 tables of customers. So you expect you would have more attention from your server. NOPE. My brother noticed the portion of the food was extremely smaller, but the prices are the same. Everything was just OK tasting. 

I do not think I will be back...due to the service and quantity of food you get."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Romano's Macaroni in and out of AZ.  The quantity and quality of the food has been decreasing over the years.  I am very bummed out about this.

During lunch, my brother and I ordered dinner portions.  When the food came out it was more like lunch portions.  1/2 a chicken breast for the chicken parm and a handful of noodles on a huge plate.  My pasta milano was 1/2 the portion from previous visits.

Our server was awesome, attentive our entire visit."}
{"text":"This our first and last visit here...
Spent an hour here.. waiting to be sat... waiting for bread.... waited half hour for my steak that i ordered med.. came out overcooked and cold!!! We left and went to Carrabas.. they gave us fantastic service and food!! Never going to Mac grill again...  go to Olive Garden first."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my son and husband we were very disappointed the food  took longer than expected to come to us,  we never got refills on our drinks the portions were small and it was expensive. The food we found to be average compared to what we paid. The worst was mine. I had the blackboard soup. Not very good. We won't go back."}
{"text":"I am really glad i didn't check this place on yelp first cause just by looking at the reviews i probably wouldn't have went. SO we went there today and i really liked it! I love the fact that the kitchen is open and its all just very cute. Just a nice looking place. I don't care for the bread they bring you. Too salty and too hard on the outside. We ordered the cheese loaded fries as a appetizer. For my taste it was not enough cheese and the bacon was a little too salty. I had the fettuccini Alfredo. DELICIOSO. I am super picky when it comes to Alfredo sauce but this was some good s***. Lol. I will for sure go back to try their grilled cheese and maybe check out their bar for happy hour. We paid 40$ for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and some raspberry tea (and someone had to get extra cheese on their pizza for 3.75$ ). Seth was our server and i cant complain.   I was too hungry to take pictures of the food. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"The portions! So big!!! Enough for 2 people. 

The bread! Freshly baked and warm... and moist and yummy! You need to ask for it if it doesn't come right away.

The apps are good. My favorite was the melted cheese... fuendo I think it was called. It was addicting!  Melted mozzarella cheese mixed in with other cheese. With bread to spread the cheese on. And they give you a lot of cheese... melted stringy goodness...

The main courses were huge! I had the chicken and mushroom cannelloni.  Very good. Little salty, but good.

I was so full I couldn't do dessert... and that doesn't happen very often..."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting food. Even the salads were watery and bland. How are they still in business?"}
{"text":"Food was slow and cold when it finally gets to you. Wait staff was slow to take drink and food order. Bread made it to the table 20 minutes after we sat down. Lunch for five adults from start to finish took 90 minutes and it was not very busy on a Thursday! I will not go back again."}
{"text":"A comedy of errors is the best description for our experience last night.  Our appetizer the mozzarella was over cooked and was more like potato chips, the bread was in short supply and took forever.  Our entrees took over an hour to arrive on our table.  To top it off, the waitress, didn't listen on how we wanted to split our bill and one of our party had to walk to her to coach her on how we wanted the check split.  Nothing hard either, split the bill, apply my $20 giftcard to my portion and bill me the balance.  While I don't blame the waitress for the slow service due to short staffing, I'm glad I don't come often.  Now I understand why.  For the money, there are plenty of other Italian choices.  Enough said."}
{"text":"I try to stay away from the chain joints because I always find myself writing mediocre reviews...and I hate writing mediocre reviews.  This was a work lunch so I had to attend.  Well, on to the review...restaurant from the outside seems clean and welcoming.  All of the stone work gives you the feeling of an Olive Garden.  Hostess greeted the group quickly and was ready to seat us.  1.00pm on a Thursday must not be a popular time.  

We were quickly escorted to our table and I immediately noticed bags of rags(kitchen or waiter rags) scattered across one of the dining tables.  I have to say...I am glad we were not seated at that table.  I am making the assumption they were clean.  I sure do hope so because they could have just been sitting on our table prior to our arrival.  Not a great presentation of the dining area.  Waitress came by, wish I had got her name, but she was very..what's the word I am looking for?  Maybe invasive, like a bull in a china shop?  I have never been reached over so much in my life without an excuse me or pardon me.  Apparently, drink orders, appetizers, and entrees are written in crayon on the paper tablecloth in front of me.  Not really my favorite way of taking an order but...just my opinion.  

Had a warm spinach salad with shrimp.  Hmmm, I know it's lunch and everything, but 5 overcooked frozen shrimp?  Tough, clearly overcooked, and just downright horrible.  I think I would have had better luck buying frozen at the grocery store.  I rarely complain anymore because its just not worth it and I don't have the time.  Will not be visiting again.  I hope others have a better experience with different entrees."}
{"text":"Looks good from the outside, but inside...service...NOT GOOD!  The food was substandard, dry chicken and for the price, not worth it.  I took my brother to dinner after a movie to Romano's and I should have just hit the Fat Burger or Texas Roadhouse next door.  First, the server Kelsi, was new or maybe it just felt she was new.  My brother had ordered tea with his meal, we were sitting there drinking, when my nephew looked at my brother's glass and said, \"What is that?\"  We looked at the glass and noticed this GLOB of multicolored brown substance running down the inside of the glass from the lip of the glass to the bottom (the bottom looked like a big glob of white stuff).  We all stated, \"Gross\" at the same time.  The reason it took us a while to noticed it was due to the lighting in there, it's dark...now I know why...dishes are not so clean. 

We brought it to the attention of another server, we had no idea where our server went.  He stated the same thing we did, \"Gross,\" and told us he was sorry. Our waitress came over and brought my brother another glass of tea, and said, \"Sorry.\"  She didn't tell us what was in the glass (again we couldn't see), I would have liked to know because I brother ACTUALLY drank out of the glass but low and behold, she never came back after dropping off the glass.  It's was like we did something wrong and we were being punished...seriously never saw her again, just dropped the check off.  We didn't get served water again, were not checked on, it was pretty sad. 

My sister had a pasta dish,I think the Chicken Milano that she liked, but my chicken skewers had some dry chicken on it, my brother had the half chicken that was dry but still good he said.  Remember, we didn't get visited again until the check, our server didn't even serve our food, we had it come out in three different sessions.  It was ridiculous, dry food without water...BAH!

Anyway, after all this, I paid the bill, and thought, nope...need to talk to the manager.  I did, young man, stated, \"Well, I wasn't told about this.\"  And that was it.  Nothing else, no, \"I'm sorry\" \"Yeah,she should have taken care of it and helped you out,\" \"Oh sorry, your waitress should not have abandoned you.\"  NOTHING at all.  As a matter of fact, I felt uncomfortable when he made his big grandiose six word statement to me, that I said, \"Well, I thought you should know,\" and walked away.  THEN, THEN...to add insult to injury, I wasn't paying attention to the bill, so focused on my brother's enjoyment, that I didn't see...THEY CHARGED US FOR THE TEA!  Seriously, who does that?!  

You take your chances here.  Make sure you check out your silverware, glass, etc., I might suggest you bring a flashlight since it appears intentional that they keep the lighting low.  Don't want you to see what you are actually getting I guess.

For the price, the quality of food, the quality of service...it's not worth it. Go to Olive Garden, spend less money, they cannot mess up the salad too bad.

Wait, sorry...forgot to say I went on their website because I was so upset...I got NO, NO response.  Pretty pathetic!"}
{"text":"First off good bread and good food. Much better quality than olive garden or others in the same market. However the service is good and nice but very slow. I found out a secret though the $9 9 minute menu it came out fast actually too fast my friend ordered a full meal and I was served and done before he finished his salad. I ordered the Pesto bow tie chicken pasta. Very good the bread and Ice tea are great as well. I give it a 4 based on value but really deserves a 3 star because of  the service."}
{"text":"Ok I'll be honest. Only good things about this place? The paper on the tables and the bread. Their food has always been inconsistent with me and my family. I love the bread at the beginning as it's a good thing to have if the food takes to long, and me being an artist and having the table with paper on it in front of me is probably the greatest thing I've ever seen.
I just can't give them a good rating since their food and service is always on the bad side."}
{"text":"Wife and I enjoyed our Sunday lunch. Food was excellent, and service outstanding, but there were few patrons as we arrived shortly after noon. I had not eaten in a Macaroni Grill in over 20 years and was pleasantly surprised. The facility is a step above Carrabba's and 2 above Olive Garden. But the woodwork could definitely use a good dusting."}
{"text":"I usually don't like chains but this one is better than the last time I was there. I think that they have changed managers.

The last two times we went the service was fast and friendly.

The lunch specials have been excellent both times, and the bread is very good."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter had the day off today so we decided to try this place for lunch. What a waste of time and money! Waited at the front to be seated but nobody came and stood there with what little people were there looking at us, (should have left then). We sat ourselves and a waitress came and we told her it was our first time there and she took our drink order and brought them, I asked about their seven minute lunches and she just said if we wanted to eat those wed have to go to the counter and order and pay there, and left. My daughter s tea tasted fermented or rotten (was an Arnold Palmer), my lemonade was very watered down, for 3.00 each? I ordered a chicken parmesan sandwich and she ordered tortellini. That is exactly what you get, no side salad, nothing, a boring meal. The chicken sandwich at Burger King is comparable but at 2 for 5 can't complain about Burger King. The tortellini wasn't much better than from a frozen meal. It took the guy 10 minutes to bring to us and I mentioned it, he said, well it's 7 minutes from the time i put the order in to the time they sit it on the counter. Really?What good does it do me on the counter? But then what do you expect in 7 minutes? Another red flag. Everyone was running around like chicken with heads cut off and the place was hardly busy. Nobody ever asked us if we needed anything after we got the food,guess if you don't order from the regular menu you're not getting service or acknowledged. we took 10 minutes to eat, I wrapped the other half of the sandwich in some brown paper they line the plates with and I almost ran out. Needless to say, no tip was left, I mean for who? For what? Felt awkward the entire time, like twilight zone, like nobody could see us sitting there. Very strange experience. Every time someone else came in they also had to wait because there was nobody up there, so they stood there looking awkward. Why is this place even open? They need to go eat at Oreganos and get some tips on everything."}
{"text":"This place is very easy to find: next to On the Border. These two restaurants are the ones that stand out the most in the Promenade. 
The food is always good. I've been here a number of times for both lunch and dinner. The free bread is DELICIOUS. One of my favorite free breads. It's nice and hot, and you dip it in the olive oil. Entrees are great. The cream sodas aren't that great, because they come out in tall glasses and when you get to the bottom of it, you're just sipping cream through the straw because there's no more soda. 
Besides that, everything else is great. The service is very attentive, interior is very cozy and dimly lit, and drawing on the table (covered in paper tablecloth) with crayons is always fun. Not a bad place to go regularly for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Actually walked out of this restaurant after waiting 20 minutes and no servers had even acknowledge we had been seated, and the restaurant wasn't busy at all!  A first for both me and my husband!"}
{"text":"Horrible service had to wait 15 mins for anyone to see us . Went to a manager he forgot extra dressing , water etc . Waitress took drinks away and never brought refills then laughed about it when asked . This place needs to close down ."}
{"text":"Coming in here for lunch made me a little nervous about the veganizability, however, this is where a good server is separated from a bad server.  My server was amazing!

It was a beautiful day and nobody was sitting outside so our server let us sit on the patio and take care of us while managing her other tables inside.  That's when I knew we were in good hands.

After looking over the menu, there really wasn't anything vegan or even close, so I asked my server to put together some sort of veganized option for me.  She came out with a spinach salad, roasted asparagus, brocolettes, and pine nuts.  Perfect lunch combo with the fresh spinach, smoky flavored veggies and salty pine nuts.  All of it washed down with an iced tea in my glass that never went without a refill.

This may be a new lunch destination next time I am in town!  Thank you for not letting me down!"}
{"text":"Worst corporate dining experience ever. We don't have one near us, nor do I want one! Stopped for a non fast food lunch today in strongsville. Staff was horrible. Food ok."}
{"text":"Brought the family here for my son's 20th birthday. We were seated very fast.  We had  a party of eight and they had us seated at two small tables. After adding the other table we had room to sit.
The  server was a little slow and seemed upset she had a large table. 
The food came out i had the chicken under a brick. The chicken was about as tender as a leather shoe, way over cooked. The potatoes were refrigerator warm meaning they were cold. 
Overall the food is over priced and not good.
Will not come back here especially since oregano opened down the road."}
{"text":"too much salt- house wine is poor- they are close to being good- a little more effort please
the sole was previously frozen and prepped off site ( or made very poorly) very mushy. It had the tast of a commerically made dish- soggy and old.
Lay off the salt- make more of an effort on the white fish"}
{"text":"Customer service sucks from staff to on duty manager!
Told 3 times Will be right with you as we waited 10 mins to be seated in a almost empty restaurant.
Everyone seem more concerned with cleaning up and closing than making the customer feel welcomed.
If fact we felt like an annoyance.
We had to find a manager just to get a server to come to our table 10 mins later. That server only came to our table twice the whole time as she was busy with \"a large party.\"
Place is under staffed"}
{"text":"Used to love Macaroni Grill but after this visit will probably not return.  Took 15 minutes after being seated before waitress even came to introduce herself.   Food was just ok.  Lasagna was dry.  Son ordered Fettuccini Aldredo  and as he was eating it he found white chunks of something in it.  I thought originally it was large pieces of parmesan cheese, but after looking closer and tasting it it was definitely not cheese.  Almost like chucks of some kind of vegetable.  Ask waitress and she also could not identify it.  Pretty scary!  
Also I believe they have raised their prices.  A pasta meal which used to be $10-11 dollars, is now $15.  Not much on the menu for under $15 these days.  Will probably never return.  Much better Italian restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"I think the ratings are harsh for Romano's Macaroni Grill! This particular location is clean and efficient and the cost of a good Italian dinner is so low that any shortcomings it may have are overcome by the value of it all.  Cheer up Yelpers, this restaurant is better than its rating!"}
{"text":"It's a Macaroni Grill... not much to say about this... if you have gone to one, you have seen them all. Nothing is really memorable. Including the service. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"My Mother ordered the 1/2 chicken that is cooked with a brick and roasted, it was as hard as a brick & only a 1/4 of chicken, all of our previous visits it was good. When the server asked she finally mentioned it, she offered to have it redone at that point she was frustrated & will not return, for a $20 chicken entree that should not have been plated and served."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, and never eaten at this restaurant before. Staff was friendly and food was great. Would recommend to everyone I know visiting Vegas/Henderson!"}
{"text":"Date night. Noticed that for a Saturday night the place was dead. The waiters were all over the place unorganized, menus were filthy, tables are dirty. Food was disgusting so much it gave my man the shits. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix with some teammates for a competition, we all decided to go out to dinner together.  Everyone agreed on Italian, so we started calling around looking for a table.  Fun fact: finding a table for twelve people ninety minutes before you want to eat on a Friday night, should probably not be Plan A.  Fortunately for us, Macaroni Grill was more than happy to hold a table for us, provide excellent and attentive service, serve us yummy food, and even split the check.  We're in Phoenix around this time many years, and will definitely consider coming back next year."}
{"text":"If you love Olive Garden, then this place's food is going to make you think you're eating fancy.  Otherwise, it's the usual chain food experience that's happens to be a bit better than most.

Be warned, I grade chain joints different from from-scratch restaurants.  Olive Garden would be a 1 star with things like pre-cooked cryovac'd bags of short ribs and overwhelming use of high-sodium prepared goods, and a high rating would be something like J. Alexander's.  With that in mind, I give Macaroni Grill three stars.  

Yes, they don't make their sauce fresh in house, but the food is generally much better than other chain Italian joints, including Maggiano's Little Italy, which is owned by the same parent company.  There certainly exists much better chain Italian restaurants, but Macaroni Grill has so many locations it's just easy to get to.  This particular location is just fine as far as I'm concerned.  Overall, it beats the hell out of Applebees, Friday's, Chili's, and Olive Garden.  

I find it best to go on Thursday's when it's half off wine night.  While it's not a wine lover's paradise, there's usually something pretty decent you can get for $12 to $15.  That's great.  I also find the custom pasta bowls provide a cheap and good means to fill a craving.  

My only real menu complaint, and I'm giving it a lot of leeway given that it's a chain joint, is the complete lack of creativity in the entree department.  It contains all the usual staples, generally covered in some sort of sauce, and served with a side of pasta.  It's boring.  Thankfully,  you can sub out the pasta for other items and ask that they integrate those items into the dish (just ask and they'll do it).  I was able to turn the chicken scallopini into something really awesome with just a couple tweaks that no one seemed to mind doing for me.  I don't know if this is generally allowed at this location or any other location, but I've gotten away with it a few times.  Most chain restaurants at this level do not dare stray from the corporate recopies.  

The deserts at Macaroni Grill just don't do it for me.  The canolis don't taste or feel right at all, and everything else is just the usual over-indulgent (over filling) deserts that do more to fill a major sweet tooth than to provide a good meal-ending. 

Service is fine at this location. It's not fine-dining service, but it's friendly and it gets the job done just fine.  

Overall, I don't generally consider a restaurant like Macaroni Grill when I'm thinking of going out to eat, but if I'm having to choose amongst the mall-class of chain restaurants, Macaroni Grill generally wins."}
{"text":"Arrived at 12:48pm sat in the bar which is usually where we eat at Macaronis no service for ten minutes with only one other table in bar so moved to regular dining room,  immediately got seated and took our drink order, asked if we would like some bread.  She returned 5 minutes later with wine and water we never did see the bread.  There were only 4 tables in restaurant and 2 servers so you would think service would be excellent...... well 40 minutes later she brings the salads to our table and then 4 minutes after that the main entrée, so we didn't have time to eat our salad,  food was good and when we finally got the bread it was not fresh at all.  This is the second time we have had this experience at this restaurant and it will be the last.  This place needs some new management."}
{"text":"I love going to Macaroni Grill for special events, holidays, or if I just want really good pasta. Usually there is a wait, but it goes by pretty quick, plus I think they do call ahead seating. 

I love the pasta milano, but I recently found out they got rid of the bow tie pasta and replaced it with some other kind of noodle, and boy it just wasn't the same. My waitress didn't even tell me until after I got my order. 

I do not recommend take out orders from this place. The portions are smaller, and I my order was wrong the one time. So stick with dine in at North Olmsted. They did however, put my name on a list so I could have a complimentary entree next time I came in, which is exactly what I did. I was happier ( even with no bow ties :() 

I've had so many good experiences here, and I will continue to go get my Pasta Milano!"}
{"text":"Well, where do I start out?! Let's start out with the fact that I called to place a phone order, got all the way there from BOULDER CITY & was told, \"they didn't have the ingredients to make my food.\"
Conveniently enough, the lady got my phone number wrong when she took my order so it was a complete WASTE of time!!!

I called the \"manager\" Ryan & he said there was nothing he could do. I am astonished that he could not even compensate for me driving all the way there. Well thank you sir for wasting gas in a truck to drive all the way down here for nothing. 

I am beyond frustrated with this restaurant, you will no longer have my business & it's pretty sad cause we came in once a week. 

I'll be sure to let corporate know that they could use a better manager."}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill use to be a really good restaurant. It's not like it's the worst place in town, but the bread that use to be awesome was dry and cold!  When our tea was refilled, there was no ice, and they didn't ask if we wanted Parmesan cheese on our entree, and the waitress had a hard time managing two tables. Hope this isn't the way all the Macaroni Grills are going to be from now on. 

There wasn't that many people in the dining room, and there was no sense of urgency to help the guests, they really need to work on their guest service!"}
{"text":"Never, ever going back. Horrible, rude service.  Other great options in the area."}
{"text":"Usually an O.K. place.  I was served the steak salad with clearly yellowed arugula.   Waited quite a bit for food so I just picked out 1/3 of the greans that were old.  Not very generous with them.  They could have substituted them for something else.  I didnt want to wait for another salad.the first on took long enough.  No other discount or anything was offered."}
{"text":"Years ago when Romano's Macaroni Grill came out, the food was pretty exceptional. I ordered the Alfredo with chicken from the lunch menu. Wow, what a SMALL dish for the cost. The chicken tasted like it was from a microwave reheat bag, all rubbery and lacking any flavor. My overall feeling about this meal, is I could get about the same thing from the freezer section of my local grocery store for a significant savings, and the taste would have been the same. I was not impressed with the flavor at all. I'm giving two stars as I did also order a dessert, which was pretty good. Again though, the cost of the dessert was high in relation to qualify. The restaurant was pretty empty for lunch, which makes me curious if others in the Desert Ridge area have caught on that this place is a subpar brand. The table cloths were dirty, they put our group into this U shape setting, which actually split the two sides apart. The server was nice, yet left alone to attend to such a large group, and she struggled a bit, which isn't her fault, I think this is a management issue, didn't even see a manager during the visit. This place is off the list of places we will go again. Everyone else made comments that the food was about two star quality. To Romano's: Get back into the competition and make fresh food. Go back to your beginning and do it right again."}
{"text":"Well...that was weird.  Macaroni Grill used to be one my favorite places to go, but I haven't been in years, but   today, we happened by this one and stopped in for lunch.  Our server was...odd.  He told us many times it was his first day, but when we had questions about menu items, he would not find out the answers, but instead made up his own, wrong answers, like saying aribiatta was a thick pasta and not a sauce.  He was also quite annoyed when we changed our mind when ordering.  

The Rosemary bread was hard as a rock and obviously left over the night before, just given a coat of hot butter before serving.  And our caprese salad was just tomato and basil.  No dressing.  Luckily we had olive oil, balsamic and salt on our table so we could dress it ourself.  

I felt there was a general lack of organization going on.  Not a great dining experience.  :("}
{"text":"We went for lunch and had the worst experience. Our service was incredibly slow. The food took 40 minutes to arrive at our table. The drinks were rarely refilled. Our server did not come and give us an update about the food and when our food arrived, it was luke warm. The food was ok at best. I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: As a former long-time restaurant server, I can put up with a lot when it comes to eating out somewhere... But this was too much! 
I went here with some co-workers after work on a Monday night at 5. Place looked like a ghost-town, but that just means better service, right? Wrong! Our server never asked us what we wanted to drink, even after we had been sitting there 20 minutes. All he said was, \"You guys want some calamari?\". They were out of it anyways, even if we wanted it.  We ordered and he didn't write it down, and messed it up when he tried to recall what we all ordered. Didn't ask if we wanted any soup or salads. I had to ask for one, after he had already put in the order and everyone else wanted one too (he almost missed out on $15 more in sales!). He brought out one cold little bread loaf for the 6 of us. We had to ask for bread and drink refills constantly. Our food arrived so much later, and the restaurant was still empty! Everything was cold, and the guy looked offended when we asked for him to heat it up. The plates came back to us 15 min later with half the amount of food on them than when we sent it back!  We each ordered different desserts to share and they all had that 'frozen' taste to them. This guy definitely didn't want to be there and shouldn't.  Should have gone to Famous Dave's across the street like we had initially planned. At least they are friendly there, and I can overlook bad food if I have a great server!"}
{"text":"I have been to several different Romano's locations and I was very upset with my recent experience at this location. When we first walked in it smelled like sewer. It was disgusting. So we opted to sit outside as it was really nice out. Our sever was slow and kept forgetting things and then our food came out cold! That was not cool, especially considering they were very slow at that time. It was just a bad experience and I will avoid this location in the future."}
{"text":"When you actually go into the restaurant it's nice! Nice setting update classy etc etc. it's a nice spot for a simple date night. 

Now I usually do the To Go orders so this was my first time actually eating inside the place. The staff is very friendly and nice. They leave you a big bottle of water so that you can help yourself but they take care of your other refreshments. 

I got the usual Chicken Parm (I like spicy food so I got them to kick it up a bit) when the food finally came and I started eating it was like eating plain chicken. Even though the chicken was coated and backed and looked seasoned it was just rough. It had no flavor whatsoever. 

Now this is confusing because when I usually get the To Go it's usually pretty awesome! But inside the food just didn't hit it for me. It was a complete miss. Even my wife thought her Fettuccine was bland. 

I'm not sure what happened but I'm probably going to stick with the To Go orders here.

The staff was 5 stars but the food was mediocre at best. Maybe they were having an off don't but I just don't know."}
{"text":"A friend of mine invited us to dinner here.  It's been a while since we've been to Macaroni Grill.  We use to eat at a Macaroni Grill for lunch all the time, but in recent years have ignored it.

I have a favorite dish....the Pasta Milano (Roasted Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Farfalle Pasta in a roasted Garlic Cream Sauce, $11.99).....but I got it without Chicken since I'm on a no Meat diet.

The Better Half ordered the Crusted Sole (Filet of Sole topped w/Lemon Butter & served w/Sun-Dried Tomato, Spinach Orzo, $14.99).

I didn't like my Pasta Milano.....the Cream Sauce was very watery and didn't have much flavor....bland, which has never happened to me when I've ordered it.

The Better Half enjoyed her Sole, but didn't think it was anything beyond average.

My friend ordered the King Salmon ($17.99) and enjoyed it.

If I was rating this dinner on my experience alone, it would have been 2 Stars....but since the other two dining with me enjoyed their meal, I'm bumping it up to 3.  The service was so/so.....young wait staff here with plenty to learn about service....I didn't ding them because of their inexperience.  They were pleasant and sincere....which goes a long way with me.

{"text":"I really don't want to spend too much time writing a review on this chain restaurant because well, most people who dine here are probably aren't reading reviews before they dine here.

I actually was invited to go to this restaurant to celebrate a birthday so I couldn't say \"no\" or show that I'm such a food snob. At first, our server was friendly and attentive but as the night continued, he was hard to find and he would forget to deliver items (a glass of wine, my tea, an entree, etc). We had to remind him a few times. 

We ordered the fried mac and cheese and portobello fries for the table. The portobello fries were hard and dry and the Mac and cheese was okay. Hubby and I ordered the Mama's trio: lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo, and something else. Do I remember? Hell no - because i tried one bite of all three and I only liked the fettuccine alfredo. When I say \"I only liked\", I mean \"I only would eat\".

Overall, meh. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Look. You know what you're going to get at Macaroni Grill. I'm not going to ding a place just because it happens to be a mega-chain restaurant. It's your fault if you go to the Macaroni Grill expecting home-cooked Italian food. They do the standards well and have a few signature dishes that I enjoy. In addition, you may substitute rice pasta for any of the pasta dishes, so that's a plus. Like many things in life, if you go in with the proper expectations, you won't be disappointed at the Macaroni Grill. Also, how can you not love a place that let's you pour your own wine?"}
{"text":"Horrible meal. Look for yourself. Burned bread and chicken parmigiano. I contacted Macaroni Grill corporate  - no reply or apologies."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very nice. The restaurant wasn't very busy so I have a hard time understanding how the service was so slow. I mean it took at least 45 minutes to get our bread and another 20 minutes to get the stuff to dip the bread in. All of this would have been fine. We had a large party so I am lenient about the slow service. The worst thing that will 100% keep me from returning was the water. It tasted like toilet water. That is no exaggeration. It was so gross. We asked about it and hat said that is just how it is. We are a water family. We don't go out and buy drinks. If I can't have water with my meal, I won't be back. Plus I imagine they cook with this water so that is also gross."}
{"text":"Customer Service is always great, I get lunch here to go often. My order is always correct and ready when I arrive. They always put in extra silverware which is nice."}
{"text":"the bib and blue salad is to die for! I cannot go here without getting it. also the chicken marsala is my favorite entree, it is even big enough that me and my grandma get a salad each and just split the marsala. The drinks are few and in between unless you like wine. and if you want good service do NOT sit in the bar area, the servers were slow even though it wasn't busy. I go here atleast once a month though and sit in the dining area."}
{"text":"Pretty solid lunch place. I am not big into chains, but at least you know what you are getting when you go. I got the parmesan-crusted chicken salad and ate every bite. Had I been eating carbs, I would have also scarfed down the complimentary bread and olive oil, along with an order of mac and cheese bites with truffle sauce. I'm also a big fan of the caprese salad."}
{"text":"Well, I like it because it's quiet.  Not a lot of hubbub.  Ate at the bar, but when bartenders changed shifts, the bar was unattended and we were ignored.  Food was just ok.  Don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give it 1 star. Don't be fooled by the advertisement of the lunch express order being ready in 7 minutes.  I couldn't even place my order by phone because of the almost 10 min hold time. When I arrived to place the order in person, I was greeted with an unsolicited apology by a manager...then, the only person available, srarted taking phone orders. The chaos in the kitchen was palpable, disgruntled patrons obvious and the kitchen score of 90 made it an easy choice to not consider Macaroni Grill ever again."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my bf. We were not disappointed! We ordered the 2 for $9.49 appetizers which was a great deal. You also get complimentary bread and olive oil & fresh pepper so that was a great touch! Our waiter Lamar was very nice and helpful when it came to making our order. He gave us some suggestions to consider and was very knowledgeable about the food. He even brought us complimentary Caesar salads! Our main course meal was absolutely delicious! I got the folded ravioli pomodoro. Will def come back again!"}
{"text":"I remember this restaurant being a great lunch and dinner place.... Went there for lunch today, only two other tables were occupied.  This should have been a red flag since it was 1230 lunch hour.... We were seated right away and after that our server who seemed to be the Manager was non existent.  We finally got our lunch and it looked as if the ravioli had been sitting for a while.  Overall the people were friendly but we decided we will not ever be coming back.  Too expensive for poor service and old food :-("}
{"text":"While I love Macaroni Grill I cannot let Bad Food and Service go un-noted.

I guess thats what happens somtimes in big chain type restaurants

The story is this...

I visited my Mom at work one Friday just as she was about to close...She left work and my girlfirend and I asked if she wanted to go to dinner.

I suggested Macaroni Grill and I LOVE the bread and oil here...It was about 5:40pm when we entered the restaurant just before things started getting busy.

We came in...were seated.....Our drink orders were taken quickly, and the lovely delicious bread was brough out quickly.

A few minutes went by and our drinks still were not brought out.

Eventually drinks were brought out and orders were placed...
I ordered the Italian Sausage Spiedini, My GF ordered Shrimp Portofino, & my Mom ordered Chicken Cannelloni

We placed our orders and talked about the weeks events.  We started to notice the restaraunt was getting busier and our food was not out yet...

We talked more and soon our drinks ran out.  No dinner yet.  It is now about 6:20.  We asked for waitress, and she refreshed our drinks, said dinners would be out soon.  

Ten minutes pass and we are hungry and wondering whats going on, we look to our sides and notice a big plate coming out....NOT OURS. hah...shorly there after our plates arrive and we are warned they are hot...

Our drinks are gone again and nothing has been refreshed.

I start to eat and our drinks get refreshed.  The first Link I had I just ate with my fingers...until I burned them, the waitress wasnt kidding it was hot!  The next link I pick off and slice open....nice and PINK, i.e. RAW.

My stomach immediately was weak.  

nearly 40 minutes wait time and my food comes out raw? No way, I ask my Mom and girlfriend to confirm and check their own food.

Mom's was good.   GF was expecting more pine nuts as shes been having that dish for months.

We finish our drinks again.  Waitress comes by to ask about food, I ask for the Manager kinda abrputly due to poor drink service and raw pork after 40 minutes...

Manager comes out and before I get to say anything he interjects \"before you even say anything I see that your meat is pink\"  Now while that might be seen as proactive, it was also a bit rude as there are multiple issues at hand.

So I says thats correct however also where are the pine nuts in the portofino and drink service is minimum.

He goes on to say there is a shortage of pine-nuts and he apologizes for drink service.

I tell him I am not interested in the plate being replaced, he comes back saying hes going to cover the \"dinner selections\" .  I thank him and he says not to thank him as dinner was not properly prepared and service less than exception, he hands me his card and tells me to call him if there are any medical problems.

So, we get the bill for $10.00 and the at first I was ok with this but then the more I thought about it, what a cheap skate!  The restaraunt was REALLY BUSY by the time we left and you cannot tell me that as a common courtesy he shouldve comped the whole meal.

So I went home, had an upset stomach, filled out the Macaroni Grill Survey with low marks, left my number to be called and no response.

After that experience, I dont really care how good the bread is, I will make it myself! and I will not be going back to a Macaroni Grill at any time.  I cant believe no one called me.

Just poor poor poor service"}
{"text":"I choose to go here when I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for a family meal but still want some civility to my meal. It's sometimes really loud here but a clean atmosphere. I do enjoy when the weather is cool enough to enjoy the fireplace. If you join their mailing list they constantly have great meal deals to save some cash."}
{"text":"This is our second trip here in 6monts and this place has gone downhill bad in the last year. First off the service was horrendous and the food not that good. I don't know if it is new management or what but we used to enjoy coming here, never again. At least not the one at Desert Ridge. So we were seated promptly which was probably the only good thing and I should have known considering the restaurant was half empty on a Saturday night at 6pm. Well after we were seated it took almost 20min for our waiter to show up. After that I started to time things because I had a bad feeling it was going to be a bad experience. We were a pretty large group 8 of us out to celebrate  Easter. Will after our drink order was taken it took almost 15min to get our drinks and get our order. I am pretty sure our waiter was high as a kite based upon the way he was acting. Real jerky movements didn't seem to know where he was half the time it was bad. which Ill get to more in a minute. So once we got our drinks and ordered salads etc. It took another 27minutes for our salads to show  and no waiter ins sight the entire time along with my 3 year olds dinner which was a piece of charcoal chicken. When the waiter came and  brought our salads he also knocked my wife's Coach purse off the chair and onto the nasty floor. He stopped looked at it for almost 10 seconds and then mumbled to himself and continued to hand us the salads. He asked if wanted pepper or cheese then walked off didn't even ask to pick my wife's purse. So about 1 min later he came back and asked us if we wanted pepper or cheese ....again. Well we said you already asked us and we said no. He had a confused look on his face and walked off. No Joke 2min later he comes back AGAIN and asks again, at this point I don't know if he's just being a jerk or truly doesn't know he asked 2 other times. Also this entire time we have empty glasses. Finally another waiter came over and filled our drinks for us. So after about 20 more minutes, Our food comes, by this time we are all starving and I was wondering why they brought out my daughters food so  early as it was now cold. Well the food was ok, I got the chicken Caccatorie and it was eh so-so. The chicken was like chewing a piece of rubber. Needless to say the waiter didn't get a very good tip and I will not be going to this particular Macaroni Grill again....Ever. I now the reason this place was half empty on a Saturday night. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"Came here for their BUY 1 express dinner ($9) & GET 1 FREE special. Super deals. I ordered one of their specialty buffalo pasta and my friend got a beef rotini. You go to the front and order yourself and once seated you basically get the food to your table and that's all, since it's express dinner I guess you don't get service. Which sucks bad when we are dying of thirst and all the servers were busy. So we kind of just chow down our food so we could leave and get drinks elsewhere. The food wasn't good, I didn't like my pasta at all, the sauce was way too salty for my tastebuds. However I did enjoy the crusted chicken, yum yum. I wont be coming back, I rather go to Olive Garden for my Italian cravings."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Romanos macaroni Grill this evening and it was perfect. The server was great and and the food was incredible. would highjy suggest macaroni grill for a nice dining expierience Five Stars all the way Thanks David"}
{"text":"Noone ever expects much from chain restaurants and I say we really should. Hey, chain monsters do expect us to pay $20 per entrée, shouldn't we expect for the entrée to be delightful in return?
Plus they get inspected more often and their garbage is always promisingly full with all of the yesterday's produce. Hopefully Macaroni Grill is that kind of a place. I didn't check their garbage or kitchen but food was ok. They have this $15 lunch special which you can totally split and drown in 2 liters of remarkably bad cheap wine ( they should serve it with a side of Tylenol; splitting headache will eat your brains away seconds after the first sip).
Service was rather mediocre though, losing interest in us once we said we are going to split the lunch special. But hello, how do you expect me to fit in my new years dress after all the greasy discounted fettuccini? 
In general everything was ok. Someone at the table next to us was exclaiming: \" It's my favorite place on Earth!\" And that made me feel claustrophobic, sad and Christmassy all at the same time. Just skip the cheap wine, folks."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a dozen or so times in the past decade, and have always had a very good experience, so am baffled by the negativity. Food is SO much better than Carrabas, Olive Garden, etc., I don't know if locals don't know good Italian food when they taste it (I'm from Boston, which has many great Italian restaurants), or if it's a weekend problem (I almost never eat out on weekends, since service is always worse on busy nights at any restaurant). We went Wednesday for my birthday, and it was great; the Italian nachos appetizer was one of the tastiest dishes I have had in last few years, and the bill was less than I anticipated. My favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte, not a 5 star Chicago/NY/Boston restaurant, but it is very good for the money, and I heartily recommend it."}
{"text":"I came with a party of 6 people and, despite being almost completely empty, they tried to shove us into a four person booth. I eventually asked to be moved and they accommodated us. We ordered drinks and apps and everything was good. When our entrees came out, however, one persons food did not come. The waitress, who seemed like a nice woman, came over and told us that they lost the ticket and asked him to fill out a new order form and asked if we wanted to see the manager. We said yes and the manger never came. My friends food came out a good 10 minutes after the rest of ours. Working at a resturant I know that the right thing to do would have been to comp the meal for the person whose food was late, or at the very least offer condolences and provide a discount. However, when it was time to pay, the waitress brought out a full price check for everyone, including the person whose food was late. I asked to speak to a manager again and was told the \"manager was too busy\" but that she would see about the ticket. She came back like 7 minutes later with a new check that had two dollars off. Not once did she apologize for the kitchen losing the ticket or try to fix the mistake by discounting the meal, only after we asked did she make an effort, begrudgingly I might add, to reconcile the mistakes that were made. The food was amazing, especially the macaroni bites, it's just a shame that the management and staff practice such poor customer service. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Sometimes there is not much of a crowd here, but we always eat at the bar because:
1)  Instant seating where we want (including outside on the rare days here when it is nice enough).
2)  No singing lady...
3)  As regulars (every week or so) we have developed a good relationship with the bartender.

So our service is usually great since we are in the bar with the bartender as our server.

We come on Thursdays because it's \"Mezzo Prezzo\" (half price wine day) and a 1.5 liter of their surprisingly delicious house red (Valoroso) is only $15. Add some free fresh bread and two appetizers for $9 and we have a great meal!

This is also one of the only places we've ever found that lets you take the rest of the wine home (they seal it in a plastic bag) - any restaurant can do this and they all should!

More on the bread - it is a nice fresh baked loaf with EVOO/balsamic/pepper on the side as you like, one of the best anywhere I think!

For appetizers, we have tried them all and now our favorite pair is meatballs and Bruchetta.  The combination is a great meal!  The meatballs are just the right size and the sauces with the Bruchetta are awesome.
When we want a real treat, though, we get the Mediterranean sea bass!  It is amazingly tasty and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Good service and food. Was surprised by other reviews. Server was Cody, who was attentive and knowledgable. The food was served fresh and hot in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I have already left a comment on that link from the same review posted elsewhere. No response as of yet. One more negative experience to associate with this company"}
{"text":"The food is decent but the service, maintenance of their restaurant, and cleanliness really need some work. Their men's restroom was downright scary - it even had a stall door that was actually hanging off of its hinges - and our order was taken incorrectly. 

Years and years ago, I remember coming here and considering it pretty fancy. Now, I consider it something between a gas station and a McDonald's."}
{"text":"Visited on 10/11/14 and will never return. It took forever for our waitress to even acknowledge us and ask for drink orders. We told her we were ready to order which we did but she wrote nothing down and asked us immediately after for the order again. Use paper and pen next time girl. THEN while waiting FOREVER for our food we hear her cussing the cooks out regarding our order and she stated that her tip will now be fu*%ed because our food was late. LOL smh. We asked for more water twice and more bread. She brings the water pitcher and leaves it on our table??? No bread. After 30+mins we asked for a manager. The manager comes with our food but tells us \"I wanted to wait a few more mins for your order before coming over to you\" Smh once again. The manager told us that our meal was comped and offered dessert to which we declined. We just wanted to get out of there. We should've paid attn when we walked in because the manager was walking a familiy out apologizing for the bad service. I wonder how many tables had comped meals that night. The food is less thatn mediocre and the staff sucks. The only person who seemed to care was the hostess."}
{"text":"So we ended up here last night for my sisters 17th birthday. This was our first time here after another relative said that the Macaroni Grill was really great.

It was Friday night around 6pm we arrived, a huge long wait, so we knew we'd be waiting for about an hour for 7 people +1 baby (highchair). There were a ton of other large families inside waiting to escape the cold, so we decided to wait outside with the rest of the families since there was no more room inside to sit and wait (we had wished they had heating lamps outside but there wasn't). We didn't mind, were pretty optimistic people when it comes to a 1st time restaurant experience!

We ended up waiting for 1 1/2 hours to be seated. My other sister walked in to ask for the wait time and whoever she talked to said we were only waiting for about 1/2 an hour which was a lie. Others got called and we were basically the only large group left to be seated which we found deterring. We made it inside because it was becoming too cold, it was dead empty, there were also empty tables around, so we couldn't understand why the waiters couldn't push two tables together to make a big one for us.

After being seated at the table around 8pm (mind we arrived around 6pm), the waitress was nice but not very attentive. There was already the given gratuity tip because of our group of over 6 people, so we didn't know if she was just busy with other customers or just didn't care.

Things that were ordered: Carbonara & Ginger Soda (me), Penne Rustica & Coconut Italian Ice (birthday girl), Eggplant Quadtani (mother), Mom's Ricotta Meatballs & Spaghetti (brother), Farfalle w/chicken & garlic sauce (don't remember the name, other sister ordered this). Everyone else ordered sodas or coffee.

Wait time.. we waited almost an hour for our food, they kept loading us up on bread. We didn't order anything that would take that long, all pasta dishes, the restaurant was half empty and the cooks were still there so there was no shortage of staff.

Carbonara & Ginger Soda: Was pretty good, although I'm not sure I like the idea of a poached egg on top (I'm the old fashioned and like it mixed together - just cook it up a bit to make sure the egg isn't raw anymore ;). It needed some salt but the prosciutto made up for it so I avoided adding anymore. But without mixing the dish, the noodles and \"sauce\" it came with was bland. The Ginger Soda was... interesting. It was good, but you couldn't taste the ginger, mostly the cream, lemon and lime. It kinda tasted like a Fizzy Limeade with cream than a Ginger Soda.

Penne Rustica & Coconut Italian Ice: Birthday girl was upset it came with 3 small shrimps, overall she enjoyed it but wished there was more shrimp for the price you paid for. The Italian Ice was good, a lot of coconut flavoring, she ended up ordering two since she liked it so much.

Eggplant Quadtani: It was alright, nothing to write home about.

Mom's Ricotta Meatballs & Spaghetti: This arrived to my brother cold, we alerted a different waitress who took the dish back to be reheated. When our original waitress came back (after 30min of being MIA from giving us our drinks, another waiter gave us our food) she asked if everything was alright but didn't ask about the missing dish. We kept trying to find another waiter or waitress, but they had suddenly all disappeared - or they were conveniently ignoring our table. 15min later we caught our waitress again and said we were waiting for his dish to be reheated. The waitress apologized and found his dish, when she brought it back the pasta was hot but the meatballs were still cold. We were offered a new Spaghetti dish which we gladly accepted, but it was still charged to our bill while the other wasn't.

Farfalle w/chicken & garlic sauce: Was good, but it had a very raw garlic taste, she wasn't too thrilled over the dish.

When we were nearing 10pm we were ready to leave. It took the waitress almost half an hour to get back my friends credit card and receipts when the place had about 6 other tables for the night. Before we left, we finally let it slip that it was my sisters birthday (maybe if we let it slip earlier maybe we would've gotten better service? I think not...), and the waitress had a deadpan of, \"Fml.\" on her face. The guy who sung the opera to her was pretty good though.

Overall, for the wait we had to endure, and pay a large bill with not even sub-par food, we would've gotten better customer service and food at Olive Garden or even Carraba's. I know we're not supposed to mention other food chains in our reviews on Yelp, but it has to be said. If Macaroni Grill doesn't step up their customer service and food staff, this location might as well close as their other location on Ray."}
{"text":"When looking at restaurants, I was shocked to see that Macaroni Grill only had 2.5 stars, but now I understand why.  

It wasn't busy and our waitress was inattentive.. Or maybe just poorly trained.  We had to ask for our waters and they were never refilled.  

I tried the mama's trio which was extremely disappointing.  The fettuccine Alfredo was the best thing on the plate (which is handedly the easiest thing to make), the chicken parmigiana was burnt and the lasagna was on par with Chef Boyardee [to be generous].  

We were rushed through the entire beginning of our meal.  Then, we waited about 20 minutes before getting the bill.  We planned to get cappuccinos and dessert but decided against it after that."}
{"text":"Brought my friend and her husband for lunch. Location had one manager and one waitress. Total tables where 5. Didn't get acknowledged for a Moment then got the I'll be right with you. So I waited. Finally got a table. Food wasn't the best. Calamari was over cooked. Asked for lemons which came about 5/10 minutes later. I was done with the appetizer by then. We had to ask for water since none was brought to the table as a refill. I'm a tad embarrassed since it was my friends first time. I'll never go to this location again. 5 tables shouldn't be hard to manage with two ppl. Manager said that dessert was on the house but by the time she asked we had still been waiting on the Togo boxes. Simply retarded."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Macaroni Grill in a number of years. I most likely won't be back to one for a very long time. Unlike other reviews, the service was actually very good, except for the copious amount of perfume our waitress bathed in. Very off-putting when so much of taste depends on smell. The food came out quickly but was still warm at best. I got the chicken scallopini and it was ok, other than the lack of heat. My wife got Mama's Trio. She didn't really care for any of it. I tried it and agree that none of it was very good, and also lukewarm.  The saving grace was that was that we had a gift card and didn't have to waste too much of our own money. If there is a next time, we'll re-gift it."}
{"text":"This place has def gone down! I remember a time I could give this place 5 stars ... No longer !! I didn't get any bread... Hello !!! Bread and rosemary !!! Give it to me !! I also ordered extra shrimp and mushrooms with my meal .. Apparently they don't incorporate extras into the meals anymore they  just cooked them and placed them on the side ... Very disappointing ... It will be a long while before I come here again ..!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times in the last couple of years and have always had great food and great service. 

They have a great price on their house wine and they serve in big glass, which is the way I like it!! The sangria that they have here is absolutely yummy..not a whole lotta alcohol in it...but it is pretty and delicious.

They have great appetizers like the calamari, the bruschetta, and of course the bread they serve with the olive oil is just what I need to clean out my arteries. It is so addicting. 

We usually get whatever special pasta dish they are running and have never been disppointed."}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill strikes me as the perfect \"Office Christmas Party\" location. The food is average, or maybe slightly above average in a totally conventional way, but lacks the creativity that some of its non-corporate counterparts offer. 

Service is actually the best thing here, in my opinion, but I get the feeling that the staff can't stand working there. I can't really back that up, and no one has ever said that to me explicitly, I just get that vibe. 

It would be a good place to take small children or large groups. For birthdays, there is a staff singer (I think that's how it works, at least) who sings a Venetian serenade as if it were on a gondola. A little cheesy, I know, but some people are into that."}
{"text":"I like the bread with olive oil and spices.  The food is okay.  I'm spoiled though.  My lady's from a big Italian family.  Once you've had her grandma's cooking, there's really just no going back.  The service is a little slow at times, but they are very accommodating with odd / special requests.  We started with the Mozzarella Fritta, which are as close to mozzarella sticks as you get at the RMG.  Wedges of cheese breaded and fried and served with a red sauce on the side and basil pesto over the top.

For the entree we split the Shrimp Portofino - sauteed shrimp with mushrooms, pine nuts and spinach in a tangy lemon butter sauce with angel hair pasta on the side.  The sauce is all in/on the shrimp spinach side, and we got a side of asiago cheese sauce (closest to alfredo they've got) for the pasta.  It was all pretty tasty and all in all we were happy with the food, the portions and the prices.  Nothing was mind blowingly good, but the Mama's Trio (lasagna, chicken cannelloni and chicken parmesan) looked pretty damn good from across the table.  It looked better than the Tour of Italy thing at Olive Garden, definitely bigger portion wise and I heard it was tasty though I didn't have room to try any.

If you ask, they will bring you garlic butter for dipping your bread in instead of olive oil.  I prefer the olive oil, but if you're feeling indulgent and garlicly, sometimes it's nice to have that option."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wonderful server.   Mike went beyond any expectation to meet our dietary needs.   Awesome job."}
{"text":"The first time I came here is a blur as in so long ago But I went to one in L.a liked it so i came to this one. The place was kind of busy so we sat in the bar and the girl who took care of us was awesome. A bottle of wine and crayons were given to us quickly. And it was a date which she realized so I noticed she check first to see if she should come by. THIS was awesome of her. Anywhoo on to the Italian food. I got the oops.. too much wine. I think I got marinated chicken. and the date got a pasta bowl. WE loved it. Everything came out when it needed to. The stars were aligned. In fact, I can't wait to come back.

And Seriously, an Italian place that lets you color on the table? 
I'm sold. 

Oh one last note. If your wondering if you should come here or say Olive garden... I'd pick here... :) :) 

Because the house wine is sooo much better.. Seriously."}
{"text":"Good food, with kid friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went here with my Mom today, for a late afternoon lunch. 

Upon being seated at the booth, I noticed an entire sheet of breadcrumbs as I sat. I had to wash my hands anyway and I'm not a huge complainer so I just wiped them off myself but it was still quite unpleasant. The waiter noticed and remarked on it but did nothing to try and help me out. He took our drinks as I left to wash my hands. The bathroom was nice and clean, foam soap and all except zero paper towels to use except for one semi-used one left behind by a good Samaritan at some point in the day.

After having to rigorously air-dry my hands, I returned to the table as our drinks were being poured. The waiter asked if we'd like an appetizier, but knowing myself with Italian restaurants I declined as did my mother and he left. Being perpetually undecided, we still didn't have our orders when he returned less than five minutes later but we each ordered side salads. He answered my questions about a couple menu items in a kind, non-condescending way (because I'm not too keen on Italian cuisine terms and I have no choice but to risk sounding ditzy).

The side Caesar was a little dry, could've used some more dressing for sure. And I was mid-bite with bread in my mouth when he was pouring the fresh pepper on it so it could've used way less of that as well but that's my doing. All in all, the salad was OK but definitely asking for more dressing next time.

Finally, my mom got a pasta and I got the Chicken Milanese. It was very good, especially the chicken which I ate all of. Not overcooking or dry like some chicken plates can be, and not too greasy as this was pretty fried. The roasted potatoes were yummy, evenly spiced and roasted to perfection except for slight dryness. I honestly rationed all my room for the chicken and I wasn't into even trying the arugula just because I'm still a kid who doesn't eat her veggies.

It's not often I try new things and enjoy it as much as I did this dish, so it made up for the poor cleanliness I had encountered prior. And the friendliness of the waiter, who offered his wine tasting class on Thursdays, was a pleasant surprise as well. I would definitely come back here just to have the same dish again."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. The waiter gave us nothing but attitude. Food was decent but will never go back again."}
{"text":"Safe place to have dinner.  Quality of food was up to their normal standard.  As usual the noise was not conducive for good conversation.  But the food was a welcome comfort after being on the road all week."}
{"text":"I felt like I was in a Persian bazaar instead of having dinner. Waitress was just doing her job and was very nice. The 1st 5 minutes in we hear about the gift card deals that they are offering. 5 minutes later we get our wine along with \" Do you want to order the gift cards now? - I can put them on your bill!\" We didn't even get a chance to look at our menus and we are getting pushed to buy gift cards. It's been at least 5 years since I've been to a Macaroni Grill but you can tell things have changed. They are into the world of upsell big time."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location once, but I've been to Macaroni grill on numerous occasions. I was saddened to see they closed the location in mesa down. The bread with vinegar and oil is so yummy. My favorite dish is the penne rustica. My hubby loves the sausage and peppers dish. Wish we had one closer to us."}
{"text":"If I could give negative 10 stars I would! Waited an hour for cold food! Never again will I go to this establishment again. Wasted my time I could of went somewhere else for a hot plate and good service."}
{"text":"Came on cinco De mayo for a coworker birthday ! Because it was her birthday I stayed BUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE was horrible and slow. Tania was the waitress was taking care of a few tables but I wonder how would they handle a crowd on a busy day.  The food was delicious!disappointing tip :The olive oil for the bread no.longer have chili flakes which makes the olive"}
{"text":"I would rate zero stars if I could. The service has been non existent to say the least. I realize it is mother's day and I appreciate the fact that it's been semi busy. I can see why it's not as busy as other places however. We ordered our food and it was 2 hours later before we saw our waitress again in order to inquire about our order. The bathroom was the most atrocious disgusting bathroom I have ever seen. There was feces on the wall. The changing stations were dirty with excitement. We notified staff and nearly 2 hours later it was still that way. After asking about our food order, the gentleman (not our server,)  who stated he would check in it for us disappeared and never came back. I will never come here again. When we finally received our food, it was ice cold. We went next door to Chili's and ate. At just we were served there within 20 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"My meal, the Classic Italian Bake, was a solid 5 stars. The environment was great too. The service, however, was mediocre at best. That being said, the food was good enough to have me coming back regardless of the service."}
{"text":"These wonderful people let my aunt and I spend an excessive amount of time for lunch getting gently drunk while they kept my little pint of ice cream in the freezer (it was still sealed) and made us feel as comfortable as home so we could enjoy our time together. Thank you."}
{"text":"Not thrilling.
We ordered take out for the office today, got a few lunch combos whole wheat fettuccine and soups, along with a couple salads.
But when I informed the cashier that I wanted the daily special soup instead of the tomato, as I am allergic to tomatoes, this did not seem to affect my receiving the tomato soup, and the whole wheat fettuccine meal was bland, dry with very fatty chicken, no comment from the salad eaters.
The tiramisu was very nice though, hence the two stars."}
{"text":"I don't usually review chains nor do I usually find myself dining at them often but I am baffled by the low/negative reviews on this one.  We don't have this chain near where I live and I was traveling for business and it was literally a mile away from where I had to be so it was perfect for a quick lunch.

  I ordered a 3 course special they had going on which I regret because when traveling for business I can't stuff myself and then go meet with a client and this food was delicious so I took small bites of everything.  I think next time I would do a salad to avoid temptation of pasta but it was so good. 

  I mean I don't see how anybody could prefer another \"Italian\" chain.  Their bread is 100x better and comes with olive oil.  My meal came with a fried cheese stick which was not good - my only complaint/ thing I didn't have to tell myself to stop eating.  It also came with a Caesar salad which was a bit over dressed but other wise delicious.  I would ask for dressing on the side unless you are into more dressing than veggies LOL!  I had the fettuccine as my dish and it had Gorgonzola, pancetta, and spinach.  It was great but rich.  I can't wait to come back and try a salad or maybe spaghetti and meatballs."}
{"text":"I know the service is lousy, but I come here because I like the food. HOWEVER, today the service was exceptionally terrible. We went in at 3:30 in the afternoon, it wasn't busy at all. Another table sat down at about the same time. We ordered, the other table ordered. The other table got their food and we waited and waited and waited.... We heard two waitresses bicker and argue at each other about clearing the tables, which was entertaining because I thought their might be a full on cat fight.... We waited and waited and we ran out of bread and no one asked us if we wanted more.....AN HOUR later, I asked about our food. Finally it came out ...... No apologies, no discount, ..... Never again!!!! Don't go here for good service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have not been to this place in 10 years . I was actually craving Italian pasta and my husband laughed when I said this place . I got the chicken Parm and it was actually really good and so was the pasta . He was really happy with his Marsala as well . The  bread was really warm and I was really impressed . I will say the service is not good . The waitress was too busy talking with the staff that she never came too our table . But that's what happens with chain businesses, it's all college kids that don't care . From all the 1 stars of bad service you think corporate would step in and start clearing house . The food is good so just hire better staff and it could be a great place"}
{"text":"Both the steak and salmon were terrific.  They were great about substituting the side dish so I could satisfy my pasta craving. The steak is new to their menu. We made use of their labor day special so one of the entrees was free. A very enjoyable meal. Recommended."}
{"text":"I have been to this Macaroni Grill location many, many times and have always had a great dining experience.  The servers and managers have always been friendly and professional.  
Last night,  however, we were seated in Sylas's section.   From the beginning, it was a trainwreck.  He initially greeted us, brought over an oversized bottle of wine (which he never talked about and never took away from our table the entire time we were there), and took our drink order.  Midway through taking the drink order, he stopped to talk to either a coworker or another guest...awkward.  After a LONG while of watching him converse with employees at the hostess stand and bar, he brought our drinks and took our order.  He checked on us minimally but did not seem genuinely concerned with our experience. Overall, I will most likely go back to this restaurant, but will NEVER receive service from Sylas again."}
{"text":"This is a big chain restaurant so the review here will be pretty short.

Not a bad place to spend dinner with the family.  Food in my opinion is around the same caliber as that Olive Garden place.  I don't mind it, but it doesn't entirely ring true Italian down home food in my mind.  Romano's is fast, efficient, and consistent like most chain restaurants are.

I'm on the cheap cheap, so I kinda don't like the prices here!  Seems a bit overpriced to me for pasta and bread.  Does anyone realize that you can easily make fresh pasta and sauce at home with some basic ingredients for a fraction of the cost??  Takes some elbow work but the results can be astounding.  Plus, guys...you can impress the girls (or guys if that's your sort of thing)!  Nothing gets the wheel turning more than cooking a meal.  Try it!  Have you ever seen Nigella Lawson on tv cooking?  She oozes pure sensuality!  Ooh la la!  She's sexy and she knows it!

Back to the restaurant.  The loaves of bread are good if they come out oven warm and fresh, if you get a cold one send it back!  It can get hard as a rock.  Nothing in particular raised my eyebrows on the menu so I settled for the make your own pasta deal.  It was reasonably priced too at about $12.  You get to choose your type of pasta, sauce, and toppings.  I went with the rigatoni with meat sauce, topped with mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, and asparagus.  It was ok, but nothing to get worked up about.  Pasta was cooked al dente, but really it's just not the same as fresh made pasta.  Romano's uses pasta from a box (I think it's Barilla) but at least the quality was on the higher end.  Sauce was good to sop up with the bread.  I wish though that the dish was a larger portion, and had more of the toppings I chose because they were a bit on the stingy side.

Service was with a smile, excellent dude with a good attitude and kept our drinks filled and our table clean.    

The menu was fairly varied, with lots of choice between antipasti, salads, pizzas, pastas, and entrees.  I don't mind coming again every once in a while for a dining visit but it's not something I would plan out.  Typical chain.  Too many taste buds and too little time to not dine somewhere more exciting!"}
{"text":"The big disappointment for me here is the ever-changing menu. You know that crabbing for a specific meal from a specific location that you get? I had that. Seems they change the menu here often and you can't get the former menu items once they are gone. I don't get that. That aside, the food is still always great here. The staff is super friendly. We arrived at 11:05 am, but waited for another person in our party to arrive. I took the opportunity to go wash up but imagine my surprise when I opened the door to the ladies' restroom only to find the cleaning GUY standing in there! He seemed irritated by my interruption of his cleaning and seemed increasingly irritated that I told him I'd wait outside until he was done. He was the low point of my visit but since he wasn't cooking or serving my food, I'll still come back to eat."}
{"text":"I can't believe what a horrible experience this was tonight! I picked this restaurant for our Mother's Day dinner. What a mistake! Even after making a reservation, we still waited an hour just to get seated! (If I didn't think every other restaurant nearby would be busy too because of Mother's Day, we would have left). They were so unorganized. We finally were seated in the booth right next to the kitchen. We should have known it was only going to get worse when our waiter told us we needed to be patient because the food was coming out slow. To say the kitchen was pure and utter chaos would be an understatement! There was food sitting there forever untouched, getting cold waiting to be served. Nobody seemed to know what they were doing. There was not one single bus person in the entire restaurant. Does Macaroni Grill not have bus people? Service was slow, food was sub par. The lettuce in my salad was extremely wilted. Also, I added shrimp to my salad which was about $5 more....they put 4 small shrimp on it! What a rip off! My husband ordered the penne rustica as he normally does but it was very dry. It looked like it had no sauce on it whatsoever. They brought me the wrong dish as first. Knowing it was Mother's Day, and they would be busy, you would think the manager would have planned a lot better. What a disappointment to waste part of our special day at this place! Two and a half hours of my life I can never get back!!!"}
{"text":"There was a time when I thought Romano's Macaroni Grill was the freaking bomb.  Not sure if my taste has changed or their food has dropped off some.  Overall it's just okay.  Nothing sucks but none of it is great.  

This location was in easy walking distance to my hotel, and I was too lazy to drive anywhere.  I sat at the bar and had several Italian margaritas (actually decent).  Tried the olives as an appetizer ($4 special).  The olives came warm and with bread.  They were okay.

Next up was the caesar salad.  Not bad.  Now on to the entree, Chicken Marsala.  It was just okay.  Chicken breast was really thin.  Marsala sauce, just okay.  

Ended the night with another appetizer (I was still damn hungry), fried artichokes, along with dessert (vanilla gelato).  Much of the artichoke appetizer was like eating dried leaves.  The bigger and meatier pieces were pretty good.  The gelato was actually the best item I ate all night."}
{"text":"This location used to be on our list of favorite restaurants, but our recent visit there leads me to say that the place has gone downhill.   The \"sea-bass\" was overcooked, and yet seemed like it was cooked 15 minutes earlier!  It was not what I am used to being served when I order sea-bass which is usually a thick moist cut of fish.  This was a tiny portion of thin fillets of tasteless  fish which totally seemed more of a trout than a sea-bass.  This dish cries out for some pasta on the side - all it has is basically a warm salad.  The only saving grace of the dish was the little pools of balsamic reduction - the only hint of flavor in the dish.  We also ordered the Shrimp Portofino which once was a very flavorful dish, but it lacked any semblance of sauce or flavor.  Also surprisingly disappointing is the complementary bread which used to be perfectly little loaves cooked fresh.  I believe they have replaced their fresh baked bread with ones that are baked elsewhere, reheated and brushed liberally with olive oil.  The bread now lacks the freshness and rosemary flavor of the old ones from years ago.  The calamari was very good, but the thimble of sauce was tiny compared to the size of the basket and it was very chunky making it impossible to dip.  The lobster stuffed clams appetizer was pretty awful - firstly is was severely overcooked.  I could detect neither clam nor lobster in these things which were 95% bread crumbs and celery - not a good choice for $10.  Service was below par - staff seemed to be elsewhere most of the time."}
{"text":"I received a Macaroni Grill gift card from a coworker so my husband and I stopped in on a weekday evening for dinner. There was a short wait for tables, so we started our in the bar area. The bartender was busy serving the tables in the bar area but quickly acknowledged our presence and hussled to get us drinks when he was able to do so. 

Out wait wasn't long, a sweet hostess took us to our table. It had been a while since we had been to Macaroni Grill, and the menu had been changed since that last visit. My husband was disappointed they no longer served pasta fagioli, or even minestrone. He decided to skip the soup of the day and we instead tried the Italian Tapas, which were a special offer... 2 for $9 I believe? The Baked Prosciutto & Mozzarella was fantastic, I wish we had just ordered a couple of those. The Oven-Fired Artichoke Hearts were a disappointment, very bland. For our entrees my husband had the Chicken Under a Brick. I had the Spaghetti with Meatballs. Overall it was ok. Not great, but ok. 

Service was friendly and efficient, otherwise this would be a 2 star review. Despite the experience being \"A-OK\" I don't see us returning anytime soon, unless I get another gift card. If I am going to spend my own money on food, I want more flavor then Macaroni Grill seems to be able to offer."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have eaten at this restaurant with a bad outcome. The first time was just very bad service but this time was very concerning. We had called ahead to check their allergy friendly food because my daughter has sever egg and nut allergies but we do eat out fairly often with great success. I was informed that they had egg free pasta. When we ordered I once again asked the waiter to make sure my daughters pasta was egg free and he assured me the gluten free pasta was egg free. He was very kind and read the ingredients on the bread and said she could have it and she had it with no problem. However, ten minutes after eating her pasta my daughter became very ill and started vomiting and broke out into hives. I rushed her to the bathroom where she had to vomit. When I came out with her she was still very ill and we had to leave. My husband proceeded to pay the bill even though we did not eat much of the food. Once again the waiter informed me the pasta my daughter ate was egg free. My daughter was okay after a few hours. 

When I called the next after noon to speak to the manager, he was apologetic and said the manager or kitchen manager should have been informed about the food allergy that way the food could have been cooked separately . He also told me the pasta my daughter received had whole eggs in it! However, there was no offer to comp our meals that we did not really eat. I also called corporate macaroni grill with not much response except they would alert their risk management department? this was a week ago with no answer from them. 

I understand mistakes happen, but this was careless and I had asked multiple times to ensure that she received the correct pasta. I believe no one checked the pasta box with the ingredient list. From now on, I will have to ask to read the ingredient lists myself."}
{"text":"Found hair THREE SEPARATE TIMES during our dinner. The first time, there was a small price of hair in my boyfriends glass of water. Ok, strike one. Then when our entrees came out, my uncle pulled out a long piece of BLONDE HAIR (mind you we all have dark hair) on top of his lasagna! Ok, strike two.  We notified our waiter, who took the plate back to have it remade. Not even 5 minutes after our waiter left, he came with (what we thought) was re-made plate. My uncle cuts his Lasagna open and guess what's hiding under all of the sauce, THE SAME PEICE OF LONG BLONDE HAIR! Strike three, were out. None of us ate our entrees, and walked out across the street to Chilis (guess what, NO HAIR IN YOUR FOOD AT CHILIS!!) If you think I'm joking then, the jokes on you for eating at such a disgusting place."}
{"text":"We were sat quickly as the restaurant was not busy. It was my daughters graduation and we were all so disappointed. The service was horrible and the food was just ok. Our waiter must have forgotten about us cause we sat and ordered and waited and waited for just over an hour for our food then it was cold. All while the table next to us sat after and received the food before us. They left and our food was still not at our table. This is my second time at this Macaroni Grill with the same horrible service and  crappy  waiter (2 different waiters) . All I can say is THIS macaroni grill needs management to traintheir people better. Customer service is a lost skill at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant being next to the Hampton Inn is was staying out I stopped in.  I ordered the Fig Marsala Pork Chop.   The pork chop was one of the best I every had.  The restaurant wasn't very busy when I stopped in.  Jessica my server did a great job."}
{"text":"This place does not know how to keep a reservation. My boyfriend and I called and set up a reservation for dinner on Valentine's day.  We show up for our reservation and they don't have any record of us setting one up. We ask how long the wait is and because it's Valentine's day the wait is 30 minutes. I don't ever recommend setting a reservation with this location."}
{"text":"Ya know, a few years ago this place had way more tasty food until.......these books came out, \"Eat this and not that\" and slammed Macaroni Grill's tasty food as being unhealthy due to calories.  Since that time, the menu has changed (obviously to minimize the slamming of their menu items) and wow, I guess fat tastes good because the quality of taste has gone way down.  Their food seems like it is starving for flavor and while I have continued to come in to this restaurant due to the convenience and proximity of my home, I am constantly underwhelmed by the items I choose.

I will say, the staff has always been very good.  They are friendly and attentive and there has never been a complaint in this area.  The décor is also very inviting and a comfortable environment to dine - giving off that rustic Italian feel.   However, let's face it, the food is the star of the show and thus the \"stars\" rating here, and unfortunately, this place to me is just ok...."}
{"text":"The food here kid almost always good but they lack good servers. I have read all the other reviews and they are true - food is good but restrooms aren't clean, servers have NO idea what they are doing - even the buses are bringing food out before the other plates are taken away.  Our server didn't understand how to pour wine and in fact told us he doesn't like wine so \"you do whatever\"..... really!  He couldn't even recommend the house wines!  That should never happen in an Italian restaurant.  I asked a question about my meal while he was at the table to put cheese on and he never came back - with either the cheese or the answer to my question!!  GONE!  Also prices have gone way up and the food doesn't match it.  Been there, done that should be the headline for this review."}
{"text":"I treated myself to a late dinner on Saturday evening. I had a coupon for $10 off of minimum $30. I love leftovers, so I ordered a lot of food. Of all of the items that I ordered, approximately half of them came out at the appropriate temperature. 
The goat cheese Peppadew peppers and the pasta Di Mare were hot and delicious. The mac & cheese bites and the spicy ricotta meatballs were less than hot. The Bibb and Blue side salad  was both the perfect size and temperature. I ended the meal with New York cheesecake which was still frozen; a great disappointment.
Other minor annoyances included:
~My wine was initially served to me in a water glass, I had to ask for a wine glass.
~ I asked for cappellini pasta and ended up with linguine.
~Knowing I would be taking a lot of food home, I asked for the largest to-go boxes available, and was presented with medium size boxes that were too small.
~ I prefer to box up my own leftovers, and I needed to state this multiple times before the server took his hands out of my food.

Overall, I would rate my experience a three out of five stars based largely on minor annoyances that could be easily corrected. Most of my annoyance was based on the service, where the server was either trying to hard (being overly suggestive with menu items when I had not asked for his opinion on my menu choices) or in some cases was not paying close enough attention to the cues that I was providing. A note to servers everywhere, if there are two options, ask the customer which of the two they would prefer, rather then deciding for the customer and hoping the customer is happy with your decision. My server assumed I would want my wine in a water glass along with a cute little story about mama Ramano's cooking habits; I did not. My server apologized for forgetting to place my order with cappellini pasta, but never offered me the opportunity to have the meal remade the way I originally requested it. As stated above, the server began handling my leftovers despite my repeated requests to allow ME to handle my leftovers.

Ramano's Macaroni Grill is a good restaurant, and I will be returning. Despite my dissatisfaction with some server behaviors, the service was prompt and I really enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places. They had the most amazing bread and if you knew about it pesto dipping sauce! Yum! Unfortunately... They don't make the pesto anymore and they've changed the recipe for the bread... :( it looks the same but texture and taste are way different now. Also the salad isn't great. 

On a good note they make tasty Chicken Parm. 

And they have a chocolate cake that's pretty good unless they took that off the menu too. 

I'm a huge bread fan and if you screw that up at Italian... It takes a lot to win me over. And everything else is only fair. Sad really. My husband and I used to go here all the time. Trying to find a new fav Italian joint."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here, tonight! My boyfriend and I were looking for a place that was relaxing and yummy because we didn't want to cook. Perfect comfort food.

Service: Our waitress, Red, totally made our night. She is clever, funny, and sarcastic -- just our cup of tea. Ginger friends forever, we love ya! #hiddenginger

Atmosphere: relaxed, but nice. Come in nice clothes or casual clothes, no one cares. There is a private (ish) area for large parties and a full bar (yummmm).

Food: My boyfriend had the Blackened Chicken and loved it. I had the salmon and asked for it to be burned. The manager came out and actually had a discussion with me about how well-done I wanted my salmon -- awesome service!!! And they got it right! THE FIRST TIME! Absolutely amazing. This is the first restaurant to understand me.

Go here, eat here, have fun here. Great place!

P.S. You can color on the tablecloths. Coloring AND  eating! Can't get ant better. Get creative, people!"}
{"text":"Fresh off the heels of my latest review of the day comes... this place. Hey, you don't get to use a coupon for a free(!) lunch every day, so back off!

My friend didn't end up going. Actually, I waited until the later afternoon since I was wary of the lunch hour rush. When I did get there, it worked out better than I imagined when I was seated right away and got my food almost suspiciously fast.

The lunch combination allows for a choice of two of a small array of soups, salads, pastas, and half sandwiches. I went with the Roasted Turkey half sandwich (kinda blind, and arugula bitterness came out) and the Carmela's Chicken (great pasta, but awkward bowl made it hard to balance chicken and shrooms in bites). It came with a small loaf of rosemary bread, which was pretty tasty with or without the olive oil and measly helping of vinegar. They have olive oil bottles at each table for easy refilling, but no vinegar bottles, which I thought was unusual.

Overall, I enjoyed the price of free (+tip), but $8.50 is pretty reasonable for a lunch combo at a sit-down place anyway."}
{"text":"I have eaten at other Macaroni Grills in Az and outside. This particular location has issues with the food being overdone. Way overpriced and the sampler platter consisted of a handful of calamari, two pieces of rustic toast with shaved parm and a side of tomatoes \"bruschetta\"- I think not, and three mozzarella sticks FOR $11???? Three slices of tomato with small lumps of mozzarellla on each a Capresse salad?
Quality, quantity and price are so scewed here- better go to Carraba's for almost the same price. Service was good though."}
{"text":"If you eat a gluten free diet, this place is perfect. If my first visit is any indication, I can say with absolute certainty that my (pasta) dish had no gluten in it. The service is excellent. The house wine is delicious. This is where you take a large party when anyone has any food allergies, or no allergies. Modest price and superb service. They are seriously on top of it. Thank you Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"Honestly disappointed. After reading the reviews it doesn't appear that the owner cares about what we think because it's hit-or-miss whether or not your experience will be decent here. We went on a Saturday afternoon it was extremely slow...not too many people were there and it took about 30 minutes to get our drink orders and appetizers and another hour for lunch. After eating we hear the server mention specials for Father's Day to the table next to us which we were not aware of. It would have been nice to be given all the information prior considering what we would order. Barely any food on our plates after waiting ForEver!  
Maybe they think loading you up on carbs before your plate arrives nearly empty will help make it to where its not noticeable for some? It took forever to get a refill on my drink as the waiter was loud and obnoxious with whoever his Friends were at the bar. It was a fabulous lunch date with my honey! I must return NEVER"}
{"text":"I was surprised with the food here at macaroni grill we had never been before and it was someone good.  This place didn't disappoint. I was impressed with the wait staff and I would not say it was expensive but for a date during the day with hubby it was on the pricey side. I would like to come back for dinner and see how that goes."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed eating here tonight.  This is our family goto place since it's great for kids and the food is pretty good normally.  We had to wait over 20 minutes for our drink order to arrive.  We then waited an hour for our food to arrive and they forgot to bring one of our orders.  

The manager had come over earlier and asked how things were and we told him our issues and how disappointed we were considering this was a special birthday dinner and he said he would make it right.  The bill came and not one item was discounted for the poor service.  Not even a free birthday desert.

We have been eating here with the kids for years.  That ended today.  Very disappointed with this restaurant.

Side note:  we ended up bringing all the dinner home because we ended up eating so much bread waiting for dinner to arrive."}
{"text":"This place, I don't know, maybe I am prejudiced after going to Italy this summer but the food (specifically the lasagna) is just so plain and, well, bad."}
{"text":"Erika and josh (jeff) were so accommodating and awesome. Thank you so much for making my experience so welcoming."}
{"text":"Went last night with the family for a night out.  I do not typically patronize chain restaurants and was hesitant about going here.  They offer a gluten free pasta and one person in my party has Celiac so it met they're requirements.

It is nicely decorated inside and at 5:45 on a Saturday night there was no wait which is a bonus in this area of Charlotte.  We were seated and waited approximately 10 minutes before we got up to find out why we weren't being served.  Once that was resolved we ordered.  I had the \"special\" of linguine, with clams and sweet corn something or other which was OK.  The pasta was cooked perfectly the clams and pancetta in the sauce were passable but I kept thinking that it came from a mass market distributor in a preprocessed mishmosh of a bag.  Other people had the Seafood Di Mare and create your own pasta, all which were good.

All in all, this is not a place I'd regularly go to but it was OK for a quick Saturday night dinner."}
{"text":"This place is only getting 2 stars as they comped my salad, meal, glass of wine, and soda without me asking to.

WORST dining experience EVER. First off, not even a fan of this place, but it was a coworker's birthday, and she chose to dine here. It was Race Week in Charlotte, but the restaurant was not overly packed near 7 PM. We were seated quickly, and our waiter took forever to even take our drink orders. 15 minutes in, he finally gets our drink orders. Then within the next 15 minutes, he brings out our drinks, one by one...30 minutes in, we finally get the freshly baked foccacia bread (which is really the only thing I like about Macaroni Grill). 45 minutes in, FINALLY takes our damn order. I was so irritated but tried to keep my cool since I was with coworkers. I asked about the pasta sampler which only caught my eye because of the proscuitto mac and cheese. It also included the sausage quadratini and carmela's chicken. I decided to order that to get a variety. We all ordered salads as well to start. About 20 minutes later or so, the diet coke I ordered never came, so I asked for it. Then he slowly brings one salad out at a time. REALLY? First one, no dressing. Second one, no bleu cheese. Third one, no bleu cheese or pancetta. Fourth one, no ranch dressing on the side or pancetta. Mine, no pancetta. Only the caeser salad was the one that came out how it should be. About...30 minutes later (we were there for over 2 hours...we had no issues talking and hanging out, but it was getting ridiculous!) our food finally came out. As the manager started bringing out the dishes, I mentioned that our salads were all wrong (I finally mentioned as I didn't want our food to be \"messed up\"), and he apologized. Then a server starts to hand me a dish that was completely off and not mine. So...I got to wait for 15 minutes while they re-created my dish, and being the slowest eater of the group, I was tempted to just take it to go. Another dish did not have the mozerrella cheese she had requested. When my food finally came, it was all lacking in flavor. The mac and cheese was as dry as can be, boxed mac and cheese would probably have been better, and I think there were two chunks of proscuitto, the size of a penny. I barely touched my meal, and pushed it aside.

When the bills came, I had heard him say they took the salads off the bills, which was great. I didn't see my bill, and was told everything was taken off. Which was a really nice gesture, but since we were expensing to the company, it was a time where I wished I was paying out of my own pocket. Overall, I would never dine here again. Servers really need to learn how to question the cooks if obvious ingredients are missing, and not hand dishes out one by one. The cooks should also know these standard dishes like the back of their hands and keep the food consistent."}
{"text":"Service was awful - the servers walk around like they have all the time in you world.. Our food sat on the counter for over 7 minutes before it was brought to us; it was cold and dry.  Then I found a piece of unidentifiable food in my dish.  The manager came back and told me it was part of their mushroom mix but it wasn't.  It was meat and it was raw!!  You couldn't even cut it with a fork.  The manager was nice enough to take care of the bill... But she was probably hoping I didn't take that piece of meat with me and make a bigger deal... I think it's just a matter of time before all Macaroni Grills close they are all so gross.  Do yourself a favor,  drive a little further on providence and try Portofinos if you want Italian."}
{"text":"So this is an atypical review - we worked with Megan, Kelly and the wonderful folks at this location 2 weeks ago to cater a big team dinner for my kids soccer team while we were visiting.  They were incredibly helpful, completely accomodating and made the planning of this meal (for about 35 people) completely easy and fun.  The kids and parents loved the food, there were tons of great choices!  Everything - EVERYTHING was taken care of - we were very happy!  Props to all the folks that helped out... we'll definitely call you next year again and rec you to all our NC teams that travel to Ohio!!!!"}
{"text":"I just love this place!!!! I go here about 3-5 times a month and I always get my momas trio and a side salad and I get my favorite waitress on the weekends(Mallory). THe food is very tastful and the prices are good compared to alot of other places in the area. When you go and you get bread in the start of your meal I recommend you ask for some Arobiatta sauce as this is awesome for dipping. I also ask for some red sauce to keep things a little light. If your looking for service and good food go to macshak and ask for Mallory. She is great and funny and always gets things right. LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour that runs till 7:00 PM and starts again at 9:00PM. $3.00 wine and $5.00 flat bread pizza. Very, very good. Great service. Will be back."}
{"text":"I want to like Romano's Macaroni Grill and there are aspects of it that I do like.  The bread with olive oil and vinegar for example.  Delicious.  And the paper table cloth to draw on, childish but still fun.  Also great for passing the time between your servers visits and when the food comes out.  Speaking of the food, I was less than impressed.  My table consisting of myself and three co-workers started our lunch with two appetizers.  We tried the goat cheesed stuffed peppers which were probably the best part of the meal.  They were sweet and creamy and topped with a drizzle of thick balsamic.  They came out a lot smaller than I had expected.  Still good though.  We also tried the spicy sausage and peppers.  This dish was okay but not wonderful.  The peppers had a spicy and slightly smokey flavor.  The sausage was crispy.  Almost too much so for me.  For my lunch I ordered the chicken and mushroom canelloni.  It looked great but was lacking a very important feature.  Mushrooms.  I think I found one piece of what looked like canned mushrooms.  That was a disappointment.  And the chicken was not like what I expected.  It was small chunks of chicken that seemed previously prepared and arrived in bulk.  The pasta itself was dry as if the dish was put under a heat lamp or into an oven before the sauce was added.  The quality and freshness of food here was just lacking from my perspective.  as for the service, not bad but not outstanding either.  Our server, Chris, was new and claimed to be fresh out of training.  He was noticeably nervous. He did get all the orders correct and I give him credit for that.  I have to knock a few points off overall service though for seating four people at a table with clearly two settings and wating until we asked for more before bringing more.  We told the host/hostess that we were a group of four and waited 10 minutes for a table to be \"prepared.\"  I would think with the time that passed they could have managed to put to extra settings on the table.  I think from now on I will stick with Olvie Garden."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for my sister's birthday per her request. We had been here a couple of times a few years ago before my sister left for the military and we had a much better experience those times than we did tonight.

I got to the restaurant a little early before the rest of the party so I came in and asked if I could be seated. The restaurant was pretty empty at 5:30pm which is never a good sign even on a Tuesday. The hostess did not say her name or say much at all except for that our server would greet me shortly. I was seated next to a family of six with four small children and while I usually do not mind dining around children I felt as though the hostess could have seated me at least across from this family instead of literally inches away where the kids were screaming and running around the table. Pretty much every other table in the restaurant was open. The waiter came over and introduced himself and seemed very nice. He poured me a sample of the house wine and I decided to have a glass. About five minutes after that one of the children from the table over who was running around the table projectile vomited inches away from me. While I understand that this is not the restaurants fault it was extremely off putting and I really wish I wouldn't have been sitting inches away from them at this point. I immediately went to the hostess stand and requested a new table. She was accommodating and did relocate me to a booth but still very close to the original table with the child which was somewhat uncomfortable.

My party arrived and we decided to order an appetizer based on the waiter's recommendation. We order the stuffed mushrooms and a couple of salads. We waited, and waited and waited and finally our waiter came back to take our food order still no app after 20 minutes. We ordered our food and our appetizer came out about 30 minutes after ordering. Our food came out about 15 minutes later. Everything moved extremely slowly. Drinks were never refilled. No water was ever refilled. It was my sister's birthday so we asked if she could receive a dessert at the end of the meal. Our waiter said she could choose one so she chose the chocolate cake. It took 20 minutes for the dessert to come out. We were there for over an hour and not because we were taking our sweet time. The food was just okay but not great and I do not think we will be back again. Service is poor and food quality is just okay."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place. My husband wanted to go somewhere else I guess more fancy or upscale, but, alas, we seem to be those parents, that give in and let our kid run the show... 
However, we were actually very impressed. We arrived on Saturday around 6:30 and after a quick 5 minute wait were seated in a booth. After our waiter, Gregg, brought over some warm, salted Rosemary peasant bread, oil and balsamic vinegar, he took our drink orders. 
We ordered the Chicken Marsala, kids marinara and I did the create your own, capellini with a mix of pomodoro and arribiata sauces, extra chopped basil, pine nuts and roasted garlic. We also shared a Cesar salad. Honestly, everything was super, each plate was piled high with flavor and our waiter Greg was fantastic! Very friendly, professional and accommodating. The restaurant was clean and noise level tolerable. You can even learn a little Italian via the speakers in the bathroom. 
We will definitely be returning. Delizioso."}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill in Strongsville is usually hit or miss. This visit was definitely a miss! I ordered the calamari appetizer and Alfredo pasta to go. The ordering process was very easy and the lady that took my order was very pleasant. When I got home I realized the pasta was clumped together and crunchy. I wish I would have checked the food before I pulled off. The calamari was decent but not evenly cooked. I won't visit Macaroni Grill for awhile. Waste of money."}
{"text":"First time here, and I'm not too sure if I do want to come back. 

Coming in, I thought ok this is a cute place. Sat down and was confused why there was a table cloth smaller than the table and on top of that was paper covering the whole table. I find that a bit odd, like this place was meant for a crab boil or something to get down and dirty with your hands. Lol.

Our server, Tania seemed like she didn't want to work to begin with. The only time she came to our table was to get our drink and food order, and when she dropped off our orders. That was it. What was more annoying is that she was being more attentive to her other tables than us. There was no, \"Is every thing ok?\" \"How was the food?\" \"Would you like a refill?\" None of that. And mind you it wasn't even busy when we got in. She said she'll bring back some parmesan to our table, but nothing. We had to flag down the hostess who was near by us to let her know about our server. She was sorry about the situation and that she'll talk to Tania about it as well as the closing manager. Once the hostess walked away she pulled Tania to the side, and told her about it. Clearly this girl had a \"wtf, really?\" look. Very unprofessional when clearly we can see you. Closing manager came by and apologized about the situation that she took off a portion of our bill, which was very nice of her.

Now about the food... Tried the Blackened Chicken and Fettuccine Alfredo. The chicken was good, and the fettuccine needed more seasoning. Overall it was just ok, nothing to crave or brag about."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant, just not this location. TERRIBLE service. We waited almost an hour for our food at lunch and there was only a handful of other tables at the time. Tables were dirty and we were there right after opening, (11:30am) how does that happen?  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I was incredibly unhappy with this experience. I will probably not eat at any Macaroni Grill for a very long time. The waitress was incredibly young and spacy. She put in the wrong order for our table; but you had to feel sorry for her cause the manager yelled at her. Anyone who has been to a Macaroni Grill knows they have an open kitchen; so we could hear everything. The bread wasn't as crusty as it used to be. The calamari was chewy and the batter was gritty. My Pasta Milano had too much rosemary. At the end of the meal, I noticed that our carafe of water had tiny black flakes in it."}
{"text":"Great dinner /  staff great the general manager was super - celebration of birthdays -  food was good
Very accommodating for our large group"}
{"text":"I've come here too many times to count, but this rating is for my latest dining experience, which was 2 weeks ago. When I looked at the menu it had completely changed, which was a good thing except for the fact that they no longer offered my favorite gnocchi soup or the soup and salad combo I used to get. 

So I went ahead and ordered their new addition of chicken melanese with roasted potatoes and green salad and I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing it tasted.
The service was good and so was the food and everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their meal. 

On the other hand another downside to this revamped menu is that it was way more expensive than usual and I'm not quiet sure if it was really worth it. Each dish on the menu was about 5 to 8 dollars more and I did not expect that kind of price hike. 

Everything was fine and I'll probably be coming here again some time in the future when another occasion arises for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! Service is bellow average for a place that wasn't even busy. Bartender even made a Moscow mule with store bought lime juice!"}
{"text":"My wife and I travel to Scottsdale, AZ for spring training each year. This year, we made a mid-August trip to Paradise Valley for my brother-in-law's wedding. For years, we visited the Macaroni Grill on Scottsdale and Gold Dust. Once we learned that the store had closed, we decided to make the trip up to Deer Valley. Not only were we satisfied with our experience, but we were delighted to learn that the general manager from the Scottsdale store had made the move up to Deer Valley. He has been working with the company for a number of years and each year we visit the store, he treats us like friends rather than customers. Christian (I do not recall his last name) was working in the kitchen when we ate at the restaurant but he made a point to break away and speak with us. The quality of food at this restaurant is not over the top but great for the price. I would undoubtedly recommend eating here if you are in reaching distance of the area."}
{"text":"Grant made our pre valentines lunch date a grand success.  Thank you for the great food and the wonderful service."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here before but decided to try. I'm eating alone tonight.  it's a Tuesday night so not much traffic. Light dusting of diners sprinkled through out the restaurant. 
I was seated immediately. 

My waitress, Colleen was a foodies dream. She knew the menu inside out. I think she has actually tasted everything on the menu. When I asked what was good for my meal she picked everything out and it was all delicious!! 

She recommended the ultimate Bellini, which is made with Bacardi rum, prosecco, bianco, peach purée and blk raspberry. 10 thumbs up!!! I'm a Bellini girl so this was different. 

My entree was a buffalo chicken parmigiana. It's breaded and dipped in Frank's red hot hot sauce, topped with melted mozzarella cheese and hot peppers. The capellini is tossed in olive oil and bleu cheese crumbles and blk pepper. Pieces of celery garnish the side. I had some Rosemary baked bread and something called Italian butter, which is olive oil and blk pepper. You dip the bread in the mix and ur taste buds are dancing. 

Dessert was a warm homemade chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and whipped cream. 

I'll definitely come again. I want to try half of the menu!!"}
{"text":"I just wanted something quick and this was convenient to my hotel right next door.  There were only a hand full of other customers and i wad seated immediately. Unfortunately, no one ever came to my table to take my order or even say hello.  After 20 minutes, I walked out and went somewhere else.  Too bad.  I think this could have been a really nice meal."}
{"text":"Came here for a Mother's Day brunch & enjoyed everything very much. They were very busy, but still very attentive, fast service and most importantly the meal was excellent. Their lobster ravioli is one of their best dishes & the only thing my daughter orders. I had a brunch skillet & it was done so well, I really enjoyed it (see photos). The bread ahead of the meal is perfect, crusty on the outside & soft inside, with just the right salt, pepper & oil dip seasoning. The bathrooms could have been cleaner, but all in all we decided we have to come here more often."}
{"text":"It was our anniversary and we decided to eat here for the first time, the food took long to come, but our waiter explained that they are short staff at the back and was kind enough to send the manger to talk to us. He explained what was going on and we understood, we let them know we were a bit disappointed but he was kind to offer us our dinner. As business owners we do appreciate how they handle things and we will be back to give thus place a second chance."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Macaroni Grill...ever. 

We came here for a family outing. I do not usually go to Macaroni Grill, unless it is a special occasion. It is fairly expensive, although not terribly so. We were looking forward to coming here, and enjoying some family time. 

We made a reservation, and showed up a few minutes ahead of time. The hostess was clueless. There was a young girl talking with her, telling her that she was a party of 12, and that they were on their way.
I am not sure if this frazzled the hostess, but she kept turning around grabbing menus and putting them back. Picking up utensils, and then putting them back. The girl stepped aside and we walked up to the hostess desk. We were ignored for a good 2 minutes. We were told that the restaurant was booked solid, and we mentioned our reservation. After a bit more confusion, we were taken to our table.

Our waitress was ALSO clueless. I do not believe that she had much training at all. Our group ordered two bottles of wine, and she had no idea how to open them. My Dad actually had to open one of the bottles because she was unable. She got the second one, but then just put them down on the table and told us we could pour however much we wanted...seriously?! I have never heard of this. Proper etiquette is to open the bottle, pour a small amount for the person who orders. They taste it and approve, if they like it. Then the glasses are to be poured for the other guests first, finishing with the person's glass who ordered the wine. 

Anyway, after that our meals came out rather quickly. What was really odd was that there were six of us, and our dinners arrived in 3 separate deliveries. She would only bring two plates at a time. The final two plates arrived nearly 5 minutes after the rest of ours did, and by someone other than our waitress. Unreal. Other tables around us were attended to properly, and multiple people brought all food to the table at the same time. We were never offered any fresh pepper or parmesan cheese. We were forgotten about until the end when our plates were cleared, boxes brought to us for take home, and then a final walk by from who I assume was the manager. 

My Dad really raved about the Mushroom Ravioli. Said they were excellent. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food itself. So maybe take-out would be a better option. 

This place is so loud. So if you want to do any talking with the people at your table, it can be difficult. I always make sure to fold the paper under that is on the table. If I don't, I always manage to get a paper cut. I don't think that I will be back to eat out at a Macaroni Grill any time soon. What a disappointment this visit was."}
{"text":"So the ladies at the bar are well intentioned.. they were very nice to me.. but nice and well meaning isn't a fix-all for poor service. The problem here is clearly a management thing... I sat at the bar which was filthy and unorganized (ladders, open trash cans and boxes all over). The bar tenders were busy running all over and loudly yelling back and forth to each other.. had to ask for drink then had to \"interrupt\" after sitting there for 20 minutes to ask for a menu. Do not come here if you have had a long day and are looking to relax or unwind. It is hectic, loud, messy and you will not be a priority. Food was average and clearly thrown together. The two stars is a mercy rating because I feel the ladies at the bar just have no idea how their actions are being perceived."}
{"text":"I will never come back here again.  Service was fine, but the food, Blah. I ordered chicken parmigiano, the edges were burned the sauce for the pasta had tons of red pepper flakes in it which made it very spicy. They did bring me new pasta with no red pepper. So that sauce was so bland it tasted like nothing . Prices are high. I can make better at home using jar sauce."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try macaroni grill and when I finally did, the food didn't impress me. If I'm going to eat at an Italian chain, I'd prefer Carrabbas. The portions are mostly pasta, hardly any meat."}
{"text":"I am also surprised by the negative reviews on this restaurant.  I was taken here for my birthday meal.  I read the reviews before I came here but decided to give it a chance anyway.  I am happy I did.
Upon arrival, the host sat up promptly in a booth.  Our server was at our table before the host  walked away.  He kindly introduced himself and wrote his name, Cam, so we would remember it.  He was very friendly and kept check on us the entire time we were there.  Out drinks and bread came out promptly as did our salads.  Our orders came our promptly and correct.  The food was as good as chain Italian food gets.  It met my expectations.  The  restaurant seemed to be clean(even the restrooms) and the staff seemed to care."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night for dinner. We arrived shortly after 8pm and was seated immediately. Our waitress, I think her name was Chery was very pleasant and attentive. Drinks and fresh hot bread came quickly. Hubby orders the mama trio, my son get spaghetti and meatballs, and I ordered the pasta Milano. After she put our orders in the kitchen she came back to inform my hubby that the kitchen was out of lasagna and offered to have more chicken parm instead.  He accepted since that's his favorite anyway.  Chery got my sons order in quickly and brought it out first. This was great because he kept whining about about food.

Overall it's just OK. I'm only giving 3 stars though because this isn't the first time we've gone there and the have run out of something or multiple things. I would give a 2.5 if I could.  Running out of something like classic lasagna before 8pm when place is still open for several more hours on a Saturday night is an indication of poor planning/prepping."}
{"text":"We got here right when they opened, so I assumed everything would be fresh. WRONG.

The bread was tasty, I can give you that. You also can't mess up oil and ground pepper, so that's a freebie.

My noodles were SO. DRY. I got just a very simple Alfredo with shrimp. The shrimp was an extra $4, so I thought I would get my money's worth. What I got instead were 5 quarter sized shrimp, which looked more like beta food or maybe bait for the shrimp that I should have had. 

The noodles were complely stuck together, and there was only alfredo sauce on the bottome 20% of the bowl -- the rest of it was a starchy, gellatenous, mess. Their $15 wine is tasty, and their tea was tasty, but we were served by their bartender and the service kind of showed through, too.

I still like Olive Garden better. At least you get what you pay for. I left here with a $20.00 bill for something I don't think I would have accepted for free.

Not impressed."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and and found they have a an expedited lunch special. We opted for the slower paced dining but it seems they were either under staffed or our section of tables was slightly overlooked. Food was good but took awhile and the server was polite but seemed a little overwhelmed. I'd try again when the time presents itself."}
{"text":"So I travel for work and I am in and out of a lot of restaurants. I know food good and bad. 

Service. 3.5 out of 5 
Gena was my servers name and she was super nice. A few minor things she forgot but she was very nice and I never ran out of water. 

Restaurant. So it is odd that at 8.30 at night the place was practically empty. Maybe it is the neighborhood their are a few restaurants around and they were pretty empty as well. 

Food. 
4 out of 5. I had a side salad with lemon vinegrette. The lemon really shined through. I also had chicken milanese which is a breaded and pan fried chicken that has been pounced thin. It was very good. Not healthy at all but good. 

Bar. 
I had a beefeater martini and it was ok. A little off on how it was made a 3 out of 5. 

I might be back. If I was local I would be back again."}
{"text":"The Macaroni Grill isn't what I remember it to be, the Sahara-Vegas location's service was initially beyond sad. The redeeming factor was that towards the end of our meal, our server probably got a clue and started being more attentive (I realize it was near closing time and the poor fella was pooped), my wife even got a glass of wine on the house. The food is still good, I ordered my usual Penne Rustica and the recommended Pasta Milano my wife got was spot-on. I truly hope this restaurant upholds it's high standards when it was just making it's way into the mainstream since they still offer good eats."}
{"text":"Went there a couple of days ago for their yummy Chicken Scallopini. Sooooo disappointed again. It's apparent that the quality and quantity of ingredients have taken a hit. Beautiful buttery sauce is just oily and tasteless. I thought I was too critical last time but they won't get another chance with me. My lunch partner liked the eggplant parm ok but noticed there seems to be less each time they come here. The waiter was friendly enough but seemed to be phoning it in. Sad to see."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Being italian from NY, it is hard to find good Italian food. I am very pick! The fried calamari is not rubbery! Their bread is awesome! If you don't like Olive Garden, try this place!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great wonderful time at Macaroni.  We ordered the tasting menu which was so much fun, flavorful and exciting.  Would highly recommend it.  Kristin the manager came over to make sure everything was awesome and it was!!"}
{"text":"Staying nearby in Summerlin, we decided to stop by Macaroni Grill for an early lunch before a big dinner at the Strip. Probably dined at a Macaroni Grill on a business trip years ago, but I remembered the food was pretty good for a chain restaurant.  This location was in a strip mall so parking was a non-issue.  Checking in, the restaurant was at most half full, and we were promptly seated.  We were warmly greeted by our server Erin, who wrote her name on the paper table covering.  She then brought over a loaf of herb bread and olive oil as we checked out the menu.

After placing our orders, the food arrived after a short wait my order arrived:

Chicken Parmesan with Capellini - lunch portion.  The entree came in an iron skillet-like dish and Erin shredded fresh Parmesan on it.  The chicken was moist and tasty.  Good portion of Capellini came with the dish, though I prefer a thicker pasta like spaghetti.

After all these years, the food is still good.  It was a nice experience here and only wished they were closer to my home."}
{"text":"I remember when Macaroni Grill used to be one of the best places to eat not on the Strip....10 years ago. 

They have changed their menu some and now offer that special deal $25 bucks for 2 entrees and 2 tapas. We didn't order that as I wanted to order what I've been craving...my all time favorite, Penne Rustica! We decided to start off with the macaroni balls which were delish with the truffle oil. It wasn't busy at all for a Friday night, which was surprising to me, but I haven't been here in a couple years. My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti wasn't even spaghetti, it was all broken 1-2\" pieces of pasta. He said the sauce was flavorless and it wasn't enjoyable. My penne rustica was not what I remembered? The sauce was overpowering, chicken was dry and the penne was overcooked, I just didn't care for it. What a dissapointment! A 45 dollar dinner that wasn't even that delicious! 

Service was good, but I most likely won't be back. What a sad day since I used to love Macaroni Grill!"}
{"text":"5 stars for our awesome server Erin at the Rainbow location.  She was awesome very attentive, best server we've had ever."}
{"text":"I've been going here for ten years now and it only gets worse by the year.  Tonight was the crown of consistently smaller portions and badly cooked food.  I had the fruti Di Mar.  A disaster of inept cooking and brain dead management.  The pasta was cold, wasn't in hot water long enough.  It was everything that good pasta isn't.  The plate was served with dead unopened muscles, the ones that opened were like bubble gum, tasteless over cooked rubbery but not warm and no sauce.  The tiny scollops we cooked/!boiled to being tasteless and chewy.  The shrimp were very similarly over cooked chewy and tasteless.  Most fruti Di mar is made with a wine clam juice butter and lemon sauce with tomato and other veg.  This was made with pasta tomato sauce with some hot pepper, of course it was over cooked and dried out to a bitter taste.  The young cook needs training and severely warned about standards, the head chef needs to go back to the line, if he can't keep standards and lead to make consistent food he is useless and the GM needs to apply at Cracker Barrel where being aware of the food being served and pride of your organization isn't a requirement"}
{"text":"Terribly understaffed. Food ordered at reasonable time, but beverages were still not brought 25 minutes after being sat. Not exaggerating I was on an hour lunch break I was watching the clock. Can say much for the food because we had to leave before it was ready. May try for dinner but never again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food was delicious and our waitress was awesome (shoutout to Robin!) Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Great experience!
Our last visit here was one he most memorable in any restaurant. The server was very courteous, attentive to detail and also very helpful. The best service ever!
The complementary bread, balsamic vinegar and olive oil combo is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago when I received a coupon for the express dinner. It was a little confusing at first because we didn't know how it worked but a waitress explained it to us. I had the carbonara which was good. The manager on duty that night took really great care of us and made sure everything was to our liking. I really appreciated that. There is still a little confusion about dining in with the express menu like getting refills. Since you don't have a waitress, I'm not sure who you are supposed to ask. Also the tipping I was unsure about. I tipped but we did not get catered to like when having a regular waitress so I don't feel the tip should be 20%. The bread is $1 extra for the express menu which is a little
Annoying since most places when you order to go,
You get the bread for free."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with my family worst experience ever. This place has gone down hill. Our waitress was terrible I believe her name was Robin. They brought out cold stale bread. The waitress said I'll have new ones out for you, we never got them. Brought our entrees out without ever bringing our salads that we paid 3$ extra for and I asked her where's are salads? She said that's a good question. She went and grabbed them the lettuce was brown and old. I told her I didn't want no them she still charged for the salads. The service and food was terrible!!"}
{"text":"What a disaster!  If you like breaded chicken minus the chicken with a wonderful butter ( I mean literally melted butter) sauce than maybe this place is for you.   I only wish Yelp could provide negative stars so I can feel somewhat better about the dinner.

Gross."}
{"text":"I also wish I could give this dump a negative 5 stars. After seeing the ads on TV, my wife wanted to go there for her birthday dinner. First clue, very slow service. Second, we ordered same drink, an Italian Mojito. My wife's had a bright reddish color of something in the bottom, mine colorless. Point being, they should at least look the same. Server said he'd take care of it, which he did 15-20 minutes later. Apps weren't bad. Meatballs in a way hot sauce and something that looked worse than it tasted. Entrees were at best terrible. My chicken parm was flattened out to where it took up most of the plate. It was burned on the bottom, with very little cheese or sauce on it. My side of spaghetti was cold. Not just not hot or warm, cold. My wife ordered some shrimp pasta dish, not Alfredo. She told me shrimp was tough and had me try it. It was like eating wet cardboard. She didn't eat anymore of the shrimp but said the pasta thing tasted ok. She flagged down a manager and told her about the shrimp, and told her to go in the kitchen and try it. The manager said, No, I believe you and took it off the check. Our server came and just kept saying, Wow, I'm sorry, Wow, Hmmm, Sorry bout that, Wow, Hmmm, Wow, Sorry, Sorry Guys..Hmmmm. Anyway, I agree this place has seen better days and just needs to fade away. There was a total of 6 tables with other diners. Good concept but failing. Needless to say we will never go there again and for sure will tell all about our experience."}
{"text":"Just left from this location and I must say the service and food was amazing! Tulei was amazing. He was very attentive and very kind. Now a days so many businesses have lost the customer service side and every single time we come here... Amazing! Tulei thank you for your customer service. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Worst meals every. Meals took 2 and half hours. A roach crawling up the wall. The final blow was when my son moved his plate and a roach crawled on to his food. All of this happen last night as we came here for me grandson graduation"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and dinner with my husband, in-laws, & old boss. I've had the pizza (surprisingly good), sampled the Penne Rustica (my husband's favorite, very heavy), Eggplant Parmigiana (excellent, my favorite dish here), and Honey Balsamic Chicken (excellent). Recently the menu was changed, but still decent italian food at reasonable prices. I think that since we've been to Buca Di Beppo a few times, it's my husband's favorite italian place at the moment. 

Popular family restaurant with an elegant ambiance with both types of seating- booth & tables- also has butcher paper and crayons (ok it's not so elegant, but it can be entertaining). The service is usually pretty good. I heard that there is an opera singer performing on weekend nights, but I am guessing it is usually reserved for saturday nights. I almost forgot to mention the bread basket, and that the server mixes balsamic vinegar into the olive oil for you (good combo). If you ask, you will get seconds. 

Can be pretty busy at times, so if you're unsure, make reservations to avoid waiting. If you sign up on the e-club, you get free chocolate cake on your birthday."}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I went here for our one year anniversary and loved it! The staff was so nice, and our waitress was sweet. The butternut squash ravioli is delicious!"}
{"text":"Ive come here a couple times with my coworkers during lunchtime. The atmosphere is very nice. The tables have a white paper on them and they have crayons so you can draw on the table. Lol i ordered pizza and it was pretty good. The bad thing was that the food took like 30 min to come out so we almost didnt make it back to work on time. So come here with time to spare!"}
{"text":"Not enough staff is on hand the two times I have been in to properly pay attention to paying customers. I agree that the portions have shrunk over the years, and the effort is no longer there. It is convenient to have nearby but not worth my time when other great restaurants are around. Wish I could rate it better but it's just not that good at all."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!!!  Food was ok, but don't think we will be back.  They left a empty dirty salad bowl on our table for more than half an hour, gross!  Many servers and managers walked by with no notice of dirty dishes on tables,  we had to box up our own food,  and at no time did anyone offer me a second glass of wine!  Fail!!!  They also sat two well dressed adults in the kiddie section, really?!?!  It was not busy, early in the evening, and a full staff.  There is no excuse for such terrible service!  I wish I had  read the other reviews before we ate here.   After all these bad reviews you would think their corporate would get a clue or they just don't care either!   Lazy and apathetic is no way to go through life."}
{"text":"I like this place. I love right around the corner so we go every once and a while and I get it for lunch at work as well. Service is always great and super friendly! One time I ordered online and their was some electrical problem in the area so the place wasn't open BUT the manager that was there made my food anyways! How nice!!"}
{"text":"Positively one of the worst restaurant experiences we have had in the Las Vegas area. We asked for a white wine with our meal and the server James explained that the restaurant was in process of changing brands but they had nothing on the menu to offer our party, so we asked if we could sample one of the available brands, but the server had to refer us to the evening manager how said she was not able to offer us any other wine but we could purchase an entire bottle of the only Chardonnay left on the menu. We asked if she would be willing to let us taste? She said no. Then she said she would check the stock room to see if there were any wines that had been overlooked. She never returned to our table with any explanation. We went on with our meal but felt that we would never revisit this establishment again. We would much rather visit a restaurant that caters to the customers."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is amazing. The atmosphere is one of a kind. I get the Parmesan crusted sole with orzo. Now this is the only fish I will eat because I absolutely hate fish. Yes even tuna fish. But they have made it so delicious that its my number one go to. The chicken parm is great too. Wish they had different desert options."}
{"text":"We went to this mac grill and unlike the other ones I've been to this one was dirty and the food wasn't good. The table was bent and our drinks were about to fall on the floor and the floor was so sticky my feet stuck to the ground. I wouldn't recommend this location."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The service was sucky. The waitress was super slow and it irritates me when people bring out kids meals like 20 minutes before the adults. You have to try to talk and entertain your kid while trying to eat. 

When i finally got a second drink at the end of the meal after being on empty for most of the meal she brought me diet instead of regular. Yuck!  The worst taste in the world is taking a big gulp of the wrong drink."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with a group of my sorority sisters for an annual luncheon. There were eleven of us and the restaurant only had about three other table of smaller parties. Sadly, our service wasn't the best, It seemed as if the restaurant was packed when really it wasn't. I 'm not a fan of having to search around the restaurant for my waitress after my drink had been empty for a few minutes. 
It also didn't help that when our waitress finally brought our refills she smelled them because she couldn't remember which one was coke or dr. pepper.  Was not a pleasant sight to see.

The food was tasty, not my favorite, but I believe the lack of service made a difference its hard to truly enjoy food when you are dying for drink in between bites."}
{"text":"For every one 1 star for this place, the customer must have been having a bad day and pissed at the world!! My waitress Sky was awsoume!! The portions was very good, an when we needed something she was in an out with whatever we needed an got to enjoy a good meal!! Definitely one of my favorite places an will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible experience.  We sat down and waiting about 10 minutes for someone to greet us.  Eventually we got the option to order and they were out of all of the soups so we ordered a prosciutto and cheese appetizer.  It showed up so burnt it charcoal around the edges and frankly didn't have a lot of flavor.   The pasta was bland and over salted and the manager never brought us the bread we asked for.  Overall it reminded us why we never go there."}
{"text":"Seriously how does this place not have 5 stars?? Omg it is so good with fabulous happy hour deals. My parents come here all the time and sit at the bar. I went with them last night. Our bartender Erica was awesome. :) The entire bartending staff greeted me when I walked in as I was waiting for my parents. They told me about their happy hour deals and showed me their house wine. During happy hour from 5-7pm the bottle is half off for only $15. It's a big bottle too. Or you can get a glass of it for $3!!! They have a heavy pour too which is an added bonus!

On top of half off bottles of wine, (all their bottles are half off) their flat bread pizzas are only $5 and they're HUGE. You can pick between cheese or pepperoni. I had the parmesan crusted chicken salad and it was seriously delicious. I ate every last bite! I can't wait to come back again and again during these amazing happy hour deals. My parents ordered the flat bread pizza and it was reallyyy good. I might be tempted to even come here for take out since the price is so great.

Overall, you can't go wrong coming here. The place was packed and I can see why. Excellent service, drinks and food! Conveniently located across the street from the Great Northern mall too. I LOVE IT. Stop in !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can understand why this restaurant has a 2 1/2 star rating.  The food was not good at all.  It may have been an off day but nonetheless I was very disappointed as I used to frequent the Hawaii location when I used to live there.  I am not sure why there was inconsistency in the way the food tasted.  I'm a creature of habit and normally order Chicken Marsala wherever I go.  I've always enjoyed this dish especially at Macaroni Grill but not today.  It was missing a lot of flavor and then some.  It just wasn't appetizing at all.  We opted out on bringing home leftovers.  How disappointing."}
{"text":"I was sorely disappointed with our recent dinner visit...
The service was good, but the prices went up & portions got smaller.
The ingredients we lacking in my \"make your own pasta\"...
I figured if I ordered \"make your own...\", it would be pretty much made to order. But, that didn't seem like the case.
The pasta portion was smaller than my niece's children's spaghetti & meatball dish, it was suppose to have roasted garlic, there were 2 pieces, and sun dried tomatoes, there was none-just a few diced tomato pieces.

Just not what is expected from a restaurant that is suppose to be all about the pasta!"}
{"text":"Had my daughters birthday dinner here today. I'm usually not a fan of Italian chain restaurants, but I have to say the food wasn't bad! Lobster Ravioli in freshly rolled pasta dough, what!?!? True. 5 adult entrees, 1 child , a bottle of wine. Only 104.00! And Camal, our waiter was fantastic! He really was on top of his game."}
{"text":"We've moved away from chain restaurants due to the lack of service we typically receive.  I almost felt judged by the server because we weren't dressed up.  I mean, we were in jeans and t-shirts, but didn't look like bums.  The food was terrible too.  The server seemed annoyed that he had to bring us extra calamari sauce and was difficult to find.  They claim their pasta is homemade and \"al dente\", but really it was just undercooked.  I've had fresh pasta before and never had it served so hard, or sticking together.  I doubt we'll ever come back."}
{"text":"Nice place!  Great service.  Terrible chicken marsella that should be taken off the menu and its been my fav dish there forever. 

The staff provided apologies and replaced my fav with a wonderful seafood dish.  I wont be ordering any more chicken dishes there for awhile.

Randy offered delightful humor knowing that laughter and caring goes a long way to please a customer.  Good for him and good for the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to macaroni grill (this location) several time over the years and it's OK. The service is always great but the food is a hit or miss most of the time. 

lasagna 4/5 stars 
pasta was tender and the sauce was flavorful but not enough sauce and cheese in the dish, it was kinda dry between the layers. 

Cannelloni 2/5 
The filling has changed over the years and the new changes I do not care for. It's dry in the inside and I had to order extra sauce on the side to make it worth eating. The flavors are there but the filling is extremely dry. So sad because it's my favorite dish at this restaurant. Well...it was..."}
{"text":"Tonight my wife and I came for dinner. I tried the Seafood Linguini which was new on the menu. It had scallops, shrimp and clams and was very flavorful. My wife had the Scallop Salad which was also excellent. Always enjoy our dining experience there. They also have the best Chianti...$30 for a bottle which I'll get for her birthday."}
{"text":"I had several restaurants on my mind: Flo's, Elephant Bar and at the last minute decided to go to Macaroni Grill at around 6 PM. The parking lot was full, all the tables on the patio were occupied so I dropped my wife off to put our name in.  After parking, I walked into the restaurant and she wasn't there, they had all ready seated her. We sat in a couples booth and could watch the cooks and waiters picking up their orders.  We ordered the stuff mushrooms, but after a long wait our waitress came by and told us they had to start a new batch. She asked if we still wanted them, of course not. I'm glad she asked, 'cause we all ready had our fill of their delicious bread. 
My wife ordered the house wine, 1/2 insalata , Margherita pizza and I had the Shrimp Portofino which looked small but very filling.
Our waitress, Jess, was a little slow in bringing us a take home box and the check, but was friendly."}
{"text":"Worst Valentine's Day dinner ever. They were doing a special for the holiday which entailed an appetizer, two entrees and dessert for $45. Knowing this place is on the expensive side for me and my boyfriend, we thought that was a pretty good deal. We ordered mac n cheese bites for the appetizer; I ordered fettuccine alfredo; my boyfriend ordered the rosemary ribeye steak; and we ordered tiramisu for dessert.

We waited about 45 minutes for our dinner, which was fine. We didn't mind waiting (at least for what we hoped was going to be good quality food). Mac n cheese bites were bland. Literally lacked all spices including the basic salt and pepper. No flavor at all. It also came with a \"white truffle dip\" which I didn't try but my boyfriend did and he described it as a \"disgusting spicy mayo-like sauce.\" When our entrees came out, his steak was literally charred to a crisp (which he ordered medium rare!). The sauce on my fettuccine alfredo seemed to have seized or something -- it was that awful glue/pasty-like texture. We decided to give them a chance with dessert. Tiramisu tasted like it just came out of the freezer. It was still partially frozen and it was soggy (as in the plate literally had a puddle under the tiramisu). It was disgusting. None of it even looked appetizing (see photos attached).

Sadly, our waitress was amazing and we left her a generous tip and noted that it wasn't her that we were upset with. We talked with the manager who comped our entire bill (there was absolutely no way I was ever going to pay or allow my boyfriend to pay $54 for such a crappy meal that we didn't even eat!). Not to mention, we weren't the only table complaining -- tables around us were complaining about the service and again, the quality of food. One couple was furious about the \"spicy mayo dip\" that came with the mac n cheese bites too!

Needless to say, we won't ever be coming back here."}
{"text":"Went to Macaroni Grill on 12/21 to celebrate my sons 20th birthday.  Arrived and no one was there to greet us.  Waited a few minutes and then the hostess took our name.  Will waiting for our seat, I noticed the women at the To Go stand checking her phone.  Waited about 20 minutes and was seated.  Noticed a whole section that the tables were empty.  Ordered our meal.  My husband and I ordered a Caesar salad with no Caesar dressing and balsamic vinegar on the side. When salads came we received a different salad. Didn't say anything, we just ate it.  We all order whole wheat pasta.  They all came out hard.  Mine was clumpy like you didn't cook it for very long.  Told the waitress and she said that is how they have to cook whole wheat pasta so it won't be mush.  She asked if we wanted another pasta and I asked for regular pasta.  Mine came with my meal.  My son didn't finish his pasta.  My husband, son, and I ordered sausage.  Will I was tasting my pasta, my son ate a piece of the sausage. He looked at the other piece and asked if it was raw.  Clearly it was raw in the middle. I cut mine open and mine was raw.  My husbands was a little pink.  My son asked to see a manager.  In the mean time, the waitress came back and asked if everything was alright.  We showed her the sausage, she apologized and took one plate.  The chef came out and apologized and offered something else.  He offered us shrimp.  We ordered that and also noticed my son did not finish his pasta.  Offered to make another.  We received the shrimp and it was over cooked.  When we received our bill, one dinner was removed.  We paid for our dinner and left.  The manager was at the front door and said good night.  In all my life, I have never returned a meal.  I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"First let me say I usually hate chain restaurant food. It all seems cheap and is almost always over cooked. But this place Completely surprised me. 

It was my little sisters sweet 16 birthday dinner. After calling numerous restaurants Macaroni Grill was the only one willing and able to accommodate 27 people. Upon arrival we were assured by multiple members of the staff how grateful they were we chose them and how they'd like to make this a memorable experience. Considering the disaster from the year before we were all a bit nervous. They setup a table in a back room with a board featuring my sister's name and wishing her a happy birthday. 

We had two servers assigned to our party I can't remember the ladies name but our male servers name was Caleb and he was a doll. Extremely knowledgeable, answering all of our questions without attitude and being very attentive. 

Everyone's food came out correct and tasted amazing. I had the Penne Rustica which was to die for and my wife had the Pollo Caprese both dishes were tasty. They both came with salads, we got the dressing on the side. A few in our party said theirs were overdressed but not to the point of being inedible. My wife also drank a blood orange Italian soda (no  refills) but it was yummy. Dinner was followed by chocolate cake for my sister and servers singing Happy birthday. 

All and all this was an amazing experience and we will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"The last three times I've eaten at Macaroni Grill the service has been terrible! Two hours for lunch for 5 people Is way too long. Today the signature bread was cold, the olive oil bottles on the table were empty, and the calamari I ordered came out lukewarm, soggy and greasy.  I spoke with the manager, she was apologetic and that was it.  There is not a chance that I will be back."}
{"text":"Are server never came after 30 mins of waiting and the plates we were dirty like someone used them then wiped it off with a paper towel. We were told are server name is Robin but we never got to meet her since she never came to take are orders. The chairs were dirty and sticky we had to clean it with a baby wipe."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick dinner on a weeknight and I decided to let the husband pick the restaurant. A good option for a meal that is quick and inexpensive.

It was easy to get a table during the week and it was indeed the quick meal we were seeking. I love that the menu lists out calorie counts to help me make a better choice. Our waitress was friendly and there weren't any delays in getting the food to the table. 

The bread was as good as I remembered with delicious olive oil for dipping. The Caesar salad that came with my meal was a little boring, but not bad. It was just lettuce covered in Caesar dressing. For my meal I had Chicken Marsala. This was a decent option and was a lighter option since the chicken isn't breaded."}
{"text":"We had the most awkward waiter ever. He was very unsure of himself and it showed . The kitchen staff stood at the counter bs'ing with our waiter while our food sat on the counter. When we finally got out food it tasted old and rubbery. Complained to management and they took care of the check, but what a crap experience."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to go into Macaroni Grill on a Thursday night about 6pm. I have 3 children, so this is a treat for us. We sat down and the hostess said she would be right back with crayons, which I had to go get myself after we realized they weren't coming. We ordered 2 appetizers, macaroni bites and bruscheta. The bites were good but the toast  for the bruscheta came out noticeably burnt, something the chef or server should have noticed. The server took our order and we had to asked twice for the wine list. My 2 young children got their food first. It was fine. Then my husband and oldest got their food. My husband took one bite out of his pork shank cremini and the only thing hot was the sauce. He told the server it was cold so he took it back to the kitchen. About 10 minutes later we both received our meals. My meal was ok, not hot but warm and yes my husband's was still cold. He sent back the food and didn't reorder anything else because by this time my kids were almost done. The experience was not good. Food and service needs much improvement!"}
{"text":"I remember this chain being OK long ago in the past, even if very inconsistent.  However, this was the worst and poorest experience I ever had at any branch.  The food was horrible and flavorless, and the service and kitchen staff couldn't have delivered less.  I could even see how slow motion, uninspired, and sloppy the kitchen staff was thanks to the open kitchen concept.

I asked for some marinara sauce on the side and they had the nerve to serve me totally cold uncooked sauce. I think the customers are luckly if they do not get sick eating here.

I only hope writing this review reminds me to never go back to any Macaroni Grill ever again.  I definitely would never return to this one!  A one star rating can not even properly reflect how bad this restaurant is...  How do they remain in business?"}
{"text":"Today was our date day so we decided to try Macaroni Grill again. Years and years ago they served Nachos we loved them. Today when we entered most of the employees we younger but I asked our server if he had heard of the Nachos they used to make. Jose stated no but he went and got another older employee. She came to our table and later we found out that she was an executive chef and now the Gm. She said of course I do. We talked a moment about them.  She stated I can make you some. It was kind of funny how all the other employees watched as she made them.  They were just like we had remember. They were awesome.  Thank you Kristen Bonkavich for making this day special.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant layout and looked like everyone in our party of 15, who ordered Italian food enjoyed their meal.  I made mistake of ordering the lamb chops - way over priced for such little amount of meat.  I like lamb, but when going to an Italian Restaurant, I should have gone with a pasta meal."}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill is a good solid restaurant chain.  Their bread is good, their salads are good, their pastas are good & you can order them with what you want in them.  

I have only one problem with their food.  It is all very high in fat content & calories.  You are going above your daily requirement of 50-60 grams of fat per day if you eat here; therefore this restaurant is a \"splurge\".  If I'm going to blow a day in eating good food, is this what I'm going to blow it on?  I don't think so."}
{"text":"We walked in and the manager looked at us three times and walked away. This place is awful. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Slow service, although nice. Forgot to bring our drinks back and servings took awhile in between. Singing waitress walking around to entertain was awesome! Food was sitting under a lamp for a whole before it came out. Fetechini was bland, but the penne Rustica was yummy! Kids spaghetti was excellent."}
{"text":"New Mediterrean Menu and classics like their Twice Baked Lasagna are BACK!!! @MacaroniGrill 

Rolling solo I decided to sit in the bar and watch the game, drin k a beer and grab a little something to eat. This place is a little fancy but very inviting and all the servers from the hostess to the waitress to the bartender to the manager are FANTASTIC!!

I decided to order some Tomato Bruschetta with  grilled, rustic focaccia bread and also Lasagna Al Forno-Twice baked lasagna layered with authentic Bolognese meat sauce, ricotta and mozzarella. Topped with imported Italian tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil.

After just a few moments the bartender came back with my beer and a platter of Prosciutto e Parmigiano-(Imported Italian prosciutto and aged Parmigiano Reggiano served with fig jam) AND a  COMPLIMENTARY hot loaf w/olive oil and fresh ground black pepper.

Watching the game drinking a beer and eating some bread with proscuitto,cheese,and olive oil I was loving life waiting on my appetizer and entree to come out thinking I ordered WAY too much food NOT knowing they brought all this out for each table-for a family YES but one guy in the bar-I thought I was getting the VIP treatment. I mean that FIG JAM was outstanding!!!

After about 10 minutes the bartender refilled my beer and brought out my Lasagna with extra sauce!! At that moment it hit me-I said Brushetta he heard Prosciutto?!?! I wasn't gonna be seeing any tomatoes tonight ...

BUT no biggie the proscuitto platter was GREAT and the Lasagna was WOW!! I can't believe they took this off the menu at one time?!?

I need to find out if they have a happy hour!! Loving this place again even though they screwed up my order:)"}
{"text":"Disappointed again.  It had been a few years since we were last at Romano's Macaroni Grill, since we have been swept off our feet by the many other great Italian restaurants around, but the 2-tapas and 2 entrees for $25 enticed us back for another try.  It's a good deal but the chef attention was not in evidence.  You have your choice of 6 tapas or 8 entrees, and can choose from any of the regular entrees for $3 more.  At happy hour the drinks are also a bargain. Though the Margarita Prima was a bit sour for my taste, it may be just right for some.

The highlight of the meal was the bread.  The ciabatta delivered with our drinks was as good as they get.  From there, it was all downhill.  The concepts were great, but the flavor was completely lacking.  

Our tapas, the artichoke potato cakes and zucchini fritti were generic fried pub food lacking any Italian imagination.

I had the pasta carbonara, which looked wonderful, and the poached egg on top is the perfect touch, but there was no flavor whatsoever to the sauce.  Even the pancetta lacked flavor.  Having just returned from Italy where I had some really great carbonara, I was completely let down.  My wife had Carmela's chicken, in which we could find no hint of the advertised carmelized onion, and the chicken tasted as though it had been processed to death and butchered weeks ago.

Fortunately, I was able to revive my taste buds with a good chocolate gelato before departing leaving half-empty plates and no desire for a doggy bag."}
{"text":"I'm a big pasta guy, can probably eat it every night of the week if it were a more slimming dish. But I'm usually not a big fan of the chain Italian places i.e. Olive Garden and here. But after a long relationship with Olive Garden and their more than average prices for their less than average food. We stopped here for a change. It's the same old stuff, pasta, meats, salads, seafood. I used to never want to come here because I thought it was way more expensive than Olive Garden but I was wrong, I was able to find more of what I like for less of a price. 

I'm only recommending this place if you have thought of everything and nothing sounds good enough or close enough to drive. But I'll take it over Olive Garden any day."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have good reviews and I understand why. We walked in and waited about 5-7 minutes just to be given water. There were so many employees standing around chatting too and so many empty tables. Our server finally came around and she was training a new employee. Both were very nice and genuine. Unfortunately, they forgot our wine for about 10 minutes and then when we reminded them the lead server said \"oh one of my co-workers is getting it\" which translated to us as \"that is not my job.\" The food was decent but nothing amazing. 
Also, the surrounding area has a sewage smell that needs to be fixed. It's definitely not the restaurants fault, but it needs to be tended to."}
{"text":"Came in last Monday around 530pm, there was only 2 other tables of people there so I figured we would of got our food fast, couldn't of been more wrong.  Took 20 minutes just to get us bread to the table and it must of been from 2 weeks ago since I have had fresher bread at 4th Ave jail, after that it took another 30 minutes to get our food, my wife's chicken parmigiano was not only burnt and tasteless but it was also cold, my food was also cold as well, will never return to this or any other Romanos restaurant not worth the time or hassle"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero star I would. First, I never write reviews but this experience is unacceptable. Currently, our table has been waiting for almost two hours for our food order only for the server to report back my entree is unable to be made, even though I explicitly advised my allergies upon ordering. Furthermore our table was waiting so long part of our party left because of the terribly long wait. We've had multiple dirty glasses given to our party, had to get up and serve ourselves for water, bread, pepper. Upon describing the above to the manager, he did nothing! We are the only people in the restaurant by the way. This is absolutely THE WORST service ever!!!! PS. An 1.5 hours into this fun ordeal the manager finally offered a bottle of wine--little too late dude you should have offered this back when the 2nd bottle we attempted to order was out of stock. Update: to top it off our bill was completely wrong and the manager apparently left because he was nowhere in sight."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and had a horrible time! I've never been to a macaroni grill but have worked in the food industry long enough to know what good service is.... the server neglected us...multiple other tables who arrived after received their orders before us...And when our food did finally come the it was barely warm and my friend recieved the wrong sandwich...we called the manager over to voice our concerns only to be scolded him. He did comp our meal....but our overall experience was terrible! Needless to say they've definitely lost our business."}
{"text":"Very unhappy. Chicken parm was awful (tasteless.) Wont  go back. Service wasn't to bad considering it was dinner rush. Too many good little family owned Italian places in the area"}
{"text":"We had dinner here and although service was good ; we all had stomach issues next day so not sure of quality ; may be this branch has issue as I had lunch in desert ridge mall branch earlier"}
{"text":"Every single dish was fantastic and we had a lot of them.  Stuffed mushrooms, roasted asparagus, lobster ravioli, lasagna bolognese, and Dover sole!!  All great!!"}
{"text":"I'll only come back here if someone invents a time machine to travel back 10 years ago.  Just wasn't impressed with my entire meal.  The bread use to be amazing, the quality use to be great & service has lacked luster as well.  I tried"}
{"text":"Chicken milanese(used to be our favorite) was DRY and only cooked on ONE side...brocolini was hard as a rock. We never saw a manager the entire time we were there and the server couldn't have cared less when we pointed out the food wasn't up to par. I emailed them and of course they never bothered to respond.

If you want  a fabulous dinner...you might want to go elsewhere"}
{"text":"We arrived with a  large party and was assured they could handle us all. The first batch of food started coming out about an hour and ten minutes after ordering. And continued to come out in small 2 or 3 plate batches for the next 45 minutes. They brought the young kids food last out of all the meals.  Only part of my food came to the table. II was told the potatoes would be coming right out. Right out must mean after the check has arrived and we had paid the bill.  Our waiter was nice but was over loaded. And to top it off he was surrounded by rude employees who refused to help him out. Pretty sad for a chain restaurant really."}
{"text":"I. Have. No. Words.

What an awkward and unfortunate dining experience. One of my girlfriends had a gift card here and invited me out for dinner and drinks so I met her and another friend at this Macaroni Grill location. I've never been to a Macaroni Grill and did not have any expectations.

I walked in the restaurant to a hostess facing the opposite direction of the door around 7ish. I stared at the back of her head for a solid minute before I realized she did not plan to turn around. I said hello and she turned around, looked surprised, smiled and grabbed some menus. I asked for a booth for 3 people which she had available.

When my friends arrived they joined me at the booth and we quickly scanned the wine menu for a bottle to share. We asked for the Chateau St. Michelle Riesling. Our server, Shelly, came back to let us know they didn't have any chilled bottles but could place one in ice for us. We declined and ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. She came back with a bottle of Kendall Jackson (not what we asked for) and offered us this alternative as they didn't have in stock the Chardonnay we ordered. My friend asked if she was able to price match the original Chardonnay we ordered ($10 difference) and she left to double check and let us know she could. We had to also request for water and bread as we were getting hungry. 

We started off with the \"NEW\" appetizer item, loaded fries, and the macaroni bites. We got 2 loaves of warm bread with olive oil and balsamic which was probably the best part of our meal. When we ordered our apps we asked to order our entrees as well and Shelly told us not yet as she had to assist another table and came by a few minutes after. 

It took 45 minutes after we were seated for our apps to come out. As Shelly placed the Mac and Cheese bites on our table, half of the sauce spilt onto the table. She quickly apologized, placed the fries on the table, and left to get us more sauce. The loaded fries looked far from loaded topped with a cheesy white liquid and a few thin slices of red peppers. I remember seeing prosciutto on the menu with the loaded fries. Not only did were the fries missing the prosciutto (which Shelly brought out for us in a separate bowl when we asked about it) but we asked for a menu and saw it was also was missing the Gorgonzola and Parmesan. Once we brought this to Shelly's attention she was apologetic and we overheard her asking the chef if he even knew how to make the fries. (The cooking line where the food came out was right next to our table).

The Mac and Cheese bites were unmemorable. We picked at the fries since we were starving and eventually when Shelly came back to our table we told her that it wasn't necessary to bring out another loaded fries. One of my friends and I ordered side Caesar salads which weren't bad and my other friend got the tomato basil soup. This soup was literally a bowl of marinara sauce. The thick consistency looked like marinara or a can of tomato sauce. I told him to dip the left over bread in it. 

Eventually our food came out. My friend got garlic shrimp Alfredo which tasted ok! My other friend got the Buffalo Chicken Parmesan which literally looked and tasted like it was microwaved to get the cheese melted on top. The breaded chicken was soggy which once again made me believe this was microwaved or sitting out for a while. I ordered the classic bake per the server's recommendation and they brought out this tray that could feed a small family of 3. One bite and I couldn't eat the rest. The noodles tasted like they were sitting out for hours (or days) and there was something strange and sour about the tomato sauce. 

Shelly was nice and offered complimentary dessert for our experience. We politely declined as we wanted to leave and she also brought us the boxed loaded fries they had made (that we did not want). She boxed the Shrimp Alfredo and the Chicken Parm for my friends and I declined boxing up my family portion of classic bake as I had no interest eating this at home. She could clearly see I did not touch the entree but did not ask questions and came back with our bill. 

We did not want to be a nuisance but really could not believe the series of unfortunate events that happened throughout our meal and also how terrible the food quality and taste was. I spoke up and said I really did not like the classic bake and Shelly left to bring over her manager, Ryan. Ryan told us and he watched our entire dining experience and understands how negative it was and also saw me barely try the classic bake (where was he earlier?) and would take care of the classic bake and the fries. We thanked him and he gave a small apology. 

My friend who ate the tomato basil/marinara sauce got a bad stomach ache when we left the restaurant. Please do not eat here."}
{"text":"Had takeout and not in press. Ordered chicken parmesan and eggplant Parmesan. Eggplant was good but the pasta was over cooked and no sauce. 
Same goes for the chicken parmesan and over priced.
Sorry but I will not be back"}
{"text":"Appetizer - terrific!
Meals were so-so.
Dessert wonderful!

We were lulled into expecting a great meal having just enjoyed Macaroni Grill's freshly baked ciabatta bread.  And, our appetizer of stuffed mushrooms was excellent  - flavorful and a bit spicy, not the usual crabmeat but instead a filling of sausage, goat cheese and spinach - a generous dish.

As for the main dishes, our server assured us that we were making good choices - our mistake in believing her.  In the past we've enjoyed our Macaroni Grill meals.  This visit I had the Pan Seared Branzino - a tasteless grilled whitefish served over arugula.  It lacked any flavor, even the requested extra sauce didn't help.  My lunch buddy's Pesto Spaghetti was bland, nothing special.  

We ended the meal with an absolutely delicious Ghiradelli chocolate cake warm from the oven.  Quality chocolate really does make a difference.  This was a cake to die for!  It was beautifully presented along with a small bowl of hot chocolate and whipped cream.  

This dessert almost made up for our very mediocre and somewhat pricey main dishes.  I think a future visit may be for cake only!"}
{"text":"We went there because they were listed as a restaurant with a gluten free menu. But they do not have gluten free menu.  They hand you a Allergen sheet and you have to order your food with modifications, now i have to trust kitchen help not cross contaminate my food.  I have dairy allergy too so I will not be coming back here.  if you need gliuten free do not choose Macaroni grill."}
{"text":"Good Macaroni Grill.  Small and nit far from the strip.  Good service and food came out quickly and hot.  Only thing was my wife's salad usually has more chicken and this one they didn't put Pine nuts on."}
{"text":"Last night I attended this Macaroni grill and I was disgusted by their customer service. I was harassed by my server who is named Tony. Now, I understand we were in a Henderson which is almost like the Beverly Hills of Las Vegas and the people there were dressed business casual but that gave him no right to treat me like SHIT! I may have tattoos and I might not have been suited and booted like these older folks but I had just enough money as them in my wallet and I am a big tipper. He gave me a dirty look when I declined the wine and ordered beer instead. He repeatedly came back and tried to remove my plate from the table while I was still eating and had a mouth full. It is such a shame that I was treated that way and that one employee made the whole restaurant look like a shit hole I will never go back there again nor will I recommend it and I will definitely tell ALL of my friends and family members in Las Vegas, Summerlin, and Henderson not to ever step foot in this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome.  The entire menu is delectable.  This one in Phoenix was the first Macaroni Grill I'd been to, but I've since been to locations in Pensacola, Chattanooga, and Orlando.  All of them are consistently excellent.  It's fun and family-friendly (your waiter will write his name on your paper tablecloth in crayon, upside down so that you can read it, then leave the crayons for you to go crazy with).

Also, they leave a bottle of house wine at your table and then charge you by the glass, using the honor system (though I'd imagine if you finished the bottle and claimed one glass they'd catch on).  Add this to my list of places I wish were near me, but sort of glad they aren't because I'd be a lot poorer if they were!"}
{"text":"The lunch is perfect portions here. Got the 3 course lunch and it was so good. Ravioli with vodka sauce was perfect!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Mediocre service.  Enough said. No need to return for overpriced, chain food."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today and the food is good. The service is very good and the place is clean. The prices are about $11 to $15 a meal, but lunch portions go for about $7.50. It is a good place for a business lunch or to meet friends in which you won't go wrong by eating here."}
{"text":"I hate to give a low rating but this place was slow to seat, slow to get our order, slow to get our drinks. Ran out of the wine I ordered after waiting 15 minutes for it. Had to ask 3 times for a knife. One star because the food was good."}
{"text":"Buyer beware--Romano's Macaroni Grill has changed their menu (and not for the better).  They still have the old menu on-line and show pictures of food on their site that no longer exist.  We went for the chicken parmesan that was excellent in the past. Now you can order a small portion or full portion of any of the pasta but there is NO salad included if you order the full portion.  Everything is now ala carte.  The quantity and quality of the chicken is not what we have come to expect.  They have already closed the restaurant on Sahara (across from the Palace Station) and who knows when this will follow.  This will be our last visit to Macaroni Grill.  It's a shame because we were regular diners in the past."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Macaroni Grill location but my other relatives have been to other locations in New Jersey so we came here based on their good experiences.

The ambience inside the restaurant is nice with exposed bricks, white table cloths with brown paper on top to draw on, nice lighting and music softly playing in the background during our visit. I wouldn't say that the atmosphere was romantic as it seems to be a popular choice for families - basically reminiscent of Alice Fazooli's restaurants.

Their complimentary bread with a bit of parmesan cheese (I think) and some butter was good. I tried the truffle mac and cheese, which was a really good blend of different types of cheese and it was very rich in flavour. It was a good portion for $16 - I took the other half home and it was still tasty the next day! My other family members ordered the eggplant parmesan, shrimp scampi, prosciutto pizza and steak. All were happy with how their orders tasted. 

My mom was the one exception because her alfredo pasta had little sauce. Our wonderful waiter made sure to bring it back to the kitchen to make sure the problem was resolved. It was a bit funny to see the dish come back swimming in sauce to the point where it looked like soup but we figured that the pasta would absorb it anyway when reheated tomorrow!

Overall, good food (not over the top amazing though), good portions and good prices. Also, amazing service from our waiter who seemed to be genuinely kind, helpful, constantly checked in with our group of 8, and he had an overall happy demeanor that was refreshing. Definitely a good experience here!

It only gets 3 stars from me though because while my family had a good meal here, I wouldn't consider this a foodie place nor would it be a \"must try when you're in Phoenix\" type of place. Our experience here was a good one for a chain restaurant but again, there are also many places to try in Phoenix that are more unique and would have more of a \"wow\" factor."}
{"text":"I would never have set foot into a Macaroni Grill - which I went to only once in New Jersey before most of you young Yelpersnappers were born - had it not been for one of those \"have a free dinner on us\" presentations that try to suck your money out of you.  We went because the hosts claimed they weren't selling anything.  And, hey, you can't beat free.

So I was pleasantly surprised when we were led to a comfortable table in a kinda private part of the restaurant, where we were given set menus to choose our dinners from.  I verified later that these were regular menu items, not some rubber chicken specials thrown together à la tour groups.

A nice salad was followed by our entrees, Shrimp Portofino for me and the Grilled Salmon for my husband.  I was surprised by the abundance of meaty shrimp in the pasta dish, together with spinach and fresh mushrooms, and both were perfectly cooked.  The only flaw was the complete absence of the touted pignoli.  When I asked our wonderful waitress about it later, she said she'd noticed it, too, and had asked the chef if they were in the dish.  \"He said 'yeah, two.' \"  Two pine nuts?  I must have missed 'em, and they didn't make an appearance in the leftover pasta I had the next night.

The salmon was awesome.  I would have ordered it - it was highly recommended by the waitress - except the menu said it came with \"sun-dried tomato orzo,\" and I'm not wild about sun-dried tomatoes.  But when I tasted it, I couldn't believe how fantastic it was, and now I want to go back and order the salmon.

Even the coffee - freshly brewed just for me - was excellent, and I'm really picky about my coffee.  

My dessert was the pitcher of milk accidently spilled on me by the otherwise-terrific waitress, on a brand-new shirt, of course.  But that wasn't enough to mar a serendipitously delicious dinner.  The pine nuts, on the other hand..."}
{"text":"09/09/10

2.5 stars!

I'd acquired a gift card, so we decided to have an early dinner here before catching a show at AMC.  I asked if complimentary bread was available.  The server said it was, and would we like some olives w/ it?  \"Sure!,\" we chimed.  Rosemary focaccia w/ olives tasted wonderful, although the olives were, naturally, very salty.  Were we told that the olives would cost extra, we probably would've passed on the suggestion (since my Mom isn't gaga over olives due to their saltiness).  I'd recently added eggplant to my diet, so I was on an eggplant kick.  We therefore had to try the eggplant parmigiana, which came w/ capellini pasta and a side salad.  I also wanted to try their spinach salad w/ blue cheese.  I don't know, but whenever I read \"candied walnuts\" in an entree's description, I just have to order it!

The side salad was a lot bigger than any side salad I've ever encountered before; it was big enough to satisfy us until the main entree arrived, but there was the extra insalata blu to contend w/.  It was good, but we both favored the side Caesar salad.  The dressing was just perfect for the amount of greens present.  The eggplant parmigiana was a big disappointment!  My first two bites were a mix of eggplant, pasta, and cheese, and I found the combo to be very bland.  I then tried the eggplant and the cheese on its own, and I was dumbstruck to find that the eggplant tasted like the cheese, and vice-versa!  Even the pasta tasted the same as the veggie and the cheese.  I tried the part where the server added parmesan cheese, and there was no added flavor there, either!  Since I did not find satisfaction w/ the entree, I started craving for something sweet-- the vanilla gelato w/ strawberries was the answer :)  Mom didn't care for this dish, but no worries!  More for me!!

The best thing out of our experience at Macaroni Grill that afternoon was that when the main entree was delivered, our server had automatically split the entree onto two plates WITHOUT OUR HAVING TO ASK!  This simple act impressed us both and garnered this review an extra star :)

I'd like to give MG another chance, but w/ so many great non-chain Italian restaurants in the valley, I'll find it hard to justify going back so soon."}
{"text":"pure garbage service.... came in at 3:05pm to take advantage of the $7 in 7 min. our host, which was also our waiter told us that he cant guarantee the meal to be ready in 7 min!?!?!   on a sat. at 3pm the restaurant is DEAD and its YOUR special, but you cant gurantee?!!?  stupid!

also our waiter, who didnt write his name on the table...(which is like the signature restaurant move) had the emotions of us being a bother to him. he didnt pick up the empty plates, just left everything there, see the pic. i finally got stephan's name from the receipt.  must be nice to be lazy at your job! this place lost our business...as you know there are MANY restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Horrible atmosphere, waiters left dirty dishes on one of the three islands/pantry in the middle of the restaurant. (Which is weird enough....that you can see opened very cans of soda and cut up lime and lemons that have been sitting out for who knows how long). Horrible service. Horrible attitude waiters. Would never go back. I am surprised that this chain has not been shut down."}
{"text":"Good food, prices like the rest of them, decent portions.  Personally I think it is better than Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Service was stupendous. Tania was a great server, she was attentive, nice and on it! I have to say though the food wasn't as good as I had. The bread was hard and stale. The calamari was ok and my dinner wasn't good at all. The chicken was too salty and the penne was over cooked and too soft. I feel like the quality of food has gone down since the last time I was there. My boys had the ravioli and meat ball and the meatballs were a little dry but the raviolis were good and the tomato sauce was great! I also ordered the chocolate cake and that was dry too. I'm so disappointed in the food we ate tonight. The only thing that was great and enjoyable was our server, Tania was great. The food was so disappointing."}
{"text":"I generally write reviews after eating at a restaurant, or staying at a hotel. This time, I would just like to write a review about what is going on on the other side of the business. My wife recently worked for this restaurant as a server, and to say that they treated her like a servant. After a couple of weeks of ridiculous training (including more homework than college), she was then put to work. The shifts were short at first, but she was able to make some decent tips. She said that the managers were in the process of changing everything. The menu, the way of service, etc. Long story short, eventually the managers were having my wife and other employees cleaning the restaurant after their shifts because they fired the cleaning crew. The shifts were cut to almost nothing. The reason these other reviews are so bad is because this is a company in disarray. They treat their employees poorly, and this reflects on how they feel about their customers. They are really trying to make the most money off of every person who walks in the door. They didn't fix the broken air conditioning. What does that tell you? Just a mess. Do not patronize them because you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"RAGING DIARRHEA!!!!!!

Tiniest table on earth. Cramped and uncomfortable.  Soup tasted like a can of progresso.  Our server, Guy was horrible!!  We ate our meal without any refills on our drinks.  We even flagged him down and he avoided us.  So I literally left the restaurant thirsty.  Bread arrived after our meal, which took 30 minutes to get.  Plus to top it all off, the men's restroom was filthy.  The floor was wet and littered with paper towels, and toilet paper and the sinks had no hot water, which I believe is a health code violation. 

Horrible, 100% AVOID.  Total waste of $70.  Ruined our evening which was supposed to be a celebration for a family event, especially since 2 of us got raging diarrhea within 30 minutes after dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I rarely get an evening out, and macaroni Grill is our go to for special occasions. It had been a while since we've been there. I was served wine in a water glass! The server said this is how they serve their house wines now. This was so embarrassing and cheap! I was hoping for a nice night out with my husband. The food was OK, but part of going to a restaurant 
and spending that money is for the atmosphere and feel. Wine in a water glass was not my idea of a classsy evening out."}
{"text":"Oh my never again. No drinks crappy service and on a birthday night. Still waiting for food 2 hrs. On a slow wednesday"}
{"text":"I used to love this place three years ago.  Now, everything has gone downhill.  The service is lacking.  Our server didn't offer drinks until we were ready to order our food, and twice we were confused with two different tables, even bringing us another table's check!  My boyfriend was starving so he ordered what he THOUGHT was a steak, only to be presented with four chunks of beef on two sticks, and some grilled vegetables.  The chicken fettucini had maybe three small pieces of chicken in it, which was disappointing.  After we were done eating, the server tells us, \"We cut the portions AND the prices, so you get what you pay for.\"  HUH????  To top it off, after the bill came, another server took it and said, \"I'll hand it to him for you,\" as if our own server was too busy to pick it up himself.  I used to work at a restaurant and never once did we ever pick up another server's bill \"for them.\"  My boyfriend offered my same sentiments when we left:  \"We're never going back there again.\""}
{"text":"Don't know why this place has bad reviews....
My husband and i come here at least once a month. He always gets the mac n cheese with chicken and I really enjoy building my own pasta. They accommodated us so well when we had our big family meal here the night before our wedding. The server even split the checks for us (just use your common sense and advise them upon arrival) 
The servers also keep the drinks full, bread at the table, and box our food in front of us."}
{"text":"ordered catering for a work luncheon.  Everything was so delicious and delivery was on time.  I definitely recommend them for your catering needs!"}
{"text":"Love their Caesar salad fresh bread with sliced and Parmesan cheese and cracked pepper are nice touches to what is already a good dish. I've had quite a few of their dishes and never been disappointed. My BF an Italian is super picky when it comes to Italian and he likes it."}
{"text":"Been going here forever... and a day.   I love the ambiance and the smell of a mesquite oven.
The pasta meals are fabulous... and the portions way too huge!  ( I usually take 1/2 home.)  Especially deadly is the delicious complimentary bread and olive oil/pepper that come with the table. So fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food was good so 5 stars for food, split the plate for us but waiter did the minimum. Manager literally avoided us (no reason for it, just rude) he went to three tables directly behind and in front of us, kinda funny actually. Won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"Yum!  Who doesn't like Macaroni Grill. I love authentic and hole in the wall local places, but I can appreciate a good chain restaurants too. 

They start you off with fresh warm bread to dip in Olive oil. Then our super friendly waitress Sarah offered us a taste of the house red wine.  I liked it, but was driving, so decided not to partake.  

I ordered two appetizers for $9, and chose the Goat Cheese Peppers and Fried Zucchini.  Both were very good, but the peppers were a little too sweet for me.  They taste like a sweet pickle, so if you like them, you will love these. 

My main course was the Brick Chicken with a side of Angel Hair Pasta in Lemon Butter sauce. Both were very good.  The chicken was super crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle. The pasta was light, but buttery and cooked very well. 

Of course I was entirely too full to eat all this and ended up with a huge Togo box. 
We'll be back."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  Gross. Bad service. Sent 2 things back due to being cold and soggy. They were unfazed, unapologetic. Did not care. 
Never ever eating there again."}
{"text":"Do not go here. Walked in and no one was at the host station to seat me. When they finally came to take me to a table, I sat there for about 10 minutes and no one server ever came. I got up and left and walked out right past the manager who never said a word."}
{"text":"I used to come here often when I lived in Phoenix, always had a good experience, and looked forward to a good meal when my family and I visited that area this week.  Sad to say, while the food was still good, the restaurant itself has gone way downhill.  The bathrooms were filthy and the service was abysmal.  In spite of mentioning to the staff multiple times that they forgot part of our order, we didn't receive the missing item until we were finished eating  Our waitress was in a daze, ignoring some of our requests (utensils, anyone?) and randomly bringing extra drinks to our table as we prepared to leave.  We won't be back and would never recommend this place to any friends.  (Enemies, maybe, but to to our friends.)"}
{"text":"The service here was excellent! Sky was really helpful to us as we were ordering and we were pleased with the choices we made for dinner that night.

Tonight we went with the $9 dinners, which looked and sounded divine. We went with the pesto chicken, pork belly chicken carbonara, and the Buffalo chicken  pasta.

It seems pretty well organized given the amount of traffic tonight.


If I am in AZ again, I will definitely stop by this locale again."}
{"text":"Worst service we have ever had at this place.  We came in with a group which seems to overwhelm this place to begin with, but there was just no excuse.  We ordered two appetizers for just myself & my wife almost immediately and it took almost 45 minutes.  The servers came and took orders for 20 people in our party, brought drinks, eventually came back with salads for all who got salad with their lunch and STILL no appetizers.

Finally the server brought out two appetizers however only ONE was what we ordered, the other we did NOT and could not eat it because of our diet.  Finally what we ordered came out.

Then our main dishes came out and my wife's fish was over cooked, it was served with rice and NO vegetables instead of all vegetables like she asked for.  

The entire experience was very upsetting and sad.  We may give them another try but I will not go out of my way to go back here as the service is one thing, they can get overwhelmed, but the food being overcooked, no excuse."}
{"text":"Oh wow has the food at this place got better or what? I went in here with my friend and we had what was a prefix meal. It started with the quinoa salad which was amazing really amazing and then we had a main dish plus you get the bread we had wine it was fantastic I would highly recommend it"}

Never go back to this place again !"}
{"text":"The chix parm is the only thing worth getting.  Everything else is prepared too far in advance like the chix for pasta is prepared earlier and warmed up. Chix parm was good just very thin.  It's a chain I should have known better."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant since I was a kid.  Food was exactly how good it was back then probably better. Same delicious bread with oil and vinegar to start off. We ordered the Mac n cheese bites and spicy meatballs for appetizer for $9.50 pick 2 deal. Cheese bites were outstanding!  For my entree I had chicken parmigiana and my brother had lasagne. Both were excellent.  I enjoy a simple spaghetti sauce and the one on the chicken parm hit the spot. Great dinner and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was well prepared. The prosciutto mac and chees was rally good. Steak was cook to order and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Just to be clear, I love Macaroni Grill's chicken Parm.  However the last two times we were in will be the last time we will be in. We went last year for a friends birthday and waited forever for the last two dinners to be served. We came in last night again for the same persons birthday. Same waitress ordered the same thing. We finally got 4 out of 6 dinners delivered COLD. Sent them back. Spoke to the manager who was as helpful as a dishrag. Told him we were walking out what did we owe. He said nothing so we walked. We also watched as the hostess was walking around from table to table looking for the person that ordered Lasagna. It happened to be the couple next to us. At least 5 minutes later the women was watching her husband eat the lasagna while waiting for hers. This location is really going down hill and it seems to be from the top on down. The waitress never came over and apologized or tried to make it work. We even told her that the last time we were in what happened and she said we will try to make this time good. She didn't. I say eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Had spaghetti and meatballs. Meatballs did not taste good. Tough texture. Pasta over cooked. Sauce no better than average. Poor beer selection. Had to wait for spoon for soup, then cheese for the soup, bread didn't come till almost when the entree came. Then had to wait for cheese for the entree. Second bottle of beer came after being asked and came without a cold glass. Poor experience and certainly not worth the price."}
{"text":"Spent 15 minutes in bar area and received no service whatsoever as they catered to the regulars. 6 people walked in after my wife and I and all were taken care of before us. We walked over to Chilli's next door and service was excellent.  No manager in sight...I see them going the way of their neighbor Lone Star which is now closed and vacant. Cold day in hell before I visit this establishment. Give this place 6 months ...."}
{"text":"This was some truly terrible pasta.

In town for business, my colleagues and I wandered here for food one night after a long day.  We stood at the host stand for so long without being greeted that we genuinely wondered if we were standing in the wrong place.  After flagging someone in an apron down, we were finally seated.

Service was friendly, but slow and, dare I say, bumbling.  Seemed like it took two tries on everything from drinks, to bread, to appetizers to get things right.  The menu was fairly limited, but there was a Make Your Own Pasta option, so two of us went for that.  We both ordered the whole wheat pasta with different sauces and toppings.

Now, whole wheat pasta can be iffy sometimes, but we had faith that a pasta place could get it right.  It was, hands down, no question, the worst pasta either of us had ever had.  Undercooked, stiff, and gross, we both ended up picking around it and eating the toppings.  I couldn't tell you the last time I sent food back, but I would have sent this back if I wasn't super tired and if I thought they had any hope of doing better.

The ladies room was a disgrace.  Every stall was dirty, and the only stall with toilet paper was the one with the broken lock.  A super obnoxious \"Learn to Speak Italian\" tape was blaring at me the whole time I was \"hovering\" and holding the door shut.

Never again."}
{"text":"We eat here often. We always sit at the bar. The happy hour specials are what bring us in. You can get a \"Fatbread\" pizza for $5.00. It is really good and we share it. It is just like a flatbread pizza with a little thicker crust. It is not large enough to share on its own so my husband gets a small salad and I get the soup of the day. They also server warn bread and olive oil free. You can get refills on the buttered seasoned bread if you wish. The happy hour house wine price can't be beat and they give a generous pour. The bartenders are always friendly and helpful and the service is fast but they never rush you. You can sit and eat bread and drink wine for as long as you want. To date we have never had a bad experience at the bar ordering from the happy hour menu. We will continue to frequent this establishment taking advantage of their happy hour cuisine and pricing. A great bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"We haven't been in a few years, because last time the meal wasn't very good.  There are so many options out there, that we decided to just stay away.  Well, hubby got a gift certificate, so we thought it might be time to give it a go.

We arrived at about 10pm (they close at 11pm), and it wasn't very crowded.  If you've read my other reviews, you'll know we like to go out kinda late.  Our server, Meaghan, greeted us with a smile and got us our drinks immediately.  She was the only server working the few tables that were scattered around the restaurant, and it's a big place.

The manager came over to take our order, since Meaghan was helping a large party on the other side.  We ordered the 2 for $9 apps--spicy ricotta meatballs and zucchini fritti.  Both of us ended up ordering the pork shank braised dinner.

A few minutes later we received our bread...which was still warm from the oven.  It was soft and delicious!  

We got our appetizers, and they turned out to be really good.  The meatballs were so tasty (and not spicy, which I was happy about) and the zucchini was really crispy on the outside, but hot and tender on the inside.  So far, everything was so much better than the last time.  

A little while later, our main dishes arrived.  They were served in large red baking dishes, and were wonderful!  The pork shank literally fell apart when my fork touched it.  The mushrooms and gravy were amazing.  And, the potatoes were nice and crispy, which I love!  The only part that was a downer, the carrots were sorta hard and raw.  They very easily could've been cooked along with the mushrooms and gravy, but weren't.  Hubby was able to eat everything, but I wasn't, which means I have a meal for tomorrow.

During the entire meal, Meaghan kept coming over to make sure our drinks were full and everything was alright.  She was all over the place with the various tables, as well as bussing them.  Between her and the manager, we never felt neglected, and they always had a smile on their faces.

This was a really good meal, and hopefully, it'll stay that way.  We'll definitely have to put them back into our rotation again."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately which is always nice. Our server was friendly and attentive. We never had to ask for a refill because he was always on top of it. The only complaint I can think of is the portion size for the grilled lamb chops was fairly small for the price and my sons Alfredo pasta was a little undercooked even for aldente. But, my chicken parmigiana was huge and delicious. This continues to be a go to place for us!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them no stars. First we were placed in the back where NO ONE could see us. Shortly after that others were seated & they received drinks before we did! 20 minutes later still no drinks & no one came to check on us..we just decided to leave. I'm never coming here again!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal here the other night! My friend and I went for dinner and were promptly seated and greeted by a wonderful waiter. I got an Italian Sausage Pizza and we split the Stuffed Mushrooms and they were both delicious! Great service too."}
{"text":"The food is a great disappointment.  The cost of the food is not worth it.  When it was brought to the manager's attention he did not do anything.  We ordered the chicken Alfredo with only 3 slices of chicken.  The chicken parmigiana is a 1/3 the size of a chicken breast.  The lasagna is mostly sauce and hardly any meat.  We paid the bill in full and the manager only discounted our bill for 2% of the bill."}
{"text":"Went before a show at the MIM for a quick dinner. It was part nostalgia, used to take my sons to the Scottsdale location back in the 90's.

The nostalgia was present but the food quality and service were more of a traumatic experience. 

It was a weeknight, not too busy, but our server was plainly rushed. Apps were okay, but we got the bruschetta instead of the prosciutto; understandable given the pronunciation.  Bruschetta was just...bad. Macaroni and cheese bites were ok.

Entrees were weak. Very weak. Meatballs and spaghetti plus ravioli were just less than mediocre.

Got the check with no question about coffee or dessert. 

Sloppy, mediocre food, fair to poor service and just unimpressive. There's a Target and a petsmart nearby. Guessing the food and service are better at either of those.

Goodbye nostalgia, Hello PTSD."}
{"text":"Starting at the beginning, my party of 2 arrived at 11:30 am on a Thursday. There was plenty of staff walking around. But nobody seated us for five minutes. I wish we had left then. 

A server walking by said he would be back shortly to take drink orders. He didn't. After enjoying conversation we began trying to get attention of servers at nearby tables. After twenty minutes, I got up and asked a server if someone could come get a drink order, etc. 

A few minutes later a nice waitress took our order and promptly brought drinks and bread. But we waited another 40 minutes for our meal. My salmon was extremely dry like it had been sitting under heat lamp for 20 minutes. My lunch companion's steak was COLD. 

Won't be going back to this location. Horrible."}
{"text":"This is our favorite casual dinner location. Between the grilled salmon with veges, the wine selection, the big booths and the large butcher paper on the table complete with crayons - it is an easy way to enjoy dinner and keep the kids occupied. Plus I really like the waiters and waitresses at this location. They are very attentive, pleasant and knowledgeable.

When it is busy, just relax and they will take good care of you. I am always impressed with the waiters and waitresses at this location ... did I already say that?"}
{"text":"Really good service by tinisha 
The music was the best part of the meal. 
I ordered the chicken caprece was my favorite but it was ok. Will order something else next time. Good wine list also!!"}
{"text":"The service is kind and friendly. 

However there was complementary bread served.

The Pizza I ordered was undercooked and had very little sauce.

Macaroni Grill has unfortunately taken a dive.  Best to avoid the place or at the very least this location."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday afternoon. Very slow.....
Maybe 5 tables 3 waitresses 4 or 5 cooks.. 
1 hour and 20 minutes.
The food was good though!"}
{"text":"Will not be returning to his location.  We went there for lunch Saturday.  No one was there to greet you.  When finally seated the table was not cleaned from last customer.  Took a long time to get waited on.  The bread was hard & she said sometimes that's how their batch comes in & basically they nook it a few minutes.....horrible.  Second one was ok.  My food was cold, she said it would not be spicy & it was.  Never asked if we needed more water.  My husband ask for soup never even got it.  

The customers behind us were complaining about their food as well."}
{"text":"Out of meatballs and Minestrone?  What kind of Italian restaurant is this!? You should focus more on the food and worry less about the wine"}
{"text":"Macaroni grill is usually one of my favorite lunch spots.  Today my husband's food cane to us cold no bueno!  Brandon took care of it and reheated it!?!? There was a small lunch crowd but they seemed short staffed.  My food was good i had the ravioli ehh!!"}
{"text":"Three course meal for $10 bucks is the best thing they could have done.  Filling and taste good. Our waitress Tenecia was nice.  I will be coming back especially to try all the items on the express lunch menu for $7 bucks you can't beat that.  Two working mothers spending their day off together and don't have to break our pockets to enjoy a good meal made by someone else."}
{"text":"Walked in with wife got seated right away. That was the only good thing.  Then a family of 8 or 10 was seated after us. As we were Looking at our menu still for food wondering when They will come and ask what we are drinking. They took care of the family of eight gave them the comp bread and drinks and we're taking orders Probably because now get a bigger tip who knows what do you expect from macaroni grill. So if any employees from macaroni grill who read my note that I left on the table cloth using a red Crayon\"Your Service Sucks 10mins No Drinks\" This is me .......So after 10 minutes I walked across the street to Chili's I was sat right away and I was also asked what it was I having to drink took our order he came back with our drinks ask what would you guys like to eat That took 11 minutes to get my food From when I entered Chili's"}
{"text":"So I've been to this location of Macaroni Grill a couple times now. I have this sort of nostalgic experience of going to a Macaroni Grill in the Chapel Hill/RDU area. Seems like it has always fallen short of that memory for me here.

To start with, the worst part would have to be the host/hostess service. Went in here on a more recent visit and the THREE hosts took several minutes to even acknowledge us while there wasn't even a line! One host seemed almost spaced out like he didn't know where he should be...he may have been high... The table waitstaff has been great though. Always friendly and responsive and quick with the food. Oh...and bread!

Speaking of bread, Olive Garden can shove off. Macaroni Grill's rosemary bread is the BEST. Hands down. For any chain restaurant fine dining establishment. Glazed in sea salt and soaked in olive oil with freshly cracked black pepper. Perfecto! Of course you can't go Italian without ordering pasta. Their pasta isn't flawless but it's better than most. I like to get some kind of seafood usually. On my most recent visit I got Pasta di Mare with shrimp, scallops and mussels. I was a bit disappointed in the just two shrimp and two scallops I got. But the shrimp are large at least. None of the seafood was overcooked either - always a good thing when eating out!

I also feel the need to mention that your server will come by and write their name on your table upside down - a skill they're clearly taught in training. You can also take to the crayons and color all over the paper covering the table cloth too. If you haven't been to Macaroni Grill yet, you need to get here. Trade your next Olive Garden outing for a visit to this place. It is the best Italian you can get out of the chains."}
{"text":"Oh my- if you want a real deal, come here Thursday night. An oversized bottle of house red for $16- and you can take what you don't finish. Large $5 pizza, offer cocktails on sale and beer for HH. Also a skinny menu- my friend highly recommends the grilled chicken with angel hair pasta option. And she's really skinny! Yolo"}
{"text":"Today I ordered the Pene Rustica dish, it's okay. I think it lacks authenticity. The sauce lacks flavor, but for all I know my taste buds could be changing. 

My appetizer was the Caprese, it was good. I think it could use more sauce on the plate, but that's if you like your food a little more sweet. 

This is a great place to have the kids come along. Drawing on the table is always a great distraction."}
{"text":"The food was ok, typical chain restaurant food, but the service was horrible! We were there on a Friday evening at about 8 pm and the restaurant was virtually empty. The hostess wasn't friendly and it took 15 minutes for our waiter to introduce himself. When he did finally show up he bumped into our table knocking the wine bottle over which actually hit my son. Needless to say I was less than impressed at this point. He proceeded to give his speel about dinner specials while belching in between sentences. He took our orders gave us olive oil and said bread would be out but that didn't happen. He took another couples order brought them their salads and bread before we got ours. My boyfriend had to stop him to ask for our food which he finally brought another 10 minutes later. Don't waste your time or money at this place. There must be a good reason this place was empty on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Definitely better than it's been over the last few years.  I'm not sure if they waitress was over loaded, absent minded, or just bad at her job, but she kept forgetting stuff.  Another waitress kept picking up her slack, so that was good."}
{"text":"The worst service imaginable. At first we were angry then it became comical. Bread came but with no bread plates so we had to sit and look at it. One person ordered a coke and 30 minutes later we had to flag down our server to get it. The salad came on a hot plate. We asked for additional bread after 45 minutes and no meal yet. Our server brought it saying it was in low supply tonight and we were lucky. It was COLD! I mean actually cold. After 50 minutes the meal finally came. I asked the server if they were short handed. She said yes it is a mess tonight. When the meals came one was wrong. I will never go here again. Never!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our second sub-par dining experience at this location. Of 6 entrees ordered at our table, 3 had serious issues. In general, pasta dishes are served without enough sauce. Carmela's Chicken turned out to be a huge bowl of rigatoni with about 3 bites of chicken in it. Lasagne was cold in the middle. The service was pleasant but fairly slow, and our dinner plates weren't cleared until after dessert. The manager did come around to see how everything was. We were provided with more sauce and chicken, and 2 entrees were comped. Since the lack of sauce and chicken are evidently a recurring issue, I wonder why they don't have someone checking the food before it comes out. 

The decor in the restaurant is attractive, and the fireplace is nice, but I'm not planning to go back."}
{"text":"Stayed in nearby hotel for a week, walked here twice to get takeout. Food was great both times, extra bread and dipping oil both times without asking, offered a soda while we waited both times as well. Consistent, friendly and fast for take out. One less star because first time they told us pick up later than necessary so food was a big cold and had to be heated. Generous portions, both times the leftovers made a full next day lunch."}
{"text":"The fettuccine is gross and was like eating a garlic clove. It was spicy and was not good at all.  I highly do not recommend going to this establishment."}
{"text":"I can't say how many times I've passed the Macaroni Grill, but I've never been in before.  I might have eaten at a Macaroni Grill before, but not this one.  So we stopped in one night, and it wasn't terribly busy.  Wasn't really empty either.  Just sort of in-between.  Service was adequate, but there were times where we tried to get glasses filled or a missing fork found, things like that.

The food was just... odd.  Though the chicken parm was decent, it's something tough to mess up (see Costello's).  What was really strange was the lasagna.  Rather than going for typical pasta, cheese and sauce, it also had sausage and meat that looked like salami or pepperoni or something.

I'm not against spice, but it just left a very odd taste, and it wasn't an altogether good one.  I think next time I'll just keep driving by and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So, it's been a while since i last ate at Macaroni Grill, so me and my boyfriend decided to eat there today.  I mean we got greeted by our server right away and our food came out right away.  Also, i didnt have much of a problem with our server except for the fact that when we got our food, he didn't check up on us at all to see if we needed anything.  He only came to our table when it was time to give us our bill.  And the food, it wasn't really good.  i guess there are so many italian restaurants out there thats similar that i put this restaurant on my bottom list.  It's not that bad, its just not that good either."}
{"text":"I happen to be in the area where I used to go and eat Pasta so I stop by and check out my old stamping ground and order my favorite  Spaghetti Tomato, Basil with Goats Cheese. It was good and got good customer service from my server Eli it's worth the stop nice place not pricey!"}
{"text":"Then our dinner took along time and our chicken was under cooked. Then the waiter after our meal said that he decided to put dessert on the house to make up for the complications. Any restaurant that empowers their employees to make those kind of customer service decisions earns a five star in my book. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My first time eating here, My server was excellent (Richerd), but there is another server saying (son of a bitch) 3 times. because  cashier Machine wasn't working. 

The food was good. 8/10"}
{"text":"The staff is pretty cool here and the food is what you would expect from Macaroni Grill.  They have a good selection of wines including a nice table wine.  The cannoli dessert is nom nom.  My favorite dish by far is the Penne Rustica.  It's just the right amount of bad.  Ok, that's a total lie.  It's all kinds of wrong.  Pancetta, cheese, cream.  Mmmmmmmmmm.

I went for dinner on a Friday eve and it was fairly empty.  Come after work with a few friends and swill down the table Chianti.  Everything else will fall into place."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant during the nightly happy hour and sat at the bar.  On our first round of drinks I ordered an Italian mojito (Bacardi rum, mulled mint, Campari and La Marca prosecco (4 Sips out of 5)) while A my wife requested a blood orange cosmo (Ketel One orange, blood orange (2.5 Sips)). On our next round my wife ordered the Italian mojito while I chose a Sorrento Lemonade (absolut vodka, Il Tramonto lemoncello and fresh lemonade (3 Sips) We enjoyed an order of spicy ricotta meatballs in a pommodoro sauce (2.5 Forks) which were tasty, but ricotta free from what we could tell."}
{"text":"Horrible and Worst service I've ever had! It's too slow in spite of not busy at all around 2:30PM.We just got drinks and Olive oil&black pepper, that's all.And I don't know why though without bread. Our waiter who is bartender didn't care at all so we did wait to order for 10min. It's waist of time totally.So we left there, just leave $10 on the table. What a lucky bartender!! Anyway I would never back this restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to go with Macaroni Grill for Valentines dinner date, wow what a mistake!! Waited over an hour and a half for our food.  Waitress didn't come back for a good 20-30 minutes to let us know what was going on. Then the manager came over and first thing out of her mouth was hi how's everything going??? Then I say um not good we've been waiting for almost an hour for our food. Then the manager seemed like she didn't really know what to do or what was going on. If your a restaurant and it's Valentines night you should probably be prepared for a busy night. The manager never came back to apologize and our waiter came over to ask us if the manager talked to us as if they never communicated. We had to tell our waitress that the manager said they would take care of the food on the bill. We finally got the bill which we had a sprite and a $6 happy hour drink. I would have expected they just Comp the whole bill instead of asking for $7.82. The manager at this location clearly has no idea what she is doing and if these chains want to stay around they should be looking for a new manager ASAP. Joke! Thanks for ruining our Valentines dinner date Macaroni Grill!"}
{"text":"I walk in last night and the host was this really strange guy who barely wanted to greet me, I asked for a table and he said it will.be 15 minutes didn't ask how many people in my party or showed me where to wait. We tried to sit in the bar and the bar stools were broken, there were also some really creepy people on the bar... very rude guy host , place was depressing looking, we left.because we don't need to give money to a restaurant that does.not treat customers right! I wish they would close and we could get a Brio that is so delicious!"}
{"text":"Anthony,  our server around 3:30pm today (Saturday) was one of the only positive forces in our experience. My wife ordered the Pasta di Mare as she was craving scallops. The 2 scallops with the meal were tiny and looked chewed on. When we made mention of the poorly plated food (after spending 3 minutes trying to get any employee's attention), the poorly trained female manager came over on the defensive and attempted to win an argument I suppose. They offered to bring a few extra scallops, and the offended chef was kind enough to bring us unflavored, cold, and mushy replacements. Between this experience and the complimentary, persistently annoying Disney singing performances, I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Our server; Lamad, was fantastic. I got the feeling that he genuinely loved his job and wanted to make our dining experience great. Which he did! The food was very good as well, but the service was above and beyond."}
{"text":"o sole mio.. o sole mio... 

I forgot what I ate, and I forgot what I drank..
Says a lot about this chain restaurant.  While it does not dissapoint, it is not memorable at all.

The hostess was kinda grumpy. We had an extra person , and she had to move us.. and she was all huff and puff.. I was like, lady, the place is empty.. why you mad?

Anyway, i totally cannot remember what i ate here.."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars

It was different. I like the atmosphere and warmth this place gives, it was very inviting. The vibe was calm and I enjoyed it. At first I thought this place literally grilled macaroni and I had no idea it was based on Italian food.

Service is quick and our waiter was very informative, she told us what the specials were and what kind of foods were good like the calamari. She also informed us about what kind of wine they had.

At first I got water because I didn't really know what kind of drinks were available but later when I felt comfortable enough I went ahead and ordered a Mojito and it was alright, I enjoyed it though. As for my main entree, I ordered the Filet steak with mash potato w/lobster. It was good, the meat had a good sear and was juicy, not too juicy though since I got it medium well done. I loved the mash potatos, I just wish there was a little more lobster, it was something new to me and it was great experiencing it... mash potato's and lobster who'd knew?

This place emphasized extra virgin olive oil almost on everything especially with the bread which left me wondering if they wanted us to hurry up and leave or it was made to make us feel full and satisfied, I assume it's to make us feel full and satisfied and I appreciate the strategy. Over all I enjoyed my experience with Macaroni Grill. I'd like to come back and check out the pasta dishes next time."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely fantastic but our waitress Daiana absolutely made the entire experience incredible. I would Highly suggest requesting to sit in her section!!!!"}
{"text":"charhe for 2 drinks when you otder a
dpuble. prices overstated. lunch snd dinner specials are for (to go) orders pnly. deceptive adveryising"}
{"text":"The restaurant was pretty empty and after waiting forever for somebody to take our order,   I noticed the table cloth was extremely dirty. When they brought my meat the potatoes tasted horrible and the meat was hard and cold. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Apparently getting their food through Postmates means the quality of food goes right out the window, and they don't care about forgetting to include most of the order with the delivery person."}
{"text":"Tasia  was friendly and nice. She explained to me how the $7 lunches work  and how you can order them at the express counter. If they don't have it out in 7 minutes your lunch is free.  They also $9 dinners as well.  I am glad I went there instead of Chili's. The ambiance is beautiful and relaxing. I love the fact that I was greeted when I entered and left the building. I  will definitely try them out again."}
{"text":"Thought the staff was incredibly rude. With out anyone else in the restaurant, my party of four was asked to wait. After we were seated and ordered our food did not all come out together. My seafood portofino dish had about a cup of  oiling the bottom of the plate"}
{"text":"This restaurant was AWESOME. The culinary  manager, Eugene, was GREAT. Our server, Maria, had so many tables and still was the best waitress I've ever had. The service was wonderful and the food was even better. This was my first time here and we will absolutely be back. Highly recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Let's start on a positive note...the house Malbec is drinkable. As for the meal, no matter what was ordered by the 7 of us having dinner, every dish had the consistency of mush and the red sauce was identical. In fact, I think they had my mother's recipe which used Heinz Ketchup as the base. I will say our waiter was very nice and attentive and another waiter who sang happy birthday had a truly wonderful voice, but even that couldn't make up for the un-hot lava cake with Hershey syrupy poured over it. With all the great Italian places in the greater Scottsdale area, it's easy to avoid this one."}
{"text":"Culinary manager, Tim Kahley, made sure our dining experience was awesome!  He had already worked over 12 hours when we got there. He projected the energy, professionalism, and attentiveness of a CEO.  He was a great listener!  Our waitress, Keissa, was great too!  She was on the ball, attentive, and personable."}
{"text":"I now understand why this place has such terrible reviews. I can't comment on the food because we never got a chance to try it. My boyfriend and I walked in and were seated almost immediately. That is pretty much all we did. We sat for fifteen minutes and not one person came to our table. There were only 5 other tables in the restaurant which should have tipped us off. The final straw was when three of the servers looked right at my boyfriend and then looked away. We walked out, right past the manager, who said nothing. Never again."}
{"text":"I came here for a fundraiser and we had the back room to ourselves. Everyone ordered from a prix fixe menu and got a salad and entrée. I had the garden salad and pollo caprese. The chicken was clearly a frozen slab with little seasonings and a small portion of pasta. I had about a bite before deciding to box it up for my husband to take to work the next day, it wasn't even worth eating. I had a bite of a friend's lasagna which was tasty. Another friend had a dish that had a \"side of orzo\".  In reality, it was a few leaves of lettuce with some orzo sprinkled in. When you advertise it as \"orzo\", you need to deliver the product. Service was okay, although it didn't really seem like the servers knew who was responsible for what, as people came and went but no one in particular was really dedicated to our party."}
{"text":"I came in here the other day, the food was amazing, however it's the service that made it worth coming back. Kiersa was our server, And her smile alone brightens your day. Then upon interaction she actually gets better, her enthusiasm, her attitude, and her energy is contagious. I highly recommend eating here, But only if Kiersa is your server. She is amazing. Five stars is not enough"}
{"text":"At first glance we thought this place was way to fancy to bring the two little kids to. Seeing our perplexed look the staff convinced us that they were accommodating and we were happy to find out that they indeed were. 

I had the Shrimp Portofino 2.5/5 which lacked depth but did fill my empty stomach. My fiancée had the mushroom ravioli 3.5/5, which had much nicer flavour. The kids selected the chicken and broccoli 2/5 which my youngest skipped the chicken and the broccoli but did like the pasta that came with it. My older child had the fettuccine Alfredo 4/5. And we all loved the bread that came with the meal."}
{"text":"Try the Chicken Cacciatore!! Its good!!!"}
{"text":"WOW 
So when I was a kid my parents told me they only sold salads here and I never wanted to go.
Today my boyfriend made me google the menu and I agreed to go. 
I GORGED MYSELF ON THIS DELICIOUS GLUTTONOUS FOOD. 
The macaroni bites: YUS. 
The sauce they came with, even MORE yes. 
The mozzarella triangle: not bad. Very good mixed with the Alfredo like sauce from the macaroni bites. 
The prosciutto and whatever it was cheese was good too.
The bread they bring at the beginning was good, I didn't care much for the oil sauce.
The house wine was dry so I tried a glass of the peachy moscato. 
I had the giant tortellini with Alfredo sauce. It was so good I ate every single bite and nearly made myself sick. But it was so good I couldn't stop.
Gabe had the chicken parmesan. I'll try his leftovers, he was smart enough to stop himself xD 
He had tiramisu 
I had vanilla gelato with caramel sauce and toffee bits that I couldn't finish cuz I was too full from everything else. 
Or waitress was Shelly, she was very helpful and friendly. She did a great job."}
{"text":"Walked in and saw over 10 empty tables at 8pm a Friday night. The host never even welcomed us and after waiting awhile, goes, \"How Many?\"  When we said 2, she said, \"It will be 45 minutes at least.\" Mind you, there was NO ONE else waiting. When I asked why the attitude, she goes, \"I don't have one, I'm just answering questions\". She was incredibly rude and I was absolutely dumbfounded. Multiple other people came in after us and they said the same thing. It felt like they really didn't want to seat anyone. They sat us less than 10 minutes later."}
{"text":"First time here! I absolutely loved it. Went in just after 1 pm & it was super empty. We sat in the dining room, but the bartender was our server. It made service a bit slower, but he was incredibly sweet. We came in with my 1 year old & it was great that she could draw on the table! Food was amazing. Best fettuccine alfredo I've had in forever.  I know this is a chain, which is why I've never been (17 years in the Valley), but this place is great)! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Over the last decade or so, i've probably come here at least 30 times.  Whereas, years ago this place was impressive in every way, I cannot say the same as of late.  In short, the prices have gone up and the portions have clearly shrunk over the years.  My latest (and i'm sure last) trip here proved to be very dissapointing from the very beginning!  As soon as we walked in, there was no host or hostess to be found so we could be seated, even though the place was perhaps 2/3 full.  We waited a few minutes before someone finally showed up, even with a line forming behind us.  Finally getting a table, I was brought a coffee, but no spoon, and there were no sweeteners on the table. The loaf of bread didn't come sliced, and no sharp knife came with it.  So we all had to rip pieces off it with our bare hands like a bunch of neanderthals.  My small piece of salmon came with one small bowl of spaghetti and a small salad.  No vegetables, a second side, or soup came with it.  It looked more like a small appetizer plate than a full-fledged meal.  Ditto regarding my daughter's order of chicken.  And this is not the first time I was dissapointed.  During a previous visit, I ordered the lobster ravioli, and I was given a grand total of 4 raviolis.  The manager apologized, and brought me another order so that my total portion size now approached a more reasonable and fairer amount of food.  The food here is delicious.  It's just a shame that I got fleeced with most unreasonable portion sizes.  I also noticed that many of their offerings are laden with trans fat.  I simply won't give this place another chance.  I'm done with Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"MUCH better!!! I previously heard that this restaurant had started serving small portions for higher prices.  The portions tonight were huge! 
The $5 happy hour pizzas were 14-16\" in diameter. 
The chicken Marsala dish was enough food for 2 people & the build your own pasta dish was enough for 3-4 people. The salmon was juicy & flavored deliciously. Very impressive flavor."}
{"text":"4 year old wanted spaghetti and meatballs so here is where I took her. Oops. Not busy and it took 2x for them to get BOTH of our meals correct. Hers had no meatballs and mine was so overcooked. What is funny is there was some kind of manager meeting there and this still was all messed up. Not sure it's worth going back. I mean my meal was over $11 for pasta, a bland sauce, and about 4 pinches of chicken and sausage. Eh."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. It has good food and lots going on, so it's fun just to people watch. Right now you can tell they're in the process of training new people, which we're super patient with because you gotta learn somehow and every visit we've had there has been really great. The food is always so good. I always get the shrimp scampi and my boyfriend gets the lobster ravioli. Then we usually split a desert and a bottle of wine. Definitely one of our favorite date night places."}
{"text":"It was only after we were seated that they let us know no pizza was available due to an issue with the oven.  Didn't go over well with three kids in group.   Waiter dumped a heap of cheese on a dish instead of slowly shredding it.  Service was well intended, but not very good.  It's sad to see this chain slipping into oblivion.   This location is no exception."}
{"text":"Came here for my daughters birthday.  The service was quick and servers were very polite. My kids and I enjoyed our dinner. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that for the most part, I really enjoy Macaroni Grill. The problem is not with the Macaroni Grill, but simply with the service at this restaurant. My wife and I went this Macaroni Grill a few weeks ago and had a terrible experience. The waitress wasn't attentive. She kept forgetting about us. We left upset.
I am a forgiving guy, so my wife and I tried again. We had a different server this time with the same result. The place was virtually empty, so I would expect that they would pay a little closer attention to us. I didn't happen. I had to flag down a waiter to get the check and get out of there. Very Poor Customer Service."}
{"text":"Every time I go in I always get wonderful service ! Lamb chops are always very delicious !"}
{"text":"Where do I begin....

The service was alright, I've had better. Ordered an Italian Mojito and it was undrinkable. I sent it back and decided to stick with the water. I had a salad with ranch dressing. The amount of dressing they give you amounts to someone spitting on your salad. Ask for more dressing cause you'll need it. I had the Rustic Penne which was good. My husband ordered the Chicken Parm and it looked thrown together. They used cherry tomatoes in the sauce which is a big no no. All that does it make the sauce soggy and the tomatoes very bitter. We didn't even get dessert. Wasn't in the mood to stay there.

Note to the restaurant: You may want to consider eliminating the whole \"singing\" thing you guys like to do. It stinks. Our waitress sang and I don't mean to be mean but she shouldn't be singing. Like a cat slowly dying.

Also, the temperature in the place was hot, like I just did yoga hot. Ughhhh.

We won't be returning, ever. I used to love this place and now, forget it."}
{"text":"Went in to try the \"Lunch in 7 minutes or it's free special\" with a couple of coworkers.  Needed a quick sit down lunch to get back to work.  We walked in at about 12:00pm.  The restaurant was about 1/3 full (surprising for lunchtime.)  No host to greet us, and a small wait.  Finally was seated by a waiter.  Was never told about the 7 minute menu or how to order it from the host, therefore, we asked our waitress when she finally arrived (waited about 4-5 minutes.)  I really hate that wait, especially when the restaurant is 2/3 empty.  When asked about the 7 minute lunch, the waitress pointed to the board menu and said that we had to order and pay from there (in other words no table service.)  It would have been very nice if the host mentioned that as now we already wasted 10 minutes of our lunchtime.  We went up to order and there was complete confusion with the staff taking our order.  I agree with some reviews here...TRAIN your staff or hire new staff!  

I had the Pepperoni Calzonetto, friend had Chicken Parm, other friend had Pronto Caesar.  When the cashier asked for drinks, I asked if they had Sweet Tea.  He said yes, and ran down all the flavors of teas.  I again asked for just Sweet Tea.  He then said, \"Sorry we only have what I said.\"  Obviously, he did not know what Sweet Tea was - TRAINING folks!

We did sit back down at our table and received our lunch in 7 minutes 40ish seconds.  I thought it out of their guarantee of 7 minutes, but my friends disagreed so we did not say anything.  Well I wish at least I did, because my lunch was horrible.  But I guess, what do you expect for $7 and 7 minutes nowadays?  Well, I was expecting what numerous articles said about their lunch..fast, but no quality lost.  Wrong (at least for mine.)  The cheese in my Calzonetto had gotten hard by the time I finished my first section (they cut it into four pieces.)  The sauce was also very lacking.  Lastly, the flat bread that held all that greatness together was burnt.  When I pointed it out the manager, she said that was how they cook the flat bread.  I wanted to laugh.  I then explained that it made the whole meal taste burnt.  She did offer a replacement, but like I said at the beginning, we had to be in and out.

Both of my friends said that their orders were ok.  Nothing to write home about, but they would return.  As for me, I will not."}
{"text":"Any Macaroni Grill has been our go-to restaurant for a casual meal out, but this particular location sticks out. Excellent service and the food is always prepared well."}
{"text":"I went there with my children a few weeks ago and I have to say, their menu has changed for the better. 

The quality of the food was very good. 

We had a wait a few minutes to be seated and sat on a bench near the expo kitchen. My kids were entertained by what seemed to be the manager who was expediting the food to the tables. She rocked it!

We had a server named Anthony. His personality was great but his technical skills weren't so good. 

We ordered a few appetizers. The baked mozzarella with prosciutto and the pepadu peppers. The prosciutto mozzarella came out pretty fast. The only problem was there were no share plates. I asked for them right away and they never came until 10 minutes later. I was watching Anthony, hoping he would grab some plates but sadly, he didn't. By the time we got them, the appetizer was barely warm. The peppers came almost 20 minutes later.

The food was delicious though. I had the braised pork shank. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service had a lot to be desired. Prices were very reasonable. 
We ordered from the lunch menu. For $10.50 you get a 3 course meal. An appetizer which was a  breaded, triangular piece of mozzarella, fried and topped with an arabiata sauce (very good). 2nd course was a Caesar Salad and the 3rd course was your choice of 4 different pasta dishes. I had the  4 cheese ravioli with a vodka sauce. A generous portion of ravioli that were delicious.
Service was very \"meh\". Waitress was in another world. Asked for silverware and she looked at us like ????? Silverware????. Too many things that I won't even mention. 
Would definitely go back for the lunch special. Really great deal. Wish i knew our servers name so you're sure not to have wait on you. Good thing it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"We stopped after a long hot day of shopping. Cherese was our server and she was excellent. It was a very busy floor but Cherese handled it with no problem. The food was tasty, but the reason we will be back is because of Cherese!"}
{"text":"I am going to base my review on a group consensus or for me alone it would have been lower.
Macaroni grill is a chain with several locations in and around Cleveland but when you have a group of 12 as we did on Christmas Eve your choices grow slim on who can accommodate seating.

First of all the reservation process was great. No worries here. They even called the day of to confirm which was great. I appreciated the confirmation call. The
waitress we had was hard working, efficient and accommodating. Some of the things you really want when you have a group that large and are diving checks amongst 3 families.

The food was overall just ok. 
House bread served with olive oil on the table was good but quality of olive oil tasted a little off. Adding balsamic and a little salt and pepper stepped it up as a dipping sauce.
Side Salad options were Caesar or house.
The house dressing, an Italian comes dressed on the salad but to me it was hard to taste so I requested another side which came out quickly and was quite tasty.
Several in our group had the chicken Parmesan and enjoyed it. 
The eggplant Parmesan however lacked firmness. It was soggy drenched under far too much cheese and a limited amount of sauce.
The rustica pasta was good and the ratatouille served with polenta was an enjoyable low calorie option on the menu. Several in our party enjoyed that dish.
2 in our party had pasta di mare and found the seafood dish average at best.

My biggest beef of the night was the cleanliness of those individuals delivering our food to the table. 2 gentleman whose nails looked less than clean. If your fingers are going to be resting on my plate I prefer to see clean fingernails. 

All in all a nice family atmosphere. Average Italian food!
Good for a large group as long as you plan ahead."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I have ate here, first thing the prices were really affordable and the food was pretty good. I will have to say the bread that they give you is really good. As for the staff they are pretty decent all and all the chicken Alfredo and over all experience were good I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible food. My friend ordered the lobster ravioli and the sauce on it was already separated from it being reheated. She sent that back and ordered a steak salad with rare steak. When it was served, the steak was medium well and the salad was smothered with crispy fried onions. It was just inedible. I had ordered the Bibb salad and that was also smothered with crispy onions. I ordered the pasta di mare. It was luke warm, had no seasoning 
and the seafood was overcooked and rubbery. I had to ask for a spoon for my fettuccini and there was no extra dish for the fish shells. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This afternoon I came to this restaurant and had a wonderful server named Leslie. She is great but the reason I am writing this review is for their management.

3 hours after I left, I realized I was a dummy and forgot my credit card. I immediately called and spoke with a manager Permisis. He stated he had my credit card and he would have it in his pocket. I let him know I am at the hotel 5 minutes away and I would be right there. He acknowledged that and said great thank you. 

I was to the restaurant no more than 5 minutes later and I walked in and was greeted by two hostess' who were wonderful and called another manager who was completely confused about what was happening and asked for my ID. He disappeared for a few minutes and came back who said Permisis left for the evening and he called him and he would be back to the restaurant within 15 minutes. 15 minutes later..... (I'm fuming at this point)..... Permisis waltz his happy ass inside and had the balls to simple say, \"You didn't give me enough time to  go Christmas shopping with your card! Can I see your ID?\" 

I grabbed my card out of his hand and left. He followed me out to the parking lot saying I'm sorry I was joking. And I said your professionalism is lacking. I am sitting outside in their parking lot leaving this review."}
{"text":"This location seems to be the redheaded stepchild of Macaroni Grills. The staff was very inattentive from hostess down to management. Underneath the table I sat at had bread crumbs, salt, and straw wrappers. The glasses and appetizer plates were filthy to the touch. The glass bottle of water that was set down on the table had several chips along the top. We sat down to eat at a very slow time for the restaurant and there were several other options of glass containers that were not chipped, broken, and cloudy. The appetizer bread had an awful texture and aftertaste. The waitress was not knowledgable about the food. She looked like a deer in the headlights anytime you asked her a question. She did, however, hit all of the steps/up-selling questions you want your servers to hit at a corporate restaurant. We were privy to overhear a loud conversation next to us by the staff lead by the manager bragging about how he just fired a girl. Thank you for being inclusive in your conversation. Overall, the attention to detail here is terrible. Down the the salt and pepper shakers being half full. I would not come back to this location. I hope this was just an off day here."}
{"text":"All of the pasta dishes from here were good. My wife love the Penne Rustica and I loved the Stuffed Mushrooms and the Eggplant Parmesan and our son the the Mac and Cheese"}
{"text":"We went there to attend a meeting with our clients, I ordered a eggplant parmisan... another co-worker ordered the same, he started eating before I did... I was about to eat and he whispered it to me, dont eat the eggplant is raw, it can make us sick... i stopped and examined and i observed the same. Anyways our clients were happy with what they ordered. We decided to proceed with our meeting and discussing work and not make a big deal about it. I did not eat all and just had my lemonade.

Next instance, it was my son's first birthday and we thought of having a dinner party, although RMG was never our first priority, my wife still decided to at least give them a call and ask them about party menu and other arrangements. They were the most expensive and totally INflexible. They said we could not make any changes to menu blah blah. We said thank you and proceeded with Olive Garden Happy valley."}
{"text":"The food is not that great for the prices and the service is terrible. The first time we went there, it took what seemed forever to get our food. We decided to try the place again thinking it was a bad night. This time it was worse. The waitress we had got several complaints. One table asked for the manager. We never got our bread and getting a refill was next to impossible. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I'll chalk this up to an unusual experience. I just got back from lunch with a group of 12 others from work (yes we had reservations). They were not prepared for our arrival. We waited too long for bread to be brought to the table and when it came there wasn't enough. The server said that they would bring more in a minute. Another server finally brought more and apologized saying that they were out of the normal bread. Several minutes after taking our order the server came back to those who ordered turkey sandwiches saying that they were out or turkey. Two of us said to substitute chicken for the turkey. A few minutes later a different server came and said that they are out of sandwich bread. I changed my order to a pasta dish. 

Lunch took TOO long! They were disorganized. They were out of too many things that should be staples for a restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a fettuccine alfredo fanatic- always ordering it at italian restaurants. I have never had a bad experience until the day I came here. There was SUCH A STRONG garlic flavor. I could taste minced garlic in each bite. I dont know what else to say. Definitely not up to par with other Macaroni Grills."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. The time I went before this one, my food took over an hour to make it to the table, and when it did; it was cold and the Manager could not care less. 

Today, I decided to give them one more chance, we ordered chicken Parmesan and fatbread (yes, I spelled it right) the chicken was BURN, fatbread was blah. What's wrong with quality check at this restaurant!!!!! Poor poor poor experience, don't go!!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was terrible. Was given the wrong soup without being asked yet still charged for it. Service was extremely slow despite the restaurant being nearly empty. Had an empty drink the entire visit. Asked for a refill again before leaving, waited 10 minutes and we left without a refill. Among worst service I've ever had. Left very disappointed. Can't justify greater than 1 star.

Service - 0/5

{"text":"I visited the Goodyear, AZ location on 7/7/2013 approximately during the 4:00PM hr.
I, my son, and my brother were seated immediately. The waitress did not come to tale our drink order in a timely manner. When she did finally arrive re order two virgin Pina Colada & one Paul Masson. We also ordered Nachos as an appetizer. The waitress returned w/ room temp water and bread only.
After eating at least three helpings of bread, we still had no drinks or appetizers. A manager came to the table offering apologies and stated that the restaurant was slammed. The restaurant was not busy/full by no means. In all due actuality a couple was seated after us was serviced and left even before the manager arrived w/ the appetizers. 
The waitress returned stating that the restaurant did not serve Pina Coloda. I found that rather funny and changed on drink to a strawberry daiquiri, and another much needed Bellini. The waitress returned w/ a luke warm Bellini and overly filled glass w/ a strawberry daiquiri that I ask her to clean up!!
Again... Still no dinner.... I ask that we be charged what we ate/drank and ask for a business card. The Manager came out w/ apologies, his card, and coupons. While waiting for my brother the manager stated that he would bag our meals and they were free.
I live literally across the street from this restaurant.... The food was cold and dry!!!
I have never in all my years experienced such bad service from beginning to the end. .

I do not have a problem w/ paying for good service/food.... But this was a horrible experience!!!
I don't know if I was singled out or what, but this is 2013!!! Others will know of this bad service!!"}
{"text":"Went here to eat tonight for dinner. Our fault for coming right in the middle of dinner rush but didn't think the wait would be too bad as we sat in the bar area. It took a good 15 minutes before we were acknowledged. The olive oil without our bread was the first red flag. More than 5 minutes later possibly more our bread came. Our drinks arrived 20 minutes after that. We were there a good hour before we actually got our entrees and the icing on the cake were the people who sat down behind us a good 30-40 minutes after we arrived got their food first. We ordered fettuccine Alfredo and pasta Milano. The waiter asked if we would like Parmesan and I stupidly said yes. I watched him go to get it but also watched him stop at two other tables and do other things in the process. A manager came over apologizing because he understood we waited so long for our food. I can only assume our food was sitting the pass forever before the waiter brought it to us. And the manager took less time to go get Parmesan but by the time he got back, our waiter finally remembered to come back with it. Again, I understand that they were busy and I know they are running around constantly but this was ridiculous. It just seemed like our waiter wasn't too concerned with how long we were waiting. Two stars for the manager caring more. The people sitting at the actual bar were getting better service!!

Update 5/14: just found out that this place has closed."}
{"text":"New menu, smaller portions same price. Got the Pasta Milano and it was salty and not enough cream sauce. Ordered Ice Tea, no one came around for refills. Manager came by and i told him about my meal and he did nothing. No wonder their parking lot was not full. Should have stayed at Famous Daves and waited 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Sometimes sacrifice is \" the name of the game\". 
We sacrificed; our good sense and decided on a late dinner, at this pasta chain next to the hotel.
Roman's sacrificed; quality food, that tastes good and is served hot (or at least a little warm) conversely, chilled if you..... say.... order a Caesar salad.
Service, at the expense of our servers potential date.. maybe party invite from the Gangsta Party of five at the next table
We watched our warm Italian bread grow cold and die a lonely food death in the kitchen window. Our last cocktail was served by the hostess. 
If you're in Litchfield Arizona thinking of stopping in for Macaroni at Roman's Grill...... Don't Do It !"}
{"text":"I have to admit, the food here is much more tasty than in any other Italian restaurant I've gone to, and I will definitely want to go again to try other dishes. The decor reminded me of being in Italy, where you can see the chef making fresh bread in the oven, and you're surrounded by brick walls and dim lights. 

I decided to \"Make Your Own Pasta,\" and made a shrimp alfredo pasta with angel hair and asparagus. Very interesting to add the asparagus, but I definitely did not regret it. The downside, however, is that the portions were pretty large, so I was unable to finish. BUT, it did make for a great leftover meal for after going out. 

Our waiter was great, too! He gave great suggestions and substitutions for different dishes, and made us feel comfortable and thought of. However, the pricing was pretty iffy and I wouldn't want to always to talk all the dishes home, so I wish the portion sizes were smaller."}
{"text":"We've dined here a few times recently and have been half impressed with our experience. Beer and wine selection are great and we have a few menu favorites that we get every time like the bruschetta appetizer and ceasar salad which I can recommend with no reservations. Also, we've had great experiences with the waitstaff and it's obvious that they are well trained.
So why only 3 stars? The food never seems to come out consistent - temperature, time the meal sat in the kitchen and presentation seem to really be a hit or miss thing there. We understand that restaurants get busy but slow night vs busy night didn't seem to account for what can only be considered as only average food quality.
Go and enjoy but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very clean and nice perfect for date night! They have hanging lights and the wait wasn't too bad for a Friday night. One thing I would say is when we ordered 2 glasses of water one tasted like sink water and the other tasted kind of normal. Other than that the food was great and reasonably priced the food came out in a timely manner. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal last night at this wonderful restaurant. Ask for Danny and get fantastic service!"}
{"text":"We wound up here because the buffet at Palace Station was closed. Our server, Roxi was fabulous! She was friendly and kept our drinks topped off. I think good service always deserves recognition, so hats off to Roxi!!

The food was yummy as usual, and the house wine was also a great. Fresh bread is always a bonus, and the restaurant is fun with the paper and crayons. The restaurant was close to empty except for a private party that was in the back, so we had full attention of the waitstaff, which is always nice."}
{"text":"Food now sucks....had the trio of chicken parm, lasagna and caneloni bolognese...all tasted like dog food...service was good....will never be back....how disappointing"}
{"text":"Very slow service getting drinks after we were seated.
Never got our salads during a long wait for entrees.
My wife's dinner was cold so they took it back to heat up.  Waited again even longer after we finished eating, to get our check.
Initial bill was full price, so I reminded the waitress we never got our salad. She came back with $5 off.
Never visited by a manager. 
Will never go back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4stars mainly for the excellent customer service I received from Kady or Kacy! (So sorry if I'm messing up the name!) She wasn't our main server, we originally came in for the fast dinner the $9 in 9minutes but ended up staying and enjoying a meal she went above and beyond to explain to my boyfriend who had a 1000 questions lol you just Dont get. Great customer service  like that anymore!"}
{"text":"I really like the Macaroni Grill in San Mateo, CA.  Thinking that a Macaroni Grill is a Macaroni Grill, I went to this location with my wife soon after we moved out to the Phoenix area.

Uh, ok.  Looks like a Macaroni Grill is NOT a Macaroni Grill.  This one didn't impress me.  I liked the bread, but the pasta was pretty well the pits.  It wasn't inedible, but it really wasn't very enjoyable either.

I grew up on pasta and have had pastas from the finest homemade style, to jarred store-bought sauces and cheap noodles.  This was getting towards the bottom.

It's hard to ruin pasta.  This MG comes pretty close.  With so many other pasta places to visit around the Valley, it's unlikely we'll be back."}
{"text":"Yet another example of what happens when accountants and efficiency experts take over a restaurant chain and run it into the ground.  

Experiences?   Being greeted at the check-in desk by a girl who had her mouth so full of chewing gum that she could hardly speak.    The server pouring our wine (tastes like grape juice) into cheap water glasses.   Being pitched and constantly upsold by our server. (Do they work on commission now?)  Waiting 30 minutes for our dishes, only to THEN be told by our server that the dish my wife ordered was no longer available, because they'd run out.

Advice?  Stay home, light a candle, pour a nice glass of Chianti, and open a can of Spaghetti-Os.   You'll be happier."}
{"text":"We received gift cards and were considering cashing them in using one of the services online, instead of using them at this restaurant, because we eat a plant-based diet for spiritual, health, environmental, and ethical reasons (See Daniel 1:11-16 and then watch \"What the Health\" and \"Earthlings\" if you are interested in gaining more understanding on that). We figured there was some type meat, butter, milk, egg and/or cheese in everything on the menu, but we called as a last ditch effort to have an easy family lunch on a Sunday. Fortunately for us, Taylor answered the phone when we called and was able to patiently help us \"create our own pasta\" over the phone with way more options than what was shown on the website. She knew how to work their menu to accommodate our lifestyle and allergy restrictions way better than the website. We had gluten free pasta with mushrooms, caramelized onions, roasted garlic, pine nuts, broccolini, asparagus, and artichoke, one with arrabiatta sauce and another with garlic olive oil. They also came with salads with Mediterranean dressing on the side. A completely vegan meal for $30! When I picked up the food, I told the manager he was lucky to have her as an employee (Sorry, I should have given him a little credit too as she did refer to him with some questions during the call. Thanks bro, I see you!) My only complaint is that their website was not as accommodating as Taylor. Corporate should give them a raise/promotion and employ Taylor to improve their website to feature options for those on vegan and allergy restricted diets, since she is clearly destined for glory!"}
{"text":"Over the years I have heard many people rave about Macaroni Grill. After visiting for the first time, I'm not sure why. 

To start, the bread was highly over seasoned, and thus too salty for my tastes. The same can be said of the Pollo Caprese that I ordered, as it had way too much pepper (had I not been so hungry, I would have asked for a new one). Furthermore, the staff was highly inattentive, which resulted in my table waiting a long time for our food and checks.  

Simply stated: save yourself the expense, and go somewhere else if you're in the Promenade."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of the food, but solely because of the service we received, I gave this visit 5 stars. Our waiter, LAMAD was awesome! He provided the kind of customer service that restaurants should strive for. He was friendly, attentive, patient and knowledgeable. He stayed engaged with everyone at the table... All 12 of us. He made sure that our drinks were full and that our orders were correct and as we expected. He even managed to satisfy the pickiest person of our group (who normally had something to complain about every meal)... He had no complaints whatsoever! I will return to this Macaroni Grill because of Lamad!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on chain restaurants. But i have to say this Macaroni Grill location was impressive. Service was prompt. Anything we wanted or needed was immediately given. Our waiter knew everything about the menu, and was very helpful.  The food was good. Restaurant was clean. Not a single complaint."}
{"text":"Usually I'm not a restaurant chain kinda person but being that we are stationed here at Luke Air Force base,  this is what we mostly have around. 
I'm very pleased with This Macaroni Grill for one, I asked for a dish they no longer have on the menu called 'warm spinach salad' omg to die for it's so delicious! Second  reason, twice we've been there we had amazing service from a young lady named Jessica and another young man that I unfortunately did not remember his name ;-(.  I do not recommend sitting at the bar for some reason we had very bad service there from a young man that I do remember his name but won't mention it, the bartender was on lunch break and asked him to help us, I asked to sample two house red wines he brought only one. This young man looked annoyed while servicing our table, he was not friendly at all! I did not order wine but the other two times we did eat there we ordered the bottle because I got the two samples from the two friendly servers. Needless to say hopefully they realize this young man is not good for the restaurant. If Management contacts me I'll be glad to give them his name. Please do your self a favor and try this restaurant even with that minor issue the food is amazing the staff is friendly with good food.... my thanks to the chefs!"}
{"text":"Came here on Thursday 11/5/15for my mine and my partners anniversary. First, at first the server had zero personality. We were pawned off to someone in training. She was super sweet, but new. 
Ordered what was said to be \"new\" on the menus which we were told would be off the menu because they are a \"trial and error\" story. It was the WORST steak ever! Disgusting in fact. 
Taken off the bill, management asked if I would like another meal in which I said sure (I am was hungry) however, and I may be wrong, why would I have had to still pay for it? I won't come back to this location at all. It was ridiculous that I was charged for something the server said she would not recommend but charged for another dinner in its place. I get it is a chain and they need their money and don't care if you come back, but it was all wrong from jump street. $50 of garbage!  Thanks for a great dinner of celebration, not!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh where to start!! I'm going to go ahead and write out our entire experience but before I do for those of you that don't want to read word for word on what happened let me just say if you're thinking about going to this place , DONT! Service and food is awful and not worth your money or time! There's a reason why they have 2 stars out of almost 200 reviews! That's awful just like the time we spent waiting on the food, and the wrong orders coming to the table left and right , and then over charging us on our bill....Okay so let me go ahead and explain everything ... First of all my mom was in town visiting so my sister and I wanted to take my mom out to dinner ... decided on this place because it was close to my sisters house ... when we got here and sat down it took 5 minutes for the waitress Rachel to even approach us... no big deal we could see it was busy and when she did come to the table she seemed scattered and told us she was really busy tonight ... we're pretty easy to please , we totally understood and told her to take her time ... we ordered our drinks first , my sister and I ordered waters and my mom asked for a house wine.... after waiting a while she came back with our drinks and we had to ask her for the bread that normally is served while waiting ... she then went to get it and came back but left us with no plates or vinaigrette ? So we waited for her to come around again to ask her for plates and the vinaigrette since we were all eating our bread on the paper mats... we then asked if we could just order our food (since we figured we would be waiting a while again) ... I had already ate prior to coming so I just ordered my 2 year old a kids mac n cheese, my sister ordered plain spaghetti with marinara , and my mom asked what the soup of the day was... she didn't know the two soups so she ran over to ask and then came back and said what they were ... my mom went with one of the soups she mentioned and then we started to wait on our food to come out ... after 10 minutes or so Rachel came back and said they were out of the soup my mom wanted ?? Okay, so my mom looked over the menu real quick again while Rachel was right there and went with the bruschetta with feta plate... after waiting for our food to come out the plates started coming ... first was my daughters kids mac n cheese , then another lady server came out and handed my sister noodles in a bowl? JUST NOODLES!  No marinara sauce? So my sister handed it right back and said I'm sorry I ordered spaghetti with marinara ?  And the girl didn't say anything and took the plate and turned around fast to walk it back with major attitude... then my moms plate came back and there was no feta? And Rachel said \"I'm sorry, yeahhh were out of feta\" .... ???? What is going on with all this mix up? How hard is it? I didn't even order anything?! Then after we were all mad at this point with the awful service and the huge waiting gaps , we got our check ... $50.00!! WHAT?? For TWO people and a kid to eat and two classes of house wine?? Whats wrong here? So we overlooked the check and of course she gave my mom an $11.00 A GLASS WINE! House wine is supposed to be the cheapest? So when she came back we mentioned how awful our entire experience was and there's no reason for our bill to be this high being that my mom asked for the house wine... so she quickly took the bill all scattered and said she would ask what the manager what she could do ... came back 7 minutes later and only $4.31 was takin off... 4 FLIPPING DOLLARS! I mean come on we're not asking for our entire meals to be takin off but gosh at LEAST one of the wine glasses for all we went through? Especially being that each glass was $11 dollars that Rachel secretly put one there! Which she then tried to explained they serve the wine glasses in two sizes and they serve the wine in the largest glass unless the customer asks for a smaller one... ????? we were pissed at this point and just paid the check and still gave her 20% tip that she didn't deserve and left ... WONT EVER BE COMING BACK AGAIN! AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL! Surprised the manager didn't take off more or come to the table to apologize for the awful experience.... i'll be leaving the receipts in the picture section on here .... now looking at both recites I'm wondering why she gave us military discount after the fact? I'm starting to wonder if she even spoke with the manager and just maybe tried to do it on her own?? Mmmmmm...."}
{"text":"Love doodling on the table, had a great visit, server was super sweet also. I've pretty much always had great food and service.

Haha either way, great fun and food."}
{"text":"After buying my house over a year ago in this neighborhood. I used to be a regular here. I cannot say how many times I have ordered the chicken parm dinner, maybe about 15 times, but lost count. The chicken parm is fantastic, however...........THEY CAN'T GET THE PASTA EVEN WARM with dinner. I have mentioned to them several times about this issue. I have even asked them to \"wait to cook the pasta\" until after my chicken parm was done. That did not work either, The last time I went in here was about a month ago, and even before I ordered, I asked to speak to the manager and told her to please make sure my pasta was not cold. Sure enough, same thing happened. Wondering how many times it takes until they can get it right? They have lost my regular business (twice a month) and moved on to Olive Garden on Sunset Rd."}
{"text":"Server was friendly food fresh and tasted amazing loved hearing Sinatra playing on the speakers atmosphere family friendly"}
{"text":"Its been a few years since visiting a Macaroni Grill, and we were pleasantly surprised with this visit, Amber our server was very attentive, knew the menu, and was very pleasant and always had a great smile.  The meal was tasty, and had a good quantity for the price.  Will be coming back more often."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Upgrade to the bibb and bleu salad! New management. Making awesone changes!!!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to give Macaroni Grill another chance, hoping that I would have a better experience than my parents did a couple years back. Well.........I should have conituned with the tradition of leaving this place alone. First, our waitress went missing a few times. We had to ask another waitress, which I hate doing because they have their own tables they are watching, for something different because our food was extremely salty. After sending our food back, you would think that our waitress would come back and ask what happened and apologize.....Nope. The manager brought out our food but never apologized. Her body language basically said, \"Don't speak to me and don't complain.\"...Great leadership. Our waitress never circled back to see if we were doing until about 15-20 minutes later. It's terrible when you try to give a restaurant another chance but fail, yet again. You would think that they would really try a little harder to provide excellent customer service and delicious food, especially when there are only a few Macaroni Grill's left."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience at this restaurant. We didn't get our drinks for 20 minutes after we arrived. 2 pops and 2 milks.  I ordered the lobster filled ravioli which was like mush. I asked for something else, eggplant parm. 25 minutes later the waitress came back to our table to clear everyone else's plates and says \"oh you never got your food, did you? Should I just box it to go?\". The food was terrible and the service was terrible. We'll never be back."}
{"text":"So-so. Came in for some dessert with some friends. Ordered the strawberry cheese cake and the tiramisu. I was really excited by the description of the cheesecake with \"strawberries\"... (Plural) But when the cheesecake came out, there was only one strawberry! I attached a pic of the dessert menu and cheesecake. And, I think it's strawberry season right now! I felt like both desserts were alright but not amazing enough to make me want more :/ The service was okay. The server kept serving us from the side of the kitchen over the wall of the booth which felt a little awkward."}
{"text":"I lived in this area for a year. I loved this place. As I moved out of the area the place was going through many different \"investors\" or owners. The whole company as a whole not just this location. So what the restaurant was has changed a lot. It used to be a nice, fun casual place to eat. Now it seems like they are going for Italian bistro. Honestly its too big of a space to pull something like that off.. Now they have people sing, there. Sing... first of all the place has a hollowed out ceiling with venting visible. Only about two tables can hear the singers. The other tables are like whats going on now? Its just not a good idea with the way the building is built. They have an open kitchen so you can watch them cook if you like..... Usually even when slammed the kitchen runs like clockwork. This time the friend i was with mentioned that they seemed  overwhelmed or frustrated. Also they bring a giant bottle of wine and work on the honor system? Really where is Robert Irvine when you need him. I can just imagine. Do you know how much money you are loosing by going on the honors system? New investors coming soon."}
{"text":"Two words LUNCH MENU! This is by far the best place to grab a decent business lunch with coworkers. They have a counter menu that you can have at the table and for around 10 bucks including tip you can get a great lunch. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area and want a quick, value priced, and great lunch."}
{"text":"For my last roomie meal, we went to a place close to our house and somewhere she recommended. I've never been to a Macaroni Grill but heard some pretty great things about this place through the roomie. Because it was yet another new place, I took hold of the opportunity to review it!

Macaroni Grill is definitely accessible and located on one of Henderson's busiest streets for restaurants and retail, Stephanie. The restaurant is located in a stand alone building and part of a long strip mall. As I was educated, all Macaroni Grills look the same indoors: You walk down a ramp to the hosting station. To the left of the station is a bar area and to the right is the open kitchen. Pass the station and you'll see a bunch of booth and table top seating. The colors are rich in browns and red. The tables have a cloth on it and then white paper on top of that so you can draw on it. The entire feel definitely gives off an Italian vibe. 

Our server was Sara. She was definitely a nice gal and super personable. At times though, it was a little too much. She would linger around the table and make jokes about something, even if my roommate and I were in the middle of our conversation. She also checked back with us a bunch of times. Too many, it seemed like every two minutes. I think it was because of the lack of guests for lunch. That meant more time with her tables. I appreciated the gesture but could have loved it more if it was done less. 

For lunch, I got the Pasta di mare for $18. Scallops, mussels, shrimp, fettuccine, white wine, pomodoro and garlic. The proteins were soooo good! All three were perfectly cooked and really was the star of the dish! I loved that the fettuccine was aldente, not mushy and held onto the tomato sauce. They sliced the garlic so you had huge chunks in the dish. For me, that was great. 

They also had a special going on for appetizers. You pick two items off a list for $9. We got a total of 4 items and here's what I thought:

-Goat Cheese Peppadew Peppers - This was a cold dish. Although I wasn't crazy about the peppers, the creaminess of the goat cheese was super good.

-Zucchini Fritti - these were large sliced zucchini, breaded in breadcrumbs and served with marinara sauce. I would have preferred to have smaller slices, but the texture and flavors were good. 

-Ricotta meatballs - The meatballs were too small and there was a lot of marinara sauce. It just drowned in the sauce. Not my favorite choice.

-Mac & Cheese Bites - The were crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Out of the 4 options chosen, this was my favorite. 


All in all, I had a good time. I would definitely come back for the Pasta di Mare. If you like seafood, you will love this! Don't worry, the menu is packed with a variety of meats and other proteins. You'll find something no matter what. If you're in the area, come check them out!"}
{"text":"On an impromptu trip back to Las Vegas, some friends and I decided to go to Macaroni Grill for a meal of pasta. I've been going to Macaroni Grill for some time now in other parts of Vegas when I was a local so I'm quite familiar with their chain. 

All Macaroni Grills are pretty much the same. You walk in, the bar is to the left and the kitchen is to the right. You walk down a ramp and the tables are in the middle and back part of the restaurant. There are table tops and booths for you to choose from. On each table, there's butcher paper with crayons to doodle on. The servers come, write their names, serve bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Our server was personable and loved to make small talk.

For dinner, I got the Pasta di Mare for $18. Pasta with scallops, mussels, shrimp, fettuccine, white wine sauce, pomodoro and garlic. I love this dish! Lots of seafood and lots of flavors. This dish is is packed with protein, you feel like you're getting your money's worth. I loved the flavors! 

If you're ever in the area, come visit Macaroni Grill. They offer all sorts of pasta dishes with different types of proteins. Pair them up with a good wine and you've got a great meal!"}
{"text":"I have to rate this location a 2. Service was mediocre (server was unattentive, all over the place, rude, and even had personal conversations with her coworker on the other side of the room), location is ridiculous (have to make a left turn and circle the plaza just to get to the parking), food was terrible (bland, felt plastic, and the birthday dessert we had for my boyfriends birthday was ROCK solid. I've never had a chocolate dessert where it took a knife to cut through) and not to mention the fact that all the servers were yelling at the cook. 

I've had better service before but this particular time was just terrible. I don't think I'll be visiting again or any time soon. I was hoping I would receive the best of the best considering the many good reviews but I guess you have to come in at a good time to receive exceptional service. Nonetheless, it was \"ok\"."}
{"text":"WOW! Amazing food, we had the bruschetta crostini and the zucchini fritti tapas and they brought us a sample of the goat cheese peppadew pepper tapas as well because we couldn't decide which we wanted to order. Our server recomended a few entres and went into great detail about all of them James knows the menu and recomended the 2 entres we ordered,mushroom and chicken catalone and the chicken marcella. While we were waiting for our meals they brought us this amazing bread to dip in olive oil and peper. When our meals came James offered us fresh grated cheese and our meals were once again better than we expected. He boxed our leftovers for us and brought us a desert menu and again explained in great detail what each was. We chose the lemon passion and the homemade chocolate cake they were both fabulous. We also had an espresso which was the best I have had in ages. Our service and experience was far beyond what we expected upon coming in we will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Macaroni grill has been one of my favorite places for years. After today I may not be going back! I found a pregnant roach in my pasta! At first my husband thought it was a caper misplaced but when he squeezed it....creamy eggs came out!!! When we told the waitress she got her manager and she said it looked like a cooked pine nut and offered to comp my two dishes. Once I showed her my picture up close (it obviously was not a pine nut) she got the general manager who apologized and offered dessert. At this point I lost my appetite and didn't want to eat anything from the kitchen. I understand that mistakes happen but just beware when you go here...I would examine your food first!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving 2 stars is is because the manager tried to do the right thing but failed miserably. Being Mother's Day, I did not want to go to a restaurant  and wait for hours (my husband didn't pre plan) , every restaurant had a 1 to 1 1/2 hour delivery/pick up time. I came across Macaroni Grill, it said 20 min pickup time..at 7:27 I placed my ordered online and received a confirmation email that my order would be ready at 7:50 - I rushed my husband out the door to pick up the food and when he got there, they said it was going to be another HOUR! My husband complained, and they apologized and gave him a credit for $30 - Our food was finally ready at 9pm! We live 5 min from the restaurant and when we unpacked the food, it was ICE COLD! The chicken was like rubber and inedible! I will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this particular location after church. We normally go to the W. Sahara location but we were on this side of town. We were immediately seated and was told that our waitress named Tiffany will be right over. Ten minutes later a lady came over and said that Tiffany was a little busy but can she start us out with drinks? I couldn't quite understand why she would be, do the fact that there was less than ten people in the building but OK.. Since we've been here a few times ,we already were familiar with the menu and ordered right away. It took them 20 minutes just to comeback with our salad.. And you guest it still no Tiffany. Our dinner was finally served 30 minutes later and It wasn't as good like the location on W Sahara. We normally stick around for dessert but we opted out. Tiffany never arrived. I hope shes OK"}
{"text":"I think Macaroni Grill is a great place to take the fam, little ones included. It's not so much a romantic date spot, but it's still a fun, lively place to have some good Italian food. 

For apps, they have a really good spinach and artichoke dip as well as some tasty mushroom raviolis.

For lunch and dinner, they have tons of pasta, pizza, sandwiches and soups to choose from as well as a pretty good wine and beverage list.

The kiddie menu isn't bad either and if I remember right, they give kids placemats to color on or something along those lines.

If you go, promise me you will try the dessert ravioli! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"we are so happy when we eat here and the servers are all great here and always willing to help us at any time--great food at great places"}
{"text":"Very nice evening out.  Jacob was our server and was very pleasant to deal with.  A house bottle of wine....for four of us was pretty good.  We all had entrees which were very good.  The pacing was perfect and no rush at the end of the meal.  It's not your high end Italian restaurant,  but pretty good."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch after a very long break from my last visit.  I've been visiting this location since I first moved to the North Phoenix area as a pre-teen with my family.  Over the years, service has generally been good but there was a period of time where it took a nose dive and I stopped visiting for over 2 years.  I don't remember what prompted me to start visiting again but things improved considerably and I became a regular patron again.

This is my favorite Italian chain and I would go out of my way to come here instead of going to Olive Garden, Cucina Tagliani's, and Buca di Beppo - all locations that are closer to me in my not-so-new Glendale hometown.  Macaroni Grill's menu is just simply something I like a lot better than the other places I mentioned.

I got my usual Carmela's Chicken rigatoni and the hubby got his Penne Rustica.  Both were delicious - served hot and noodles were cooked right.  The bread that was served at the beginning was also hot and fresh.  We got Rachel for our server and she was really delightful to have and I would love to be served by her again on our next visit."}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day with my wife. Never been here, but have always wanted to try it. Well, we were surprised that it wasn't that great. 

Let's start out with the restaurant itself. It doesn't look to bad and it tries to be like an authentic Italian restaurant. The benches at our table were designed for large people. My wife couldn't reach the table while sitting normal, she had to scoot up just to eat. Also, they have paper sheets as a disposable table cloth. Kinda of cheap looking.

Now to the main reason for going here, the food. They start you off with some bread and olive oil with pepper dip. The bread is baked with rosemary and topped with butter and salt. It was pretty tasty, but a little heavy on the rosemary. My wife ordered the Chicken Marsalla (I think that's how it's spelt). Anyways, this dish didn't mention anything about having rosemary in it. It only tasted like rosemary. So, it was returned for a salad. That was also subpar. Now to my order, which was a Caesar Salad and Blacken Chicken Parmesan. The salad was great, the chicken was only okay. You would expect this place to use fresh ingredients and this chicken was a frozen pattie (well 2 frozen patties). 

On to the service. Our server was named Serena and was friendly. You could also tell she was fairly new as she rarely came by to check up on us. She didn't even ask my wife for a dressing preference on her salad and brought her whatever she felt like.  

So overall this wasn't a great experience for us here and I can say we will not be returning to this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food because we didn't get a table even though half of the restaurant was empty. The excuse from the hostess was they were waiting for more staff to come. We waited for 10 minutes and no sign of the hostess planning to seat anyone after two tables left so we went to another one as there are at least 10 restaurants within walking distance. And we're not the only group left. There're two more during our wait."}
{"text":"The other half of the chicken must've gotten stuck to the brick....Ordered the chicken under the brick for a whopping price of $18.49 and it was only 1/2 a chicken and an anorexic one at that, so was very disappointed despite the delicious flavor. My friend was very happy with the Eggplant Parmigiana, and didn't leave even a drop of sauce but kept dipping the warm roll/bread in it, so that is why the rating is saved from being lower. The $4 draft beers were a fair price and so glad they have some representative locals. Sinjon was a fine server at the bar and was frank about some items we were considering but he explained in detail why we might not like them based on the send-backs and comments he had heard."}
{"text":"We decided to head to Macaroni Grill tonight for dinner, had our seven year old grandson with us.  The food was so delicious as always.  Best of all the magician that was entertaining was fantastic... hope you keep him, my grandson said it was so exciting he almost peed!"}
{"text":"My family and I took my mother their for her birthday.  Our waitress (Angie) was very nice.  But the food was not good at all.  I ordered parmesan crusted chicken salad.  They were skimpy with the chicken.  Everybody was not happy with the food.  This will be the last time I go there."}
{"text":"Love me some Mac Grill! Their flavored lemonade are to die for. I always get chicken parm or create my own pasta... Can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us. 

Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not. 

This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was. 

Overall, I will never go to that restaurant again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last week and we have been to Macaroni Grill restaurants before but I must say this was the worst service we ever had, only giving two stars because the food was decent.  

First our server seemed to have an attitude, we asked for lemons with our waters and after him being back at our table twice after asking he came back with two small lemon slices (not even wedges) and said they were out.  We did later find out they were indeed out, but why not just tell us that in a nice manner before just ignoring our request for 15 minutes.  When our waters were served we were not given straws, then once we asked he took them out of his apron and only had one and threw it on the table and shook his head and walked away without saying anything, then came back after 5 more minutes with two more straws and set them down without saying anything.  

We had to ask for bread and he walked by us twice with bread, once giving it to another table that was seated well after us.  This guy really had an attitude, and you know I realize people have bad days so we were being nice and not trying to give him a hard time, I told my wife maybe he is just having an off day.  But it was like that through the whole entire meal.  

Also they were not just out of lemons, the table behind us asked for something fried, but we didn't hear exactly what but then we did here the lady say, \"so your out of lemons and this?\"  One thing is a mistake, multiple things being out is bad management somewhere.  

The food itself was not bad and typical quality for Macaroni Grill which we really like.  

I will drive another 30 minutes away next time to go to the other Charlotte location before going to this one again.  My wife felt bad for even suggesting it after we went, wasn't her fault."}
{"text":"Service was much better than the University location but, the bread wasnt ready so we waited a long time for it. Food was ok. My wife's order was not totally right. She did the Pasta Your Way and they gave her the wrong pasta and forgot the meatballs (which we were charged for initially). We chose not to complain because our waitress was running around like crazy because she was the only one waiting on tables with a little help from the manager. There were two other waitresses that were just standing around.  We suspect they weren't on the clock, but the perception was bad."}
{"text":"We all have those special places we like to default to for celebrating something special, like a birthday or Singles Awareness Day. My default spot is Macaroni Grill. Not in the sense of, like, \"Well, guess we should just go where we always go,\" but more like, \"Yes! It's my birthday and I get to go to Macaroni Grill!\"

The place is nice looking, with raw stone walls, fancy glass lanterns, a pretty bar, and a kitchen that's open for public viewing. Service is prompt and courteous, and each table is topped with butcher paper, and you get a couple Crayolas to go with it. If there's ever been a wait for my meal, I haven't noticed, since I'm always so busy doodling. 

The house wine's mighty fine. I recommend you try the Past Milano -- bow tie pasta tossed with grilled chicken, sun dried tomatoes, 'shrooms, and fresh basil in an asiago-cream sauce. With the bread they serve (a fresh loaf of rosemary bread, brushed with olive oil and lightly salted), a salad, and the huge portion you receive (I'm not talking Bucca-big, family-sized, but huge for one), there should be plenty of leftovers for a midnight snack.

Oh, and for birthdays, you get a slab of rich, dark, chocolate cake, smothered in a scrumptious chocolate ganache. And they have people who will sing to you with a beautiful operatic voice.

Once, when I was way big into gymnastics (this was looooong ago), I sat at a table next to Amanda Borden. She drew me a huge picture on her table paper, and I took it home and stuck it to my wall. Ahh, special happy childhood memories."}
{"text":"Wow, that is all I can say.  It was my worst experience dining ever, because it was so obvious the staff there could careless.  Food was actually decent, but seriously the worst service ever.  It was like being in the twilight zone or a hidden TV show waiting for the cameras to pop out.  We ordered two entrees, got three, two drinks, got three, and then charged for them.  Sat by the kitchen doors, watched all the staff just eating back there.  It was seriously just weird, the whole vibe.  It is not actually cheap either, no way will that place be open in 3 months.  Desert Ridge was packed 20-30 minutes anywhere else, empty there....now I get it.  That place use to be a great restaurant back in the day for a decent meal.

It was just weird, I am okay with bad service because we all have bad days and rough work days.  But everyone there just was careless and it was so obvious they didn't even try.....take some pride in what you do."}
{"text":"Excellent food - and Aaron the bartender was our server. He was amazing! And the entire staff was attentive to our needs! When the bill came, we were pleasantly surprised by it as well! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"If I wasn't in public th my wife giving me the eye I would have licked the plate!!!!! A little pricey but awesome sauce!"}
{"text":"I quit drinking 2006 but I still enjoy non alcoholic beer with my food when we go out to eat . Well I guess some corporate douche decided not to serve it anymore.  Sorry douche bag we won't come back"}
{"text":"Believe it or not but this was my first time ever at a Mac Grill.  We do t do a lot of franchise type restaurants but this was great.  

We were immediately seated upon entry, asked for drinks very quickly and then had order placed.  

The food was great.  We enjoyed spaghetti, lamb chops, create your own pasta and lamb chops.  Everything was great and our server, Michelle was very attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here on Thursday, June 25th, 2015. I have to say, we were disappointed. My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. After his first bite, he said the meatballs tasted like the Chef Boyardee meatballs our kids used to eat. Not very appetizing. He asked the waiter if the meatballs were made in house. The waiter believed they were but went to ask. Nope, the meatballs are shipped frozen to the restaurant. That's embarrassing. My son and I both ordered the steak. It is served in a sauté pan. I'm not sure why because it makes it difficult to cut the steak. My portion of meat was a nice cut, but my son's portion  was an inferior cut. It was terrible. The potatoes that were served with the meal had clearly been cooked a long time ago and then reheated and served with the steak. The waiter was pleasant and attentive. But I have eaten my last meal at this restaurant. Macaroni Grill no longer serves fresh innovative meals. They've resorted to short cuts and the quality of what's being served has gone down hill."}
{"text":"When we arrived, we were seated for almost 20 minutes before anyone came over and even offered us a water.  We decided to leave, and were stopped at the door by Hector, the manager.  We explained to him why were leaving, and he vowed to make it right if we stayed. 

And boy did he. What started as a negative review gets turned right around by the problem solving of Hector. 

Food was excellent.  We really enjoyed the house red as well. Hector the manager was very hospitable.

Eric and kaylah"}
{"text":"Food is good but they are cheap with the takeout. They don't even give you enough for your money. I'll probably would return to eat in."}
{"text":"I have to give a shout out to a gentleman by the name of Mike. He's served me multiple times and has always been on top of things when it comes to refilling drinks, removing dishes, etc.

The bread is always crispy and fresh, the pastas come in big servings, and the crayons and parchment the restaurant uses as tablecloths add a bit of whimsy to the meal. 

My family and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Never coming back here again this is the worst Romano's Macaroni Grill I've ever been to. The service was shitty the calamari was gummy the prosciutto mozzarella was not that great, I ordered a Italian soda and got an iced tea, it wasn't even that busy but I felt like the whole time my waiter was just waiting for me to leave."}
{"text":"Ughh so much regret when we went here I have high hopes with there food but is so disappointing my food is $19 ordered shrimp scampi but just end up eating the shrimp out of it they had my son's order mixed up with someone else's food my husband got steak and he usually eat that all when we leave restaurant but this time he didn't he just didn't like it. The only reason why I give two star is because my daughter like her food which is macaroni and cheese atleast that one didn't go to waste but rather than that didn't like the food our first time it will probably the last unless other locations would have better food..taste wise."}
{"text":"One word: LAMAD! He is the charismatic bartender at Macaroni Grill and an absolute delight! My (3) sisters and I have never eaten at Macaroni Grill and this guy made our whole experience THE BOMB! Excellent service, has awesome menu suggestions, great conversation & he treats you like V.I.P. This guy was above exceptional and he is the reason we WILL be returning here. The food was good and was served about 10 mins after we ordered. But the best part of this whole dinner was the EXCELLENT professionalism and catering of the staff! Thank you! He is the training coordinator for the employees here and that's probably the smartest move this company has probably made! Way to have someone as personable, knowledgeable, kind & enthusiastic as LAMAD."}
{"text":"Father's Day we went around 8pm wasn't that busy but waited a few minutes for a table, we were seated and waited longer than expected for someone to greet us and get our drink order. Serve came got us our bread which was very good and took drink, appetizer order. 
Appetizer was delivered promptly and shortly after meals arrived, food was hot and very tasty. The service was just slow but sever was nice just seemed like they were all running around but it wasn't that busy, and so all in all they need to work on customer service and checking on the guests."}
{"text":"Service was ok nothing special. I'm really disappointed by the food quality and pricing. $85 for 3 meals. The 5 oz (half a palm) steak had a side of 3 pieces of sliced potatoes and ground broccoli. The mac and cheese kids meals were literally just half a bowl. 6/10 might not go here again."}
{"text":"This is my first time at a Macaroni Grill.  Have always heard bad things about the ones in LA...  The food is mediocre.  For the price range, it's a good value.  The bad service can only be credited to this location.  Note to our waiter, if you are buttering up the next table to make sure you get a fat tip, make sure you are not sticking your butt in the face of the paying patron at the next table.  And, while you do the buttering up, if you must squeeze through 3 times, don't bump the chair of the said patron 3 times.  The bread we asked for never showed up until we asked the manager for it.  The manager only showed up to insist that the flatbread is supposed to show up mostly burnt.  Lastly, the bus boy person has mastered the skill of tossing the plates to the right setting with a loud bang.  It's amazing that the plates didn't shatter.  She should enter the Olympics.  My husband said we should tip anyways so we tipped 15%.  However, I think that's going to keep him up tonight as he has major regret."}
{"text":"Took my mother in law here for her birthday and wasn't overly impressed. The prices were a bit high for Italian and a chain. The portion sizes were also a bit on the small side.

I did not care for their bread service, which was rosemary with olive oil. I asked for butter and did think that was better.

The salad course was okay. They push their caesar salad, but you can get a regular tossed salad.

I had the chicken scaloppini which was good."}
{"text":"My wife, 10 month old baby and I came here one evening for dinner on a trip to Henderson to visit friends. We were seated promptly and offered beverages right away. One of the servers sang Italian opera and showtoons and she was amazingly talented! Turns out that she used to have a show on the strip. It definitely showed and our daughter was enraptured with as she sang to her, it was very sweet. We had Appetizers, the baked prosciutto with mozzarella. Salty, but isn't that how prosciutto is supposed to be? for main dishes We had seabass and penne pasta with red sauce. was great as always and the place seemed very well run with polite service. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Listen, its good for what it is. I knew I wasnt getting authentic Italian here. Im no fool. But, in a pinch before a movie, it really wasnt bad at all.  We ordered the Baked Mozzarella wrapped in Prosciutto in a tomato sauce.  Bread came to the table at first and a small  bowl of seasoned olive oil for dipping. The baked Mozzarella was very chewy mozzarella melted with prosciutto and it was just too much cheese for me. I dont know what I was thinking. It tasted good but I just cant. We ordered the meatballs and they came in a red sauce with a dollop of ricotta on top. Not, bad. They were a little hard, but they had a nice taste. Dont get me wrong, theyre not MY meatballs, but they were fine. What I WAS surprised at, was the Lasagna that the hubs had the nerve to order!! That was surprisiingly good. The noodles were perfectly cooked, the sauce was tomatoey and flavorful, nicely seasoned, chock full of cheese and meat. I have to say we enjoyed this place. Listen, no one cooks like me, especially since I'm Italian, but for you people who dont know better, this place is tops. Mangia!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. We went for lunch and had the italian nachos, which were yummy. They also have a combo special that is a good deal."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a number of times over the last 5 years or so.  Yesterday was my first trip back in about a year.

Service:  Exceptional.  Our server was Brent, and he is a very pleasant, personable waiter.  He was always on it when it came to refilling my water, and delivered our food as quickly as the kitchen could get it out. (see below)

Food: 
Appetizer:  This time we had the baked olives.  This is a new appetizer, and I absolutely approve.  Salty kalmattas, and other various olives, baked with a tiny bit of parm on top...absolutely delicious.  

Salads:  
My friend and I ordered salads as our mains. 
I had the chicken caesar, he ordered the warm spinach salad with scallops instead of shrimp.

The cook was new, and apparently wasn't quite ready for the 6 tickets that came in at the same time...he made my friend's salad with shrimp, so our server had to tell him to remake it with scallops this time.  
My friend and I watch a LOT of Gordon Ramsay, and so when we saw the plate go back as soon as it was set up on the pass, we knew they had to refire scallops.  No biggie, really, although it wasn't super busy in there...we're pretty understanding people though. 

When the salads came, mine was delicious.  If I had to make one complaint, I'd say that it was just a touch too heavily dressed.  I ate almost every bite anyway. :D

My friend's salad was missing the proscuitto, but Brent brought some out for us.  After that was added, his salad was delicous as well.  The scallops were delightful, and I am PICKY about scallops.  

It was a great experience.  I will come back again for sure.  I've never had bad service, and the food has always been good when I come."}
{"text":"We like the food and prices are reasonable. Our biggest complaint is the service. It took a bit long to get a server to come over and then it took our server a while to get our bread and drinks. They really need to develop a better sense of teamwork.  While waiting for things there were numerous servers standing around gabbing. It really gave us the impression of \"Not my table.\" \"Not my problem.\" Only other complaint is they need to get some rinse aid for the dishwasher. I had to dry our bread plates when the hostess gave them to us.

Ok so it's about 2 years since the previous review and not much changed. Our server tonight was not very good. We waited longer than we should have for her to come over and take our drink order. After waiting a long time for the drinks, they came and I had an incorrect beverage. She finally came back after 10 minutes and when I told her the drink was wrong, she laughed that she had given my drink to someone at another table. I was wondering why she waited for me to point that out to her when she had known that for several minutes.  I asked her for a straw when she brought the replacement beverage and it took about 10 minutes to get that. We put in our order and it  seemed to take a long time for the appetizer. We saw our dinner come up from the kitchen because we were sitting right next to the area by the open kitchen. Our server was busy stacking bowls and plates and we watched our food just sit there. During this time there were lots of servers and employees kind of standing around and no one bothering to bring us our dinner. When our dinner was finally brought over, you will be shocked to find out all the pasta was iced cold. We had to go up to the staff who was busy chatting and ask for a manager. He was apologetic to us, but when he went back to the open kitchen, we could hear him laughing at us with the chef. (Seriously, like he forgot this is an open kitchen area.). The server came over and was mortified that we had spoken to the manager. She never once apologized for anything.  He brought our pasta back and it was--meh. A lot of the noodles were stuck together and we don't think we got the garlic oil sauce we had ordered.  Another manager came over and told us he comped our two dinners which was the right thing to do, but we are not in a hurry to go back there."}
{"text":"I remember why it's been over ten years since I've eaten here.  My food was bland, my daughters meal was the wrong meal, my son IL pizza looked like a frozen one one would  have been better  and the kids Mac and cheese is actually ziti noodles with a cheese sauce.  Since we grub Hubbed the meal there wasn't a lot we could do.  Grub Hub offered a refund of the wrong meal but I don't know how long it takes to get it in the account.  The bread was good though and that's all I have to say good about the food.  I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"The food sucked!  The Calimari was disgusting and my canniloni tasted like it came out of a frozen box.  My water was good. Servers, you're supposed to serve, so prepare the table for the food to be brought out so we don't have an uncomfortable guessing game while you hold a hot plate over my head."}
{"text":"Not fond of chains in general, but this place is worth reviewing.

The atmosphere at this location is dark, romantic, yet casual and comfortable. Our server \"Richard\" was a riot and served us well as he entertained us throughout the night. This goes to show how much a server can influence your overall dining experience. We also had fun drawing on the table top (which is topped with white paper and crayons for your artistic expression).

The bread is really good here for those of us that fear no carbs. The salad was crisp and refreshing, and dinner was near perfection with my Lobster Ravioli melting in my mouth. My girlfriend's Lasagna was about as big as her head (9 layers) and made for delicious leftovers.

Two thumbs up for Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Hostess was distracted, server was present but not helpful. Table looked terrible, tablecloth didn't fit and paper was not folded completely. Seasonings that used to go in olive oil for the bread were absent from the table. Not many vegetarian choices. Expensive. Restrooms are disturbingly ugly. Sink faucets didn't even match. Doors were sticky. My daughter's pasta was not served with enough sauce and we had to ask for more. Pasta was cooked well but was not made fresh. Only reason I'm giving two stars is because the vodka sauce and alfredo sauce were both very tasty."}
{"text":"After a much glorified recommendation from the waiter too get the pork c hop special, result was 4 dried out chops, 4 undercooked risottos ( which they replaced with something else, ours were the last they had for the night). After mention of the chops drones, we're told they would melt in mouth, that was not going to happen with those chopsn we were offered free dessert. Took it home, tiramisu, will taste in the AM for breakfast. Disappointing as previous visit was actually quite good. Fifth person had the meatballs, said they were good.

Appetizers muscles were good as was the soup."}
{"text":"I would really like to give this location a better review, but I'm torn. We go here frequently for lunch and usually enjoy it. 

Unfortunately every time we try to eat dinner here there is a wait. The food at Macaroni Grill is fine, just not worth waiting 30 minutes for, especially when there are an abundance of empty tables throughout the restaurant. It can't be that hard to hire sufficient staff to wait on customers."}
{"text":"The entire experience was disappointing.  After we sat down, it took almost 10 minutes for our waiter to come to our table even though the restaurant was not crowded.  When he finally came, he never gave us a drink menu or offered us a drink.  We watched all of the tables who came in around us get bread, but our waiter never brought bread.  When we asked for bread a few minutes after placing our order, the waiter claimed our bread was in the oven.  Since the kitchen is open, we were tempted to go take our own salads from the kitchen.  Although we saw the salads being made, our waiter did not bring the salads over for another 10 minutes.  Our entrees came out approximately three minutes after we received our salads.  Our waiter never recognized that there was an issue with his service, but the waiter who delivered the entrees realized that we just received our salads when he brought the entrees.

The restaurant does not appear to be well managed at all.  While there appeared to be managers in the restaurant, they never once came to the table or recognized what a poor job our server was doing.

Overall it was a terrible experience and the food is sub-par at best.  I definitely would not visit this location again and likely would not eat at another Macaroni Grill again.  When the service and food are both bad, there is no reason to go back."}
{"text":"My waiter is a ghost. Food here is always grand. I order the parmesan sole. Never disappoints. 

Okay, disappointed in the service. Bread was cold. Risotto was fine, but not the best. Sole was warm along with the side of broccoli which was actually cold.

Why didn't I tell my waiter, took too long to be served and.....I'm hungry! He can see that I have not touched the broc. He is very busy with the large table. Also, he only asked when he was passing by. He never stopped to communicate with me.

He places my food on the table from the other side of the table. I'll take a pic.

Well, it had been years since I stopped in for a meal at Mac. I would give them another try. The sole meal has always been good. Just not today);

Hoping you fair better than I did."}
{"text":"Certainly for that price you pay for each meal, you would think that the food would be great. It was terrible! I went for my birthday celebration. The server acted like she hated life and didn't want to be there. The truffle mac was 99% truffle oil and 1% cheese and noodles. Disgusting. Save your money! Do not waste your time. Heart attack on a plate!!!"}
{"text":"Ok . . . It's Father's Day . . . and Dad get to choose the Restaurant . . . YEAH . . . not really . . . no one liked my choices . . . with that said . . . the Family agreed on Romano's Macaroni Grill . . . haven't been here in a couple of years . . . but we'll give it a go, because when we lived closer it was one of our GO TO Restaurants.

BIG MISTAKE . . . read some reviews prior to getting here and so I was getting a little worried . . . but here is the scoring.

Service  -  1 STAR  -  Our server was great, very attentive.

Appetizers  -  0 STAR  -  Marcaroni and Cheese bites GOOD / Prochutto and Mozzarella tasted like a salt lick / Margarita Pizza was stewed tomatos on flat bread, tasteless and cheeseless.

Main Course - 0 STAR - Lasagna tasted old and very very dried out / Shimp Alfedo was sauceless and 4 pieces of shrimp / Chicken Alfredo made the Shrimp Alfred look great.

Desert - 0 Star - Cheesecake was dry and the edges looked and were hard as rock / tirramisu was tastless

Ambience - 0 Stars - dusty pictures / food stained menus / dirty plates on tables.

Sure wish I know what happened to this place . . . it use to be GREAT . . . now it looks like a place that has fallen on hard times . . . bland / dry italian food food (what happened to the great sauces that use to exist here) and an overall staff that seemed pretty lifeless.

Sad to say . . . I probably will not be back."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Always great food and great service.   If you like Italian food you must come check this place out.  

I love the lasagna and the selection of wine. Very highly recommended"}
{"text":"If I rated this place solely on overall ambiance I'd give it a three star then there was that surly waiter -1 and most of all the food was just meh (not great,  just meh) -1 grand total of 1"}
{"text":"The ladies from work and I went here for our monthly night out together. We requested a large table for 10 of us and also another table since we were doing a gift exchange as well and wanted a place to put the gifts. They easily accommodated us and we were even in an area that is somewhat separate from the rest of the restaurant, right in front of the fireplace, which really added ambiance to our little Christmas gathering. The service was okay although the server was unaware they had begun offering gluten free pasta the month before. I did order a pasta meal with the GF noodles, they were good but as I often find with restaurants that offer GF pasta, there was no GF garlic bread to go with. I really wish more Italian restaurants would go the extra mile to offer gluten free garlic bread with a GF meal, it would really make someone's meal so much more enjoyable. All in all a good meal and fun evening."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on a Saturday later in the evening for dinner, the parking lot didn't seem to full, it was pretty easy finding a spot. As soon as we walked in the door they were completely packed but that didn't stop the customer service at all, we were immediately greeted and taken care of, ice cold water, and fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

I ordered Mama's Trio what a ton of food, the portions are amazing! Chicken Parmesan, Lasagna Bolognese, and Chicken Cannelloni, everything was great, I couldn't come close to finishing all of this, so at home I had this for dinner the next day as well!

She ordered the Chicken Parmesan and I was a little jealous because that was my favorite out of all three. It comes with chicken that is crisp on the outside but juicy and moist on the inside, topped with cheese, sitting next to thin angel hair spaghetti, the whole plate is about 91 grams of protein and 129 grams of carbs so it's a great meal after working out if you're looking to add mass.

I have to say this is one of my favorite places for dinner, with the great customer service and great food, I can't see how anyone has anything to complain about."}
{"text":"First time to this place and it was fantastic! Wife's steak salad came out a little pinker than she liked and it was promptly taken care of. All of the food was amazing. Tania made it a very enjoyable first experience. After bringing the bill, she noticed the military ID card and said she was going to take care of the bill and add the discount. Definitely recommend this place to anyone. Thank you Tania!"}
{"text":"Horrible food my first and last time , the chicken was uncooked and had a nasty plastic taste , won't ever go back"}
{"text":"They have the worst service I have ever experienced. I went here while I was 7 months pregnant with my husband and it took 50 minutes to sit down and another 1ht before  e we're even brought drink orders. We decided to leave and eat at Chili's instead.

Tonight, I ordered for delivery and after waiting over an hour, they decided to refuse the order to the driver after it was already prepared. When I called I spoke with Heather and she told me yes and? What kind of service is that? I'm so disappointed with the company. I will never order here again and I will advise everyone I know of the same thing."}
{"text":"Menu did change a bit.food is ok service is a coin toss,you get someone who cares about getting a good tip or a person who just likes the way they look in uniform. Overall it's better than olive garden or applebees"}
{"text":"I arrived here at 11:55 and asked the hostess if I could sit at the booths by the bar. She said yes and assured me that someone would wait on me shortly. It us now 1:15. Not so much as a glass of water. No service of any kind. 

California Pizza Kitchen is right around the corner. Guess where I'll be going?"}
{"text":"We had a table of 11 with 4 being under 10. Our waitress was incredible. She was very attentive even to the kids. My meal was very good. I had shrimp portofino. It was do good."}
{"text":"I should have checked Yelp before taking my wife to this place. It was a fairly slow Sunday evening, and we wanted a nice dinner for just the two of us. The hostess seemed completely untrained, didn't look us in the eye when she spoke (mumbled) to us. She tried to steer us into the bar for our meal, even though we told her we wouldn't be ordering drinks. She walked us to a booth, but barely spoke a word. Then we met our waiter, Jose. His accent is very very strong, but not Italian. We really struggled to understand him, and he clearly didn't know what he was doing. We eventually got some bread and water, and made our orders. The \"Trio\" plate I ordered included lasagna. My first bite was so cold I poked my finger into the middle of the serving...cold through and through (and I mean cold). They took it back, but by the time my replacement plate arrived, my wife was about finished. We will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went to an early dinner today. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant, and after 10 minutes of being ignored by the host, we left.  This is my first time back here in a couple of years, and will never go again."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was not. All the pasta for our party was undercooked; there were 14 of us. Other customers also were returning meals. The manager told us they were using a new pasta and had to \"learn to cook it\". She did make an adjustment on our bill to make up for the bad meals."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been here & used to eat here frequently.  Nice, clean place, service was good.  Austin, our waiter, was solid & was available but not always hanging over us.  

Food, however, was very mediocre.  I had spaghetti w/ meatballs in Pomodoro sauce and found it to be bland with little seasoning.  My wife had ratatouille which was underwhelming.  Our kids enjoyed their cheese pizzas, though.

These four meals with no drinks (needed water from walking around Desert Ridge) was $45.  Given the quality of the food, found this to be too expensive.  Would've given 2 stars, but Austin earned them the extra star.

I'm the unlikely event we ever go back, I'll have the pizza.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience today!! We went for the $7.00 lunch in 7 minutes or less or it's free deal. I ordered the sausage penne dish and it was super good!! The sausage is just yummy and it has fresh quality mushrooms!! My hubby ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It had amazing flavor and was a bit spicy (warning) and tasty, but it was served cold. I recommend the sandwich, but recommending asking for it to be hot (we found out that they will serve it hot upon request). Damn, add a fresh loaf of rosemary bread for only $1.00!!

We were WOWED by our service!! It started with Xavier, our cashier. It was his first day on his own on the register. He was a delightful and engaging guy who is an obvious good choice for the job!! It was a bit slow as we arrived when the doors opened. He popped by to check on us and we thought that was cool! Our super server was Stephen and he genuinely CARED about our experience! To top it off, the general manager Alexis came by to ask if we were happy with our meal, and we let her know we certainly were happy! All of the employees were super and made us feel welcomed and appreciated even though we didn't spend much! We did, however, tip more than typical because of the outstanding experience!!"}
{"text":"Romano's tries hard, and I give them credit for that. This wasn't a horrible dining experience. Probably closer to a 2.5 star. But it certainly wasn't fantastic. I ordered the carbonara and despite it being \"hand made\" and fresh and including an egg on it, it just didn't hit on all cylinders for me. It was rather light on flavor. Part of that is my fault for ordering carbonara: a dish I'm always more disappointed in than I remember.

Service was decent, though our waitress wasn't aware that they apparently served Orangina. \"I think they're just decorative.\" Me: \"They're in 24-packs stacked up in between those huge tables there. I think they're for sale.\" (They were.)

Overall, you get what you expect here, and I wasn't expecting much. Mission accomplished, though my mother enjoys some salad thing they do, and again, it wasn't *awful*. It just wasn't great."}
{"text":"So we decided to celebrate our son's excellent grades with a dinner out. Mac Grille seemed a nicer choice than others so we stopped by. We made sure to get there early to avoid the crowds.  The problem was that Mac Grille seems to schedule wait staff very thinly at the beginning of the evening. So our waitress was the hostess! She didn't know much past where to seat us but gave her all in the attempt until the overloaded waitress stopped by to take over.  Despite it, both the hostess and the waitress were very pleasant and professional throughout. Shame on Mac Grille for understaffing though.

To the food! Meh.

My wife had something called Carmela's Chicken. It was a nice looking bowl of rigatoni, chicken, mushrooms and other assorted goodies. She seemed to enjoy it but I found it to be fairly ordinary. As a guy who cooks professionally, I am always looking to be blown away with flavor or at the very least something that I didn't think to make at home. It could have used a little salt (especially in the pasta boiling water) to bring out the nice semolina taste in the noodles. The important thing is that she liked it and was happy.

I got Mama's Combo. A plate with lasagna, chicken parm and a chicken and mushroom cannelloni. The cannelloni was pretty good the lasagna was the star of the plate but the chicken parm was a pure throw away. I was unaware of where on the chicken a round disc of breast meat comes from (probably right nest to the nugget!). If I was to bet my last dollar on something to regain my vast fortune I would place it on the fact that the chicken came straight out of a box, already breaded and cooked and flash heated and put on the angle hair. Very disappointed. Did really enjoy the lasagna bolognese, though.

So, who knows, maybe one day we go back, but honestly I don't think we will feel on our deathbeds that we missed out on anything special if we never stop by again. Shame.

Also, just FYI, they were out of 2 of the 4 tap beers walking into a Friday night! Who does that? May as well run out of parmesan cheese! Oh yeah speaking of parmesan cheese, I hate restaurants that have the server put the parm on your food in those grinders. Seems like if you like a lot of parm on your grub (like all of us) you are screwing it up for the other tables, so you allow them to leave too darned soon and you are left wanting more but felling a bit shy and embarrassed to ask them to come back and pile on some more. Just sayin.

Eat Well!!!!!!

{"text":"Lousy service..lousy food...dollar menu at McDonald's would have been better..recently visited with family and my dad was bragging how delicious macaroni grille..mind you he hadn't eaten here for like 5+ years..lets just say it was embarrassing and my dad was sure to inform the manager of how terrible their service has become..they gave us a small discount and appetizer coupons which we tossed immediately..so folks I don't recommend this restaurant..eat anywhere else"}
{"text":"Last time, I gave this place 4 stars about a year ago because I was pretty pleased. Came back and our server/hostess Danny was so amazing I just had to go back and update my review. Simply due to her customer service, how attentive she was to both myself and my preggo bff, between the food and everything else I had to give this place 5 stars! My bff and I are definitely going to come back more often simply because this lady made our experience so memorable. Thank you Danny!"}
{"text":"My friend and I used to come here after class to grab a quick lunch to eat. Anyways the lunch menu is around $8-12 depending what choices you get.  The portions were good enough but it was short of amazing.  Personally, I liked the pasta it was descent.  I wouldnt mind going back here again, I thought. 

We came back again to RMG again during lunch and came back to a horrible experience.  We were seated near the bar area and it took like 15minutes for someone to finally realize we were there and when the server took our orders. It was about 25-30minutes till we got our food and it was cold when it arrived.  We ended up not finishing the food and waited for the server to come back.

He asked how everything was and we let him know that the food was cold and the service was not great.  He comped our meal and we left.  From then, I knew I wouldnt come back here again.  

However, about a week ago I went back to have lunch there again since it has been almost a year since I havent gone back to RMG and it finally concluded the fact why I wouldnt want to come back here again. 

The complimentary bread was hard and not tasteful.  We ordered the $2 entrees for $25 ( two appetizers and two entrees) we ordered the mac & cheese bites some other appetizer. Both appetizers tasted bland and it seemed like it was just microwaved.  The entrees were average, its only good if youre hungry but other than that, go somewhere else to fill your appetite for italian food."}
{"text":"I could eat Penne Rustica all say every day!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been back to Macaroni Grill, so many better places for Italian! But I got an email for their $7 lunches, for a few days they'd be 2 for $10! So I talked some girls into trying it out at lunch, especially since they have a 7 minute guarantee, get your meal in 7 minutes or it's free. Our lunch hour is strict, so we have to watch our minutes.
You order at the counter, they give you a number, take a  table. They bring your drinks and food to the table. Service was friendly, a little sloppy but most of us got our food in the 7 minute time. They did refund the one that was delayed, we had to tell them. We all shared bites of each others. The Chicken Panzanella Salad, Sausage and Mushroom Rigatoni, and Chicken Caesar \"calzone\" were delicious, worth $7 and I would certainly get them again. There weren't many customers even being between 12-1pm on a Thursday, so service was prompt. The \"Calzone\" beckones me back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit! My wife ordered the build your own pasta, it was bow tie with  roasted garlic, pine nuts tossed in spicy red sauce.  I had the Pork Shank with Rosemary Potatoes and Green-beans, it was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious!  The food server was ok he told too many jokes and never refilled our water glass!  Eugene the manager  did a pretty good job, checking on the tables making sure everyone was taking care of.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious our server was outstanding we had a great time.  I would recommend the Seabass the red wine was delicious, salad the service what a great experience, we had a wonderful experience and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to stop here for a late lunch.  When we entered, there were several people waiting in the front area but the dining area was less than 1/2 full.  After standing unnoticed for several minutes, we were just about to walk out when a hostess apologized for the wait and informed us that there are not enough servers to serve the entire dining area so there would be about a 15 min wait.  No problem, so we sat in the waiting area with the others.  After a couple seconds, I couldn't help but notice the extremely high-pitched, continuous noise coming from the kitchen equipment.  As much as I tried to block it out, I found myself getting almost an instant headache, which is quite rare for me.  It was at this instant that I decided this just wasn't worth the wait, no matter how good the food is! So we left and went to Chili's a couple doors down :)"}
{"text":"I love macaroni grill wish we had one in kingman it would be busy all the time. We went here for lunch and the only reason I did not give 5 stars is because we had pretty slow service and they had the air conditioning so darn cold it made our food get cold so fast and we were freezing. But the good points the restaurant was very clean and busy and there was so much food we split our lunch and both got full. We had the chicken scaloppine and it was to die for I mean I gotta get that recipe so I can make it at home. We could not stop eating it even though we were both full we both cleaned our plate and I could have licked mine it was that good. It has lots of chicken in it and thin noodles a light lemon cream sauce and artichokes, capers and thin ham also you get a Cesar salad and hot Rosemary bread. Wow I will be sure to go here again when I am in Las Vegas. I wanted to visit here on my return trip home to have the same thing but I missed my exit darn it.. Oh well I will be back be sure to try this it is Devine"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying our waitress Paula made this visit as great as it could be. However on the food side of things I wasn't pleased. The create your own pasta I had ordered was missing the fresh Mozzerella which was later brought out but adding cold wet cheese to hot pasta wasn't the best combination. Next there was WAY to much fresh garlic in the two pastas that had it. The lasagna we ordered tasted like it was microwaved and they completely forgot about our fired Mac and cheese bites. But still three stars because service was just that awesome. Without our waitress that would have been a one star visit"}
{"text":"Maria our server was amazing.  Most pleasent lunch experience we've had.  She was smiling the entire time. The Food Was delicious aswell but the service is what stood out the most. She was prompt and even genuinely laughed at my husbands attempts at bad jokes.. (bad meaning cheesey) All around she was great and wanted to show some kind of thanks and hope she gets the recognition she deserves.  Thank you Maria for making our lunch special.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ick.

I still have a bad taste in my mouth from it.  Literally and figuratively.   

We used to go here ALL the time; it was my mom's favorite restaurant.  The last few times we've been here, we have had less than good experiences but thought maybe it was a fluke.  I

Tonight, we started off with the Romano's Sampler appetizer to get the 4 of us started. This included Tomato Bruschetta, Fresh Mozzarella Fritta and Calamari Fritti served with arrabbiata sauce for $9.99.  Please see picture.  I've seen cafeteria food prepared more nicely than this.  Gross.  I don't ever complain, but my sister thought it was a joke so asked our server.  His response was very matter of fact telling us that 'with the order of Mozzarella you only get three pieces for $7.'  I don't know if that was supposed to make us feel better but he didn't agree with us that it looked terrible.  I would have never taken that to a table as a server, but the way he acted led me believe that this is not abnormal.  Yuck.

For my meal, I ordered the Pasta Milano which is the same dish I get nearly every time I've eaten here because it's never let me down.  It was much smaller in portion than I have ever received, however it has like 124g of fat in it, so I'm totally fine with that.  The weird, gross thing about it was that someone was really angry while tenderizing the chicken cause they beat it into something that I can only compare to a paper-thin rice cake.    I had to double check that it, in fact was chicken.  I've never had it of that texture and consistency before.  Eew.  

Service was average.  I'm won't find each thing to complain about cause most of you aren't reading anymore, however I will say that I don't think anyone in my family will be going back here.  The food (and service) has been steadily declining during the last few years; not sure if new management or what.  But that will be our last time to attempt it to see if it has improved. 

Bill was $70 for four (no alcohol and before tip and AFTER our sampler was taken off).    Double gross.  

Sorry Macaroni Grill.  You got my first 1 Star."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Our server Kiersa was great! Definitely recommend this location. My husband and I have been to several other locations and this one always has the best food. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Eh, neither impressed nor disappointed. Our server was friendly and attentive and knew the menu well. The atmosphere is nice and everything feels clean. The food was good,  but nothing super special. The menu was smaller than i expected and didnt have as.many pasta choices as I was hoping for. We chose 2 apps (they were 2 for 9.95), mac and cheese bites and fried zucchini. Both were okay, but I woulnt miss them if we skipped them next time. The entrees were better. They came out fast and were very generous portions. I tried a new dish, buffalo chicken parm, and was able to substitute the angel hair pasta for rigatoni. The pasta my boyfriend and I both has was very good and the sauces were pretty delicious. My chicken was really spicy which was nice but the edges were fried too much for my liking. 

Overall, dinner here was okay. I think it compares pretty close to Olive Garden, just with a smaller menu. I'd try it again and maybe recommend it a friend."}
{"text":"We have been here since 7 o'clock. It is now 8:41 and we have not received our FOOD!!!!  If there was a star for bad service.....I would give them -5 . There is no one to help anyone !! This place sucks and can't get anything right. I wonder what they are going to charge us!!! Stay tune!!! 
It's 931 and we have not received our bill!!! They are breaking each bill by each person in our party.!! Oh he just showed up with bill!!! 932pm"}
{"text":"After reading all the so-so reviews, I was quite hesitant to try this Macaroni Grill, but I went anyway and I'm glad I did.

The service by Vinny was very friendly, upbeat and helpful. The warm bread out of the oven was great. The only thing I did not care for was the olive oil, which I found to be very bitter.

I find it helpful that the menu lists calorie information for each dish. I ordered the Pollo Caprese which consists of a grilled chicken breast served with capellini pasta and supposedly imported buffalo mozzarella and also accompanied by a \"signature\" side Caesar salad. The entree was very tasty and the chicken was grilled perfectly and the portion was plentiful. 

The prices are average, the menu selection is quite large offering everything from pastas, salads, meats, chicken dishes and even pizza. Even though the restaurant was quite busy at the time of our 7:00 pm reservation, it is not very noisy and the dining room is warm and inviting and the service was great."}
{"text":"Did I just really eat there!?   Dirty.  Bad service.  Gross.  Way over priced for the terrible food.  Would have left immediately when the table and plates and silverware were dirty but did not want to embarrass my friend.  Our server tried but YUCK."}
{"text":"This place used to easily be OK, but now, not so much. Food and service this visit were disappointing. We were celebrating my wife's birthday on a Monday night and this was her choice. I called in earlier in the night to see if they had a table available for a party of 9 and the hostess told me that we didn't have to bother because they were slow and they would have plenty of tables. We arrived at 7 and the restaurant was about a third full.

Anthony was our server and he had some ups and downs with more downs. Many things did not make our experience more enjoyable, such as: not offering a wine list and just offering wines off the top of his head, not acknowledging latecomers to our party and having them sit there without a drink for 10 minutes, repeatedly jumping into the table conversation with irrelevant comments, and not pre-busing our table throughout the meal leaving the table cluttered and taking the plates away in a big pile making himself look like a clown doing a balancing act.

The service from the kitchen was far from stellar also. Our 9 entrees came out in three different phases with some food, including my entree being close to room temperature. This meant there was no communication in the kitchen with entrees not timed and some left dying in the window. Of course, the birthday girl's spaghetti was dragging at least 5 minutes late which meant it was simply missed by the cooks. This left everyone at the table in that uncomfortable position: \"Should we eat? Should we wait?\" 

The bread, stuffed mushrooms, olives, and my mother's eggplant parm were the only items worth mentioning that were good. Other  items ordered were my branzino, chicken parm, calbrese steak, shrimp caesar salad, and cannelloni bolognese. None of those items stood out and no one said they were impressed.

This was a lesson that cost me $240. You've got infinite choices within a two mile radius. We will be exercising those options from now on, as should you."}
{"text":"Lamad is honestly the best server ever. He makes sure everything is perfect and that you are happy with it. He cracks jokes and makes it feel more homie. We never have a bad time with him! 

Got the blackened chicken, and it was amazing! I would recommend those roasted little cherry tomatoes to go with it. It's kind of funny, every time my family goes we get the same table with the same amazing server!"}
{"text":"I have been once in a while even though it is closer to where I live.  It is not my favorite place.  However I do give them a three stars for effort for the last visit.  The food was adequate.  The calamari was very small.  Server was attentive and noticed my facial expressions got the manager involved to fix the problem.  The food was like any other franchise place nothing particularly special.  Shout out to the service!  The only reason why anyone should go here is because their service was excellent. For food however... it was okay."}
{"text":"There were 4 of us for dinner we had reservations, got seated immediately. The waiter Michael was great prompt and attentive. The food was just as we ordered and delicious. Dessert was good too. We will be back, it was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Pasta was overlooked. Sauce was pretty weak. Caesar salad was weak little serving. Hard to believe other reviewers think this good food. This is chain restaurant imitation Italian food."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but give me balsamic, bread, and crayons, and I'm happy.

It's probably not technically the most chic place to go, but it sure is fun after work with co-workers.  And to think the waitstaff learned to write upside down in two crayons.  That's talent.  I always seem to get an awesome wait-person and the dishes are satisfactory.

Big group of tired, overworked adults = crazy jokes and semi-loud laughing.  And we didn't even order any alcohol.  The staff didn't seem to mind us there, so we were ultra comfortable making our lunch last longer."}
{"text":"Oh how they tried... I think we got dwarfed by a larger party next to us because we were virtually forgotten.  We waited a while to get a drink orders,  waited a while to get the drinks,  waited a while to place our food order,  waited a while to get the food.  One lady in my party never got her food order.  Had to flag down the manager as she came over to check on the other table.  She was very apologetic.  Got the salad right out!  We requested refills,  twice... And another lady in my party asked for ice several times before she just gave up, never receiving any.  While I seriously don't think it was personal,   the service was extremely poor.  And I found the food was sub par after all the hoopla I've heard about the place.  Let's just state for the record that I don't ever have to go back."}
{"text":"Wasn't very busy when we came in so we got seated immediately at a booth. I've never been here before so I was expecting different types of macaroni..boy was I wrong. 

I like places with natural lighting, especially since we came during the day...this place had horrendous lighting, it looked like they bought the cheapest light bulbs which makes everything yellow.

Our server looked like he hated his life and wanted to die. He took our drink order and came back with this loaf of bread and sort of just plopped it on our table and left, which sort of pissed me off. The bread was nice and fluffy though!

We had a table of 3 so we got the portobello fries for an appetizer and then shrimp scampi, signature truffle Mac and cheese, and a Caesars salad with chicken. 

The portobello fries were alright...not something I would order again. There was way too much breading on it, I couldn't even taste the portobello. I've had better.

It took little while for our food come out but it all came at the same time so that was understandable. The shrimp scampi was drowning in oil but other than that, it was pretty good. The Mac and cheese was quite heavy but it had a lot of flavor to it. 

All of our drinks were near empty and our server was no where to be found. Instead, another server got us refills. We all finished eating and waited long enough for one of us to start getting annoyed before our server came back to get our check. He offered us dessert and seemed upset that we didn't want any. 

I'm sure I would've liked this place a lot more if we got a different server. Sadly, I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"It's funny how we ended up checking yelp only to see if bad service is the norm here. Guess now we understand. The acceptable attire I.e hair styles are comparable to fast food joints. Short sleeves and all tatted up manager is not setting the example. We won't put our server on total blast but how would you feel if one of your apps that you ordered never made it out until the other one was fully eaten. It wasn't surprising to see that one of our entrées didn't come out until the other one was fully eaten as well. We ended up getting a bunch of I'm sorry's but A sign of true concern and understanding would have been at the very least a small discount on the meal. Obviously this did not happen. There are plenty of other restaurants on Stephanie and this place seriously needs to work on it's service standards."}
{"text":"Never again, I say. My in-laws insisted on having their 50th anniversary dinner party at Romano's Macaroni Grill (I-17 and L-101 area) last weekend with 20+/- attendees. I would like to say that this experience was most likely an anomaly; however, this is my third consecutive disappointing experience at a Phoenix-based RMG (all different locations in Phx-metro area) over the last 6-months. Never again...not even with a free gift-card will I set foot in a RMG. I am very sad because RMG used to be so good and dependable. 

Issues/Concerns: 
1. Dinner party was seated 20-minutes before any water or bread was brought out. First came the water, then 20-minutes later the bread, then 20-mintues later the drink order, then 20-mintues later the meal orders, then 20-minutes later the appetizers, and so on. I'm okay with a leisurely dining pace, but this was ridiculous. 

2. Initially only one wait-staff was assigned to our group of 20 until we complained to someone. From that point on, we had 1.5 wait-staff assigned. I don't fault the wait-staff; they appeared to be doing their best. 

3. We were very lucky to get the separate dining area, so had a lot of privacy after the one other occupied table departed. For the entire duration of our stay (over 2-hours), that dirty table remained loaded with dirty dishes and uneaten food even though the restaurant was relatively slow. 

4. We never did see the shift-manager. One would think that with a party of 20, a $400 dinner-tab on an otherwise slow Sunday afternoon, with a guaranteed 18% gratuity included in the bill, that had been pre-booked for 2-3 weeks in advance, that the management would exert a little extra effort to make sure our party was taken care of to make it a memorable event given it was such a special occasion for our parents. 

5. Brother-in-law requested the waitstaff to bring one bottle of red and one bottle of white wine for each of the two tables upon initial entry. 30-minutes later, after he asked again, it was brought out and set on end of the table with no offer to pour or serve. When we rang-out, we were surprised to see the normal house-wine charged at $30 per bottle...seems very high for house wine. 

6. We were all instructed to use the crayons and circle our menu choice on the menu sheets, like we were in 1st Grade. Very classy...not! 

7. Appetizers were generally tasty but portions seemed small. 

8. Many of the main course meals were disgusting (undercooked, cold, poor flavor, lacking any passion). For example, 
-I ordered Chicken Parmigiana. The angel hair pasta had vinegary-taste and was generally inedible. My Chicken Parmigiana entrée was edible, but i would submit that it was not to RMG's old-standards of excellence...I have had better hospital food. 

- My wife ordered a shrimp-based main course; her food was literally ice-box cold. 

- My son ordered lasagna; however, 10-minutes later they reported they were out of lasagna...really, RMG out-of-lasagna on a slow Sunday afternoon? He ended up with Pasta Alfredo, but the noodles were grossly underdone to the point of being crunchy. Same with my daughter-in-laws noodles. 

- I could go on, but you get the point. 

In my opinion, there are too many other dining choices in the Phoenix-area to waste any more of my time or money at Ramono's Macaroni Grill. Again, this makes me sad because I had some great dining experiences there when they first opened. In my opinion, the fish-stinks-from-the-head-down...this is a management issue that needs to be fixed by corporate."}
{"text":"just fattening dish after fattening dish... nothing turned me on besides the dirty martini which was still under average( i can say this cause i have had my fair share of good martinis)...

just blah in my opinion....not sure how i even ended up here.

just not a fan.... i can live w/out ...

two stars..one because im a kid at heart and like drawing on the tables with the crayons they provide..and the second star because well ,sheessh.. guess im just a nice gal."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, i did not pick this place, I would never have picked this place and honestly, I am amazed I like this place....I also sent my meal back...twice...And yet I still ended up liking this place, but more on that later.

One member of our family was asked where he would like to eat, he came up with Macaroni grill, as the family has been trying to get him to broaden his outlook on food, we were hamstrung, crappy wannabe chain store Italian food when we know a great Italian place (Bon Gusto)...Oh well.

The menu is simple, the classics are there, no major surprises.

Mr Expanding his outlook on food orders a...Pizza...FFS, it's at this point I wish Yelp had smiley icons, the one beating his head against a wall would work well.

The food.

Chicken under a brick....Surprisingly good, chicken was moist, it just needed a sauce to go with it.

Chicken Scaloppine... Very good, the sauce was actually one of the best Scaloppine sauce I have tried, shocking in fact.

Lasagna Bolognese.... Right, this is where it went pear shaped, firstly, nobody can make a better lasagna than my mother made, she took the receipt to the grave sadly, but it is rare that something comes close...and this wasn't one of those occasions, however, it is a darn good lasagna, certainly a dish I would order again.

However, two of us ordered it, they both came out, we were warned the dishes were hot..no worries, i have a nice view of the kitchen and they were not sitting under a heat lamp...So hot food right...Well no, both lasagnes came out ice cold, I don't mean cold, I mean like biting into a piece of ice. Waiter grabbed, food back to the kitchen, manager doing a very good job of saying sorry.

A quick break, this lady shows how it should be done, anyone who has eaten out a number of times knows that every now and again something will go wrong, the waiter is handling a hot plate, he will have no clue the food is cold so he gets a pass, but the manager explained that the situation shouldn't happen, and she did it in a way that actually came across as sincere, something some managers have a hard time doing.

Anyways, one lasagna comes back out, goes to the mother in law, perfect, nice and hot, then mine came out.....Not expecting it to still be made of ice I took a big bite and yes it was ice cold.

Here is a funny thing, the manager was standing in the kitchen watching me, we make eye contact, she can tell I am not...impressed...
Imagine the Flintstones carton, where Fred and Barney get in the car and their feet kick up a dust storm but they don't move, that was her, sadly, she didn't get to me before I managed to have a minor melt down....It's bad I know, but if food is sent back because it is cold, the dish going out to replace it should be hot, there should be no questions.

For some reason the waiter declined my offer to have him eat it, you know, just in case i was losing my mind and the food was actually hot, he actually looked shocked that  would make the nice friendly offer (again, Yelp, where are the smileys?)

Anyways, the manager made it to the table and well frankly, I think she is my long lost twin, she had the exact same look on her face that i do when an employee does something and I wonder \"WTF were you even thinking\" all while trying to keep a smile on her/my face for the customer.

5 minutes later she came out with the next lasagna, nice and hot.

I looked over at the kitchen, the chefs were all walking to the prep area behind the kitchen, I have to guess that the manager gave them a pep talk...Something along those lines.

Anyways, as we are finishing the meal, raving about the Scaloppine sauce my father in law mentions that it was rather strange that we had not seen the manager again.

She picked that moment to appear, both lasagnas are taken of the bill and the way she apologized again made it seem like she was more shocked that a cold meal came out of her kitchen not once, but twice, in other words, this is a lady who takes pride in the food, yes it may be chain store wanna be Italian, but it was clear she expects it to be done right.

Anyways, after a couple of failed attempts, it actually turned out to be a good meal, the food was surprisingly tasty, not amazing but it was better than I thought it would be. Service was good, drinks refilled quickly etc.

Would I go back, well honestly, it wouldn't be my first choice, but I wouldn't put up a fight if others wanted to go."}
{"text":"Look y'all, I grew up most of my life in the Philippines, okay? I eat a ton of weird shit. But I haven't even gotten through half of my pasta and I needed to go to the bathroom. I vomited up everything and whatever else was left. So, no, I do not recommend this place. The service was eh. I told my server that I immediately vomited my food and she said 'aww. Do you want a to go box?' Wtf"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.   Almost $100. For two of us. We each had a drink, those were good, the bread was good but our appetizer and dinner not so good.  My dish was fried and arrive barely warm.  It had been sitting while they finished my husbands dish which was okay but just okay.  The server forgot to mention that the salads are now not included with your meal, even though it clearly states on the menu.  I saw an advertisement on a dish that looked amazing, that's why we went there.  My dinner didnt look anything like the advertisement & didn't taste good either.  I didn't want to be that person who complains and has the manager over.  Kind of wish i had now.  The server knew we were finished & although it wasn't busy at all, we had to wait for our check until she finished a to go order.  Sometimes you have to think about who's waiting, and how to use your time more wisely.  We won't be going back there. It's not worth a second chance when there are so many other great restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place in a long time. Had bad service with the location in Goodyear. So far service is good. Food was good.  Location here off the I-17 and Loop 101 will have to visit again."}
{"text":"They changed the menu and removed some things I loved, also their food lacked the flavor it had before.  

Not sure why they changed the menu and the food quality is different too.  My sister and I  got a ribbon of fat on our Chicken Parmesan.  

It is for those reasons I have to change my ratings.  It's not a bad place, but a lot has changed.  None of it for the better.  It is no longer my go to.   I may just start going back to Cheddars across the street."}
{"text":"Great new fast lunch for $7! We had the chicken Parmesan which was great. Even my 3 year old really liked it! My husband had the chicken Milanese salad which was on top of a thin and lightly breaded chicken. The only improvement needed is the service. Once we got our food we had to track down someone if we needed anything else. No one came over. We also had to ask twice to get our dessert which took much longer than our lunch. No one cleared our table while we were waiting and none of the tables around us had been cleared either."}
{"text":"This is closer to 1 star, honestly. Meh!

I had a gift card for this place, and had never been, so we decided to have lunch here today.  After eating here, there is probably a reason I had never been here before, and after today, will probably never come back. 

We were greeted and seated pretty quick in a super comfy booth.  We got our drinks (Coke products), and the free bread they provide.  It was alright, but I am not the biggest fan of rosemary, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I probably should have.  For my entree, I went with the \"Mama's Trio\" which was chicken parmigana, lasagna, and fettuccine alfredo.   My wife did a \"create your own pasta dish\".  Here is how it was................

Mama's Trio- When it was set down in front of me, it looked really good.  Once I started eating the food though, it was a big letdown.  I will start with the good.....The chicken parmigana.  It was actually really good!  Piping hot, crispy, and had a good amount of melted cheese.  I wish I would have just ordered that as my entree.  I bit into the lasagna next.  Yuck!  May have been the worst lasagna I have ever had at a restaurant.  The lasagna was \"gummy\", and luke warm in the middle (probably should have sent it back).  The noodles were mush, the sauce wasn't that tasty, and the cheese was kind of just there.  I only ate about 2 bites of it.  Next, the fettuccine alfredo.  This too, was luke warm.  WTF?  Flavor of this was alright, but I couldn't get past the luke warm temperature of that.  Made fresh to order food....why are 2 items of the 3 luke warm/cold?  I took the lasagna and fettuccine to go, hoping to find a homeless person on the side of the road to give it to.  No such luck.  It is sitting in my fridge and is getting tossed out tomorrow.  Meh!   My wife didn't really like her pasta dish either.  It had a garlic butter sauce on it and it looked good, but there was an overpowering taste/scent of rosemary that killed the rest of the flavors.  Meh!

Service was just ok.  Not great, not bad.  Our waitress was having a little argument with one of the cooks about football or something.  We were in ear shot of the whole argument, and both of them were being incredibly stubborn and both were very adamant of \"being right\".  That shit should take place behind closed doors.  

Anyways....The main reason this gets 2 stars is the shitty food (minus the chicken parmigana...that is the only saving grace and why this gets 2 stars) and the damn price.  I had a $25.00 gift card, PLUS a $10 off $30.00 and after tax and tip our bill was still $18.00 out of pocket.  $53.00 for lunch (without coupons) is WAY TOO STEEP for this quality of food.  I was mad that I had to pay $18.00 out of pocket.  I'm sort of glad I came here to see what it was all about, but I know for sure I will never crave this place or come back to this location again.  Meh!"}
{"text":"Meh I've experienced better is the best way to describe this place.
 
Growing up I ate at MG grill many times, since it was right next to my house and the food was good so why not? That was when I was living in San Diego, then I moved to San Francisco where the closest MG was about an hour and a half away, so I rarely got to eat it. Maybe once or twice in the 10+ years I lived there. Recently I moved to Vegas and was excited that I could eat there as often as I once did. I always crave the mushroom ravioli-its the best! But, to my disappointment it wasn't as good as I remember, the mushrooms were rubberlike and the sauce was very watered down.

I had a really nice server, I forgot his name. But, the service was so slow. My beer came almost the exact time as my appetizer. The restaurant was not packed either, so not sure why it was so slow."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go while on vacation. I thought my grilled chicken & gluten free pasta was quite tasty! We only have have 1 location about 10 miles from home but never think of going there..... It was a nice treat as good Gluten Free Anything is hard to find ANYWHERE!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Party of 5. Got all of the orders wrong in some way. Food was cold. Server was new. Didn't refill drinks. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert. If they don't ask I don't suggest. It's their tip."}
{"text":"Our waitress Sam was excellent! She provided great suggestions on entrees and cocktails (mind you, I am picky when it comes to my drinks)! Not only did she make our service wonderful, but tonight as she checked my id for the drinks, she noticed today was my birthday and brought me a complimentary dessert (of my choosing)!
I recommend this location not just for the great food, but for the great hospitality/service you will receive when walking into this Romano's Macaroni Grill! Thank you Macaroni Grill, and thank you Sam for making my night wonderful!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly & nice. 
Stuffed mushrooms a little too peppery.   The food was rather unimpressive. My \"go to\" meal for years as been the pasta milano & husband's is the pasta rustica.  (We've been going to the chain together for over 12 years.)  Mine was not what it used to be-barely taste the sauce. I realize in this economy that they are trying things to save money, but they shouldn't to it at the expense of taste. Yuck. I used to love taking home left overs. This time, leaving it here."}
{"text":"Every part of my experience was awful.  Food was terrible and I'm not one to usually complain"}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan of Mac Grill- but within the past year I've eaten there three times and service has been awful. Actually worse than awful. Bordering on rude. You wait to get a table- 3 people walk by- can nobody say, \"we'll be right with you?\" Takes forever to place your order, then longer to get your food- even though with the open kitchen atmosphere you see your food sitting there getting cold. Last time I tried take-out. No better. Took me 15 minutes to get somebody to ring me out. And again, there's my food sitting there. Getting cold. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I liked it. They revamped the menu and removed the pics so I had to go on my phone to see what everything is. 
The bread is a bit more doughy than before, but the rest of the menu is pretty great. 
Their sauce is good, not tomato paste-sugar infused like in most places. My husband who is italian really loved it and did not complain at all. That's half a star right there. 
Everyone enjoyed it and our waitress sang for us and managed to bring everything hot out off the kitchen."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised the low reviews for this place. 
Very pleased with my service and our food. They have a few new menu items that are off the hook. 
Fig porkchop is to die for. Melted in my mouth. Cooked perfectly.

Manager Ryan came around to see how things were and he stayed to chat a moment. 

Will be back thank you!"}
{"text":"We haven't been there for quite awhile.  Everything has changed!  Much smaller menu with fewer selections, higher prices.  The usually delicious rosemary bread was dried out, the first loaf wasn't even warm.  The Folded Ravioli Pomodoro was different but not that flavorful.  We had to ask for refills of our drinks as wait staff didn't keep a very good eye on our table.  He was very eager to bring us our bill, never asking if we wanted desert, which we did.
He finally came back and took our order.  A couple people in our group asked for cheesecake and when it came they were quite disappointed as the size was barely a sliver, the crust was very hard and not very good.  The chocolate cake was great, as was the Tiramisu.  The waiter got items on the two checks mixed up, had to go and re-figure them.  All in all, a very disappointing experience.  Want the old Macaroni Grill back!"}
{"text":"Came here at 1830 on a Friday night and about 96% of tables were taken so a friend and I got seated right away. Server came to us right away with waters before anything was asked. I liked it, because, who wouldn't want water? I ordered calamari with a biscotti hot toddy (coffee with Bailey's). Strange combo but no regrets! The biscotti toddy was so delicious that I ordered a second one. The calamari was good. I like my fried calamari lightly breaded with a good crisp and theirs is heavily breaded but it was really crispy so I can't complain. My main dish was the pollo caprese. I was trying to imagine how it will look like and when it came and had a taste I wasn't dissatisfied. It was good but the chicken was a bit on the salty side but I liked the grilled/charred taste it had. I liked the pasta. Just the right balance of pasta to sauce ratio to fulfill a good flavor. I would come back to try other dishes and suggest for others to give it a try."}
{"text":"Wow that was the best service I've ever had!!! !   And.... It couldn't have been a worse experience.  Let me explain. 

Don was our server.   His service was impeccable!  We were celebrating my 12-year old granddaughter's birthday and he made her feel like she was the only patron in the restaurant.  He catered to her and topped off the evening with a happy birthday song Italian-operetta style.  The food was ordered and delivered in a timely and gracious manner.  It was hot and delicious.  

As we were leaving, I asked to speak to the manager - Larry - so I could convey my appreciation for Don and his job well done.  Larry was rude, and condescending, never bothering to stop wiping down his seating chart and look up at me as I spoke.  

When I mentioned that we had initially thought to go elsewhere because of the many negative Yelp reviews, he informed me that no one listens to Yelp anyway.  It's just a bunch of unhappy people posting stuff. Well, Larry, I wasn't unhappy until I talked to you. 

Go see Don.  Ignore Larry."}
{"text":"I always have a good experience at this particular location.  The host was friendly and prompt in sitting me.  The waiter seemed a little lost at times but I think he may have been new. But the food is always great and really good portion sizes. For a chain restaurant, I really like this place."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I stopped by for dinner. We noted that theres an open kitchen next to the front door. Also noted no gloves, no hair nets, dirty floor. 

Our server was Tony, and he was just not nice. He was rushing a lot and disappeared in the back for long periods of time. and he only had 2 small tables. I just think he didn't want to deal with customers at all that day, and it showed, he made us feel very unwelcome. He made the olive oil and vinegar on the table but forgot the bread, we waited 15 minutes to give him a chance and then finally asked another waiter to bring it. The food was mediocre at best, not worth the price. 

This is where those non existent hair nets could've come in handy: 
we discovered a hair in our tiramisu. We told Tony. The manager came over and dryly said, \"Sorry folks, we'll take it off the bill\". With no real concern or care in his voice that he had health hazards up the wazoo and how upset we were by it. We quickly got up and left and haven't looked back since."}
{"text":"I have frequented Macaroni Grill fairly often with my sister and my mother.  I usually enjoy it.  I walked to this restaurant from my hotel.  A dish that I have had several times was overcooked.  The penne rustica was clearly overcooked with little sauce.  The butternut squash dish also was over cooked and portions looked burnt.  I did not try to send it back because it was late and the restaurant was getting close to when it closed. 
when I pointed it out to the server at the end that i did not believe it was up to their standards, he thanked me for telling him and explained the pancetta is normally chewy.  I have had this dish several times and know what it should taste like and tried to explain it.   That was all said to me. Nothing else.
Very disappointed."}
{"text":"So, the reason for the 3 stars is our initial experience. We arrived and were greeted/seated by the manager in a very timely manner, but it was down hill after that. The server was definitely off his game. He came to the table, took our order and walked away. While he brought water, we had to ask the manager for the wine we ordered as well as bread. Then, the server came back and had to ask for our order again. We informed the manager, Ryan, of our issues and he was quick to correct the issue. The rest of the evening was smooth sailing and I really enjoyed the Blackened Chicken Parm. If you like spicy, this is definitely the way to go. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Food is decent and the wait is much, much better than Olive Garden on a Friday night. Service was OK. If it is authentic Italian that you're wanting, you're not getting it here or the Olive Garden..."}
{"text":"I thought that after my sister and daughter went bridesmaid dress shopping we would try the macaroni grill on for a quick lunch. We had never been to one before and thought it was just a macaroni place....cheap and quick. Boy we're we wrong in all the right ways!  When we walked in we saw a very fine restaurant atmosphere with more than pleasant staff. We ordered two appetizers - bruschetta croustini and zucchini fritis and the head chef offered us his favorite on the house:  goat cheese pappadew peppers.  They were all phenomenal, especially the pappadews!  I ordered the chicken maricella and my sis ordered chicken cannoli while my daughter ordered chicken and macaroni. Everything was unbelievably delicious. It was so good we had to order dessert. I got chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and sis got a lemon passion...once again amazing!   Dessert demanded espresso...wow!  No matter what got put on our table, we were wowwed beyond belief!  If I could give 10 stars I would!"}
{"text":"The Fettuccine Alfredo was under cooked and dry , when I told the waiter he informed the manager and was told it would be taken care of. I then waited another  20 minutes until the rest of the group I was dining with and was told I wouldn't be charged for the dish. How exactly is that taking care of the problem?  Did I go out to watch other people eat? Oh no that's right i went out to eat! Never going here again, I just feel sorry for anyone who makes the mistake of eating here or not eating here in my personal case."}
{"text":"Not the best pasta in the area, but for a quick or even full sit-down lunch, I tend to come here often. They always deliver on the 7 minute express lunches and I personally believe the service is great. The food is always delicious in my opinion. Bottom-line, being close to work, if I crave pasta I will very likely go here and I have done so over and over."}
{"text":"First off, a mini #StoryTime: Our family was eating dinner one night last week here at Romano's Macaroni Grill (and the husband was unintentionally still in uniform [because it was right after a long, hard day at work]). At the end of our meal, the manager walks over and lets us know that several regulars chipped in and paid for our meal, and that our dessert was on the house - manager's treat. I was blindsided: this was, in all honesty, the first time I experienced this in my years of service. Safe to say it moved me to tears in the privacy of my car - this small reminder, as my faith in humanity was slowly starting to grow more jaded, that people still care and people still give. Thank you, kind strangers, and thank you, Macaroni Grill in Las Vegas, for your kindness and generosity. 

By the way, the meal was incredible. The Portobello Fries were absolutely savory, especially coupled with their dipping Aioli. My Chicken Fettucine Alfredo was extravagantly rich, flavorful, and filling. Even the bread they bring out complimentary had the perfect crunchy crust texture they describe in Disney's Ratatouille. The dessert, Lemon Passion Cake, was ridiculously good. There was a balance between the tart lemon curd, sweet citrus cake, and rich but bland fresh creme that just WORKED. it never came off as bland, too sweet, or too tart. It was truly the perfect medley and complementary combination!

Our server, Josh, also went above and beyond for us. I wanted to make sure his efforts were recognized. Despite being obviously busy, he made time for us and made sure we had what we needed, that we were satisfied with our food, our drinks never went empty, etc. I'm surprised by the low-starred reviews... I can't attest to their experiences, but something has clearly changed and I was beyond impressed and highly recommend Romano's Macaroni Grill!"}
{"text":"Typical Italian chain. Great fresh bread and friendly service. Kind of cheesy to have paper on table to protect the tablecloths. 
Food was hot and tasty, though I'm not a fan of giant chunks of garlic in pasta. 
My only real shock was the terrible beer selection. 9 beers and all of them are domestics. They have kiltlifter and Sam Adams seasonal. Not a semblance of a medium bodied beer. Sad for an italian place."}
{"text":"Wonderful pasta, served in a pleasant setting by an attentive wait staff.
Mushroom Ravioli awesome. Shrimp linguini deeeelicious.
Woefully weak beer menu with NO craft beers."}
{"text":"The bartender was my waiter. He was very professional, competent and personable. I enjoyed the food, ambience and service. I think management has overlooked team cooperation. There were some very competent waiters and some standing around watching. I had three waiters pass by me before I was helped."}
{"text":"Hubby and I go for their Pick 2 lunch entrees.  Carmela's chicken gets me every time - it's THAT good."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food here. It's relatively affordable for the quality. Good price performer."}
{"text":"We placed an online order for 2 apps, 2 entrees and 2 deserts. We had to wait in the restaurant an hour past the pick up time and then found when we got home that 3 of our items were wrong...that's half! Had to go back to get it straightened out.  It took over 2 hours to get $60 worth of cold food! Never, ever, ever, EVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Expensive! And portion and quality of food fall short! The service was ok and honestly $17 for a brick chicken that looked and resembled as if was under a brick way to long. Way overpriced for mediocre food. Wish could say was worth it and my daughter chicken fingers were not cooked inside."}
{"text":"This place doesn't quite work for lunch. I arrived at 12:50 for a quick bite and ordered the lunch trio since I assumed it would be the quickest item. 

It took 11 minutes for the small Caesar salad to make its way to my table and 20 minutes for my iced tea. 

After trying to get anyone's attention for 10 minutes, I had to go to the hostess stand to have someone check the status of my second dish. On my way, I met my waiter with the food. 

The couple next to me were complaining to each other about the wait and managed to hail a wait staff--though not their own.   From recent reviews I read, this seems to be a known issue. 

My waiter was very pleasant and was quite busy.  I assume the cause of the slow service is a lack of staff."}
{"text":"There was nothing wrong with the service. The food was just not great. We ordered 2 appetisers and 3 entrees. The appetisers were good. They were creative and flavorful. The entrees left a lot to be desired. Just didn't make the grade. The portions were enourmous...Food marginal at best. Will not be back. Would much rather go to Carraba's."}
{"text":"Nice quiet Wednesday evening to visit Macaroni Grill.  Was the first time I had been there in probably a decade, so my expectations were all over the place.

They still have the white paper table-tops and crayons, which is great, gotta love that.  No longer do they have the giant jugs of house wine and the \"honor system\" for self-service.  So while that's a bit of a change, they did try to upgrade their house wine to a Sangiovese-Chianti blend which is a bit more in line with what they're trying to accomplish here.

The stuffed mushrooms were pretty typical as was the calimari for appetizers.  The bibb and blue salad was solid and included some pancetta and crispy onions on top making the salad exceed the expectation of a bag of lettuce and some carrots.  

My salmon was overcooked, but seasoned nicely.  Honestly, I don't expect them to have mind-blowing salmon, and this was amicable.  I swapped the standard sun-dried tomato orzo for a mushroom risotto which was actually a little undercooked, but still tasty.  

The other folks at the table enjoyed their meals, and their experience, so overall was a good experience and actually exceeded the expectations.

Waiter, Clay did a good job, and was quite accommodating to even my 2-year old, kudos to him and the rest of the waitstaff which did a nice job."}
{"text":"I went here the other night and it was a fairly not awesome experience. We got there early, and there were only a few people working there. This resulted in us waiting quite a bit to be seated and to get service. We both got the make your own pasta and I got a side caesar salad. I had to wait with my salad for a long time because I didn't have a fork....pretty weird. I felt like I was in coming to America or something. The food was completely bland. I had a mix of arrabiata sauce and garlic...two strong flavors....yet it had no flavor. I just wish I remembered how much this place is not good before I decide to go there again."}
{"text":"I went here for Mother's day with a big group of family. The dinner was a disaster. My uncle made the reservation for the wrong number of people, so I felt bad for the waitress, but it didn't excuse the poor service and food that we had. We were seated in the middle of the packed restaurant and the waitress came around and took everyone's orders. I ordered the build your own pasta with a caesar salad. The salad had barely any dressing on it, and was quite bland. Then our party waited about an hour and fifteen minutes for our dinners. In addition, we were not given any bread after the initial 3 loaves for 18 people nor water for about 20 minutes until we flagged someone down to get some. When the food came out, there were many mistakes. I do not know how they can mess up the build your own pasta because the customer fills out a paper form and checks the ingredients that are wanted.... well they did. My cousin got the same thing and ordered meatballs and meat sauce, and was brought out marinara with mushrooms.... hmmm. I ordered chicken, garlic, broccoli, spinach, and marinara. Well, it had no spinach and 2 cloves of garlic. The chicken was all fat, like it was what you cut away from a chicken breast before cooking it. It was some of the grossest chicken I have tasted. My brother ordered a dish that was supposed to have shrimp and some other meat in it...it came out in the smallest bowl I have ever seen and contained 1 shrimp. Really? Wow. All of the food was bland and of poor quality. I noticed their prices have gone down, but obviously it is at the sake of the quality."}
{"text":"Lobster ravioli is awesome. I recommend it over and over! Classy place right by the holiday inn."}
{"text":"Stepping out of the car, into the deserted parking lot, I was immediately knocked in the face with the most noxious fumes ever and doubled over while shouting \"OMG, what is that?!\" My sister said it smelled like a bathroom was backed up. I should have gotten right back in the car and left - it was too telling of things to come. 

It was 2 o'clock (6/21/11.) The place was a ghost town. We weren't entirely sure it was even open when we pulled up. I had already driven all over town with my sister looking for places to eat. After coming up short, we were going to Macaroni Grill, on principle. After braving the rank smell out in the parking lot, we went inside. There were a total of three tables with people at them. After standing around for a good couple of minutes, our soon-to-be waiter (D. name protected) seated us and handed me a ripped up menu.

Man, I hate it when I wear a dress and there are crumbs all over the booth seat because they scratch the back of my legs. The seat was covered in the sharpest, diamond-cutting crumbs - and the server didn't remove the extra place settings. 

Speaking of crumbs, another waiter brought out our waters and bread, or \"prison food\" as he called it. Prison food was right! We were brought out what looked like a loaf of bread, but was actually a gigantic crouton. Yeah, for those who don't cook - don't heat up bread, especially at a restaurant, in a microwave. It turns it damn near rock solid. This bread had clearly been microwaved. Trying to break the bread required us each to look in the other direction, you know like you have to do when pulling the little confetti fireworks, so you don't pull out an eye. We had to do that with the bread lest we get a scratched cornea with a shard of bread.

I ordered the porcini mushroom ravioli and my sister ordered the Pizza Margherita. Both looked great when they came out. Look, I love mushrooms - mushrooms, onion and garlic is akin to my personal \"mirepoix.\" This, this... \"dish,\" was awful! Never in my life had I needed to force myself to eat anything with mushrooms in it until today. The sauce was the consistency of milk.  Just awful. The pizza my sister ordered was so thin and floppy, all the toppings slid right off. Never mind that it was completely void of any flavor, both meals were barely palatable.

After sitting for nearly 20 minutes with half full plates of food, the waiter FINALLY told my sister he'd get boxes. Another 10 minutes later, he arrived with the box and the check. It took another 10 minutes for him to pick up the check. 

Good gawd, everything was awful. Never again!"}
{"text":"Food sucks!!!  Never again.  I spent $50 on horrible italian food.  

Spaghetti and meatballs with Bolognese sauce was the saltiest pasta dish I have ever eaten anywhere.  Mushroom ravioli was nothing special.  The margherita pizza was not authentic.  The crust was too hard and ordinary.  It should be a bit more chewy.  The tiramisu was partly frozen on the inside.  I didn't dine out to eat something I can get from a frozen food section of the supermarket.  Presentation was bad.  Don't they have a sharp enough knife to cut the dessert more straight?

Worst restaurant I've been to in a long time."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday afternoon, it wasn't super busy and we were seated right away. We put in for two appetizers and a bottle of the house wine. We enjoyed the wine while we waited for the appetizers, after about 15-20 the waitress comes back over and realizes we still have yet to receive any food. The manager then comes over, apologizes, believes he recognizes us, which was a mistake on his part. He then proceeded to take our dinner order, serve the salads even before the appetizers arrive. So now we finally get the appetizers, and the dinner comes out approx 5-10 minutes afterward. Couldn't really enjoy either at the point as we felt rushed to enjoy the hot food, before the other goes cold. I did order a dessert, lemon cake to go, and never really saw the manager or waitress afterwards.  Not to happy and no immediate plans on going back anytime soon, although we enjoy the wine."}
{"text":"I like this location the best. The last two times I came here (which were over a year ago), I had pretty good food. I went to ANOTHER Macaroni Grill and it was a \"meh\" experience. I was actually...really surprised because other then the decor, there was not much consistency between the two. So basically you're reading this and saying, \"Is it worth going?\". It's overpriced...Just sayin'.  If you do go, get pizza. Best bang for your buck really. Oh and if your food is bland, just keep eating the appetizer bread they have already for you :) That I did love."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon lunch here at 1:00, seemed to be few customers. Son selected this restaurant. We have been here before. Lots of other choices at Desert Ridge.  Did not have high expectations, but food was good as was the service. Four in our party. 

Selections were unlimited soup and salad, build your own pasta, alfredo fettuccine, and a chicken florentine salad. Cheese cake or lemon sorbet for desert. All happy campers...lunch menu was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I am only giving an extra star to bump this up to a 3 star review because it was Christmas Eve and I want to give them the benefit of the doubt.

We did not have a great experience here, but our server was friendly and apologetic, so I will hope it was a one time thing.

We were there at about 8:30 on Christmas Eve, and it was surprisingly busy.  We were sat immediately and approached by our server.  I ordered the house wine - their \"honor\" system is pretty funny.  I wonder how often people cheat on how many glasses they've had?  Although I am not too sure about having an open bottle of wine, that has been on who knows how many other tables.  I guess I don't trust that weirdos don't put something in the bottle.

My Mom ordered the filet with lobster mashed potatoes.  The meat came out perfectly medium rare, and the asparagus was amazing.  However, the mashed potatoes were extremely dry.  They could've used some cream or something added to them to make them edible.

I ordered the chicken scallopine.  If it weren't for the salad we ordered to share beforehand, I would still probably be hungry.  We waited, and waited and waited for our food.  Our server came and apologized and said it would be out in just a minute.  Then he brought my Mom's food and said that my food would be right out - that they ran out of angel hair pasta. (?) So he decided that I would get fettucini instead.  I am not sure why this decision delayed my meal, but I smiled and continued to wait.  And wait.  My Mom was almost done with her meal when our server brought me some mac 'n cheese bites and apologized again, saying that these were a free snack since my food was taking so long.  He then said that the kitchen had tried to send out a meal with a small piece of chicken, so he sent it back.  Um, okayyyy - but I am hungry and I don't want these mac 'n cheese bites!  Just bring me my damn food (I get grumpy when I am hungry).  It probably took another 15 minutes, and finally my food was brought out.  It didn't even taste like what was described on the menu, or any other chicken scallopine I've had - but there were 2 large chicken breasts, which I was told was extra, because of the wait.  Whatever.

Our server was friendly, although he disappeared for a LONG time while we were eating, and smelled like cigarettes when he got back.  Considering there was an obvious issue with our meal, he didn't even check back.  We were sitting there waiting for a box and the check.  We didn't get out of there until almost 10p -it shouldn't take 2 people that long to dine at Macaroni Grill.  C'mon man!

I've been here before and never had an issue, so I am hoping it was a 1 time thing.  I don't know when I will be back, but it's possible I will give them another try."}
{"text":"Was here over the holidays and had a remarkable time with the family.  Service was incredibly attentive.  I was especially pleased with the house wine brought to. The table, affordable and very delicious.  As a table we sampled appetizers and there were several I'd try again.  Peppers with goat cheese and artichoke potato cakes."}
{"text":"The manager is awesome.   She greets us warmly and personally every time we come in (about every 4-6 weeks).  Actually remembers us!  Food is consistent.   Prices reasonable.  Great family restaurant."}
{"text":"Yawn.  After an unsuccessful attempt to hit Mardenely's in Mesa tonight - it's out of business - we wound up at Mac Grill.  I knew what we were getting into as I've been in a few of these joints in the past.  I had a salad and bowtie pasta in meat sauce with sausage.  The pricing is tame, but the salad isn't included, so by the time you get to the bottom line, the pricing isn't so hot - especially for the quality of the food.  The salad was fine, but the pasta was a weaksauce effort.  The sauce had NO flavor, right in league from what I'd expect from Stauffer's.  It was thick with ground meat, but it too was completely without flavor and was rubbery to boot.  I almost thought my sausage had been left out, but closer inspection showed it was there along with the ground beef, and had so little flavor that I couldn't distinguish it from the ground beef.  I'd give the food a 2.5 star review, and I'll round to 3 only because the server was pleasant and attentive.  If you can't even ace a bowl of bowtie pasta, something is seriously wrong.  Time to find another local option for Italian."}
{"text":"This is one of our favs! We always come for a birthday celebration or just because. The wait staff is always nice. Tonight we had a new arugula entree salad and chicken scalopini from the 'date night' menu. Our wine and beer was included as well as dessert! All very good as usual."}
{"text":"Anna is the heart & soul of Mac  if I don't see her beautiful smiling face when I walk in the door, my visit is not the same. She always takes amazing care of me & my high maintenance requests. I especially love the way she made me a specialized drink. Love love love Anna, ask for her!! Mustard"}
{"text":"Went here for Mothers Day I have been many times with my family. Macaroni grill isn't anything special just an Italian chain restaurant. They were pretty busy we had 8 people in our party they gave us one loaf of their bread to start because the kitchen was so backed up they also couldn't find the balsamic vinegar to add to the olive oil for the bread. After about 25 minutes they finally found it, the bread is always good and fresh though. 

I got Carmela's chicken for my entree. It was rigatoni with chicken and mushrooms in a Marsala cream sauce which was pretty good for a chain restaurant. My uncle makes the absolute best Marsala and have never had one that comes close. I still do love chicken Marsala even if my uncle doesn't make it. 

My advice is if you are expecting some incredible Italian good look somewhere else. This is a big chain restaurant though it isn't terrible it's pretty basic."}
{"text":"Macaroni Grill is yrying so hard to get it right. The spaghetti snd meatballs was truly delicious as was the chicken on a brick and the fish. Gena, the manager snd David our server snswere all our questions snd were bery attentive. The food was a little slow but mor time for our party to converse. Thanks MG. We'll bw back."}
{"text":"During the hot summer months in Phoenix we can't wait for the weather to change and for a cool breeze and light rain to make it all better. But change is not something we necessarily want in a good restaurant. Our last visit to the Grill was definitely a change but it was more like the temperature got hotter and it simply made it more miserable. 

The service was less than perfect as we celebrated my daughters 14th birthday. We had to ask for water repeatedly partially because they only left small cups for us to use after removing the tall glasses from the table. The food was average which included my Sausage Pasta dish. It reminded me of pasta with chopped up sausage placed in it without it really being cooked together. 

Overall we like Macaroni Grill but the changes to small water glasses and average food make us cautious. We had to ask for crayons which is a fun part of the experience we have come to expect. I finally went to the front desk to get them. The server did not write her name on the table as usual and didn't even tell us who she was. \"Hey you \" just doesn't feel right in a restaurant that usually shines with excellence. We will be back but I'm not sure how soon."}
{"text":"Literally just walked out. Sat at our table for 15 minutes unable to get any eye contact from any server. My husband had to get up and try to politely ask a server if we could get someone to help us. To which he had to ask \"ma'am?\" Three times before he was responded to
With an exasperated \"yeah?!\" Without even so much as looking up. He then said \"I guess we will just go somewhere else...\" and got no reply, no eye contact nothing. Got up and walked out. Will NEVER return. Absolutely worst restaurant experience. Management should be ashamed of their systems and employment choices."}
{"text":"Showed up with a big group (13) to be split with 2 checks and some allergy alerts.   The restaurant was super accommodating, rearranged things to get us seated, handled all our special requests and did a great job.  Food and service were both good.   We don't have macaroni grill in our home city anymore so when we are in Cleveland we make a point to hit this restaurant because of the good experience we have had with food and service."}
{"text":"One of the worst dinners out since I can remember.  Next time I think about eating at Macaroni grill I am going to reconsider.  Thinking about this visit, over cooked, over expensive and very poor service.  I will just open up a box of kraft macaroni next time, I will enjoy it more.  Burnt Childrens pizza, missed salads, and simple requests not fullfilled."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner for the first time on Sunday night.  It was about 5:30 PM and the place was nearly empty.  Just two tables occupied.  Of course it was raining cats and dogs which surely kept many at home.  But what was odd is that the entire staff was running around organizing everything for the dinner service as if they had just arrived even though they open at 11:00 AM on Sundays.  Again, kind of odd.  

But regardless, I was seated and served promptly, the beers were ice cold and refreshing, and the food came out fresh and as ordered.  

I ordered the Lasagna and a Caesar salad.  Accompanied by a tasty loaf of bread with olive oil, it was very good.  Really hit the spot on a dreary, rainy day.  I would not anything was special.  Just very good. I'm sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Last night, Macaroni Grill saved our Valentine's Day. After a not so great experience with Brio Tuscan Grill because they overbooked to ensure their tables were filled, we called frantically trying to find somewhere to have a nice dinner as we both work full time and thought we deserved it.
I called, in tears because of the Brio fiasco, asking if it was busy to see if we could eat there. The host Andrew was very sympathetic to our situation and ensured us a table in 5 min or less.
When we got there we were greeted with smiling faces and sympathetic faces and they reassured us Valentine's Day wasn't completely ruined.
We were seated within 30 seconds of waiting, and our server, Guy, was funny, upbeat and knew everything on the menu. The food was amazing, hot, and I couldn't help be be so overjoyed by the amazing service.
Thank you all very much for all you did. You saved the night for us.
A big thank you to Andrew and Guy as well! We will be returning soon:)"}
{"text":"The bar area was freezing; bring a jacket even though it's 90 degrees outside!"}
{"text":"Went to Macaroni Grill for one of my employee's birthday. The food was excellent, which is why I am giving 2 stars, but the service left a LOT to be desired. Honestly, based on the bad service I received today I definitely won't be back to this location. The fact that the parking lot only had 1 car in the lot at 1115 should have tipped me off that something was off, but we went anyway. We were seated quickly and then the server came over. She asked about our drink order and left. Never once sharing her name with us. (Only on my receipt did I learn her name was Shelly). It took her a good while to take our order, she seemed more interested in getting the app out for 1 of the 5 instead of taking the rest of our order. The food came out in a decent amount of time (no real complaints there especially since the food was great.) But when one of my companions asked about something that was missing from her dish, the server basically told her \"no you are wrong\" and forced that person to pull up an electronic menu (never once did the server offer to grab a menu for her) and proved the server wrong. To which she said \"well did you want it still?\" Obviously she wanted it or she would not have asked. That level of unaccommodating and almost rude behavior is unacceptable for a server. Then to top it off she filled only 2 people's glasses of the five at the table and left the others empty. I would have really liked some more water. When I asked for a to go box she seemed almost annoyed. Then we had to wait a good 20 minutes for her to cash out our checks. I kept an eye on her and watched her wait on other tables instead of cashing us out. I think she realized she probably wouldn't get a generous tip so the one person that paid in cash she had big bills too, when she tried to ask for change (she was planning to leave more) the waitress ignored her and kept walking on. Definitely the servers loss on that. So bottom line - the food is great, but the service was HORRIBLE and it took forever."}
{"text":"Had dinner delivered through door dash, delivery was fine. Food was so so. Ordered the fried mozzarella which was ok and Mom's Rocotta Meatballs spaghetti. Ok at best, not much flavor and the spaghetti was dry.  I might try them again but a different entree. Would have appreciated some bread and/or grated cheese. Don't go out if your way."}
{"text":"We went there for our anniversary dinner. That was the first time we were trying this restaurant and we were thrilled with the service and quality of the food. Authentic Italian dishes and cater for vegetarians. We loved it. Service was very fast despite them being very busy.  Everything was spot on. Highly recommended.."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for my birthday dinner. 3 of us ordered the blackened chicken with capellini, and one the Mamas trio. Pasta was completely dry with chunks of spinach or whatever it was. Chicken was the chewier than a starburst and tasted like microwave chicken. Not even sure if it was cooked all the way. The waiter noticed we hadn't eaten our chicken and when we said it was really chewy that we didn't like it he didn't even offer to take it off. 81 dollars wasted. The waiter was nice, but I feel like he should have offered to give us some discount."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant. The food has always been good. We love the bread."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Macaroni Grill in at least 5 years.  We ended up there during a long weekend golf trip and we were staying at the nearby Courtyard.  Out of fatigue we picked it as it was close.  Great choice by us, we were pretty impressed!  Mike was our server, and he was spot on with the Diet Coke refills.  Food was good too.  I never thought I'd say try it, but I am indeed saying that."}
{"text":"Walked in @ 8:30 to a completely empty house and not a greeter in sight. Stood for 5 mins or so contemplating leaving and when someone finally said \"Hi\" he told us to seat ourselves ($20 bucks a plate and I gotta seat myself? OOOOok). Booth WAS SO DIRTY. SO much food in the seat it was absolutely the craziest thing! I was so hungry I didn't care and sat down and quickly ordered drinks. The server took at least another 5 mins being weird and long winded and was gone another 10 mins when he came back with drinks but no bread. Only recommendations were the MOST EXPENSIVE items (surprise, surprise). Ordered and GOD DAMN the up-sell is strong with this place!!! Would you like to add this? Would you like to add that... So is that the $12 salad or the $3.50 salad you HAVE to pay for because the entrees don't come with one... ANNOYING... FINALLY got salads after being there for 30 mins already and guess what?? STILL no bread... actually ate mt entire salad and had just gotten up to go find some f&*%&^ing bread on my own when it showed up AT LAST! Food was really good but my lasagna was pretty cold in the middle. The portion was so big it didn't really matter as I couldn't eat it all anyway. Drinks sat empty (in an empty restaurant??). All and all, this place has fine dining prices and food, but with McDonald's service standards. NOT fun!"}
{"text":"After reading other reviews I was a little skeptical of coming here. Don't let the other reviews discourage you! I had a wonderful time here for dinner with my family. Our waitress Hilary, was incredible! The sweetest soul! The food was amazing, and it was very fresh and steaming hot. We had described something off of an old menu, and they had no problem preparing it for us!"}
{"text":"I went here with my sister on 1/14/13.  I'd never been before this trip.  

They were short-handed, so the bartender was seating people.  It took a few minutes.  Whatever.  No sweat.  I wasn't in a hurry.

I had the lobster ravioli.  Very good..
My sister had the salmon, which was delicious!
My nephew had lasagna - very good.
We also got Italian nachos - Okay, but nothing earth-shattering.

Over all I really enjoyed the dinner.   The service was good, despite their being short-handed.    Dessert was good too!"}
{"text":"We always go to the one on lakemead and rainbow will never come to this location. Food was very bland and it had hair! Gross... not only on my food, my husbands and sons food as well. Don't come here..."}
{"text":"Well...have been going there for years but haven't been there for a couple of years. We arrived at 7:15 on a Sunday evening expecting a wait as in the past. The place was barely half full. We sat down and received a loaf of bread as in the past but no knife to cut it. I looked around and nobody had a knife. I was able to cut it with my butter knife. They offer an option to create your own pasta dish but you have to ask for the pad. Luckily they leave you crayons to fill out your request. My wife and sister had a calamari appetizer and said it was good. However my entree was no more than ok. I had penne pasta and a lot of the tubes were stuck together like they had been cooked much earlier. My wife ordered eggplant Parmesan and said it was over cooked. 
I really used to love this place and while it is not horrible it is no more than ok. The service is good but if I'm going to eat chain Italian I'll be going to their competition. I can get endless salad instead of being dinked 3 to 4.50 more for a salad. Oh the other place gives you mint chocolates with your bill. A small thing but little things add up."}
{"text":"Our server Ashli was exceptional, she kept up conversation without being awkward or invasive, and we felt like we really got to know her. 

The food was great, we tried some of their new dishes. I had the chicken parmeggiano and a friend has a shrimp dish with gelato to share. The restrooms were clean and the atmosphere was nice, even though the place was a little empty.

All in all the food and service were good enough to carry the meal over even if it wasn't the most popular place to be."}
{"text":"I dont know what's up with the negative reviews.  We frequent this place and have always had great food and great service.  Only twice out of a dozen or more visits have they made a mistake with our order.  Both times they went above and beyond to rectify the situation.  Once offering us free deserts and once comping both entrees!  Its really hard to find restaraunts that still treat customers this way."}
{"text":"I was rather disappointed in this location, now they have limited ones here in town and have only been to this one, but this makes me question even going to the other locations. First when we got there we stood around for a good 5 minutes or so when people (workers) were walking around looking at us, never once said \"welcome, we will be right with you\" nope just got looks like \"oh great more people\" Then the hostess was \"busy\" cleaning off the tables and seemed to not notice us. Then she was like \"oh your here\" then sat us down didn't say anything once she sat us down, then no utensils napkins nothing. I dont know if it was close to their closing time who knows but she didn't seem happy at all. Then once we got our waiter she took our drink order, which took like 10-15 minutes which we only ordered soda and tea. Keep in mind the place was not busy at all just seemed like no one wanted to wait on us. then after forever for our drinks, then he took our order, and we had to flag him down to take our order, then what seemed like too an hour or more our food finally came. The food was good its just the service was not the greatest, no where i used to live they closed these locations and i was glad to see them out here in Vegas, but now after this issue, I dont think I will be going back. No one ever apologized for anything so I guess this is how they operate here. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"For a chain, I really love the Macaroni Grill. The bread that comes is phenemonal and the service is usually very good.  I almost always get the Chicken Scaloppine because it's my favorite and it's easy to split. I really enjoy that when you say you are splitting they bring it out on 2 plates already, it just makes life a little bit easier.  I like the 2 for $9 tapas too, the mac and cheese bites are delicious! The Chocolate Cake is also delicious!"}
{"text":"I've heard numerous things about this place and today was the day I decided to try it. 

As soon as my friend and I walked into the door, we weren't even greeted. The waitress/host who did see us looked completely and utterly annoyed. No \"welcome to our restaurant\" greeting. It was more so, \"For two right? Come follow.\" This was already a bad first impression of this restaurant. 

As soon as we sat down, I completely enjoyed the crayons and paper table sheets provided at our table. Made the time go by much faster. Didn't realize until I looked up, that it has been ten minutes and no one has even taken our drink order. Our server finally came moments later looking very perplexed. He told us his name and offered us a free taste of the wine of the day. Probably the only good thing about this place. After he dropped off our drinks, we didn't see him again for another ten minutes. The manager who kept looking at our table saw the look in our faces and took our order. I told her it was my first time here and she recommended me the calamari as an appetizer. I asked her why and she told me it was the BEST. I trusted her with that. Needless to say, she was completely wrong. I ordered the pasta milano and my friend made his own pasta. 

The calamari is 10.50. PLEASE save your money. It's really not all that. There was no taste and it was barely battered. The red sauce provided for it was cold. I never had to put salt and pepper on my calamari before until I came to this place. NEVER AGAIN. 

Our server finally came back to us and told us to fill out another sheet for the \"make your own pasta\" because he lost it. Keep in mind, we have been waiting for our food for almost 40 minutes at this point. So disappointing. 

When we FINALLY received our food, the disappoint again was real. 

My pasta milano consisted of roasted chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and garlic cream. There was barely any sauce and my pasta was still somewhat hard. My friends pasta was so much better though. Fettuccine Alfredo with bell peppers and shrimp. 

I will never come back to this place. As a first timer, the impression that I received from the employees were completely negative. This experience was completely negative. Just save your money and go somewhere else. It's already bad enough that I say Olive Garden is better than this place."}
{"text":"I came to this Tatum location for the first time on May 30, 2016, to meet a woman for possible traveling roommate prospect.  She suggested we meet here because it was half way.  

I ordered Rosemary Ribeye with rosemary butter $26 with grilled veggies , squashes, zuch, and seasoned potato wedges.  The grilled veggies were soooo sweet, I almost wondered if they soaked the veggies in sugar solution.  I was very specific on how I wanted my steak said red on the inside, and bleeding, but not so raw I couldn't chew it.  When he brought my order to the table, server Andrew told me he wanted to make sure it was cooked to my liking and to cut into the steak and tell him if I was happy with it.   When I saw the inside at the edge, even red and bloody, I was euphoric!  Other steaks are cooked more on the edges, but somehow, this steak was red on inside, and evenly cooked throughout the entire piece, rare.  Even rare, it still had the flame broiled charred flavor throughout, and charred markings.  I even ate the fat because the charred parts of the fat were so delicious!  This is one of the best steaks I had in my life, I told my dining companion.   I cannot remember better!  She said she would order that next time.  She had Caesar salad for about $10.  The bread was good too, tho I normally don't eat bread cos I have diabetes.  

Our server Andrew was so impeccably mannered and gracious.  !  I asked for extra rosemary butter, if there is no charge, and Andrew brought it.   He filled our water glasses and there is nothing I could say about his service or manner that was lacking.  I rarely give five stars.  10 stars for Andrew and for my entree!"}
{"text":"We Ate here for a celebration and expected so much more. We ordered a chicken Parmesan and a macaroni with chicken. The macaroni was mediocre and the chicken was burnt to a crisp. It ruined the meal sadly. I do not think we will be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Not impressed. Probably won't be back. Service could have been better. Somewhat slow."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a friend.  Hadn't been here in 10 years.  Our server brought a crusty warm bread loaf to dip in the olive oil.  The olive oil tasted old; (it was the bottom of the bottle.)  
  I ordered the chicken sandwich/pasta fagioli lunch combo.  The soup was watery.  Pasta Fagioli is usually similar to chili with pasta; this was not.  I did like the little pasta discs.  The chicken sandwich was just a chicken sandwich.  Nothing special.  My friend had the spaghetti bolognese.  She said the sauce was not that good.  It was sparse on her spaghetti.
It will probably be another 10 years before I return.  It was just okay."}
{"text":"We have been to Macoroni Grill many times in the past but we were craving some good Italian food and thought we would go here.
I am just hooked on Eggplant especially since I cut meat out of my diet, all but my sushi .
So we were seated with a waitress Julie. She was excellent from the moment we sat till we left. She was on top of everything. Very accommodating. One of the best waitresses we have had in awhile.
The food was very good tonight with the special requests that I wanted angel hair pasta and I changed the sauce to Vodka. No extra charges like some places would do.
My husband had Angel Hair pasta with Vodka sauce a bit spicy.
The food came out hot and perfect. 
No problems at all.
We highly enjoyed our dinner here and would for sure go back as well as our waitress being good that helped a lot!!
Make sure if you go in to ask for her."}
{"text":"What happened to Macaroni Grill? It seems like by adding these Express Lunch and Dinner deals that they are devaluing their food. I came here for lunch, but was immediately enticed by the specials. However, my waiter pre-warned me that since I was sitting at the table, the time guarantee of 7 minutes would not apply to my meal. I completely understood. I suppose that many people complain that they don't get their food on time. The guarantee is only applicable if you ordered it at the counter.

I actually opted for the $10 three course lunch special. I would not call it three traditional courses though. The Mozzarella Frita was a bite sized portion of parmesan breaded with mozzarella and arrabbiata sauce. Instead of the caesar salad, I opted for their green salad. It wasn't really that great. You don't get a choice of salad dressing as it is dressed with undesirable vinaigrette sauce. Finally, the Penne Arrabbiata was plain in that all you could taste was the sauce and the pasta. It was doused with fresh mozzarella, imported romano, basil, and lots of arrabbiata sauce. The dish could have been better with some additional toppings. 

I used to love coming to this chain, but it seems like the sophistication of this place is gone."}
{"text":"Very good service!!  The food and wine were good as well. Our server Lamad was very friendly and personable.  Overall a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice, has a very pleasant theme and nice kitchen. The food is average Italian style meals, portion size is great and their bread is fresh and hot. The Beer selection is poor when it comes to craft Beer. They do offer a few Great Lakes Beers along with the Seasonal Sam Adams. If you do not ask for a wine glass they will give you a normal style glassware for the house wine so make sure you specifically ask for the proper glassware I find that kind of tacky. All in all it's a nice night out with pretty decent food a step up from Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Nia was our sever for lunch today. Went out of her way to make everything very nice!!!
Thank you, Nia"}
{"text":"Never had a problem with this place until tonight, my husband and I went in and ordered our usual bow tie pasta with cheese sauce. Our waiter, Jose, was obviously annoyed with us that we didn't want appetizers by his tone and the look on his face. He then proceeded to question my order like he's never heard of it before but in a very rude way. He didn't offer us any wine when we sat down or grated cheese with our meal. The manager wound up bringing our food out and refilling our drinks for us. Jose didn't have but 3 tables of which we were one, and he was laughing and talking with the table next to us so he wasn't having a bad day, he just seemed to be really annoyed by having to be our server? My husband thinks it may be because his other 2 tables were older people who looked like they ordered a full course meal. My husband and I are in our twenties so maybe he just thought of us as kids, at least that is very much how he treated us. I was a server for 4 years and I would have never thought to treat a customer that way, my husband almost said something to the manager but I didn't want to get the server into trouble since its Christmas tomorrow. Regardless we were so disappointed and just felt very snubbed. If we do return, which won't be likely, we will certainly request someone other than Jose."}
{"text":"So we ordered from the office for about 4 people curbside service. Lots of food and stuff-hence the, bring it to my car window so I don't have to get out and try to carry all this shit! When I got there the was a car taking up both curbside parking spaces and there was no one in the car. So I called the restaurant to let them know there was nowhere for me park. The hostess literally sighed on the phone and said \"I guess I can. We don't normally do that.\" I was like I am literally outside but the take away parking is occupied and there is no one even in the car! She's says, \"Well don't you just want to come in then?\" I'm not going to even finish with the food that was ok at best because her attitude pretty much sealed it for me."}
{"text":"This was by far the worse MG I have dined. All 5 entrees (big family) ordered were served cold. Not warm, not luke warm, COLD! After being re-heated undoubtedly in a microwave we discovered that each guess was discussing who had the more bland tasting dish. We have always enjoyed MG and it was a complete shock to have this type of experience. We will not return.  There were 2 exceptions to this tastless cold meal....the house salad dressing and the bread."}
{"text":"What the hell happened here? The food used to be great. Everything from the appetizers to the salad to the entrees were bland and uneventful. The only saving grace was the service from the bartender James"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been here and I was really looking forward to the create a pasta since it's been awhile.  Apparently they don't have it anymore.  The quality wasn't what I expected. The service was alright,  just not sure if I would return again."}
{"text":"I spoke too soon. I had lobster ravioli in Ventura, CA location and it was heavenly but not from this location. I was looking forward to the repeat of my last experience but as it turned out, the pasta wasn't tender, lobster was dry, they forgot to include my utensils.
When I walked in, I had to wait to get someone to acknowledge me for a few minutes even thought here were many employees there. Then once I told them I wanted a takeout they told me \"you'll have to order at the bar or if you can get someone, you can order from the kitchen\". I paced between kitchen & the bar for few more minutes before I finally got someone in the kitchen only to be told \"you need to order from the bar\". (Aren't you in front of an active computer??) 
Oh and I was with my 13 mo old too. Really? I just want my food & go back to my hotel!!
Not only my lobster ravioli was a $18 waste of money, my baby's \"mac& cheese\" was just a bowl of penne with thin cheese sauce poured over them. I paid for that fraud???  Once I got to order, the bartender girl was trying to work me hard with chit chatting for a tip. Whatever...
I've been taken..."}
{"text":"I ordered my food over the phone, it was ready in 15mins just like they said. The food is great, and the serivce is excellent."}
{"text":"Got together with a few former coworkers Saturday night early (5:00-ish) to catch up & have an early Christmas celebration.  Since it just so happened none of us had been to MG in a while, we decided this would be our spot (we used to go regularly as a group when we still worked together at a nearby office).  Things have changed.

ATMOSPHERE:
They still have this going for them.  This is one of the main reasons we used to gather here to begin with.  Still a great place to just kick back in a booth, relax with friends or loved ones, and not worry about having to be too quiet or having to talk over deafening music and patrons.  Noise level is just right, which is greatly appreciated.  Few places are able to balance debauchery and civility so well.

SERVICE:
We had a great waitress. She was really on-point, even as the crowds increased, being neither too obtrusive nor inattentive.  One thing I really appreciated was that she attempted to quickly \"get to know us\" a bit--this helped her help a few of US make decisions when too many things looked yummy or weren't in the mood for anything specific.   Friendly. Prompt. Attentive. Knowledgeable. What more could you ask for?!

FOOD:
NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE.  Don't get me wrong, it's still palatable; HOWEVER, you can tell the quality has diminished drastically.  I ordered the Mediterranean Olives ($2) in citrus marinade as an appetizer. Must say I really enjoyed those (sodium warning...whew!).  Another ordered the fried calamari appetizer ($9).  This was a disappointment.  While the price was average/reasonable, one expects more than just a few bland, nearly tasteless rings of the stuff.  It was mostly the tentacle ends of the poor lil' squid.  And lots of them.  Odd.  Her lobster ravioli ($18) was yummy according to her (looks a tad skimpy, but said it was quite filling).   My Pasta Milano ($12) was nothing like it used to be.  It's now made with rigatoni instead of bow-tie. In-and-of-itself, that's no big deal, but if you're a 'pasta person' you know how specific types of pasta can make a dish (along with the texture).  Another of us ordered the Chicken Parm ($13).  Nothing special there. Hafta say it kind of looked like something you could prepare at home & was told it tasted pretty much the same.

All-in-all I have to say they seem to have \"gone cheap\" on their food, ingredients, and preparation.  They seem to have soured along with the economy.  I hate to say it, but MG (at least this location) is pretty much off my radar now.  Their close proximity doesn't win out over quality."}
{"text":"The bread and olive oil were mediocre, price was about $10-$15 for meh food. Olive Garden and Buca Di Beppo were both better buys.

In terms of specifics - 
Service was ok, nothing great. The olive oil was not particularly tasty. Our bread was ok ... not stale, but not even warm either. Girlfriend got the tenderloin skewers ($15) and they were not cooked medium. The accompanying vegetables were burnt. We should have sent it back, I was just a wimp. I'd say I would be more assertive next time but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Long wait for food about an hour. portions were small. Waiter was awesome. not the macaroni grill I remember from years ago. it needs to bring back bigger portions and and speed up the chefs, the place was empty and we had to wait an hour for our food.
our waiter was the best i have ever seen, fast friendly and nice"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we will not be dining here again ever! We had a large group and server was not attentive to food quality! First there was hair in our water, second there was hair in our spaghetti and when they took it back, they just replated the food and we found the same hair in the spaghetti.... talk about gross! Yes needless to say, our large party walked out! The manager on duty said she couldn't do anything for us. Not good customer service and not good food, unfortunately!!!"}
{"text":"I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.

However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)

So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.

When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.

The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.

As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.

A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.

The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.  I do not intend to go back."}
{"text":"You're kidding me right Romano? $3.79 for this rationed portion? What are you spreading one stalk to 5 portions????

Seriously, you're kidding right? 

It's like a month early for April fool's day!!!

Give me my money back, you can have your measly scrawny portion back."}
{"text":"We came out on a rare date night and didn't want a burger joint. I haven't been to a Macaroni Grill in a long time. Menus change, but I didn't see anything exciting on it tonight. I had ice tea, he had a Grapefruut Sculpin.  It was almost 8pm when we came in and despite the many empty tables, they sat a family wiith littles to my back. So, I got to enjoy a little guy smacking his pizza in my ear, because he was turning around in the booth the whole time. (I love kids....its just that they could have sat them at one of the other hundred tables)
He ordered spaghetti and ricotta meatballs with bolognese. It was dry, unfortunately.
The complimentary bread is nice and the calamari was good. I enjoyed the pesto and I think it was a truffle mayo.
I ordered a steak and greens salad. It was so salty! Just a clunky plate all around.....blue, briny cheese, crisped prosciutto, salted steak, and likely salt in a very heavy dressing. The kale had long stems. And those horrid onion straws showed up on top. It just seems like a place like this that charges these menu prices could skip the bar food. My lips could not handle the salt. The manager was kind to take it off the check. 
I can feel my ankles swelling."}
{"text":"Our salads were totally wilted. When we told Pat our server she said she would tell the Manager she walked over and spoke to the Chef, Pat came back and said we were correct the lettuce was wilted and that they were going to throw it away. That was it no sorry nothing. I had the pork chop it was tough as a boot. Pat spent our whole visit on here phone so we had to flag her down for drink refills. We spent close to $100.00 for really lousy food."}
{"text":".                        T I R A M I S U 

Creamy, velvety, smooth, with a perfect balance of sweetness, espresso, rum, cocoa, mascarpone cheese, and crispy sugar-sprinkled lady-fingers.  Romano's version is the best Tiramisu we've EVER had.  Probably the finest DESSERT we've had from any restaurant or bakery.  They do it right, and it's consistently excellent.

We haven't eaten any soups, salads, or entree's here in maybe seven or eight years ---but not because we didn't find our visits acceptable.  It was always affordable, a good value, a welcoming atmosphere, and a cheerful staff.  And if something wasn't quite right (rarely), it was quickly rectified.  I just happen to prefer my own Italian cooking.  But for the occasional sweet tooth, we'll continue stopping in for their luscious Tiramisu.  There are several ingredient and preparation variations for this classic indulgence, but Romano's in North Olmsted is incomparable.  PERFECTO."}
{"text":"Slow prep time for food - nowhere near the time I was told it would be ready.  Seemed like hectic employees scurrying around with hardly any customers in sight.  Parking is generous for this location.  Food was nothing to complain about, but not clearly a notch above other chain Italian like Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best but our waiter David made our visit worth the trip.  Actually the entire wait staff was great. It was my daughters 20th birthday so we were having a small family lunch.  David was very pleasant, funny and proficient.  Everyone at our table was impressed with the staff.  I won't return as food quality vs. price isn't worth the trip.  But they are fortunate to have such nice people representing the chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Let's start with atmosphere. The restaurant has a great appearance and nice lighting. The staff are always friendly. The food is not the best Italian. It is far above it's closest competitor, but it is still a chain. We enjoy ourselves every time we go. Fresh baked bread not frozen bread sticks. Wine list is below what you would expect at an Italian restaurant. All in all we continue to dine here."}
{"text":"I took some great photos, yeah...but, it's overpriced and not unique.

Things I love: 
The look of the restaurant. Love those paper table clothes you can doodle on. 
The fact that they have an opera trained singer on staff. WOAH! Amazing

Things I wasn't too stoked about:
Just seemed like the Olive Garden with an extra 3 bucks on the top because there's a working fireplace in the joint.
Not blown away by the food (isn't that really what I came for?)

I mean, it's clever. It seems like a really cool Italian Rustica Kitchen, so you're paying for the ambiance. If you're okay with that, go...but know that you're not going to get anything above Olive Garden quality.

Sorry : ("}
{"text":"Service was great. Darin is the only reason they got a 2 instead of a 1.  We told him we needed to eat quick, and he did get us in and out quickly.  However, we ordered the prosciutto melt an it was horrible.  Absolutely no flavor and I swear there was no prosciutto, but in its place a few pieces of extra crunchy bacon bits.  And, I do mean few ... like hardly any. The sandwich was hot and flavorless and overpriced for what it was. Darin was the only good thing about the place.  I make fun of people who go to the Olive Garden, but I wish we had gone there instead.  At least I would have gotten endless salad and good dressing."}
{"text":"Great spot - yes, a chain, but good food and quick!  Ordered an order for pick up and it was ready when I arrived (less than 10 minutes!).  Food was very good as well."}
{"text":"Sorry Romano's Macaroni Grill but it seems that your quality of food has gone down quite a bit since the last time I ate there. While the staff is is pleasant, the food is sub-par at best. I remember how a couple of years ago, I used to love going here. What happened RMG? Did the economy force you to take shortcuts with food prep? Or did it cause you to switch to using lower quality ingredients? 

Regardless, our experience was decent in terms of service but food was bland and boring. The fried macaroni bites had no flavor to them what so ever but do admit the fried sole was awesome. Overall though, I think RMG went the way of Olive Garden in terms of Italian food."}
{"text":"I went into this restaurant expecting nothing. I know Romano's is a chain. I was greeted by a Hollywood-faced hostess with a smile worthy of the Disney channel who seated my family and I immediately. The place was spotless and actually resembled more of a formal dining room than a chain near a shopping center. I ordered a steak and salad, two dishes of anti pasta (meatballs and papadew peppers) and my kids shared a pizza.

It was surprisingly amazing and better than any meal I'd had at the resort we were staying at (JW Marriott Desert Ridge). I am going to a Macaroni grill in the future. The server was exceptionally well mannered and quick. Our food was out in minutes. I ordered a gin martini and instead of being presumptuous by taking liberties and giving me the most costly gun at the bar, he gave me the house. 

I love it. I can't believe macaroni grill had so much class!"}
{"text":"It wasn't \"A-Ok\", but I am not a huge fan either. Macaroni grill deserves a little more than an A-okay. It's for sure better than Olive Garden and great for a fast Italian chain. The food was actually decent and reasonably priced.  I will come back again."}
{"text":"This rating is for my Takeout experience tonight -

Calling to put the order in took sometime. We were put on hold for sometime and then someone hung up on us. I will chalk that one off to being Sunday night, even though the place wasn't crazy crowded. 

Pros - It is a franchise, so the food is always the exact same way every darn time. 
The price is always great for the same darn reason. The bread is the bomb!

Cons - It took 20 mins for the food to get done. Plus the 15 mins to get the order submitted. It is not in Summerlin!!!!!"}
{"text":"Shrimp portofino was good, but a little on the bland side. It need a little more sauce or salt. Free bread is always good! Caesar salad was ok not anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Reasons this is 4 stars:

Happy hour: basically got two glasses of red for $3. (Not terrible wine either!) Need I say more? 

Food: considering it is a chain, you can tell that for the most part they put effort into their ingredients. I had the seafood cioppino ravioli - which at a chain should be terrifying. The sauce had a nice kick to it and there were real chunks of garlic. The seafood was also surprisingly well cooked. The squid was not over cooked (e.g. when it is really chewy). You could tell the shrimp where frozen previously and the muscles where not the freshest but then again this is a chain. 

Service: I sat at the bar; I was stranded on a work trip and flights where being cancelled right and left. The service was good for being at the bar. They had some wine tastings going on but you could tell that the bartender kept an eye on everyone. 

If you find yourself stranded in this area without a car to experience the cleveland food scene, this is an option you don't have to think too far into."}
{"text":"Everybody treated us really good tonight the hostess got us a table pretty quick the waiter Was excellent. The penne rustica has the chicken and shrimp and had a little spice. The pasta Milano was the bowtie pasta with chicken and mushrooms. My 11-year-old daughter had to have the pork chop and I tasted it and it was delicious and the risotto was creamy and the mushrooms were awesome. My only complaint is it's too far from my home in Gilbert."}
{"text":"These people get 2 stars because the manager was nice,  but it was some of the worst food I have ever experienced.

We had a couple appetizers (fried mac n' cheese, shrimp on toast) which were decent, but nothing special.  

What stood out in particular was the Mama's Trio.  This includes lasagna, chicken parmesan, and chicken cannelloni.  The lasagna was obviously reheated (who hasn't had reheated lasagna at one point or another), they didn't even bother to reheat the cannelloni ( or as I call it, cold, rock hard pasta burrito).  The chicken was decent, but again, I expect more for $18 dollars.  

All in all, a pretty bad experience here.  I'd rather eat a Banquet TV dinner, at least that way I could save $16.50."}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while and glad we chose here to eat. We started out with calamari and mozzarella, loved those. The marinara and sun-dried tomoato sauce on the side was good. Then for the main course, I had the grilled lamb chops (has a creamy mustard sauce on top) with grilled veggies and red potatoes. I highly recommend that if you like lamb chops! My husband had the shrimp alfredo and my son had the spicy ricotta meatballs. All of it came out great! And definitely recommend their ginger cream soda! Service was excellent as well, our servers name was Bryan. He was super nice and attentive. Overall we had a great experience and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Went with a large group of 8 for a business dinner.  The service was a bit lacking - our waiter seemed to disappear at times and prolonged the dinner.  It was fine because we had a lot to discuss, but out out-of-town guest were probably tired from a long day of training so it would have been nice to make dinner a bit shorter.

I ordered the penne rustica and it came to the table in a piping hot bowl.  It was nice the put a plate under it and I definitely devoured the whole thing."}
{"text":"Customer service was good!   My daughter and I ordered our food, I got lobster ravioli and she got steak and potatoes.  When I got my ravioli I started to eat it and it instantly tasted foul.  I quickly gave it back to the server to order something else.  Went home and my daughter and I both got food poisoning.  I called the manager the next morning and informed him of what happened.  A few days later someone from their corporate office called and informed me that I'd be receiving a refund for the entire bill.  I was surprised by this because my intention was to just let them know about the incident so that they didn't serve it to anyone else without checking the food."}
{"text":"I have to say upfront that I have had many good experiences at this restaurant . I do not know what happened today. We had a table of 8. Food preparation was fine but I have never had such terrible service. The whole table ordered drinks and it took at least 1/2 hour to finally get our first round. Then another 30 mins for the 2nd round (nothing complicated bloody Mary's, beer, and Mimosas) Finally the 2nd round showed up but without the beer? (Said they had to change the keg). Usually the bartenders are very quick but I went up to purchase directly from the bar and there was no bartender! Everyone at the table was celebrating birthdays but rather than wait another 30 mins for dessert- we just left. I do not know where management was today but what a shame to ruin 20 good experiences with 1 awful one."}
{"text":"I don't have much upon which to base my review as I've only been here a few times and only remembered what I ordered the last time; however, that last dish was worth reviewing.

Carmella's Chicken Rigatoni was a fantastic, rich pasta dish that was big enough to warrant leftovers for a tasty lunch the next day.  It features chicken, mushrooms, carmelized onions, and basil in a creamy Marsala sauce.  Start your meal with their tasty ciabatta bread (don't forget the olive oil for dipping!), have yourself some rigatoni, and call it a night!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday recently, it was a Monday evening around 7pm not packed at all which was kinda nice, it was actually quiet. Loved the ambiance, dim lighting, stone walls, the wine/drinks were delish! Our waitress was friendly and quick, the bread they give you ahead of time was so good, perfectly crunchy and soft at the same time... but the rest of the food was really just blah-okay. We got the portobello fries for an appetizer and they were very heavily breaded, sauces were good but you couldn't even taste the mushroom, they actually tasted more like fish sticks. I got the chicken parm, also more breading than chicken and the capellini pasta they serve with it was pretty spicy and hard to eat a lot of and enjoy. My boyfriend got the Signature Mac & Cheese which was also VERY spicy and the noodles were like small bead shapes, the cheese they use didn't really have a good or strong cheese flavor. The rest of my family got 3 different pizza flavors, I tried a couple slices of the margarita pizza, a little flavorless but it was light and the crust was very good, I think they mentioned actually using a brick oven here.
Overall I think everything else here was okay, the food wasn't horrible but it wasn't crave worthy either, I'm not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service had my birthday dinner there everyone was very friendly from the time we made the reservations until  we left.John was a great waiter. The GM Chad was wonderful spoke to him to make arrangements to hold my birthday cake and make a reservation and he was so welcoming. This place comes highly recommended. Large portions and great prices."}
{"text":"Bad food, service is ok, management is nice, but cooks really need some help, we have had bad food almost every time and had to send stuff back"}
{"text":"Ordered this through Postmates and it was so delicious. We ordered the butternut squash tortellini and a pasta with chicken and rosemary cream sauce.  Both were bomb and so satisfying. We also ordered two salads which were fresh and a good start to the meal."}
{"text":"Started off with hard cold bread waitress said it was because it was reheated... then cold tomato soup that was suppose to be hot had to resent , then got cold pizza .. manager did apologize and the food was free but the dinner was ruined . We won't go back again"}
{"text":"most horrible experience i have ever had at a restaurant. The pasta was very under cooked and the pasta sauce had no taste. horrible unprofessional wait staff"}
{"text":"Bad service and not so good tasting food. 
I have not been in for a while. We came Sunday 730pm for dinner, place was empty, they had about 3 tables being occupied when we walked in. Food is different now, its not as good as it was before. 
Service was even worst. Our server was not very attentive. Took about 40 mins for the our soup to arrive. Another server tried to help, very nice sweet guy but boy.... he had a very powerful bad breath. It was very strong although he was about 3ft away from us, and the bad odor stays few minutes after he left."}
{"text":"I was forced to handle some business on this side of town and found myself eating lunch at this Macaroni Grill. I normally stay in Scottsdale and abhor the west side of the valley. Oddly enough, the entire experience was phenomenal. The bread was warm, the drinks were cold, and the food had the right amount of salt. The service was attentive from the server to the hostess. Even the lanky manager, Larry, came by to see my table. He cleared plates and made a tiramissou recommendation. We ate it, it was ok. All in all, if I have to travel to the west side again, I would eat there. I do love salt and fat."}
{"text":"I love Macaroni Grill. I ordered the pasta Milano and I absolutely love it. The waiters and waitresses are always very attentive and it's always nice to enjoy the random lady singing opera from time to time. I suggest ordering the pizza and the pasta Milano."}
{"text":"Please do yourself and request to be sat in Lamads section. 

Last time we came my boyfriend got the Pasta Milano, but the chicken came out under cooked. Lamad went above and beyond to take care of this issue. 

We came back tonight and requested to sit in his section and he didn't miss a beat. Bread came out hot and fresh, salad came out soon after, and then the entrees. 

He didn't miss a beat with drink refills.
We will return :)"}
{"text":"Although some think of Macaroni Grill as a chain, I think each one is a bit different from my experience. On this trip to Vegas we went here twice and it was a good choice each time. The Bruschetta is very pleasing to me and with a caesar salad it makes a full lunch! The bread and the spiced oil is fun and I have to be careful of I will eat to much bread. Any body else ever have that problem? The stuffed mushroom on our second visit disappeared almost as soon as they hit the table. (there were 10 of us for dinner)  Carmella's chicken with the Marsala wrapped it up for me! So even in the summer in Vegas when the heat is brutal, macaroni grill is a very cool place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"There's not much they care about their patrons. They have never contacted me about anything. I hope they go bankrupt and live on the streets."}
{"text":"The last Macaroni Grill that I ate at was back in 2008 with my boyfriend (now husband) and we LOVED it. The atmosphere was great and it was reasonably priced.

We ate here for lunch with my parents right after we got into Vegas because Urbanspoon indicated that they had gluten free options (for my mom and sister). 

And here is where I want to go into a little rant. If you're in the food industry, you should care about food. (I'm not talking about teenagers working as waitresses at a TGIFridays.) I'm talking about managers of restaurants who charge more than $12/plate. 

I don't appreciate watching someone become rude with my mother while she makes sure my sister doesn't get sick by eating YOUR FOOD. 

Management didn't help at all and the waitress couldn't have looked more bored. No one asked us if our food was good (because it wasn't...it was greasy) and I don't plan on going back to any Macaroni Grill in the near future."}
{"text":"I think another location would be better, but I think the cooks just don't care.  We went when it was slow.  Only about six other tables and it was about two hours before closing.  

1.  Their famous bread? I had to ask for another.  The outside was so hard it took multiple attempts to cut into it with a knife to break it apart.  

2.  Carmela's Chicken.  Greasy.  I'm not sure if they use actual Marsala wine in this sauce or not, but it tasted like it didn't have enough of the alcohol cooked off.  It tasted like you made the dish, then poured a splash of wine over it.  

3.  Pollo Caprese.  Chicken breast was dry, tasteless, and 100% devoid of any level of moisture or seasoning and it was also burned.  This happens when a cook \"lays down\" the spatula on top of the chicken in order to get it to cook faster.  The buffalo mozzarella was cold, watery,  and resembled large pieces of chewing gum...not the nice slices that you normally see.  I'm really not sure where the \"caprese\" part comes in.  There was no basil whatsoever in this dish.

4.  Bibb and Bleu salad...had been clearly sitting around for a little while before it came to the table.  Lettuce was not crisp and it was not refrigerator cold.

Sad disappointment.  Never again.  This was not a $40 meal."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite chain restaurants to have dinner. Our server, Odie, always makes the evening enjoyable. The kids love the bread and their scaloppine is great."}
{"text":"I like Italian food and I've had and enjoyed Macaroni Grill before.  Something is afoot with what was once one of my favorite places to eat.  It's lost is zest and not just in the food.  This visit failed to impress.  Our group of 8 began our visit waiting at the podium for what must have been about 8-10 minutes before someone acknowledged our existence.  We were sat down in the middle of the restaurant on what turned out to be a day where the drafts were blowing cold.  You could feel it every time the door opened up.  We were there for a birthday but everything seemed to take a long time.  They possibly could have been short-handed.  The waiter was nice enough but didn't jot enough details down to let him know who had what including the drinks.  The food was good but not something that knocked your Italian-food-lovin socks off.  And the portions were small (and I had a pasta dish).  We told the waiter about the birthday but I guess he spaced it when he gave us our check without bringing the cake.  We reminded and he obliged after that.  For the price paid, I expected better...everything.  I'll give it another try but for now it gets only 2 Canolis from this foodie."}
