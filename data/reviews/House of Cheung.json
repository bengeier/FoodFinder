{"text":"Just ordered $50 worth of delivery and it went straight in the garbage. Meat all tasted spoiled. Beef was gray. Half of it was luke warm and took an hour to arrive. Not had such bad luck with them in the past but will definitely not order from them again. Yuck!"}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!




Absolutely the worst food I've ever had from a restaurant. This place is usually populated by 2-4 people drinking beer at a table, and there's a reason. Don't eat here.

{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.  I am pretty sure the chicken wasn't chicken.  At least I didn't get sick afterwards."}
{"text":"Are you seriously inquiring about this restaurant? You probably haven't ever been to this restaurant cuz its disgusting and so are you if you're ACTUALLY gonna eat here.  

The cheap beers attract all the west-end freaks from coffee time and happy cup bar.  Upon entering the restaurant you will notice a lobster tank.  The lobsters appear to be very old--they have varicose veins and liver spots. The food doesn't taste good at all.  The meat is old and bland with weird unjustifiable textures and the rice is a big fat meh. I recommend visiting the restaurant if you wanna feel uncomfortable for 15-20 mins as a bunch of grimey alcoholics wearing neon windbreakers from the early 90s (courtesy of value village) chug $3 Canadians. 

ew.

{"text":"I will always remember House of Cheung as the location of one of my first marriage proposals... from a total stranger!

I was cycling home and decided to stop by this place since I wanted some Chinese food. 

This restaurant is located in a kind of sketchy location with people who yell randomness at you while you're walking the street. House of Cheung is also a tavern, with most of the patrons drinking rather than eating. While waiting for my order, one of these drunks kept bugging other guests including me, trying to woo them and propose to them. 

The food was mediocre at best. They have reasonable pricing with all but one \"Dinner for one\" specials costing less than $10. However, most of the food in my order was bland. They do give a fair amount of food for what you pay though.   

If I ever order from House of Cheung again, it'll be through delivery because I won't be stepping into this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We've been ordering House of Cheung's authentic 70s style Chinese delivery for years.  Love the sweet and sour chicken balls, can't go wrong with the egg rolls, chicken fried rice just like the good ole days. Always comes with free fortune cookies. It is what it is and it does it well."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy or flashy.  Tried the shrimp in garlic sauce while eating in.  Food was ok, but we quickly realized this is more of a takeout/delivery type place.  Staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"straight out of 70s this is the sort of place that you would never go on a first date to, in fact even if eat there likely you grab it to go..maybe its the $3.50 beer and the fact that you'll likely always find a \"local\" sitting in the front..the truth is the food is good, not spadina good, but above your typical Chinese restaurant good..i usually get the yeung chow rice, fried spicy squid, oyster beef and general tao chicken and have never been disappointed..give it a try, you'll be glad you did."}
