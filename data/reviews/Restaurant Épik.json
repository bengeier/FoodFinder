{"text":"We happened upon this place while visiting Old Montreal. Walked in there for dinner with hubby and my kids (7 & 9) while touring around. AMAZING from start to finish! My youngest loved the quail egg appetizers and dumplings. Sushi was creative and the best tasting we've had in years. Fresh and well presented. We'll DEFINITELY be coming back when we visit again!!"}
{"text":"We were a large group and everybody loved everything!  Even the bread and olive oil was amazing!  Small restaurant, very nice and cozy and great service.   Withought a doubt will be returning!"}
{"text":"It must have been written in the stars that we (4 foodie, boozy Bostonians) would find this place. The food was amazing, the service impeccable!! It didn't hurt that the entire staff was gorgeous. Silvio, the owner, took SUCH good care of us. We've never experienced such warmth, generosity, and sincere care. Our late lunch experience was so fabulous that we had to repeat it. The food far exceeded our expectations - wowed us, in fact- and the wine selections were lovely. We will be coming back again on our next visit to Montreal. I can only imagine that the hotel services are just as fabulous."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food, decor, location, service and cocktails were all great.  Absolutely nothing bad to say about it."}
{"text":"Nous avons visité ce restaurant pour la première fois lorsqu'on fêtait nos 1 ans et demi ensemble. Le personnel est super chaleureux et accueillant. La nourriture était délicieuse et les boissons étaient de bon goût aussi. Les employés ont tous leurs rôles respectifs mais ils sont très accomodants."}
{"text":"We took a trip to Montreal to celebrate my husbands 40th. We found this restaurant on yelp and thought we would give it a try. The service was great, the food mediocre. My husband had the mushroom ravioli and there was no flavor to his dish. It was extremely bland. I had the shrimp and risotto and felt that the arugula was the best part, so disappointing. The bread and wine were good, but we wish we had chosen a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Attentiveness of overall staff was excellent. Food was ridiculously amazing! Risotto Funghini fabulously paired with a 2010 Antinori Tignanello! I'd come back again in a minute!!"}
{"text":"I went to a networking event in Old Montreal in May where they were showcasing all the good stuff of that neighborhood, The Epik team was there and I had a taste of their succulent meatballs. The meatballs were so good that I made it a mission to visit their restaurant.  Almost three months later (Yeah, I'm not very fast), as I was walking in Old Montreal, I came across their restaurant and decided to try it for lunch.  The Epik restaurant is located in the boutique hotel of the same name and therefore decorated with refinement. I was seated on their beautiful intimate terrace.  I ordered the Polpette (beef meatballs with tomato sauce and basil-whipped ricotta) accompanied by grilled market vegetables (10$) and their Caffe e Bomboloni (a donut stuffed with Nutella 4$), everything was excellent !! The meatballs were soft and well seasoned, the grilled vegetables were crispy and the dessert was not too sweet.  The service was excellent, the team was just as friendly as during that networking event in May. I specified that I was in a hurry and the service was perfectly seamless.  I recommend this place for anyone looking for originality in their lunch!"}
{"text":"I can only agree with the reviews below. This place is incredible! The atmosphere like a hip bar/lounge and the food like a 5 star restaurant. The mojitos were also delicious. I honestly didn't want to leave this place. Waiters speak perfect English and are super nice and helpful as well. Should i return to Montreal one day, this restaurant is on my list of things to visit."}
{"text":"Started with the calamari app. It was decent. Nothing special. A bit breadie for my tastes. The seafood risotto was also nothing to write home about. I was expecting large scallops for that prize but I was sadly mistaken..."}
{"text":"Sweet, cozy tapas restaurant located inside a boutique hotel along St. Paul West. Everything was sooo good, and we loved watching the chef make everything fresh. Service was prompt and polite (also spoke perfect English, which we appreciated as travelers from the US), and prices were fair considering these were generous portions for tapas style. Also, the martini was perfect. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stellar meal with a fantastic ambiance, superb service, and a truly spectacular experience. I had seared veal and pasta and my spouse a lovely mushroom risotto. It is a small, quaint, and very personalized dining experience. David was quite a character but was just the right balance of personality and solid server. A truly fabulous meal we will likely remember for years to come."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner here tonight! Started with the cheese plate which was lovely in its presentation and more then adequate for two people. The entrees that followed, the bolognese with gnocchi and the sirloin steak were well prepared. All of this was surrounded by the sweet melodies of the guitarist featured in the front dining room, lending a relaxed sophisticated atmosphere to our dining experience."}
{"text":"Cocktails and ambiance were pretty nice. Definitely a nice place environment.  The food was not great though. Asked what the best things on the menu were and ordered Caprese Salad, Gnocchi and Veal.  Gnocchi was far from good. Chewy. The veal was dry. So overall. Not the best.  Caprese salad was what you would expect.   I am surprised by all the high reviews. Something doesn't add up."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great staff and relaxing ambiance. I will definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the best Italian meal I've had in a very long time! We had red pepper bisque soup and the butternut squash gnocchi which were both simply perfect. Beignets were also delicious!!! Our server was also very good. This place is part of a hotel so you could easily miss it when walking by. But I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Nice terrace seating in the back of the hotel.  We all had pasta dishes, which were excellent, as were the salad starters. Service was very friendly.  When we left, we saw that the terrace platform was actually part of a parking lot but we couldn't tell when we were seated because of the way the fence was constructed.  Clever use of space!"}
{"text":"Italian food tonight. The restaurant is nice and with a special atmosphere. Make a reservation because it is not big. Food was great: insalat di barbabietola with goat cheese light and tasty; seabass with orzo and veggie and my boyfriend veal involtini: all a 10/10. And to finish tiramisi: nice creamy super ... Aperitivo at the level of the dinner as well as the red wine Valpolicella. Service at the top. A great place to eat while in Montreal."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner. We had the best cocktails. Justin the bartender Came out to our table because I was raving about the old fashion that he made. Honestly probably one of the best meals we have ever had. And the BEST Old Fashion!!! The environment was fabulous the service was great. Frank was our waiter. We enjoyed the entire experience. Do not walk to this restaurant, Run!!"}
{"text":"I went on the weekend of MTL à table, I have to say the service was excellent, super nice staff and very nice decor.  I had the Black-inked linguine, it was good but way too sweet.  In conclusion, I had a great time and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love the whole atmosphere specially the lighting is just alright. Waiters are nice and patient to explain the menu. The seafood soup is the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Ce resto est une catastrophe. On s'est fait mettre à la porte alors que nous avions réservé pour 6 en terrasse et que nous nous sommes présentés à l'heure. Le problème c'est que le directeur François, avec qui j'ai parlé au moins 3 fois dans le courant de la semaine, m'avait assuré que notre réservation était faite pour 6 personnes et en terrasse. Quand nous sommes arrivés, il nous a donné une table à l'intérieur et m'a indiqué qu'il n'y avait plus de place en terrasse alors que j'avais confirmé avec lui une table pour 6 en terrasse. Lorsque je l'ai confronté, il a osé me dire qu'il n'avait jamais confirmé la table en terrasse (donc je suis une menteuse) et qu'il me proposait une table à l'intérieur (le but ayant été de passer une soirée avec des amis en terrasse). Bref, il m'a proposé deux choix : soit la table à l'intérieur, soit la porte et il m'a montré la porte avec son doigt et j'ai des témoins, mes amies qui étaient là) C'est la première fois de ma vie que je me fais montrer la porte alors que j'ai été dans des restos dans des grandes villes comme New York, Paris, Lyon, Milan, etc... Et je compte porter plainte. Que vous dire de plus. C'est la première fois de ma vie que dans un resto on me pointe la porte et par le directeur du resto François. Une catastrophe!"}
{"text":"Their Frutti di Mare is really good + prosciutto y formaggio too! We thought it looked like a good restaurant so we went to it to eat dinner on our last night of our visit from Austin TX to Montreal. We ate dinner there & it was really good 5 Days after we saw it.  We hope you have a good dinner at restaurant Epik. (Review by Luke age 7)"}
{"text":"Nous sommes entrée un peu par hasard dans ce restaurant italien de la rue Saint-Paul hier soir. Ce fut la meilleure décision de la soirée! Atmosphère relaxe, musique live, personnel discret et courtois. Le niveau de bruit est très bas et c''est agréable de se parler sans avoir à hurler pour se faire entendre.  Les calmars frits, les légumes grillés et fromage de chèvre en entrée étaient excellents. Mon conjoint a mangé les rouleaux de veau farci aux épinard et à la ricotta, il a adoré. Mes gnocchis sauce bolognaise étaient également délicieux et les portions sont très généreuses! Notre serveur fut attentionné et a offert un excellent service. C'est avec grand plaisir que j'y retournerai!"}
{"text":"Ate here our first night in Montreal and had some of the best food ever! Everything from the \"tasting\" board to the dessert was fresh and delicious. The waiters were extremely helpful and nice. I will be here again next time we visit."}
{"text":"Best. Lunch. Ever. The food....the staff...the wine. Cannot recommend more highly. J'taime, Epik!"}
{"text":"C'était vraiment délicieux ! Leur formule du midi avec choix de boulettes (5$) et accompagnement (5$) est vraiment génial. La formule change des menus lunch habituel et le concept est vraiment cool! L'endroit est superbe, le personnel est très sympathique, on y mange très bien, le quartier est agréable ... que dire de plus ? Allez-y ! Perso, je me suis régalée et j'y retournerai !"}
{"text":"Surprisingly great Italian food! The meatballs and pastas were great! Service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner and really friendly and helpful staff. We enjoyed the meal and the desserts are amazing!"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful sunny day and we wanted to have dinner on a terrace. I saw a recommendation on his place, went to check the menu online and thought it'd be a great idea!  The terrace is very cute. It is situated behind their boutique hotel. Medium intimate compared to some other terraces in the neighborhood. The staff is very courteous, helpful, attentive and funny.   We took some cocktails which were good. The food menu is nice, you have a table d'hotes option as well which we went with. The starters were good, unfortunately the red snapper was dry & over-cooked. And since we both took the same main, I cannot confirm that other dishes were good or not. (The one good thing was that I was half full just with the starter so it didn't bother me as much)   I would definitely come back here for drinks and snacks but I'm not too sure about dinner. As the service & everything else was awesome, it made it a very pleasant visit."}
{"text":"Amazing place... loved it! The chicken was delicious and so was the pasta.   Great selection of vine and champagne!  Great!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We had the risotto fruti di mare and the linguini fruti di mare. Both were very good almost perfect except the mussels were just s bit overdone. Service was amazing."}
{"text":"Bon service, beau décor, les entrés étaient bien mais nos steak étaient de piètre qualité.De plus si vous manger à l'intérieur et à l'arrière du resto, vous serez assurer de ressortir aussi enfumé que votre viande! ( brume blanche en prime) . Le vin a un ratio de presque  3x le prix de la SAQ... c'est un peu exagéré. Ils cherchent à jouer aux grands resto mais ... pour un hotel les toilettes laissent grandement à désirer en propreté."}
{"text":"Came here for a nice dinner and wasn't disappointed. The food was good and so was the atmosphere sitting outside. We had to wait a while for our food, but the waiter was so friendly that it made up for it.  The flavor in the pollo al forno was subtle and the fried calamari could have been more tender but all in all this was a really nice place to eat."}
{"text":"Such a cute find with great hospitality. The food was amazing and the wine was great. We had the special pumpkin gnocchi with lasagna and dessert.  The service was also really amazing they filled our water and wine and checked up on us frequently enough so that we didn't feel like we were abandoned. The music was also live but not overly  loud so that you couldn't have a conversation.  If you are in the old Montreal area I highly recommend you stopping here for an amazing dinner."}
