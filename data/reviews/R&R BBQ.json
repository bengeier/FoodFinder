{"text":"Great family restaurant! My home town is Charlotte NC but fam has migrated all around Concord area where we found this jewel.  I plan to eat there every time I am in town. Breakfast is my favorite meal there. I am a livermush lover and they fry it up just right. My favorite meal is livermush, eggs, grits and toast. YUM-YUM! When I do eat lunch or dinner I always get some of their awesome banana pudding. 

They had 3 locations but are down to only this one but it has a constant following. Try it if you are in the area.

{"text":"We tried R & R Barbecue based on Yelp reviews, however when we went in July 2010 we were very disappointed in the quality of the food. My barbecue was \"ok\" but my wife found a (human) hair in hers. That definitely put a damper on things. The Brunswick stew, an upgraded side, was watery and not worth the trouble. The hushpuppies were very good. Atmosphere was about what you'd expect for a NC BBQ place. Overall, I'd say leave this one to the locals."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq at an excellent price.  Cannot beat the value for your dollar.  Friendly fast service.   Seems a favorite lunch hangout of cops."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a local restaurant with reasonable prices and friendly service, this is the place for you. I usually come in the morning for the $4.55 breakfast special. You get one egg (prepared however you like), a choice of bacon or sausage (get the sausage, the bacon tastes like a pre-made microwave product), grits, bread (I always get wheat toast) and coffee. 

It's a great deal. You can get an entire meal, served with a smile, for the same price as one item from Starbucks. The atmosphere is cozy and country. They have a few tvs so you can watch headline news or Live with Kelly and Michael while you eat. 

This spot is also known for its BBQ, I'll have to come back one evening to give it a try."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I tasted in my time at North Carolina. Cheap, tasty, tender. Do yourself a favor -- go for the barbecue with coleslaw, fried corn, and hush puppies. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love bbq amd enjoy traveling to NC to try new places.  This place does not compare to any of the great BBQ I've had in the state. My son got sick after eating a hot dog here the evening before. The BBQ pork was bland and tasted like it had no seasoning. The only thing that saved it was the sweeter sauce. The service was quick and friendly which was a plus. My recommendation is to eat at a BBQ  chain before going here."}
{"text":"Everyone needs a place like this in their life.  It is where you go when you don't know where to go.  The food is pretty good for what it is.  The waitstaff is friendly and helpful.  They have both vinegar-based sauce and the thick, sweet, brown stuff for your barbeque.  More importantly they make a good Brunswick stew and yes, a thick-cut fried bologna sandwich."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. 

The last two times I've been here, some of the food items were cold.  

The service is kind of hit or miss.  

And it seems like they've been moving their prices up fairly quickly.  

Ate there tonight.  Asked for some onion as flavoring.  At checkout, learned they charged me $2.00 for a bit of onion.  I realize it's just $2.00, but they never charged me for it before and didn't inform me of the charge in advance tonight.  

The girl at the register said (in a less than pleasant tone) if they bring it in a bowl, they charge $2.00 for it.  I pointed out that it wasn't in a bowl, but in a plate.  She just rolled her eyes.  

So, partially cold food, hit or miss service, unpleasant cash register person all add up to me not going back for a while (if ever)."}
{"text":"Walked in, sat ourselves and waited over ten minutes for the waitress to even notice we were there. She took our drink orders and we waited over 5 minutes while she chit chatted with another waitress. Told her we were there for the first time and she looked at me like \"why in the heck would I care?\" I asked her to explain specials or favorites of the customers and she got very irritated. How the heck would I know, it was my first time there and I didn't see much bbq on the menu. Ordered our food and it did come out quickly, which was nice. 1/4 white meat chicken was really good. Potato salad was very good as well. Baked beans were....eh. She checked on us once and gave us a cup of coke to pour into our cups as refills. 2 people at the table had coke so we had to share the one cup she brought over. It was really odd to have to pour our own drinks. They don't write the total at the bottom of the check, and you don't get an itemized receipt (it's really old school). I double checked our total against the menu prices and added tax. They got us for almost $5. Will NEVER return. Food was so-so, staff was lazy and not friendly at all and they ripped us off. Bad experience to say the least."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great value. A great place to feed the family. We enjoy their BQ and hush puppies."}
{"text":"Best barbeque in the Charlotte area! Sides are delicious. You can get a sandwich, platter or tray. If pork isn't your style, they have chicken. You can get a 1/4 or 1/2 chicken. The wait staff hustles and they are very friendly. They can accommodate 2 people or a party of 10 (maybe more). They also have a kid's menu. If you are ready to get your BBQ on, I strongly recommend R&R."}
{"text":"I love the BBQ here.  It is juicy and full of flavor.  The inside is rather large with plenty of room.  The only thing is the price rating of 1 ($) is not accurate.  This place is expensive.  I ordered the combo plate 1/4 chicken and BBQ and wife got a BLT sandwich.  I walked out w a mid 30's bill.  Don't get me wrong the BBQ is simply awesome! but you will drop some coin to get it."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and it did not dissappoint. Great pulled pork and babyback ribs. The chicken is good as well.
I tried the fried corn as suggested by other posters. Hush puppies are yummy, and Brunswick stew is good. 
I ve been back a few times since, and will keep going back..."}
{"text":"Great Food Great Service.  Was passing through from Atlanta and found R and R on Yelp.  Pleasant surprise.  Had the baby back ribs.  Tender and tasty.  Service was off the chart.  Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"I have eaten many times here over the years. Most recently, I dined there this week. It's not a fancy restaurant in the least, but a great spot for fast service and tasty NC style pork BBQ. They offer both sweet red or vinegar sauce. They also have creamy and BBQ slaw. The small pulled pork plate is more than enough with a heavy portion of pulled pork, slaw of your choice, and crispy hushpuppies. The BBQ ribs are also fall off the bone. Don't stray from the BBQ on the menu and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"R&R is a great place for traditional southern BBQ.  My family and I have always had good food there.  The service is great, the food is good and flavorful all for a great price."}
{"text":"Good size portions. The BBQ ribs are mouth watering same goes for the fried okra. Southern BBQ at its best."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food in a relaxed, family friendly environment.  Tender, tasty barbecue--the best I have had in NC (or elsewhere).  Tangy, fall off the bone ribs.   Delicious hush puppies--I've not found better ones yet.  Service always prompt & friendly.  Recommend the banana pudding to end ( or take home for later).  I highly recommend R & R Barbecue."}
{"text":"Yummy BBQ and fast service. Really good sweet tea, loved the hush puppies! Servers were not overly friendly but not rude, kinda quiet in there when we went so it was like we were listening to them all chat on their \"break\" which was a bit off putting. Clean, nice location."}
{"text":"We love to go to R&R!! Food and service are great! Wide variety of items on the menu. Great burgers, hot dogs, ribs and of course BBQ. We go there every week."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing the ribs is my top pick with Cole slaw and fried corn on a cob.. but I can't go on without mentioning the racism in here.. made us feel very unwelcomed.."}
{"text":"Just visited this place on the 30 april 2010, and the food was not very good. The atmosphere was ok with the trains running around. But over all the menu was not very extensive, and what they did have was a little over priced. The staff was awesome. I ordered the full rack of ribs and my wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich, the best thing there was the fried corn on the cob, yes i said fried corn.  I will not be going back there again ill look for some where else to eat next time."}
{"text":"Awesome food, price & atmosphere. We walked in at 8pm & were able to find a table right away. The staff was very friendly & amazingly attentive. We will definitely return again. The deep friend corn on the cob is amazing as well as the okra, hush puppies, pulled pork, rack of ribs, chicken, and especially the mac & cheese."}
{"text":"Great bbq! Not a bad price either. The layout is a little weird though. This is a true southern pulled BBQ place. Service was good, food was really great, drinks were never empty. My son had wings and said they were sub-par. Why would anyone order wings from a bbq place?"}
{"text":"Love R&R! It's our absolute favorite locally owned area restaurant! Great food and always good service!"}
{"text":"WOW is all I can say about this place.  The Baby Back Ribs are simply the best I have ever had.  I have traveled all over the US and have had ribs in Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas and more.  R&R beat those hands down and will put them  to shame if R&R ever goes up head-to-head with them.

 Rob, one of the owners made my brother and I feel very welcome and as if he had known us for a long time.  Some of the regulars who visit there kept telling us how often they come back and how good the food was. 

Sorry, I did not have room left for dessert, but the homemade Banana Pudding looked simply awesome.  

This place is kind of hidden but we lucked out and drove past it on the way to the Charlotte Speedway.  On our way back to our hotel we stopped and are we very glad we did.  

You will not be disappointed if you do stop.  My suggestion is the ribs, of course, but let me warn you.  A full portion is more than one person can eat.  Half rack would have been enough.  But you know what.  I brought the other home to my wife, so I got to enjoy R&R's good food twice."}
{"text":"My kids love this place and call it \"the restaurant.\"  The food is very consistent and the portions are huge. We've ordered carry out from them as well as catering and it's always been excellent. The BBQ pork can't be beat and the prices are great. Highly recommend for a family dinner or casual bite out!"}
{"text":"Very small salad, very small plates with normal portions, lousy, sparse menu.  Food was just ok.o. Service was good. Ambience not so good"}
{"text":"R&R is a great place to grab some quality NC bbq! They have great plates, sandwiches, and sides. I also highly recommend the hush puppies. The servers can be a little unfriendly during busy times, but the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"The closest BBQ restaurant to my home and office is a larger joint in Concord just off of I-85 and Poplar Tent Road. R&R BBQ has a good business and on any weekday or weekend you'll see a good crowd there for lunch. I hadn't been to R&R in several years but since it had been awhile I decided that they were due for another visit.

R&R has a lot of square footage and a fun atmosphere with two model trains circling on tracks suspended from the ceiling. You'll see that they express their BBQ heritage proudly and make references to the common North Carolina expression that BBQ is a noun here and not a verb. They also promise a \"true Eastern NC Style Pork BBQ experience\". 

All of their talk of tradition and \"real BBQ\" are completely laughable if for one reason only. They use absolutely no smoke in the cooking process and rely completely on gas. Sure in NC we say with conviction that BBQ is a noun but someone needs to tell R&R that smoke is not only a noun but also a VERB. They disrespect NC BBQ tradition by not using any smoke during the cooking process. 

This is too bad because they get just about everything else right. The hush puppies are just right, the may based cole slaw I had were good and their Eastern style sauce and KC bbq sauce are both well done. The sweet tea also hits the spot.

R&R obviously has a robust business while dishing out bad BBQ so I doubt there is any real incentive to change. It's still hard for me to understand why a restaurant with BBQ in it's name can't invest in an electric or gas smoker if they want to keep it simple. Randy's in Troutman does this and their Q still retains a great smoked flavor.

North Carolina sure do as the Germans do with beer and pass a few purity laws regarding BBQ with the first and foremost requirement be that smoke is used in the cooking process.

If you head to R&R the best thing to do is forget they have BBQ in their name and just grab a burger or wings. They do a much more authentic job of those."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. This is an old school, \"find your seat, order your food\" establishment. The food is great, the servers are friendly, and the prices are reasonable. 

One note to make is if you wait until after 7 to go eat you will run the risk of NOT getting BBQ, especially on Friday nights on brisket night."}
{"text":"Ordered the combination plate of BBQ & Ribs along with green beans and fried corn on the cob. The plate was full and ended up taking food home. Two ears or corn I was only expecting one. I did ask for a bun to eat with my BBQ and wasn't charged which was nice.  Hush puppies were good, ribs fell off the bone and had great flavor. I'm not a huge fan of vinegar flavored BBQ, but it was light and I put the BBQ sauce on it and that was the best part. The BBQ sauce was a slam dunk. Amazing smoky flavor and tasted great. I'd love to come back and eat here again.  Price was great too for what you get."}
{"text":"I'm really confused as to why people love this place so much. There is nothing special to be found here. I went here with a large group and not one person at our table was happy with there food. I had the chicken salad platter that was bogged down with so much Mayonnaise that was all you could taste. The server was friendly enough but needs some polishing. When serving a table you serve each person and not just stand at the end of the table auctioning off food and asking the other people to pass the plate along.... lazy. I had tried this place once before in the past and wasn't impressed so when invited out to dinner with this group I figured I give it another try and still fell short. If your into subpar service and fast food style bbq then this may be your place otherwise keep driving."}
{"text":"Simple little barbeque place with friendly staff and wonderful food. The grilled chicken sandwich is a personal favorite of mine."}
{"text":"This was a random stop for us on our way from Maryland to Georgia, and what a great find it was! Delicious pork, great coleslaw, good beans, pretty reasonable pricing. They do take-out or dine-in. The service is friendly too."}
{"text":"Had to pick  to go today for lunch, great Que as usual from R&R.  Small tray is plenty of food.  BBQ, slaw, and hush puppies.  Fast service!  Thanks."}
{"text":"A great place for delicious comfort food in a cute slightly-themed restaurant.

Seat yourself when you get in, and don't forget to look up and check out the two train tracks with trains actually running on them!  Ok, you probably want to know about the food - fresh, hot, and reasonably priced.  BBQ is definitely good, with a choice of sauces at the tables.  Tonight we got the grilled chicken plate and it was delicious!  I don't know what they marinate it in, but the chicken breast is always juicy and seasoned perfectly!  Green beans nicely seasoned (and NOT sweet - don't know why some other places do that!), and a side salad that was just the right size.

My second favorite is their chicken salad sandwich.  Two big scoops of chicken salad on toast with a slice of Swiss cheese.  Yum!  Burgers and fries are great here too."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great food and great service without the glam this is a perfect spot. Never disappointed. Always get the banana pudding."}
{"text":"Growing up on the east coast one thing I loved to eat was Carolina Barbecue, but unfortunately it is hard to find in Texas, where I now live. Each trip back east that I take, Carolina Barbecue is a must. This particular trip we opted for R&R Barbecue. It was a good choice! The cole slaw came out on the side, so I promptly dumped it on my sandwich and added the vinegar sauce to the otherwise dry sandwich. (Vinegar and tomato-vinegar sauces are kept on the table.) My husband ordered the large sandwich with small fries and the waitress misunderstood and brought him a small sandwich and large fries. She exchanged the sandwich, and changed the ticket to a large sandwich, but didn't offer for us to pay for the small fry. Overall good experience, and glad to get my fix!"}
{"text":"Here in Charlotte to see the NHRA 4 wide nationals at Zmax Dragway. Decided that since we were in North Carolina we gotta try some Carolina BBQ. Found R&R thru the Yelp app. Asked one of the volunteers at the track if she knew of it, she said she had just been there 2 hours before and it was awesome!  

So, My son and I checked it out - we sat right away and the food arrived amazingly quick. 

We both had a combo platter with pulled pork and baby back ribs, fries, and mac n cheese. It was amazing. The pulled pork was moist and tender and ribs were falling off the bone. The Mac n Cheese was really tasty! 

Our server was really friendly and the overall service was great!  If you're ever in Charlotte, you gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. They have very good Eastern NC style pulled pork with a vinegar base. They also have a delicious Brisket. The mac and cheese is great as well as the fries and the hush puppies. I've eaten here several times, and it's been a good experience every time. Next time i'm in Concord I will be going back."}
{"text":"Get the baby back ribs! Killer mashed potatoes!!! Quick service and excellent prices."}
{"text":"I usually dine at R&R on weekday evenings, looking for a quick, hassle free meal at a reasonable price.

The first time I went to R&R I remember thinking it was better than your average BBQ place in the Charlotte area.  However, the more I go to R&R's the less I like the place.

With that being said, the pulled pork is about what you would expect to get from a typical eastern North Carolina BBQ restaurant.  I usually run the regular Conductor's BBQ sandwich, which always hits the spot if you are looking for something quick, simple and cheap.  The most recent time I went to R&R, I ordered the baby-back ribs and was somewhat disappointed.  They were a bit tough and felt as though they had been sitting around for a while (see pics).  They were anything BUT \"fall-off-the-bone\".  

The sides also leave something to be desired.  I swear, their mac-n-cheese is nothing more than the boxed, microwavable, Kraft mac-n-cheese you can get at any grocery store.  I've had it enough times as a kid to know Kraft mac-n-cheese when its put in front of me!  The slaw is excellent in my opinion.  But the green beans and the baked beans, both of which I've had, taste like they are straight from a can (see pics); with little to no extra spices or seasoning.

I appreciate how there is always plenty of BBQ sauces at each and every table to satisfy any sauce-lover.  

The service is ALWAYS exceptional.  Every time I go to R&R's, I am greeted by a friendly wait staff that allows me to seat myself where ever I'd like.  My order is always taken quickly and promptly and they have never messed up my order.  

All in all, I think R&R has the necessary ingredients (nice facility, parking, reasonable prices, great staff, location, decent food) to become a standard setter when it comes to BBQ in the Charlotte area.  However, when it comes to properly mixing and cooking those ingredients into a smorgasbord of BBQ delight, the final result is a little undercooked."}
{"text":"I like this place because it is one of the few places in Concord that's not a national chain. Simple food, good food, nothing fancy and reasonable prices. Usually see good crowds there breakfast and dinner. They are unfortunately closed on Sundays, otherwise they would probably have my business more often."}
{"text":"Good food and matching service. Great restaurant for some good down home BBQ and the kids will love watching the train running over head."}
{"text":"I may be slightly biased but I love bbq and I've been to many establishments, and R&R is right there at the top.  Bbq is great but go on Friday for some of the best brisket you'll ever eat.  Baby back ribs fall off the bone and fried corn on the cob is a must.  Don't forget to save room for banana pudding - it's delish and homemade every day."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! R and r is one of the best places to grab bbq and its usually very quick. The train is forever stuck in my memory."}
{"text":"Our meal wasn't memorable but the service was excellent! 
We both had the pork BBQ , mac and cheese (was okay), green beans (canned) and beans (so so)
Brunswick Stew which was bland. Chicken wings were dynamite.
Our server was pleasant, efficient and attentive."}
{"text":"Yesterday R&R did the catering for a \"Thank You\" event from the higher ups for the group I work in @ Wach/WF.  Never one to turn down a free meal I went to check it out.  They provided a choice of chicken or pork, baked beans and red or white cole slaw and some potato chips.  They also has sweet or unsweet tea and bottled water.  

I went with the pork, white slaw, beans and chips, and they gave everyone a plain hamburger roll to build a sandwich, if one desired.  The slaw was actually really good, the beans tasted okay, maybe a bit sweeter than I like, the pork was okay but really dry.  That is partially my fault, in my rush to move along out of the buffet line I forgot to add any bbq sauce, so it probably would have helped out a bit.  I am not a fan of freshly brewed teas so I skipped and went w/bottled water, but co-workers seemed to enjoy it.  They also enjoyed making fun of me for being a Yankee and not enjoying sweet tea, but that's neither here nor there!

Overall the staff I encountered, not sure if they actually work at R & R, were friendly and you could definitely have gone for 2nds if you wanted.  They also had a shaved ice truck, but I don't know if that was part of R &R either, but I definitely enjoyed that too!!"}
{"text":"I have only been here for breakfast and it is quick and really good.  A great local joint to support your local restaurants.  Great breakfast!"}
{"text":"I reviewed it in tips by mistake but have to say it again food is great and prices are even better! Hush puppies, Brunswick Stew, the BBQ, and sweet tea. Will be back every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"If I had rated this restaurant the last few times I was there, I would have given it 4.5 stars.  Unfortunately, after tonight's visit, I won't be back. 

Apparently, they've cut corners by buying MUCH cheaper chicken tenders...and those tenders used to be so AWESOME, now they look like the ones I pour out of the freezer bag at home.  The hamburger used to be great, now it's thinner than McDonald's.  They used to have the best baked potato EVER, now it's just ordinary.  The water tasted like chlorine; maybe that's why the waitress put lemon in it without asking?  Service has always been spotty; took a LONG time tonight to get our order taken.  

In the past we've driven over 1/2 hour to get there (especially for those fantastic chicken tenders!); I'm sad to say we won't be returning.  But I'll give them two stars instead of one for the delicious meals we've had there in the past."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ at very reasonable prices. We've been here a few times, most recently with our two younger granddaughters. There are a couple of sauces on the table to add to the NC style BBQ, and they're good. The BBQ servings are very ample and it's pretty tender and nicely cooked. There are kid's meal options and a number of sides to choose from. We've had a number of them and they're all OK, albeit nothing that particularly stands out.

Servers are polite and the food generally arrives very quickly. The motif is neat inside, with a couple of trains suspended above the dining area - one of which was actively working. That certainly helps keep the kids entertained, but the food comes out quickly anyway. They do provide coloring materials for the kids - a nice touch, and there is lots of parking available. 

Overall it's good and if you want a quick bit to eat, it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"Love R&R BBQ!  The food is fantastic!  Great pork BBQ; Friday Brisket is wonderful; and the banana pudding...WOW!  The ladies on the wait staff are so super - everyone seems to really enjoy working there.  This place has a large number of regulars (known by name and have their usual tables) which is testimony to the outstanding food & service!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Service was a little inconsistent but good fried corn on the cob and mac and cheese."}
{"text":"This place has the best barbeque that I had had in a long time the people that work there are so very nice and helpful .we would recommend R&R to everyone"}
{"text":"Listen, I travel, I eat.  I know food.  Mac n cheese, pork, okra, hush puppies.  These were all delicious.  But folks, we ain't here to talk about that.  We are here to discuss banana pudding.  My mother is from Arkansas, that woman makes the best dang banana pudding of all time.  I had to call and apologize to her after eating the banana pudding here.  It was so good, that I wanted to keep eating.  Like I would get a second stomach if possible so that I could eat more.  Nuff Said"}
{"text":"Fa-get it!!! Grease pit.... for breakfast, lunch and dinner!! Sell that one too, maybe another greek restaurant owner will buy it!!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the BEST barbecue my wife and I have ever enjoyed! The service was outstanding, Our server was fast,  knowledgeable, and very very nice. Saved room for dessert, and happy we did! Banana pudding and Coconut Cream pie were fantastic! We don't make it down this way very often, but, future trips will involve a visit to our new favorite BBQ place!"}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews for places but this just plain wasn't good.  At all.  The pulled pork had no flavor except for tasting kind of old, the BBQ was dried out, and the sauce was basically just vinegar.  I just dropped nearly $20 on an essentially inedible meal.  Sorry to say it, but I wouldn't ever come back."}
{"text":"The best barbecue around at great prices! You won't find ribs or brisket in the menu, but the big BBQ sandwich is hard to beat! A hidden hometown favorite!"}
{"text":"Got the Engineer plate with beans and slaw with an added bun and it was very good!  Will certainly visit again when I am in the area!  Good BBQ, service, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick dinner.  They have vinegar based BBQ with good portions for a plate.   Good place for family dining"}
{"text":"Was in town for a wedding near Concord and we got take out from this place the day before the wedding. It was UNNNNNBELIEVABLE. If Southern people know how to do one thing, it is food. I lived in North Carolina for 4 years and I miss Carolina bbq so much, and this may have been one of the best bbq places I have ever had. Even the next morning heated up for leftovers, the food was incredible. 

Pulled pork was out of this world good -- you can get a more tomato-based sauce or the more vinegar-based sauce (more typical of Western Carolina). I combined both of them and added a dash of hot sauce and it was like a flavor explosion in my mouth. God. I could eat this for every single meal.

Baked beans - perfection. Great sauce, great flavor, great texture, perfectly cooked. Couldn't ask for anything better.

Cole slaw - I don't even like cole slaw but I absolutely loved this coleslaw! Couldn't get enough. It's mayo-based but at the same time light. Mmm mmmm mmmmmmmmm.

Hush puppies - big balls of fried dough. Amazing.

Fried okra - Also amazing. Perfectly fried.

Mac and cheese - Good. Made with real cheese. 

My only regret is that I was not able to try the fried corn!!!!!!!! Also that I do not have four stomachs so that I could not just continuously eat this all day every day.


R & R BBQ, if you are reading this, I would love you FOREVER AND EVER if you opened up a location down in Tampa, FL! (Okay I will still love you forever even if you don't and if I am ever back in Concord I am coming here for every one of my meals.)"}
{"text":"Tried R&R on a Saturday for breakfast. We had about 6 in our party and waited about an hour for BREAKFAST FOOD! The place was moderately busy but clearly not slammed. The food was inferior to most other breakfast places in the area as well. Such a waste of time!"}
{"text":"I came here because I wanted to try a local BBQ spot which was not a chain restaurant since I am visiting from Brooklyn, NY. So I heard about this place. I had the BBQ and the half rack baby back ribs. The portions were big and it was tasty. It was my first time having the Brunswick stew it was good. The Mac and cheese was good not great. The hush puppies were good. Fried okra good. Next time really want to try the fried corn on a Cobb and the BBQ cole slaw it sounds good. The prices are decent I paid $21.00 for 2 dinner plates which came with 2 sides and 3 hush puppies or rolls, not bad."}
{"text":"This place is great!! For an outstanding BBQ Pork Sandwich....you gotta try it and my personal favorite is the fried corn on the cob. The place is always crowded, but not over crowded. The waitresses are extremely nice and very attentive. This place gets five stars from me!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Ribs are the best.  The attention is grate. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a Mid-South guy from Arkansas who loves BBQ done Memphis style.  I like Memphis style tomato base sauces with my pulled pork and my ribs with dry rub.  I can take my ribs wet but prefer dry.   Rating BBQ is like rating religious denominations.  You are not going to win that argument.  

I enjoyed R & R.  They have different sauces at the table to select from (tomato and vinegar).  Pick the one you want.  Pulled pork was good.  The ribs were decent.  Sweet tea was great.  I enjoyed their hushpuppies, which by the way were round like they are suppose to be, and not those dog turd looking hushpuppies you get at most BBQ joints around here.  You get the choice of mayo slaw or vinegar (red) slaw.  They got beer in the bottles if you want one.

Last thing is the desserts.  Highly recommend the banana pudding."}
{"text":"So so overall. We didn't do a lot of research before heading to this spot but on our trip to concord we were looking for some authentic NC bbq so we dropped in. The bbq was great and the service was good but all in all the meal as a whole was just ok. A bit of a let down was the famous fried corn. The corn was bland and weighed down with the grease it was fried in. Not good!"}
{"text":"Oh man!!! I am in love with this place! The best BBQ i've ever had! So worth going to over and over again. It's hidden in the back of Concord, but if you ask the locals, im sure you'll be able to find it. I believe it's family owned. 

So you walk in and you can seat yourself anywhere. They have boths or rows of tables. If you look up, there are train tracks with a little train on it. Not sure if it works, when we were there, it wasn't on. The menus are already at the table and it's pretty easy to read.

I ordered the Engineer platter (because I wanted the sides). Their \"rolls\" are hamburger buns. The pulled pork was OUT OF THIS WORLD! It didn't even have the BBQ sauce on it when I first took a bite. It was so juicy and full of flavor, oh man...it's making me want to go back for more just writing about it. They pile on the meat too, you won't walk out of here hungry! For my sides I got the mashed taters and pinto beans. I didn't care for either of them, so I'll try something different next time.

My friend got the ribs (small rack) with fried corn on the cob (yes, you read that right) and onion rings. She said the corn on the cob wasn't what she expected, but she ate it anyway (and for her, if she eats it, she likes it). She also said the onion rings were pretty good as well.

My husband got the pulled pork and chicken. He said the same thing about the pork as I did and couldn't stop raving about it. The chicken on the other hand, he said it was a little too salty. I don't remember what sides he got, but he was very satisfied with his meal. 

For dessert, my husband got the banana pudding which he wanted more of, my friend got the mudpie and it was AWESOME, and I got the death by chocolate cake which tasted like it sat in the fridge too long.

If you're in the mood for BBQ, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork BBQ was delicious and tender and the hush puppies were some of the best we've had. I liked that they offered both a mayo and a vinegar (red) slaw because my husband prefers the mayo-based and I prefer the vinegar! The service was outstanding and as other reviewers have said, the sweet tea was perfect.

I'm not sure what one of the other reviewers was talking about when comparing the mac and cheese to Kraft's because it was definitely homemade. Be forewarned, though that the mac & cheese has got a spicy kick that was a little too spicy for my kids.

The mashed potatoes left a lot to be desired, but the fried corn on the cob was a real treat. 

Several people in our group tried the banana pudding and all agreed it was outstanding. 

We would definitely go back the next time we go to Concord."}
{"text":"Typical Southern BBQ joint.  Food is fast...not bad at all.  

If it's distinction and character you want, head to Smoke Pit or something in that vain."}
{"text":"This was a great find on my way to Winston-Salem, exactly what I was looking for; local, southern bbq. 

The waitresses were friendly and prompt, and the food was delicious. What more could one ask for?"}
{"text":"I was looking for a local place ( read as \"not a chain restaurant ) and this was recommended by the hotel clerk. Friendly and clean. People tended to sit together on long tables and socialized. Quite the southern type hospitality I thought!"}
{"text":"The first problem is the spelling.  Everyone who reads my reviews knows that I like a \"c\" in my 'cue.  But I'll let that slide, because at various places on their menu they spell it with a \"c\".  On the sign out front, however, they spell it with a \"q\".  They also spell it as \"bar-b-que\", so there's not a lot of consistency.  Still, it is being a bit picky, and I get that.

Once you're inside, you'll find a cozy, somewhat train-themed room, and at least some of the staff is very friendly.  The cashier, for instance, was about as nice as a post.  But the waitress could have been a family member, she was so nice.  It seems that the cashier was the oddity here, as the other servers were nice as well.

The menu contains a good selection of food, including one thing that I had never seen before in all my travels - fried corn on the cob.  In fact, they don't even have regular corn on the cob (though they do have corn off the cob).  We had to try it.  We also tried their ribs, a couple of plates of barbecue, a chicken sandwich, fries, onion rings, rolls (which are really buns) and some mac and cheese.

On the food, it was really hit and miss.  The fried corn was actually really good.  I'm not a huge fan of corn on the cob, but I was a fan of this, and I'd get it again.  Likewise, I don't generally like ribs, but I liked these - very tender, almost falling off the bone, and lots of meat.  The onion rings were good as well.  So I'd probably say order up some ribs (half rack might do you), fried corn on the cob and onion rings.

But their barbecue was so-so.  It's not that it was bad, it just wasn't great.  They provide a vinegar sauce and a thick sauce on the table, and both were okay, but neither really did a lot for the meat.  Both made acceptable sandwiches, but they did serve a lot for it.  I'd suggest skipping both the fries (a bit limp) and the mac and cheese (glop of cheese the congealed as it sat).

I also picked up a cream-filled cookie on the way out that I need to eat.  Where did I sit that?"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here. I had a small plate with red slaw and enjoyed it. They have great BBQ sauce. I also found out a love cherry wine! I think the best thing about this place though is the family vibe you get when you go in. Our waitress, Angela, has known my friend for years and I haven't felt so welcome in a restaurant. It was so nice to see how kind everyone was. It made the experience that much better!"}
{"text":"Y'all, this is GOOD barbecue.  Just about as good as you can buy!  Totally laid back, the kids love the trains running above the seating (and they are so awesome to have coloring pages available).  Fast and yummy-and totally budget-friendly."}
{"text":"We make a point of popping in at R and R when we are traveling through the area. The food is always good, and the prices are terrific.  They have a descent pulled pork sandwich, both the red and white slaws are good, and the hush puppies are great."}
{"text":"Schools, churches, and clubs all get their food from here when they have events. Not the best bbq I've had but it is really good. Pulled pork with vinegar sauce is my fav"}
{"text":"Okay I loved this place. 
Good BBQ is an art, and the have it mastered.

The Ribs were perfect fall of the bone. There homemade sauce is great.

Lot of good side choices.
The Mac and Cheese was not very good. very dry."}
{"text":"Nice people, friendly faces. 
 No woodpiles out back. Barbecue not very barbecue. 
Wish I had ordered fried \"baloney\". 
Hush puppies A+."}
{"text":"BBQ is my thang and sadly there are not any real BBQ joints in Concord. R&R is a decent BBQ alternative. Everyone who knows BBQ knows that BBQ smell from the wood used to smoke the meats. You want find that at any of these places in Concord...sadly.

R&R serves decent BBQ. Their red slaw is decent as is the Brunswick stew and hush puppies. Their desserts are much better than the 'que. Can't go wrong with the banana pudding or coconut creme pie.

Never had any bad experiences here, just wish for more smoke in the meats. Still a fan of R&R."}
{"text":"Had lunch catered in from R & R today for a business meeting. Meal was ready on time and the price was reasonable. The que was pretty good for western NC style bbq. The biggest hit of the meal was the banana pudding. I would go back."}
{"text":"Back again to R&R. This time for a pick up order. These guys know how to take care of their customers! A very nice person was outside, ready to either take our order or to go inside and pick it up for us. Of course the pulled pork and hush puppies were great. The red slaw tasted wonderful, not a fan of the texture, too fine a chop, but on the pulled pork sandwich it blended well."}
{"text":"Have eaten there many times and also done curbside pickup.  Food is always delicious and hot. Favorite BBQ in Concord"}
{"text":"We were visiting the Concord area, and we were looking for a locally? owned restaurant. We were told by two people about the R&R Bar-B-Que. This place is exactly what I was looking for, and the food was on point. If you're on I-85 around exit 52 you must stop in. Great job R&R."}
{"text":"They say you are what you eat....and I definitely eat like a pig every time I go to R&R!!!

This place is well worth the drive from Charlotte!  I wish there was one closer to us because the food is just that good!  The fried corn is amazeballs and the pulled pork is so buttery you end up drooling on yourself.  If you want a real treat, the ribs are the way to go.  Do yourself a favor and order the combination plate.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The bbq was is awesome and the service was great in this no frills restaraunt. Outside of the bbq, the onion rings were frozen not fresh made and the French fries had a ton of salt on them. The service was fast and the wait staff was super friendly, except for the cashier who wouldnt even look at us. They could also use some beer on tap and not just in bottles. It was great to find a non - chain place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good BBQ and generous portions.  No wait when I was there."}
{"text":"First, let me say as a native Charlottean that grew up eating at the 'Old Hickory House' on North Tryon Street my opinion about BBQ may differ quite a bit than yours. The 'OHH' was renowned for their open fire-pit fueled with real hardwood logs and the meats cooked tended to be heavily smoked with a heavy 'bark', or crust, that is only seen with an open fire-pit method of cooking.

Pellet or chip smokers like the type used in most modern BBQ restaurants can't replicate this method of cooking meat, IF this is the type this restaurant uses. When I do BBQ at home I do it in the same manner, albeit on a much smaller scale.

So with that said, when I tried R&R today for the first time I found the flavor of the pork and chicken (I tried both) a little bland for my taste. For sides I had their Brunswick stew and baked beans and again found both a little too pedestrian for me. A good shake from the Texas Pete bottle saw to that problem! As a southerner that grew up eating many different versions of Brunswick stew a REALLY good one needs the smoke flavor from the meats used in it to enhance the overall flavor.

Please don't misunderstand this review and think I didn't enjoy it. On the contrary I found it quite good and overall satisfying. The overall quantity and quality of the food was as expected. Service was good, even though it was lunch time and they were a little busy. 

Some people may not like meats as heavily smoked as I do so you may like this style of BBQ. Give it a try and judge for yourself!"}
{"text":"One of our hometown favorites!  Our kids love the trains!  The food is slap yo Mama, homecookin' good and the prices are fair.  They also do a fantastic catering package.  We did it for 25 amd they made it so easy by supplying EVERYTHING you need."}
