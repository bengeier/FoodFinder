{"text":"We just had a family last weekend at this place and we will never go there again.  The owner, she was very rude and doesn't appreciate her customers.  We had 70 guests and first the place was cold all night at (16 degrees) and the table clothes all had stains on them.  The DID NOT have enough food for our guest, which was emabassing. She told me she made food for 80 people and we only had 64 guest including all the children and she ran out of food? She told us that she doesn't need our business?? Really?? Who says that to their customers?  We will not go to a place that doesn't need customers... Horrible service and very rude owner (lady)  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place did not have a Yelp page! In the interest of preserving this place, and by extension my very existence, I have taken it upon myself to announce this little gem to the world. I have never before tried Afghan food. Ever. But let me tell you...this place has turned me into the ultimate fan of Afghan cuisine! They have a buffet open everyday except Mondays with the most delicious Afghan dishes imaginable. Both my boyfriend and I literally get cravings in the middle of the night for their soft meatballs (kobideh) bathed in tomato sauce. The also have chicken, kebabs, different selections of rice, various beans and vegetables, a salad bar and sweets station, complete with a fruit selection. Also, if you are there, absolutely DO NOT leave without trying the most amazing soft dumplings filled with ground beef, onions, peas, and corn (called mantu I believe), they are to die for! I absolutely do not remember life before this place. Try it. Any other buffet after this will seem like a swill factory. I hate fast food, and this place tastes super home-made, healthy, and filling. Did I mention that it was only $8.99 per person?! That price cannot be beat, especially if you're a starving student such as myself :) The only downside is that the buffet is open only from 11:30 - 3:30 pm, which makes me have to rush there from class if I really need lunch from there that day, I wish it stayed open a little longer. However, they also provide take-out, and the place offers a proper sit down restaurant area as well. They also do catering and events I believe. Bottom line: BEST. FOOD. EVER!"}
