{"text":"I've eaten lunch there four or five times in the past year.  But, this last time was embarassing!  I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and fries with a diet pepsi for $6.00.  After I had eaten my meal, I asked if I could pay with a credit card.  The waitress who didn't have access to a credit card reading machine said no.  I only had $4.00 in my pocket.  What was I to do?  The waitress said to give her the rest next time I came in and handed me the bill.  I'll pay the entire bill over again next time when I go to Recovery Resources  down the street.  Very friendly policy!"}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time today. I had the chicken salad sandwich and fries and my friend had the veggie scramble. I also got a Greek salad to go and it looks delish. Everything was good except the fries were pretty oily and not crispy. But it's super affordable and cute inside and the server was really nice. I'll for sure go back but probably won't have the fries."}
{"text":"Fabulous hospitality, consistently good food, and a welcoming vibe makes this place my must visit."}
