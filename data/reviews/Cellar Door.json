{"text":"The first time we went to this restaurant we had just returned from a trip to Italy, where as we know, the pizza is as good as it gets.  We thought it was a bit risky to order pizza and be disappointed but instead we were delighted by how delicious it was.  The crust was crisp, the toppings fresh and tasty and the size was generous.  We have been there several times since and always look forward to the next."}
{"text":"Best wood oven pizza in town :-) The octopus salad is great as well and the staff is very friendly. Try the homemade pasta too!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here last night. The caprese salad with burrata was fresh and the cheese was so creamy. The grilled octopus was my favourite, tender with the perfect amount of char and a flavourful  romesco sauce. The wood oven pizza has a great crust, crispy and light. The gnocchi was fluffy with a rich mushroom sauce.  Service was friendly and attentive. A great environment and place to sit eat and relax!"}
{"text":"Nice room, (if a bit noisy); nice staff. Pizzas are good, and a good value - you could share one, with some wine, and come out quite happy.   Had pasta dish with lamb. Only okay; kind of bland.   Nice place, but not one I would rave over. But it was full, so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Live in Mimico and a friend mentioned I should try out the Pizza. It was delicious and the staff was friendly. I have ordered takeout a few times since and will definitely go back soon. Recommend the RHCP pizza and tagliatelle."}
{"text":"A great addition to New Toronto. I've been here a few times now and the food & service has always been exceptional. I highly recommend you try it out."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place a 3, although it very easily could have been a 4  or more with some improvements.  I have had two experiences eating here so far.  The first was a couple of months ago, a friend booked a birthday dinner with a set menu for about 15 people.  There were several courses including a charcuterie board, salad, pasta and pizza for 50 dollars per person.  Each course was generous in serving size and I was really impressed especially with the pizza and the pasta.  This good experience really made me want to come back in the future.  I came again last Friday with my boyfriend, father and his girlfriend.  We came at 7:45 with reservations and the restaurant was extremely busy. It stayed very busy and loud for the rest of the night.  It was the night before Halloween and there was one table hosting a Halloween party and a couple other tables full with large groups of people, so it may possibly have been more full than usual.  We ordered the charcuterie board and a salad to share to start.  Charcuterie board was good, my only suggestion would be that they add some more of the only cheese on the board (a very good ricotta) or add a couple different options of cheese as well.  The toasted bread that came with the charcuterie board was excellent.    I ordered the 45 day aged steak and ordered it *very* rare, my dad's gf ordered the same medium rare.  My father ordered spaghetti and a pizza with salami, mushrooms and requested anchovies on his, and my bf ordered spaghetti as well and a margerita pizza with prosciutto on top.The wait for our mains was long.  Again, it was an extremely busy night so that was probably part of it, these things happen in the restaurant business so it's understandable.    The steaks came with a side of shoestring french fries and a nice little salad in a small side pot.  The cut of steak was very nice, although the steak I requested as *very* rare definately came out as a medium rare.  My dad's gf's steak which was ordered a medium rare came out a medium.  We both agreed the steaks were good, just overcooked to our liking.  Now, I find this is a problem in the vast majority of restaurants you eat at in Toronto....they always overcook your steak!! I think I will now have to start requesting it Blue to get a nice rare.  Probably people complain about \"raw steak, oh the horror\" so most restaurants are overcooking it now to be safe...except a few best steakhouses in Toronto...but anyways....  My father's pizza came without the anchovies he requested.  I think this is because the waitress took all of our orders including appetizers at once, not writing anything down.  My father did not complain, but it probably would have been more helpful to her on such a busy night to have written the orders down!  Overall, my father and bf were happy with their pizzas and pasta.  I think this place does a very nice crust.  When it came to dessert, they do not have a dessert menu.  The waitress said this is because all the desserts are made in house and that the menu changes according to what they have.  My father and his gf both ordered gelato and I ordered the \"deconstructed cannoli cheesecake\".  My father and bf both ordered an espresso.  The desserts were slightly dissapointing.  There could be more improvement here.  My father and his gf's gelato was just one scoop, slightly small.  Most restaurants will give you two or three scoops so this could have been improved.  I was also undewhelmed by my dessert, which again, I thought was rather small.  The deconstructed cannoli was just 3 small squares of filling on some crumbles or a cannoli shell with some pistachio on top.  I would have rather just had a cannoli! Or the serving size could have been improved.  Again, the waitress forgot my dad's espresso...he didn't say anything, but at least he was not  charged for it.  So overall, our second experience was ok.  Improvements could be made in the service, desserts, and how they are cooking the steaks.  It was also a quite loud so I would not come here for a date on a Friday night.  They seem to be doing very well and I would not rule out coming again in the future, maybe not on a Friday though."}
{"text":"This area is really becoming known for good dining options. Full disclosure our friends nephew works here.  The Caprese salad was exceptional.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was ok.  A little richer Bolognese can be had but it was good.  The Margharita pizza I sampled was good. The wood fired oven ensured a terrific crust.   Service was attentive and the prices (with the exception of the house wines) were good.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is real deal. The pizza is fantastic. The food is a bit pricey, but the food is so good u don't feel ripped off. We need a lot more restaurants that look, and taste like this one. The services was great as well go here. U won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time with the girls. Very happy we were all up to try a new place!  It was busy, but made resos via email the day before (Quick response too!) Atmosphere was very cozy. Great for date night or for family dinner. I had the Rosa pizza - So good! Thin, crisp, great toppings and the cheese was on point. Service was great. Everyone was lovely.  Happy to have a great Italian joint so close to home. Don't think I'll be going to Terroni as often... That's how pleased I was with the pizza :)"}
{"text":"The food was very good but the service not so much. Since we like to support local establishments we decided to try the Cellar Door based on some decent reviews. I have to say they need some more experienced servers/hosts . Although the restaurant was only 3/4 full on a Saturday night the atmosphere could be described as sort of laid back scrambly. Very disorganized floor staff. We waited about 15 minutes before anyone even looked at us. As soon as they did we were seated at a half set table. Our server was decent- fairly attentive and quick as opposed to the others we saw. Our food came quickly and it was really quite good.  Arugula beet salad was simple yet amazing. Will get it again.   The pizza had a super thin crust and it was superbly put together. It was better than anything offered in the area- including FBI and Even Dino's .   The gnocchi would have been excellent with more (some) sauce and without the roasted sweet potatoes that were basically chewy pieces of blech.....   The homemade bread which came halfway through the meal was also very good but too late.   I will go back because the food makes up for the poor service plus maybe they will have new floor staff next time."}
{"text":"Great pizza and restaurant, but either do take-out properly or don't do take-out at all. We waited over an hour for pizzas that we were told would take 20 mins. There was a lot on confusion surrounding the order. Hope to have a smoother experience in the future."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in south Etobicoke! We love it here, and eat here often. Their homemade pasta and pizza dough is spectacular! Next to my Italian Nonna, this place makes my favourite Italian food! Eat here!"}
{"text":"My favourite neighbourhood place for dinner....great atmosphere and amazing food, wood oven pizza, pasta and mains are all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem in New Toronto serving up old and new classics :). We love the seasonal changes to the menu. My absolute fave is the pasta carbonara, which is as good, if not better than the ones I've had in Italy.  While the pastas and pizzas are always great, the apps are where the chef's creativity really shines."}
{"text":"I went with my wife and 2 other couples. Had read a really positive blogto review and it's fairly close to us so thought we would try it. First impression was good - our server (Zack) was fun and personable. We went on a Saturday night and had a 6:30 PM reservation. When we got there, it was crowded and the atmosphere was nice. The decor in the restaurant including all the local photography is a nice touch. Overall, the food was good. More hits than misses. The octopus appetizer had good grill taste and the scallop special was nice. The pizzas were decent. The pasta was definitely the best part! My wife had the braised pork shoulder pappardelle and it was delicious and a huge portion. I had the pasta special - a rapini pesto with homemade Italian sausage. It was delicious too but I wish my portion was as big as the pappardelle. The not so great part of the meal was the end. It literally took us over an hour after we finished to pay and leave. They were so slow coming to finish us up and give us our bill. I think they were short staffed or something. And then they only had 2 working credit card machine. Anyway, it wasn't s great way to end. I'll try it again but hope the service is better."}
{"text":"Great pizza, pasta, service and the owners both had smiles on as they mingled with the crowd. This place is authentic in so many ways and is the perfect mix of nice but not too nice. Service was great and that was a concern based on other reviews so when it was great that was refreshing. Food was equally good."}
{"text":"Well, let me say this...love the atmosphere, minus the music. But we are not here to listen to music, arent we? I actually came to celebrate my boyfriend birthday....we got beet arugula salad- must say very good, presentation and taste 10/10:)...then we decided to get pizza, with bacon, as bacon is the way to go. It was good...wish the dough wasnt kind of wet-ish in a middle. Overall 7/10...the only thing i did not enjoy is the attitude of the staff...head down not so up:)"}
{"text":"It was alright.. I went here for a birthday celebration based on the reviews. Pizza was good but their actual entrées need work. Both the white fish and gnocchi were over cooked. 3-4 fold markup on the wines which is disappointing."}
{"text":"Food's pretty good, but the dining room is a little dirty and threadbare. Staff and owner were quite disorganized and occasionally rude.  Their attitude is a bit like: \"since we're a pretty popular restaurant, you should feel privileged to be eating here.\"  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, great service! A very popular restaurant (read: loud in there during peak hours) that feels a lot like a downtown Toronto resto :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here often and can confidently say this place is a true gem in New Toronto. The Pizza is, without a doubt, the best in the city. Service is always great and it has such a great vibe. I recently hosted a private party of 65 people there and was so happy with everything. Must try on the menu: the octopus, the vincenzo pizza, pesto tagliatelle, and (most definitely) the steak."}
{"text":"Discovered this place by accident while trying to find another Italian restaurant in the area.  Saw the great reviews and decided we should check it out.   Like:  The pizza!  It was delicious and very well made.  We also really liked the caesar salad, though I will mention it's fairly garlicky.  Prices as well are reasonable.  Dislike:  The service.  Sat for about 15 minutes before asking someone to come take our order.  They apologized, however we seemed to have a group of people serving us and no real rapport with anyone.  People that sat after us ended up eating and leaving before we even finished our food, and it took forever to get the bill.  Also, we both found the pasta dish bland.  I was really excited for this great find after stumbling across it but I'm uncertain if I would come back.  I don't live in the area and it's definitely not a place that I would drive out of my way for, though I understand why people like it so much.  I think we just had an 'off' experience."}
{"text":"Classy king west style restaurant on the lakeshore.  The gnocchi is awesome. The gluten free pasta option is boring but at least they offer the option."}
{"text":"This is our second time at this restaurant in 5 months....and I have to say....AMAZING!!!!  Our server was very attentive and pleasant to have Our food was so fresh and had unbelievable flavour!!! Wished we lived closer to make this our go to restaurant but it will always be on our list when we visit toronto. BRAVO!!! to the chef and staff!!!"}
{"text":"2.5 I was hoping for a better experience. The atmosphere is hip, but too loud. There seemed to be a lot of kids there, which certainly didn't help. It's not huge, the tables are close together and too many young families for me.  Also found the portion size small, not fancy-small, like it looked lunch size, but at dinner and dinner prices. The cream sauce was almost pasty it was so thick. At least because the portion was small I didn't waste very much. IF I go back I'd stick with a Margherita Pizza."}
{"text":"Nice Italian spot with welcome vibe and lots of action. Pasta is made fresh and decent wine selection."}
{"text":"I went to the Cellar Door for their special NYE dinner complete with 10 delicious courses and an absolutely awesome atmosphere! The chef, Rob, is a true perfectionist and it shows in the execution of the dishes and his creativity. The staff are also fantastic and it feels like one big family. This restaurant is definitely the hidden gem of this neighborhood, with a beautiful space, food, and experience. A must try!"}
{"text":"This place saved the Lakeshore for me. I've been waiting for a great restaurant to open down here for 10 years, and now hopefully the rest will follow. Fresh, light, pasta, some of the best seafood I've ever had...excellent pizza, good beer on tap, all served in a comfortable, contemporary atmosphere (with proper lighting) Can't reccomend Cellar Door enough!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. The pizzas in particular are amazing and that huge italian wood-fired oven at the back is a thing of beauty. I've had pizza at libretto and QMP and would take cellar door's margherita over those two places' any day. Decor could use some updating...it's overly stark and lacks warmth. Sound really bounces off the walls too."}
{"text":"The problem with an $18 medium sized pizza; kind of leaves you done after a single 'visit'. The interior is pretty busy, similar to other reviews; the speed is a bit slow. If a pizza of this size/ingredients was 12 bucks, multiple visits.  18 bucks for that experience doesn't create the 'return' factor."}
{"text":"After a long drive back from the US, I figured I needed some good food. There's really nothing appealing food wise in Buffalo (besides wings). Cellar Door is a small Italian spot in Etobicoke that specializes in Hand Made Pasta and Wood Burning Pizza.   Cute Space, Minimal Decor, and it's all about the food. I sat down at the bar, and ordered a Whiskey and Rye. It was very good, but can you really fuck up Whiskey and Rye? I then ordered the Bomba Pizza, Hand Cut Pappardelle, and the Braised Lamb and Beef Pasta.   First off I was beyond impressed by how fast the food came out, in a matter of minutes my pizza was the first to come out. The sauce on this pizza is incredible, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. The hot salami was so flavorful, the cheese was the perfect amount and there was some chili's in the sauce that gave it a great kick. I have to say I wouldn't come back here for the Pasta but I would 100% come back for the pizza.   The Pasta's were okay, you can definitely taste the difference with the fresh homemade pasta. The meats on both pasta's were a bit fatty and nothing to special. One of the pasta's was made using a very thick noodle which I wasn't a fan of.    Overall I enjoyed my experience here; and the pizza was phenomenal.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"I read a lot of positive Yelp reviews about Cellar Door so my friend and I decided to meet there for dinner on a Thursday night back in October.  I have to say that, other than the artwork and the pizza oven in the back, neither one of us were that impressed. I think what put me off from the beginning was that the server appeared very detached and seemed a bit put-off that we didn't order wine; albeit, we both were driving.  We both wanted appetizer salads but I recall that they only offered a beet and arugula salad and it was about $14. We decided to share the codfish fritters which had absolutely no seasoning and the cod to potato ratio was 35-65; it wasn't cheap either.  My friend ordered the Margherita pizza, which was severely burnt. I ordered the Bomba pizza, which was quite tasty but a little too burnt for my taste.  There was no regular coffee to enjoy after dinner and the server was lurking around so we kind of felt rushed and just got the cheque and left.   Very cold environment so, that being said, I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"We ordered the eggplant parm pizza - it was delicious!!! Cooked to perfection. Crispy but cooked through- not soggy and not burnt.  Friendly staff, great atmosphere. Will be back for more!  Update- can I say OBSESSED- ordered the potato pizza and margherita- still the best pizzas we've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Have only tried takeout so far but after hearing they were voted best pizza in Toronto and knowing it is just a few blocks from my house I had to try them out.   This area has a lot of good pizza places, and cellar door is no exception. Their pizza reminds me most of some of the pizza I had when I visited Naples, Italy.  I placed an order for takeout and they told me 10 minutes. Not even Domino's is that fast!  I had the Anna Maria ($16) and even though I had to drive it home in a box it was still fantastic. Can't wait to go back and eat at the restaurant as it looked very intimate and cozy, perfect for a date night.  If you like good Italian style pizza, definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times now.  As usual the food was excellent.  I had the fired artichoke, my wife had octopus.  Both were excellent.  The last time I came I ordered the octopus which was good but the portion was very small.  The one last night was much better and nicer presentation.  So I am not sure if it is change in the dish, different chef or just a different night, but keep it from last night!!  Our server was very good, but service was a little slow.  The restaurant was quite busy for a Wednesday but not packed.  They could have used more than one server or a bartender, as it seemed our server was also making drinks for the entire restaurant.  The pizzas are amazing!  I find the pasta dishes a little on the small side.  It certainly won't stop me from returning ..... but .... food for thought .... for Cellar Door management."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our 1 year anniversary last night.  We showed up for our reservations and we were pleasantly greeted with a \"Happy Anniversary\" from the staff.  Pizza is great, ambiance and decor were modern rustic.  Would go back for the pizza."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice and the first time we went the food was amazing but unfortunately the second time around we were very unimpressed. The food took over an hour to arrive, we had all ordered oven made pizzas. Understandably the restaurant was very busy but really the wait was too long for any pizzeria. Then to top it off there was a piece of hair wedged into the toppings of my pizza, when I told the waiter he took it away then within 2 minutes brought it back to me again asking me to point out the hair... it was as if he didn't really believe me. Through out the service he wasn't particularly friendly, quite cold to be honest so that comment didn't really help either. Thankfully he brought a new pizza to me pretty quickly, and the pizza was cooked deliciously apart from being slightly burnt around the edges. It's just a shame that the service isn't spectacular, the wait is far too long and there was a piece of hair in it too..."}
{"text":"A good new find in an area of West Toronto we are now spending more time in. Parking was easily found right outside the entrance early this as day night.  Margarita pizza, quickly prepared, was 3.5-4, beet and leafy green salad with dollops of yogurt was a 4.5. My gnocchi mains was a solid 4.   It is an interesting somewhat eclectic space that is still finding itself but rest assured we shall return because there are more dining options that were calling our names from the Cellar Door menu."}
{"text":"First time, no reservations on a Thurs night,  Great pizza, fabulous gnochi. Nice wait staff though we were abandoned a couple of times as he had a large table of about 16. Would have been nice if the wait staff who were not as busy had pitched in. Aside from that we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"To echo R.B.'s comments, I would say that Cellar Door is a solid 3.5 stars, but could easily be bumped up to 4 or even 4.5 with a few operational improvements.    Our waiter, Zach, was very attentive, charismatic, and super funny.  Thumbs up to him for making our experience great!  To start, the lot of us got a pizza, octopus, and scallops.  The pizza was phenomenal, the octopus had a nice grilled taste to it (and wasn't overly rubbery) and the scallops were tender and juicy.  The portions were small, but hey!  It's an appetizer!  For a main, I got the papparadelle with pork loin.  The pasta was perfectly al dente, but I would have probably reduced the amount of meat in the meal (there was more meat than pasta!) and added more salt (unless the restaurant is catering to a high blood pressure crowd.).    The cannoli cheesecake was delicious!  Great combo.  Small, but again, we were so full we were practically rolling out of the restaurant.  Not too much sugar in the cheesecake either.    Complaints: the mains took a LONG time to get to our table.  Between dessert and the bill, it took us an hour to get that transaction done, which was really strange.  (They seem to only have one credit card machine?)  Thankfully, we were in good company so that didn't matter so much, but I would recommend that Cellar Door 1) amp up the salt content slightly 2) get another card machine  3) figure out timing a bit better, 4) get more wait staff other than Zach (he seemed to be serving the entire restaurant!).  With these amendments, this place would be perfect!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Good service. Love the pizza variety there. Have dined in and take out. Not a fan of the pastas selection. Tried a couple and all werent to my liking."}
{"text":"We came in on a Thursday night and the restaurant has a lovely intimate ambience. We ordered the appetizer of the day which were white fish cake croquettes that were amazing. Following that we had the pasta with pesto and long roasted lamb that was one if the best dishes I have had in a long time as far as pasta dishes go. Along with that we ordered the four seasons pizza. Cool concept but toppings are better when they are mixed ."}
