{"text":"This joint is halal, it serves pizza, chicken wings, gyros and more.  This is conveniently located near a high school so expect students there after school.  The pricing of the food is good for students as it is inexpensive.  I also like the food."}
{"text":"I liked the pizza but it took over an hour and a half to get delivered so it was pretty cold. I suggest picking up the pizza yourself or ordering well before you actually want it. The prices are pretty great."}
{"text":"The best part about this place is its HALAL! :D I have not tried everything on the menu, however, the wings are really good. Pizza is not the best but not the worst either, surprisingly enough though the panzo's are awesome and are my favorite item on the menu. I have also tried the steak and cheese, and Chicken Parmesan sandwiches....they both taste better fresh so don't save them for lunch or later for that matter.   Also, if you are a clean freak, do not even dare go there after the lunch rush as the seating areas will be very dirty and the employee probably won't get to it until alot later. They need to step up on that aspect. But other than that I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Sandwiches keep getting worse every time I visit. I'm not sure if it's a change in management but the quality has seriously suffered in the recent months."}
{"text":"DON'T ORDER THE \"SHAWARMA\". what a disgrace, i paid $4.50 too. I also couldn't see how they make it too. That's what i get for going to a pizza joint got shawarma. These people need to google what is shawarma"}
{"text":"Small takeout pizza place across the Islamic Society of Markham. Hence, the place is a hot spot for Muslims and the place sells Halal food.  Almost strictly a takeout venue, Pizza 786 serves up sub-par pizza and most other things (wings, sandwiches, burgers, etc). The prices here are a bit cheaper than most of the other pizza places that are similiar in scope to this place. I ordered pizza and wings here for a football game and came away a bit disappointed.   The pepperoni and mushroom pizza I ordered was dry, and the cheese tasted as if it were microwaved onto the pizza. It was lacking sauce, but luckily it was seasoned fairly well. It tasted much better than it looked. The wings were average but were tiny. The sauce wasn't very good (buffalo), and the taste wasn't there as well.  I came here looking for cheap food, which is what I got, but I was hoping for better value and taste. I probably won't come back here again, but it is pretty cheap, for those looking to save a few bucks"}
{"text":"Nothing much to write here Nice take out place if u want late night fast food Highlights panzeroti n chicken wings  Dont like the spicy burgers though or the pizzas are rather underwhelming..."}
{"text":"This is an amazing Hot spot for Muslims , since there's a mosque across the street. Every Friday students from MCI high school come and eat after school, always Crowded. Serves halal pizza. Great place."}
