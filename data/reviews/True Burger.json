{"text":"Limited vegetarian options. Ordered Greek salad but it was sub-par and priced at a ridiculous (almost) thirteen dollars. Will be skipping this joint when traveling through this airport the next time."}
{"text":"One of the worst burgers I had in a while. I would take McDonald any day over this place. Meat smelled bad, overcooked, and tasted lime card board. Buns are horrible too."}
{"text":"Terrible. Waited in line for nearly 10 min, gluten free bun advertised on the menu. I get up to the counter and the girl tells me they don't have anything gluten free. I ask what their burgers are made of, she says 100% beef, so I ask how there could be gluten in them. She accuses me of having attitude and tells me there's nothing for me to eat and the gluten free bun is just on there by mistake. Disgusted by their behaviour and horrible service."}
{"text":"An hour line to order... Oh, don't get me wrong, this place is not packed at all, they are just slow."}
{"text":"This like an overpriced McDonalds, but very low quality, rude attendees and extremely slow serving."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm shocked that the woman and the guy behind the counter were allowed to work there unsupervised. It was the wild wild west when it came to making an order, they would take orders from people who chased them down to give them their order.  I watched a few people walk away because of this which I followed suit.   13 dollar burger that comes out of a warming oven and fries are were extra.  They did me a favor and went next door and got Tim Hortons.  Coffee, sandwich, soup and donut.  10$."}
{"text":"Cold bun, cold burger, for 20 bucks. Next time I'll just pick something out of the garbage and save myself from the rude service."}
{"text":"Rude,  slow,  misleading (once you pay you find out they're out of coke),  and serving people who sit at the bar out of order.... Worst burger ever,  and hopefully they'll give this prestigious  place to someone who wants to do an honest business."}
{"text":"Worst burger ever!  The previous poster who commented about the steamed beef patty wasn't kidding, it was just about the worst burger I've had, I'd rather have had eaten at McDonalds!"}
{"text":"Service no kind at all...sits unconfortable and the burger is not special...just meat with bread.without any piece of salad...the bartender blonde girl seems under LSD and she s slow also when you have to pay...do i have to loose my flight! Terrible! No way buddies! Right name is FAKE BURGER... Also in the meantime i was sitting there right and left customer near me complain about all..never seen a place like this"}
{"text":"I thought I would try out cheese bacon dog, tell me that does not sound awesome?!?!? Somehow they managed to wreck it, terrible."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for a burger combo.  The workers need to go through customer service training, and they need to get more staff in the kitchen."}
{"text":"In America these people wouldn't even be feeding the dogs. Disgusting, not to mention rude \"employees\", dirty tables and a 20 minute wait just because they have no clue how to run a FAST food joint. Seriously airport management, you award a food slot to these people?!? April fools every day at this place!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Quality is wildly inconsistent. Burgers are often overcooked since the person working the grill doesn't pay attention. They can't even figure out basics like where people ordering should wait vs those waiting for their food. Worst of all, the guy preparing the burgers with toppings was also touching raw meat, and he did not wash his hands in between. One star for being able to drink on the 'patio.'"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would....the fries were actually good, but the burger.....probably the worst burger I have ever had, or damn near close to the worse.  And the staff is not very helpful or friendly.  Eat somewhere else......wish I had."}
{"text":"Wish there was a -5 star, better off.. I wish I would have yelped this place before. I won't even feed my dogs with these burgers. Industrial meet, grey color and smelly. Don't blame it on the fact that it is airport food. If they cook the burgers while you wait, there is no reason to use frozen poor quality patties. Yuk"}
{"text":"I guess you really get what you expect when you go to a burger joint in an airport and order a double cheeseburger and poutine.  The problem was of the burgers taste like they have been done in the steamer and then really warmed up or just straight up cooked in the steamer. There was no char or flame flavor.  The poutine gravy was barely edible and the cheese was terrible.    You're better off saving your money and buying a package of beef jerky for the flight."}
{"text":"A decent burger joint. Not too many options but a tastey burger. Very pricey for what you get but its the airport!"}
{"text":"Worst burger ever. Worst service. Ordered burger with toppings. Received burger missing toppings but free hair included. Staff would not give anew burger or refund. Offered missing toppings in ketchup cups for self assembly. Do yourself a favor and don't come here."}
{"text":"Only full meal we could find near our gate. The burger is worse than McDonald's. They fool you with a bunch of toppings choices. And $1.50 to upgrade the combo to sweet potato fries when if you bought them separately they're only $1 more. Wtf?  Expensive for what you get, but it is an airport and not insanely priced."}
{"text":"The best frozen burger I have ever tasted. It minded me of the burgers I use to get at high school dinners and that just cost 1 pound ! They should have shot gun and ski mask cos there robbing Ba&@$/ ! The best thing was the fries and the staff where having a laugh ! I will not be going back here again even if it was free !"}
{"text":"For an airport location the service is very slow and disappointing.  The cashier was trying to take the order as fast as possible but the server was really lazy! They even got into an argument as one customer left without taking their order or something as you have to catch the flight.  Now I didn't have much time so I just got fries and Poutine as we were two people. the clock was ticking and the server lady was doing order by and waiting till the burgers were done for the other order... all she had to do is freaking put the fries in the bag and give it to us.   The cashier was nice enough and saw that I checked the watch couple of times and need my order so he went and made packed the stuff for and gave it to us. Because of the cashier they got 2 star or else this was a no star service for the high prices they charge on their menu.  The poutine was ok should have gotten sushi next door."}
{"text":"Burger was cold and dry. For $13 I should at least get hot food. I only forced myself to eat more than one bite because I had to get on a long flight. Even then I only took 4 bites. I recommend going to the Indian restaurant \"Marathi\" where they take more pride in their food. I just spent the last twenty minutes talking to this young American guy about his burnt hamburger. We are not happy right now. Oh and we had to wait a loooooong time to receive said crappy food, and this place isn't even busy."}
{"text":"Terrible dry card board burger, eggy/spongey bun..absolutely disgusting..the burger patty resembles the type of McDonalds burger that would get rejected from quality control ..  Never again"}
{"text":"Horrible food, overpriced, bad attitude service, understaffed, low quality food. Avoid."}
{"text":"I can only hope people get a chance to read the negative reviews of this place before they commit to waiting in the 1.5hr-long grueling line... (which doesn't include waiting time after ordering)  This place is simply not worth the super long lines. Apparently they believe that two thin patties make a burger a \"true\" one. It's about the equivalent of what you'd get at a fast food chain like Burger King but like quadruple the price. The only redeeming factor of this place is that you can customize and add whatever toppings you'd like on your burger, but that is also probably one of the (many) reasons why the line to order food takes SO LONG. If they had slips of paper to check off what you want on your burger and simply give it to the cashier, I think that would speed up the process. Also, there was only one cashier who was also prepping and calling out orders, and one chef. They were severely understaffed. Overall, not worth it, even if you are craving a burger -- might as well wait until you're at your final destination.  Random recommendation: don't get the dijon mustard on your burger, I think I teared up every few bites because they spread it so thick... my poor nose couldn't handle it. And obviously this comes from someone who normally loves dijon."}
{"text":"Bad food is forgivable, bad beer is forgivable but bad service on top of it all... this place is a total fail. There are plenty of options in the airport... skip this and eat out of a trashcan if you must. I can't promise much better food but at least the service will be better.  Top Tip: If you really want to try this place stand by the trashcan as many will be throwing away half eaten burgers..."}
{"text":"If yelp would let me, I would give zero stars. There was nothing positive about my experience here. Let's be honest the only reason I was here is because I had little choice. Two burgers two fries two beers, $60!  That's almost forgivable as we are at an airport. The problem is that the food is TERRIBLE!  The burger tastes like dry cardboard, it's chilled and was obviously microwaved or just warmed up and not cooked.  The service was slow. Lines around the corner and one person taking orders! We ordered a beer and the keg was not styled so it was just pure head. It took the cashier at least 2 min to pour a beer which does not sound bad except there are 15 people waiting in line!  After we got out \"food\" the bartender got in an altercation with a patron as there are certain seats that are for alcohol drinkers only, and even though there is 6 people for 25 seats, service was still refused without an alcohol order.  If you can please don't ever even look in the direction of this burger hell hole."}
{"text":"Not sure why there's such a low rating for this place... It was literally the cheapest option in all of Terminal 1. I got hashbrowns and a breakfast burger and was satisfied. Is it a meal I'll write home about?  No. But it was edible, fast (my order was completed in about 5 mins), and affordable. Everything else in that terminal was around $12/13 USD."}
{"text":"True burger Co serves the absolute worst burger I've ever had in my life. I think they microwaved the frozen patty a day before them kept in warm in a steaming tray for 15 hrs before flopping it on the grill for 30 seconds and giving it to me. It took 20 minutes for my girlfriend and my meal to come and cost $55. The meat didn't even taste like hamburger, it was closer to cat food. If you're smart enough to check Yelp before going to a place in the airport don't go here."}
{"text":"Worst burger I ever had to suffer through: while the price is more than enough for 2 Burger King combos, the quality is a lot worse- it actually feels like fresh out of microwave that the whole thing is very unevenly heated: some parts are warm, some are hot, and the buns are below room temperature...I guess I just became their target customer today: stranded at the airport due to delay/cancellation, too hungry and too exhausted to walk a bit further to notice there is a Tim Horton around the corner"}
{"text":"Not horrible, but not great.  The burgers on the grill looked so  juicy, but when i got mine, it was dry as hell.  Luckily, the was no line up when i got there but by the time i finished giving my order, it had gotten quite long.  The cashier looked miserable and nobody there seemed to knew how to smile (but that seems to be the trend with airport food places).  Next time, I'll try the pizza place"}
{"text":"Spending time in an airport isn't exactly fun. Lounges and restaurants can help but they're usually overpriced for what it is you actually get. Well on Friday I found myself in Pearson with two hours to kill before my flight and needed something to eat. There's really nothing of note as most of places sell the same things. Check it out if you don't believe me. For the most part they all sell the same things at the same prices. So enter True Burger.  What can I say that's positive about them? Not much. It will keep you from starving assuming you're able to choke it down. And that's really about it.  For the price I was paying, and from the name of the place, I was expecting some freshly ground burger that was expertly grilled and served with my choice of toppings. It was served with my choice of toppings so they got that part right. But they charge for just about everything including things like tomatoes and pickles which are typically free with any other burger. No here, you pay an extra $.25 cents per \"premium topping\". Never heard of tomatoes and pickles being premium, maybe they need to pass through a security checkpoint and are taxed differently once they get to the airport.  The thing that I got, that cost $12.00 I might add, was some rubbery thing on a bun that looked and tasted like it had taken a bath in salt water before being thrown in the microwave to get it lukewarm. I'm not kidding. There was a severe lack of grilling and the meat had a manufactured texture to it that had too much salt for my liking.   I literally couldn't finish it, it was that bad. Along with a bottle of beer it was about $22.00 which is disgusting for what you actually get.   I understand that the airport has fees and costs a bit more to get the products you might need but they're really sacrificing quality in their quest for bigger profits."}
{"text":"Decent place. I was sitting at the bar serving side not the take away. Good burger good cocktail. No limes though. Even if it was bad they are improving. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Do Not Eat here.  Don't, you'll regret it as we did.   I don't care how long the lines are, which might make you believe this is a good place, It's Not.   The food was horrible and somewhat expensive. If you must stand in a long line, then go to Tim Horton's right next door (see photo).  The burger was sooo over cooked I thought I was in the UK (Sorry)!  The foot long hot dog was unimaginable at best. Their bacon & cheese came with a folded piece of Velveeta and one slice of burnt bacon. Ugh!  Don't!    My stomach was regurgitating on our entire trip to Dublin, et cetera.  The old UK Wimpy was miles better than this place and that's saying something.   Yelp friends, don't let other Yelp friends eat here!"}
{"text":"Very pedestrian.  Had a footlong hot dog and it was very plain.  It felt like an Oscar Meyer weiner and really, for $6+tax, I want something that tastes at least like a Maple Leaf hot dog.    Should have gone to the Timmy's next door instead."}
{"text":"Awful and over priced chicken sandwich. Only thing preventing this from getting 1* is the fact that the poutine was not bad. I don't understand how they can mess up not adding ingredients to an order. Service was unfriendly. Skip this and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place certainly isn't great... or even that good... but to me it seems the vitriol has gone a bit far.  I had the chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, onions, mushrooms, pickles, jalapenos, dijon mustard, and a little sriracha. Total was $9 which - cmon! - is quite reasonable for airport food.  While their signage might imply fresh, the burgers/patties/chicken breasts are actually kept in a heating tray, similar to a fast food place. Still, my chicken patty was delivered hot and (pretty) crispy, so no complaints. The toppings are not super high quality - think Five Guys in the US (except the onions, which are barely grilled) - but again decent enough.   I will say the complaints about service seem spot on to me. When I walked up, there was one lady actually assembling the burgers... and no one else. She never once acknowledged me, and I waited a good 3-5 minutes before someone finally sauntered up to the cash register and deigned to take my order.  However, at the end of the day, I was still out in 15 minutes and my food was decent. For $9 at the airport, that's at least 3 stars for me."}
{"text":"after being delayed and missing my connecting flight I was very hungry, True Burger happened to be close to the terminal so I went there and had two Canadian beers both tasty, Fries were tasty, Burger was okay but not outstanding. Customer service was quick and friendly. Price was rather moderate I spent about $25.00CAD on everything but the burger was $13.00. Not great but not bad."}
{"text":"Zero stars. Over-priced, slow service, awful food. I couldn't tell which was colder, my burger or the employees working here. What a miserable experience."}
{"text":"Very weak burger.  Institutional grade meat, cooked nice and gray just like a school cafeteria. Poutine was passable.  Move along."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just paid $10 for that pathetic excuse for a plain burger. Save your money and go to A&W. I've had much better burgers at concessions. This is not by any means a gourmet burger experience. Buns were stale. My wife had to take her chicken burger back because it was cold. Fries were decent."}
{"text":"(3.5) ~ good overall food & service  MY MENU: ** Poutine = (4) very good * Burger = (3) ok"}
{"text":"I was hungry and not looking forward to my long flight. True Burger seemed like the best deal around. Unfortunately, I found their customer service and classic burger lacking.   Most time when I visit foreign countries, I and the service worker work hard to understand each other. I tried to ask about the size of their loaded poutine, but she didn't understand and wanted to sell it to me. I asked about their \"True\" Sauce and then she wanted to add it to my burger. Then I had to \"no\" a few times to making my meal a combo. She kept thinking my inquiries, framed with a question mark, were orders. Frustrating.  As for the burger, well, I had hoped my topping would add additional flavor. They were two relatively dry patties topped with localized choice toppings. It was bland and not even the barbecue sauce and jalapeno pepper (yep, only tasted one), could rescue this cow."}
{"text":"Worst service ever ! Very rude bar tender.  Burgers are not worth the price. Only decent food was sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"A sauce driven burger.  Loaded Poutine -- no complaints.  I was super happy and content.  How I miss the real Canadian Poutine.  Regular Burger -- two thin burger patties with no flavor of its own.  Need some sauce to be worthy of consumption.  The add-in is sparse that may be reduced to a few slices as you add more stuff.  Service -- not helpful, no suggestions and slow."}
{"text":"I should have checked the reviews but I got off a long fight and for some reason was craving a burger. Well needless to say the reviews are right.  This place basically just is serving McDonald's or bk burgers on a crappy bun. 16 bucks for a burger and fries would be happy to pay that if it was good  But good news is a walburgers is opening right across the hall. I've had there burgers in Dorchester when I lived down there and they weren't bad so hopefully there will be a better burger soon"}
{"text":"There's already a bunch of bad reviews on here...which I read before deciding to eat here. I have no one to blame but me. I'm going to bitch about it anyway though.   My fiancé wanted a burger before our long trip to Japan. We couldn't find any other place in this terminal in the E gate area for burgers. I thought to myself it can't be that bad, you can't expect much out of airport food anyway, that's partially why I'm going with a 2 star.   It was not a burger. It was cardboard. Definitely the worst burger I've put in my mouth. My fiancé gave me shit for wanting to order the \"skinny\" burger which is only one beef patty since two was only $2 more. I ended up taking the 2nd patty out and I made his ass finish it.   $30 for two burgers, one order of fries, and one soft drink. I saw some green apples for $2, shoulda bought 15 of those.  Oh and the service...well everyone behind the counter pretty much had a bitch face."}
{"text":"Saddest burger I've ever seen. At least I got my money back. The bun an patty were cold, one tiny slice of cheese. You are better off at Tim Horton's next door."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, refused to give extra packets of ketchup because \"you already have one in your bag.\" Needless to say we will not be returning anytime soon.   You do not give a customer attitude, you deal with theirs, I hope the extremely rude woman that took our order gets fired.   What is more frustrating is that after waiting in line for half an hour, they did not have any coca cola and they also got our order wrong.   It was definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is horrible,  I havent had a burger this bad in a long time.  The service was rude enough and the food is tasteless and quite pricey. I think the mushrooms came out of a can."}
{"text":"Should've read the reviews before. Hands down the worst cheeseburger I've ever had. So bad it made me feel bad enough to write my first yelp review!  Dry over-cooked tasteless meat, angry looking staff, and horrible bun. Not worth a cent."}
{"text":"Wish I'd seen the previous reviews. The burgers are mediocre at best. Mushy and not tasty. Ate a third and tossed the rest.  Service was alright :)"}
{"text":"Not that bad! Came here when I was looking for a decent burger. From the reviews below, I'd probably say avoid the beef and go with the chicken. I had the fried chicken breast and it was actually pretty good. Not 4 stars but not 3 stars, a fair rating would be a very solid 3.5 stars. Their Dijon mustard was top notch - my sinuses were cleared after eating that! Service was fast but the server didn't speak good English, had to try to decipher what she was saying. Anyways, they get an extra half star for whipping up that order like nobody's business. This place is located right next to the Tim Hortons in Terminal 1, near gate F66. Again, it's airport food, but it's a bit better than McDonlads. My only gripe is that it cost $12 for a chicken burger and bottle of water - what?! Oh well, if you're stuck here and starving and need a good burger, come here."}
{"text":"Ha I ate here before seeing the 1.5 star average  $16 for a meal with burger, fries, coke  Nothing tastes bad but nothing tastes that great either  Fries not so fresh Meat not tasty and juicy Cheese is cheap   I expected something like shake shack or five guys  Nope..  However this place will have a short line due to the poor value for money, so if you're in a rush go for it"}
{"text":"(Why can't I select 0 stars?!)   If it is possible to be more stressed out ordering a burger than being frisked by U.S customs, something is very wrong.   Let me save you some trouble. If you are wandering in Pearson airport in the near region of gate F66 and thinking of giving this place a try- DON'T.   No organization, no regard for time, no respect for patrons, no apparent management in effect, no-good burger, no way do you get my money again.   We were several people waiting to be served when they started closing up shop literally on us (their gate scraped my boot). Then we order and are treated to a show as we wait: staff fighting in plain sight. The main culprit was yelling incessantly at a cashier. She bore the name tag Satnam, but it might as well have read Satan (and the gate next door F666) as far as I'm concerned. Other staff members were putting away the drinks in the vending machine and putting up tables with people waiting to be served. And the grill- empty. We had to shout our orders (over the screaming Satnam) to finally get served. Mayhem.    Final verdict- burger tasted like crap and I was accidentally given someone else's stale fries (I know I didn't order them so... Someone is going hungry somewhere).  I RECOMMEND: walking past this train wreck, unless you are stopping by with a squat team to rescue the cashier getting abused in there.  Just. Don't. Do it. To. Yourself."}
{"text":"Service sucks Food is mediocre and both annoyed and annoying. Fries are good and poutine is fun for the airport. Beer is cold..."}
{"text":"OMG I need to puke now!!!  If you wanted to burn money come here.   If you wanted to figure out how cardboard taste like come here.   If you're depressed and want to know how a life ending experience feel like eat here.   For all other reason please stay away.  Thank you. Don't come again."}
{"text":"As I was signing the receipt with a tip the cashier was super rude and made a very rude comment. Then when I said I wanted to return the money I had to sit at a very dirty counter forever and wait for the manager... Egh... Gross... Then the manager couldn't give me the money back on my card so I had to take Canadian dollars."}
{"text":"Alright, maybe running out of Poutine was kind of a downer, but dude... their burger + mayo/ketchup/mustard + sauteed onions and mushroom + pickles (did I mention you can add whatever toppings you want?) with the 2 Ontario beef meat patties is AWESOME!  (Disclaimer, it might just be the tastiness of Canadian beef)  A bit pricey for a burger, but for the size, I was a happy high-flying-burger-eating-cat. Meow."}
{"text":"An excellent choice instead of an airport sandwich.  Built in with a Tim Horton's.   The burgers are cooked fresh while you wait with a wide-range of toppings.  I selected the cheeseburger with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles and mustard.  Other options include sauerkraut, jalapeños, Sirachi sauce, etc.  I thought the burger was delicious and priced OK since it's behind security in the airport.  The burgers come with fries (quite good) unless you specifically ask to exclude them.  With a soft drink and taxes, the burger and fries were about C$12."}
{"text":"Can I rate something 0 stars?  Just awful, and over priced - even for airport food.  Burgers were dry, tasteless, and felt like microwaved, boiled meat. The cheese was congealed, the lettuce limp, and the toppings wrong. Add in miserable service, a rude bartender, and music so loud you couldn't hear the person taking your order.  That may be one of the worst meals I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Took forever for my breakfast wrap, literally 20 mjns!!! WTH? The lady working the register was so rude, if she were my employee I would fire her IMMEDIATELY. She didn't even apologize for the long wait.  It wasn't as if they were busy or anything. Ugh hate poor service if you hate your job go get another one.  And she gave me ONE pouch of ketchup for a whole wrap. What an idiot. They deserve  0 star."}
{"text":"If i could leave zero stars i would--place is terrible. The burgers are clearly frozen, and it doesnt even look like real meat. Absolutely horrible. Fries were good, but how can you mess up fries?  Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"True Burger is situated at the far end of the terminal, so unless your gate is down that way, you might miss it. I thought their burger was fantastic... the meat has a ton of flavor, and you can dress it up however you like  They do offer beer and liquor, but the spirits are way overpriced... C$22 for a shot of Maker's Mark?? Really?? I can get an entire bottle for that. And bartender/server Wendy was not at all friendly... borderline rude, very inattentive, and acted like I was imposing on her plans for the day.  The burger is worth stopping in for, but skip the booze."}
{"text":"Having spent more time in airports than I care to admit, trapped in terminals - I can say that I should've seen \"True Burger\" coming.   \"True\" indicates some sort of purity, but really it's an just airport burger... only slightly greasier and more expensive than regular airport burgers even. (The Five Guys airport version.) The line was long, but only due to the slow service at the register. If I'd have known how long I'd have to wait for my burger after finally ordering, I'd have gotten a cocktail as well (they're smart to serve them to appease the disgruntled airport crowd). It was overpriced for what you get, but that's any airport. The taste wasn't anything to write home about and my stomach felt like it should when you consume that kind of greasy food. On the bright side: sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid 2 star joint, but my experience was less than one star.   I'm going to come across a bit like an asshole beer snob, but hear me out.  In between connecting flights, I thought I would kill some time by ordering a beer.  I checked out what they had on tap, fairly crummy mainstream brews (I like craft beer myself)  except for an IPA... so I ordered that.  Both of the waitstaff advised me not to order it and told me to order a Bass instead.  It was all a bit confusing, but I wanted to try the local IPA, perhaps this was a very hoppy one and some people unaccustomed to that didn't like it.  Against the advice of the waitstaff I ordered the IPA.    I got a glass of beer, took a few sips and realized that it was not an IPA, craft beer or any type of non-commercial beer.  It wasn't a bad IPA, or a weak IPA, it simply was not an IPA, and not what I had ordered.  After being  ignored for a few minutes I flagged down the waitress.  I asked if I had gotten the IPA, she said yes.  I was friendly and told her perhaps the drought lines where switched.  She said that the lines where not switched and that everybody complains about that beer, which is why she told me not to order it.  I asked she could give me a Bass instead, she said no.  I was very confused and told her that this was not the right beer and that it tasted like Miller Lite.  The server got very defensive and told me that it definitely was not Miller Lite.  The server left, and after taking a sip or two of my beer (which was not what I had order)  I left and went to my gate.    20 minutes later one of the servers came to my gate and told me that I had left without paying.  I told her that I had hoped to do so!  She told me that If I did not pay that she was going to call security.      The woman from the bar found me at my gate to pay for a beer that I did not order and had maybe 5 sips of.  I was not going to miss my flight over this nonsense, so i smiled and was very friendly and returned to the restaurant and even left a good tip.  This is a worthless establishment even for an airport bar. Serving up a beer on a tap that is not what it says it is wrong (and probably against some type of law).  The fact that they took the time to find me at my gate over 1/4 of a beer blows my mind.  When I get back to the states I can dispute the charge on my card, hopefully the servers can keep they tip, they sure need it."}
