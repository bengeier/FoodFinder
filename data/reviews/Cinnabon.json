{"text":"Well, you know what cinnabon tastes like. Everyone knows. They're such a delicious way to treat yourself. The smell pulled me over, but the gentlemen working was so friendly, he gave my friend and I both little samples on toothpicks and was in such a jovial mood that it made us that much more happy we came over after our shopping. He even added a little more icing on half (we were going to split it).

I think the service at this Cinnabon was especially sweet. Kudos to their staff."}
{"text":"Great Cinnabons! The only reason I gave them a 4 star is because they have poor customer service. She never smiled at me.  Near gate A30. 8:15pm."}
{"text":"I love cinnabon. This one is an ok one.  Mostly everything gets baked fresh about every half hour. The service is ok and the workers aren't to friendly but I don't care I just want the cinnabon."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with a sweet tasting Cinnabon roll.  My favorite comes with pecans which gives your desert or breakfast a nice littlee crunch."}
{"text":"First stop when in Vegas? 
Cinnabon because we're hungry fresh off this road trip. 
Next we'll go to Luxor and before we leave we're back here again along with Fat Tuesdays... this goes good with Fat Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Tip: get some.

If you need me to tell you about Cinnabon, you really haven't lived as a red-blooded American. Cinnabon is like the overweight, gun-toting, conservative distant relative you only see once or twice a year at family reunions or funerals. But damn it if you don't love them because they'd have your back if you were getting carjacked or if you needed a truck to move a washer/dryer. That, ladies and gents, is Cinnabon. You don't wanna eat there every day, but they are there for you at malls and airports across America...or as they say it: `Merica!!"}
{"text":"I was supposed to go to a meeting today and I was going to pick some up at Eglinton station. I didn't go to the meeting and ended up at Dufferin Mall and howdy dowdy there's a Cinnabon store! Yay! Serendipity! I bought a box of minis. I was sharing my Cinnabon story but the staff either didn't care or had no sense of humour."}
{"text":"This place is closed and therefore crushed my soul. RIP Cinnabon. I looked all over for this place only to find that it was permanently closed. :("}
{"text":"Poor costomer service. Like wtf i was super in a good mood but theyre is always that one person with a shitty attitude. Yall need to re evaluate your lives. Frfr."}
{"text":"Got a deal that came with a medium coffee, (which I must admit, was nothing special), and a Centre of the Roll, which i found extremely delicious. Everyone knows that the best part of a cinnamon roll is it's sticky, warm centre, and that's exactly what I got. Not too mention it was topped with tons of icing to make it that much better, the roll definitely made up for the mediocre coffee."}
{"text":"So conveniently located right of the terminal when I got off my flight. The gal working there made sure I had the freshest, gooey cinnabon. Great service and awesome food!"}
{"text":"This is the Cinnabon inside the Phoeniz airport! It is not a real Cinnabon. 

The coffee was not Cinnabon coffee. It was shared with the Burger King next door. Yuck.

The roll was not fresh. Threw it away half-eaten."}
{"text":"Oh my sweet darling 8,000 calorie ooey, gooey delight. You are my pre-flight tradition. Prior to boarding I always purchase one cinnamon role to eat on board for two reasons. The first, because it's usually the start of my vacation piggery and my low carb diet goes out the window. The second, this could be my last meal and I sure as hell don't want it to be airline slop."}
{"text":"Needed something to eat on a short layover.  Everything except Pizza Hut Express was closed and even this place was near closing.  Unfortunately, the buns didn't look so fresh, but I got one anyway.  I've had Cinnabon before and I love them, but by the time these things are exposed to airport fumes, they must go bad just like every other airport food court food.  I ate the stale thing while waiting to board my next flight.  I wished I had a couple shots of grand marnier to wash it down.  You really must get these things when they are fresh.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"The line is not well marked, where do you start??, it's kind of important. 

The coffee was generic, there were no coffee stirrers, the lids were clear plastic & I don't think their meant for hot drinks. 

I wasn't looking to be blown away, but I was less than impressed."}
{"text":"Early morning coffee...NO STARBUCKS for me (it always tastes burnt)...

Cinnabon, you are right across from my gate on my flight to San Diego.  Thank goodness you offer me coffee!

Your prices are better than the other coffee purveyor...and I got the slightest hint of chicory in your coffee...so I was pleased.

Granted, no coffee stirrers, but there are straws on the wall next to the lid dispensor (which is a coffee lid, designed for hot drinks, not clear plastic).

For the morning go cup, you fill the bill."}
{"text":"Airport cinnabon... not sure what I expected.  Cinnamon role was not exactly what I would call \"fresh.\"  I ate it anyway, because I'm a fat ass and I love me some cinnabon.

But, the \"meh I've experienced better\" rating applies, because I have experience better cinnabons."}
{"text":"Came to get a classic roll. When the employee scooped up my delicious pound of cinnamon and dough into the carton she asked if I wanted a little more of the \"sauce\" on top. HELL YES I DO! If you're eating here it's not because you're concerned about what you're about to put down your throat. So let's not pretend that saying no was even an option. She loaded it up and sent me on my way to sugar coma bliss."}
