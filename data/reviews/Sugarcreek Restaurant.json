{"text":"Sugarcreek missed the mark today with their Easter buffet. Rude wait staff,the tasteless food was unappealing.  We love the place but for 15.99 I expect more than desserts bought at Aldi's"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Breakfast.. Delicious  Sunday Breakfast Buffet Can't be beat!! Dinner Homemade everything! WOW.. Our whole family loves everything here! Perch.. The best you will find! Burgers Hands Down Delicious!! They accommodate our Huge family! This placeDeserts are to die for!!"}
{"text":"Just went to this family restaurant today for dinner...all I can say is WOW, INCREDIBLE!!! Where do I start? The portions are huge, the employees are friendly, the food comes out fast and fresh, and the value can't be beat. I am tired of supporting the huge corporate franchises that make you think you are getting a good deal but then you realize you need to buy 3 meals to fill yourself. This is a restaurant that finally gets it. I heard they just got a new breakfast menu too...looks like I'll be stopping in again tomorrow morning! More people need to experience this place"}
{"text":"I found this place when I worked in N.Ridgeville a few years ago.  Now my boyfriend and I go there when he has a day off.  I love the fountain and how each area has it's own decor.  Portions are huge, so go hungry.  Plenty to choose from, so if you can't find anything to eat, you are too picky!  I love the fried mashed potatoes and they are hot so be careful when eating (and I mean heat hot,not spicy)   Bathrooms are a little cramped and I think it  would be hard for a wheel chair to negotiate."}
{"text":"Went at 1 pm on a Friday. Only one other table in use. I had a Rueben with fries. Fries very good but sandwich disappointing. Not huge as previously reviewed. Dressing on side. Average size and soggy on bottom when served. Partner had a grilled turkey ciabatta. It was undercooked and tomato slices were awful. $20 for lunch. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the amish roast turkey and the picture on the menu looked good. Well it was not, the turkey on the menu  had brown gravy and what was served was chicken gravy. The turkey was so dry that it was very unappetizing. When he told the waitress that it was bad, she of course apologized and offered something else. Now mind you they offer side that come with the meal. He got cottage cheese and the soup. Well since he did not eat the meal, they decided to charge him $6.00 for the cottage cheese and the soup, when the entire meal would have cost 8.29. When we advised the hostess she had the nerve to offer us coupons for when we come back. We laughed at her and said when hell freezes over we will be back. You have the nerve to charge for things that come with the meal and the main part of the meal sucked. You have alot of nerve. Also the fish fry, is okay had better, the soup you can tell is from a can and the cole slaw tasted watered down, like they were trying to stretch it out. Won't be back nor will we recommend this place even to our enemies."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a diner that isn't fast food or a chain and found it! A slice of heaven with good servers and good food. They have a breakfast buffet that is priced very reasonably, will try that the next time I go! Good biscuits and sausage gravy!"}
{"text":"At first you can be alittle unsure when you walk in. looks alittle run down and poorly lit. The menu had much to choose from. I ordered an omlet home fties and biscut with gravy and let me tell you it was wonderful. The gravy was so darn good I wanted to lick the plate. Homemade chicken soup has a great hearty flavor. I love finding little gems like these. Its your hidden diner, drive ins and dives. Dont judge this book by the cover. I am so glad we ate here."}
{"text":"Very good home-cooked food! The portions were larger than we expected, and we didn't have to wait long for the food on a Saturday evening. Prompt and courteous service. Plenty of space, does not have that crowded feeling. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"great home-style cooking. always fresh, hot, & extra-generous portions. prices are great too. taste of home!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff! We came this way for our Cedar Point trip and happened to make a highway stop for Burlington and saw this restaurant hidden in a corner. We made the choice to eat here cause we hate eating at places we can eat at home (ERIE, PA). Walking in was a little over whelming...we were stared at the whole time by customers. Apparently they never seen city folks or young people for that matter. Our waitress was very kind and new the menu. Or food was delicious and the cakes looked amazing. Although I was confused on the community atmosphere. I did feel like we were in a retirement community of 60 and older. The fountain display is neat yet unusual. Walking into the restaurant your greeted with dolls for sale, like China dolls and barbie dolls...which was kinda weird.  But for food...we were hungry and we left full. Would I go back? 50/50 chance...it was good for us but I don't think I'd run and grab all my friends to come."}
{"text":"Breakfast and service were excellent. The place is a little rundown and when I asked to close the shutters to keep the sun out of my eyes, the response was mute. They finally did it but there were no strips to the shutters. Come on....spend a few bucks to replace. Otherwise I would go back but not sit by the window. Lol"}
{"text":"We were on a cross country road trip and stopped in here because it wasn't a chain restaurant. That said, when we saw the menu we were scared because usually a menu that is 5 pages long means nothing is fresh, but we were wrong. The wings were made super fresh and were delicious. Everything was super tasty!"}
{"text":"Fresh every time I order. Fast friendly service. Here's another first for me Cajun chicken"}
{"text":"We went today for lunch after a funeral. I'm giving 2 stars today for the following reasons.  They knew we were coming, and that it would be a large group. The tables were dirty, no sugar in the sugar bowls,  no creamer on the tables, and just to get drinks took 40 minutes!  Seriously 40 minutes for drinks. I ordered coffee and water, I had to find a table and get my own creamer and sugar.  And forget about refills. I will say the chicken noodle soup was very tasty everyone enjoyed it.  Almost everyone at my table ordered the bacon cheeseburger and it was very good as well, and surprisingly served warm. I've eaten here before and the food always outshines the service.  The restaurant is in desperate need of a face lift and the bathrooms always appear dirty, although i believe it's just dingy and in need of an overhaul as well.  Even after this review we'll be back eventually because of the portion sizes at the price you can't beat."}
{"text":"My grandma and I go here for lunch sometimes. I love their chicken Alfredo and their breakfasts. The decor is a a little gaudy, but that's what makes this place unique."}
{"text":"Good, home style cooking. Room for big groups. Easy access off Route 2, so good place to stop if you're traveling through."}
{"text":"I have a sentimental attachment to Sugarcreek because almost every weekend my family gathers here for breakfast. With our busy schedules it seems that the weekend mornings are the only time that the grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, sons and daughters can all gather to catch up and enjoy each others company. The food is good for a family restaurant and priced well. My go to menu item is always the western omelet, and my mom is a fan of the chocolate chip pancakes. The service can be hit or miss at times, but at least all the waitresses will recognize you by name or face and are super friendly. Just a little slow at times. The decor is a bit bizarre. There is a huge fountain/waterfall/garden in the middle of the restaurant that is strange, but serves as a good conversation starter and a distraction for the kids. I do wish they would take down the handmade dolls they have lined on every shelf, though. They creep me out. All in all, I would say give it a try if you are ever in the area for breakfast."}
{"text":"The meal was great the service a little slow but everything tasted great and staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Do not like this place at all. It is very bland food. To me it is for Senior Citizens. Servers are not very friendly."}
{"text":"There isn't a great deal we can add to the other reviews here.  Good, home-made comfort food.   Large servings.  Friendly service.  It was all there during our visit last night.   My wife had a Mediterranean wrap and I had the beef tips and noodles.  Everything was very good with the home-made potato chips worthy of note.  It's right off of I-90 about 20 miles west of Cleveland so it would be a good stop for hungry  cross country travelers."}
{"text":"YUCK YUCK YUCK!!!!! Steer clear of this place. Presentation is awful. I couldn't even eat the food."}
{"text":"This was a nice affordable family restaurant with great service and they give you tons of food!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice on vacation this week. Food and prices were both great. Service was fairly quick both times. Only poor spot I've experienced was both mornings the server we had was not pleasant at all. Always seemed bothered to help us and never seen her smile. Other than the I loved the biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"Food and staff okay. Potatos need seasoning. Atmospere has a golden corral feeling. Low on cash or have big family this is your place. Not my favorite place."}
{"text":"The wife and I like to try local flavor as we travel cross country, and she found this gem as we were transiting through Ohio, and in desperate need of some non-franchise sustenance.  As other reviews have noted, the decor can be a bit unusual seeming, with a very large fountain in the main floor of the restaurant and a lot of dolls about ... but on to the food !  The Sugarcreek Restaurant has a large, varied and extensive menu, including amish inspired recipes. The wife and I ordered the Meatloaf and Amish Turkey dinners, and were frankly blown away by the portion sizes.   The $ 9 Amish Turkey Dinner came with a roll, a salad, a soup and on the entree plate itself, a larger portion of turkey than I ate on Thanksgiving, about two cups of their unique breaded-and-fried-mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables. There was plenty of food !   The food was hot, fresh and tasty and left us both positive and satisfied. If we were locals, we'd definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Came here for DINNER, with the family. After sampling Blue Sky and not enjoying it I wasn't thrilled but the veterans event at Golden Corral was dangerous (parking and homeless veterans) so my husband and his brother and family decided on here... I want looking on enjoying it.   But I was pleasantly surprised, our group of 5 was seated, drinks and food ordered all in 10 minutes I had the beef tips and noodles (egg noodles beef mushrooms gravy) perfect 8, chicken noodle in a bowl (more like a Japanese tea cup size) was great but 3 dollars kinda steep, the quesadilla (with chicken) were good, hubby ordered a Gyro and loved it, my brother in law had ribs (with BBQ) and enjoyed it, my sister in law got the Philly Cheesesteak and loved it, my nephew loved his potato skins and mozy sticks, hubby loves the coffee.   the biggest down side are the bathrooms, there spic and span but the first smell that hits you walking in is bleach, and the first stall door can hit you as you walk in too... and when I go potty in a restaurant I love a pleasant BM experience (banging doors next door isn't zen like).   I'd say 86% over all.  I'll bring my mom and daughter here. They are bigger critics than me."}
{"text":"Great Lunch spot! Wonderful service and delicious desserts. Shout out to Sandra, our server, who was very personable and polite. Will be back next time in town."}
{"text":"The waitress was rudely pointing out the bandage on my mothers nose from surgery (she had recently been diagnosed with skin cancer) the waitress kept gasping and commenting on it like if it was the most horrifying thing she has ever seen, not only was this unprofessional but very rude and made my mother feel very bad..the food here was horrible..mashed potatoes tasted like it came from a box..agree with the person who said i felt like i was eating at a retirement home..pretty much sum's it up."}
{"text":"Maybe breakfast isn't the best time to come...  Highlights of our visit: dirty coffee cups, hygiene issues amongst the staff, food that tasted like it was out of a can, and the spider hanging over our table that we had to kill ourselves.  Well, at least the service was friendly, and my pepsi was okay.  Suffice it to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Was in Elyria for a dance competition and decided to try this place out for brunch. They've got some great menu items and the prices are very reasonable. Would recommend going there to anyone passing through looking for a non-chain place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The food is absolutely disgusting. Eggs have no flavor, coffee tastes weird, meat was gummy and over cooked. Even the biscuit tasted old and stale. They served hostess baked goods cut in half on their almost $10 buffet."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this mom and pop establishment. We had breakfast here everyday while on vacation and we always left stuffed and happy. The skillets, omelettes, and specials were great. Very reasonably priced with quick friendly service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Lorain county to eat. I love the breakfast bar on Sundays and the variety the menu has. I've been eating at this place for a long time. The portions are very good and you will have to take some of your meal home. Great family restaurant!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and price.  Just had my sons 16th birthday party here.  They were very accommodating."}
{"text":"What a great little gem, hidden away in a strip mall.  The only way I learned of this place was through Yelp.  We went for breakfast on a Sunday and had no problem getting a seat.  The restaurant is large and has a cute fountain with flowers in the center.   They had a breakfast buffet for slightly over $9 and there was a nice array of foods, but I am not a buffet person.  I had the eggs Benedict which was very good.   The eggs were poached better than I make them and the hollandaise sauce was yummy.  The home fries were just ok.   My husband had the Belgian waffle and sausage patties.   It was a bit overdone so was very crispy.   He had to ask for syrup which we thought was odd as it should have been served with it.  Service wasn't great which is why I gave it 4 stars.   Definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"Stopped by due to the reviews on Yelp and I'm very pleased. Lots of delicious food. Clean with a homey atmosphere. Perch was great and the best home fries I've ever had. I'll be back."}
{"text":"What a gem!!  Came here based on the reviews and the desire for something other than the usual.   We ordered:  Open faced meatloaf sandwich  Fettuccini Alfredo  French Dip Open faced roast beef    Salads were fresh, bean soup was very good.   Everything was fresh and delicious!!!  Real mashed potatoes!!    This is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"They have brought back the lost art of good service and great potato skins. I've driven past this place most likely 1000 times in my life and never once thought to stop. So glad I did. My belly is full and my wallet didn't take a dent. The other thing that impressed me, everyone here was talking...to each other. Great family restaurant"}
{"text":"8:50am on a Sunday! The buffet should be hot! My eggs were cold and the waffles will be used as a frisbee at the family picnic. The quiche was brought out cold! I had to ask to heat it up. For $10 a plate, I should have gone to First Watch. P.S. only place that serves Ho-Ho's on the buffet. LOL. Classy."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a great price! Atmosphere could be refreshed but the value can't be beat! I love the comfort food ( Amish roast turkey) but really can't wait for the French onion soup!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a simple breakfast, and were very pleased overall.  I had a cheddar cheese and onion omelette, and 2 pancakes.  The omelette was truly one of the best i've ever had!  Flavorful, large (they must use several eggs), fluffy, and not greasy, just like a world class omelette should be!  Ditto the excellent pancakes, which were the size of a small Frisbee!  Fluffy, airy, and even better tasting than ones you would find at any IHOP.  Our server was very attentive 'old pro', with a good sense of humor.  I forget her name, but it might as well have been 'Flo' or 'Josie'.  Locally owned and run  'mom and pop' diners and family restaurants like Sugarcreek are precisely why I prefer them over the more pricey, and often dissapointing national chains."}
{"text":"Great comfort food restaurant! The location is great and there is plenty of parking. Our server was OK, but not great. The restaurant is clean and bright. The menu is extensive and prices are reasonable.   We were there for breakfast. I ordered the Belgian Waffle with sausage patties. My wife ordered Eggs Benedict. Both meals were very good.    If you like comfort food, I would suggest that you try Sugarcreek."}
{"text":"Five stars without a doubt. Hands down, this has been the best restaurant in Ohio. Everything is homemade daily. The soup, oh so good. Portions are phenomenal. The staff was extremely professional. Love the fountain in the middle of the restaurant. Sugarcreek, you are my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"We went here on the way to Great Wolf Lodge for brunch. There are a lot of options for breakfast. A lot of different and interesting waffles, omelettes and pancakes. I ordered the Mediterranean omelette and asked for egg whites. She didn't bring it with egg whites and there wasn't much feta. I got the fruit which was good. My hubby got the sugar creek combo with French toast, eggs and bacon. He liked it. My son got chocolate chip pancakes and they put a smily face on it which was cute. I gave it 4 stars because I didn't get the egg whites and the omelette was really light with the feta. The hubby thought his was good but not awesome."}
{"text":"Nothing positive to say about this restaurant, we've tried it twice now, and never again!  Went there for breakfast, the food was inedible, just gross - cold (bacon, eggs & toast), some of it had a \"odd\" odor to it, not fresh(?).  Server/service was terrible, as others stated acted as if we were bothering her, asked for a glass of water when we ordered - never received one, sat with an empty coffee cup for 15-20 minutes, it was as if she was put out by giving us more coffee.  Not sure how this place gets good ratings, or has survived, but we will NOT go back - EVER!  Oh and for the price - we've experienced FAR better!  Paid $10 and drank 1.5 cups of coffee and ate 3 pieces of COLD bacon - choked down one piece of cold hard toast!  By far one of our worst experiences - YUCK!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet is awesome. Always huge portions and great price. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was great. It came out quickly and the waitress was pleasant. The price was very reasonable. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I was really bummed when I realized that for the last 8 years I had been driving past this place without even giving it a second glance, not knowing what treasures were inside.         The little lady and I stopped in one day after reading some good reviews about this place on Yelp. I was surprised. I had always thought this place was one of those smelly diners that reheated canned vegetables for you and charged you 10 times what it would cost you if you would have just stayed home and made it yourself. It was the exact opposite. You can go in there and get a massive meal for   under 10 bucks, and that's even after leaving a 25% tip. The waitresses make you feel like they actually want you there and really care about the quality of your dining experience. The cooks treat every dish like Michelangelo would treat a piece of marble. The food always comes out in under 15 minutes. I can't recommend this place enough."}
