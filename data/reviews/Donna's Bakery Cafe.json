{"text":"YES YES YES!! Finally a 5 star all the way cafe that not only treats their customers like family, but offers an out of the park menu! From their delicious cakes and pastries, to their outstanding smoothies and coffee drinks, this place has it all. We went in for lunch on Saturday (we usually go in 3-4 times a week), and had the roast beef sandwich along with a strawberry boba to wash down and all I can say is OMG!!! The roast beef was peppered to perfection to add just the right amount of spice which I tend to love...not too overpowering, but you know its there.  Coming from NY, I have had my share of boba drinks, and their strawberry boba is definitely top notch.  I can't wait to try all the drinks on the menu...only problem is every time I try a new one,  I end up getting it over and over!  If you haven't tried this place yet, you are definitely missing out.  Forget fast food...Donna's is where its at!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a weekday while doing some shopping at the Ranch L next door. To my surprise, found some pullman loaves in white and whole wheat. Pullman loaves are pretty rare in my experience -- you usually only find them in Japanese or Taiwanese bakeries -- but they make exquisite sandwiches and toast. They hold up really well and have a nice thickness, nice texture. Yes, it was indeed a little pricier than say going to the Safeway or what have you, but, that's why I don't buy bread there and instead source it from local bakeries, like this one. Also they freeze pretty well too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been eating at Donna's for over a year now. He works right by it, so here comes here several times a week. They have the best, freshest veggies, they make their own bread, and they have fantastic desserts. They also have a punch card to earn free sandwiches. This is by far the best sandwich/bakery in this area, and it's nice to support local businesses. Definitely give Donna's a try! (Their veggie sandwich and pork sandwich is killer!)"}
{"text":"I bought fruit cake here for my wife bday and it was delicious. I like the fruit sponge cake here. when ever there is any bday of my friends i buy here.I would definetly recommend"}
{"text":"We passed up nearby chain sandwich shops to grab a sandwich at Donna's and are so glad that we did!  Everything was incredibly fresh; we watched the employee put our orders together right in front of us.  The food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  I look forward to going back and trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Donna is super sweet and the cake was absolutely delicious - baked fresh the morning of the event.  Everyone loved it.   Thanks Donna.  She was also very patient in taking the design order from my son.  Would have loved to post photo of beautiful cake but I don't know how to do it."}
{"text":"My parents bought me a fresh fruits cake for my birthday. The cake was nicely decorated, the fruits were fresh. The actual cake tasted blend and dried even with the fresh fruits filling. Very disappointed, our family will not buy cake for any special occasion again because we don't want to feel disappointed. We were so looking forward to a tasty cake. Asahi makes better cake, too bad they were closed today. So, we thought we give this place a try."}
{"text":"Kids (adult daughter & 9 y/o grandson)  & I stopped by, really just looking for a bathroom w/breakfast. Saw \"Bakery Cafe\" & OPEN, so we stopped in. Awesome Accident! Great breakfast burritos for the gals & grilled ham & egg & cheese sammich for the boy. Great cookies too."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this little bakery! The ladies at the front are always so cheerful and helpful!  They really do care about their customers and I appreciate that.   Support the local business!"}
{"text":"Just had similar bad experience today!  I ordered cakes before but today's server was horrible!  I ordered thai milk tea with boba.  I am an pure Asian I know exactly what is the thai milk tea tastes like.  Long story short, the milk tea tasted sour and just like the expired milk tastes.  I went to the counter and talked to the long dark hair server and told her the taste is not right, it's like spoiled milk.   Oh my gosh!!!  Believe or not she turned back and opened the milk container lid smelt the milk, then she said to another server: \"I know our milk tea still good, it's just her!\"  Come on girl, I'm not deaf I heard what you say!  I told her: I know what is thai milk tea and I tried many places before and never sour or off flavor like this!  She asked me: did you buy from us?  I said no, she said: this is our milk tea flavor, I know it's different flavor but we just made it 2 days ago!  WTF!!  (Sorry, shouldn't used that words it may have kids reading these) 2 days ago?!  are you Kidding me??  Okay, I think she is not kidding at all and I have to changed a new taro flavor one as she offered!  But no doubt, the same off flavor tea, the same spoiled milk they made 2days ago!   I swear never ever go back to order anything from there.  Feel really sorry the owner is an Ansian, but the low quality food and service convince me to say NO MORE SPOIL MILK TEA FROM DONNA'S!!!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our dad's birthday this weekend, complete with a cake from Donna's Bakery Cafe (as per mom's suggestion).  Boy, we were not disappointed!  Ordered a few days beforehand... pick-up was as scheduled.  We had an 8\" strawberry cheesecake mousse cake... soooo delicious!  The birthday guy was happy.  I was bummed that our weekend stay was over so quickly--I didn't get a chance to go for the leftovers.  Thank you Donna's Bakery Cafe!"}
{"text":"I recently had a last second birthday cake I needed done with very short notice.  Not only did they have my cake ready in a very short time, it turned out great and was delicious!  I talked with the baker over the phone to customize the colors and design a bit and they were very cooperative and helpful.  AND the price was great for what we got.  I'm not a big fan of sweets, but this cake was amazing!"}
{"text":"So to my delight a Chinese bakery in a non-Asian area of AZ!  I just happened to stop in Tempe for lunch and checked out Yelp for some place to eat.  Read some of the reviews of this place and thought I'd give it a try.... lo and behold, Chinese Bakery!  I was happy :) Sandwich was good (Chicken Salad with Walnuts) but the Pork Bun was quite tasty!  A bit too much bread but BBQ Pork was good. They also prolly could be a much better place if they cleaned up a bit more but....  For anyone in Tempe area looking for a place to get some great bakery, come to Donna's!"}
{"text":"The best thing for a good pick up and go are the BBQ pork and cream cheese buns."}
{"text":"Nice spot to grab some sweets. Place is a little squished with all the tables and stuff. Some of their best buns are on the shelves, like the Red Bean and BBQ Pork flavors. Their bread loafs could use some work though, like the Banana nut - which wasn't \"banana\" enough for me, or the chocolate bread, which with every bite was faling apart on my lap as I drove back home that day.   They got drinks too. I suggest any of their fruit smoothies, like the Mango flavor. But, I avoid on getting Iced coffee, it was just too creamy or sugary and it had lost all its coffee-ness when I drank it...  Prices are reasonable. Nothing too outrageous but I saw some of their sandwich specials were in the $5 to $6 range, and something about adding a drink or chips for about an extra $1  I admit, I'm cheap which is why I go to a lot of Asian bakeries. This one nice cause its close to work and a gas station. And furthermore, I don't have high expectations for these places, but to me this place is just OK."}
{"text":"Love it here!  Great friendly customer service, yummy lunch specials and the orange pound cake and honeydew smoothie among other things will satisfy your sweet tooth:)"}
{"text":"It was OK. I only got a boba tea and it didn't really impress me. The place looks a lot like a Subway sandwich shop, but has a lot more variety."}
{"text":"The cake was delicious, when I went inside to pick up the cake, I had no clue they sold sandwiches/coffee/etc.   But overall, it was good and the staff was very kind."}
{"text":"Solidly mediocre. Breakfast burritos were bland, iced Vietnamese coffee was very watery, did not taste like Vietnamese coffee at all.  Pasties are just okay."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich heaven!!!!! Great prices, amazing food. Get the breakfast sandwich on the sandwich roll as opposed to the toast, it's incredible. They have an amazing looking selection of pastries and sweets too. I can't wait to go back and try their lunch and desserts."}
{"text":"LOVE the fruit topping style cakes, great for special occasions and (non Asian) people find it especially unique.  Not in love w/ their single cake slices w/ the mousse pudding, cake is dry.  GO FRUIT CAKE ALL THE WAY!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Donna's Bakery Cafe after a friend had mentioned it to me.  I stepped inside thinking it was strictly a Chinese bakery, but to my delight, they offered much more than just Chinese baked goods (especially for being a small shop).  I bought quite a few baked goods - red bean buns, custard buns, bbq pork buns, and coconut bread, and they were all fresh and tasty.  I'm looking forward to stopping by again for some more treats.  Nomnomnom.  Bonus points for the staff (owners?) - they are nice, hard-working folk who keep the place clean!"}
{"text":"It is dark inside, therefore make me dont want to buy it anymore"}
{"text":"Great little local cafe with awesome breakfast and lunches. they also have great pastries, cookies and cakes."}
{"text":"What is missing in the Phoenix area is a good Chinese bakery like they have in L.A. !! I was hoping Donna's bakery will be the bakery to fill the need.  I paid $20 for a small customs cake, hoping it will be better than the supermarket heavy frosting type.  Sadly it was not up to expectation for an Asian style cake with fruits.  The cake tasted like it was made many days ago and the frosting was dry, not light & tasty like expected.  It probably was made the day I ordered it but wasn't due for pick up until several days later.  There goes my hope of finding a good Chinese bakery !!"}
{"text":"If you want great tasty boba, head next door to Super L Ranch Market.  If you want fresh daily baked breads, again, head next door to Super L.  All products are made fresh daily, no shipment come in weekdays.  All are freshly made for your enjoyment."}
{"text":"So we just happen to see this place and decided to take my toddler in for a treat.  We came in on a Saturday.  There were (literally) a handful of dessert items in the display and very few baked goods (like the Asian breads).  I asked the lady what was up with that and she said shipments come during the week.  1.)  I guess they don't make it in the store but it's called a bakery?  2.) She specifically said to come on Tuesdays so that leads me to believe the baked goods are not fresh daily.    What they did have out, however, looked beautiful.  Just like how I remember an Asian bakery should be ... except sparse ... and not fresh.  So we had a couple of things.  The taro boba wasn't good at all.  It just tasted icy.  It didn't have any of the rich texture that I'm used to.  We also had a chocolate pound cake type dessert.  It wasn't very sweet - which I like - and my husband noticed there were no chocolate chips.  Well, it's not an American pastry store silly.  I really wanted to like this place b'c I hardly go to the COFCO Center nowadays.  There's just not much there except the grocery store so it's not really worth the 45 minute drive for me.  Having a bakery would've totally given me an incentive.  Next time we go to the area I'd like to come during the weekday, preferably on a Tuesday.   Maybe you will have better luck than me!"}
{"text":"this bakery shop can really kill people.   not sure what's stuff they put in their cookies..it's horrible and make you sick to your stomache.....nasty food, everything is stale and old.  service is horrible too.   i will file a complaint to the better business bureau and might even sue them if my kids don't get better by tomorrow."}
{"text":"I did not do direct business but my mom bought a cake from here for my baby shower. All I can say is Oh. My. Goodness. Not only was it absolutely beautiful and flawless, the taste was SO good. It was the white mousse I believe with white cake and fruit on top. Everyone loved the cake and asked where it was from. It was so light and delicious. Not too sweet either. Just perfect! If I have any more parties in need of a cake, this is definitely where I will be coming!"}
{"text":"This place is so hit or miss....some days their breakfast burritos are great and other days it seems like a kid threw it together. I'm not sure if it depends who makes it or what but you'd think the type of ingredients they use wouldn't change. Today my burrito was tasteless and the potatoes which were smooshed tater tots were kinda gross. Good luck."}
{"text":"Donna's cakes are amazing and beautiful as well as delicious. I've ordered 3 so far. She makes a gorgeous Yule Log cake at Christmas with a mocha flavor and delightful decorations. I showed her a picture of a cake online I wanted her to make for my son's birthday that looks like a real train. She went above and beyond.  I can't wait to drop by here for breakfast or lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Best place to get asian cakes in the valley! We ordered a cake on the same day with custom prints of the school logo and picked it up a few hours later. The frosting is light and not too sugary."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place.  It is one of the few take out joints in the neighborhood and the prices are reasonable.  The food - average.  The service - atrocious.  I have eaten there three times and give the café three strikes (I won't be going back)  Strike One - - Walked in and a customer was having an argument with a young lady behind the counter.  The issue was that the customer had ordered 18 sandwiches for a business lunch and when they arrived there were only 16.  I heard the counter girl say: \"There were 18 sandwiches when the tray left here\" and the customer (who was trying to get the full order for a lunch meeting that had already started) said \"I'm not lying.  If I had wanted 20 sandwiches I would have ordered 20...but I wanted 18 and got 16\".  The order was reluctantly filled and the customer looked like she had been interrogated by the Maricopa County Sheriff Dept.   Strike Two -- One of the items on the menu is a tuna salad which includes swiss AND cheddar cheese.  I called in an order the first time and asked if that could be made with ONLY cheddar.  The girl said yes and made the salad. When I called back three days later I ordered the same salad, also only cheddar cheese and was told that the cheese comes pre-packaged (hmmm) and the cheddar couldn't be separated from the swiss.  I mentioned that I had it that way a few days before and she said \"I have to slice it that way\"...and I said \"can you?\" and the response was \"I don't want to\".  So much for the customer always being right, eh?  She reluctantly agreed to do it, but when I picked up the salad got a little bit of attitude and thought to myself \"I drove past another deli (The Lunch Lounge) to get here and I don't need to put up with ANY attitude when I have choice in salads and lunchmeat!  Strike Three - Ok, maybe I'm a little harsh on this but I hate it when someone can't make change.  As I was paying the last time I was in there the bill totalled something like $11.97.  I gave the young woman at the cash register $20.02.  My change back was $7.04.  Of course she had to open the cash register to make the proper change - and she seemed perturbed at me for giving her the extra two cents...like it was my fault that she couldn't make change.  I don't know if there is a manager who is ever at this location (I didn't see anyone who appeared to be a \"boss\" when I was there)...but barring that just a nice lesson in customer service would go a long way.  I don't think I will be back..."}
{"text":"I dropped by this bakery after doing some research. Their macarons and filled buns are delicious."}
{"text":"You know...after reading all the rave reviews I was so excited in getting some Asian baked goods from Donna's. It has been SO long! Girlfriend was in the area so I gave her a list of things to pick up. She gets there and told me they don't have anything! What happened?!?? Well apparently there was a change about 2 weeks ago. They no longer have them ready to go. Everything must be ordered a day ahead of time. I am so bummed! No bbq pastries, no curry beef pastries, not even jasmine green tea cake. I was all ready to give Donna's a 5 star after sampling their goods. She was able to procure some BBQ pork buns. They were ok. Too much bread. I've had better at Dim Sum places. The coconut buns were pretty good though. I guess I really need to look around for a Vietnamese bakery. Your typical American bakery goods just doesn't excite me.... Meh..... I sure hope they would reverse their policy...."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and was really impressed with this place. I got a great sandwich with a drink and a homemade cookie for $9.  It was very hard to make a selection for lunch because I was distracted by all of the baked good. This place isn't the best atmosphere, nor does it have much seating- maybe enough for 10 people- but it deliciousness outweighs their decor."}
{"text":"I work right next to Donna's... and I just think these guys are the bees knees. Great breakfast... totally reasonable prices... incredibly nice staff people. I am addicted to their breakfast burritos.  For what it's worth, Donna's is actually the bakery that supplies a lot of the Asian Markets around town."}
{"text":"I heard about Donna's through New Times and Yelp. It's not common to have an Asian bakery open up  here in Phoenix but after hearing of the many delights they offer at low prices, I knew I had to check this place out!  My first visit I tried the bbq pork bun, the pork sung bun, the curry beef pastry, the bbq pork pastry and a slice of the jasmine green tea. The bbq pork bun, the curry beef and the bbq pastry reminded me of the pastries i would eat in Singapore, and in LA at a bakeshop i go to in Rosemead. It wasn't dry, and it was very good. The Pork Sung is pretty much dried pork pieces on a bun so it's an acquired taste something I'm not a fan of, so, I can really comment on that and to be fair I'm not sure if it's really that good. As for the Jasmine Green Tea cake, I think that's what they're good at, cakes. It was delicious, not sweet, and not bland but just right, hence I made the decision that I had to buy my brother's bday cake from their bakery.   We made a last minute to order his bday cake the day of and I pleaded my case with them if they could make an exception for the black forest cake but they said they were unable to make his cake within a day at such short notice but mentioned that they had 5 types of mousse cakes that they could whip up in a few hours. So we chose a 10 inch Passion fruit mousse cake, it was like $30. Thought it was a tad pricey but when we all had a slice, and when we saw it, it was WORTH it. Simply delicious, simply yummy. Loved the fruit and presentation, and again not overly sweet, just right. I like that the prices are low, and they're not overcharging for their snack items and sandwiches. The cakes are worth it and I'm looking forward to the day when I'll order my birthday cake, and this time I'm ordering the black forest, a week before just to be sure!"}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches and breakfast burritos. Cheap and tasty.   I got the wasabi streak sandwich with chips and a drink for $5 on special."}
{"text":"One should never complain about a $2 breakfast burrito!  I popped into Donna's bakery for the first time on my way into work last week.  The place is full of artistic pastries that look fantastic.   I ordered a breakfast burrito with eggs cheese and potatoes.  They had a bunch already prepared, but they had meat in them, so he had to make mine up.  It was pretty tasty, but when I got to the middle it was cold, so I guess the potatoes came from the fridge and didn't get heated all the way through in the microwave (Yes that's how he heated it up).  As I waited for my burro, I started window shopping the pastries, they were decently priced and already packaged up for quick carry out.  I decide to get a bean pastry with walnuts for an afternoon snack.   Unfortunately, when I took my first bite I could tell it was stale.   Have you ever had stale nuts? Well, they have a very distinct flavor and it definitely came through in the pastry.  I looked at the package and realized there was no date stamped, so who knows how long it had been sitting on the shelf.   Despite the less the ideal first visit, I'll give Donna's another try... the bean pastry might have just been a fluke."}
{"text":"I used to go to Donna's every now and then and have always had great tasting food.  Yesterday something was off.  When you walk into a bakery the only thing you should expect to smell is the baked goods.  The wonderful smells of the cakes, cupcakes and pastry goods.  That was not what attacked my nose.  I don't know what it was but it smelled like strong perfume.  It ranked up as one of the worst smells I have ever encountered in a restaurant.  Against better judgement I bought something to eat.  I'm blaming the stress from work and the craving to have an Asian pastry as to why I did it.    As I bit into the pastry all I could think about was the smell and whatever that smell was on the pastry and now I'm eating it.  I couldn't finish it and tossed it.    Sadly I doubt I will ever return.  Which is a shame because I want to go back and get those steamed buns."}
{"text":"The daily special was fantastic! Great small joint. Will definitely be back to try all of them!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered boba slushes from here but all their desserts always look so good.  Their slush is a dairy free smoothie, I usually get strawberry or strawberry mango and I've always enjoyed every slush I've bought."}
{"text":"I live close to Donna's and I am a frequent visitor. The desserts look and taste amazing. I usually get their daily sandwich special. It started out $3.99 for a sandwich,chips, & a drink. Now the price is $4.99,but you can get a cookie or chips. the price is still very good. The service is fast, I usually get it to go and by the time I fill my drink, the sandwich is ready. There is some seating inside for about 10 people. You get a choice of bread. The bread is very fresh as is the ingredients in the sandwich. They do custom cakes, but they are pricey and I have never ordered one. I have sampled the cake slices,the pound cake,individual pastries on the wall, and the cupcakes. They accept credit cards.  Currently the daily specials are: Monday-Turkey & avocado Tuesday-Hawaiian Wednesday- Roast beef Thursday-Turkey,ham,, & cheese Friday-Bacon, ham, & cheese Saturday-Wasabi Roast beef Sunday-Turkey & bacon"}
{"text":"I'm so upset. Today was my birthday and my husband spent money to get a custom cake ordered. We just cut into it and I am shocked. The \"cake\" part is dry and crumbly, and doesn't even take up half the cake. The top half of the cake is completely made up of whipped cream/frosting... is this how professional cakes are nowadays? We should have saved our money and made one homemade. Picture for reference (named scribbled out for privacy). One star for the perfect chocolate covered strawberries."}
{"text":"I work next door, and watched the progress with eager anticipation.  Once Donna's opened, was I ever happy!  While they are still new, the menu options are well thought out, and the deserts look as amazing as they taste.  The croissants are some of the best I've ever had.   I usually get their lunch special, a sandwich, drink and desert for under $10.00. My personal favorite is the walnut chicken salad on a croissant, but the roast beef with wasabi mayo is awesome as well.   When they first opened, the staff was slightly disorganized, but that has seemed to fade as everyone is now trained and comfortable.  They are always friendly, and will give you samples of anything in the place.  It's my new favorite for a casual, quick lunch meeting.  I'm glad they are closer to my work than my house, or I'd be there right now!"}
{"text":"I googled \"BBQ pork bun\" hoping to find some out here. We took a trip to San Fran in April and I have been wanting them ever since! They are amazing here! Perfectly sweet without being too much. I do wish they had more pork in them but they were still really good. I also had the cream cheese bun and it was amazing as well. Their bread is so good! We will be frequent visitors here!  My boyfriend's co-worker gets his breakfast burritos here every morning!"}
{"text":"Saturday Dec 24rd my wife told me she would like a Yule Log for Christmas. I work up in Nth Scottsdale and there are no Bakeries around where I work. Fired up Google and initially found nothing so expanded my search and found Donna's Bakery Cafe down in West Tempe, miles from me. Kept looking hoping to find something closer but no luck. Called Donna's and found that they had a cake, were going to be open till 6:00pm that night and could handle my business. They asked for my name and phone etc and I said I would be down later that day. As I left work so the rain came in and I made the long drive down the 101 f/way in holiday traffic and pouring rain... Fun.. I found Donna's on Elliot, parked and went in. There I found them putting the finishing touch's on a cake they had just made for me. That was a surprise as I hadn't realized they made to order. They boxed it for me and I went home. My wife loved the cake. My grandchildren loved the cake. I loved the cake. We had it for dessert on Christmas Day and loved every bite. The cake was light and fluffy to the bite and taste buds, the frosting and filling was just right. It was well worth the pain in the butt drive down there and home that day and I will certainly be buying more cakes from Donna's Bakery Cafe. To all the Ladies that were working there on Christmas Eve a very big Thank You."}
{"text":"I have been ordering cakes from Donna's for more than 1 year for various occasions. My family and friends really like their flavor and taste, and my favorite cake is their Durian Cake!"}
{"text":"I stopped here out of shear hunger and had time to kill. They  just had there grand opening the day before I got there. I walked in and the smell of the fresh breads were mind boggling. This place is very tiny and very cheerfully decorated and clean! The ladies behind the counter were still learning the tricks of the trade. Very sweetly greeted me and asked me what I like to order. They have about 10 different sandwiches posted on a very nice menu board and huge options for coffee and all the breads, cakes, pies, tarts, OMG Drool! They will make you any kind of sandwich and hand you more samples than you can shake a stick at. I order the turkey and had it on a fresh baked croisant. Too yummy to explain. The green tea was fresh brewed and out of this world. If you go remember they are as fast as Subway but they will knock your socks off!"}
{"text":"I asked for a iced coffee, add sugar free vanilla, and skim milk. The girl at the register and the shorter girl stated they didn't have skim milk, but they had soy. I said no thanks, I'll just have the sugar free vanilla then.  I watched her make my drink and add whole milk then she handed it to me. I said, \"Im sorry, I asked for no milk, I don't think you heard me.\" The girl at the register continued to argue that I asked for a latte and that has whole milk. I said, \"No, I said no milk since we just had the conversation in the past 3 minutes that you did not have skim.\" The girl still wanted to argue, I literally had to say to her, \"There's no point in arguing, can I have the correct drink I paid for?\" She rolled her eyes, and told the girl to remake the drink.  I can't believe that people who work in a customer service position want to argue over something so petty such as a drink order? On top of her lack of customer service, she had extremely long fake finger nails on, some had fallen off, and to my knowledge of food service you cannot have long fake nails, or fake nails at all! I hope no one had a nail come off in their food!  Who's running this place, and why aren't there more standards here? I will never come back here."}
{"text":"The first thing you have to ask yourself is ... why would I review a place I didn't even patron!!!  Because just walking in blew my mind!  I walked in and I literally felt like I was visiting a bakery in Singapore again.  The pastries and cakes ... I drool.  I did get to taste the green bean (no, not green beans - green mung beans) pastry and that wasn't bad at all.  Flakey, light, and traditional mung bean.  Can I have a cake from here for my next birthday?"}
{"text":"We have been ordering birthday cakes from them for years. Grew up in Asia I always complain American bakers use icing instead of whipped cream. Yeah I know, but I just don't like icing. I'm glad Donna's can make the cakes the way I like."}
{"text":"If you're ever around Tempe area check out Mama Donna's Bakery! The sandwiches are made fresh!! I had a tuna sandwich and it was perfectly made. I'm obsessed with bubble drinks and didn't want to drive miles out to my usual spot, so my Husband suggested this place since he work just down the road. Love it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the vanilla mousse cake for a birthday. It was a lovely decorated cake but the cake had no flavor and tasted horrible.  I will not be ordering another cake from here again."}
{"text":"How many times can someone drive by a place, yet no stop in? Too many, it seems!   Donna's Bakery Cafe is a cute little neighborhood bakery nestled in an unassuming Tempe strip mall. When I entered I was surprised to find it's actually an Asian bakery; rather uncommon for Tempe! Had I first read the Yelp reviews and visited their website, I might have been better prepared to expand my Asian baked goods horizons.   Needing to make a quick breakfast decision, I opted for the Bacon, Egg and Cheese sandwich on toasted white bread. The thick-cut bacon really made the sammy and it wasn't at all greasy like the mouthful of liquid cholesterol I recently had at a nationally known coffee chain. Of course, my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I also ordered a slice of the Chocolate Mousse cake (pictured) to go. How I was able to let it go untouched for hours is beyond my scope of understanding. It, too, was yummy, though the \"cake\" layers were a little on the dry side.   I'm happy to see another small-business-done-well. The service is fast and friendly and the prices are very reasonable ($1.99 for a breakfast sandwich or burrito!!!)  Without a doubt, I'll be visiting Donna's Bakery Cafe again, this time prepping my taste buds for something with a bit of Asian flair."}
{"text":"I would rate this establishment 0 stars if that was an option.  I have stopped in here on a few separate occasions after seeing their advertisements on their store front, and then seeing they had high yelp reviews.  Both of the times I have walked in with hopes of buying something, yet I have walked out empty handed.  Here is my problem with this place - it is advertising itself as a bakery/cafe ... Typically when one goes to a privately owned moms & pops type establishment like this, you expect to be able to buy freshly baked goods to order, and you expect to be able to order freshly made food/sandwiches/burritos/whatever customized to your liking.  Well, that is what a reasonable individual would expect.  Both of the times I stopped in here I wanted to modify food items that I wanted to try ... the last time it was a sandwich, and today I was interested in trying a breakfast burrito, since breakfast burritos are probably one of my favorite foods!!!  Great - they serve breakfast all day long ... Right?  $3.50 - $4.00 sounds like a great price too ... Right?  WRONG ... In a deceptive way these facts are true, but in reality it turns out that all the burritos are pre-made, and I suspect that they are most likely frozen burritos.    On one burrito I asked if I could have mine made up without chili sauce because I don't like super spicy foods.  The person behind the counter told me that they couldn't do that ... My response: So you are telling me that I can't get this burrito without chilli sauce?  Okay ....... so how about this other burrito - I would like my scrambled eggs with eggs whites only.  The woman behind the counter,  No, we can't do that either.....  My response - so what your telling me is that these are pre-made and not cooked/made fresh to order?  Two people from behind the counter then responded that the food is made in the morning, but the burrito is not put together until someone orders it.  So then why can you NOT put chilli sauce into this burrito if it's not already made up?  And your telling me that you don't offer egg whites in a cafe with an extensive breakfast menu?  I really hate it when people engage in deceptive tactics regarding trivial matters ... Clearly the breakfast burritos here are most likely pre-made frozen store bought items, yet this dishonest establishment is trying to claim the food is not pre-made in advance... Despite admitting that they make everything in the morning????  If you tell me that you make your food in the morning, then your food isn't made fresh to-order .... DUH   Bottom line is do not lie to your potential patrons because it's very easy to claim to offer fresh food, but if you don't allow any substitutions or allow people to order food how they want it prepared... it is clear that there is something shady/scheming going on here.  I would never recommend a place like this to anyone, and I would recommend all to stay away from dishonest food establishments like this ... Selling people pre-made frozen breakfast burritos and misleadingly claiming that the ingredients/food items were cooked in the morning is just deceiving and nasty.  When I go to a bakery/cafe I expect fresh food made to order the way I want it ... I don't need or want to eat frozen pre-made foods.  Even if it was \"cooked\" in the morning - that is still unacceptable, and definitely not what I am looking for.... No thank you!"}
{"text":"Great Asian-style cakes with fruit topping -- not too sweet.  Awesome pastries, e.g. BBQ pork bun, coffee bun.  It is probably the best Asian bakery in Chandler, AZ."}
{"text":"I got a chocolate mousse cake for a birthday. I went into the shop the day before I needed the cake, and the girl there was very nice and helpful. Easy process, and they had the cake ready for us early the next day. I thought the cake itself was OK, the moose was good, but I didn't really think the cake itself was that good. The other people at the party thought the cake was pretty good."}
{"text":"Best bakery in town if your looking for a fruit cake. What I love about Donnas fruit cake is that the cake isn't too sweet and the breading was nice and moist. Everything about the cake seems perfectly balance. Also the presentation came out great the lettering on the cake came out spectacular. I was expecting the tacky squeezable red edible writing on the cake but this was beyond my expectations.   I will be coming back for more cakes!"}
{"text":"Nice Little Food and Treats Spot!  I had a nice bacon breakfast croissant for $3.79   I had a large coffee and hung out an it to drink it.   The service was friendly  The place was clean  Limited seating inside, but there is a table outside.   They have free wifi"}
{"text":"An ideal place for an unmemorable meal.   Friendly, quick, clean, inexpensive and uninspired."}
{"text":"Really great place!!! It's like a diamond in the rough never expected the food to be so good. Service is fast even when it's packed . The ladies are so nice and friendly really helpful A+"}
{"text":"Impressions to the eyes always meets the mouth 2 fold. If it looks good, it's got to taste that good as well. Most places just show you a fancy picture and when the food comes out its blah. But Donna's is completely different. What you see on the picture boards is exactly what you see on the plate. I swear they just photocopy the food. And that's just the start of your foodie adventure.   You have great desserts, looks like master chef had a tournament in there. Everything so delicate and just melts perfectly in your mouth. I have to say I was most overjoyed to be able to not only see how great it looks but Wow taste it for once."}
{"text":"Quality family owned bakery and cafe and my go-to for Asian style fruit Cakes that are delicious and healthy because they are low in sugar. While I have only checked in twice on Yelp I've been to this shop at least a dozen times to grab cakes and snacks for birthdays, new jobs, births, cake throwing contests. I rely on them for the fluffy angel food style cakes with whipped cream (not frosting) and fresh fruit filling. They are Chinese owned so the cakes are also a hit for Chinese parties as they can write your fav Chinese message on the cake.   However ....  This last time I got a chocolate fruit cake versus the regular white cake fruit. We were slightly disappointed because the cake just didn't have that chocolateY taste. Also they outside side of the cake was covered in chocolate sprinkles but the sprinkles weren't actually chocolate (we think) and it made our cake taste a little odd and waxy. We also weren't asked about whether we wanted the sprinkles. I've never had sprinkles on the cakes before (but I suppose it goes with the Chocolate Fruit Cake??) so I didn't realize they were going to be there. I only found out when I arrived to pick it up. I'd recommend real chocolate shavings for the future.   Donna's offers other options for the toppings surrounding the side of the cake like toasted almonds, walnuts, coconut shreds that is an extra $3 dollars. So it might be worth asking the customer when he makes the order if he'd like them (upsell opportunity anyways) as I think these cakes would taste nice with almonds surrounding the side of it!"}
{"text":"Various selection of artisan breads. Desserts and cakes mos def affordable.  Great for breakfast sandwiches and burritos. Also, lunch sandwiches on point. Bookmark this spot for a visit."}
{"text":"OHMYGOODNESS! Great prices, great sandwich, AMAZING service-very clean little place but very well hidden. You have to *really* look but do yourself a favor and check it out-so. amazing."}
{"text":"I love Donna's!  I drove past one early morning and saw the open sign and thought \"what the heck, I should check it out.\"  Donna's has the most delicious looking pastries.  I recently had a party and I ordered my cake here.  It pleased the masses and everyone wanted to know where I got my cake from.  They also serve up some quick breakfast sandwiches and an assortment of readymade breakfast burritos - the potatoes are always cooked to perfection, something that must be hard for other places to grasp because I've had plenty of half cooked potatoes in my breakfast burritos.  Donna's knows what's up."}
{"text":"Love this little sandwich shop! They have the best daily specials! Fresh food.  Quick service! This is my Monday lunch shop! The macaroons are amazing too!!"}
{"text":"I had just finished shopping at the dispensary next door when I saw the window ads outside that caught my eye, I couldn't resist and decided let's try this place out.  I ordered a honeydew and pineapple smoothie and let's just say it was AWFUL. At first I regretted my smoothie combination but I soon realized that it was just WAY TOO SWEET. I also order a club sandwich on white bread... I threw that out too... I spent $11 and left still thirsty and twice as hungry."}
{"text":"This is actually a review of their Phoenix location which recently opened in COFCO plaza.  I've never been to any other location.   Their food/cakes/breads are simply amazing. I honestly consider this new location a slice of baked heaven. They are open until 7:30, the food is always fresh, everything tastes wonderful and the recipes are always consistent.   I tried a sandwich, a chicken wrap and a strawberry smoothie today. All of them were beyond delicious!  I'm a huge fan of their Hong Kong Milk Tea as well.  Their customer service is phenomenal. The girl who is always working there is very sweet and remembers her customers. I hope that it brings more business to the slowly dying COFCO plaza.   I'm sure the bakery inside Super L is pissed - and they should be. They have some heavy competition. ;)"}
{"text":"(1)This store has the worst customer service ever. I went there waited for at least 15 mins and no one said hi to me. Only one lady worked there was talking to other two customers about their customized birthday cake. I was totally ignored, until they went to register and I asked anyone who worked here?  She said I will be back with you after I finish this.. Still, cold and wasting time (2)Their drink is not tasty at all.. and over priced. I would never go back there."}
{"text":"IMPORTANT CONTEXT  I signed up for Yelp in 2010, but wasn't active until a few months ago, when I decided to try Yelp to search for new places to get breakfast. I read a lot of reviews, tried some of the suggestions, and found some hits and misses.   Donna's Bakery Cafe was one of the misses.  To be fair, I think that my expectations were too high based on what the words \"bakery\" and \"café\" mean to me. When I think of a bakery, I envision cases filled with fresh baked, delicately decorated treats. When I think of a café, I envision a cute coffee house, filled with people sipping various versions of delicious smelling coffees. Donna's Bakery Café is nothing at all like that.  SERVICE EXPERIENCE  Donna's Bakery Café is in a nondescript strip mall. Walking in, I noticed it was nice and clean, but I honestly wasn't even sure I was in the right place by the reviews I had read, and the fact that it was completely empty. I asked the woman behind the counter for the breakfast menu. All of the menu items are listed on the wall. (see pic) I picked the chorizo breakfast burrito and a coffee, paid and looked at some of the treats they had for sale. (see pics) I waited for what seemed like a long time for such a simple order. Finally, I received my breakfast in a brown paper bag. My burrito was pretty dry and tasteless, but filling. My coffee was ok. Now that I know what to expect, I wouldn't be so disappointed if I ate here again.  DONNA'S BAKERY CAFE  Since my visit, I learned that Donna's Bakery Café is extremely well known for their specialty cakes, which are inspired by Asian styles, with their own unique cake recipes that are one of a kind. They specialize in fruit and mousse cakes, which are less sweet than the traditional American cakes. Although I have never tried them, they look amazing and I would definitely try one if I had a special event.   CONCLUSION  So, Donna's Bakery Café isn't really my type of breakfast hangout, but may well be my go to bakery for beautiful hand made specialty cakes. I'll be sure to let you know!  3/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Catering is available.  *There is plenty of parking out front:  *HOURS: Mon-Sat: 8am-6pm Sun: 10am-2pm  *For more information: donnasbakerycafe.com"}
{"text":"It was lunch time and drove by Donnas Bakery Café and in my head I though,,,oooohhhh cupcakes, must get a cupcake before going back to the office, so when I entered Donnas I was a little taken back because it was not quite what I had envisioned in my head for it to be, but what I did find made me happy!  This isn't a typical American bakery which I mistook it for, but its more Asian/European, they do have fresh breads, pastries, cakes and other deserts and drinks, but they also have this menu with these amazing sounding sandwiches, I think I have found a new place to try for a sandwich, and the prices are killer!   I did order a slice of Tiramisu, it was perfectly presently and wrapped and just begging for me to buy it and devour it up and it was less than 2.50, can't be that!  Took it back to the office and the cake was the perfect thing I had to been craving, so yea I didn't walk away with a cupcake, but I did get a great tasting piece of Tiramisu, so no losers here!   Now I have to go back to try the sandwiches and happy to add Donnas Café to my lunch time places!"}
{"text":"This is my #1 work lunch destination. Simple sandwiches on delicious bread... Every day there is a lunch special - so sandwich plus a bag of chips and a drink for ((((drum roll)))) 3.99$. Yeah, you heard me right. With tax, the total is 4.31$ but that's still REALLY good, pretty unheard of.  In addition to the awesome sandwiches there are GREAT pastries and desserts. Honestly, they remind me of home (Seattle) - that had a great International District.  Five stars, Donna's Bakery, keep on being awesome!"}
{"text":"I have always gotten amazing food from them but this morning my breakfast sandwich came with an added surprise... HAIR is my scrambled eggs. I will not be going back to Donnas. Pretty sad because I work for a huge company right around the corner. I will be networking at how unhygienic is place is."}
{"text":"It's the best cake I ever had! Not too sweet like fry's cake or walmart cake! They have different flavors as well and they even had a durian flavor."}
{"text":"I've been eating lunch at Donna's for about ten months now - since I started working around the corner. Paul, who is generally manning the front counter knows me by name, makes great, honest suggestions and notices when I've had a hair cut - what a guy!   I frequently find I don't really have time to actually take a lunch, but with Donna's a mere two minutes from my office, and free wi-fi in the dining area, I often pack up my laptop for an hour or so midday, enjoy a sandwich and keep up with the ever present flow of emails - or ignore work entirely and write reviews on Yelp - which is what I am doing now. On site review!   This little bakery is a fantastic place to get a sandwich. On my way in to the shop each visit I check out the blackboard at the door, which shows you the daily $3.99 special. For that super low price you get the sandwich of the day (today it was a roast beef with pickles - my favorite is the chicken walnut salad), a bag of chips and a small (refillable) drink. If whatever is on the blackboard doesn't quite spark your interest, the shop has a decent sized list of other cold sandwiches for purchase. The sandwiches are made on fresh bread made by the bakery - which you can purchase and take home for around $2.50 for a (rather large) half loaf.   Beyond making some of the best red velvet cupcakes in town - they are a STEAL at $1.29 (I just paid $4 for one somewhere else), the shop also offers lots of traditional pastries including cinnamon and Danish rolls and a variety of cakes for purchase by the slice or in whole for a party. I love that in addition to these more familiar items Donna's also offers unique items like green tea pastries and bean tarts.   With the service, pricing and great food and pastry selection I plan to keep up my current 3-day-a-week custard bun habit as long as my waistline will allow."}
{"text":"Thank you Donna for helping us get our turtle themed cake for moms 70th birthday!! You are so creative and the cake was delicious!!! Really appreciate all you did! Thank you!"}
{"text":"this is a very very very nice place.  Go there quite often as I work close. They have some stuff here I havent found elsehwere..  Bubble Tea and Hong Kong Milk Tea.  Very Nice and unusual.    House made pastries.   yummy  Killer Breakfast Burritos.  Pricing is really good at this place too.  The people I know who go there keep going because it just a great place to have close by.  Probably go get a turkey sausage or chorizo burrito tomorrow..."}
{"text":"What a little hidden gem! We had our car breakdown and were at Napa next door. They recommended we grab a sandwich from Donna's - said it was amazing! Boy were they right! I just got a simple turkey and ham sandwich but it was on Japanese style white bread. I'm not sure what makes it different but it was sweet and delicious!   Walked in right before 2pm on a Sunday before they closed and they were able to squeeze us in. Very night people working there.   They sell quite a bit of pastries/cakes/cupcakes/breads/cookies/etc. there that looked so good! I wish I would have bought some but we were in a rush. I would definitely go back there if I wanted to get lunch/breakfast or order some yummy pastries!"}
{"text":"This hidden bakery/ sandwich shop is so good, and needs to be popularized! The girls that work here are beautiful and so friendly. The breakfast sandwich is perfect as well as their chicken teriyaki. Don't hesitate to buy a loaf of their signature bread. It's hard to stop buying stuff here :)"}
{"text":"Excellent pinapple bread buns and white bread.   Easy strong bakery staples for those looking for Hong Kong styled buns.  The selections are very slim however, but what they do offer looks tasty and positively appealing.  It's cheaper than most other asian bakeries, and the cafe is nice and clean.  I haven't bothered with the sandwiches, because the pictures do not look appetizing.  Their boba milk tea is expensive, but it's good.  Not too sweet, not too bitter, and the boba has a good chewy texture to it.  It's a good place to grab and run, but I would not bother with dining here."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast burritos! And they're so cheap too. Get a couple and thank me later :). The mousse cakes taste amazing as well"}
{"text":"Had a tiffany's cake made for my birthday as a surprise. It looked really pretty and the color was spot on. The cake was really good and loved the light frosting they put on!"}
{"text":"We went to Donna's couple of times. The rating is based on only Tiramisu, Chocolate mousse, Mango mousse cake. All of them were excellent. Soft and no extra sugary. The cake is always fresh. You have to come early to get the Chocolate Mousse cake. The only bad thing is it closes at 6pm. Would bw great to have it open until 8/9pm."}
{"text":"I was able to order a 6\" bday cake and they were able to make it that same day, that's rare in some bakeries they usually need a day or weeks head notice. I got the taro with fresh fruit. The taro was freshly pureed with bits of starchy texture but that's the consistently of it. The fruit was good but gets soggy the next day so try to eat it all within the same day. The cake was kinda dry, was hoping for a moist cake but the taro being on point made up for it. My favorite part was the cream on the outside, not icing but almost tastes like homemade cool whip."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Unusual, for me anyway, but always enjoy trying something different. I've never ordered anything from here but what they have on the shelves has been tasty and fresh. We've had breakfast or lunch her on a few occasions and that's good.  Nothing fancy though. One thing about this place is it's very small.  Like maybe two tables that seat four and maybe a two top too."}
{"text":"One of the workers was super friendly and helpful! We were there for a whole hour trying to decide what design for the cake we should have. The worker was not frustrated and annoyed by us at all. The cake came out beautifully as well. They were also able to make the cake with only 24hrs notice."}
{"text":"Whenever there is a birthday or celebration, I ALWAYS get my cakes here. Cakes are excellent and they are always on time and I've never had any issues with their cakes. They never mess up the spelling or message. I've gotten cakes from here at least 10 times and each time is was worth it!  I can't comment on the breads or sandwiches as I've never had them."}
{"text":"My favorite bakery to order a cake from for any occasion!  Donna and her employees have always been super sweet and helpful with whatever I need. Whether I order the cake 1 week in advance or 6 hours in advance, the cake has always been made to look visually appealing, as well as delicious. I have tried several different flavors: tiramisu, vanilla, and chocolate mousse. All of these have had their basic whipped cream topping with fresh fruits. The cake is very fresh, light, and not overly sweet. It's a different taste than the one's you will order at a grocery store bakery.  They can write whatever you want on the cake. I've ordered writing in both English and Chinese.   I highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been working nearby for almost 3 years, and for months would see a steady stream of coworkers heading over to grab a breakfast burrito. After a while I decided to give it a try myself. Honestly I never saw what all of the hype was about, but for $2 it was a nice routine in the morning. Now that they've doubled the price, I doubt I'll be returning."}
{"text":"11/03/10  A close coworker and good friend recommended I try Donna's Bakery many, many months ago (maybe even a year ago, whenever it was that it first opened-- the owners are close family friends of hers).  This visit was a spur-of-the-moment decision-- a rare thing for me as I like to do some legwork first before I try a new place.  I even texted my friend for directions and DB's phone number so I could inquire if they were still even open for business that evening!  The young clerk I met there was very friendly and accomodating-- answering most of my questions w/ firm authority, and when he didn't know the answer, especially that concerning of the large fruit-topped birthday cake in the display case, he'd pop into the kitchen and ask someone for the answer.  I soon met the affable Mr. of Donna's Bakery, who informed me that the Mrs.- Donna- had to leave town that evening, but not before making the very cake I had a fixation on that very morning!  I hadn't planned on making such a purchase, esp. since Mom already had a birthday pass, but he made the cake sound so healthy (made w/ all-natural ingredients-- no powdered sugar, cornstarch, or corn syrup!  The fruits were brushed w/ a tapioca-fruit juiced glaze.  I don't think it even had eggs in the batter!), and topped with fresh, sliced fruits (w/ the exception of the maraschino cherries) AND filled w/ more fruit inside!  After selecting a few pastries to take home: a slice of German chocolate-mousse cake; a couple of red-velvet cupcakes w/ icing topped w/ red velvet cake crumbles (!); and something akin to an almond slivered-topped and flattened mocha cream puff (not pictured), Mr. Donna kindly offered a 10% discount on the cake.  Still hesitant in purchasing such a big item I hadn't had a chance to sample, I splurged and brought the cake home.    None of the smaller items wowed me (I found the cakes' texture to be very tender, yet lacking in moisture- strange), but that birthday cake was very, very good!  The layers were made of angel cake, and I LOVED the fruit-and-cream filling the most!  Mom didn't think much of the slice she had, but she was going through a period of a few months when she wasn't craving anything sweet, which was a good thing!  So, I sliced the rest of the cake and brought it to work-- everyone who had caved in to the temptation loved it.  Some even had seconds and thirds!!  I plan on going back to try a few savory items that sounded good on the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious and beautiful Asian-style cakes.  The cake is fresh, soft, and spongy, and the toppings of fresh fruit really liven up the design of the cakes.  I have had slices and a special made to order cake, and everything I have ordered has been superb."}
{"text":"Was next door at the surgery center and needed breakfast bad.  Since it was the crack of dawn the place was empty however that didn't stop the great service I got.  Cashier was so nice!  Had a smile on her face the whole time and have me good recommendation for what I was looking for to eat.  That's nice.  Ordered a breakfast burrito that was AWESOMMMMME.  I also had a Carmel iced coffee and that was great as well. I was worried due to the other reviews and glad it was yummy.  It's not called Donna s any longer.  Boba subs or something like that.  Nevertheless I would come here again."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was pretty good. The Danish was very very good.  Very flaky and the cream cheese center was delicious!  The pineapple bun was not to my liking.  I will have to stick with BBQ buns and such from here when I want Asian buns... To that ends, I can say Donna's Asian buns are downright divine and the price is right for sampling... Get your hands on her buns as soon as you can..."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but not sure i'll be back for lunch.  the baked goods are phenomenal but the new staff isn't as nice and friendly as the old staff.  doesn't help that they made me the wrong sandwich and charged me for a much more expensive one."}
{"text":"This is a bakery that also serves sandwiches and soups.  Seating inside is very limited - only a few tables.   This is more of a grab and go place.  The sandwich creation I had was EXCELLENT - turkey w/cranberry.  Much better than the cafe down the street.  Check it out for lunch."}
{"text":"Have been here on numerous occasions and have always been back.   Food: Cakes are delicious, fresh and a wide variety.  Atmosphere: Cozy and stocked with plenty of wonderful different cakes and pastries  Service: Helpful and friendly.   The lunch is also quite delicious and affordable."}
{"text":"I thought the ladies at the front were super sweet and very helpful...The food my daughter and I did get was very good and great prices!! However, I give 3 stars because we arrived at 8:45 am and they were out of almost everything in their front case. I was a little disappointed in that and though I knew from other reviews, that the Asian pastries were available and good - I didn't realize that it's all they make...so if you like Asian flavors, coconut, mango, banana and vanilla, this is a great place! My daughters egg sausage sand which was made with \"white wonder bread\" - not probably our first choice"}
{"text":"Went looking for a quick bite away from my hotel across the street and found Donna's behind the Chinese Cultural Center, right next to the Ranch Market.  Actually, this was a very nice little mom and pop cafe. Karla was in there alone and was very friendly and had a smile when she took my order. I had a veggie wrap and it was very good.  Fresh tortilla and included in the sandwich was a touch of cranberries, which were delicious. Excellent meal for less than 8 bucks. And it's always good to see someone who smiles and is friendly when working in the public sector."}
{"text":"Their food is fantastic and their prices are low. It's a tiny place and the owners/staff are great. I work nearby and haven't taken full advantage - I just discovered it shortly after deciding to diet. Their breakfast burritos are amazing and cheap. Their delicious pastries make the place smell like a real bakery. It's been a really long time since I've been to a decent bakery in Phoenix. I may write more later, but that's all I've got right now... so tough beans. Go eat there."}
{"text":"Slow service and bad food! When I heard about this place I was so excited to try it cuz I totally missed good Asian bakery. I was there yesterday and ordered black pepper beef sandwich and they told me they were out of beef. Then I asked if they had curry buns they told they didn't make them anymore. Then I decided to order teriyaki chicken sandwich and it was too salty. I also bought coconut buns and it tasted old and stale. Their milk tea was so chalky and nasty. It kinda made me sick & nauseous after taking few sips I tossed it out. Every freaking thing I ordered was pretty bad and gross. Never going back to that place again."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch. It was cool to see so many things on the menu.. Breakfast sandwiches, breakfast burritos, and sandwiches.   I had been in previously just for Asian baked goods. The jelly roll and pork buns were good.   Today I tried the turkey club on a croissant and the milk tea. The sandwich was okay/decent. It definitely didn't look as nice as the picture on the wall though... The milk tea was quite..... different/not what milk tea should taste like. I've had milk tea in many different places, even Montana lol. I would steer clear of it. Or maybe it was a really bad day? Either way, I fully regret getting a large....   The staff and owner were really nice and polite!"}
{"text":"I work near by and have had stopped in here for lunch several times. Always delicious and always a great experience.  This is a small store front with an extremely courteous staff and just plain great food! Sandwiches made to order... bread (especially the croissants) with so much flavor and baked just right! And price wise... a much better deal or at least comparable to the famous chain sandwich shops (Subway... bleh!).  A few weeks ago a coworker mentioned that they also have breakfast so being that I had my staff working on a Saturday I agreed to buy breakfast... HUGE sandwiches with eggs, cheese and a meat (bacon, pork sausage or turkey sausage.) all on your choice of bread... All for as little as $1.99 (50 cents extra for a croissant.) So yummy and so filling! This was a big hit with the staff for sure and really... I got off pretty cheap considering that we fed a total 8 people for right around $20. Much cheaper than the local burrito place and better food then hitting the local drive thru!  Now on to the desserts... WOW! Passion Fruit mousse cake!!! My personal favorite...Awesome! Not to sweet but definitely worth splurging those extra calories.  Tony (the manager) and his staff are always extremely friendly, courteous and willing to help questions and suggestions.   Definitely recommend this place..."}
{"text":"I have ordered 3 cakes from this bakery and have to say that they are absolutely amazing!  I have just ordered another for a friend and cannot wait for everyone to try it !   Get the fresh fruit cake for any special occasion !   You will love it!   I haven't dined in the cafe."}
{"text":"Having recently moved to Arizona from the Bay Area, I was desperate to find an Asian bakery where I could get my weekly serving of bbq pork buns, red bean buns, and egg tarts!   My waiter at C-Fu directed me here, so I gave it a try with high hopes.  Unfortunately, Donna's Bakery Cafe cannot even compare to the places my family used to frequent in San Francisco Chinatown, or even the chain bakeries in California.  Even though Asian pastries are known for being satisfying without being too sweet, these pastries were not sweet enough.  Donna's supplies pastries to many of the Asian markets in the area, which probably reflects the fact that standards are low here.  I would say that Donna's does a much better job of being a \"cafe\" than a \"bakery\" because their sandwiches are very good.  The ingredients in the turkey avocado sandwich were fresh and tasty.  And I loved how she neatly assembled the sandwich so that it wasn't messy to eat!"}
{"text":"Another unique gem in the east valley. I stopped in here one day for lunch on a recommendation. The special of the day was chicken salad, chips and drink for $4.99. Good deal. Bread is homemade and was delicious and fresh, only suggestion would be, add more filling, I would not even have minded to have paid and extra buck for another spoon ful of chicken salad. Got a red velvet cupcake for dessert to take back to the office. Nice and moist with buttercream frosting. I have been looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"We found Donna's by chance one day. I love Asian bakeries, so I was very excited. Since then, I've liked everything that I've tried. The prices are reasonable and the people very helpful. Their Hawaiian sandwich is amazing."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch, which had a pretty good selection and great prices. We were not impressed however by the selection of pastry items. Most were prepackaged, and they only had a few cakes in the glass display. I would recommend for a casual lunch, but not if you are planning on also having dessert."}
{"text":"Awful food and service!  I always try a place twice before I write a review so I gave this place two chances and it is an unorganized mess.  It took 38 min to get the wrong sandwich TWICE.  There were two girls making the sandwiches and handing them to the poor girl at the register who clearly was a newbie.  They would hand her the sandwiches and say here....when she would ask what they were they would look annoyed and roll their eyes.  The poor girl was just trying to make sure the right order went out the the right people.  Also for this being a bakery why was my bread nasty and stale both times??? Super gross.  My bread tasted like it was a week old.  The first time I had the Turkey avocado sandwich which was BATHED in mayo.  The second time I had the club which had mayo all over the outside of the sandwich in globs and the bacon appeared to be semi-raw.....not thanks....do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here at least twice a week. They have daily special sandwiches that come with a drink and chips or a cookie. It's a deal that can't be beat! The staff is really friendly too! Come on a Thursday, the classic Italian sandwich special is probably the best sandwich I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Donna's to get all my Asian and western style baked goods.  While the cupcakes and cakes are delicious, the Asian pastries like the BBQ pork bun are even yummier!    As someone who enjoys whipped cream versus the sugary buttercream frosting, I love how everything isn't too sweet.  A slice of cake is just the perfect ending to a day filled with packing up Christmas decorations!  I adore the mango mousse cake and the tiramisu is quite delicious as well.  Yummy!  When I got married, I had Donna do my three-tiered cake and everybody complimented on how moist and flavorful it was.  We did the bottom and top tier as tiramisu and the middle as mango mousse.  We did the tradition of keeping the top tier to eat a year later and I had thought the mango mousse would grow moldy since fruit has more water content so when we sliced into our tiramisu cake, it was actually still fresh and delicious.  Wow!  It could've been the millions of layering we did with saran wrap and foil but I was super surprised.  And no tummyache afterward!  We even brought some of the cake to both our parents so they can celebrate with us.  I love Donna's Bakery!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and was in the mood for a boba smoothie, so I drove into the Chinese Cultural Center to see if I could get one there.  I saw this place and SCORE, they have boba smoothies.  Unfortunately, that was the highlight of my experience.  The smoothie itself was poorly made (way too runny) and the taste was off.  I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend an Arizona bakery more highly than Donna's Bakery & Cafe. Not only do they prepare beautifully executed and meticulously designed cakes, but they do so with an unparalleled love and generosity, which is so often absent in businesses. Donna's went out of their way to make my Christmas cake everything that I had wanted it to be and more. Their patience and talent are evident in their beautiful cakes, and I would never buy a cake anywhere else in the Phoenix area. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Just stopped for expresso. Everyone very friendly and helpful. There is outside seating and this is where I enjoyed my two shots of Expresso. If I am in the area I would stop again as their Expresso is good."}
