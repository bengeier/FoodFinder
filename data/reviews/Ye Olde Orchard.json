{"text":"This is the perfect Irish pub for me!!! It has everything you can expect from such a place. Most of the staff there have for sure irish blood in their vein. There is good beer (a good variety), good food, good music and a very festive mood!  But most of all for me the cherry on top of the sunday was the amount of screens showing ice hockey games lol. Since I'm a big fan of ice hockey, this bar offers me all I can dream of. Next time you're in Montreal give it a try!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite local pubs, Ye Olde Orchard's Prince-Arthur location actually improves upon its original Monkland Village spot. All the food is excellent, and I highly recommend substituting the sweet potato fries since they're delicious. A good selection of local and imported beers on tap. There are pub quizzes, regular live music, and all the Habs games on the big screen with sound, plus some Euro, World Cup and select Premier League football matches. The waiters all wear kilts and the service is friendly as. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Felt like some pub food while in Montreal and found this place near to where I'm staying. 

Atmosphere is pretty chill and the music is great (if you like classic rock).  Service is mediocre (waiter forgot my soup), but they have some good beers on tap (house lager is pretty tasty) so I call it even.  I had the steak and mushroom pie and a baked potato which hit the spot.  Not out of this world but what I expected. 

I would come back, but would order something else. The burgers looked really good.

I gave them a 4, but if I could have I would rate them at 3.5. 



I would probably come back"}
{"text":"Saturday night, downtown Montreal, 2 and a half hours before Leafs vs Habs.  Ye Olde Orchard Pub had a great atmosphere and was lively with a mixed crowd of fans from both teams. Easily found within a couple of blocks of The Bell Center (le centre Bell).  The three guys in our group were seated without delay and beverages were ordered and delivered within 5 minutes of our arrival. Wait staff was knowledgeable about bar menu items and spoke French and English with ease as 2 of us at the table were not bilingual.  A very good assortment of beers available, both bottled and on tap. Wait staff was able to answer questions about varieties inlc local, domestic and imports. The selection was good.  Food order followed shortly after our bevies arrived. Food menu was impressive with a wide assortment of pub foods and classic restaraunt options - all were reasonably priced.  Our group ordered burgers and BLT's accompanied by poutine.  My menu selection also came with choice of soup or salad and I opted for French onion soup, which was thick and brothy and very tasty.  All menu choices we chose were very good. We all exchanged comments and everyone seemed happy with their choice.  One of the other guys picked up the tab, so I'm not sure what the final tally was, but nothing on the menu struck me as over-priced.  I would say 3 guys with a beverage each plus pub fare and tip was probably around $80.00-$90.00. Overall a great experience at a good price. If you're disappointed with your experience at this place, you're probably the fussy type or you unfortunately experienced a server at a good pub who was having a bad night."}
{"text":"Okay drinks, but what's up with the service? We gave a five dollar tip for a couple of drinks (what amounted to be a 25% tip), and the waitress made a very angry, displeased face at us and wouldn't leave until we gave her more money. My boyfriend threw in a toonie on top of our $5 and she just frowned, snatched it, and left without saying a customary \"thank you\" or \"have a nice night.\" This bar is nice, generally quiet, and is an overall fine Irish pub - but as someone who used to be a waitress myself, this was beyond unprofessional. I would never have acted this way towards a customer. Ever. 

Beware - this is a great bar if you want to give generally slow and uninvolved staff a 40%+ tip so they don't lash out at you. Otherwise, it's just ho hum."}
{"text":"Bonne place avant un show au Centre Bell.  Malheureusement le menu à changé, et mon dessert préféré est disparu (gros gâteau au chocolat avec sauce au caramel)...  
On va espérer..."}
{"text":"An Irish pub that offers a consistently great experience. The last time I went they still didn't have a full liquor license, so you had to order a meal with your beer but that's never been a problem considering the pub fare they serve is above the norm. On different days of the week you'll get to experience bar trivia and great live bands with some decent acoustics in the place. I've always had great service from their friendly staff."}
{"text":"Trivia night on Monday nights is the best in the city and I've been to a lot! The host is funny and (almost more importantly) efficient. He also gets creative with the format of questions too. Really good service overall. Get the $5 beer on tap and the naan pizza."}
{"text":"Very very good bar. Service is great, and so is the menu. Quiet happy hours during the week and live bands on the weekend so you get the best of both worlds. Enjoy the beer selection as well."}
{"text":"The food is above average pub food. The beer list is not extensive and improvements could be made here. The service is great. A lovely pub all around but it is in the basement, dark, dank, tight, and loud. Good pub all around."}
{"text":"Great food for a pub place. Excellent choice for lunch as well. They always have daily specials. The service is fast and friendly and the food is reasonably priced, good portions and very tasty. I had the regular hamburger the last time I was there but the jerk chicken over coconut rice looked amazing good."}
{"text":"Good wings and they have a good variety of styles/flavours. The service from the waitresses could be better. We waited a long time to even get our order taken. I would have also liked some refills but we were only checked on once early on into our meal. I would go back for beers and wings."}
{"text":"I went to this place because of the convenient location-- but was really impressed with the pub food.  It is definitely above and beyond what you would expect.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a drink, watch a game and hangout. The drinks, food, service and atmosphere are all excellent"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this Olde Orchard location because its food is excellent (I adore their burgers and onion soup) and its beer selection impressive.

As with other Olde Orchard locations the food ranges from pub fare to burgers, steaks and curries. I stick to the burger section and have never been disappointed.

Beer-wise, I prefer the local brews to the imported ones. They are cheaper (even more so at happy hour, which runs until 7-ish IIRC) and stimulate the local economy. My picks are the Cream Ale, Apricot Wheat and Griffon Rousse. In the imported section I dig Smithwick's, Newcastle Brown and Cidre du Minot cider. It is excellent.

The wait staff are always great and help create a good mood. They will gladly recommend your next tipple if you're undecided.

I love this place, and so should you."}
{"text":"Nice interior. Decent beer selection on tap. Nice service. 

Food is good quality pub grub but I would say pretty expensive. 

I heard great things about their curry but was a bit dissapointed, might have ordered to wrong thing.  For $17 it tasted like the jar of curry sauce you buy in the grocery shop.

I would say that its a decent place but you are looking at $25 for a meal and a pint, which is kind of a lot."}
{"text":"Un endroit \"old style\" correct pour prendre une bière et un snack. Mais la nourriture est ordinaire. Nous avons essayer le fish'n chips et le steak-frite. C'était correct sans plus."}
{"text":"Exactly what you expect from a Irish pub: good food, friendly staff, relaxed vibe.

A few items worth trying:
- their burgers
- their curries
- and their Irish Toast at brunch (French toast made with Bailey's)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I chose this place over a fancy restaurant. We were greeted at the door with great hospitality. We got seated and it was very busy but the gentleman got our order. I asked to sub the fries for rice and he got me fries instead or he must've not heard me. I got strip steak but it was very chewy. Overall this place was great! My boyfriend enjoyed his 10 oz steak. The best part was sharing his 10 oz steak."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Came here for lunch while visiting the city. The service was great. Got the fish and chips, which was super tasty. Friends got two of the curries and the hamburger steak, all were very happy.

We ended up coming back the next day for dinner. Everyone got fish and chips since it was so yummy the first time around. 

Check it out for sure!"}
{"text":"This pub is right around the corner from our place, and I feel very blessed about that. It has a cozy authentic pub feel (not commercial). It looks a bit rustic with big wood floors and custom-made bar tables along the side. It feels buzzling and busy without being to loud. Obviously it is great for watching games with all the screens but I like coming here for the food too. I mostly eat from the Pub menu which has meat pie, Irish Stew, steak and Guiness pie - all warming wintery foods that I eat year round. I have also had some sandwish there, it was comme ci comme ca. Lots of food for the money actually. 
On Thursdays they have a band that plays Rockabilly, it is quite groovy. They have pub quiz one night which doesn't sound very exiting to me but had some friends mesmerized for hours. Think it was a Wednesday."}
{"text":"Classic underground pub in the heart of Montreal right across from the Novotel hotel. Decent collection of whiskey, pretty commercial beer selection. The food is good. It gets busy after habs games as it's near the Bell centre and occasionally has some live music. 

I had a good time here sitting at the bar for three nights. They always have some hockey game on. All three nights had a wide mix of demographic in ages. Would definitely go back next time in Montreal!"}
{"text":"All I can say is the food is very good, and a fan of their pub style. 

But the wait staff,......phew! really need to work on them. I had some very bad service here. Those kilts sure don't help them be better at their job. I've been here many times, and the last time i went was from a waitress who really needs an attitude change. 

The only reason I'm giving 3 stars and being nice is because the food is great and don't want to take away the whole restaurants integrity just based on the wait staff."}
{"text":"It is a good place to stop for a beer.  It is on a side street so is quieter and has open seating facing the street which is very nice.  They have beer specials so just ask.  It is a small pub.  Waitress wears a kilt and is friendly.  Food is nothing special just pub food.  Has 3 tv screens.  Has a genuine pub feel to the place with stone walls.  I would return."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Good beers, burger was fantastic and the curries were heart warming. The service was typical Montreal, take that as you see fit."}
{"text":"First and last visit. Decided to sample their fish and chips as it seemed to be a typical dish on a pub menu. Three fair portions of fish with rather cool tasteless fries. All in all, the fish plate at $16 was not memorable, the fries were cold. The beer ($7.83) was excellent though. Service was OK, but cold. Not an experience  I would care to repeat or recommend. Felt cheated out of $30.40 (including tip)."}
{"text":"Well this was a second time after a rather long time. On Saint Patrick day about 11pm we decided to have dinner and a beer in an Irish  bar! There wad a line at the entrance. It was terribly cold outside. We were told it takes an hour to get a table for six. Almost disappointed, few minutes later, just when we were leaving, the guy called us in and said
he has a table for us. Guess what, there were many free tables
Whether the guy was joking or not we had a lot of fin. A pint of Guinness, beef pie with mashed potato and great company. What else do you need?!
I recommend the place, but insist to get in if you were told the bar is full"}
{"text":"The Waitress (a girl working at night on 8th,june) are horrible. She was the rudest waitress I've ever seen. She totally messed up our night. She doesn't deserve to get any tips and do that work. I hope she meets a same waitress when she get any restaurants. 
Except her, this pub is cool."}
{"text":"Came here for a cards against humanity tournament with friends. The place was packed for a hockey night. They had drink specials going on until 7 pm- draft beers and house wine (5 oz) for 6$. I ordered the chicken wings (1/2 portion) with fries and a veggie platter= definition of bar food.
I had a good time though- seating was ideal for game night!"}
{"text":"We went before a Habs game. The decor is nice and the kilts add a nice touch. They have some awesome game day specials with pints, wings, and nachos for like 30$. I had the French Onion Soup and a salad. They were pretty good."}
{"text":"Went here to watch football and the service here was great. Our waiter Jordan was great and the food was very good. I will definitely stop here every time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Monkland or St-Sauveur locations but stopped in at this one after a day of gallivanting on the Plateau. It's a little small but they also have a few tables set up outside - perfect for those warm summer days. Well, if we ever get them! 

The service was good, and when asked for a 'birthday drink recommendation,' the waitress suggested one of their 'homemade' creations: the Bourbon lemonade. HELLO! It was served in a pint glass and they weren't cheap on the Bourbon so... no complaints! What I especially like about this location is that it just feels like you can walk in at any time of the day, pick a corner and just chill out without anyone bothering you. Love it. 

I didn't have anything to eat so can't comment on the food. That said, if it's anything like Monkland or St-Sauveur, you've got nothing to worry about. They typically serve food throughout the day, including breakfast/brunch; their menu is quite varied so there's something for everyone - even you veggie lovers :)"}
{"text":"Not my favourite location.

Came for a 5 a 7 and of course to chow down on some wings. We split a plate of a few of them they were meaty and cooked really well. You can pick to have your sauce on the side or the wings tossed in sauce. 

Burger is very big and hearty which was alright but the fries were half cooked and thrown in with older ones which was terrible I couldn't eat them poubelle.

Service was great really nice girl kept coming by every time our beers were done.

Beer... they have no pitchers for 5 a 7 boooo! And the beers they do have $5 are meh. For $6 you can get a shocktop wayyy better.

Nice place nice staff but beers were meh and the french fries were terrible and we later discovered that after eating here we were both sick as it's the only thing we ate that day.

Would come back but just for drinks and wings."}
{"text":"Great service, very polite waitress and server.  Had the curry lamb, was great.  Good beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"Fun staff! 

Nice play to chill and relax after work if you just want a beer or if you want something to eat they have a great menu.

Gets busy on weekends but that's the point lol."}
{"text":"Came here for a happy hour on a Wednesday and it was realllllllly empty. We got a pretty good corner table though so sweet! 

My boyfriend and I only came in to grab an entree and a drink before heading out to do some errands but the food was so good and the service so pleasant that we stayed all evening.

I initially ordered the Caesar salad as an entree and my boyfriend got the onion rings. I enjoyed my salad a lot, it was creamy and crunchy. I didn't like the croutons though but you can just skip those and just eat the salad. The onion rings were good too but I felt they were too soft, I like onion rings really crispy. My boyfriend doesn't so he loved them. He ordered another batch and we got the pound of chicken wings to share and replaced the fries with a side of salad (I wanted more!). We got the wings with the honey garlic sauce. They weren't too spicy but they were a bit too sour for me which was weird. The chicken was really good though so I just scrapped off the sauce. 

I really liked it here, prices were very decent and the server that we had was so nice! I had a great time here and I know I would come again!

The beer for happy hour was 6$ for a pint I believe. The salad as an entree is 6$, onion rings 7$, pound of chicken wings 18$."}
{"text":"Le service est un peu lent, mais la bouffe est bonne, c'est ce qui compte, non? Quoique sur l'heure du dîner un peu de vitesse c'est quand même préférable.
Un pub classique dans un sombre sous-sol. Je vais devoir y retourner lorsque ce sera plus vivant pour me faire une meilleure idée."}
{"text":"Distinguishly appropriate with Newcastle Brown Ale on tap!! I love irish pubs, makes me wanna grow a beard and chop woods. 

Oh! How I blushed when the waiter ask for an ID card! A saturday afternoon with no Habs game, not many patrons. I had the burger. Satisfying but nothing to fancy about. My wife had the irish stew. A comforting bar grub. Although a bit stagnant in tatste. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Awesome pub not far from our crappy bed and breakfast. We walked in here after a long flight from SF and this place was perfect. I was turned on to the St. Ambroise beer at this place and so I had a have a few pints to start my trip to Quebec right!

The food was better than most pub fair in SF. I had the beef and mushroom pie and it was so great, I kept ordering on our future visits here.

They also had a cool cover band (just two dudes - drums and guitar/vocals) which was surprisingly good! I later realized that the music scene in Montreal is a bigger deal than other cities I've been to.

Best of all was the service! Each of the servers (especially the young, darker dude with the permanent 5 o'clock shadow) was very welcoming and professional."}
{"text":"Great pub atmosphere and great beer. Having lived in Boston for 12 years, I'm used to really great pub food. Unfortunately, this place doesn't have it. I had the Sri Lankan curry chicken and my friend had the cajun chicken sandwich. Both were pretty average, if that."}
{"text":"I've been here for football game brunches and for late night beers with friends and I've always had a great experience.

The offer an amazing variety of beer and have decent quality food for a pub. I would describe this pub as \"chill\". It not big as such but that's what gives it a very comfortable feel. The nights when live music is played are the best; one is more than happy sipping beer and smiling."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grub as we got into the city late but wasn't able to make it here before the kitchen closed.  They allowed us to bring in outside food which was really nice of them!  Unsure if it is an ongoing policy but I sure hope so!  We ended up bringing in a few pizzas and offered some to the staff behind the bar. #winning

This was a great place for a group of 12 of us to grab some drinks after arriving into the city for about 2 hours.  The staff were friendly and it wasn't too busy on a Thursday night which gave us ample room to settle in.

We had a couple of pints and had a jolly good time! :-)"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés avec des amis pour la saint Patrick... super !!!!
Un chanteur avec sa guitare + des serveurs sympas = une bonne ambiance assurée
Des nachos AU TOP (à date, les meilleurs de mtl) + des bonnes bières = un ventre bien rempli
Total : un super bar où il fait bon d'aller passer du temps entre amis !"}
{"text":"I haven't managed to visit this pub when they have entertainment but on my most recent visit they had some nice 80s music playing while the football game was on. There was a new small menu and I tried the Mac n cheese with smoked meat, some of the best I have EVER tasted. My husband had a spicy chicken wrap and onion rings he enjoyed very much. Best of all is the excellent service we always receive, it really means a lot to us. I have been to other pubs in Montreal where your drink is completely empty and no one cares... :-(
This place has a lively vibe and employees who clearly enjoy their job. The restrooms are on the same level so no stairs! I love this. My only complaint would be the fish and chips... the fish was breaded, frozen kind and so fishy tasting."}
{"text":"We had a short stop in here for lunch. I had a yummy veggie burger while my boyfriend had a burger.  And the beer in tap was a nice selection. The staff was helpful. And the kilts are a bonus."}
{"text":"I really love this pub! I've been here a handful of times - usually with a large group for some drinks. I like that it's in a basement on De La Montagne street, away from the hustle of Bishop and Crescent bars.

During one of my recent visits, I discovered that one of their chefs is Sri Lankan and they therefore make really flavourful (and somewhat spicy) food like curries and chicken tikka. Their service is friendly and efficient, and love the fact that the guys wear kilts!

I was there last Friday night with a large group for game night (we were 10). We got a good corner at the back of the pub at 6pm and good thing we did because this place gets really crowded and loud on a Friday.

Some of us ordered dinner; I got the chicken tikka wrap, which is served with fries (average) and a curry carrot soup (spicy and delicious). The chicken tikka was so flavourful, really enjoyed my meal. 

They have a happy hour from 4-7pm so we were able to take advantage of the good prices on beer and cider. Had a blast and would go back!"}
{"text":"The trivia night is, hands down, the very best of Montreal. $5 pints on Mondays also makes this a top notch after work destination!"}
{"text":"Good food, great beers, and
a fabulous pub quiz on
Mondays.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Top notch pub! I came here with a large group of people and the vibe was jovial, the service was wonderful and my hot toddy was hot. It was BLOODY COLD outside and the warmth of the crowd, the staff and the booze seeped into my core and cured all that ailed me. This was my first time coming to Ye Olde Orchard, but it won't be my last! Somehow, it kinda felt like home but I'm an Irish-Canadian Maritimer after all. It's damn cozy, on a heart and soul level.
I ordered poutine, which was standard - not the best in the city but certainly not the worst, either. My partner had nachos that were pretty good. It is pub fare, after all - really, you're not there for the food, but for the charming stone walls, boisterous patrons, reasonable prices, easy location and casual camaraderie. I'm thinking this would be hangover breakfast heaven.  
The place was full to the rafters on a Wednesday evening, and it sounded like there might have been some live music happening later in the evening - somebody was having fun testing a microphone, anyway. I couldn't stay for the show, but I'd be curious to go back to check it out sometime. 

Four YARS for me mateys at Ye Old Orchard. It's as pubby as a pub gets."}
{"text":"cool looking nice dive bar near my hotel.. unfortunately the bartender couldn't make a proper black and tan.. they do have quite a few beers on tap though and this place is worth checking out if you want something more quiet and relaxed than the bars on crescent ave"}
{"text":"An old stomping ground of mine. Love coming here for happy hour and they still got that going nicely with a healthy selection of beer on tap. Pub food is of the traditional fare with a side menu which is Tamil based as per the origin of their chefs. For what it is, it's pretty decent.

Our waiter was rushed all night long since the place was paaaaacked but still managed to do a very good job. Food was provided after a reasonable delay. Drinks came quickly.

This is a great place to kick back and have a few beers."}
{"text":"We were here before and after a JFL show and had a great time.  We had an awesome bartender.  The menu was hit or miss as were the menu prices, but we would definitely stop by here again.  We shared the nachos, which were just ok.  My husband enjoyed the Cajun chicken sandwich.  I ate the Bonda -- one was enough after the nachos - and it was delicious, but I would have appreciated a dipping sauce with it.  Again, great service and Irish pub ambience."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went to Montreal for a weekend, and decided to walk around near our hostel to find a place to eat. Less then a ten minute walk away we found Ye Olde Orchard Pub, and it was exactly what we wanted. It was different than most places we would have gone to in America, the food was great and the waiters were so nice. We mentioned it was my friends 19th birthday expecting a piece of cake, and we got a special drink complete with rules and a name I shouldn't mention. The waiter overheard us talking about where to go that night and came right up to us and suggested about five different bars and clubs we should go to, some of which ended up being the best parts of the night. We couldn't resist going back there the next morning and the breakfast was just as good as the dinner. I would recommend it for anyone but especially if you're a group of traveling students like we were its a great place to go. If we ever go to Montreal again it will be first on our list."}
{"text":"We came here just for drinks so I didn't try the food. The bartender was very nice and appeared knowledgeable! Would def go back!"}
{"text":"Une belle place pour prendre une bonne bière à l'irlandaise.
Les propositions des plats s'accorde très bien avec leur choix de bières."}
{"text":"Solid, with better than average pub food, especially the giant extra spicy wings. There's the same good heart here as at the other two Olde Orchard locations but this one feels spacier and a little more laced up and downtown appropriate, perhaps due to the over large contingent of lawyers and sports fans."}
{"text":"My friends and I took a weekend trip up to Montreal from New Jersey and were staying on Sainte-Famille. This place was not a long walk from our place and was near the main Saint-Laurent. 

Upon entering, the place looked dark and loud since there was a live band playing that Saturday night. However, we were seated in the back dining area and the noise level was not too much where you couldn't converse with friends, but appropriate for a pub. This was a plus for me! The ambiance was warm and inviting with the faux - stone walls, wood tables, and Christmas lights. There were tvs set up for those who would like to watch some sports. 

Their beer list wasn't too bad and the prices were pretty sweet, compared to the drink prices we're used to in the NJ/NY area. 

I started off with the cream of turkey soup and it was delicious. I ordered the chicken Tikka wrap but it was pretty bland and lacked that masala taste I was looking forward to in the dish. The fries that came with the dish were way too greasy, but I guess it went well with the beer. My friends ordered the burgers and said they were pretty good. 

The staff was friendly and very attentive. The place is pretty good hangout place if you're looking to eat, drink, and hang out."}
{"text":"I was looking for a slightly more economical place for dinner, in the vicinity of the Marriott, and happened to come across this place, also a very short walk from the stadium where the Canadiens were playing the first game of the conference finals. Don't let the name fool you. The food is traditional pub fare, but the atmosphere is definitely early-twenties. They have large screens conveniently placed so that you can catch a game from literally any seat, which was nice, but during commercials, they jacked up the rap music, which was highly annoying.

It's pretty clean, and wide enough to navigate in. After waiting a little bit to get noticed, I just grabbed the table closest to the door. Service was so-so, they're nice enough, but when my beer's gone, I shouldn't have to send up a flare for another one, and while they had a decent crowd during the game, they weren't overwhelmed by any means. It's okay when your staff schmoozes with the clientele, but it shouldn't be at the expense of other, thirsty customers. I chose to eat inside to watch the game and get away from all the obnoxious cigarette hounds outside (they have tables on the curb, like a lot of Montreal joints).

I had the Cajun salmon. Their definition of \"cajun\" means blackened to the point of being dry, with just the slightest hint of spice, but not terrible. The rice was completely tasteless, but luckily it came with grilled peppers, mushrooms, and onions. The salad was a pain in the ass, large and leafy and stuffed into a small bowl. Almost impossible to eat without it spilling onto the table. But overall the food was probably the best pub food I had of all the places I've hit in the last few weeks.

Since it's a lower-priced place in an otherwise expensive area, I guess you get what you pay for. Their whiskey list is impressive, but given the tiny shots they serve, not worth it. Their \"trufflicious\" cake was, well, just chocolate cake. Overall, it wasn't bad for the price, but it's not a place to impress a date with the food or atmosphere. 

I will say, it was good enough that I will give it a second shot next time in town."}
{"text":"Amazing bar! Walking distance from downtown and the best music bands!!!! Ambiance is awesome even if a little too crowded.

Can't wait to go back....reminds me the college time!! Cheap beer and lots of fun!!"}
{"text":"I live next to this place and i really like it. Great beers, cool bands, good food (above average for a pub)... Staff includes some weirdos but most are ok. Great alternative when McKibbins is too crowded."}
{"text":"Great place to come for a Habs game. I ventured out one of our crazy winter storms and was pleasantly surprised to see the place around half full. YOO has a great Habs game night deal. For $30 you get two pints of their house lager, wings and nachos. For $15 you get one pint and wings. We went with two rounds of the $30 deal. They also have game night draws when you buy beer for some grand prizes and even did a draw for tickets for the next home game. Decor of the place is like an older basement pub but for guys who want beer nachos and a hockey game on the tube it's fine. The pub does have a fairly large beer selection and of course tasty pub grub. For sporting events on a guys night out what else could you ask for? There are other options downtown but YOO does the job just dandy."}
{"text":"Love this pub! Go to school right next door. Will never be back because of the extremely rude Irish bartender with the spiky hair. I am a bartender in an Irish pub and know what to expect from service when a pub is in a bit of a rush. Being talked down to by a person whose bar is fully empty for asking for a round of shots is not my idea of good service. This guy does not deserve to call himself a bartender. Perhaps he is more suited to serve soft drinks at McDonalds."}
{"text":"This was a very busy active pub right in the middle of down town Montreal. Tonight it was packed. There was a Habs/Leafs game underway. The beers were reasonable. 2 beers for $10.00!! Cheap. I had a Rolling Rock & it was delicious. Food was a side salad (which was delivered late-hate that, like to eat salad first) also had the Jalapeño Burger. It was decent as well. Our server was very nice & delightful!!"}
{"text":"Me and a few buds came here to kick off our last night in Montreal not expecting much, and boy were we surprised. Delicious food, good prices, friendly service, and nice live music. What a place!"}
{"text":"I really live this place. It's close to home, the vibe is always inviting and friendly and most importantly, the food is on point.

I've tried a few of their dishes and they have always hit the spot. If you're looking for a satisfying yet healthier meal, their salmon is great. I switch out the rice for mashed potatoes. Less healthy but super delicious. If you're a vegetarian, the veggie burger with sweet potato fries is sure to please. But if you're looking to really indulge in a comfort food classic, try the beef stew.  Huge portion with amazing gravy, big chunks of beef and vegetables, all nestled in a bowl with a mashed potato ring around it. Perfect."}
{"text":"Lunch Special- 
Carefully made homemade soup that will send your gills cawing from more. 
A super juicy delightful, mouthful of treasure of a burger . A whole whack of potatoes cut into fries. 
Even the coffee is stunning.!
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh the Irish pubs of Montreal! If Yelp was around years ago I would be the empress of these little big gems. Ye Old Orchard is one of my favorite. Good pub food, tasty Guinness and if you are looking for a local beer there is a nice choice on tap. The place is very quiet in the early hours of the evening (unless you end up watching a world cup game at noon). At around 9 pm the crowds arrive and with them the noise, the vibe, the party time."}
{"text":"Second to Hurley's for good pub grub on lunch. Fish n Chips - with really tasty chips. Stews, burgers, beer, etc. Don't expect fine dining here but expect so much better than those disgusting chain Pubs like Les 3 Brasseurs. One is function over form, the other is form over function. Good honest grub. A few years back I had ribs and they were AWESOME. Great to have right next to the office."}
{"text":"I've had a reeeaalllly average experience there. I was invited by work colleagues to meet at Ye Olde Orchard for a work shindig/event and enjoy their trivia night. I show up, and take place at a table reserved specifically for the occasion. The waitress doesn't greet me at all, but asks me if I'm there with the work party, I am, but then she ushers me to another table.. I brush it off and happily dive into our trivia night. 

It's all going well, when about 2 hours in, our waitress must have realized she was missing out on tips, so she circles our tables asking us to order.. We were all taken aback, since usually when we have rented spaces for events, they would be the ones offering us food, in exchange for plugs, ad space etc. We get ready to order, but nonono, she demands one order per patron. I had a $5 bill on me and that was it, so I ordered their Cream Ale (excellent drink selection, yo!). She was unusually pushy towards my Guinness-drinking buddy, which didn't go down well at our table. After 5 solid trivia hours, I decided to make my way home, but was stopped by our waitress again, \"is $5 your final order?\". Yes, I give tips for good service, not the way you wear that short plaid skirt. Meh."}
{"text":"I'm in Montreal 'til Thursday.  I felt like having supper at a pub so I walked to Ye Olde Orchard Pub & Grill (a 20 minute walk from my hotel).  I was there in December and enjoyed it.

My Griffon Blonde was good.

When I got there about 6ish, it was fairly quiet.

I ordered what I ordered the last time ... wings with medium sauce.  The last time I was there some of them were a bit undercooked.  This time it seemed like they'd been cooked and were sitting around for a while (or overcooked) and sauce added to heat them up.  The fries were good and I ate about a third of them.

It got busy after a while."}
{"text":"Great place to go. Good drinks, good food (for a pub) and great bands coming to play there. Amazing place to watch Hockey. Some of the staff are weird sometimes (uninterested/lazy attitude and slow speed) but they are ok most of the time."}
{"text":"A solid pub in downtown Montreal. If you're after wings, beer, and maybe some sport, you won't go wrong here.

The wings here are great. The 'kick-ass' spicy aren't too hot (for me, but then again I am VERY manly...), but just hot enough. They also come with sweet potato fries, which is cool. Some of my mates tried the curry here, and said it was really good - the menu has a lot of  Sri Lankan dishes (I think the kitchen staff are  Sri Lankan), and I've heard good things about them. 

The first place we sat down was a bit smelly, but they reseated us when we asked (watch out for the both near the toilets!) so it wasn't a big deal in the end.

There's a few screens around the place so you can definitely see whatever main sporting event is on (eg. hockey), but they're not huge/everywhere so I'd probably go somewhere else if that was my main focus.

We got there early (5pm) on a Thursday and there was plenty of room, but it did fill up after everyone got off work.

I was going to give this place three stars, but the the waitresses wear kilts, so it gets an extra star. WATCH OUT: the waiters also wear kilts, so if you're going to check the staff out, make sure you're checking out the right ones..."}
{"text":"Adding to the horde of existing positive reviews, I must say that Ye Olde Orchard has a great laid-back ambiance and a nice staff. As soon as I set foot in the pub, I felt like at home. 

My husband and I each had a veggie burger; it was decent and warm, served with a side of fries, a typical dish. He had Jack Daniels on ice and I had a specialty coffee, the Nutty Irish, which tasted great.

This simple and short visit was very pleasant and relaxing. We are very likely to visit again in the future. Heck, it's been only a few days and I already miss that coffee!"}
{"text":"Not a good pub. Went here on a Thursday evening to get dinner. ended up getting a black and tan that the waitress poured wrong (It was more like a shit brown tan) and when I was like \"ummm, this is just a \"tan\", she scoffed at me and than refused to give me any service or attention for the rest of my time in the bar, even going as far as to just nod at me when I pointed towards her and raised my empty glass (after trying to get her attention five previous times). I had to flag down a bus boy to place a food order. The servers also wear kilts like outfits that look dumb. Being a gentleman who has worked in the service industry before, I still left a 15% tip. should have left 5%.

If you want a good bar go to GRUMPYS, it is the best. If you want a good straight forward pub, head to McKibbins or if you must, Irish Embassy. This quarter Irishman would rather support an establishment that espouses Celtic pride rather than an ENGLISH colonialist establishment any day. Vive l'irlande, nique la reine!"}
{"text":"Great staff & food. Sri Lankan options are fantastic - our server told us that much of the kitchen staff is Sri Lankan so they make great dishes. Nachos were wonderful, good selection of beers, wifi had a password. This is a great cozy place to stop right in the village to relax, warm up and grub!"}
{"text":"I usually visit the one on Prince Arthur in downtown. It is very near our lab and it is our most favorite place for lab discussions, especially after a long week of frustrating results on Thursday or Friday evenings.
I really like the servers here, they are very attentive, even if the place is full and they are going crazy!
The house beer is only 4$ and this is what I order when I am cheap.
Otherwise, they do have other beers and interesting cocktails if you are willing to spebd extra :)
For a bar place, it serves very good food with even vegeterian options! I enjoy their chicken wings too. They have live bands during summers. And if you want to watch the hockey match with friends, you will love this place."}
{"text":"It is one of my favorite places to go for cheap hose beers and good bar food after work. The service is perfect. And the ambience is casual. They play music, but at a reasonable volume. Hence, you can hear each other talk without shouting.
For a bar, I would rate their food to be very good. Especially their naan pizza. The place is affordable and busy on weekends. They sometimes have live music if you stay tuned to their bulletin board, you would know when."}
{"text":"I get why people would put a 4 stars. Somehow, me 3 years ago would have probably put a 5 stars. It's a 3.5 star in my humble opinion. Simply put, I've been to a very large amount of irish pub and at the end of the day, it's confy, food is better then lot of bars and service is great. Plus the music once in a while is always great. What's not great about this pub and all Irish pub in Downtown Montreal in general: a pint is 7.75 to 8.50$ + a 1$ tip (less than that, you're cheap! Ye Olde Orchard has great food. had a large burger for 10-12$ and pints of beer there and there. Service was fast and seating was well arranged. Let's just say there' was place if you wanted to party and listen to the music, and place to sit, eat and talk without that much noise.

Je comprends pourquoi les gens veulent sortir dans un pub. C'est confortable. Des banquettes, de la musique chaleureuse, la game des habs sur les écrans de télé, de la bouffe de bar de bonne qualités! Mais, quand t'en a fait un, tu les as pas mal tous fait. C'est une belle place pour manger pas cher et boire de la bière. Par contre, c'est toujours cher la bière; entre 7,50-8,50 pour la pinte. J'ai mangé un Burger pas trop cher avec une bonne bière après le Gala de Boxe de Club Gym Yvon Michel au Centre Bell le 3 décembre puis c'était quand même pas mal occupé, belle ambiance, sympathique mais j'ai déja tout vu ça. C'est un bon endroit pour rencontrer quelqu'un pour une première fois, la disposition du bar nous permet de pouvoir manger avec un petite paix relatives, si je peux m'exprimer ainsi, et j'aime bien les band, la musique et le côté pillier bar du Ye Olde Orchard! Belle place, pas si cher sur la bouffe, mais maudit, s't'un pub, c'est au centre-ville, pis c'est cher boire la!"}
{"text":"Came here on a trip to Montreal with a few friends at around 8 on a Friday night. The pub was not crowded at all and had an inviting atmosphere. The lighting was a bit dark, especially if at a corner table. 
I ordered a burger with fries, and my friends ordered chicken tenders and the chicken sandwich. They said their meals were solid but nothing special. I agree, as my burger was good but nothing out of this world. The fries were classic pub fries and were nothing to write home about. 
The service was fast and the waitress was really charming. Overall, this is a good place for a casual meal with friends. Probably will try somewhere else next time I'm in Montreal, but don't regret coming here."}
{"text":"Good ambiance, great prices! The waiters are super nice with their kilts :D"}
{"text":"I've been plenty of times to the old orchard pub on Orchard, but this one has all the same qualities in the downtown core of Montreal.  They have plenty of brews on tap and GOD!! the pub food was hard to resist, but I was only stopping by for a pint or 3 before our dinner reservations.

Tip ... make friends with the door men because they will throw your A$$ out if Ye Olde drunkards get out of hand : )

Lots of tourist at this place and it tends to really clear out just before a hockey game at the bell center, so keep that in mind the next time your looking for a bar you can actually get a table at."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips. GF liked the burger. Excellent service and beers. Also got to watch the women's World Cup which was great. Planning to go again!"}
{"text":"Ended up going here because we were sick of walking. It was great. Nice cheap house beWe ordered the sausage naan pizza and it was much better than expected. I got the French onion soup which was also good and my husband got a meat dip sandwich? Which he enjoyed. The ambiance is low key with music and tvs and they have oversized Jenga and connect four. The service was impeccable."}
{"text":"This is definitely my preferred Ye Olde Orchard location (although the one on Prince Arthur is a close second).  It's quite large and unless there's a game or something at the Bell Centre it isn't too packed.  The food for the most part is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Great English style pub right off of St. Laurent. There's a ton of Montreal beer on tap and the bartenders are great. Around $7 for a beer or mixed drink, but worth it and expected in the city. The had a two-person cover band tonight (Reuben and someone else) who were fantastic. Only thing I can't comment on is the food. 

Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab a late night dinner and this pub served food until midnight so we found ourselves here at 11:40 pm, starving. It was a typical pub with plenty of tables and table tops in addition to a long bar. 

We sat a table top and a server immediately brought us menus and took our drink orders (Guinness, natch). I had a French dip that came with fries and a cup of lamb barley soup. Pretty decent pub fare; everything was tasty and not greasy. The place got really loud when a cover band came on and busted out with some Pretenders and U2 tunes. It actually got a little too loud for my comfort level but then again, I'm getting old. 

Surprisingly, it never really got crowded in there, even though it was a Saturday night and all the surrounding bars seemed packed to capacity. Well, I guess not everyone likes cover bands? If I lived in the neighborhood, I would likely frequent this pub as long as they took the band's volume levels down just a notch."}
{"text":"A GREAT place to either stop by for a pint, a bite to eat or watch a game.

I began by frequenting the 'original\" Ye Olde Orchard\" on Monkland years ago but since they have branched out to downtown and St.Laurent, I usually meet up with friends at this location.

Was here yesterday meeting up with a friend for brunch. Both of us had the Highlander Breakfast complete with sausages, ham, bacon, scammbled eggs and their IrishToast (French toast dipped in Bailey's). They also have that Dr. Seuss classic ,Green Eggs and Ham (It's actually scammbled eggs with pesto)!

Friendly service, a great menu, very good food and a laid back vibe make this a great spot along the Main to just chill and relax with a friend or more."}
{"text":"Good for drinks, live music and watching the game, fun atmosphere,  and the staff is friendly all while wearing kilts. The food is decent, I ordered the skins. Our group has burgers which were okay, the bLT was good."}
{"text":"For an Irish pub, it's pretty great! The service is fast, and thru have decent hot wings (although their 'burn your face off sauce' could bs a tad bit spicier). The food, however, is surprisingly good! Upon entry, we were seated and served by the manager, which was the best part of the experience (very fun guy, lots of great jokes!). Their drinks are just great (no complaints if your 'well' rum is Havana Club!)"}
{"text":"Our first food/beer stop in Montreal-wasn't too bad. We both had some draft beer and poutine (which was delicious). They had the Rangers/Tampa game on so every way you turned your head you had a great view. Pretty good and friendly service, we will return here again!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice already-and there's of course a reason we came back a second time! Our very first stop at a bar in Montreal was this NHL-friendly pub, and it did not disappoint. Although it was not super busy the first time we came (it was a Tuesday night) we were able to watch the Rangers/Tampa game over our first ever plate of Canadian poutine and it was delicious! Every employee was super friendly and attentive to everything. 

The second time around was a Friday night, game 7 of the same series. Although it was packed, again, our server was very friendly and quick when it came to our food and drinks, along with every shot we took when a goal was scored. 

Awesome atmosphere, delicious foods, and incredible service are the reason we came back a second time, and will come back again next time we visit Montreal!!"}
{"text":"We had walked from Vieux Montreal looking for a good happy hour and this is the first one we found, but it was a good one - all microbrew pints $5 CND. It was a Monday night so the prices were good all night and they had pub trivia. 

We enjoyed our first pints - mine was the apricot and fruity, but good enough for me, not a beer connoisseur. The place was very quiet when we arrived, but filled up quickly as we drank. Then we got hungry, so I tried their hamburger steak well done while he tried their veggie burger. My steak was not that great, fries were good, and I had a some plain baked green beans and carrots. My partner noted the veggie burger was heavy on the onion. The place cleared up just as quickly as it had filled by the usual end of happy hour. 

We didn't stay for the pub quiz, unfortunately. He worried it was going to be full on Canadian trivia; I felt, who cares? Service was ok - one waitress for what felt like the whole bar. Accepts credit cards. Good place to enjoy a drink."}
{"text":"Really good for watching play off games, especially on a Sunday or Monday. These days their happy hour goes until midnight. Lower tier draft beer is $5 a pint, their house beer is only $4 a pint! On Sunday they also have 1 lb of wings for $11. The medium spicy and the cider barbecue were both quite good, you can do half and half for the 1 lb order which was nice for variety. There is always plenty of room so you don't have to worry about what time you get there. The service was very good. Perfect English and French."}
{"text":"Vous voulez trouver les ailes de poulet les plus épicées en ville? Ne cherchez pas plus loin, c'est ici qu'elles se trouvent. C'est une chaîne montréalaise de pubs à l'anglaise, mais la nourriture, le service et l'ambiance est vraiment bien pensée de manières à ce que chaque emplacement semble avoir sa propre personnalité. La sélection de bières est très bonne et ils ont même la Ste-Ambroise aux abricots en fût à l'année longue, ce qui ne se trouve pas partout! Pour regarder un match de hockey, ou bien pour prendre une bonne bière après une journée de pêche entre amis, c'est une bonne place où aller!"}
{"text":"Everyone's in a kilt! How festive! Food is amazing, and they have an eclectic mix from your traditional pub food, huge helpings of poutine, to pasta dishes and salads. Staff are very friendly and dressed to the nines. Also, drink prices are super reasonable. You can get imperial pints of beer for just a few dollars. Can definitely get a bit loud on game nights, but would definitely return for more poutine. They can accommodate large groups if you have a party or celebration, plenty of tabling in the back."}
{"text":"A great place for warm food and ice cold beer. I will definitely make this place a frequent stop when I'm in Montreal. Worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Maybe I went on a off night but was not impressed at all!
Slow service.  Had to flag down our waitress to place our order.  That was a clue, and I wanted to leave at that point but my husband was hungry!
Ordered the calamari with marinara.  After added lemon salt and pepper it had some taste.  But very small portion for 14.00.  Waited for 39 minutes for our entree.  
I got the 10 ounce steak.  Opted out of the fries, added a salad instead, 3.00 up charge but glad I did.  If that was 10 ounces the scale is way off.  No way was it 10 ounces.  Didn't like the sirloin.  No taste.  My husband got the fish and chips.  He said it was average.  Our waitress never came over.  Another server brought out our dinners.  Flagged her again for the check.  Totally disappointed.  Actually told our Hotel thanks but no thanks for the recommendation!  Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place for a beer with friends, watching hockey or a casual dinner.

Enjoy a good variety of local and Irish / British beers in a great location. The place is really quite big, but the room is divided up to create comfy smaller areas. If you come here to watch a game, you will find there is no shortage of TVs, and you get a good view from everywhere.

The menu offers quite a variety, from burgers and other pub fare to Indian curries. The special house salad is a huge concoction of fresh greens and veggies, with a tasty dressing. The Indian curry was a little low on the spice level - but hey, it is a pub! Might be a better choice to stick to the classics."}
{"text":"Started coming here due to the world
Cup and discovered that they have great nachos. Will continue to go back even if the World Cup is over. Nice little pub."}
{"text":"Had salmon and a pint of shock top. Perfectly grilled salmon and all very tasty. Great atmosphere!"}
