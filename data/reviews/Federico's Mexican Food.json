{"text":"So today a coworker was going to get lunch and offered to grab me something.......he'll buy.

So I ask where he's going....Fredricos...... I paused, but figured if he's buying, I'll give it another try.....\"Get me a Carne Asada Burrito\".........after all, I had read this is what made them famous...

My rating has not improved.....still disgusting......couldn't eat it all, not because of the size.....but it was just disgusting......stale tortilla, meat flavored horribly......I could go on......."}
{"text":"I'm so HAPPY that North Scottsdale finally has a GREAT mexican restaurant!!!!
Everything I have had here, I love!  A list of items we have ordered:
Arizona Burrito, Chicken and beef tacos, bean and cheese burritos, cheese enchiladas, chicken soft tacos.... EVERYTHING is tasty and perfect! Flavor in every bite! We eat here all the time. 
The employees are friendly and the owner Freddie is such a great, caring, friendly guy!!!!

Specials:
Monday is burrito night $1.99 for some of the burritos
Tuesday is taco night! .99 beef or chicken tacos!!
Thursday is enchilada night! $2.99 gets you 2 enchiladas and a drink!"}
{"text":"Olivia took my order through drive thru, charged me the wrong amount and then kept me waiting at the window for 20 minutes. They forgot all about my order and had an attitude when I asked for my food. Terrible costumer service from Jeanette and Olivia."}
{"text":"This place was not even close to being good. GREASY GREASY I ordered a breakfast burrito and it was so horrible they need to cut back on cheese and not dip it in grease before they serve you. Also the lady at the window was rude."}
{"text":"Came in hoping for great service and food, and was quickly disappointed. Witness a guy by the name of Mike and Jose yelling at their employees. They also threw their attitude on me (a paying customer). I believe the way the managers/owners treat their employee's is the reflection of their product and service. The girls working there are nice, but they seem to be really tied down by the management. I could not believe how Mike acted toward the employees, he did not realize that I was waiting to be served. Customers eating also witnessed the incident. One guy stormed out of the building. It really upset me. A friend of mine also witnessed a similar incident in December. I took a client out to eat here and totally regretted my decision. I don't understand how a business like this can still be open. My girlfriend got food poisoning from these guys in February. The food was fair at best, but their service is terrible. They've mixed up orders and gave me wrong items numerous times. It's also way overpriced. The drive thru is tricky at first, but once you do it, it's easy. Long wait times, they overuse salt to \"enhance\" the flavor and the tortilla are extremely tough. I've tried this place over 10 times within the past year, once I've became ill from the food. Just a really frustrating place to be at. I called and voiced my opinion, and in three months I MIGHT return with an update review, however with what I've witnessed and experienced I may never return. As of now, I say go to Filiberto's on Grand Avenue or Rita's."}
{"text":"i really like the chile rellenos.  had a beef enchilada once and the meat tasted like it was burnt, haven't had them since."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Best fast food Mexican food I have had in AZ. Ordered the carne asada tostada and a chicken taco. Both were seasoned perfectly and included very fresh garnishes and a delicious salsa bar. My only regret is that I didn't discover this place sooner. And the prices are very reasonable. Can't wait to go back this weekend!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at Federico's a lot however the lAst time I went the guacamole tasted horrible and the cheese in my enchiladas was cold and not even melted yet. I got very sick after eating here that day and would not eat here anymore. The girls working in front seem so miserable and rude all the time I feel as if I am bothering them when I order. They never smile or seem happy to help. Horrible customer service overall and cold uncooked food."}
{"text":"It's definitely busy as it is just opening but this is the best bite for your buck this far West. Hit it up Tuesday for dollar tacos... now if only they served alcohol!"}
{"text":"Normally we love going here but both the last two times things have been bad. The last time was early morning breakfast run on this past weekend. We went early to get a breakfast burrito and bean and cheese. My husband's burrito looked amazing my bean and cheese was horrible you can tell they watered down the beans too much and green sauce we got with it was also full of water nothing like it normally is. Ugh and time before that had super nachos and the toppings tasted water down as well and chips were a little too moist from it. Normally this is our go to spot but that  might change now. :("}
{"text":"I come here often but honestly because there isin't another Mexican restaurant as close as this one to my house. Their food is good but I feel like they're always raising prices. The employees are nice & restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Nothing special unfortunately. That didn't come to a surprise though. Tiptoeing the line just like every fredricos.."}
{"text":"Best Mexican fast food ever and good prices. Mon-Wed taco and burrito special prices increased a bit but 1.25 for a hefty delicious red chicken taco is a great value.  No frozen prepared food; you can see the vat of chicken cooking. I especially love the beef tostada with sautéed onions, peppers and tomatoes.  A $3 meal and so filling!  Clean and good service. We will go back often!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I would normally never go to a place like this. Fast food and Mexican food together just doesn't seem like a good combo. I love Mexican food so I'm definitely picky when it comes to it. This place was just alright, the costs were surprisingly pricy for fast food, I've seen close to the same prices at an actual Mexican restaurant. The service was just okay, the lady wasn't super friendly but she wasn't rude either. The chicken wasn't my favorite, and the red and green sauce were just pure liquid, nothing special. It wasn't terrible but I probably won't come here again."}
{"text":"Hi.  I'm talking about the one on Peoria and 43rd ave. 

The food was great....service not so much.

Everyone was extremely rude....

Customers were served on servers timely manor if they were Hispanic (of which I am not)....

Very poor service.  Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan.  Good food at a good price. Great value for what you get.  Quality is fantastic.  My kids love taco Tuesday .99 cent tacos are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Best Chili Renos when they serve them nice and hot , cheese melting out of them!! Great Chimi and Green Burritos!! The staff there is always friendly and very accommodating, specially the Owner, or maybe he is the manager IDK:) I would recommend it to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious!  Great prices, chips and salsas are fantastic!  Better than any Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Smaller portions than others. More expensive than others. Wirse service than others. Not coming here again. Don't waste your time or money.  Waited in the drive thru for 15 min while only customers. Asada undercooked and cheese burnt. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Went here the other night at 1:20am they close @ 2am and the sign said open so i pulled up to the drive through and waited a couple mins know one answered so pulled up to the window I could see the workers ignoring me so i drove around to the speaker again still no answer. Iam very pregnant and was really hungry and didnt want to drive any further so proceeded to go back to the window finallya middle aged mexican lady opened the drive through and said \"What do you want?\" In the rudest way and gave me the worst look possible. No hello, no thank you, or have a goodnight just total unpleasantness. Theyre food is decent and there \"open late\" but ill never go back for that type of wouldnt even call it service again."}
{"text":"Probably the worst meal I've had in a long while. If a restaurant has posted guidelines on returning your food at the register, turn around and find another place to eat. I joked about the return policy, but then when I ate some of the food, I understood."}
{"text":"A drive through that's  open when you're hungry and everything else is closed. Score! Good food, clean facility, good service, and lots of choices on the menu. We eat here a couple times a month and have never been disappointed. Love the Carne asada plate and the tortas. Yumm."}
{"text":"Foods not that good at all; Rito's is much better. My issue is the thick, black, curly  pubic like hair I found in my beans. Fortunately, I was in the kitchen when I opened my styrofoam container. Had I opened and consumed them in a darker room or it been wrapped in a tortilla... I may not be here. I only saw Latin people working here so it wasn't hair from the scalp. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Ordered two breakfast burritos and spent 35 minutes waiting in the drive through line. Ridiculous. Tried to speak with a manager and he wasn't there. Will not be back here again."}
{"text":"Incredibly poor customer service!!!  The female employee working the drive-thru did not say one word to me when I drove up to the window, provided payment or when she brought my food.  No smile, no words or any other recognition that she was interacting with another person.  

While the food was decent, I would think twice about ever returning.  Food was probably three stars but only giving one star due to poor service."}
{"text":"Tried to short change me ....giving me a peso with my change!!!   Called it to their attention asking for my dollar bill vs. peso and was told they had no $ 1.00 bills.....but suddenly they produced
 one...Very rude and DISHONEST!!!!  Count your change/coins CAREFULLY!!     BUCKEYE location."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick meal. Good salsa, food seems fresh and not greasy. Price is unbeatable and the place is spotless.. The food at this location is better than the others in the valley."}
{"text":"Pass this place up its not worth going in the enchiladas had onions and bell peppers and  little meat"}
{"text":"Such nasty food! I don't recommend it to anyone. The service is horrible and the food is nasty! The person who cooked the food stuck his ladle into the pot and tasted whatever he was cooking"}
{"text":"We started eating here in November 2013. It was good and we ate here at least once a month. Then sometime in February 2014 they raised their prices and the food quality went DOWN HILL! The last time we went We spent 30 dollars on dinner for a family of 4 and we all ordered something different. We ended up SICK! Not going here ever again."}
{"text":"Would not recommend bought a chili Relleno burrito with carna asada meat paid 2 dollars extra for meat it was the smallest burrito I've ever gotten at a burrito place and cost 8 dollars  I complained and they didn't care so I've never been back"}
{"text":"Great place for some Mexican food.  I have been several times with my wife and co-workers and never had a bad dish.  Place also has a friendly feel as well, day time manager is very customer friendly and seems like he actually like what he does."}
{"text":"That salsa you put up you might wanna mix it its homeade salsa the water at times divides from the tomatillo when its in a small container . DUHHHHHHH.."}
{"text":"Bomb Mexican food. 
You know it's authentic when your food is all greasy , and slopped together on a plate in a disorderly fashion. 
Sub the ham for bacon in the breakfast burrito and add potatoes. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Ladies, fella's......this is a \"GO\"!  I absolutely love this place.  I've tried many items on the menu and everything has been excellent.  No matter if you go inside or use the drive thru, your food is always out fast hot and delicious.  I go 5 miles out of my way to hit this place up, that's how good it is.  The ONLY thing that I would ask that they change is to start using skinny fries in their Carne Asada Fries meal, instead of the crinkle cut."}
{"text":"We were in town at an event at GCU and ordered catering for 35 people same day. The food was ready to go, delicious, and very reasonable. The staff was helpful and the food was so good! Our team was very happy. Thank you, Fredericos!"}
{"text":"It's a step above all of the 'berto's places. Recommend the adobada plate or burrito or 2 beef burrito combo. Breakfast get the machaca burrito. Huge portions and cleanliness of the restaurant is a plus. Will make you want to never visit a taco bell again."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER !!!!!! I highly recommend this place to everyone and they're momma !!! I love everything so good and facilities are clean ! Madelyn is an awesome cashier !"}
{"text":"Nothing in the world more irritating than a person in the role of customer service that cannot understand English language. I asked for a very simple order.... they had me repeat it 3 more times then still got my order wrong... she asked me if I wanted hot sauce, I said yes I do, the hottest you have please....only to find no hot sauce. Seriously wth?! I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Not very happy about the fact that online it says 24 hours and it really isnt even the sign out front said 24 hours when i got there all the light were off even went through the drive through and sat there... there was nothing, then when i got to the window no one was in there and it was pitch black..."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Every time I have gone there the wait gets longer and longer. This evening I was the only car in the drive-thru. They took my order promptly and they took my card charged it and then didn't tell me anything until about 15- 20 minutes later but tried giving me the wrong order (the car behind me) meaning my order was just there sitting. After a few more minutes they finally gave me my food. The girl just laughed it off bc she was confused on orders. They have a sign stating it takes longer bc everything is fresh which is fine but not when it's ready and sitting there and the staff don't acknowledge you until after 15-20mins."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place about a month ago because it's really close by and we just moved to the area, so we had some take out. This has to be the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The food was bland and dry, and not to mention a little pricey. I'd avoid this place ... there are other options for Mexican food that aren't too far away."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat when you're not trying to spend lots of money, and want something to fill you up. Some Federico's locations can be a bit trashy, but they always serve good food. They are also open late so it's perfect for a late night snack! 

I'd recommend getting the carne asada fries!"}
{"text":"Simple,  cheap, easy, with a drive thru is the best way I can give to describe this place.  

Oh.....and quick. 

Which is a unique spin on more tradional mexican good places.   Great for a quick lunch.  I call it the target of mexican food.... more upscale  than taco bell and yet you are not getting your tequila here"}
{"text":"One the chicks there super hot I'd bang for sure 

Two food is pretty god damn amazing big fan of it 

And finally three no Manches Hugo Sanchez yall feel me I'm knocking let a brother in 

NEVER FORGET FERGUSON MIZZOU"}
{"text":"Great drive through mexican food. Rivals Robertos in San Diego. Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here again today and love this place.  I have probably eaten here at least 50 times and my wife probably 100.  She eats here at least once or twice a week.  The five rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole are her favorite and their unsweetened ice tea is excellent.  I am in love with their chilled red sauce and have tried plenty at just about every bertos and mexican restaurant in town.  This is by far my favorite and I could literally drink it, the taste is so good.  I have a bunch of favorites form the shredded beef tacos, el burrito bandito (with shredded beef), to the fried bean and cheese burritos, fish tacos, pork adobado, etc.  

I also thought Menudo (cow stomach soup) was disgusting until I tried it here.  I now love it and their red chile broth is amazing.  I am still the only one in my family that will touch it with a 10ft pole, but it rocks at this place.  The owner and his wife are also very nice and very good people.  Can't really say anything bad other than sometimes at the drive through, it can be a little harder to order if it isn't the owner or his wife.  Some employees have a more difficult time understanding what you are asking them due to speaking spanish as a first language.  This is never an issue when inside where you might get to chat with the cool owners.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"carne asada fries were well drained and perfectly cooked. the cheif did not skimp on carne over the top. food was hot when we picked it up. the side of beans was a small meal by itself. my burrito was very good- fresh tastes, well cooked. I am not a person that enjoys food, but I Enjoyed eatting at Frederico's."}
{"text":"Food poisoning from carne asada tostada.
Up all night pewking.
Horrible experience. 
Same thing happened to my son in law a few months back.
Won't ever eat there again"}
{"text":"Federico's is a nice new taco shop in an area that needs good Mexican food desperately.  It has 3 flat panel TV's wich is a bonus. The food is pretty good. Their beef nachos are really good,  the chicken nachos, not so much. The hard shell tacos are good also. They also have the bottled mexican sodas, I tried the lime soda and it was really good, I get one everytime I go now. Welcome to the hood Federico."}
{"text":"Great price for the amount of food. The carne asada and chicken mini tacos were great."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a burrito that will change the way you look at Mexican food, try the El Rey. It has bacon, ham AND steak. Plus there is guac and pico packed in there. If you aren't hungry, don't try it. 

Warning: Loosening of your belt and tearing of pants may occur after consumption."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative I would. I went in with a list of 6 different type of burritos. Guy only billed me out for 4. I get back to my office after finally getting all 6 burritos and not one of them was labeled. Never going back."}
{"text":"Federico's Mexican Food is amazing. The service is great, the food is excellent, and the prices are extremely fair. It's a tremendous value for what you receive, and I can't recommend it enough. 

I've gone to this location several times and each time I've come away impressed. You can tell that the food is made to order and prepared with attention, a rare feat nowadays. 

Bottom line, if you are debating on whether or not to try it, or if you are just looking for delicious Mexican food, go for it!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh & delicious food look no further my friend. The service was fast and friendly and served with a smile. They even let me sample the horchata! The restaurant was clean and they are even open 24hr. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but the service is the worst. I am writing this review while still waiting to pay. I hope they get my order right this time."}
{"text":"Probably not the healthiest food in the world, and certainly not the most authentic, but a pretty decent place to grab a quick bite to eat.  Highlights of the menu include a green chili burrito on par with Filiberto's, a variety of pretty good quesadillas and some darn good breakfast burritos.

Their sausage breakfast burrito and country breakfast burrito (egg, cheese and potato) are pretty darn good.

The only complaint I have about them is their cheese, which seems to be processed.  It's not a huge negative, but some items could go from good to great with a better choice of cheese.

As it stands not something I'll go out of my way for, but something I don't mind grabbing if it's convenient."}
{"text":"I like your location and your menu is really vast, Taco Tuesday is always a hit at my house, my Sons love the Macahca (however it's spelled)"}
{"text":"Warning!!! Watch your bank account after transactions. We through the drive thru at approx 350am. Ordered a breakfast burrito and the night shift guy over weight build wearing black rimmed glasses gave himself a $10 tip. Service was slow and he stated he was on the phone with the police. Best conversation I heard with the police. Beware!"}
{"text":"Awesome service became such good regulars they even open the door after hours food is always fresh and made the same every time highly recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the drive thru takes way too long every single time. My visit today I was the only car and it took over 10 minutes of sitting at the window to get my food, which I can deal with however I got home and realized they didn't put the flan that I paid for in the bag. I live too far away to go back, I should have checked but I assumed they would be able to put the right contents in the bag. Cashier is almost never friendly even when I say please and thank you. Food is good but I don't think I'll be going back again"}
{"text":"Great food.  fajitas, caldo de camaron & torta de asada were all delicious.  It's not cheap but the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"This place is great despite the bad reviews.  Dollar tacos and 2 dollar burritos Monday Tuesday and Wednesday.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"I got the Chimichanga combo and thought the portion was too large! Prices are above average.  However, 24/7 drive-thur!"}
{"text":"-Great customer service and  the best shrimp burrito!! You can't compare this Federico's restaurant to any other ..            -Este restaurante no se compara a los otros Federico's restaurantes .. excelente comida y servicios,recomiendo el burrito de camarón!!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING - DON'T EAT HERE!

I should've know better not to eat here, since the other times I did their food didn't taste that good, but it was last minute and they're close to my house. I got a carne asada burrito with steak and rice only and I currently have one of the worst cases of food poisoning I've ever had. I've been throwing up for the last 24 hours and have the worst case of diarrhea ever. I can't even keep yogurt or crackers down.

Unless you want to lose 12 lbs in 24 hours, Please don't eat here! I'd be willing to bet their health inspection ratings are very low."}
{"text":"We just bought a house in the neighborhood of 67th ave and Peoria. We were skittish about going to Federico's, but man are we glad we did. Ground beef tacos are awesome! My personal favorite is the Shredded Beef Burrito. They don't pile tons of stuff on it like other places; they make it with green peppers, tomatoes, and onions. I requested sour cream and man it was killer! It's like a giant fajita!

They have all kinds of specials too. These [bad] reviews really don't do this joint justice!"}
{"text":"Just passing through we came upon this place.  And, for a fast food Mexican restaurant, it was awesome.  I'd put the quality of the food on par with any good full service Mexican restaurant. 

And, the value for the price was great too!

Wish there were one of these restaurants in St Augustine!"}
{"text":"First time in to this location and it was amazing! The drive through went super quick, even though there were a few people ahead of me, and when I added to my order and asked for extra red sauce, the girl was super friendly. I will definitely be back! I was soooooo happy when I saw Federico's and am even happier it's a great location as far as service, cleanliness, and tastiness."}
{"text":"Great food.I get the chicken asada burrito. Always friendly I and i like seeing my order prepared right then."}
{"text":"Nice place,good service. Love the food.
One of my favorite places for lunch.
Chicken chimmy is just yummy."}
{"text":"I use to love this place but tonight was the last straw the shredded beef in my tacos were completely not edible (all burnt and crunchy)! This is the third time in a row that this has happened. I certainly won't be returning."}
{"text":"When this place first opened they were good but then we started noticing changes..like when you would ask for potatoes in your breakfast burritos and you would get partially cooked french fries instead. Yuck. 
So we hadn't eaten there for awhile until tonight, hoping they got better.  Nope. I ordered the grilled chicken salad. They didn't give me dressing so i went up to ask. \"Oh we are out of dressing sorry.\" Gee that would have been nice to know when I ordered in case I wanted to get something else. No bell peppers in the salad which they used to do. The carrots they used were the pickled carrots they put in the cooler in the front. Yuck.
My husband ordered the fajitas and got chopped meat! Since when does fajita meat come chopped? His veggie mix had jalapeños in it and the mix was undercooked. 
We should have gone to subway instead."}
{"text":"Good shredded beef burrito, the enchilada was sub par. Good rice and beans, open 24/7=good enough!"}
{"text":"It's NOT boring - it's INCREDIBLE!  The Arizona 24 hour Mexican restaurant bean tostada is seriously one of my favorite foods, and Federico's has one of the best.  Add their hot sauce and WOW!  They offer both red and green salsas and just a few drops of each magic liquid make every bite simply outstanding.  You can get a happy mouth and a full belly for just over $2. You've gotta try this place."}
{"text":"Green Chile burrito gave me food poisoning, it appeared to  be pork and not beef so it could of been old since it was part of the 3.50 deal mon-wed. Everything else was good but i would be careful with the green chile."}
{"text":"I usually don't care for Mexican fast food chains but Federico's is to die for. I come here quite often and I get the rolled tacos meal with no guac but sour cream instead. There is one lady who is at the window a lot of times when I come there and she ALWAYS remembers my order. She's very friendly and always knows it's me when that order is placed. My order is always right when she's there. There's been a couple times before where there was guacamole on my tacos but Federico's almost always gets it right. The food is great, although sometimes the beans can be a little more bland on certain days. All in all, I recommend this to everyone who is looking for great food on the go."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast burrito from here the other day and it was delicious! Not what I was expecting from \"fast food\" but glad I tried it. I will def go here again! Quick service and yummy food!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go there at least once a week to get my favorite, their chorizo special burrito. It's a breakfast item but you can order it any time, which is awesome! I also love their carne asada fries. Their prices are fair for the amount of food you get, and it's always fresh, plus their right by my house which is a big plus! All in all, this place is great if you are looking for quality Mexican fast food!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious had a crane asasa burrito without pico and guac (allergic to tomato) had with cheese and beans. Very good, some places the beans and meat is a a little dry, but here it was juicy and good. I would really recommend this place. Like everyone else says, \"if you pass this place or come up to it, stop and enjoy deliciousness\""}
{"text":"First off, I want you all to know that I have been here 4 times and tipped them 15% every time.

So 

If you don't mind people charging your card for more money than they should, this is your spot.  Everytime I come here, I am told a price at the drive at the mic which is much more than the price on the menu.  Then I am told a even higher price at the window. And when I am handed the recipt and look at the price I can see that they added a dollar or two to the price that I was told at the window.  I have been there 4 times now day and night, and it happened everytime.  I don't know if it is the same lady every night around 10-11 but she is definitely negative in addition to this scam of a business. 

Just to make matters worse, I ordered a asada burrito on one of my trips.  When I got it, it was cold and burned on the outside.  It was way too obvious that they had reheated a previously made burrito that they had sitting around.  The inside of it was cold and the totilla was soggy.  

I am not a hard customer to please and I tipped these guys every single time my 15%.  But when I see a price tag of 5.99 and end up paying over 9 dollars for one re-heated burrito, I will warn others."}
{"text":"Tasty and fresh for Mexican fast food. Establishment is very clean and service is good. I've always been very satisfied."}
{"text":"Bad experience with food quality:
-dry tortillas (burritos) both bean and cheese
-dry beans
-dry shredded beef (taco)
-salsas red and green were bland
** place was empty.. should have trusted our instincts when we drove up"}
{"text":"While the food had good taste it was served cold and had to be sent back. The music was just loud enough to be hard to converse over. The place was clean and the staff were friendly. I guess it's a new place so they still have a few bugs to work out. There was a little boy riding a scooter, he apparently belonged to an employee.  He was in and out of the kitchen to the parking lot with the scooter several times. I'm thinking it was not exactly a sanitary practice. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Not the best but not to bad. They used to sell some really good carmel churros but this past last visit i was told that they no longer sale them. Hope they bring them back soon because that was the main reason id stop by."}
{"text":"Excellent choice to cater from here:   Thursday's is take out for us--always chili relleno plate and a carne asada buritto.  Love both. Needed to cater for a golf group of 45 so tried many other things on the menu and with the help of the friendly staff we ordered what would be easy for us--beef and cheese enchiladas, beef and chicken chimi's, green chile verde, etc.  everyone RAVED about how good the food was!  It should be easy to find excellent Mexican food in Phoenix but it isn't--we are fussy and want authentic food and that's why we love this Frederico's.  Already planning to cater from here this next year."}
{"text":"I eat Federicos now and then ,   I usually get the shredded beef tacos, Cheap and good .I went on Christmas and decided to mix things up a little by trying the burritos ,Shredded beef had cooked down peppers and onions .No flavor and very soggy. The bean and cheese wasn't right. I tried unrolling it to put sauce and couldn't because is was like they covered the whole tortillas with beans and the rolled it up .gave me 3 napkins and when i asked for more to soak up the burrito juice that was running from the shredded beef  and  they   only gave me another 3 .The prices went up too .I think its time to find another place for tacos"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not recommended they always give me the wrong food. Food is very salty and if you call to tell them about the wrong order they just laugh at you."}
{"text":"Why!!!! So disappointed. ..wanted good mexican food and the roll tacos are so nasty.  Super hard and cold! Isn't there anyone supervising how the food is cooked."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area been to others always good this  place the food is over priced and is not that  good  got a bean and cheese  burito  and they charged extra for the cheese and the burito was so small you should  give your  customers  what  they pay for I will drive to the east side fir my mexican food will not be back here again"}
{"text":"Well, I took my friend out for her birthday yesterday.  She is Mexican, although she really hates Mexicans.  One of her friends had mentioned that Federico's in the Fry's parking lot at Cotton Lane and Greenway had really good food, so when I asked her where she wanted to go, she thought we'd try it.  (On my birthday we go Asian, on her birthday, we do Mexican.)  All over town there are Frederico's, Pederico's, and all kinds of little drive thru Mexican places (good food, ambience not so good).  Last time I went to Frederico's they were out of refried beans... (?!).  I said, why are you open??  Anyway, so I didn't know what to expect.  But we pulled up and they had a lot of tables inside, as well as a drive thru on the side.   I ordered chili rellenos and she ordered a special with 5 tacos/carnitas (pork?).  We both wanted flour tortillas (like the Amercians do) instead of the corn tortillas.  That food was soooo good!!   I asked her if it was authentic and she said Ci, Ci, Ci.  I finished it and wanted more, even though I'm still full.  I will go back for more.  It was $15.00 for 2 people.  My friend missed the availability of cocktails, of course, but I don't drink and drive (usually).  I can afford to take my kids there for a guaranteed good meal.    We were there for 3  hours in spite of no ambience! :)"}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego and being spoiled by all the amazing taco shops, this one is the closest I have yet to find. We ordered the carne asada fries, the 4 street tacos, and a fish taco. Everything was delicious and fulfilled my cravings. The carne asada is very flavorful, tender and not fatty at all."}
{"text":"I eat here 3 times a month,  tacos are great.  Wish the chip bar would come back. Other than that I like it."}
{"text":"I was greeted with warm smiles. When asked what I wanted, I really didn't know. I was not rushed but the ceviche was suggested. I replied that I was very picky about my ceviche. I was offered a taste of it. How many places do that now days? It was really good and very fresh! I really was hoping for some spice so I ordered the chili rellenos. They were very tasty and served with rice, beans and tortillas. I recommend this place if you are looking for a relaxed, fast food atmosphere with friendly service and flavorful Mexican food. Yum."}
{"text":"This place has to be the most terrible service I have ever received. They usually mess up my order one way or another. But just ordered two burritos, and they literally messed up ever aspect of both orders."}
{"text":"The burritos aren't bad. But this place is pretty overpriced for street food quality food. $6-$7 for a single burrito. But when you're craving something at 4:30am and nothing else is available you're gonna go here. Tomatillo salsa isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Great food, but I notice I had to hit the restroom really quick  I think it my be too much hot sauce n chilli pepper in there prep mix. Other than that, great food. The restroom can sure use a can of air freshener."}
{"text":"Good clean place and fresh food. Would give five stars if they added Pico to the salsa bar. Been twice in 2 weeks and would go back."}
{"text":"There tacos are excellent!! On taco Tuesday there 1.25. I'm coming here all the time."}
{"text":"I ordered one taco last night in the drive through line. literally took 20-30 minutes with only two cars in front of me..... I had to get the car behind me to back up in order to escape."}
{"text":"Looks like fast food, but the place and food are so much more!  The burrito and tacos were EXCELLENT, as was the salsa/chili bar.  Prices were great, and the food was extremely fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Food was fast and full of flavor. My husband who normally will not touch re-fried beans demolished them. This restraunt will defintly be the spot we go to when. We crave mexican."}
{"text":"It tastes good and it's always cheap. The only reason why I knocked off a star is because they got my order wrong two times that I've been there."}
{"text":"Pollo Asado Taco with BACON added is Taco Nirvana!"}
{"text":"Best carne asada in town! Been here several times since the whole breakout in August. So everybody calm down and do some research. I read online they got the local Queen of Clean as an independent consult, this place is spotless. I've went into the restaurant and from the counter u can see everything in containers like at Panda express. Get the carne nachos or carne asade fries, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The cheese enchiladas are good.  I had the chicken burrito once and was not impressed. Staff are nice and accommodating. Much better than Taco Bell any day."}
{"text":"Don't. Just don't. Cheese enchiladas with cold shredded cheese, swimming in rank sauce. 
Thirty dollars for two to eat disgusting cold fast food. Go to taco bell at least you expect bad and it is a lot cheaper"}
{"text":"Hot fresh tortilla chips?! I'm in heaven! Taco Tuesday here is legit. Fresh tacos, no pre made shells. Refried beans & rice are also awesome. Good steady flow of patrons & service was fast with a smile. I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Their country breakfast burrito is so delicious I could eat them for the rest of my life! I wouldn't be surprised if the burrito was at least 2 pounds if not more! I also am relieved that there is finally a place in this neighborhood open 24hrs!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those spots that can give you the best taco of your life one day, and a rubbery mess the next.  It really is a crap shoot.  They are open all night, but I'd stick to high volume times if you want fresh tasty food.  Although, when you need some rolled tacos at 3am, they're there for you."}
{"text":"This joint just opened up by my house, so I thought that on $1.99 burrito tuesday i would give it a shot. What a mistake. I was pulling chunks of inedible food out of my mouth. It was those parts of the chicken, you know the ones, the connective cartilege, chunks of bone, grizzle, fat. I know that it was only $2.00 but really? Taco Bell delivers better food, and that is saying alot. 

Their salsa is weak at best. I asked for hot salsa, it was not even close. The mild green tabasco sauce i buy has more flavour and heat. 

What a complete waste of money. I would never go back."}
{"text":"91st ave and union hills fredericos location , the food is always good and the store is always clean , but this past sunday something strange happened , i walked in like i always do (drive thru speaker noise is bad) , the young lady took my order (familily of 4) , after 15min of wait time she asked me if i have casj to pay for my food and i said no only my credit card , she told me that their cc machine is down and with a rude tone told me to go to an ATM (wow) , now im not expecting anything free but why should i drive 5miles back to my house to grab the debit card for atm then to the bank to take money out and back to the store to pay for my food ,  we were eating from there 2 sometime 3 times a week (like i said they have food) , i will never step foot in that or any other fredericos because of this small incident , she should've said take the food pay next time ( she knows me i go there a lot )or your meal is on us tonight , and thats customer service for me , sending your customer to an atm its not very profesional ..and thats that"}
{"text":"Two stars because the taste was good. However, although we already know your carne asada is pre-cooked and just sitting there and waiting to fill the next order, it's really annoying to order a carne asada burrito with cheese and it being literally cold!!! The meat is cold. The tortilla is cold. The cheese isn't even melted because the whole thing is cold!!! What would it cost you to at least put the pre-cooked carne on the grill for a minute or two and actually serve up a warm or hot burrito??? So annoying and disappointing..."}
{"text":"I've been to Frederico's twice now (both in Buckeye, AZ). The first time I made a major mistake and ordered three tacos and some chips and beans. This was WAAAAY to much food although the cost was less than $10. The meal was excellent, tasty, hot, and filling. I didn't eat it all but not because it wasn't good ... there was just too much.  

My second time at Frederico's I ordered the #1 (tostado, taco, beans, and rice plate).  Very good food with fast service (to go). Although it is considered \"fast food\" it was the same as you would find in a good Mexican sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"I always though the food was just \"OK\". Found plastic in my burrito, today. Never had any issues before. I won't eat there anymore. I have a \"One Strike Rule\" for restaurants."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are decent but don't expect them to honor their coupons. They add extra conditions to them that are not printed on them so they don't have to honor them. When you ask to speak to a supervisor you get another member of the family so don't expect a different answer."}
{"text":"Always had a good experience. This is three only mexican restaurant I've been to that actually season their food."}
{"text":"Terrible food,  the rolled tacos are so hard you can't bite into them. The guacamole is NASTY! Taste like it's expired. I also ordered a shrimp cocktail but have not tried it yet and at this point I don't really wan to."}
{"text":"Love taco Tuesdays!!! our whole family loves their tacos. We also really love their plain chicken burrito too. we often just stop by to buy a bag of warm fresh tortilla chips and grab some salsa. service is always great."}
{"text":"Always mess up my Menudo.  Always ask for no pigs foot and they always add it. They might think this is funny. That's okay. Going to El Mirage from now on. Added picture."}
{"text":"Been here a couple more times now and I have gotten their tacos for taco Tuesday and my favorite is the ground beef one! Also their chimichanga combination plate is delicious, the burrito itself is nice and crispy with loads of shredded beef inside."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life. Very rude staff especially the girl with colored hair that always wears short shorts behind the counter and says she's management. Threw a fit at me when I asked that she replace my food that I had received in the drive thru soaking wet!!! Left with no food and she refused to refund!"}
{"text":"Me and the wife just moved here from Michigan and was in the mood for Mexican food so we decided to stop in Federico's on greenway in Surprise... Big mistake the food is overpriced and is disgusting!!!! We have better Mexican food then this in Detroit... WONT EVER BE BACK"}
{"text":"Over priced, small portions, not too tasty.

People working there were nice & the salsa bar is great, but there is a place down the road that is much better."}
{"text":"I'm not a regular of Federico's, so I don't know if the one we visited is indicative of the others, but quick thoughts:

1. My wife nearly spat out the ice tea.
2. My daughter's drink was so disgusting I ran into the bathroom to spit it out after tasting. I made her dump it for another. The cashier mentioned they changed the type of soda in the machine, but any good restaurant would at least flush the system.
3. The steak in my dish, even though I had it chopped, was tough. Some of it was inedible.
4. The salsa, while spicy, completely lacked character. It was just soupy spiciness.
5. The rice and beans were half decent.
6. The atmosphere was dull, uninspired and completely empty on a Sunday evening.
7. It cost $30 to feed two adults and two kids, which is about the same price we would spend at Chipotle. Not a real bargain from my standpoint.
8. The only good thing: The food was not as much a salt-lick as other fast food restaurants.

Still, I don't see a reason to ever go there again."}
{"text":"Federico's is certainly good for a cheap Mexican place. I place it well above any of the 'bertos places I've tried. You get quite a bit of food for your money especially on Tuesdays, where some of the tacos and burritos are $1 or $2.

The Green Chili Burrito is my favorite item on the menu by far with the Carne Asada Fries following a close second. I wouldn't recommend getting the Green Chili burrito to go if you have more than a 4 or 5 minute drive home as the sauce will ultimately soak through and you'll be left with a fairly soggy (yet very tasty!) mess in your wrapper. Eat this quick for best results or be prepared to use a fork if you hit any red lights on the way home.

As Jon K. said below, the drive through is a nightmare. This is by far the most consistently slow drive through I've ever seen. If there are any other cars in the drive through, you should head inside and place your order.

This isn't meant to be an extremely fancy place. It's like a cleaner Filiberto's that smells a lot nicer and has much better food."}
{"text":"I can't wait until more fast food options open up around cotton. the only reason I go here any more is for the convenience in location. I'm a pretty easy person to please seeing as how my order usually ranges from tacos to bean and cheese burritos...Last time I went I got charged $1.88 for extra cheese, came home and opened my burrito up and what would you know, absolutely no cheese. I never get my sauces and always have to turn back around..It's so frustrating coming here. I am always SO polite, I speak clearly when I order, and still..Never get my order correct."}
{"text":"Always hot and tasty! My favorites include the Mexican juices and super nachos! But I can say it's all great!"}
{"text":"Greasy ass breakfast burritos sucked and gave me some serious acid shits. You know the kind that feel like you are shooting fire out of your ass? I want to go back this place to try something different because I live close but every time I even drive near it to go to Safeway or the gym my butthole puckers up and my stomach starts to hurt. Sorry Federico's..you have won this round but eventually I will get drunk and come over at 2am and you can try to redeem yourselves."}
{"text":"Finally, North Scottsdale has a fast food Mexican restaurant!!! Not Sure if it ever really needed one?? Okay food, Nothing that stands out... I tried their Signature Carne' Asada Taco's and a Cheese Quesadilla with their Grilled chicken... Good choices.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to get there, I just happen to have to drive past it, at least twice a day during the week, and still have only been there on one occasion.  I would agree with another reviewer, the staff is indifferent, and does act like  you are intruding on their time."}
{"text":"My burrito was cold I just live behind community of the hospital and doesn't take 5 seconds for burrito to get cold and the said that it was guacamole that got it cold. No the guacamole doesn't make the whole Tortilla cold"}
{"text":"The place is delicious, the food is sold for a great price, but it's really slow. If you have a company that has a drive thru, you know very well how fast people want to get their food. There's a reason they're not going inside, so why should customers be stuck in line for about 5 or more minutes per car?? It makes no sense. This is really irritating and is something that needs to be brought to attention"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I ordered a grilled chicken salad in it so it was supposed to come with avocado I got home and there was no avocado the manager claims that he put avocado on my salad. Instead of putting my name down he made me come all the way back down. He was down right rude, unprofessional and should not be running a restaurant by no means. He would not give me his name or any of the stores information, he ignored me and I had to ask his employee. I do not recommend this place to anyone. I will travel down to rolibertos in a heart beat off greenway and grand."}
{"text":"Menudo is sweet and a little spicy. Comes with corn or flour tortillas and the fixings, lemon wedges, oregano and chopped onion. Not stingy with the scoops and I got a lot of everything. Have myself a bowl maybe once a month. Sometimes experiment and order something different. It is good and hits the spot."}
{"text":"He food was okay nothing very exciting. I did enjoy my chili Reno. The chicken tacos were good. This is a self serve restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a Chicken Taco Combo for 6.19 which included 2 Hard \"Red Chicken\" Tacos with Rice & Beans. I added a large homemade lemondae & apparently they charge a .50 fee for any card transaction so my final total was 9.44. It was well worth it. Tacos were seasoned well I felt were overstuffed in chicken but I pulled it out and munched later in the meal. The rice & beans were plentiful. I had no leftovers but I did not eat anymore for the rest of the day. Completely filling. My first experience was wonderful. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Great food, but my order gets messed almost every time up.
Today, Arizona burrito was missing and 2 sides of guacamole MIA....
Last visit my French fries were MIA......
I wouldn't mind but it gets expensive ordering food you never get!!!
Going to trying some other Mexican restaurants in the area because this is getting old!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks Taco Bell is way better and a lot more fresh they need to close this business down worst in buckeye"}
{"text":"Service was horrible I returned my order after waiting  for about 10 minutes for a torta while the place only had about 5 people inside.  It seemed every person returned their order because they forgot something.  The taste is bland and average and super greasy.  I couldn't finish my meal"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican fast food place in Surprise,AZ.The food is really good but the prices can get a little high and the portion is not as great as other Mexican Fast Food places. 4 Stars because of the great food."}
{"text":"Was a little nervous due to the mixed reviews but gave them a shot - and very good! Had carne Asada fries, rolled tacos, chips and pico, fish tacos & beef tacos. Everything tastes fresh, no greasy messes found! Plenty of guac! They definitely didn't  skimp. Hubby wished for more stuff on the tacos like sour cream and tomatoes, but other than that everything was great. Even on a Saturday night with a line of cars on the drive through we had our order quick. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times. It's not bad. A little inconsistent. I enjoy the ceviche tostada. Not a fancy place but worth the money. Good for fast food Mexican."}
{"text":"Love their food.  Generous servings and best flan I have tasted in years.  Basically a drive through and the employees do not speak much English, but who cares the food is great."}
{"text":"This wasn't what I was expecting when I picked it, and I was a little disappointed it was \"fast food,\" but then pleasantly surprised to see the menu options and taste the food. It was a great combination of pretty authentic, fresh Mexican, served in a quick manner. The chips (chips & salsa) were hot, fresh and crispy!! Best I've had in a long while. I had the crispy grilled taco salad and it was very \"fresh\" as well. I tried a bite of another member of our groups shredded beef burrito and it was fantastic. First visit was a success, and if we lived in the area or find ourselves visiting again, I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day it's a nice new place nice paint very clean inside and out, spacious place , the staff seemed to be dressed nice in some type of uniform / shirts they had on. Also the food that I ordered which was a breakfast burrito came timely it was a little more expensive than I thought it would be but overall the service was good I also had some rolled tacos another day and I'm noticing that the food all the good food is not spicy it seems not as spicy as I've had in the past at similar places. Drive Thru was not operational yet but hopefully in the near future that would be great, staff was friendly"}
{"text":"OMG. First time I've been here. Had a large (work) lunch to order, figured I'd go inside. HORRIBLE idea. It was 113 degrees outside, and 94 inside OMG. I about died. It took forever for the food to be ready. 

The employees are friendly though, and very welcoming. Maybe, I'll hit this place up again, and change my review. Until then, DON'T EAT INSIDE!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Carne Asada Burrito and two Carne Asada Tacos. The Burrito was well served and and flavor was delicious. The tacos no difference, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for breakfast....had burrito with \"chorizo\"....95% egg 5% \"chorizo\"....nuff said will not return."}
{"text":"Very very good quick Mexican. Eat in or drive thru. My favs are the carnitas taco, shredded beef burrito, and the refried beans. Food always come out piping hot. We usually get stuff to go as we live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Disgusting place with shit quality food and ignorant customer service. If you want real authentic Mexican food I highly recommend salsitas on jackrabbit near the circle k."}
{"text":"People do not know how great this place is. The employees are super sweet and the food is super yummy! Thanks Angelica for being the real MVP!"}
{"text":"I know these places get a bad rap all the time but this one here is delicious!

My hubby and I stopped by here after the ASU win on Saturday (GO ASU) and just picked up a few tacos. 

They were delicious and hit the spot. I had a beef taco and he had two chicken tacos. Very filling for an after game snack and for around $7 you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican fast foods restaurant,  prices are fair and servings are great. Taco Bell,  Del Taco pale in comparison.  Has regular employees that are good to us regulars. As a family we eat there atleast once a week.  Great deals on tacos and burros on Monday s and Tuesdays. Student specials too"}
{"text":"We used 2 go here 4 a l8 night or early morning quick fix, but have noticed a lot of cutting corners going on 4 awhile. While prices have increased (as they always will) the quality & quantity of food has decreased. 

   Burritos that used 2 b huge/fat have been consistently getting skimpier each time we ordered, consisting mostly of the folds of a huge tortilla instead of being filled. The sauces & even the pina/horchata drinks have been watered down significantly. Combin8ion pla8es many times had overly refried, old tasting, thick dried out beans w/ guacamole & sour cream being less each time or 4gotten completely. Red & green sauce cups have now become flavored salt Water (which news~flash over~salting doesn't hide it)! WTH is the deal w/ finding Meat in NON~MEAT orders EVERY SINGLE TIME?? EWWW, that's a HUGE DISGUSTING No~No 4 Veg~Heads 2 discover such when ordering the very limited items we have 2 choose from on ur menu as it is!!

   It won't b likely, but we may decide 2 give them a try in a very distant future if ever feeling desper8 enough 2 take another gamble after losing a bit 2 much 2 many Xs worth of visits now! More cost 4 @ least the same we used 2 get woulda been alright, but we can't justify paying MORE 4 LESS in food, service & quality as that's a RIP~OFF!! Such a shame, but MAYBE they'll improve ~ not holding breath as I don't wanna b called Smurfette..."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Can't go wrong with the bean burrito!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for your late night Carne Asada Fries fix! Trust me! ;) Haha We can here late on New Years Eve night and it tasted like heaven.  On the other sober nights we couldn't find anything as good as that!"}
{"text":"We frequent this place often enough to have tried several of the menu items. All have been awesome! The manager is super friendly every time we have gone in and plus military gets free drinks! Way to go Fredericos!  Breakfast burritos rock too so go in the morning too or order one any other tine as the menu is available all day which is nice."}
{"text":"definitely a place to come when you're drunk because the food is not very tasty Meathead weird texture almost crunchy like not in a good way like all fat tortillas or undercooked so they were yuck girl's nice though try to help and how much she can won't go back"}
{"text":"Well, I've gone back to Federico's several times since my last review and they seem to have improved.  Thank God that RUDE lady doesn't appear to be working there anymore, that's a plus!  Service is much better and even though the Monday-thru-Wednesday price of the tacos has gone up from $0.99 to $1.25, I still gotta have 'em, they're too good!  The flavor of their red sauce has changed for the better, and I like it more than the green sauce now.

If I could knock 'em on anything, I'd say that the restaurant needs to invest in a good salad spinner because the lettuce is way too freakin wet.  I like that fresh lettuce on my tacos, but I've had to start ordering it on the side or forgoing it altogether.  I'd prefer that they just make it right.  I absolutely can't stand opening my box to find my once-crispy tacos swimming in water and sauce, and after reading these comments about their refusal to admit their mistakes, I just might have to take another break from them if the situation doesn't improve."}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for amazing Mexican food since we moved to Arizona. You would think that Mexican food would be comparable to that of California because of it's location, but that is definitely not the case. It's been disappointment after disappointment. Service was prompt; however, food was bland. My burrito was full of carne asada; however, it was flavorless. Thank goodness that I took my meal to go. It allowed me to add carne asada seasoning, improving the taste of the meal. No rice or beans in my burrito either. Don't go. It's not worth your money! Stay home and make your own carne asada burritos."}
{"text":"When I need Mexican in a pinch and don't want to walk in and order. I've only ever had the rolled tacos, pretty much the only thing I ever order at these fast food Mexican restaurants. Don't know why though but that's not the point haha. They are big, crispy and filled with a decent amount of meat. Comes with sour cream, cheese and guacamole on the top and rice and beans on the side. I don't know why but I really don't care for the guacamole. It tastes gross and overly processed. My mom makes guacamole from scratch and it definitely does not taste like avocados at all. Keep forgetting to tell them to take it off but that's my fault. Overall it's a great place for Mexican on the go. I prefer Mi Familia down the road but they don't have a drive-thru. Makes it hard to get good food with groceries in the car during summer time."}
{"text":"OMG! 
Just moved to the neighborhood a week or so ago and had a craving for fish tacos. I knew this place was up the street so I stopped in on my way home from work.
The Fish Taco plate was reasonably priced at $6.19. The little waitress at the drive-thru window was a doll. Asking if I wanted hot sauce I responded that I  wanted the hotest they had.  She gave me both the red and the green telling me that heat was relative and to try both. Fair enough.
When I got home and opened the to-go container I was greeted to 2 HUGE tacos and a generous portion if refried beans and rice. I tried the beans first, cause in my book it you can't get the refried beans right the rest if the meal with most likely suck.
Lemme tell you...these were the most flavorful refried beans I've ever had! Anywhere. Including my own.
This was going to be a great meal!!
The fish tacos were made of cod fried in a light batter with pico de gallo, shredded cabbage, and a spicy cream sauce. Heaven! The best I've had since Denver!
The meal was so good I finished the entire container, and that never happens.
Try this little Mexican place, I can only imagine everything on the menu us this good. And trust me, I will be trying everything!"}
{"text":"Depends what you are in the mood for, but for $3-5 for a good sized carne asada or breakfast burrito, it's hard to beat. This is by no means 'traditional' Mexican food though. It is good. It is 24hr. It's not going to win any authentic or best of XYZ awards, but if your looking for a burrito fix, hangover remedy, or just something cheap - this is your place."}
{"text":"We have been regular customers for years. Went in on Thursday and ordered meals for everyone, went home to eat and no one liked anything and the meat had a wierd taste.  Went to say something on Friday and was treated like crap.  We will never be going back. It is really sad after many years of enjoing their food and it came down to one bad night and being treated like crap to ruin that."}
{"text":"The food is ok but much of it is quite greasy. The service is either deaf or apathetic. Even if I tell them \"give me a minute\" they'll still keep asking \"u ready to order or do u need a minute?\" One time she even kept saying \"hello, hello\" like she couldn't hear anything I said. Been going here for 4 years but at first when this started I thought she must have bad earphones or something but now every time I go back, I'm in the drive they for 10 seconds before she keeps asking again! 
She acts like she hears NOTHING! Even after I order-shel say! \" u ready to order now! I know she can hear me bc she only starts talking when I'm NOT! The previous times since this started my order has been wrong EVERY TIME! Today she won't even acknowledge anything I say, even after I ordered and said that's all I wanted, she kept asking rudely if I needed a minute and \"are u ready to order!\" So I just drove thru and went somewhere else to eat!
They never tell u what ur total is until after u get to the window either! 
They really don't give a crap!"}
{"text":"Quick lunch today here and it didn't disappoint. It's located in a strip mall with a nice outdoor dining patio. 

As soon as we walked in a friendly face greeted us and steered us to the menu. Look up everyone as there's a whole lot of Mexican going on.

My hubby got his usual shredded beef taco plate and I tried the carnitas plate. 

The food came out within 5 minutes and was piping hot. The beans and rice looked and tasted fresh.

My carnitas came with yummy corn tortillas and an ample amount of guacamole and carnitas meat. The only thing that needed improvement were the carnitas itself. I asked the nice lady who rung up our order if the carnitas were tender and she said they were. I was hoping and dreaming of tender pork strips so soft that they would melt in my mouth. The carnitas were a combination of chewy and a few pieces were a bit burned. Not the kind of carnitas I was dreaming about but it was edible.

As far as my hubby's order, he liked the tacos and were satisfied with them and would like to try them again.

They also had a lot of nice salads and shrimp on the menu too and I believe the next time we come here, I'll try those out as the quality of the food was good.

Besides the carnitas needing to be more tender, the only other thing I would do to improve the dining experience is to maybe not mop up the dining area while the diners are eating. There's something to be said about a clean restaurant but the Pinesol smell got a bit overwhelming while we were eating our food.

Looking forward to our next visit and trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Just OK!!! Had ALOT BETTER!!!  But I guess the price and open 24hrs. Helps this place stay in bussiness!!! I must say waitress was good and served fast!!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. Stale tortillas and the same size as a 99¢ burrito at Taco Bell. So disappointed I stopped here"}
{"text":"As quick service Mexican food goes, Federico's hits the spot. What I find ironic is when this was a KFC, I would see cockroaches crawling all over the drive-through when I was nearby, and now that its a \"hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint\" its infinitely cleaner. 

Late night drunken carne asada fries? Check!

Tasty adobada burrito? Check! 

Rolled tacos smothered in guac and cheese? You know it!

Prices are reasonable, quality is consistent and good, and flavor is never lacking"}
{"text":"My goodness, this place is pretty awesome for some fast mexican food. It's pretty authentic and reasonably priced. I typically get the chicken chimichanga when I go, which I think, is around $8-10. It is ready within 5 minutes, and it is HUGE. Think chipotle burrito size. The only downside is that I'm a picky meat eater and sometimes pieces of the chicken gross me out, cause I prefer complete white chicken breast without all the extra stuff, but they add the extra stuff. But it doesn't stop me from going here when I'm famished and dying from mexican food. Plus, this location is specifically awesome and more dine-in friendly than the other locations I have seen out here in AZ."}
{"text":"Oooooh Federico's, how I love thee"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and they never disappoint.  On Monday's and Tuesday's  the burritos are $2.50 and tacos are $1.25.  The Horchata tastes a little bit watery or they would have got a 5 star."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service and awful food. 
We are sorry we tried it. 
I went saturday 03.04.2017 at 12:30 pm and ordered 2 mixed burritos... Never will i visit that restaurant again."}
{"text":"Disgusting!  We ordered food at Federico's on 12/21.  In the past we had been here before and had a bad experience but figured we would give it one more try.  We ordered a sausage and egg breakfast burrito.  The burrito was awful - greasy tortilla, burnt eggs, and very little sausage all for $6 which it was not worth. 

Later in the day, we both became sick from eating this burrito!  We had not eaten anything else.  We will not be going back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Place is good for fast food, Clean inside. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"This place has just about everything you would expect from an authentic Mexican restaurant. Food is great and service is good as well. The service is good and no mistakes in our order. One thing that I would change is the super cheap plastic silverware that is unusable.  Still a"}
{"text":"Finally, North Scottsdale has a fast food Mexican place...something most other neighboring cities take for granted. The food and service is always consistently good, a great value, and definitely fills that Mexican craving you just seem to get every week or so. And it's drive-through that's open late!

The quesadillas are huge, filled with melty cheese and grilled meat of your choice. The combos are delicious, and the burritos include several breakfast options served all day. The food is freshly prepared at order time, and might take a few minutes. Everything I've tried I have liked and would (and have) order again, except for the Chile Relleno burrito...but then I'm not a real relleno fan to begin with. 

The Super Nachos are piled high with grilled carne asada and guacamole, and serve as a great shareable appetizer for several people. The pork Carnitas and Adobada combinations are very flavorful, and come with your choice of flour or corn tortilla with rice and beans. The Fish Tacos are a solid choice, as is the Fish Burrito, with a nice balance of fish, fresh pico, and tartar sauce. All of the breakfast burritos are worth trying, but my favorite is the Ham and Cheese with their green salsa on the side...simple and delicious all day long. 

A real find that adds to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is saving my days when I have no time to cook... I order number 21, the pollo Asada  plate and is enough for two adults and a kid. My favorite one is number 22 but that's only for me!!!!! I am glad KFC is gone and this took its place. One thing for sure, I always check my order when I am drive thru and if is something wrong they fix it right away! The food is tasty!"}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch for the first time and was helped at the counter by the owner. Great guy that ran me through the menu, all the specials and even caught I am in the military and offered me a free drink. I went with his recommendation of a chicken burrito with guac and pico which was fantastic. Horchata was very good as were the beans and rice.

Highly recommend for great food, great service and very military friendly. Place was packed and had a lot of regulars that knew the owner and the owner knew them."}
{"text":"This place is the opposite of fast food drive thru restaurant. The food is good thought but everything else EVERYTHING ELSE! sucks here, including the furniture and lousy employees. Are they even food handler certified?
This place manager or owner needs to take note of how slow they are to serve you the food. 
They have no idea of what a fast food restaurant is. None!
2 stars because if the good food."}
{"text":"OK....been back (2) more times to this Federico's (in Surprise).  The customer service has been outstanding.  The restaurant has been clean.  Food has been hot, and took others advice and stuck to the tacos.......Holy Frijole!  THEY ARE AWESOME!  Got the shredded beef tacos with an Horchata.......I am SO WOW'd by these (2) visits, that they made me take the time to update my initial review/impression from a 2-star to a 4-star.  The people working there, the service, the Tacos...well....YEP, HAPPY!"}
{"text":"I only ordered ONE item at this Federico's and there were NO other cars or customers and it took the woman forever to bring my food to me at the drive through. There was hardly any chicken on the pollo asado five mini tacos and they charged me over $7.00 for them with tax. They were cold and mostly hard pieces of grizzle. Horrible service and horrible food. EXTREMELY displeased.  Will NEVER waste my time or money there again."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this location.  They have a new burrito with chile relleno and steak which was excellent.  However, the staff made it 5 stars, by being friendly and efficient.  For $7 I had a fresh tasty lunch in a place I felt welcome."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a handful of times and although the drive thru line is always long, it is all well worth it! They give me a meal deal without a drink and charge me less; I can't say the same for the Federicos on Cave Creek. The also give me tiny sides of rice and beans..again, the other location does not! Score for this location and the awesome customer service and giving the customer what they want!!"}
{"text":"Has by far one of the best carne asada fries, it's close by to where I live and it is easy to make a quick stop through drive by, they provide a very good amount of toppings on the fries especially with the carne asada meat and sour cream. I ate here several times and the place has never failed to provide good food."}
{"text":"Jesus is the sweetest guy ever! he went out of my way to help me out and fix my tacos since I'm allergic to guacamole. best service, super sweet guy."}
{"text":"Food here is really good, and at a really good price. Best nachos, and burrito I've had from a drive through!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru with 5 cars in front of me so figured it must be good. Total wait time in line was only about 15 minutes. Service was very friendly and accurate. Our order for 4 people was only $21. The beans and rice were some of the best I've had in comparison to nearby Mexican restaurants.  Ordered a burrito with a homemade tortilla, texture/flavor comparable to Carolinas (my favorite Mexican food restaurant). I'd suggest the shredded chicken over the grilled, FYI.  Tostadas are huge, tasty, and filling!  Food was great except for chips...way to salty! Everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"We just happened to find this place. Excellent food, huge variety, extremely pleasant staff. We had the street tacos, the El Rey burrito x2, and carne asada nachos. Everything was very fresh  with superior taste."}
{"text":"I won't be back.  First time I went was good.   Shrimp burrito and carne asada tacos were very good.  Husband had the combo with 2 scene asada burritos.   First time we loved it.  Went back, and will not be returning.  New ordered the exact same thing.  Got home, mind you we only live a few mins away.  My tacos were cold.  Meet was not warm at all.  Husband said his was just okay.   Took one bite of my shrimp taco
Burrito and spit it out.   It was shredded beef burrito not shrimp.  I hate shredded beef, not to mention it was dried up and burnt beef.   I contacted them thru their Facebook page the following day.   They responded 3 days later and wanted my contact info to relay to the store.   Haven't heard hide nor hair from them since.  To me, that is horrible customer service.  I will take my business elsewhere.   thank you very much"}
{"text":"I have gone through the drive thru twice in the past 2 weeks and will likely not be back. The food is very average and overpriced. Do not expect to pay the prices you see on their online menu (each item is about $2 more here in Scottsdale). Also the second time I came here they could not get my order right (it wasn't even difficult- I ordered 3 items without any modifications). 

I ordered the carne asada fries which were not very good for $9.  The sour cream they put on it tasted old.  The fries were also soggy and would have benefited from being cooked longer.  I've also tried their breakfast items which were very average (but how can you mess up eggs). Do not order the chorizo, mine had bones in it and they put so much oil in it that it was overwhelming.  My dad ordered the chimichanga plate and was not impressed and he is easy to impress.  The serving size is very large but you can tell the ingredients are not fresh or good quality.

Maybe I'll come back for a Mexican Soda or horchata but definitely no more food."}
{"text":"I don't typically care for 'berto's-type Mexican restaurants.

But some days, I get up and don't feel like cooking breakfast, or I'm out of eggs or whatever. 

I can rely on Federico's to serve up a good version my favorite breakfast burrito: potato and egg, AKA, the \"country\".

Believe it or not, it's easy to screw up something so simple. But Federico's gets it right -- fluffy eggs, browned but not greasy potatoes -- all good."}
{"text":"This place sucks always get order wrong and dont want to fix it also got mold on tortilla  and they said it was ok"}
{"text":"Very good fast food Mexican food!  The prices are great and the \"locals\" eat there.  You know you have a gem when the palace is full of Mexicans having lunch there!  Very clean inside and bright.  The adobada and carne asada is very good and the chicken quesadilla is great!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this place has saved the day more times than I can count on my
Fingers. We always want food when nothing is open and Federico's always comes through. The food is always amazing. We love the carne Asada fries and I always get the enchiladas. We bring so many people to this place and I have not once heard a negative thing about anything on the menu"}
{"text":"Its was 1 am on a sunday night Monday morning when í decided to stop by at this place.
After being greeted i placed an order for super nachos, the young lady was amazing she explained what the nachos came with and made sure my order was correct, after having this Type of service, í waited for my order which didn't take long. I drove home and btw í only LITERALLY ONLY LIVE ABOUT 2 MINUTES AWAY and to my surprise my carne asada wasn't Hot nor even close to warm, the cheese wasn't melted and the beans were barely warm.
I'm not at all going to stop by any time soon!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so idk what all these other people are talking about.. Besides, their reviews are fairly old. I was here twice in the past week. I know what GOOD authentic Mexican food taste like. Now, I've only tried the carne asada burrito, twice. It is so delicious! Cooked w/ love, for sure! The horchata is super yummy also. I've dealt w/ several employees. For the most part they were all kind and helpful. The only rude person I dealt w/ was over the phone and late at night. There's probably a reason they give him graveyard shift, but can you blame him? That shift sucks. Either way, my food was good. The place was clean and bathroom was decent enough for my toddler to use. P.S. The green salsa is so good!!!"}
{"text":"I love this joint. Thank goodness it's so close to my house! I go here anytime I need a little mexican food fix. Good burro's, good tacos, good nachos. Infact, it's really all good food. I think monday and tuesday are $.99 tacos or burros. MMMmmm."}
{"text":"Good food, large burritos but they're very expensive.  Mexican food is inexpensive to make. Maybe their rent is high because of their location. Way better than Filbertos."}
{"text":"This place is great. Besides what has already been mentioned, their attention to my request are outstanding. They always make my special order perfect. Except one time. But thats cause I sent someone to get it for me so, could have been the messenger. Super clean, fresh, friendly but not fake. A great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito was awesome!  Service was fast, prices were fair and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with a few friends. Never been here before. The burritos are such a nice portion size. So large!! Salsa is a great addition to any of their dishes. The tamarindo juice is a great addition to your breakfast. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Normally I like Federico's but the last two times I've been on Taco Tuesday and had the worst tacos ever.  They must be using oil that isn't hot enough because the taco shells come out dripping with oil, hard (not crispy) and impossible to bite. 

Might just be a Taco Tuesday thing...I'll give them one more try on a non-Tuesday to see if its better.  If not, sad to say won't be coming back. 

The staff is friendly though!"}
{"text":"They have a drive threw!! When I crave a taco this is where I go. Always fast and friendly!! Real Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Go to Taco Bell. The food there is better. Honestly I can't remember the last time I felt this way about an eatery.  I will tolerate some pretty sh#%tty food, but I think this place might take the cake. Choked down a half of burrito and my gf ate about a quarter of taco enchilada combo. Seriously go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was happy when i see they were building a Federico's so close to my house. I went there twice and ordered the same thing both times. The food was good but the size of the burritos are very small compared to other Federico's i have tried. I will continue to go to Rivas instead. gotta drive a few blocks farther but will feel like i am getting my money's worth."}
{"text":"Not good. Enchiladas weren't even heated, tostada shell was stale, soda was flat.

We won't bother going back."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. I had the shredded beef enchiladas and they were really good. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Federico's is probably the best fast food Mexican place I've been too. Actually is better than some of the sit down restaurants I've been to. Their burritos are great and taco salad is awesome. They have lunch specials everyday so make sure you check the menus for that."}
{"text":"In the tradition of Southern California's Filibertos, we have the new Federicos here in Scottsdale. Gotta' say- Very solid! We had a 2 for one combo coupon, so we got 3 combos and shared. Enchiladas were pretty good, but the 2 burrito (carne asada type meat) combo was fantastic. The 3 combo plates ended up being lunch, dinner, and snack for the 2 of us. The portions are HUGE here. I didn't really care for the carne asada fries, as I am not into the American version either: chili cheese fries (a pile of greasy mush, to me). It was prepared all right, just not my thing. The place really needs some decor, a TV, ANYTHING to liven it up a bit! It's very boring on the inside! They do have a few tables on the patio, and there is drive up service as well. As in other places of this sort, they have a fill your own salsa bar, with delicious & spicy red and green salsas. It'd be nice if they had 2 more flavors. Food is really good, portions are gigantic, so overall it gets 4 stars from me. Just needs some ambience... Tunes, TV, wall art, etc."}
{"text":"Food, service, price and speedy service are actually a ***** star. As there is no indoor area plus it's in the hood, four is still very good. Use the drive through rather than the walk up window!"}
{"text":"Just started working near by and thought i'd stop by for lunch . I loved their service, meals were made quick and yet so delicious ! The thing i liked the most was the fact that they have mexian soda  keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"terrible service and cold soggy food waited at drive through window for approximately 10 minutes before they bothered to open. got order wrong twice. 2 steak tostada and 2 orders of rice. very difficult order it's totally understandable drove home 5 minutes and food was cold the record beans color was not Brown
more whitish. 
never going back"}
{"text":"I really like the Arizona burrito and the super nachos. I wish the nachos were a little cheaper and I don't like how small the to go container is I don't feel like it is worth paying for the full order of nachos when the container isn't much larger then the half order."}
{"text":"Disgusting meat was found in my burritos..    the enchiladas were Ice cold.   Olivia was very rude and didn't get my whole order right.  Not that hard to put cheese on the side.  The food was horrible as well. Very nasty meat.  This place needs new management or management who can address the problems and new employees who can take orders correctly"}
{"text":"Pretty cheap and authentic. They offer real Mexican dishes like menudo and lengua. They also offer seafood like shrimp and fish tacos/burritos etc. their menu is big and the service is fast. The portion sizes are very generous. I didn't finish all of my menudo. Usually I can eat till it hurts, but the portions were very generous. They have a drive thru window. The place is open till midnight every night-even on a Sunday. I'll be back to try the lengua."}
{"text":"Went inside on Saturday morning and ordered the Country Breakfast burrito. I added rice to the potatoes, cheese and eggs and my total was about 6 bucks for a very large breakfast which half the burro is still sitting in frig. Everything seemed freshly made to order and the ingredients all tasted nice. With no meat inside, it was hard to mess this burrito up, so it was a nice, no worry about what is inside my breakfast. Extra points for free chips on the counter and a decent green sauce was served on the side, more thick than than normal. Great radish and cucumbers as well."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  Food is more expensive than most fast food places.  All 3 times I visited,staff would start sweeping, kicking up nasty floor dust that one knows drifts into tour food & lungs.  Asked them to stop.  So, the proceeded to mop floor with disinfectant, which makes food unappetizing.  Any manager knows that if they are not an idiot.  there's are idiots.  Ordered \"Fish & Chips\" and it came with Mexican \"taco chips\"!!!  Are Mexican-American restaurant owners that stupid not to know \"Fish & Chips\" and a British food and \"Chips\" mean \"POTATOES'...like FRENCH FRIES?  When I brought this to the attention of the cashier, she was dumbfounded and didn't understand English...probably an illegal.  I asked her if she's ever ordered \"Fish & Chips\" at other restaurants, and she, \"No.\". ( That was a give-away that she's an ignorant illegal.  The cook overheard us, & started laughing.  He shouted, while chuckling, through the window, \"Yeah, the  restaurant owners think \"Chips\" mean salsa chips, so that's what they make us serve.\". I said, \"They must be ignorant because salsa chips do not go with deep fried fish like fries do.  that is not what fish & chips mean.  It's like ordering a hamburger, and you get a slice of ham in a bun or cooked canine in a bun for a hot dog. They sound like idiots!\". He laughed & acknowledged by nodding his head affirmatively. Lastly, I ordered 3 of their taco before 11 pm.  I arrived home & only found 2 in the sack.  I immediately called to let them know, so, that I could get credit for a taco & since I live very close to this location, I could return to get it'd replacement & thinking I'd order something else because I was still hungry.  So, I called & was told by the young cashier that she would have to call the manager to get approval first, because the night shift supervisor was the person who packed my order which had to have been accurate, insinuating that I was attempting to rip them off for a $1.25 taco.  I asked her if she was seriously going to call their store's manager, who was probably asleep, over a $1.25 taco?  You've got to be kidding me?  She wanted my name & phone number so she could call me back to inform me if it was okay or not to come back to pick up the taco I was shorted,  I never heard back, so, I've never returned.  This restaurant has problems with their systems in place.  Maybe because it is somewhat newly opened. But, after 6+ months, you'd think they would be better than they are.  also, the times I've been their, the salsa bar looked very unclean, bins were empty, and there were bubbled in the cucumber bin on the cucumber slices, indicating bacteria growing or soap.  I informed them that the carrot slice bin was totally empty.  At no time while I was there eating, did they refill it.  I did ask the young man sweeping & creating dust, not to come anywhere near us to sweep while we were eating.  He obliged, but, then brought out the disinfecting mop which was so strong that it killed our taste buds.  I told him that part of the body's enjoyment of eating is because of the nose's senses which affects our taste buds. The Pinesol smelling mopping was doing just that.  The overwhelming odor of the mop cleaner, made our food seem tasteless.  I asked him why he's doing this while the place has customers and not wait until there are no customers?  He responded with I do it because I am told to do it.  Well, if they want to chase off customers, that is their business.  Both times I dined in, this occurred.  The 3rd time, I chose to take out, & that's when I was shorted a taco.  I have given up on them."}
{"text":"Very rude service. My 7 yr old ordered a chicken taco salad. When it came out it was swimming in liquid. So disgusting. I took it to the counter to show them and both girls seemed dumbfounded. One told me that it's the chicken juices from cooking. Unless they are cooking raw chicken in a taco shell, no way. The girl never offered an apology and instead starts defending the food. I finally told her we weren't going to eat (or drink) the taco salad and I wanted something else. I could tell the girl was not happy about that.

There was also a mystery liquid on our tacos but I decided after my experience with the taco salad I would just suck it up and just never go back again. My husband even noted to me he was afraid of food safety. We have gone to other locations and things were fine.

We were so excited to see a federicos come in by our house but I'd rather eat gas station food than deal with such crappy service."}
{"text":"I eat here twice a week (sometimes more). 

Love the carne asada in absolutely anything but I really like the Arizona Burrito or the Super Nachos."}
{"text":"Very good! I really like that they're opened late, especially on a weekday after work. Quick, easy and good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Good affordable food, large portions. Love the sausage burrito. 
Always received good service to date."}
{"text":"Bean and Country burritos are very tasty.  Sauces are tasty too.  Good place for fast Mexican food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They have the BEST Grilled Chicken tacos and the BEST verde salsa. Everything taste good though! They are always friendly and the prices are not bad either. If I could change one thing, I would want the drive through to be a little faster, but it is well worth the wait!! We get the cheese enchiladas the chicken and regular quesadillas and the grilled chicken tacos about once a week for our family. The kids like it and so do our wallets!"}
{"text":"got food this afternoon waited forever in the drive through. when i got home I realized the did not give me my drink and sitting down to eat realized I got something different than my order. Decided to try it till i realized there was shrimp in it and do not eat shrimp
. Thanks for the waste of food and money"}
{"text":"So I've been coming here for years and have never had any issues until today. I ordered what I've always ordered. A bean burrito, a taco and a drink. It cost over $9 dollars!! The lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. She asked if I wanted a bean and cheese burrito. Well obviously I said yes I want cheese in it. The price on the menu said it was like $2.50. There was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. So I pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. I said, I'm sorry how much?? So I'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong. Also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! Told them I will never be back!! I can get better food at Taco Bell and more food for the same price!! They don't false advertise there either! Furious!  Their food and prices have gone downhill fast! They lost mine and my family's business for good!!"}
{"text":"DON'T TRUST THIS PLACE!

Their carne asada quesadilla is $2.50 more than their carna asada burrito which they state when asked has the same.amount of meat and is the same tortilla even if it has a little more cheese it's not $2.50 worth. Every taco shop like this I've been two has the two priced exaxtithey same or within a dime of each other. If they are overpricing this what else are they hiding???"}
{"text":"If I could give it a -10 I would. I ordered 2 burritos with extra sour cream and guccamole. They charged me for it and did not put it in the burritos. When I called to let them know. They hung up on me... cheap ass Mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"Much prefer Ramiros!  Two times they have messed up my order.  :-(  This time, I order a side of rice (from 'sides' on the menu) & got a micro-side...like 2 tblspn.  Seriously!  They just don't seem to pay attention."}
{"text":"This particular location is great!  The service is always excellent and with a smile.  We are always served food that is fresh and hot.  We're always happy to wait a couple extra minutes for our food because it is always served perfectly.  Their tortillas in particular are always soft and delicious."}
{"text":"Late night visit to the drive through. The rolled tacos with guac and cheese were very crispy and tasted good. My cheese quesadilla was just cheddar cheese, but it was large and worth 4 bucks. The side of rice was tiny, so get a pint if you need more. Both sauces were too watery, but the horchata was decent enough."}
{"text":"I love the bean and cheese burritos. The beans don't have lard, and are always fresh. The tortilla is amazing. Super friendly service too. Big portions for the low prices."}
{"text":"Don't really like this place. I've only been through the drive through. The taste is nothing special, kind of bland. I do appreciate that they are open 24/7 though. What a great idea for those late night cravings!"}
{"text":"In the past I would have easily given this restaurant at least three maybe four stars. The last two times I've come here the tacos have barely had any filling and my usual favorite green chili is just bland. Pitiful...probably won't return."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast burritos.  A good selection, but no green chili.  This is not uncommon for Arizona, but definitely wish it was an option.  Otherwise the quality was good."}
{"text":"Decent mexican food.  I like their Monday, $2.50 burrito and Tuesday, $1.25 taco specials.  And go for the salsa, it's legit!"}
{"text":"Okay, the drive through is never really quick but the food is always hot nonetheless - which is why I guess the drive through is not quick!   I am willing to wait - the other day I was really hungry and on the road - grabbed 3 rolled tacos with guacamole - soooo YUM!  We go to  Taco Tuesday often and the carne asada taco, while not 99cents, is a worthy add-on - Cucumber Slices are a great snack while you are waiting for your number to be called."}
{"text":"Still loving Federico's and bringing more friends to share in the great menu!

Keep up the good work and tasty meals!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at this place...ordered a carnitas torts & the carnitas was dry and the torts kept falling apart. The horchata was good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars the last Time we went to this place was a few months ago. I luckily did not get anything to eat, however my brother and mom got a burrito. When he took a bite he yelled \"mom don't eat it\" because disgustingly he almost bit into a cockroach that was wrapped inside the burrito! He immediately threw up and went back to this hell hole telling the lady what happened. The lady then replied \"umm we don't have roaches\" my brother than was like \"really? You're going to make me show you this with all your customers here he than opened the burrito and put it on the counter. The lady immediately gave him his money back and were reported. We've never been back since!"}
{"text":"I was iffy about trying this place because of some of the bad reviews but the husband and I really wanted Mexican food and we didn't want to go far. He ordered the chimichanga combo and I ordered the fish tacos combo. Plus we ordered a side of chips. Everything was delicious when he brought it home. Hot and fresh, even the chips were delicious and warm. We will definitely be going back for some quick Mexican food."}
{"text":"first off, i ordered a cheese enchilada and these werent melted all the way on the inside nor the outside. i couldnt even stomach eating the rest. second, the wait took waaaay too long for the small order we had and it being 12 AM. i wont go here again. making sure the cheese is melted on enchilada isnt hard...."}
{"text":"This is my second trip here. The first time they put guac on my rolled tacos when I asked for only cheese on them. I think their guac tastes gross. Literally some of the grossest guac. The rest of the food was good last time except that... But the service. If you want someone to look at you like their annoyed your there, this is the place for you. Eye rolling when I asked for hot sauce, would not look at me, even when handing me the food. Went back today and ordered 5 rolled tacos, a chorizo special burrito and 2 fish tacos. All tasted okay except the fish tacos. I was super excited about the fish tacos but when I opened them they were beef tacos and they tasted disgusting and the tortillas were stale and over saturated with grease. Again the service was crap, and I was the only person in the drive through so I know it wasn't because they were busy. 
It's quick and easy so I could deal with the food not being \"amazing\" but rude people and never getting the right order? Unacceptable. McDonald's does better than this and I HATE McDonald's."}
{"text":"Has pretty good food but make sure you get the correct change, I gave the girl a 20 she gave me change for a 10 and quickly turned away. I called her on it and she gave me the correct change. I mentioned this is a terrible experience and all I got back were nods and smiles....never an apology.....buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Seriously awesome fast mexican food. Always awesome. The burritos are pretty big for the price as well. Service is friendly and quick. I have been here dozens of times and havent had any issues."}
{"text":"I like that they are open 24 hours. Anytime you want some Mexican food it is always available using the drive through. The place is pretty run down. The building has changed a lot over the years. While it may look run down they have always held \"A\" ratings for cleanliness. They have them clearly displayed on the wall inside. There menu have all of the staples of a Mexican restaurant. What's cool about these places is that you can pretty much as for anything and they can make it for you. On top of that the food tastes good. Their prices are expensive compared to similar restaurants. 

The people here are great. They have never gotten my order wrong.

Be weary of the parking lot, it's in bad shape. Many pot holes. But there is plenty of parking.

Come here to get quick and filling food at anytime, day or night!"}
{"text":"Great Place for Taco Tuesdays!! $2 tacos and they are fantastic"}
{"text":"Not too shabby.  Picked up 4 Street tacos plus a drink for 6 bucks.  Big menu with lots of variety and combo choices."}
{"text":"This is the place you want to go after a night of drinking. The food is typical, delish fast Mexican food. The food is always hot and the drive thru is quick and efficient and the green salsa is amazing. We also love the breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"The wait can be 20 minutes at the drive thru call in your order. Food is yummy. I get tacos and rice."}
{"text":"Carne asada fries are to die for! Good food and addicting, has a good selection of. Mexican food"}
{"text":"Went by today my wife and I both had the combo..... taco, enchilada with rice and beans. Taco was excellent the enchilada had green peppers in it??? WTF I have never had an enchilada with green peppers in it. Beans were really good and rice was okay. I will go back again but probably just stick to the Tacos. Price was $14 for both meals and no drink."}
{"text":"It's a Federico's.  Welcome to surprise!  Now I don't have to drive to goodyear anymore.  Food is tasty, service is quick, and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"All good... if you want better just talk up the Cardinals.
I'm happy to have found this place!"}
{"text":"The best place for fast Mexican food! Hands down the best carne asada fries in the west side!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for chips and salsa between 2 and 5 am. That is just a fact that I must live with. Please believe me when I say that barring any Manuels or  Macayo's being open(which there aren't) that the chips and salsa from Fredericos are the best. Contrary to what many believe this is not a drunk review...yet. The chips are good! Like hot and crispy restaurant style good. Shit ....now I'm hungry. Over the last few years I have sampled close to half of the menu and I'm never disappointed ...believe me I'm accustomed to disappointment at this stop on my journey. Whatever... Try it late night and early morning( 24 hours a day) and I don't think you'll be disappointed either. Damn..I'm hungry now."}
{"text":"Do not eat here i dont know about the ecoli but the foid is awful i ended up throwing mine away! The rice was a gooey clump of crap the cheese wasnt even real cheese and the meat tasted like it was a month old. I can clearly see how they poisioned people nothing is fresh here people!!!"}
{"text":"I was about to give this place four stars, but I'm going with five, hoping to boost the taco joint's overall rating.

I have no idea what these bad reviews are talking about. I have eaten here twice now, and I have had a great experience both times.

I recently moved to Glendale/Peoria from San Diego County, CA. San Diego's kinda famous for its burritos (I don't know if you've heard; they're kind of a big deal) so I have high standards. But I was not disappointed here.

Twice now I've purchased the carne asada fries. The fries are crinkle cut, and the meat is tender. The salsas are great. 

My partner likes the chimichanga plate and the carne asada burrito. Apparently \"the shredded beef in the chimi is perfect, and the shell stays crispy without getting soggy.\" But with the burrito, \"the tortilla is just amazing.\"

Also, prices are great. I fed my whole family - four full grown adults with big appetites - for $30. Definitely coming back whenever we don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"We didn't get sick. It was a busy day, because they were giving away free food (bean & cheese burritos, and green chili burritos), trying to clean their image after the E. Coli outbreak in another of their locations.
It wasn't exactly, it was free! The green chili was just a bit too dry, but I understand that they had to prepare in advance for all the people that was going to show up. So, kudos for them. Great way to advertise."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would have.. we come here because it's close to home but will NEVER be going back. 

Ordered dinner for the family and my quesadilla (10.99) was extremely spicy. INEDIBLE. I went up calmly to the cashier and explained I had no idea how spicy this was and nothing on the menu says it's hot. I didn't want my money back I just wanted to exchange it for something I could eat.

Basically the cashiers were reporting to the cook, his name is Abel, and he was unwilling and rude about exchanging the food. We asked to speak directly to him because we can hear his rude comments in Spanish (I speak Spanish, and heard all he was saying) and he told the cashiers to tell us he wasn't speaking to us! By now I  wanted a refund and he said NO.

Very unprofessional and what a group of rude, unhelpful people. This is no way to treat people that come to your establishment and literally just wanted to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing cheese enchiladas! The beans are fantastic!! I could eat their food morning noon and night if my health and bank account would allow it!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a green chile burrito just now after a night of drinking at Kobalt and I don't know if it's the alcohol or the hunger talking but oh my god! Best burrito ever. It's so super fucken hot that I'm burning my tongue while eating this and it's spicy enough that my nose is slightly. This thing is so good that now I want to see what the rest of their menu has to offer. In fact, I'm asking my boyfriend to drive back around so I can order carne asada fries and a carne asada burrito. I'm excited.

******UPDATE*******

Carne asada kinda sucked. Not gonna lie. It was kinda flavorful yeah, but I'm used to carne asada having that grilled taste and texture. Still. The five star review stands. The carne asada isn't horrible, it's just not what I'm used to."}
{"text":"Gross.....no flavor....expensive and unsanitary looking.  Guac sucked....how could you even mess that up?  Would never go back.  Better tacos at Taco Depot....smh"}
{"text":"Very good! Taco Tuesdays are busy but totally worth the wait. We LOVE the homemade beans and rice. The kiddos also gobble up the cheese roll-up:-)"}
{"text":"Waited at the counter for someone to help me while the staff stood there and gossiped with each other in Espanol.  Finally took my order food came out rather quick. Food was gross.  It was cold and poorly wrapped.  No wonder the place is dead.  Hope to see it fail so something good can have the space."}
{"text":"Good food,  big portions for the price.  Guacamole tasted fine. Closer to Mexican food than taco bell. I'd eat here again.  We had the super nachos and a chimichanga plate. They served more than we could eat."}
{"text":"Sooooo excited that I moved near this place. The food is so good for drive-thru Mexican & the staff is really nice, too. 
The breakfast burritos are delicious, the dinner options are so tasty, and their 'street tacos' are the bomb. Me gusta!"}
{"text":"Okay, before I start I am not racist. My favorite type of food is Mexican Food and I am Mexican, so this is not influenced by racism. I got food here for both breakfast and dinner and both were not pleasant. For breakfast my family and I ordered some burritos at the Drive-Thru, but the star of this story was the bacon and egg burrito. We specified that the burrito be bacon and egg, yet when we got burritos they were STEAK and egg(!). My mom told the lady their mistake and she said that they would fix it. We were given back the burritos and headed home. Once home I took a bite of the burrito and it was STEAK(!)(Again). We went back and had them fix the order and they did. However, the burritos were FILLED with bacon as if they were thinking \"You want bacon; here's bacon!\"
As for dinner we ate inside the restaurant and ordered some shredded beef tacos. The tacos were okay, but they were overflowing with cheese and lettuce, while there was barely any meat at all. (One taco only had meat in the middle). Also the shell had air bubbles. Lastly, the TV's have Mexican channels that rated X. I am not going to go into to detail, but most of the things have to do with not age appropriate things. Overall this was not a good experience and if I want Mexican Food I am going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Another place that goes downhill. This place has gone down from 5 stars to 1 star. Food quality is not the same anymore. Dried overcooked meats is just a no no. It seems they keep everything precooked in the fridge and just heat it up. Not the same quality from 10 months ago. Seems they have tried to save money and its costing them points on the taste department. And the service...JUST HORRIBLE. Crancky ladies taking orders. Give you attitude and make you hesitate to ask for something. That itself makes this a 1 star. Bring back the quality and employees from before!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and have had great service and very good food each time.  Don't mistake good for gourmet.  It's solid fast, mexican food. I usually grab the coupon from val-pak and save a couple of bucks. Nice salsa bar and very clean inside.  Very generous portions!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorites compared to any other Mexican food restaurants. The manager has great customer service and is very respectful. He's always smiling and looks like he's always happy to be there. This restaurant is also very clean and their food is delicious always fresh! I definitely recommend their mini tacos with a side of guacamole. Also, they have these fries called cowboy fries and they are so delicious I would definitely try them. One of my favorite burritos is the bandido, it has a chile relleno, carne asada, beans,rice, guacamole, and cheese. Their prices are reasonable for their sizes, you get a lot of food out of one meal!"}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for bomb nachos this is the place to satisfy my craving! 

I love the super nachos. It comes with pico, guac, sour cream, cheese & carne asada. There's so much 2 people could eat it depends how hungry you are. They also have half nachos too. 

The breakfast burritos are good. 

My brother likes their carne asada fries. 

Also they have by the forks some side items like pickle carrots, onions & salsa. The salsa is good. It's a bit spicy. It kicks in alittle after you eat it. If you want other side items like pico, sour cream, cheese, & guac they do cost extra $1.19 without tax. 

They have deals for high schoolers from 10am-4pm. 

They have a tv inside as well. 

They are open 24/7. 

Also you can order UberEats for your food to be delivered to you."}
{"text":"Honestly I we cannot get enough of this place.  We eat here at least once every couple of weeks.  Super nachos are the bomb!  Customer service is always very good.  When we move from Buckeye we will have to make trips out here just for Federico's."}
{"text":"Piggy-backing off my review from across the street at Salsitas.... Went over to Federico's instead.  Friendly service.  They speak English as well.  Food ordered accurately.  Served too hot to eat right away.  No complaints."}
{"text":"One star for cleanliness and fast service. Taco Bell is way better than this place. I had two ground beef tacos with rice and refried beans for lunch today. It was my first visit here. The taco meat was not seasoned very well- bland. As we're the beans and rice too. It's as if your Italian grandma was making tacos at home for the first time and she didn't know what she was doing! I will stick with Old Pueblo and Señor Taco, thank you very much..."}
{"text":"Not impressed, and it does not take alot to make me twinkle. The burritos are half the size and twice the price.oh and if you complain , they act like Apple. Love it or leave, whats the alternative?..Taco Bell?..

I'll stay away for now, as always keep shopping around and don't settle for less. Vote with your dollar!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Every time I have gone there the wait gets longer and longer. This morning I was the only car in the drive through. They took my card charged it and then didn't tell me anything until I started knocking on the window 20 minutes later. Then after a few more minutes they finally gave me my food. All I had was two breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"First of all, no matter the price of the food I do like quality meat. That tells me a lot about a restaurant's quality. 

We ordered a chicken salad, a beef taco and the beef burrito combo (combo means rice and beans, no drink) 

The chicken salad had a ton of chicken and not a lot of lettuce. The quality of the chicken was great and very flavorful. All in all, good dish. 

The beef on the taco and burrito needed some seasoning. It was kind of bland. The portions of all the dishes were very good. The taco was the size of a Taco Bell taco, but was $2. 

I saw the meats go on the grill raw which made me happy. It wasn't sitting there all day! 

It was $13 for the 3 items so that's not too bad considering the portions. We will try different dishes, but so far it wasn't anything \"out of this world\". It's nice they have a drive thru and it's open 24 hours.

The quality of food is good, beef dishes seem to lack flavor."}
{"text":"They have really great food but I am sick and tired of their rude employees!  They never smile, never say thank you, never say bye on the phone and don't get me started on how they treat you if you ask for flour tortillas over corn or no guacamole, etc!  Only order exactly how they offer it or get ready to be treated like absolute garbage.  The food can be amazing but if their employees are rude, then I am happy to take my business to Caramba's and drive the extra 10 miles.  No matter how nice and apologetic I am when they get irritated at me for making them do a little extra work to make it without their disgusting guacamole or something else, they still can't be nice.  I give up.  The last owner sold it and the new owner finally got the food to taste good but the help is still junk!!!  Hire people that actually care to get a paycheck!  There's plenty of people out there jobless that would love their job!  So start appreciating the customers or you will no longer have a paycheck when the place goes out of business!!!!!!!!  Absolutely ridiculous!"}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give this place no stars.  NASTY, NASTY, NASTY.  I ordered a breakfast burrito with ONLY potatoes, eggs and cheese.  Simple enough right? I got home and opened it up to find half cooked potates, wet eggs, and barely any cheese.  Oh and they added ham to my order along with tomatoes and scallions.  I tried a bite and it was DISGUSTING.  I promptly threw the food in the trash.  Oh, and the price??  RIP OFF.  I can go to almost any \"berto's\" and get the same thing, done correctly,  for just under 4 bucks... they charged me over 5.  I will NEVER eat hear again.  Don't waste your money guys..... Taco Bell has better food. :("}
{"text":"Was looking for another breakfast burrito option that was close to the house and stumbled on this place via Yelp.
Ordered the Chorizo Special and Green Chili Burrito.
Chorizo Special was OK. Would have been better if I liked my papas cooked like the culinary world says they should be cooked. I don't. I like soft papas. I couldn't really tell if the chorizo was spicy or not. Will get a regular chorizo burrito next time. 
The Green Chili Burrito was excellent! Lots of filling and it was good."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say I cant believe this place got so many bad reviews on here other then the first review. Second of all let me say that the only thing i've had here are the burritos and tacos so maybe that is why. 

I have been here about 5 times now so I can comfortable say that the flavor is consistent and the quality is the same every time. My first trip was their opening weekend and my latest trip was last Tuesday. On Tuesdays they have 99 cent tacos and 1.99$ burritos. 

I would say that it is a tie between the Arizona burrito and the Green Chili burrito for top burrito i've ever had....they are amazing...add sour cream to the green chili burrito to really bring it to life. 

I've also had the beef taco, carne asada taco, and pork taco....all were good, but not as good as the burritos. 


I recommend you try this place on a Tuesday and get the Green Chili burrito and judge this place for yourself....if its bad, you are out 1.99$...if it is good you just found a great burrito place like I have. 

Again...im shocked this place has received so many 1-2 stars so far...."}
{"text":"Trying Federico's for the first time on Military Monday (buy a combo get one plus free drink).  Tried the carne asada and pollo asada plates.  The fresh salsas and asada were delish.  As far as fast food Mexican goes this is very good.  Staff are very friendly too!"}
{"text":"In my relentless quest for the perfect Mexican food, I stumbled upon Federico's. First impression, I encounter a locked door with a women inside that glimpses over at me trying to get in and looking the other way while wiping down a table. I guess that was my cue to try the drive-thru. 

A near-indecipherable wave of static noise blew towards my eardrums once I drove through. Keeping it simple, I ordered the two carne asada tacos with beans and rice. Once I got home, the first thing I noticed was the generous portions of the taco. To the contrary, the tacos only had one unheated tortilla each. I already knew this massive filling was not going to be supported properly by one flimsy corn tortilla. This held true, the structural integrity of the taco collapsed beyond despair within one bite attempt. Secondly, the taste was profoundly underwhelming. The beans and rice were also on the same page, lacklustering in the flavor depot and so goes the salsa and carrots. 

I can't help but to think every cylinder of this establishment was off-beat and beyond repair. Though my regular visits to Ramiro's and Poliberto's are consistently memorable, my search goes on for that perfect taco."}
{"text":"My Dearest Federico's,

It's been a while since we last spoke. I'd like to say that I've been busy, and just haven't had the time, but that would be a lie. The truth is, I've wanted to write, but it just hurts too much. I miss you, Federico. I miss everything about you. The rolled tacos with Guacamole and cheese. The Carne Asada burritos. The morning wood. 

I miss waking up, not grouchy, but eager, because I knew I'd see you on my way to work. I still remember the first time I stuck your meat in my mouth. I remember being nervous because I knew nothing about you. I was nervous that you'd see my Goldenly Bronzed complexion, and fail to realize that beneath the incredibly tanned skin, was a white boy who loved nothing more than to be stuffed by a Mexican's chorizo. But you didn't judge -- not once. Nope, you were a total gentleman. Instead of forcing it down my throat, you simply put it in my face, and allowed me to pace myself until I swallowed every inch. And I did. I remember being in my UPS truck, thinking about you every time I checked my mirrors and saw the stain you had left on my shirt from the warm juice that had dripped from my mouth. By noon, I was fully aware of the pounding I had taken, because I didn't shit right for a week. But I didn't care, some bubble guts are a small price to pay for what you were putting inside of me. I had to see you again. 

Before long, I had completely forgotten about Ronald and that red-headed bitch Wendy. Fuck a Frosty, my mouth was fully committed to you, Federico. God we had some good times, didn't we? But, like all great relationships, we, too, faced some adversity. You know what I'm talking about right? The day of the dog, Remember? I felt as if I was slapped in the face that morning. Let me rewind a little bit. 

When the word got out about my new morning routine, my friends and family were against it. They would tell me how bad you are, and you will eventually damage my heart. They even stooped as low as accusing you of putting dog meat into my mouth. FUCKING DOG MEAT! But I wouldn't listen. I was in love and didn't care what anybody had to say. So you can imagine the anger, and sense of betrayal I felt when I pulled up to your drive through, and was LITERALLY greeted by a dog barking in Spanish through the speaker(100% True story). Without skipping a beat, I ordered my Carne Asada. I guess I was so used to pulling up and not understanding a single fucking word anyway, that I just took it in stride. I don't speak Dog or Spanish, so I wasn't even going to ATTEMPT to understand Spanish Dog.  But even that wasn't enough for me to leave you. Maybe my friends were right, maybe you WERE putting your dog meat inside of me. But I wouldn't accept that, so I quickly dismissed that theory, and convinced myself that maybe the dog taking my order was covering the normal woman's shift. What an idiot. But hey, we were young. 

Wow, look at me. It's been years since our last rendezvous, yet, you still cause me to nervously ramble. I guess my love for you followed me to San Jose. Anyways, I just wanted to stop by and say hello. And that I can only hope that you miss my mouth, as much as my mouth misses stuffing you inside of it. I love you, Federicos, you're my favorite Mexican. 

Forever yours, 

Matéo"}
{"text":"Only one car in front of me, still took fifteen minutes in the drive-through. Finally get my meals, drive home to feed family, and my side of beans are missing. (The kids favorite part) Drive all the way back and go inside to ask for the beans, and ask for a couple sides of sour cream since I'm back again anyways and they wanted to charge me a buck and change each one! (I asked for 2) I said the least they could do is comp a few measly sides of sour cream since I wasted all that gas to come back a second time for my missing items that I'd already paid for but they insisted to charge me! Been in the F&B game well over a decade and it's common sense to do a little something nice when you mess up an order. Don't waste your money here on mediocre mexican food and poor customer service! Drive the extra mile to senior tacos or Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"I will never be coming back. I come here all the time and almost every time I get bad customer service and very little food. I paid almost $10 for Carde Asada fries and the container was half-full. I'd recommend Herreras down the street any day over this place. They don't rip you off and they know how to treat their customers. Not to mention your containers keep getting smaller but the prices stay the same?"}
{"text":"Probably the best fast Mexican food in town. I drove 30 minutes just to get my fix. I would highly recommend it. Nothing like the taste of authentic Mexican food for a great price."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place.  It's looks clean and nice on the outside so I thought I might have found a great spot for a good breakfast burrito.  Unfortunately the burrito was not that good and they got one of my orders completely wrong so my wife didn't even get to eat hers."}
{"text":"Ugh. I've never eaten at a Federico's, Rodiberto's, Pinocchio's or any other O's before and this was the last time I'll ever do it. Came back late from Anthem and didn't feel like cooking - this place is brand new, we've eaten at just about every Surprise food establishment and against my better judgement I suggested that we give it a shot for proverbials and giggles. The food was just DISGUSTING. I got a burrito and cheese enchilada combo and had to photograph it halfway through. Here's the pic (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Lhaj-hGoMgw70_vbFW9a9Q?select=nHDw95uHdll5qMAp3RY19A). After bringing the \"meal\" home (we live a mile away) the burrito tortilla was almost completely cold and I'm 100% convinced it was store bought. No doubt about it. Leathery and foul, like eating something directly out of the packet from Frys. After pulling it apart to remove the green peppers I noticed that there was maybe two tablespoons' worth of shredded beef in there, barely enough to fill a taco let alone a burrito. I had three bites of the thing before discarding it and almost retching - the entire experience was like mowing down on a spandex shirt that someone had just worked out in. The enchilada containment space looked like the locker room scene from the movie \"Carrie\" - see photo for proof. Rice was okay. Beans were okay, but pureed to the consistency of mashed potatoes. Barely any flavour at all. The wife's mileage was the same - she flung her carne asshola burrito after a single bite and wound up pouring a bowl of cereal for dinner. I tentatively bit into the kid's cheese quesadilla and almost couldn't strangle it down. We didn't need another Mexican restaurant in Phoenix and certainly not in Surprise. I hope this place goes down the gurgler in short order. A rare single star from me."}
{"text":"Food has great flavor. Issue is manager has been told like 8+ times by myself that prices on board don't match what they ring up. It's usually dollar or two more. Never seems to fix issue. 
I eat Mexican food like 4/5 times a week and avoid this place because of this issue. 

Year later..... menu prices still don't reflect amount they charge. Food has taken turn for the worse. Burnt tortillas on two different burros. Carnitas tacos, barley any meat! 
It was a meat and cheese only. Very Sad!!!!"}
{"text":"For Mexican fast food, this place is legit. So many options and a variety of different dishes from burritos and quesadillas to tortas they have it all. The quality is good. I love their quesadillas and their breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Been several times, love their carnitas. Husband loves their horchata, and he's picky!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and the drive through was fairly fast.  Ordered a bean and cheese burrito with potatoes.  It was just okay.  I didn't even finish it.  The beans were in between mashed refried beans and whole beans so chunky.  The potatoes were slightly undercooked."}
{"text":"Best ARIZONA MEXICAN BURRITO place I have found since I've been here. 

I love the burritos especially the carne Asada or chicken. It's huge and delicious. 

They are open 24 hrs so it's perfect late at night. 


I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This my first time visiting this place and I gotta say the food is great....But the girl up front is extremely rude."}
{"text":"The food was good if your up at 1o'clock in the morning and hungry for Mexican food this is a good place to go. The beans and rice are ok but the mini tacos are pretty good. The staff is really nice and the food is cooked when you order it so not a bunch of old nasty laying around food and it's always consistent. Bottom line great late night meal or drunk food!"}
{"text":"I love the workers especially the drive thru lady at nights. I have gone back a couple of times for their burritos. Friendly staff and great salsa!"}
{"text":"New in town & this place was recommended to my husband and I by many people.  We are both from CA, so we know good Mexican food.  We have been living in Italy for the past few years, where Mexican food is non-existent, so we were looking forward to eating here.  I got the 1 taco & 1 enchilada plate & my husband got the 1 burrito & 1 enchilada plate.  While eating the beans I was thinking to myself how salty they were, & then moved on to the taco which was even more salty. It tasted like I was eating pure salt. I mentioned it to my husband, & he said the same thing.  Needless to say, we did not finish our food. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"As a native of San Diego where there is a good Mexican food restaurant on just about every block, I must say this is my go to place while living here in Scottsdale. I have had the Carnitas burrito and is my absolute favorite. The Arizona burrito is similar to the California burritos in San Diego. The difference is instead of potatos, pico and guac, you add sour cream, cheese with fries. The menudo is excellent and my wife's favorite. I can go on about other menu items. If you're looking for good fast mexican food than look no further."}
{"text":"Tonight is the 3rd time I have gone there about 15 mins. before posted closing time and the neon light says \"Open\", but when they see you drive up, the staff literally turns off all the lights inside on you when you drive up and refuses to serve you. I can see them inside with the light in the cooking area still on but by the time you get to the outside order speaker they won't answer and wait for you to leave. As you finally figure out their not going to take your order and pull forward you can see all the lights have been turned completely off now.  I took pictures this time which brought the one older Hispanic lady out from inside to see what I was doing. I told her this was just one too many times they had done this to me.  She recognized me too because I have been a regular customer over the years until now.  I like an only a few things on the menu anyway. I love enchiladas but their cheese can't be real it just becomes glue and the enchilada sauce tastes like vinegar; I can't eat it, the chicken I won't eat it at all and I love chicken. For some reason, the order takers never get my drink order in the drive-thru which is irritating and I leave without a drink. I would still eat there for some things, but tonight ripped it......you lost me as a customer along with the other two cars that were behind me that had the same experience no doubt. I saw the one driver shake his head in disbelief as he pulled away from the drive-thru that a place of business would behave this way. Federico has a lot of these little Mexican food shops around the Phoenix area, so I guess he doesn't need our business because I sent an email to the company address about what happened and no response."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. We used the drive thru. First,  the pricing on their menu board is higher than their website. Someone needs to update that. The employees were nice enough,  but i would say the long dark haired gal that came to the window might want to try a little harder to be nice. Her attitude was simply bland and borderline rude. Sad that these days quality service is hard to find. 

There was hair in my friends combo. They all need to be conscious of that, especially since it was CLEARLY sticking out of the white foam box. Couldn't miss it. 

The food... not very good. I love mexican food. For $10 i would expect so much more. First off way too salty. I ordered the pollo asado and the chicken was dry and over cooked. So disappointed.  All in all I doubt i will return."}
{"text":"Make sure they cook it! 
Shoot at least make sure they microwave it long enough. 
Ordered a Carne Asada Burrito that was obviously heated up in the microwave. It was still cold and the vegetables still frozen and huge uncut frozen tomatoes made it even worse. 
Will never eat at any of these locations again."}
{"text":"This placed used to be good but in the last year has become complete garbage. Food is cold, they overcook the tortilla EVERY TIME, they get the order wrong multiple times, and they are extremely rude. Any other Mexican food restaurant in the area would get my business before ever returning here."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, especially burritos!!!! I usually get California Burrito. This place is one of the best Mexican food in Scottsdale.  This is the second time I came. The first time customer service was excellent. The last time I came (02/12/17 after 9pm) service was horrible."}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed in the food, I ordered a fish taco and it had no flavor and the carne asada burrito was the same. I gave them 1 star because they are very polite."}
{"text":"We ordered two pork chili burritos and got one and one pork chili Relleno burrito. I took the wrong one back and the lady at the counter and she refused to exchanged it for me and argued with me saying I was wrong and was very rude. I was here on Sunday before Labor Day 2017 at 3:00pm. Someone needs to teach her people and customer skills because we left very unhappy, and I go there all the time and might not again. What ever happen to customers always right? That would be a good Moro."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance after going thru the drive thru the first time and ordering 2 carne asada burritos and two pepsis, they repeated my order wrong, I corrected them, they apologized. Got to the window. Still gave me the wrong order, when I told them the young man argued with me about what I ordered. It was a turn off but this morning I really wanted a breakfast burrito so I drove up ordered 1 breakfast burrito which is supposed to be bacon, egg and cheese. Got to the window the older man said one ham burrito? I told him no a breakfast burrito with bacon, he smiled and said ok. Got home.....ham burrito. Both times they were not busy, I was the only person in the drive thru. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food place near where I live! So happy to have found it I was going to \"salsitas\" on van buren and 24th street but this place is way way better! Plus they haven't messed up my order yet and the food is fresh and yummy"}
{"text":"I love the \"Rico/Berto\" brands of taco stands in town so much that I've made it a point to try a new one every time I find out about them. This newest one opened and I was not impressed; in fact the beans were kinda bad. I went again recently and there has been a marked improvement. I'm sure the owners are working hard to make it better."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on My brake and I was disappointed with the food. I order some carne asada fries and the meat on it was cold and without seasoning also I ask for extra salsa and the cashier lady told Me it was extra charge. I think I had paid enough money for My food to be charged extra for simple salsa."}
{"text":"Disappointed, was really craving a mexican burrito. I ordered a Pollo Asado burrito and what I got was still raw. The chicken was still pink in the middle! I really don't plan on returning ever."}
{"text":"I ordered over $44 in food from the drive thru. I brought the food home and found they messed up my order. They didn't include all the ingredients of my meal. I called the restaurant and told them of the mistake and they said,\"Give me your name and the next time you come in we will give you the missing ingredients.\"

So if they forget the lettuce on your taco, you get only lettuce in return. The lady fought with us and said that it's only guacamole so you can still eat it. But if you pay over $11 for a plate, I would expect all the ingredients.

The lady hung up and will not answer the phone anymore. Phone is off the hook."}
{"text":"I personally prefer Filiberto's but they have been raising their prices so much this past year that I decided to try Federico's which is only two miles from my home !

Federico's at this location is the best.  They have select combo meals for $5 and that includes a free beverage !  Are you kidding me ?

Tacos with your choice of ground beef, shredded beef and chicken for .99 cents ! Everyday !

Bean and cheese burritos are only $1.49 !

My favorite combo meal is the taco, tostada, rice and beans with a free drink for only $5 plus tax.  This meal alone can feed two people.  However, since I am fat I choose to eat it all myself baby.  LOL.

Please Note:  Not all Federico's are the same.  Not all locations are fast, clean and affordable like this location.  They certainly are not priced the same.  There is one near my job and the same combo meal costs over six dollars and that does not include a free beverage.  No Bueno !

The taste and quality is just a notch below Filiberto's ( Filiberto's is the best ) but as long as this Federico's at this location keeps these awesome prices then this is my choice for fast food mexican food."}
{"text":"This is the place you want to go after a night of drinking. The food is typical Mexican food. The drive thru was quick and efficient. The major issue i had with this location is that the portion size on my Carne Asada fries was ridiculously small. Every other location i've been to usually gives you a good chunk of everything, but this location really got  stingy. That was a major disappointment. Ill revisit again in a couple of weeks and ill see if i have the same experience."}
{"text":"In the area today and decided to give this location a try as we always go to the one on 43rd Ave & Peoria. Some positives at this location were free refills on sodas, they offer kids meal and the hot sauce has a little more kick to it. All of the above which do not exist at the other location.

Our food was hot and fresh and my son and I are going to try the Shrimp burrito next time. This place is worth a try if your in the area and simply want some quick decent Mexican food."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THE DRIVE THRU! Each car takes about 7-10 minutes, and god fobid there be 2 cars in front of you on lunch break.

I had their $0.99 taco on tuesday, and only a small pinch of shredded beef. And they are a bit stale. And their regular $2.09 tacos are the exact same.

Happy for Mexican food here in Laveen, but wondering when Filiberto's will be here."}
{"text":"Been going here for a so often because its the closest mexican food to my house. But after my last visit i wont go any long. 

Aside from the multiple orders messed up. Putting fresh, but still with hot oil on them, chips in styrofoam containers.

 The first time i took my girl friend there she was throwing up a few hours after eating. She hadn't eaten anything else. 

I would not advise eating here, the price doesnt match the food quality either."}
{"text":"Their El Rey burrito is so good! Carne asada, ham, bacon and guacamole is a perfect combination I would never have thought of. The chimichanga is pretty decent too. The service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Holy Frijoles! 
This is one damn good place to get a burrito. Bringing home a bean and cheese burrito from Frederico's is like bringing home a delicious, oozing, salsa-fying, two pound, mouth watering bundle of joy! Except you don't have to bail it out of jail for stealing that cop car on spring break or pay for it's college education. The deal here is that it costs less than $3!

This is my new addiction. I seriously can't get enough and that could be dangerous, but I'm not sure more for whom or for what; my wallet, my waistline or for the people in the surrounding vicinity of my backside. :-)"}
{"text":"This food is delicious. I had the carnitas and they were amazing. They hooked us up with peppers salsa lemons and utensils without asking. I definitely would go back again!"}
{"text":"Umder new management. I use to go to this federicos twice a week. Good food, big burritos and great service. NOW all new employees and management. Small burritos and small portions and they have raised all prices!! Stay away. A rip off!"}
{"text":"The staff are all very frindly. Place is very clean inside and out. The food is good with lots of flavor. I know it's fast food but it is a lot better then Taco Bell and I think it's even better then Filibertos. If your unsure what something is they will explain it to you. They are open 24 hrs but the best thing I like about them is they care about their employees. They are closed on Thanksgiving and Christmas like they should be. I respect that very much."}
{"text":"If you include all factors, this is 4 stars. The food tastes good, is affordable, and made to order. I am glad I came across this place. You can't compare it to \"fancy\"Mexican places, but the cheap places it blows out of the water for sure!"}
{"text":"Really was not impressed i ordered 2 tacos with no lettuce and extra cheese. When I got home both the tacos had lettuce on them and not much cheese. The meat was pretty good not the best but it should have a more. But it was taco tuesday and they were cheep so maybe theres more on the full priced tacos. My wife got the Arizona burrito and said it was very good and had lots of meat."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Wednesday. Not packed which was nice. I received great service! Food was fresh and hot with fast delivery. Awesome crunchy tacos and rolled tacos.  Everything was clean: tables, service counter, salsa bar, drink statiob, floors, etc. This is a new location. I'll come back again for sure!! Also, great specials! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Ok food. Cashier with an attitude. Cashier was short with us and stopped and had an entire conversation in Spanish before giving us our change. Then we asked for our cup for our drink and she said we didnt order one. We had to show our receipt. We were the only people there. Then when our order was up she called our number...again forced us to show receipt even though no one else was there. Very rude lady. Salsa bar was weak. Rolled tacos were good. We will not go back to a place that makes us feel unwelcome."}
{"text":"When they first opened their burritos were impressively size-able.  We ordered again the other day the same breakfast burrito and was disappointed on the shrinkage. Portions need to be consistent. Never know what I'll be getting next. Food portions needs consistency"}
{"text":"I won't be back here.

Most cheap drive through fast food Mexican places are alike. Of course there are slight differences. In this case it wasn't for the better.

We had to drive up to the window to order. The speaker box wasn't working? What was going on there?

I ordered a chicken chimichanga with sour cream & guacamole on the side. The chimi was big, just like I expected it to be. There wasn't much guacamole. I would have liked more. They also put tomatoes in it. That's ok, I'm just mentioning it. All in all this chimi just didn't sit as well as others I've had. Maybe it was the spices they used that were different, I'm not sure.

I also ordered a large horchata. I have definitely had better. It wasn't the worst I've ever had but it needed more cinnamon flavor, that's for sure.

It's cheap, it's easy, it's fast, it's literally right down the street from me. I'd still rather make the drive over to 7th St to my fave 'bertos though. See: http://www.yelp.com/biz/rolbertos-phoenix"}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed first time around, thought I'd give it a second chance. I'm writing this review from my toilet, I know not too classy, oh well, trying to get the message across. I ate dinner there just about an hour ago, five minutes ago I was doubled over with the worst stomach cramps that I can remember. The food was subpar, oily, low quality Mexican, yuck. I will never go back! Eat there at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious food and very reasonable prices and portions. What else can you ask for?  Maybe a salsa bar with multiple choices of salsas, they have one...  maybe you love hot carrots and jalapeños...  they have the best.  Just found out they also roll their rolled tacos by hand in the store. That explains why they are so good. 
Doesn't matter if you are starving or looking for a late night snack, they have what you want and it hits the spot.   Their green Chile is great!  Pollo asada, delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered a chorizo and egg burrito, it was a huge, sloppy, off-putting, pile of mess. The Chorizo was \"chewy\" for some strange reason, and it didn't have that familiar somewhat spicy chorizo kick to it. The burrito tasted bland and thrown together. Worse than the awful burrito was the horrible customer service of the employee...he basically threw my food out the window at me, and he replied to me with an aggravated sounding \"What?\" twice when  I asked him questions... I threw the disgusting burrito in the trash where it belonged, and I'll never, ever go back there again!"}
{"text":"I've recently started patronizing Federico's over the last year since my go to Mexican restaurant gets too crazy busy during lunch. The employees are friendly and the place always rocks the A/C.

My favorite is definitely the Carnitas Burrito. Just bathe it in your favorite salsa from the salsa bar and you'll be very happy and full. This Burrito is packed with a ton of meat that would make the Chipotles of the word blush with envy. Another favorite is the Super Nachos with your choice of meat. This guy can be shared between 2-3 people. They allow you to switch of ingredients. For example, I replace the sour cream with Guacamole. I also love with Torta special. My only complaint is that the bread is too much of a butter taste. Otherwise a solid choice. Their Leche is excellent. My only regret is that I haven't had the Menudo yet. Next weekend, I promise."}
{"text":"Idk what has happened to this restaurant but the prices have become ridiculous and the food not as good. $14 for a bean and cheese burrito + ham/cheese/egg/potato burrito is absurd. I think this may be my last time this place..."}
{"text":"We eat her ALOT and normally it's pretty good but as of recent, they have been messing up orders and serving cold/burnt food. I don't like to give these type of reviews but I am really surprised at how they have changed. Hopefully they will turn it around."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  It's extremely close to my new house and I love a good Mexican place that has a drive through for those nights when you want good food but don't feel like going in.

Unfortunately it just didn't live up to my hopes.  The chicken tacos were decent but the enchilada sauce, rice and beans had NO flavor!  Very bland.  And to top it off the cheese enchilada was so cold, the shredded cheese inside the enchilada wasn't even melted.  

So disappointing!  I am a señor taco regular but the closest location doesn't have a drive through.  Not the most ideal situation when I'm hauling around my 3 kids but I'll choose it over eating here again."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I went here for the first time... as I am from San Diego where the Mexican food game is on point.  The first time I ate here I ordered enchiladas with red sauce.  They were pretty typical of a chain restaurant.  Not bad, not awesome, but good and I would order them again. 

The next time I came I ordered bean and cheese burritos for the whole family (that's 6 total).  They were quick, hot and the ratio of bean to cheese was perfect.

Next time I tried a green chile burrito.  This one in particular is DELICIOUS!  If you are not a fan of heat, it may not be the choice for you.  However, if you do like a little kick in your meal, try it out.  You won't be disappointed.

My boyfriend always gets the Arizona burrito. I haven't personally tried this one yet, but it looks amazing and he always raves about it.  He adds sour cream when ordered.  This is my next must try.

Definitely worth a stop, great option for this area for sure."}
{"text":"This place is really good, love their burritos and quesadilla! The only thing I dislike is they can mess up the orders sometimes and drive thru can take 30 mins. Its ridiculous but worth the wait I guess. Lol Other than that. Food is fresh"}
{"text":"The food is sub par,  at best.  The only thing good is that  they have a food return policy."}
{"text":"Food is decent and customer service needs a lot of work..I'll never come here again due to the fact that I got a bad case of food poisoning from this place.

At 1pm on 3/16/18 I ordered 2 Carne Asada Fries for food for the road and got food poisoning throughout the rest of my camping trip over the weekend. Never Again."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now.  Twice for dinner and once for breakfast.  

First, I love their shredded beef tacos.  They are addicting. 

The kids like their cheese quesadillas.  They use a full size tortilla and aren't stingy with the cheese.  

Their carne asada was so-so.  

The cheese enchilada was pretty bad. This was due to the weird sauce.  It certainly didn't taste like any enchilada sauce I've ever had.

I had the bacon breakfast burrito once.  When I pulled up and saw the price, roughly $4.75 after tax, I thought  \"oh boy, this is gonna be one of those places that throws a 5 lb. bomb at you\".  Unfortunately, no.  For nearly $5 I got a small, hopeless burrito.  

This is my biggest problem with Federico's....they are over priced.  I can get a larger burrito at similar restaurants for at least a dollar less.  It's not just the breakfast burrito, but everything on the menu.  I'm all for smaller portions, but at least make your prices match.  

Will I be back?  Oh yes!  As I said, the tacos are addicting.  But I'll probably just stick with that."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and enjoyed a Carne asada burrito, just under $6.  Tasty and I noticed there was a fresh cilantro taste, much more so tht the standard f...berto's places.  Meat was a bit tougher than others but also there were fesh onions and spices too. I'd go again and they are amazingly fast at getting my order out"}
{"text":"It's alright, can't really complain when they are open at 4:00am! It's this or AM/PM selected breakfast!!! YUM!!! Federico's is just another fast food joint that offers you some nice grease filled food. If I didn't like it, I would stop going to them. So you're safe until someone else decides to be open at 4am?"}
{"text":"Wanted to have a breakfast burrito before work, drove up and only had one car in front of me! No big deal, right? After sitting there for 15 minutes, I had to go! Was going to be late for work. Should have gotten out of the truck, and gone inside! But you would think the drive through would have been quicker?"}
{"text":"I can only comment about the \"Hard Chicken Tacos\" since that is all that I have tried. But I have had them 4 times, and all 4 times they were great.

It's not easy to find \"good hard tacos\" in Phoenix.  Fast food chicken tacos are ALL crappy.  Some or most of the \"Mexican\" food restaurants try to fry their own corn tortillas and fold them into taco shells ( /Fail ) or just sell \"rolled tacos.\"

These at Federicos are good taco shells which don't fall apart from the first bite, and don't get \"soggy on the bottom\" too soon.

The meat has a very good flavor - not too salty and not too spicy, but definitely not drab or bland.

Price is good too.  They run a special where you can get 5 tacos and a drink for like $5.29 or something.  It's crazy cheap, and the portions are not small.

It's my \"go-to spot\" for hard tacos."}
{"text":"I really like this place despite the location.. at first, I was scared to give it a try. But it's been great every time. I ordered a chorizo special burrito & it was steaming HOT and delicious. I don't understand why there is a .50 cent charge to use a debit/credit card.. but other than that it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive-thru. No response on the speaker. Knocked on the window numerous times.... No response. Finally knocked hard enough (I guess) and the guy waved me off stating they're closed. THEY ARE 24HOURS!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever. You're better off at Taco Bell. Ordered a combo and each item was in a separate box (rice, beans, etc) instead of together like it should be. Food is bland and flavorless. Filiberto's is superior, so that's saying s lot. I've come twice hoping it will improve, but it just gets worse. I won't return."}
{"text":"The place was filthy, service was terrible and average food was over priced.  I wont return."}
{"text":"I saw my review from a while back and thought to add a few NEW positive thoughts to be fair!  We've eaten here many times since.  This is a very clean \"Bertos\" restaraunt!  The food is ok, others would say very good...I like some other places better! The service is good now.  Its close to home and I have no complaints.  This place has definitiely improved over time... well done Federicos!"}
{"text":"I noticed they had salads on the menu, so I asked if they could make me a side salad with no meat or seafood. The girl at the window said she'd have to charge me full price- $9.49! Take note, the menu's pricing reflected $7.49 and 8.49 for the chicken and shrimp salads. I mentioned this and she said, well, that's the new price. Since I didn't want her pocketing the difference, rather than order something else, I backed up and left. Bunch of crooks and paying almost $10 for a side salad with just lettuce, tomato and avocado is ridiculous. Will never visit again. It's so hard finding vegetarian friendly restaurants on the west side. Makes it almost impossible to eat out with the meat eating family members."}
{"text":"Went here a couple nights ago, got two enchiladas with rice and beans and chips and salsa. I have no idea if it was the nasty onions in the enchiladas, the ranchero sauce on the enchiladas, or the chips salsa that was very, very old, but I got extremely violent... Well food poisoning. I'll spare you the details, but there was blood involved. I only say that so you know how bad it was. Left me completely debilitated for two days straight. I never have trouble with even sketchy food, but this place completely wrecked me. For what it's worth, my two friends had no problems health wise,but did not enjoy their food.

I don't mean to slander the place, but I felt the need to at least report it for others to be aware. After googling them, I see they've had problems with this in the past. Beware."}
{"text":"... I would post a photo of my breakfast burrito.. But I ate it too fast.. But, it was HUUUUUGE! And delicious!! And served all day.. Whaaaat???? Yummy! The fact that they have a drive-thru makes this place tops over your so called Mexican food (Taco Bell).. this is authentic Mexican food at fast food prices and convenience!"}
{"text":"Typical Mexican fast-food fare at a reasonable price, Federico's hits the spot at any time of the day. Open 24 hours, they are there to satisfy your cravings, whether you are looking for a burrito plate, tacos, quesadillas, tortas, or even soup!

On my last visit I decided to try something different and went with their new \"El Rey Burrito\" - a hefty, fresh flour tortilla packed with carne asada, ham, bacon, guacamole and pico. Yes - there is a lot going there. Actually a little too much. As much as I wanted to enjoy this burrito, I had a hard time getting through it - the salty, yet varied flavors of the three principal ingredients seemingly battling my palate for attention. I lost. Alas, it was more than I wanted. I know that it's not \"traditional\" (but then again neither is bacon and ham in anything other than a breakfast burrito) but I think I would have enjoyed it more had the filling been blended with the contrasting, more neutral flavors of lettuce, cheese and (dare I say) sour cream. Actually, I think I would have enjoyed a regular carne asada burrito. Yeah, that's probably what I'll do next time.

Because there definitely will be a next time....

Nice fresh salsa bar, but they do charge for chips."}
{"text":"I'm being nice by giving them 1 star!  We used to go there all the time. However, last time I went I found a cardboard staple in my food. When I took it to them the manager stated that it wasn't from them that they run a very sanitary and clean operation.  I'm not going to put a staple in my.own food!!! WTF! Then she stated they don't have anything cardboard in the building to which I pointed out the boxes in the back.  I'll never go back there again!  She even asked me what I wanted her to do about it...uh fix it!!  What if I had swallowed this monstrosity! Don't go here!  Several of my friends have gotten food poisoning from them.  Health department needs to pay them another visit."}
{"text":"Horchata is really good so far. Waiting on the food!
It took a little too long, but I guess it's not FAST food, so I was ok with that.  The food was ok, and the place was NICE and CLEAN. which is unusual for small dive-y places."}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars, I would. F*** this place. We ordered a super nachos, the large size. They gave us the small size, but the meat was ICE COLD. When we went back up to the register to ask for a new one, in their exact words, they said \"We can't give you a new one and we always serve the meat cold\". YIKES. I've been to this particular location before and can confirm that that is a big lie, the meat is usually hot. This Federico's SUCKS and I will never come back."}
{"text":"Great food.  Spicy when you want it to be and it always hits the spot when you need a late night snack.  Drive-Thru is awesome and convenient....just talking about it makes me want to get out of bed and go get some right now!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fast and authentic.  Great for late night as it hits the spot when I'm craving good Mexican food.  I'll definitely be back as my mouth is watering as I type this....I'm hungry now :). I may just head that way now."}
{"text":"Not good.  I've ordered food twice recently at this location, at the drive through window, late at night on the weekend.  The first time I ordered the Super Nachos.  Meh.  It wasn't very good, and for $10, I expected good.  Tonight I revisited, and ordered a carne asada burrito, and a couple of pollo tacos.  The burrito was not good at all.  I tried to choke it down, but couldn't finish it.  Not much taste, and not very good.  The tacos were dry, and over cooked.  Couldn't finish them, either. Waste of money.  I really wanted to like this place, because it's in the neighborhood, and so convenient.  I've no idea why this place has relatively high reviews on Yelp.  Perhaps the food served on different days and different times, is better?"}
{"text":"I just want to know how is this place still in business with all the other competition. This place is just not horrible food but to me unsafe ."}
{"text":"Kind of average 

I visited Federicos based on all of the positive yelp reviews. The service was very good however, I thought the food was just okay.

On this visit we had the Carne Asada Burrito and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole.  The burrito was full of meat and was flavorful, but it just wasn't anything special. The tree rolled taco, once again were good but nothing special. 

I will revisit soon and try other menu items, but this visit was just kind of average."}
{"text":"Food is good if you get everything you order or if it's done correctly. Too often we pay for items we don't get thru the take out window."}
{"text":"Hold on...wait a minute: Is that a 24 HOUR DRIVE THRU I see?! *Thinking* Oh yeah, definitely gonna try this place. I know, a Drive Thru BIG DEAL your thinking right? Well, in SF Drive Thru's are RARE. Very RARE. Unless your going to eat a Mc Donalds, Jack in the BOX..A Mexican Drive Thu SON OF A BEE STING! ok you get it. 

It was late and I was in \"party mode\". I would not expect authentic Mexican food from this place. At this point I didn't care what the food tasted like, I wanted some. Did I mention they are open 24 hours a day! 

I ordered:

A beef chimichanga plate and it was huge!! It was covered with cheese, sour cream and guac! It was fresh and tasty! Nice and Greasy.....yum! Rice and Beans. Not a fan of the rice..whatever though. The chimichanga was good! 

5 Chicken Rolled Taquitos (yes, my eyes are bigger than my belly)...They were nice and crunchy not soggy at all. 

The Horchata was refreshing a simply delicioso! 

Definitely a place I will go back to when in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Totally wouldn't think to go here if you drove past. But the food is amazing and the folks are very nice. Great Mexican fair and even has a good selection with seafood. I recommend the shrimp and steak quesadilla. They also have a good selection of deserts and drinks.

I should have posted this review months ago, but was properly motivated today, when Edward B, the bad review below me, had a complete childish meltdown in the store. He cursed at the staff and threw his full drink at the wall, which exploded everywhere. All because his order had Guac and sour cream on it.... zero class... good example set for your kids. The staff handled the situation well.

Please visit this place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh, wow I had no idea it was under new management. It was awful then and much worse now. I asked for a simple bean burrito, it tastes like grease from a tire shop. The menudo was horrendous like they used toilet water. The meat was filthy and they covered all that with red chili. (Gagging)"}
{"text":"To start I LOVE Federico's....But NOT this location.  I typically get the AZ Burro at Federico's and it's always BOMB at the Litchfield Park, and Maryvale locations.  When I got it here, I swear that was not carne asada but GATO!   YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Last night while i was drunk as heck coming back from a party, my friends and I collectively decided that we were extremely hungry. It was 2 in the morning and not a whole lot of choices came to mind. That is is until my friend suggested the 24 hours federicos. 

There was a drive through and the service was fast and simple. I got the carne asada buritto with sour cream and pico, with a little quacamole. It was made quicky and i have to tell you that each and every bite i took of that mama jama was equal to heaven. 

The buritto was huge. And freakin heavy. Every bite was filled with carne and sour cream. It was funny because my friend was like \"take a few bites and we will eat the rest when we get home\" , but i couldnt stop. I devoured the entire beast within minutes and I was satisfied."}
{"text":"I will not be returning to Federico's.

I've been ordering burritos from Federico's for some time now. I usually just go bean and cheese with some rice, guac and pico. Simple. Tasty.

Today I opted for the drive thru for the first time, and I took a moment to decide whether I wanted to switch it up with some chicken. I made my choice to add it to my burrito and proceeded to the window to pay for it, even giving a bigger than usual holiday tip. This was gonna be GREAT.

What happened next was heartbreaking and left me in shock and awe. On my way home, I steal a bite of my burrito and it's all chicken. None of my other burrito adornments are in sight as I peer through this salty mess of chicken. I give it a squeeze and all I feel is lumpy chicken for miles. Da hell? I decided to wait until I got home to investigate further.

My burrito was assembled as if it had purposefully been intended to be the worst burrito ever. 2/3 of one end was chicken and the last third was cheese, beans, a few grains of rice, pico, and maybe a DROP OR TWO OF GUAC. In that order, as if perfectly arranged one on top of the other to ensure minimal mixing of ingredients and a mouth full of unmelted cheese. I'm serious. I know it sounds crazy, but I don't joke about burritos.

I think it's reasonable to expect that anyone working at a mexican food establishment would be familiar with proper burrito assembly. Anyone who has even eaten a burrito could have done a better job assembling my burrito so as to properly disperse it's contents. With their eyes closed.

This, in my opinion, is inexcusable and honestly felt like a deliberate \"F*** YOU.\" This is not a risk I am willing to take again. I'll be sticking with Rolando's on 35th and Peoria."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday ~ enough said!!
Nice people working at this location, good food & always fresh! A line is always present in the drive thru and you never you know who you'll run into inside the restaurant.
Clean place to have a bite OR go for take out! Its nice always being thanked for your business!"}
{"text":"Can you please open one in North San Antonio Texas. My life is incomplete without bean & cheese burritos from you guys"}
{"text":"Our family had been frequenting this establishmentfor a couple of months. However today's visit left MUCH to be desired. I went to the drive-through and ordered something off of the menu. After ordering,  the outdoor microphone was silent for several minutes so I went ahead and pulled up to the window. They processed my payment and gave me my food as I was pulling away from the window I realized there was something wrapped on the top of my box... I looked and it was tortillas. The normal meal that I get there doesn't have wrapped tortillas so I popped the box open to see what it was. It was not what I had ordered. I pulled around and parked my vehicle, I walked inside and told the lady at the counter that my order was incorrect. She stared at me for several seconds with a dirty look on her face, turned around and said to the other lady in Spanish to the other that I had said my order was incorrect. The second lady looked at me and didn't say anything at all she just stared at me with a very disgusted look on her face. After about 25-30 seconds of eye contact with me she said \"you said you wanted #17 the pork\". I explained that I had ordered a number seven off of their menu, but it would not have been pork as I haven't been eating pork. Going back to the part where the mic at the drive-through was totally silent after my order, she tried to state to me that she had confirmed my order with me. That did not happen. Of course it is common that orders get mixed up, and it is no problem, you take them back and change them out for what you actually ordered. However these two women were so rude, and the looks that they gave me, were completely unacceptable. The way they spoke to me was not professional. As if they hadn't already handled it very poorly, then they turn around and begin speaking Spanish to one another, (as if we don't understand them), and the cook behind the counter starts joking about \"adding a little extra\", to which they all began laughing. She turned around, made eye contact with me, and laughed to my face while I was still waiting for the food to be finished, and laughed all the way, as I walked out the door. Food went in the trash and we won't be returning. Our whole family were regulars, especially through the drive through, but we are done. There is a GREAT selection of real  and tasteful Mexican food in the valley, so we will just frequent those instead."}
{"text":"Blandest Mexican food I've ever eaten. Phoenix has plenty of good Mexican food...I don't know why anyone would waste their money here. Even their hot sauce was flavorless. Taco Bell is a better bet for late night. Want good Mexican? Try Tortas Los Reyes, Carolina's, or Most Wanted...not this place."}
{"text":"Can't believe we have lived in this neighborhood for a year and have never stopped by this place before. Best breakfast burritos ever! I got the country and added steak to it. Deliciousness"}
{"text":"went in after a long time, asked for a pollo asado burrito which was really good before. gave it to me cold. it's not the first time i've had bad service at this place. too ghetto and think they're too good. down the street but i won't return."}
{"text":"Great for what it is. Had the 4 taco minor corn tortilla taco combo. Delicious. Love the condiments. Cucumbers. Radishes. In addition to the regular jalapeño carrot. Love it"}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week and really enjoyed it!  Went thru the drive-through and had to wait 5 minutes for our order of shredded beef tostada and same meat taco.  Food came hot and wonderful looking.  IT was fresh and very tasty all for $10 for two people which included a drink for each.  Haven't been inside but want to try it sometime and their famous breakfast burrito.  We hear the carne asada is what you should order with everything although our shredded beef was fantastic, very tasty and plentiful.   Would recommend this place and will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Did not like this place  and it is over priced. Sorry to say, keep it moving else where. I had the fajitas, waste of money"}
{"text":"ordered:
- fish tacos, shredded chicken quesadilla and a pineapple HARRRRRITOS [just watched the lego batman movie okay]

pros:
- quick service
- they sell random sweets at the register
- large portions

cons:
- wish it would be open a little later"}
{"text":"Very pricy for the quality of food. I was not impressed with the food. The people are nice and the lobby was clean. I just wouldn't recommend the food I had to the price. The $7.59 fajitas burrito I was not impressed with. I'd rather eat somewhere else or even chipotle because you get more food for the price."}
{"text":"Just moved here from LA and haven't had any amazing Mexican food since I moved to Phoenix... However this place is amazing and the food is always so bomb! Happy there are so many of these around, I always go here for some fast and delicious Mexican food"}
{"text":"Fast...food...fast!

I am sorry that others have had slow/bad service. Maybe that was then, but now, they are pretty fast.

Typically, I order for two or three folks in my orders and rarely have they been wrong and never have they been slow.

I've had their ceviche and guacamole fries (special order-no salt) several times and was very happy with speed, amount of fries & guacamole and spice-level of the guacamole. My son has had the carne asada fries, also no salt. As well, those orders were excellent, fresh and fast.  And is say that I've eaten here maybe 15 times now...usually forget to check in, but always  am pleased. That's why I continue to come...and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Don't serve nachos or Tamales? What these are the staple food of The Mexican Dishes...I'll go back to Las Favs in Tempe.The BEST."}
{"text":"Food has really gone downhill since it opened. Hardly any meat in enchiladas now    Same with bean burros"}
{"text":"Okay, so I have had some good Hispanic food in my lifetime, and Federicos is on one of the list of the good restaurants.

PROS- I love the atmosphere this restaurant generates. The first time I was here, I had the \"Arizona\" Burrito. It was basically seasoned bits of steak and slices of potatoes. The size of the burrito is outstanding, and definitely tops the size Chipotle throws out. The taste was outstanding. I love their neat little salad bar they have, with four choices of salsa, and some vegetables!

  Another thing is... I absolutely LOVE the horchata they make. It is the best I have had at a Mexican restaurant. The creamy taste of the rice milk, and that cinnamon aftertaste is wondrous. I also recommend the Adobada burrito.

CONS- The location is absolutely horrendous. By that I mean they are literally the only building in a whole suite. You can't attract customers that way, even with the amount of gimmics they throw out. Another thing is, the two televisions showing the futbol (soccer) games is entirely in Spanish. The price, is an entirely different story. Three People get out for 35 Lastly, I would recommend putting more meat, and less onions...

Overall, a nice place to go to if you like good Mexican food in a short while. I would recommend to anybody who does not have heartburn problems, or simply does not like Mexican food."}
{"text":"These guys and gals are great! Genuwine customer service and great food! I came here during a pretty busy lunch rush on a monday, and I have to give credit were credit is due... This place is great to swing in grab a quick bite to eat whether your dining in or ordering togo. 

I ordering the carne asada meal, which comes with two carne asada burritos, Mexican rice, and beans. It was very delicious and prepared very well. I was unable to finish the whole things so I got the rest Togo. 

This place also has drive true is you're not looking to park and walk in! Very convenient!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and hot. Customer service was pretty good. Drive thru line went very quickly. Loved my grilled chicken torta."}
{"text":"Federico's may look like David, but their food is more like the size of Goliath!

They produce some absolutely mouth-watering, authentic Mexican food that will fill your tummy to the brim without emptying your pockets.  Per the picture that I posted, they have $1.99 burritos and .99-cent tacos on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

The burritos are enough to fill you for an entire meal.  So, if you are operating on a budget, you can spend $12 here and have enough to eat for three full days.  Or, on another note, if you need to feed six people for $12, that can be accomplished as well.

The burritos come with your choice of beans & cheese, red chicken (i.e. chicken in red salsa), green chili pork, or shredded beef.  The tacos can include all those and ground beef, but not the green chili pork.  I don't eat pork, but I can say that the red chicken and shredded beef burritos are off the hook in taste and are about 6 inches long and 3 inches wide.  So, move over Subway, there is a new 6-inch delight in town!  The carne asada and fajita burritos are also good.

The service is also cordial and quick.  Along with only a 2-5 minute wait, the girl at the cashier gives great recommendations.  They also have a drive-thru and some outdoor seating.

So, next time you pass this place on Camelback, make a u-turn and get yourself some of the best Mexican food in the area!"}
{"text":"Worst tacos I've ever had. Tripas were dry. Carnitas were dry. The totillas weren't even warmed up. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"For fast food and drive thru, best carne Asada tacos I have had since I have moved from CA to AZ 2 years ago. A bit pricier than most but I think that's the point!"}
{"text":"The food is bomb.and sabroso the best one is this location . I've tried other ones . They hook it up & have specials on Mon Tues & Wed. Defiantly & always will be my place other than mi casa .U got this I give you guys a five star or rating !!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Average so a 3 however the attitude is a 1. We ordered the Chicken quesadilla and was charged 1$ more than posted. She said she couldn't do anything and didn't credit the difference. Based on that they get a 2."}
{"text":"I am the only one in my family that like the \"Bertos\".  They are my first choice when eating alone.  This is by far the best in the city.  Menu is no different than any other berto, staff is average, leaning toward the \"I am here but don't want to be here\".  But, the restaurant is the cleanest Berto in the valley.  Food is consistently good, not dried out."}
{"text":"Generous portion and almost everything was tasty. Tried the menudo....looks very appetizing, but unfortunately it was very bland."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos EVER. Sorry, Rubio's! 
They're available on door dash in my area, too. Delicious fish tacos right at my doorstep. 
Their other stuff is good too. I love the machaca burrito."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the most incompetent employees I've ever dealt with. I made the mistake of going there today. This is after months of not going there because of the last time they fucked up my order. This morning I went in there to get a taco salad. The bill came to $7.57. I gave him $23.11 because the taco salad was supposed to be $8.11. The cashier told me it was $7.57 so I just handed him the $23. He gave me my change and the receipt. He handed me $.43. I told him that I gave him $23.. He continued to argue with me saying that I gave him $8. I called the police and then I called the corporate office. The corporate office called me back 20 minutes later and said the cash register was balanced. The manager took the $15 and pocketed it to cover him and his employee. When everything was said and done not only did I not get any of my change or any of my money back, I didn't even get the taco salad. I would never go there again. I urged each and everyone of you to stay away from there. When they make mistakes, they refuse to make them right. This isn't the first time that this has happened here either. Please stay away from here if you value your money."}
{"text":"This place is what I would call the \"Speedy Gonzales\" Mexican food.  They remind me of that little Mexican mouse ~ extremely quick, small and ready to go.  

This is a convenient location if your near I17 and Happy Valley.  They are a fast food Mexican joint, but I enjoyed my meal.  

Likes~ it is very cheapo-la to eat here.  I like how they have their restaurant set up with several flat screen TV's broadcasting sports and news (you don't get that at Caramba's nor Carolina's)...  I had their Carne Asada Torta meal.  It was very good and extremely cheap.  I've also had their Carnitas Torta and Burrito and their Pollo Asado Quesadilla, all were very good.  Did I mention they are cheap to eat!

Dislikes ~ NOT Eco-friendly using the dreaded styrofoam, offer only Pepsi products with a few Mexican sodas, no brewed ice tea, no beer and their salsa.

For a quick bite to eat, it's a good place to go for \"Speedy Gonzales\" Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I am an Arizona Native and I have always lumped all the bertos restaurants as the same. But this Federico's is tops. Everything is authentic home made stye goodness!!! My wife love there chialquies, I love the Chile relleno burrito with carne asada, called Martha's favorite The Burrito Bandido!!!!"}
{"text":"This is where to go when all you want is cheap, fast Mexican food from a drive-though window.  It's open 24 hours.  Prices and portions are great.  Don't expect the \"best\" Mexican food.  It's just OKAY here, but it will hit the spot if you have a craving and don't want to spend a lot or get out of your car.  Would not recommend going inside unless you have the time.  I tried going in twice, and they were pretty slow to get food out.  I think they do most business through the drive-thru and really focus more on getting those orders out.

Go on Taco Mondays and Tuesdays when they have 99 cent tacos.  I also like getting the Torta combo (I like it with carnitas) that comes with fries and a drink for under $6.

Bottom line:  Is it great?  No.  Decent cheap eats?  Yes."}
{"text":"My family and I come here quite often. Fast courteous service. I get the Lengua Taco and Abodaba Burrito. This establishment is open 24hours. Not bad for the area do I'm giving it 4 stars and my kids love the roller up taco and quesadilla. My wife likes the chicken tacos. Take the family there is plenty of room. If your in a hurry there is a drive thru!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Family stopped in for dinner and left satisfied. The inside of the place is nice. They had a few televisions playing sports which always is a good start with this guy.  The video menu board was nice and aided in what food looked appealing. 

For dinner we had the carne asada tacos, chimichanga, and their special burrito (shrimp). The tacos were good and tasted fresh. The meat also had good flavor.  The chimi was large, like brick large. It also had good flavor but did lack a little meat and guacamole\sour cream was minimal. Overall though, I would order it again. The special burrito (sorry, forgot the name) was massive. Sadly, that was the only bright spot.  The burrito lacked flavor and was loaded with potatoes over meat.  

The brightest spot was the staff.  The two women working the counter were very outgoing and helpful. I will return based solely on their personalities.  They helped with menu items and checked in with us on a couple of occasions. They definitely went above and beyond and it showed. 

Overall, setting and staff were great and the food was decent. I will stop by in the future to see if four stars is deserving."}
{"text":"I came here on a couple of occasions: (1) Ordered an Arizona burrito to-go. It came out to be almost $9 with the additional sour cream and credit card fees-way too expensive. The burrito was just alright. It wasn't anything to write home about. (2) Got Carne Asada fries with a tortilla, which came out to be over $11. Again, way too expensive. The fries were stale, the steak was old and tasteless, and the guacamole was flavorless. Shame, I live right down the street because I don't think I'll be coming here again. 

Be prepared to pay an additional $0.50 if you're paying with credit card."}
{"text":"Those who read my reviews know we try a LOT a Mexican places and Federico's was just unfortunately bland and tasteless. The enchiladas tasted like nothing. And the fish tacos were like a crunchy nothing. I have never tried Mexican that was so lacking in flavor.

The presentation was good and the prices fair. The meal certainly LOOKED like it would be delicious. It just wasn't really anything. Strangest meal we may ever have had."}
{"text":"I like several things about Federico's:

1 - It's close to my house.
2 - It's inexpensive.
3 - They have large portions.
4 - The food tastes good.
5 - Service is friendly.

The only thing I don't like is the iced tea.  It doesn't taste very good and isn't fresh brewed.

Overall, Federico's is a good option in this part of town for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food is descent for the prices they started with. Now they overcharge. I recently ordered a carne asada burrito with beans and they charged me $7.14. My jaw dropped. They need to reevaluate their prices before they lose clientèle."}
{"text":"They weren't really attentive when it came to ordering. They did however get the order right and in a timely manner. It was pretty good price wise but the food was just alright. It didn't explode with flavor but it'd probably hit the spot at 1-2AM when you are faded. The rice was better tasting than my burrito!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The owner Jesse is great. He leads his team by example to give the best food and service!
Food is always hot and fresh. Salsa bar is always full and the place is clean!"}
{"text":"The place was clean, and I was pleased to see the \"A\" ratings posted on the wall, but that's pretty much where the positive comments end. The prices were a bit high but I thought that would equate to a good quality product. I was wrong. The beef taco was cooked to death and lacked flavor. The fish tacos were the worst I've ever had. The fish was over cooked and very fishy tasting, an indication it's not fresh. Instead of shredded cabbage, they had lettuce. I was very disappointed. The rice was fluffy, but otherwise bland.
I will not return to Federicos."}
{"text":"This is the Cadillac of drive tru Mexican. Fast and perfect food. Love the rolled tacos and bacon breakfast burritos. 24 hours so you can your food on after the bar."}
{"text":"I my opinion, they are one of the best late night post drinking burrito joints. The are quaility for there type of restaurant, this is why I gave them five stars. They also have pepsi not coke. The are clean on the inside which is rare for a cheap mexican place."}
{"text":"just moved to surprise from southern CA and since I used to work in Los Angeles and my wife is 1/2 Hispanic/Mexican I LOVE and LIVE for good Mexican food. tonight was first visit and so far I love this place. now still not as good as the taco carts and hole in the wall places in los angeles but very good. also, finally found a place in AZ that used SPICES. seems like everyone here catering to the elderly in sun city with no salt, pepper, and SPICEs. had carne asada taco and was good but meat a little dry. My holy grail is a chili relleno. had the chili relleno burrito and 10 minutes later still have a nice mild hotness in my mouth. my favorite so far of ALL chili rellenos I have ever had. salsas good. will be stopping again next week to try a combo so I can rate the beans and rice. a staple in Mexican places. did see a can of La Victoria sauce in the kitchen so I only rated 4 stars."}
{"text":"24 Hour Mexican Joint! A plus! I love getting off work at 2-3 A.M. and being able to stop by this place for a late night meal. On Monday's it is buy one get one for Military Personnel and I definitely take advantage of that. The menu had a good variety to it but I love their Pollo Asado plate with a large Horchata. I will always be a regular here as long as it's on my way home."}
{"text":"Ok got the carne nachos again, this time it was horrible, the meat was so bland- they charged me 10 for a half order that was pretty much a full order, I'm from south San Diego and this wouldn't fly....not going back again-"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. It's not a high-end Mexican place by a stretch, but they do a solid job at making really tasty meals for a really cheap price. It's amazing how fast the drive-through can be even when there are 15 cars lined up around the building.

Service is friendly and quick both inside and in the drive-through."}
{"text":"The food here is never the problem, but for the life of me they can never seem to get our order right. From the time we order to the time we drive around to the window it is always forgotten, messed up or scrambled. 2 number 19's and a bean and cheese burrito doesn't seem that difficult to remember but we usually get some combination of the three but never all three on the first try. One day!"}
{"text":"If you are familiar with Mexican drive through places like this, then you know this one is a good one, tacos were great, beans yummy, rice was decent, etc..."}
{"text":"I am not happy with this place because they lie about their prices when you order in the drive thru saying one price then they charge a whole different price. A meat quesadilla in drive says $8.79 but charge me $10.19 and quesadilla saying $3.99 but get charged $4.29. When I ask them they said we haven't changed the prices. But it has been like this for months so for the most part have been lying about the prices. They are going to change but never do, so basically ripping people off. So please fix your prices already."}
{"text":"I ordered Arizona burritos they were really good however, the prices have definitely gone up since the last visit. Burritos are 7.16 now but we like the flavor and the fresh chunky salsa they have inside. I suggest you go inside to order your food so you have access to their great selection of salsas."}
{"text":"I got to give it to them. This was probably the best Federicos I have been to. The prices have gone up a little but the taste of the food was great. The burritos and carne asada fries I ordered were huge. Definitely will be making my rounds out there again."}
{"text":"They gave us old guacamole and salsa that hadn't been stored properly and tasted rancid, the beef had no seasoning or tenderized . Sour cream was expired never again!"}
{"text":"Going back 17 years this building was my introduction to 24 hr Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  My sister, the frugal one, recommended this place because you could get a chimichanga for $3.50, split it, bring your own water and have a budget dinner night out.  Her husband is still skinny.:-)  The building was originally a Taco Bell and I think maybe a Filberto's along the way.  Currently it is undergoing a repaint and a new facade.

I got my normal #5 (beef taco, cheese enchilada with rice and beans, $5.79) and a small Horchata ($1.39).  The food was as I expected, filling, ok taste.  What I have come to expect. The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly"}
{"text":"When I first moved here it was a Mic-Nics which is no more.  A few years back Federico's acquired the property and cleaned it up and painted it a bit brighter.  This location is open 24 hours but the dining room closes from 1-5AM.  It's a chain that started in New Mexico and expanded to Arizona at some point in time. They already had a presence here in 93 and was my first introduction to 24 hour taco shops.  I haven't been to one in a while for no particular reason, except maybe they were not in my path when I wanted Mexican.

Having expanded here from New Mexico instead of the San Diego area like Filberto's and their many copy cats there are some differences in how identical menu items are prepared.  I had my standard plate of shredded beef taco and a cheese enchilada with beans and rice ($5.79) and a med fountain drink ($1.49).  First thing I noticed was there was no grease in the taco.  That may have been part of the slight flavor difference.  Also the cheese enchilada was made with a corn tortilla instead of the more common flour.  I thought they were a bit stingy with the cheese on both items, but I like lots of cheese on almost anything.

In general everything was clean and while I was there the tables were cleaned off and the salsa station was checked and neatened up.  This was a Wednesday lunch and three tables were in use and a few take out orders handled.  Only one person spoke English, and then only just enough to get his job done."}
{"text":"Our whole family loves this place. My picky son gets the cheese quesadilla, it's about the size of a pizza pan! My daughter loves the bean burrito. My husband has tried a few things and enjoyed them all. I like that all the salsas are self serve. The staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Good, fast & reliable Mexican food.  Tacos are relatively HUGE...two are quite filling.  Excellent portion size to price ratio.  Good for lunch or takeaway.  The dining area is unimpressive but, hey, I'm not there for atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite fast good Mexican place so far in Surprise. I have tried their Carne Asada breakfast burritos, Huevos Rancheros, Rolled tacos (my personal favorite), torta, and chimichanga. Their chips and chunky salsa are amazing to add to your meal and their fountain drink Pepsi is amazing! I don't know what the difference between their Pepsi and other restaurants Pepsi's but theirs is def quite tasty. The reason I only gave this place 3 stars is because they have on multiple occasions messed up my order, as well as taking forever to get me my order. On top of that their was a huge incident with their Litchfield park location of food poisoning, and they have had multiple violations...I hope this is not the case for this place."}
{"text":"Worst flautas/taquitos I have ever had, couldn't even take a bite, it was so over cooked and hard the meat tasted dehydrated I was only able to eat one. :-("}
{"text":"Typical \"bertos\"-style Mexican joint, BUT.... The $1.99 red chicken burrito on Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday is the bomb.  Ginormous, meaty and just spicy enough. Can't beat the value."}
{"text":"I've had the fish tacos once before and they were so good! Tonight I got a chicken burrito, and it was so delicious! I think I have enough left over for my lunch tomorrow it was so big. The salad is super yummy too... put that shit on everything!!! So gooood!"}
{"text":"Quick and cheap but great food. Love the matchaca breakfast burrito, the carne asada burrito and the chile relleno plate.

I've come here several times and it is consistently good, and fresh. I would highly recommend it for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru ordered a Carne asada burrito. Waited 15 minutes for the burrito when I got it was cold so I went inside to have them remake it and was told \"well your not the only customer\" there were 2 other people inside. Lay time I checked a customer is a customer and this is a business right?"}
{"text":"Food is good but the portion are getting smaller. I'm thinking ol Federico is falling on some hard times. This was my go to place when I wanted mexican food but I think I'm gonna have to find another place to get more bang for my buck"}
{"text":"Usually, it is on the spot.  We are regulars and tonight we just did not have a good experience.  

My wife went through drive thru and there was quite a line.  No big deal.  Good things for those who wait.

The problem was the food.  We both ordered Carne Asada Burritos and the tortillas were very tough on both.  The meat was very salty.  Just not good.

We expect more out of you, Federico's."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I'd nothing special. Just came with the family, had a burrito, 6 tacos, chips and 2 drinks and it was $32. They will never get my money again. Way better food at Chipotle."}
{"text":"This is a great family owned restaurant. Their taco Tuesday deals are great in the tacos are a good size. They're only $1.50 and you have three choices chicken shredded beef and ground beef. The whole family loved it."}
{"text":"The super nachos and chicken tacos are awesome. Great orchata too, and more authentic then any other fancy Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   I would say it depends on what you get..

Positives:
I was surprised at how nice this little place was on the inside. Very clean and had some TVs. The staff was very friendly!  

We got a Chimichanga, carne Asada tacos and the special shrimp burrito. The chimi was tasty, for a faster food type of place. The shrimp burrito I would NOT recommend. The tacos were very good! 

Negatives:
I did not care for the shrimp burrito. It was mostly potatoes and lacked flavor big time. Good thing the other dishes were shared with me to compensate 

I will go here again since it is located so close by. I will be getting the tacos this time!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop by Federico's on my lunch break. I had ordered a number #19 ( rolled tacos, rice, beans) And mentioned to the young lady NO guacamole on those ( because I am allergic ) I also ordered an AZ burrito. I thought the burrito was pricy $7.69! Wow almost $8, but hey maybe they don't skimp and the burrito was gonna come out fat and bomb. 

 I was on a time limit they had already took awhile but no biggie fresh food, right!?  I had a little time to chow down before clocking in. So, I'm at a red light and im like let me check these rolled tacos... ***bam*** guacamole all over them. I was livid simply because I went in the drive thru bc I had limited time. Now I have to get off and deal with this.

Went inside and the girl knew already, \" it has guacamole\" yes, it does. She also asks, Do u have your receipt? My response, idk if u even gave me one I'm in a hurry. She responds, yes I did, I always give receipt. DOES IT MATTER??? ARE YOU GIVING ME A REFUND ON TOP OF THE ORDER YOU MESSED UP!!? cmon now!! Customer service---- you just mentioned to me when I stepped inside it has guacamole ? Before I said anything but now u want receipt ? This makes no sense. 


Along side that freakin mess the $8 burrito was skinny , not fat and bomb like I had hope I was paying for- there red sauce is off- it's too thick and lacking some flavor. 


Just check your food before leaving . I won't be returning to many Mexican drive thrus to pick from, and with the portion and flavors, customer service . nope-- 

My order was $20.65"}
{"text":"Very yummy been there twice now and have been happy with my orders.  I got the burrito de lengua the first time and the enchilada combo plate the second.  It's not a home made version but the restaurant version. It's pretty decent I would certainly go back to try the rest of the menu as well I gave it 4 stars instead of three because I'm extremely picky on the rice. If it does not taste good I won't even bother with the rest if the menu. This rice however was very good! Good texture good quality good flavor! I'm excited to try the rest if the dishes."}
{"text":"Waste of money. You eat better in a jail. It was over priced and although convenient due to the fact they are open 24hrs I would rather go else where. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I guess you have to have one star but I feel this should be lower.
The last few times I have eaten from here they have not actually cooked the food you can tell the cheese is not melted.
Now they will not give out hot sauce??????
Not sure what's happened to this place but I will not be back.
Can only imagine what others are not posting.
Good bye and thanks for playing"}

Clean dinning area and bathroom 
Kitchen clean (you can see it from the counter)

When an owner / manager can check all of those boxes they are doing it right


I'll be back!!!"}

YUMM OTHER PLACES HERE IN KINGMAN ARE NOT GOOD HUMBERTOS IS GOOD BUT FEDRICOS WAS BETTER PRICED love u guys will past the word"}
{"text":"Boring. Bland. Over cooked meat. If this is authentic Mexican food, you are shaming Mexico. Great that they are open late, and the prices are good. Prepare for the meal with no less than 72 napkins to mop up the grease from the meat...which you would think would be a sign of meat that had been cooked right, and would be moist, but it's not. It is rubbery over cooked poor quality meats, slathered in seasonings and marinades and served right out of the greasy mess they were cooked in for far too long. Avoid this place unless it's your only option. Oh, and they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"The food is OK but, their customer service is horrible! That's probably the reason no one is ever there."}
{"text":"Looked for a Mexican joint after going to the drive in. Food is pretty bomb! Got their carne Sada fries and their mixed burrito. AmAzing!!"}
{"text":"Having been here many times, I decided to try something new.  I tried the Bandido Burrito (Carne Asada, Chile Relleno, Guacamole), $5.99.  It was amazing and very filling.  The combination of Carne Asada & Chile Relleno w/Guac was perfect.  One of my favorite Taco Shops in AZ.

Return Factor - 95%"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Clean Fast & Friendly. Burritos & Chicken Taco were Hot & tasty. Had 2 of each and a soda under $10.  Monday Tuesday Wednesday it's 2.50 for burrito & 1.25 for tacos. So inexpensive as well."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here for an inexpensive date. There wasn't much of a wait at all. Fish Tacos were great! She had the burrito & enchilada plate also very tasty. Both came with a nice size portion of the usual retried beans rice. $22.00"}
{"text":"Very average. Tried 3 times. 1st time was some different combos. They were alright. Next time breakfast burritos. Pretty good, but I've had better. Final time was different tacos. Pre-made shells were tasteless as was the chicken and beef. Fish tacos okay, but get better at Rubios. Even though restaurant is close by, we drive farther to get better Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Stopped here for a road trip treat on my way home. Special ordered a shrimp and carne asada burrito and it was amazing!!

I have no idea why this place doesn't have better reviews. I am pretty picky and it was definitely up to snuff. Nice staff, clean place, and good food. Will come back!"}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. Food is typical of what you'd expect. Prices are slightly higher than you'd expect. If you order tacos eat them at the restaurant! we basically live across the street and the tacos go soggy by the time we get home. Staff is always friendly and little salsa bar is always stocked. Never had a problem with the food or staff."}
{"text":"First, let me say I've been coming here for about a year and half. Probably 10-15 visits total. I will never come back.  

Today's experience at the drive thru went like this: \"*something*, *something*, *something*, order?\"
Me: \"I can barely hear you\". 
Employee: \"*something* *something*, *something* order?\" 
Me: \"OK. I'll have a carne asada fries and two bean and cheese burritos with onions\". Employee: *something*, *something*, *something* else?\" 
Me: 'I can barely hear you, but if you're asking if I want anything else, the answer is no\". Employee: \"*something*, you\". 

There was one car ahead of me in the drive thru. 12 minutes later, I'm at the window. This was bad enough, but the CF that took place next was nothing short of amazing. I sat there for another 3-4 minutes before a clueless gentleman wearing sunglasses came to the window and asked: \"What was your order?\". Me: \"Carne asada fries and two bean and cheese burritos with onions\". Employee: \"Did someone take your money yet?\". OH MY GOD. Me: \"No.\" Employee closes the window and walks away. 3-4 minutes later, he comes back and says \"so, carne asada fries and a bean burrito?\". How high is this guy? Me: \"NO! Carne asada fries and TWO bean and cheese burritos with ONIONS\". Sunglasses employee closes the window again and wanders away. 2-3 minutes later a woman comes to the window: \"what was your order?\" You have GOT to be kidding me! At this point I'm looking for the hidden camera and someone to pop out and tell me I'm on Candid Camera. I tell her AGAIN, exactly what my order is. She closes the window and opens it a few seconds later and finally takes my card. A minute later she gives me my food. I ask, \"is there red sauce in there?\"  She says \"yes\". No apology for the epic CF, nothing. I leave, knowing full well that my order would be screwed up, despite the FOUR TIMES I had to give them my order. Sure enough: no onions on my bean and cheese burritos and no red sauce in the bag. What is wrong with these people?  They lost a customer today. No excuse for any of that nonsense today."}
{"text":"Bought some carne asada fries right now and there was hardly any cheese on them and I paid like 11 bucks for them. On top of that! The lady asks me what kind of sauce I want I asked for green and red sauce and I get home to realize she only put red  

Very bad service !"}
{"text":"This place is nasty. I ordered 3 rolled tacos with cheese with carne asada on top. Everything looked good until I bit into to it to find old smelly chicken inside. Not only could you taste it was bad when I pulled the meat out u could smell it was bad. The one young guy I spoke to looked at me like he didn't care about nothing I was telling him. He wouldn't even look me in the face. This location will never get my money again."}
{"text":"Meh, I think it's better than Filibertos! They have a shrimp burrito that's decent, and the prices aren't bad. They have a good selection of breakfast burritos that you can order all day."}
{"text":"Federico I am so glad you are close! After band practice, before and/or after football games or just coming home from a hard days work.  This is always a good price and great food and personable employees"}
{"text":"We went again to Federico's ordered num 6 and found out the burrito is with shredded beef NOT just beans as the employee in my previous comment told me so on top of everything she lied to me!  soooo disappointed with this place! I wish people would pay more attention to their receipts."}
{"text":"I've to I have to put a star but I would not. I was very hungry and decided to go through something to take away. I order a combo with burrito and enchilada. It is the worst meal I have ever eaten in my life. burned meat made with the leftovers of the vegetable that should be used for broth or something where you do not see that you are using something of poor quality. smoked and sour beans with an extremely high temperature in the danger zone. remember that refried beans are ready to eat and keeping them on a steam table for more than 4 hours could make anyone sick."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. My order was wrong. I called the location and the person who finally got on the phone to talk to me was very rude. When I Asked what her name was she hung up on me. Drove the food back to get a refund. The person who hung up on me was Isabelle. She told me she had worked there for two years and I could call who ever I wanted. Nothing would happen to her. Then I had to sit their while she talked to the other staff as she interrogated them about my nachos. Finally received my refund. Sadly, I will never return."}
{"text":"Stopped on my way home from church on Sunday morning. I ordered the Carnitas dinner all rice no beans. Folks let me tell you it was horrible, I couldn't even eat it!!! The meat was dry little strands that crunched when you ate it. The rice was bland and had no flavor at all. I was so disappointed. I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"I love this place! They're been and cheese burritos is fantastic. The carne asada burrito is huge! Tuesday tacos are cheap and filling. All three; shredded beef, ground beef, and shredded chicken are yummy. Their tortas are wonderful; the bun is just right every time. I prefer the carne asada. The street tacos are also another one of my favorites with red sauce. 
My new favorite is the grilled chicken salad with light oil. Yummm!
Have never had bad food here."}
{"text":"OMG!  Can't believe they have one in North Scottsdale, only 2 miles from my home, sssssoooo Happy, but Dangerous!  Great Mexican Food, and Great prices!  Close to my 24hr fitness, so at least I will be able to work out, before I have a Giant Green Chili, or Bean Burrito, my Husband loves the Fish Burrito!"}
{"text":"That is the worst excuse for Mexican food I've ever seen in Phoenix area, ordered 2 chimichangas, full of bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, very little shredded beef, what was there could not be chewed, told the staff, they seemed more concerned with their phones than the customer, so we trashed it & tried the green chili plate, that was terrible also, meat was tough & could not be chewed, will never go back, first visit, should have went to Rio Elmirage or Mi Famalia, don't go here to eat, it's junk Mexican food , I would be embarrassed to call it Mexican food !"}
{"text":"I had great hopes, and indeed the food is decent, if you can get past finding hairs in the beans and one of the tacos. And even that I could deal with, if the staff had cared. They didn't. They smiled, said Oh sorry, and went on to help the next customer. 

Sorry but I will not be back. YEECH!"}
{"text":"we go to this place often only because it's right around the corner from where we live and the price is okay and you get a helluv a lot food.

we have never tried the drive thru.  we always dine in.  we have ordered different taco, burrito combos and some bean & fries dish.  not the best food but above average for mexican fast food.

the service is okay and at times they mess up your order.  we never had any complications with fixing our orders.  just sitting and waiting to get our new orders.  if you are not in shape and love fried food this is the place."}
{"text":"I've came to this location a few times and to be honest the food was never great. I usually stick with the carne asada fries because it's the best, and most edible, item I've had here. Today I decided to give their menudo a try because I was craving it. HUGE mistake! It wasn't even edible and most of it was thrown in the trash. There was enough salt in the broth to kill a horse and I had more bones than tripe. I'm amazed that anyone would think this food. I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm not going to sit here and tell you that Federico's is the best Mexican food in Arizona.  I can't do that.  BUT it is a great 'greasy spoon' restaurant that always hits the spot.  It is a convenient location and the drive-thru is fairly quick.  It's a step above fast food.  I've probably hit the drive-thru at least a dozen times over the course of the last 3-4 months. I've never gotten a hint of food poisoning, but I've always stuck with basic / popular combo items on the menu.  I've never stepped foot inside of the place so I cannot comment on their cleanliness or in-person customer service. I will say that Federico's has always served me up a healthy portion of Mexican food.  I've had their tostadas, tacos, carne and enchiladas and all of these items have always cured my cravings. Again, I'm not saying this is absolutely the BEST Mexican food in Arizona.  I'm simply stating that for convenience, portion-size and value, I would not hesitate to continue hitting up their drive-thru for a quick, easy meal."}
{"text":"We gave this place a few chances but tonight was the last time. We've never had issues with the other Federico's, only this location at Dysart/Cactus. I hope they get rid of the manager, but I won't know cause I won't be coming back. Ordered at the drive thru, tried to use my Willow Canyon Football fundraising card, like I've used at all other locations  with no problem, and this location with changing terms. Last time I tried to use it, they told me I had to tell them at the time of order so they could tell the cook (probably to skimp on the order). This time the person taking the order called the manager on the phone and came back to say I could only use the card for a bean and cheese burrito. Cancelled my order and left. Don't sign up to support a fundraiser if you can't follow through on terms or keep a straight story."}
{"text":"Whenever Im in this area of town and I need a fast-food place, I always hit up Federico's. 

Call me boring, but I LOVE bean and cheese burritos. And this place really does an excellent job on them.  They are about 3 times the size of a lot of local spots nearby and the beans taste like the ones my Nana used to make. And Im convinced my Nana made the best beans around.  They also add a white cheese (asadero) to them which tastes a heck of a lot better than the standard cheddar that some places add to their burritos.

I havent tried anything else here so my review is based strictly on the bean and cheese burritos.  If I lived a bit closer, I would try some other items on the menu, but for now please take my word that these burritos are really good. Havent been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Ordered fish tacos, #13? It was absolutely delicious! The staff was pretty friendly, and the wait wasn't too long..it was about 2 hours after lunch, so that's probably why. I'm a big fish taco foodie and the one from here was pretty good! Also, the salsa bar was great! Great tasting red and green sauces, and I loved how it was covered to keep it's freshness. Definitely got my monies worth with this place! There is also a drive thru!"}
{"text":"The torta did not have any flavor and the beans were warm but not enough to melt the cheese that was places on top. :-\"}
{"text":"Omg horrible chicken enchilada. Chicken is usually mild but last nite was a nightmare. So fricking spicy hot I nearly threw up. I couldn't eat it. Beans are watered down. Get it together, or never coming back. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have come here a few times for late dinners, to grab burritos and they were good! I'm only giving this two stars because of this last experience. I had ordered a bean and cheese with potatoes and pico (which I have ordered before so I know what I should be expecting) and got a burrito FILLED with onions. So we took it back, they have a sign that literally says \"bring food back within 24 hours for a refund\" and the lady was so rude saying \"why didn't you get the pico on the side. this is the LAST time.\" Implying that this was the last time she'll remake a burrito for us. Instead of realizing something wasn't right and apologizing decided to give us attitude and a rude response to the issue."}
{"text":"I have to say, every time I've been here, I'm greeted by the nicest people! On top of that, I've never had an issue with my food and i've never had to wait as long as I have at other similar places. The friendly service is what really prompted me to write a review on this location, however. :)"}
{"text":"Open 24!

It's in the hood, no doubt...

The pollo Asado plate is as good as can be!
The plate was piled so high with chicken...

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Carne Asada Burrito this past Friday evening. It was divine!! Especially liked the fact they didn't skimp on the protein. Way to go! 

I did utilize their drive-thru services and so I can't comment on the inside décor, etc.

Neighborhood, however, is less than desirable being located on VanBuren. VanBuren Street in the Valley of the Sun does pride itself w/being the \"pay for play\" street. ;)

This is yet another dangerous temptation I face on my route home now. *sigh*. Can't wait to try another menu item! :)"}
{"text":"I will give this place 4 stars because there is no other Mexican fast food place in the area. It's just like any other fast food Mexican place, filebertos, losbetos ect. The breakfast burritos and good and so is the carne asada burrito. It's kind of expensive for a Mexican fast food joint, but then again it's in Scottsdale. Staff is friendly! Salsa is a little bland. Convent drive through service. Nothing spectacular but still good stuff! The closest Mexican fast food place is off Indian bend so it nice to have this one located in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for fast food, late night munchies or some legit Mexican food, look no further than Federico's.  they offer amazing all-day breakfast burritos, phenomenal Carne Asada burritos, tasty Pico De Gayo/Chips and a mean Super Nacho.  Save yourself the risk of food poisoning from a Taco Bell and give this clean, friendly and fast restaurant a shot."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  This is the soggy mess you just handed me in the drive thru but I was already on the 303 so couldn't take it back!  $7 of my hard earned money in the trash!  Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Mexican food (that is more of a \"fast food\" and drive through) that you can find on the West Side.  The drive through does have a wait because the food is cooked to order not already made when you to order.  The owners are incredibly kind and passionate about their food - also work very well with fundraising efforts in local schools."}
{"text":"Really how does this place only have 3 stars ? If you are looking for a really CLEAN restaurant this is the place . The food is great the beans are as good as my home cooked ones. Priced so reasonable ! Give it a try u won't be disappointed ... Our only problem is now that we found this place we don't want to go anywhere else & find our selfs eating there 3 times a week !! Finally a good Mexican restaurant in Arizona !!"}
{"text":"Just tried them tonight 2/23/18

Highly disappointed, beef taco was disgusting. Couldn't eat it, spit it in the garbage

Makes Taco Bell seem good"}
{"text":"I love breakfast burritos. My usual place was closed but was supposed to be open. So I was searching for a place at 3 a.m. to get a breakfast burrito. And the only place that was open happen to be this place. I had my reservations but I decided to give it a try. And I was not disappointed! One of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had. I will now use this place for my breakfast burrito needs from now on."}
{"text":"I had the chicken taco meal.  The chicken was flavorful yet the shell stayed crunchy.  I would definitely order that again.  I can't wait to try something else!"}
{"text":"It use to be good, however now it is overpriced and not good. I live literally across the street and when I got my food home it was cold. The Carne Asada in my burrito was cold and even the cheese in the enchiladas wasn't even melted! Staff was very unfriendly and I paid $20 for two combo meals.  I would rather go to Taco Bell at this point. Good thing we live in Phoenix where there is more choices.  Quite a shame."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for fast, inexpensive Mexican food! Food quality is always consistent and service is always very fast. There isn't much that my family and I don't like from here -- regular tacos, enchiladas, burritos and rice and beans are fantastic. My personal favorites are the carne asada burrito and cheese enchiladas. My husband loves the ground beef tacos and cheese quesadillas. It's all good, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I'm in town visiting family and my grandpa brought us here for breakfast. I was very impressed with the food and the staff! They greeted everyone and the manager recognized my grandpa and made sure to greet him and ask him how he was doing. Everyone went above and beyond. I will be sure to come back every time I visit. I was full by the time I was half through the Machaca plate"}
{"text":"Pasen a probar los diferentes platillos de comida mexicana todo esta fresco y muy rico bastantes tipos de carne para probarlos en los    típicos burritos k Ají se sirven"}
{"text":"Suprisingly the food is pretty good. The pastor meat taste good n asada is just ok for me. $1.50 for the small tacos n $3 for the larger tacos. Its a very small establishment with 5 booths n 1 longer booth facing the cashier. Price is pretty reasonable i guess, they do have a bathroom also didn't look like it at first. It's chill, would i come back? Maybe if i were in the area again but i wouldn't make the drive just to do it. I'll leave it with that!"}
{"text":"Last night i went to this location to get dinner for My family. The wait was over 30 minutes in the drive thru. Then when i got home, half of my order was missing. I returned to get the rest of my food i gave them my reciept they said it was the wrong reciept. I told them it was the only one given to me. They didnt believe me about it, but finally they remade my order. Then my wife and i where eating our food, it was disgusting i threw mine in the trash, already upset woke up at 3am with food poisoning causing me to call into work. I'll never return to this location again."}
{"text":"came here for lunch and ordered the green chile burrito.. it was ok, home made tortilla was really good. Lots of good looking things on the menu. will be back to try some other things"}
{"text":"I love Fredericos! This place serves legit Mexican food at a reasonable price. It's not fancy, but it's fresh and the Carne Asada is the best anywhere. Great because they are open late too!"}
{"text":"Open 24hrs. Which is probably one of the reason why we decided to go here, since everything else was close and we wanted to get our grub on. Came here with the family and order 4 soft carnita tacos, 2 carne asada fries, and a steak quesadilla. Wanted to throw in a few hard shell tacos for $0.99, but apparently that price is only good on Tuesdays, and regular price was $2.19. WTF?! Anyways, I was not too pleased with the outcome. The meat for the tacos were WAY too dry and the fries were way too soggy! When we asked for salsa and sour cream to-go, the cashier lady said that they didn't have any. Obviously, that is a lie! After getting her to admit that they do have it, and after charging us $0.65, we got our salsa and sour cream. Needless to say, we will not coming back here."}
{"text":"I stopped in yesterday to try the place out. I had to try the cheese enchiladas to try out their sauce. I can be a bit of a snob and find that the enchilada sauce and salsa can tell a lot. The staff was really friendly and I even asked about an item that was on their website that said it was not available at all locations. They took the time to make a call to see if they could honor it. There was a good salsa selection and they had the carrots and onions I really like. Also, they had sliced cucumber on their salsa bar that I enjoyed very  much... The entire experience was very pleasant for me and I look forward to next time."}
{"text":"This is an ok place to eat if you're not close to any other Mexican restaurants, the food is alright if you catch the good cook on duty and the service is above average. For the amount of food you get this place is very pricey but it's the only one of its kind in northern Surprise. I would say only stop here is you have a serious craving for this type of food and a lot of money in your pocket"}
{"text":"I was there last week.  Used my credit card and was charged $0.50 more than the correct amount.  This is the second time this has happened.  $0.50 might not be a lot of money, but it's deceitful to purposely add this amount to the total bill."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been here during daylight. Or even before 10pm. I'm thankful they are open 24 hours, as very few places close to home are (I think McDonald's is - on weekends). Greasy, completely bad for you, huge portion, cheap, but always tasty Mexican food. Decent end to curb any late night cravings on the way home from a night out!"}
{"text":"Federico's Scottsdale location has not been able to maintain the consistent quality since its original opening. The prices have also gone up twice since its opening. The first 6 months, I was ecstatic about having a quality faster-food Mexican place in Scottsdale, near Shea/Raintree corridor. My March 2015 trip, I wondered whether to go back again. The quality of the ground beef was absolutely not there. I ordered a ground beef burrito and a ground beef enchilada plate. It looked great and tasted flavorless, over-cooked, too dry. My teen daughter didn't even help me eat the leftovers. That is a good test! Their re-fried beans are great!"}
{"text":"I'll pretty much always go back because they are so close and delicious, but the service here is definitely lacking. 

I'd say about half the time, they get our order wrong, which is bizarre since we're there so often and pretty much always order the same thing. 

One time we ordered a bean and cheese burrito, and a kid's carne asada quesadilla, and they made us a normal sized quesadilla and a bean/carne asada burrito... which was pretty gross. 

The staff is rarely polite, and get annoyed when you ask for green sauce. They still get three stars though because the food is crazy yummy!"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Never a long wait for food. Food is great. Drive thru is convenient. Can always call ahead as we usually do to save on the wait time."}
{"text":"This place has really become a chit hole.  My family and I ate here the other night and were completely repulsed by the whole experience.  When we approached the cash register gal to place our order, she did not bother to acknowledge our presence in any way.  No hello, no smile, no eye contact, nothing.  We wondered if she was open.  We asked her if she was open and she shrugged yes, never once looking up at us.  Then my wife asked a question about an item on the menu board and she continued to ignore us as if we didn't exist.  After a moment of awkward silence, the gal at the other register chimed in to answer our question.  We then continued to place our order with no acknowledgment, smile, or eye contact from her.  It made us feel very uncomfortable about ordering food from people like this.  Seriously, do I really want to eat food prepared by people who lack the intelligence and professionalism to communicate?  We wondered if maybe she was unable to speak English, but nope, we heard her speak English just fine after we left.  I half wondered if her attempt to conceal an apparent acne problem with thick coats of makeup interfered with her ability to speak, let alone smile.  Anyway, we ordered three drinks, but only got two.  We didn't even bother with the hassle of going back to her again to order one single drink.  My wife and daughter had to share a drink.  We also ordered chips with our meal, but got chips covered in pico de gallo instead.  The salsa bar was completely empty and filthy with salsa spilled everywhere and mixed into one another.  It was so disgusting looking that we opted to do without salsa.  As we ate our meals, we became even more repulsed by the uncleanliness of the table we were sitting at.  The table was sticky and covered in dried up salsa that looked to have been there quite a while.  To make matters worse, this place allows dirty transient (homeless) people to hang out inside their restaurant pestering patrons for money.  Something about the sight and smell of a dirty transient person whose entire ass is showing because his pants are so low that really ruins an appetite.  The guy acted so strangely that I spent my entire meal on alert watching every move he made.  I was sure he was going to rob the place or start a fight with one of the customers.  I can't believe that this restaurant allows this sort of thing.  I ordered horchata for myself only to regret it about halfway through my drink when I observed the cash register gal dip her entire hand straight from the cash register (and arm) into the horchata mixture to unclog the machine or something.  That was it, we dumped our meals and left.  The cash register gal has no business working in customer service.  In all honesty, she is better suited for the DMV.  Also, the manager of this restaurant has no business managing restaurants.  Eat at your own risk people."}
{"text":"Thanks Fredericos, I shit my pants for two weeks because of your carne! :) just like Taco Bell did me a couple years ago."}
{"text":"The food tastes great and they give large portions. They are also military friendly."}
{"text":"Chips were stale, never received the extra salsa I asked for, and the bean & cheese burrito was something I could have made from home myself with canned beans, cheese and a tortilla. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Clean fast very good food that you'll enjoy more than once cause you return . A + I eat here several times per week and enjoy breakfast burritos as welk as combo plates.  Its a nice atmosphere with nice employees.  Even my kids enjoy the food."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for semi-quick carne asada tacos and burritos. I say semi quick because there are days like today where you could be waiting in the drive thru for twenty minutes or so. I ordered a carnitas taco for something different because I always, always lean towards carne asada tacos or fries. I was very impressed with the flavor and amount of meat. So good. They give you two tortillas for each taco so it doesn't break apart half way through. Service here is ok, but could be a bit more friendly. The best part of this place to me besides the carne asada anything is the green sauce. AMAZING! If they bottled it I'd buy it by the tons."}
{"text":"This place? Hit and MISS! 

Sometimes It's amazing, and you're like oh my god, I can't believe I am eating this at 3:30 am!? Sometimes, you are like, man, this meat smells three weeks old I wonder if I'm going to get hepatitis?"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Mexican fast food around, any of their huge breakfast burritos are great."}
{"text":"Dude. The experience with this place was so amusing it was worth the $11 clusterfluff. 

We rolled up at 2am on Christmas Eve after traveling all day then immediately baking pies for Christmas Eve dinner. My stomach was eating itself, and I wanted some dingdang \"real\" Mexican food since there's little of that here in Seattle. A quick Yelp search showed me Federico's was open, and at that point I was willing to eat Arby's.

My boyfriend, brother and I pulled into the drive through and decided what we wanted: a bean burrito for me (not too many vegetarian choices there, but whatevs), and and an order of 5 abodabo tacos each for the guys. So, 10 tacos total.

We pull up and wait at least 10 minutes by the completely blacked out drive through window (why so opaque?!) before a friendly gal took our money and eventually gave us our food.  We get home to find that a.) we were given only one order of 5 tacos; b.) the \"tacos\" = 5 corn tortillas laid flat willy-nilly with a heaping pile of what appears to be overcooked dog food plopped on top; and c.) my bean burrito with cheese is kind of lukewarm, the cheese a cold lump like a dirty secret within the beans' bosom. As someone who doesn't turn down food short of there being body fibers or blood in it, I ate my burrito anyway (and didn't get sick, woot!). My brother passed up on the dog food tacos all together and the boyfriend only ate one-ish before giving up.  This, people, is unheard of behavior from them.

I rarely give any place one star, but this was definitely deserved and made me regret the ridiculous Christmas-Eve-goodwill tip I left."}
{"text":"The customer service is so so but I don't care. The food is what matters. Since moving to Arizona I have yet find a place that makes good chorizo. This place definitely doesn't. It tastes like a white person who never heard of it and made it. I'm white but I really love chorizo for the morning. But I tried other food they made, not impressed. It doesn't take a lot to impress me. Get my order right and make good food, I'm happy. Thing is, it wasn't good. Bland. Been here twice, no intentions of going back."}
{"text":"Wow, this is the cleanest, nicest, best smelling fast food Mexican joint I've ever been to. The tables and chairs are newer & comfortable & even the kitchen looks super clean. I came here this morning for a breakfast burrito & even stayed to read the newspaper (I know, I'm the only one still reading them).  I had the chorizo egg & cheese burro & it did not let me down, in fact it had mote chorizo than most places & it was mixed evenly with cheese & egg. The tortilla didn't seem homemade but it didn't smell like preservatives either. I will most definitely come back to this location since it's close to my office."}
{"text":"This place is excellent for authentic Mexican food. They are inexpensive, friendly and everything is delicious. I highly recommend the carne asada and their breakfast burritos. 

They also have a drive through which is super convenient, although inside the restaurant is fairly quick as well."}
{"text":"CLOSED..... Tried this place on a whim. Drive-thru is what caught my eye! Not very busy... but this is a gem in hiding! I tried the 4 mini tacos for under $4.50 and they were soooo yummy!!! They are a new business but I'm sure once it catches on it's gonna be busy all the time!"}
{"text":"This place is starting to go on my nervous.They take for ever to get the food out and I understand its not a fast food place but they cant even get the order right with no one in line at the drive thru.this happend three times in a row.. Im done with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food. And fresh. This is 3rd time I've been here for my Lunch. Their carne asada fries are amazing and i get their carne asada burrito. Quality is great. Prices are higher but so worth it.. And they do have a senior menu"}
{"text":"Great place if you have a craving for Mexican food and/or if it is late at night and everything else is closed. This place is across the street from my house and I come every now and then when I just need some good Mexican food. Their portions are huge and I can make 2 or 3 meals out of a combo meal sometimes! Not a huge fan of the quesadillas, but everything else I have tried is delicious!"}
{"text":"It's probably not going to come as a surprise that this Federico's is quite a bit nicer than their Van Buren location.  The prices are slightly higher than Filiberto's or Julioberto's, but I think the quality is worth it, you're not going to leave hungry, and we're still talking pretty cheap for what you get.

*Pro tip- I don't know if they still have it, and if it's only this location, but they used to have a binder at the counter with a list of specialty burritos- one for each state in the United States. If you don't see it- ask, because I've never seen it advertised, but it definitely exists(ed).  The Idaho burrito was awesome."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! 
The prices are great, its clean, they actually use vegetable oil and NOT LARD.
Thats right folks, I can actually go through this place late at night and get myself a burrito without the worry of lard! 
YES!  Thank you Federicos! 
I am so looking forward to getting my Black bean/refried bean cheese burrito mix from them. They are located right next to my 2nd job and they are the bomb. 
Also, the burritos are big XD. 
You will not be disappointed either your stomach or wallet if you stop in here."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer at this location for years as they are very close to my home however the customer service has declined a great deal, they basically ignore my requests, I always ask for no lettuce for example however my meal has lettuce on it 70% of the time. I also always ask for extra hot sauce and end up with 2 tiny containers for a big meal for 2 people... The meat is usually minuscule and overcooked. I tried to over look these issues however I can no longer continue to patronize a business that doesn't care about its customer base. I am certain they are unaware that yelp even exists as they have a great many poor reports and haven't changed anything..."}
{"text":"I live close so we thought we'd try it out. Disgusting. Food is so over priced and it took forever to get our order. For the price you'd atleast expect somewhat fresh ingredients. The guacamole is frozen from a bag. You might as well go to chipotle, you'll get much better quality for the same price. I live A mile away and when I got home the food was already cold. It tasted like it had been sitting in a warmer for HOURS. Don't waste your time and money. They should be ashamed for ripping people off this bad."}
{"text":"Make sure you double check your receipt.   They overcharged me two large pints when I asked for two small size.    I wish I would of caught it early but I didn't catch until a week after.    The food is great but the service is terrible and overpriced."}
{"text":"Some of their food tastes like it's been in the refrigerator all week or a couple days since they tried giving me carne asada fries that tasted like they were warmed up for a few minutes then given to me. Also, another time the chicken inside of the red chile chicken burrito I got looked old when I opened up the burrito to see why it had a weird taste and texture after biting into the burrito. I have better luck at Filiberto's since when I go there my food actually tastes and looks fresh."}
{"text":"My go-to after a long day/night! The carne Assada burrito with sour cream in lieu of guacamole will be the first large step to curing what ales you!"}
{"text":"Hi haven't been to this restaurant in a while, however, went first thing this nothing around 10:30 am ordered one bean burrito with cheese and asked if they could put real jalapeños on it they agreed. I also ordered an order of Fries for the kiddos with two shredded beef tacos).
I must say I was very disappointed with this order (Fries, appeared old, cooked in old oil and the last of the bag, they charged me 75cent for the regular carrot peppers I would have gotten for free if I went inside). Moving forward I will be ordering inside if or when I visit this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"I come here for their fish burrito. I LOVE IT!!!!. It is crispy fish with cabbage, special sauce and pico de gallo. I've also tried their huevos ranchero it was good, although I'm not a big fan of runny eggs, I still ate it. I didn't like their ham & egg & cheese burrito, the ham was too salty. Other than that the service is good, drive- thru is always busy.. I'm happy that they're back to business."}
{"text":"Very clean with different meet modern touches that most the Federico's. Same great service ad's good as the other locations. Salsa, carrot bar was a bit smaller, but still had most the same great options."}
{"text":"My favorate is the carne asada, i always get #8 in the combination plate which has 2 carne asada taco with rice beans and guacamole and pico de galo on the side with green sauce perfect...love it!!!"}
{"text":"I come here every single Tuesday. The have $1 tacos and burritos. The red and green sauce is amazing. I have never tried anything other than the tacos (shredded beef, chicken, ground beef) or the burrito (I went with shredded beef). The burrito is large and filling. The tacos are excellent. This place has a drive thru as well and is always busy.

If it's Tuesday and you have a few bucks, stop here."}
{"text":"I usually stop by this restaurant every other week since it is so close to my house, however after dealing with the rude cashiers I won't be back. I've always paid with the same debit card and have never had problems however when I stopped by yesterday I noticed they charged my card twice. I came back and spoke with the younger lady and she told me it's normal it will go away in 24 hrs and there's nothing they can do since their manager isn't there, so she suggested I come back in the morning when the manager will be in the store. I come back a little after 24 hrs of my initial purchase and it still isn't fixed the manager still isn't there. The lady then told me it's usually 72 hrs that I'll see it go back. I found the way they handled my situation rude because then they started speaking in Spanish to each other. I know i can't be mad when people are speaking Spanish in a Mexican restaurant but my problem is they did so in front of me about my situation. I'm done dealing with this over charge of $33.50 and don't care to come back. There are plenty other delicious Mexican restaurants with BETTER customer service."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there just tonight, they put soap in her root beer!  Tasted like soap, suds on inside of the cup, what the heck guys?  Will not return"}
{"text":"The lady at the drive-through is very rude just handed me my food after I think her for handing it to me didn't even ask if I needed anything very bad customer service omg and my food was to salty to eat"}
{"text":"This is the best fast food you can get in the hood. I live in the Garfield, and used to frequent Salsitas on 16th & Roosevelt,  but over the past year the quality is lacking.

The bf and I were super stoked to find this place! They're open late, and the food is ALWAYS fresh.

Literally this is the only fast food place I willingly order rice, it's never old and hard (EW) 

The best part is the excellent customer service.  This place is a total dive so it was unexpected.

Anyways,  embrace the window riddled with bullet holes,  the 50 cent fee for paying with card,  and the gnarly location where multiple shootings/stabbings have taken place. All that matters is the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Federico's is my go to fast food Mexican place! I always get a bean&cheese with potatoes, rice, and sour cream (easy beans), get it next time, it's seriously delicious! They dining room is always extremely clean and well kept, and the bathroom as well! One of the wonderful women that works there remembers me and knows my sauce and burrito preferences by heart! It gets packed during dinner time, but trust me, fresh Mexican food is worth a few minutes wait. OH AND DID I MENTION THEYRE OPEN 24/7?! Sooo convenient. :)"}
{"text":"Grabbed some food while waiting for a checkup next door. Food was great, food was out really fast. Like how clean the place is. Also love that they have a drive thru. Order came out great"}
{"text":"It's a tough call because a friend likes this place but, I just think everything is mediocre at best.   I've gotten a few different burritos and taco combos and haven't been wowed.  The rice is ok, beans are a little salty for my taste, and everything else doesn't have much flavor."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, with last time being yesterday. First, very nice owner works there with his wife, so it is a family business, which I like to support. Second, the place was clean, although they were just cleaning it with Pinesol...I wouldn't use that stuff in a restaurant, it smell awful...but getting past that, they offer great Mexican drinks and pretty good  Los Angeles style Mexican food.  The bean though aren't my favorite style, looks like they use light pinto beans, I like the dark beans. But it was tasty enough. The chips were hot and crispy, a big Plus there.  I had the Taco and Tostada plate. Not bad.  But I do miss my L.A. Mexican food...like Las Fuentes...This is a good second though."}
{"text":"This is the place to stop if you are craving a steak burrito with potatoes. Or if you want your taco fix...instead of going to jack in the box-come here!! No mystery meat served here. Their rolled tacos are delish and they are not stingy for their cheese."}
{"text":"YES! Love em'
2 for 1 Military Mondays is awesome.. because their food is great. 
I have had a few burritos, chimi, and chili rellenos... all amazing.
Also, the staff at this location is great. Always polite, helpful, patient, and will rearrange your order to save you money and get you the same food, SERIOUSLY! You cannot beat it."}
{"text":"Foods OK. Two things you can expect. One hit the curb with your tire in the drive-through. Two you get to meet the only female on the planet who has never smiled"}
{"text":"My wife and I threw away our dinner after a couple of bites. THE WORST!"}
{"text":"The food is good but after eating about half of my food I saw bugs crawling on the Windows behind me, and just just one about a dozen and a couple of dead ones. Also after looking about I there are more bugs crawling on the floor a couple of tables away from me."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say it's terrible, but also not my first pick for Mexican food in the area. I've had the carnitas and carne platters in the past and thought they were fine. Tonight, however, we decided to take advantage of their Tuesday specials on burritos and tacos...

Chicken burrito -- decent marinade (although it may be a tad too spicy for some), and that's about it. They did not do a good job of trimming the fat and gristle, which I recalled of their other meats as well. I understand that fat is good for cooking, but I don't want big chunks of it in my burrito. 

Beef taco -- nothing particularly wrong with it other than its total lack of flavor. They must use a low grade of beef, which is fine except that it's tough and seemingly not at all marinated. It's like the opposite of the chicken, which I don't understand. Isn't beef easier to marinate?

Rice and beans -- as others have noted, they just aren't at all exciting. What a shame, since nothing else on the menu particularly stands out. 

I think I'll be avoiding Federico's in the future. There are too many other good options nearby."}
{"text":"we had the green chili and Arizona burrito. (the bomb). service is great. super clean like it will be  back"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting anything incredible from this place. But I feel like you'd have to make an effort to have bad Mexican food. It was pretty bad. Well, more like just fast food. I had a beef taco and cheese enchilada with rice & beans. Taco was pretty greasy and the cheese enchilada had completely unmelted cheese inside of it. Service was bad and they were mid-cleaning everything when we came in to eat. Which was 2pm on a Saturday. I don't want to see that! Yuck.."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love this place! We always order the same thing every time!
Arizona Burrito w no pico
super nachos w no pico
And carne asada fries."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this location I have problem with my order but this time even worse 
I ordered Arizona burrito and the fries were UNCOOKED
Like how do you put uncooked fries inside a sandwich? 
I'm very disappointed"}
{"text":"Finally a fast food Mexican joint by my house!  This place is just like the others.  The food is just as expected so if you like it dirty Mexican style then you won't be disappointed at all. I ordered a California burrito and a kids bean and cheese burrito.  Both were excellent.  It's even open until midnight!  Late night Mexican food cravings are in my future now."}
{"text":"After looking at all the comments about how great the carne asada fries were here, I decided to try them out. No bullshit! The carne asada fries at this location are probably the best here in Az, BUT I also tried the rolled tacos with guacamole & they were horrible at this location. I looked inside the rolled taco & there was a little strand of meat. They hide the meat with all the guacamole they put over the rolled tacos. Overall I wasn't pissed cause the carne asada fries were bomb here"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.   This was our first visit.  We had the chorizo plate with rice and beans.  Restaurant was very clean and updated.  Food portions were large and high quality.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Ermahgerd, it's Taco Tuesday!!.. Monday, and Wednesday.  Genuine soft or hard taco's with corn tortillas for a buck, three days out of the week?  I'm sold!  I tried the shredded beef, the ground beef, as well as the chicken tacos.. they were amazing! And if you are more a fan of street tacos, they got those too.. maybe next review i will talk about their burritos."}
{"text":"It's okay-ish for being in competition with all the other \"Ricos\". They offer a 2 for 1 deal on Mondays.

 I've tried many things in their menu but it's pretty bland, not well seasoned. Really chewy meats, its pretty obvious the person who ow s the place really aims to use low-quality meats (chicken, pork, or beef).

 Its a bit on the low-end scale of fast food with suprisingly higher than expected pricing. Their salsa is super tame and brings zero heat to the taste. That's probably the most disappointing aspect when deciding to indulge here. They skimp the heck out of you if you ask for extra avocado while simultaneously up-charging you for your microaggression of ordering extra.

 In a capitalistic society, you vote with your dollars. I'll take my money elsewhere. 

Did not meet expectations."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is awesome and the portions are large.  The owners are always there when I stop in and eat and they are always happy to see you and appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Bad service I have to order 3 times & I never got my older correctly I asked for a refund and the cashier did not want to give me my money back  I do not recommend this place and I will not be coming back to this place  federico's sucks"}
{"text":"Filiberto's in disguise!

Alright, slightly more generic than Filibertos. The shrimp tostada was too sweet (yeah...sweet!?) for me, like some sort of cheap ceviche loaded on to a corn tortilla. Silly me wasn't expecting it to be a cold meal, but whatever, that's my mistake. Also, the carne asada fries are made with crinkle fries that are salted before everything else gets thrown on. It's gross, and their asada tastes like day-old steak soaked in brine.

I've gotta learn how to starve before going on these drunk Mexican food binges. Or just give my leftovers to Cornell."}
{"text":"I always get stoked to see late-night Mexican food that isn't Filiberto's. It's good enough, portions are big, but there's nothing it does particularly well. Tacos are meh. Burritos are so-so. Carne asada fries don't need to have a tub of sour cream. And food eeds spice of some sort, not just salt and 5 little cups of salsa! At least it's clean, and the guac is legit. 

It's far from the most delicious spot in the area, but at 3am it can be trusted. Isn't that what's really important?"}
{"text":"Me & my whole family used to love going here. For the past couple months we have had isssues with our orders and have been VERY dissapointed. Whats going on...new cooks or what? The past 4 times we have ordered Roast beef taquitos and have specifically asked for roast beef. we get home and they are all chicken. This happened 4 times in a row. WTF. finally the 4th time it happened we called them and took them back and was told they dont sell roast beef anymore. Is that true or was it just some lazy excuse given as to why our order was wrong. because if that is the case why werent we told that those 4 times when we were ordering ROAST BEEF tacos? the past times we have orderd carne asada fries the portion seem smaller and the fries seem soggy or not all the way cooked. the food seems carelessly made like they just hurried and threw it together.They have two red sauces and when we ask for the darker red sauce we are given the wrong one every time. They are too lazy to walk to front to go get it. last night we thought we would try it one more time and ordered carne asada fries. The portion was half of what we used to get and yup the fries cold seems not fully cooked and like the cook just was lazy and threw it all together. That was the final straw and we will not be going back there. Very dissapointing because I wanted to use them to cater a birthday party in November but will not be now."}
{"text":"Ha the gringo version off a taco shop down in the southwest side. Everything is a little less greasy, spicy and probably a few cucarachas fewer. Food is decent and will have to do now this is the closest taco shop"}
{"text":"I know all about the e.coli outbreak, I was a victim of it stay farrrrr away from this place. I thought I was going to DIE"}
{"text":"Food was ok not the best tasting Mexican food then again it is a fast food place. I had the carne asada fries, what made it edible for me was that it had sour cream which I like very much. Service was good, they got my order right."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. The first time I came in there I got exceptional service and had no complaints.  I decided I wanted to bring my kids in for a special dinner.  It was a complete disaster!  I ordered carne asada fries for my son, asked for no guac... came with it on anyway.  I asked for 2 plain tacos only cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.  They came out with meat, lettuce, and cheese.  I looked at my receipt and neither the carne asada fries or the tacos were rung up right the way I wanted them ordered.  I also ordered a pint of rice, which apparently the girl missed too.  What super appalled me, and set me off was I was charged for 2 carne asada tacos, THE MOST EXPENSIVE TACOS on the menu. when my vegetarian daughter did not even want meat.  Why would you do that to a client??? A beef taco is .89 less and again, I did not want ANY meat, so why screw your customer over??? Oh, and not only were we charged for the most expensive taco, but also we were charged for cheese!!  Isn't that standard on a taco?????  The manager juat said \"well that is the way my boss said we are to ring up a taco with no meat!  Horrible service. We won't be back. Surprise/Cotton location"}
{"text":"It's goods. Cost a little more then most Mexican fast-food restaurants. Best part for me is the meat isn't burnt and a nice salsa bar."}
{"text":"Well it's pretty much the late night drive thru must grab for the Phoeniz area.. Is it good Mexican food? hmmm.. Will you get the mud Butt the next morning..Probably.. However if you are drunk and it is past midnight in Phoenix you must grab a burrito, Nachos, Carne asada fries everything you get for $10.. eat it and then pass out.. If you are sober I would probably pass."}
{"text":"The guy at the register this morning at 7:01 am was so rude to the man in front of me I could not have believed it if I did not see it for myself...I will never return to this store 
Robert"}
{"text":"Nice little Mexican food shop. I had the carne asada burrito and it was tasty. I didn't find the tortia very good. Otherwise very clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Never a huge fan of Federico's, they just seem to be everywhere and the closest mexican fast food around. I really got to stop going here."}
{"text":"Ok either he people that cook here are idiots or just flat out jerks. Ordered mini tacos with no onions, and what I got was more onions than meat!! One taco was literally 3/4 onions 1/4 meat. It was easier to dump the entire taco and pick out the meat to put back on it than it was to pick the onion out. Second time I've been at this location. The 1st time I ordered the fish taco that was piled mountain high with their miracle-whip-esque special sauce. I think that they try to skip on more expensive ingredients by piling high on the condiment toppers. We won't be back here. 2 strikes is all you get."}
{"text":"Carne asada fries are pretty damn good. No skin on the meat and it's cut to tiny pieces. Extra bite size. Everyone I delt with was extra friendly and polite. I will have to stop by again before I leave Arizona."}
{"text":"Just moved here a week ago and love this place so much! I've all ready come back 3 times!! I can't wait to try their menudo next weekend! So far I have had, the tacos, nachos and enchiladas! All were superb but the nachos really astounded me! So much food!"}
{"text":"Great burritos, fast service and clean looking place... I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Well, they give you a ton of food. Which would be great if it tasted good. But, the chicken fajitas were the absolute worst I've ever had. Beans and rice were blah. Guacamole was runny and flavorless. Even the iced tea tastes terrible."}
{"text":"Ever since writing my first Review and speaking with the manager. They have provided excellent service and since then I have not received meat in my food. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what the low rating is all about for Federico's but after stopping by here for a late night meal I was sold as a return customer.  While making the drive from Phoenix to Los Angeles, I decided to stop off for some gas and a bite to eat.  The surrounding area had only the typical fast food chains available, but I saw Federico's on yelp (of course) which was nearby and still open, so I headed on over.

I love a good Mexican restaurant that delivers authentic tasting food and the items at Federico's did not disappoint!  Not your typical fast food Mexican joint and not your american style organic, health conscious Mexican place either.  You're not coming here for a diet menu!  The restaurant has a basic kitchen and dining area with a lot of options and authentic, extremely flavorful, greasy food.  Be sure to get extra napkins because you will need to clean up often throughout your meal.  That being said, this simple styled restaurant had a large menu and I was hungry.

I ordered a shrimp quesadilla, a chicken burrito, and the chicken flautas, which also included some chips and red and green salsa.  Everything was reasonably priced, but when I got my order I realized that I had way too much food because the portions are HUGE!  However, I did have a few hour drive ahead of me so I had time to enjoy and pace myself.

First off, the chicken burrito had the most flavorful seasoned and marinated chicken that I have ever had.  It was juicy, tender, and mouth watering delicious from beginning to end.  The shrimp quesadilla was loaded with gooey melted cheese and stuffed with shrimp in a crispy toasted tortilla.  Each piece was like eating a slice of deep-dish pizza.  The flautas were crispy and filled with the same delicious chicken as the burrito.  As for the chips, they were crisp, thin, and warm and tasted as if they were freshly made.  The salsas were also very tasty with the perfect balance of heat and loaded with flavor.  I really liked the green salsa because of it's added tartness.

Additionally, the staff was also very pleasant and enthusiastic to serve with a smile.  Overall, I am a huge fan of Federico's and will be stopping here on every trip that I make to and from Phoenix."}
{"text":"It's OK.  I wouldn't go out of my to visit. The  restaurant is very clean and staff very friendly.  I ordered special of the day (carnitas burro). Even with pico and guacamole is very dry."}
{"text":"Dropping my rating. I waited 15 minutes in the drive thru for a carne asada fries BEFORE they even came to the window to get my card, asked my order again, the disappeared for another 5 minutes. Seriously!? There were no cars in front of me and this was 7pm on a Saturday evening. Seriously lost my positive views on this place. I heard employees yelling and screaming for several minutes in the back while I was in the Drive-Thru waiting for my food. I'm not sure what was going on, but they sure we're not making my food."}
{"text":"This place actually has decent fast Mexican food. It's pretty much good for when you need Mexican food in a hurry. It's pretty convenient with a drive thru, and there is a salsa bar if you dine inside. Think like the style food you'd get in a Mexican super market. Why only 3 stars then? Well it's good but not great. It will do when you need some Mexican flavor in a hurry."}
{"text":"First timer here! Went drive thru, the gal taking my order was friendly& was kind enough to offer adding beans to my order of carne asada fries (I guess I sounded disappointed when she said they didn't come with beans lol) By far the best carnes asada fries I've had since moving here to Surprise a little over 2 years ago. Closest I've found to good ol' Cali Mexican! 

Service was fast & food was delicious! I will def be back!!"}
{"text":"We tried the is restaurant when we were new the area and craving Mexican food.  We were in a hurry and wanted something fast since our toddler was sleep deprived an on edge.  I walked through this restaurant's doors with low expectations since it is a fast food place.  The food was average, at best.  It was very greasy and had a lot of over-processed imitation cheese.  I would go back if I were completely out of food and all the other restaurants in the area were out of power.   Let's hope that scenario does not happen!"}
{"text":"The tacos are terrible. The shells are stale and the lack of filling that is put into the tacos makes them more of just a stale shell taco.  Customer service is a nightmare!"}
{"text":"Taco/Burrito Days M-W. $1.25 tacos, $2.50 Burros. Choice of red chicken, ground or shredded beef. 
No flavor (tacos - tried chicken & shredded beef) at all - hot sauce sucks. Burger King is next door. Hope yer in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"Food here is in par with competitors like Los Favorito's and Filiberto's. The enchiladas, breakfast burritos, tostadas and carne asada fries are delicious. This location is convenient as it is right off the 303 at Greenway. Staff here is friendly."}
{"text":"Went there and ordered a burrito asking for no guacamole, get all the way home with my food expected to be right. Take a bite out of my burrito what do I find? Guacamole and I wouldn't even write about this but this is the third time it's happened. save your money. Go somewhere else you'll get better food as well."}
{"text":"I felt like rice & beans so I thought of trying Federico's since we had only had their breakfast burritos before. I went with the Green Chile plate which came with a big flour tortilla. I assumed it was beef but I honestly couldn't tell what kind of meat it was since it was swimming in green chile sauce. It was tasty though. And I really liked the rice & beans. Very filling plate!"}
{"text":"4 star rating is relative to the price.  Cannot beat it. Best food for the money in north Scottsdale.  Highlights include supreme nachos (huge portion -loaded); chile rellenos; machaca; taco salad.  The salsas are good, but I wouldn't call them the best (that distinction goes to Rubios).

Consistently very quick service in store and at  drive thru.

Late night munchies???  Can't do much better than this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!   There super nachos completely fill the to go container they package it in!   They don't skimp on the meat either, and the meat is great not fatty or gristley like some fast food Mexican places I've tried.   The service is always fast and the people who work there are always so sweeeeet!  My number one favorite Mexican food place when we get take out!"}
{"text":"This place has $1.25 tacos mon-wed I only eat shredded beef hard shell tacos and this place has them the cheapest! It might not be great Mexican food to others but I love those tacos and look forward to eating them every week!"}
{"text":"How hard is it to take my order and give me what I ordered? The last three times have been progressively worse. Last time, order just nachos. Pico de Gillo, quac, and sour cream on the side. Get home, no PdG, no quac, no sour cream. Tonight, fish taco plate and nachos (same way as last). Nachos are fine, my fish taco plate magically turned into some sort of squashed enchilada thing in red sauce. HOW DO YOU SCREW THIS UP? I WAS THE ONLY CAR IN THE DRIVE THRU AND YOU REPEATED THE ORDER BACK TO ME. I'm miles away now and can't go back. If I ever do. The food is just OK. It will be a long while before I go back. Even the beans and rice where nearly flavorless."}
{"text":"Customer service was ok. The restaurant was clean. The food... 

My husband ordered a chicken burrito, which was actually pretty good. I ordered a cheese enchilada combo, which complete GARBAGE. Processed cheese that doesn't melt, sauce that taste like pure vinegar and chewy, THICK tortillas. It was horrible. Rice was bland; definitely needs seasoning. Beans were dry. My husband and I also ordered a small side of rolled tacos. Nothing special. More crappy cheese and a skimpy side of guac. 

Fast forward to later that night.... food poisoning. I wouldn't recommend this place AT ALL. It was our first time there, but we won't be back. 

How hard is it to make a cheese enchilada? 2 stars for the burrito & the clean restaurant"}
{"text":"Easy Mexican food...the ceviche is the best...I noticed the prices went up but it's still good fast food"}
{"text":"Reminds me of Filabertos. Tacos area good but they skimp on the meat"}
{"text":"I will start that we have been purchasing food since we got back to Phoenix in 2011

So we picked up 6 tacos last night and I dropped them off to my wife before I went to work the night shift.

I spoke to her and she said advised the meat tasted funny so no one finished diner.

So I went by and mentioned it to have them make it right and I would buy 3 more.

The little guy says \"You should have come in ladt night, there is nothing I can do\"

So I just decided. \"That's cool I'm Done\"

Just be aware 

No matter how many times you buy, if there is a problem you better call or go back that night.

Look this is Arizona

There is more Mexican food places tgat make tacos.

Just PISS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"I'm generally not a fan of these types of places because they tend to be inconsistent with their food. That said, I wanted some food last night and it was late so I decided to try it. Got a chicken burrito, a couple beef tacos and churros. The burrito was very good and pretty big. Out of the two tacos, one was good the other was deep fried so hard that the meat turned crunchy and inedible. The churros were ok for fast food fare. I don't know if I'll be back but I wouldn't mind getting food from there again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times...the service is what caused me to rate it 3 stars...food is traditional Arizona fast Mexican food...not bad, but not the best."}
{"text":"Every time I come here and go thru the drive thru they get something wrong on the order. Missing items, no drink when you already paid for it. PLEASE CHECK YOUR FOOD I usually don't have to do this any place else but Federico's never fails to forget something or get your order wrong even after you specified what you ordered....."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a big fan of poor reviews but the menu has a chicken taco salad. I ordered it and they made it with beef. When i took it back (not one bite out of it) they refused to make another one with chicken or give me a refund. I left hungry and $8 poorer."}
{"text":"Good food but they charged an arm and a leg for guac and sour cream. #dislike. Came on a Monday for $2.50 burritos and $1.25 tacos which was great food"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time tonight... Iv passed this place many times and they always seem really busy. Nice clean little restaurant.. Staff was friendly.. We ordered the Super Nachos ... Definitely a good choice... Lots of meat just like my husband likes. We also ordered 2 soft tacos and 2 hard... Unfortunately when we got home we noticed we did not receive the 2 hard shell tacos.. But the soft shell were good. Had to grab a few Chiro's before we left.. The Oreo was a nice treat at the end of our dinner ...good prices... Everything we received was delicious and fresh... We will return again"}
{"text":"Not being from Phoenix I always want to try different restaurants that are not back home. My experience here was not great. I asked if they can give my corn tortillas nice and crunchy. Instead they gave them to me what they call crunchy but believe me they were not. The huevos ranchero breakfast I ordered looked gross. The eggs were burnt and not only that they cooked them on a flat metal were they probably cook everything else. The steak that I ordered was nice and dry. The server who took our order acted like she didn't speak Spanish so I proceeded to order in English and then she started to speak in Spanish. SMH the server also looked like she hated working at this place. Don't blame her.  Don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place showes favoritism to certain groups of people and I'm assuming they have a secret menu that you can only get if you speak Spanish, when you order the same thing as a guy in front of you but it looks completely different you know there's a problem. Will not come back"}
{"text":"It's average fast food Mexican. It's very similar to the other 'bertos but much more consistent. We get the super nachos and rolled tacos and they're always decent."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and delicious. I had the carne asada quesadilla and it was to die for. 
The place is also spotless as in very clean. The staff is super friendly  and the food comes out in no time. Overall, I am very pleasantly pleased with this chain.
My friend had the three tacos and it was plenty of food for one person. The quesadilla was humongous with plenty to take home and enjoy afterwards."}
{"text":"Carne asada fries 3 o'clock in the morning, what more can I say. I wouldn't come here for dinner but at 3 in the morning its just what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Freaking disgusting! I moved into the area a few months ago and tried this place one late evening and got the asada nachos and it had zero flavor. The meat tasted like it was boiled with zero seasoning. Nasty. So then today, a month later, I decide to give it one more try since I love the convenience of their drive-thru. Well same ending....gross! My son got the rolled tacos with guacamole and the guacamole tasted rancid and old. So after a few bites he threw his meal away. I got the two beef taco meal and again the beef had no flavor. I ate one taco just so I wasn't wasting all of my money and threw the rest away as well. I am praying that my son and I don't get food poisoning tonight. We will never return to eat here. Senor Tacos a few blocks away is soooooo much better."}
{"text":"Great Green Chile Burritos!  I would've given 5 stars but that is waiting for the place who can make green chile burritos like the closed El Taco on 59th/Glendale.  Make sure you get the creamy jalapeño sauce and chips!"}
{"text":"Edith and Jackie are gold! So hospital and sweet, made me feel  welcome, whereas other people were complaining about their \"fast food taking 5 min.\" This Dou knows how to treat customers"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

This place is within walking distance of my house (maybe  1/2 a mile) yet I had never tried it out until this afternoon.  Before living in AZ, I lived in San Diego.  San Diego is THE KING of Taco Shops.  The undisputed champion!  No other city compares.  I have been hesitant to try any Mexican food here in AZ due to being disappointed and not having it live up to SD standards.  A burrito sounded pretty good today and I decided to head on down here and pick up some lunch for the family.   I figured that I would try this place out at some point.  Why not today?  I placed my order for a Combo #2 (Two beef tacos w/rice and beans) for the wife, a Bean and Cheese Burrito for the kid, and a Carne Asada Burrito, a Beef Taco and an order of Chips and Salsa for myself.  Total was just under $24.00.  Not super cheap, but that is comparable to other taco shops for that amount of food.  I brought it home and dug in.  Here is how everything was..............

Carne Asada Burrito-  Surprisingly, pretty damn tasty!  This was a decent sized burrito.  It had a good tortilla with good grill marks, weighed pretty heavy and was stuffed full of carne asada, guacamole and pico de gallo.  The carne asada was seasoned really well and I did not find one trace of gristle!  Score!  This was only my second burrito in the state of AZ and it was better than the other spot by my work.  I would definitely get this again and may branch out to their AZ Burrito ( aka, Arizonas version of the California Burrito).

Beef Taco-  Decent!  It was a bit small and there was hardly any cheese on it but it tasted alright.  The shredded beef was seasoned nicely, the lettuce was crisp and fresh and the tortilla was fried crispy without being too greasy.  It was only $2.00 which isn't bad either.  I would get it again.

Bean and Cheese Burrito-  I only had a piece of this.  My son and wife enjoyed most of it.  It was alright.  It had a decent amount of cheese in it and the refried beans were tasty enough.  

Combo #2-  My wife ate this.  She is pretty picky when it comes to food but she actually enjoyed it.  She said the rice and beans were good and that the tacos were alright (I can confirm since I had one myself).

Chips and Salsa-  Fresh and hot!  The salsa they provide is a really \"dry\" pico de gallo.  It was good as far as tomatoes, cilantro, onions and even jalapenos, but it was dry.  There was not water in this salsa.  It was just ok.  Not sure if I would get them again for the $2.50 price tag.

Overall, this place hit the spot.  It's not replacing Lolitas, Sombreros, or El Portal as one of my new favorites, but it was pretty legit and better than a lot of taco shops I have been to in SD.  That right there is saying something.  If I ever get a taco shop craving, I will definitely come back.  Service was friendly enough, the place was clean and it is really close to my house.  They didn't put any hot sauce in the bag though.  That is the only negative about this spot.  Guess you have to ask for it?  Who knows?  On a positive, they have a 24-7 drive through!  I'm sure I'll be back soon enough."}
{"text":"They charged me 50 cents more to use my credit card without telling me. I asked why did you charged ne 50 cents more? She said is the taxes. I told her you already charged me for taxes. Her manager came and said we charge you 50 cents if you use your card. I told them that is their fee and not mine. I work in banking and that's illegal. The merchant gets charge a fee to use a terminal and accept cards. She didn't say anything. Said well you pay it not us.  Whatever I'm not coming back to this scam. I hope they lose their business because I'm reporting this."}
{"text":"4/5 overall. Wouldn't say it's the best but I had their breakfast burritos and it was decent. I will return and try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Every Sunday - almost without fail.  We love this place.  I lived in San Diego for 9 years and am a huge Roberto's carne asada burrito fan.  Federico's here is absolutely our favorite and is as good.  LOVE IT!!  The staff are so friendly and hard working.  Don't ever change!!  Carne Asada  burritos and their Carne Asada Tacos are highlights for us!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Gave me the opposite of what I requested. I ordered two carne Asada burritos combo. Pico and gauc on side. They gave me no side of rice but two sides of beans, there was pico in both burritos. The person that took my order said she would make sure it's right. And she didn't. Food took a longer than expected and tasted cold. I really don't feel like driving back. I even tipped her as well. I am very disapointed."}
{"text":"On my last trip to Phoenix and heading to the Cardinal game we felt that we needed a hearty breakfast, and the only option that i can see off camelback road was Ihop. And i really was not looking into digging into some pancakes before a football game.

After some driving down camelback we crossed this spot, at first i was a bit taken back by the building, cause it is new, and not a real authentic place for mexican food, but i should have not judged it by where it is located at, i saw a few people inside and as a couple was leaving i asked them if the food was good, i ask only because i am from Los Angeles, and there are only a few places in L.A. that are worth eating at in my area that taste good.

So once we ordered and got our food, i tried their Huevos Rancheros and some Horchata, other friends tried their tacos and burritos and where please too it all fell into place, the food was good and the staff is real nice, the place was clean and they had t.v.'s everywhere to watch the morning games...

Great place to enjoy some food, next time i am in town i will make my way to this place or another Federico's to enjoy some good food.

Thanks for a new spot to eat off camelback and especially that 24 hour option!"}
{"text":"First - excellent fast customer service.  The food is tasty and the price is right for this kind of restaurant.  All those negative reviews. Huh... If you wanted some more hot sauce just ask.  If you want a crispy breakfast burrito ask!   Arleen"}
{"text":"After getting a bunch of people sick I now know why the food tasted old! Just glad I didn't get sick!!!"}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming one of my favorites. North Scottsdale definitely needed a place like this and this is closer to my house than Filiberto's in the Pavillions.

I judge a Mexican restaurant by its carne asada burrito and was not disappointed here.  My son gets the carne asada fries and they always look tasty but I haven't tried them yet.

Excellent consistent food, great specials such $1.99 burritos on Monday and 99 cent tacos on Wed's. they have buy one get one free burrito coupons on their website. Always clean and no complaints about the people behind the register."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here, I got a Burrito with  Chorizo and potatoes, it was nice and big and hot, but when I unwrapped it I could smell that burnt odor. As I began to eat I could taste and see burnt bits in my burrito, yuck! Since I had a tough enough time with the girl ordering my burrito, her english was not too good, I decided to cut my loses and just leave, I will not be back!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to for lunch since it's very close to my place of business. I like that even though it is not considered a fast food establishment they are very quick with getting the orders out to their customers, but sometimes they get the orders out so quick they hand you someone else's order. This can suck when going through the drive through because I get all the way back to work to find out I got the wrong order. Other then that the food is always good and it's a good place to go! Just make sure you get the correct order to the correct person. This has happened to me on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"Most expensive fast food Mexican place. Slowest service ever. No urgency. I will take my $10 and go to a sit down who offers free chips salsa and drink refills.they charge extra for everything. Salsa limes .....I don't think the owners read their reviews. They need to!"}
{"text":"Gotta say this is the worst place, every time I've been there the food is under cooked or they can't get the order right! Just to make things better they keep charging people more for the same nasty under cooked food! Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and will not return."}
{"text":"Thank you to Federico's on Happy Valley and 39th avenue for hosting a Desert Sage PTO fundraising night!  They donated 10% of their total sales ($226) to our school."}
{"text":"Food and dining experience was fine until girl at front decided to mop with way too many chemicals right in the  middle of our meal. Yea kinda ruined our dining experience. I left with a tummy ache and my wife has a headache 
If I eat there again it will be takeout"}
{"text":"How on Earth can one have an Awesome burrito like the El Ray Burrito and only be given 1, yes thats right, 1 teeny tiny thumbnail cup of hot sauce? How? Poor customer service, thats how. I have been to this location many times mainly for the El Ray. Their carne asada burrito is pretty good, not the best but it gets the job done. Their rolled tacos are my kids favorite. As stated previously, customer service is lacking  and it would benefit you that if you do stop by this establishment and want more then a squirt of hot sauce on your food, please check your bag."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's a good thing that this place is so close to our home... we love their cheese enchiladas so we have to have some willpower.. so far the cheese enchiladas are winning"}
{"text":"Came here after a long night at a strip club! Such bomb Mexican food! Good way to end
The night!"}
{"text":"So how I judge a Mexican restaurant is by the bean & cheese burritos they make. The tortillas are awesome here they taste and look homemade! That's a plus, the beans with the cheese are perfect blend of gooey goodness, There's no grease overrun like other places. Now I would have given this place 5 stars but I hate the red sauce, It's burning my mouth at the moment. The red sauce should complement the burrito, this sauce does not. Even tried to cool it down by dumping the green into the red sauce, no dice. Lucky for me the burrito was great without the sauces. Change the red sauce and you will have a winner for sure."}
{"text":"We have gone 3 times, my husband likes fish tacos-I ordered a beef and cheese burrito---twice the burger was burned so bad I thought someone was playing a joke. The tortilla was dry and breaking apart.  The home made salsa is good."}
{"text":"The food here is authentic and very good! They have great refried beans (if you're a bean person lol). But overall I love coming here for the wide variety of food options they have!"}
{"text":"Unless you live in the area, this particular location should be avoided. 

About a year and a half ago, I came to this establishment around 2 a.m. I had just finished ordering at the menu and was getting ready to pull around the corner to the window. I had glanced over at 2 men in dark clothing at the nearby Circle K and saw that one of them was holding what looked to be a gun. I didn't stare directly at them so as to not provoke them to shoot me. I didn't want to die and be remembered for going to Federico's at 2 a.m. for a breakfast burrito. I pulled up to the window, never looking at them. I was frightened for my life and eventually sped off. They looked like they were just about ready to rob Circle K up until the point that I pulled around the corner. Little did I know, right when I pulled up at the window, they walked off. 

I stopped going there for a very long time. Before that, I had been going there almost everyday. It's close to where I live and their guacamole is far better than Filiberto's. I was at a Subway restaurant and one of the cashiers from Federico's recognized me. I told her what happened and my story came to her with no shock. She told me people walk in there with guns all the time. I also know personally just by passing by the place on my way home from work that there's a lot that goes on at that Circle K for cop cars to be there quite often.

Anyway, fast-forward to now and I have returned in search of non-processed, wholesome food. The friendly cashiers and other staff that had been working there are now gone. They've been replaced by this really gorgeous cashier who'll probably be the prettiest girl you've ever seen in real life, with an extremely sour attitude. If you pay with cash, you'll probably have your change thrown at you. If you pay with a card, you'll have to sign the statement and I don't think it flatters her if you write 0 as the tip. \"No, I don't want some of your spit in my Carne Asada Burrito.\" If you're coming to eat here, make sure you have enough ones, fives, pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters to make exact change. 

If you pull up on a payday Friday and there just happens to be 10 people in line at the drive-thru and one person in line at the counter, do not opt to go inside. I did that a couple of times and always saw the last car in line leave before me. It became apparent that if you choose to sit inside that your order will be placed on the back burner. I swear I must have been sitting there for just under half an hour. They have two different television sets going, each at an audible level, on two different channels. Their interior is clean and if you plan to use the bathroom, postpone your plans until you get home. I've never gone in the actual restroom, but you need a key, which you get at the food counter, which is attached to a large rod, which probably isn't clean. If in a recent study that showed 82% of shopping carts tested positive for fecal matter on the area most in contact with human hands, then the probability of there being the same bacteria present on this thing would be 100.00%."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss sometimes with their customer service. But I do like the food. However, I had to review today because I won't be coming back. With my order, I was given 2 small cups of green salsa and once I got home to eat my burrito I opened one up and not only did it look bad but it smelled awful. They seriously gave me salsa that had gone bad! the other one looked alright but I refuse to eat either to risk the chance of getting sick. I already want to puke from the smell of it. Who does that!!!!!???? Ugh."}
{"text":"Just now: Went inside to make a to go order of a bacon, egg and cheese burrito. As I stood waiting for my order, I noticed that the cook, right before pulling my order of the grill he dipped in spatula into the fryer grease and doused my food with fryer grease! 
I asked the purpose and was told that it helps cook the food faster and that the food doesn't stick to the grill. I told them I couldn't eat the burrito and walked out. 

This will be last visit to any of thethis establishment or any of the 'to's restaurants!!"}
{"text":"2 times in 3 weeks we've had to go back and get the rest of the food we've ordered in the drive-thru.  Glad we only live 4 miles away.  Be sure to check your order before you roll out.  Last time I'll come back here because there was no apology, no responsibility taken, and the food waited at the window 25 min and there was no offer to remake or even heat it up.   Poor service multiple times in a short period of time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for \"the best Arizona burrito in Phoenix\"...this is the place to go.  This is the best Mexican drive-thru driving.  Very close drive from the Sheraton, the University of Arizona downtown campus, and close to Chase Field to get yourself a quality Arizona burrito before the game.

I also had the Mar y Tierra quesadilla, it wasn't my cup of tea.  So if you want to get something else, this isn't the review you should read...but if you're indecisive, order yourself an Arizona Burrito."}
{"text":"we were ticket 3154 we walked into a place with a sewer smell and thought we would stil order. we ordered the female clear was talking loud to the men that was there about drinking and being hung over in spanish bot bieng aware we new what they were talking about and very loudly. as we waited a younger gentleman in his late teens was waiting for over 7 minutes while the staff was talking and she kept looking over at him with no communication our order was ready as we thought but the famale clerk got our food and roughly put in on the counter and walked away while she was still talking to the staff about personal and partying issues, as we left the man was still waiting. we got home to find our burritos soaked and drenched in grease and could not even eat it. now we are sitting here and with an upset stomach and nauseaed from the food we ate. a waste of time and money now we are hoping we dont have food poisoning! we have pictures posted on our facebook of the experience.

{"text":"Since this is around the corner from my house I wanted to try it out. Ordered a bean burrito, nothing special, well that is exactly what I got. Canned refried beans not hot and yellow cheese. Taco Bell has better burritos!"}
{"text":"Horrible Mexican food. NOT authentic or traditional at all. The food taste like it's out of a can or box and then mircowaved.  It's equal Taco Bell fast food. The restaurant even smells funny, it doesn't smell like food is being cooked all day."}
{"text":"OK, if it wasn't 11:09 p.m., maybe Federico's would only get four stars, but when you're in need of Mexican and everywhere else is closed or far away, five stars is the least Federico's deserves.

Probably won't visit very often, but it's definitely on my list of \"go to\" places late at night."}
{"text":"The girl that was in the drive through tonight was so rude and leaning over the drive through window, having a private conversation with her friend for 10 minutes. Then we asked for green sauce and to have my burrito made into a plate. She charged us for a pint without even telling me she was doing so. I did not even get any sauce, forks or napkins. Then we go back and the gentlemen in the winodw was also rude. I've had the owrst day and this was the cherry on the pie. All I wanted to do was eat and go to bed. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Pretty good Sonoran style Mexican food right up the street and a great price."}
{"text":"Ya know it's okay. And it's better than Filberto's. I wish these places had real guacamole and not that runny stuff."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited in drive through for over 15 minutes this morning. The car ahead of us had a single container of food.  There is no reason that the order taker could not have said \"We are backed up\". I should know better.  One morning about 6:30 I ordered a bean burrito. It took them 10 minutes to tell me they had no beans. No beans at a Mexican food restaurant? Stay away!!  They don't care about their customers."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good breakfast burrito place that's close! Just had the sausage and egg- yum!"}
{"text":"Fine, fine Mexican food. You won't write home to mamacita about this place but you won't leave hungry, either. It's your typical Mexican fast food joint with greasy, cheesy options and watery salsas."}
{"text":"Great food and prices. Far better pricing and speed than down the street at La Familia which is basically now a loud obnoxious bar, with Mexican food on the side sadly.

Federico's has a lot of daily specials. Check their website for coupons, specials, menus, prices.  Monday AND Tuesday is 99 Cent Tacos (reg. $2.09+) and $1.99 burritos (reg. $3).  

they have a nice little salsa bar, but also have red radishes sliced  up, jalepenos, onions/jalepenos julienned.  And they don't ration your salsa or charge extra for to go salsa like La Familia does.

I often find that going inside is quicker than the drive through.  Not sure why. I think everything is made to order, so if someone gets something unusual in the drive thru, it holds up the line.

I wish this was close to my work, I'd go there a lot more. Great combo specials, and very good prices. I like the atmosphere inside, TV in there."}
{"text":"Monday and Tuesday, full sized tacos $1.50 each (ground beef, chicken, shredded beef), and burritos $2.50 (green chile, ground beef, chicken).  Always delicious. Jalepenos are not overly hot for me, so I love them since i can taste the jalepeno flavor and my meal as I eat them together and my mouth is not on fire for a long time afterwards.  Ladies always very nice at register."}
{"text":"Do your beans have lard in them?  \"Uh, I don't know.\"  (5-10 seconds go by with us awkwardly staring at each other) and I realize I'm going to have to inquire further.  Response included rolling the eyes, a shoulder shrug, and angrily muttering something in Spanish to the folks in the back.  Consensus is they don't really think so.  But, do we really have to endure people like this?  In customer service retail, you don't just stare back at someone and tell them you don't know.  /sigh

Location is easy to find in the Safeway parking lot.  The drive through is right by the two gigantic trash bins in the eastern part of the parking lot (the trash bins indicate they are for tenant's use only).

Food was similar to gringo-like Mexican chains such as Chevy's and On The Border, but prices were much better.  Rice and beans were plain, and beans portion was quite small with the combo (no more than 4-5 teaspoons).  Cheese Quesadilla was dry.  If you're dining in, get something to eat with your hands because the plastic silverware is among the most flexy and fragile I've seen.  They just don't hold up to a Chile Relleno.

Hot sauce served in ketchup squirt bottles.  It's also more of a \"medium sauce\" though."}
{"text":"Food poisoning my first time (and now last) eating here. Stay away if you value your health! One star only because yelp doesn't allow you zero."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican fast food/ drive thru!! Their food is always delicious and not too greasy. I expect a fresh taco shell to have a lil grease, come on now. I also like their ceviche bowl and especially how they pack it to go- they separate the ceviche & it's juices from the chips so it isn't soggy by the time you get home. Plus they throw in lotsa lemon and Tapatio packets. Bomb!! 
Their Chile Verde (pork in green sauce) is heavenly. They are heavy on the guacamole, woohoo! Bonus points for being open 24/7."}
{"text":"I just spent $12.00 dollars on a burrito, and an order of French fries that came in a moldy styrofoam box. This is unacceptable. I should've checked my food when I drove out of the drive through, but who expects mold to be on the box that your French fries comes in. I hope this can be fixed or at least give me a refund. 

**** UPDATE Yo Federico's how you gonna leave me hanging like this, we used to be friends, I'm still
Waiting for my refund"}
{"text":"Horrible. I only go in for tacos. But no more. They just have no flavor. And .99 cent Monday, tues. and wed. Are gone, witch makes them even less worth spending money on them. The last time I went was the last time for me. I ordered 3 tacos and asked for and paid for extra cheese. When I got home and opened them up, I realized I was ripped off. At best  a pinch of cheese. Just not worth the money or hassle."}
{"text":"The customer service is fake as hell. She's smiles at your face when the cashier knows she's wrong and if your ordering through the mic she always gets my order wrong, this time was the last time I'm coming here because I have to deal with the same shit and same shit customer service. After she gave me my food I had a question to ask and she knew I wasn't done so instead she just slammed the little window and I kept the line holding for about 5 min trying to get her attention but nothing. I left and ill never come back here again until I don't see her anymore. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"If you like tons of grease dripping onto your tray than this is the place. Decided to try it again but this was the worst Mexican food ever. The grease is so bad it just lays in your stomach.

Will never go to this place again!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Federico's.  We were in the shopping center for something else but got a whiff of Mexican and decided to go in for a try.  Hadn't heard of this place before.  

We ordered a quesadilla and a tostada & enchilada combo.

Food was meh really.  Had to pay extra for pico de gallo, salsa bar was empty, no chips provided.  Wife's tostada was skimpy on cheese and the quesadilla should've been more I'd think for paying almost $4 for it.

There are a lot of Mexican food options in the valley, this one could definitely step things up in my opinion.  We decided we won't be back here when we could go somewhere else that has better flavor and prices for the portions."}
{"text":"this place is great !! i love the food ,service is good & its in a great part of town.. breakfast burritos are excellent!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times. My boyfriend loves this place. I like it because this is the closest Mexican food that I have found near by, that is close to our home town Santa Maria CA. Every time I go I feel like it's over priced, but I don't mined because it's always good. But tonight I got a \"BLACK HAIR\" in many Quesadilla. Not cool for how much I pay, won't go back."}
{"text":"Extremely Rude Order taker

Charged my card 200.47 for a *uckin burrito

Didn't want to give me my food because my card declined...but managed to clear my entire account and put me in negative.

Did not want to give me my food, wanted me to leave with a receipt and call my bank. 

Do not go here, service is ridiculous, nothing but idiots"}
{"text":"Just left this federicos.  I had a Texas burrito and hubby had the Rey burrito. Both were above average, and the restaurant was very clean. No flies on window sills and floor was freshly mopped. Staff were courteous and helpful.

Will come again."}
{"text":"Food is good SOMETIMES. Not really worth the wait (once waited 15 minutes for a burrito) it is open 24 hours which is great, however if you plan on ordering at or past midnight expect your food to be cold. Customer service is also not their strong suit."}
{"text":"Mondays $2.99 Burritos , Tuesdays are $1.50 tacos.

Not fancy mexican food, but for the money, quick and quality it is difficult to beat. 

I like the breakfast burritos, Egg Sausage and Potatoes or the Chorizo, the Green Chili Burro and their tacos are very good for the cost you pay.

Nice location and restaurant, but have always gone through the drive thru.

Recommend going on Monday and Tuesday for the specials and stocking up. Great tortillas."}
{"text":"How can you beat tacos for $1.25 and burritos for $2.50 Monday thru Wednesday. The tacos that I get are the shredded beef along with the shredded beef burrito or a green chili burro. 

The small street tacos are pretty good also and there is a special 5 for $5,99. 

I love the breakfast burritos here,  generally get the country burrito with potatoes or the the chorizo burrito which is my favorite but unfortunately my stomach doesn't do well.

If you want inexpensive quick good Mexican  food you can't beat the price.

Is there better Mexican food that this probably but for something quick to you can't beat the price.

Will keep coming here again and again."}
