{"text":"I went there for dinner the other night, everyone in the restaurant was super friendly and the food was delicious. They have all sorts of menu items for sushi lovers and non sushi lovers alike."}
{"text":"We visited Oishii sushi a few days ago with a Groupon voucher that we bought previously. Though it said that we had to present the voucher by paper (printout), upon calling and asking, they said that it is okay to bring it on your mobile phone. 
When we arrived, we were quickly seated and we told them that we had the Groupon voucher. After checking/validating the voucher, we were brought menus and the waiter explained how the Groupon prix fixe worked. 
We got: soup to start (miso/seafood miso) for 2, an appetizer of our choice up to $8 (more expensive ones were available for an extra surcharge), a special maki to share, and chef's special plate of 25 pieces of sushi. 
We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the maki. I love maki, and I was extremely satisfied with my chef's plate which included 5 types of maki with 4 pieces of sushi. Though the quality of the fish used wasn't the most fresh, their maki and sushi selection was great and I'd definitely return again for another great dining experience with or without my Groupon voucher. I'd recommend this place for those who are looking for some good Japanese sushi in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Very excited to have this as my neighbourhood sushi joint. Solid place for when you're after delicious raw fish, ethereal tempura, and some warm sake to make you extra happy."}
{"text":"My first visit to Oishii was nothing to write home about. The Sushi was delicious, but the service was really terrible and we vowed not to return to dine in.

Two night ago on my way home from work I decided to try their take out. I was incredibly surprised, the food was prompt, packaged the best I have ever seen, and it was again, delicious. 

If you want excellent sushi, head here. Just don't expect much from the wait staff. I know mistakes happen, but our vegetable tempura order came out half empty, then was remedied with a fish order (not acceptable), we finally got the rest of our tempura 15 minutes after we had finished our rolls, and then it took over half an hour to get our bill and pay. No apologies anywhere to be found. 

When trying a new place for the first time, it's hard not to consider service as a major selling point."}
{"text":"Price was very good. Went for lunch and had all you can eat plus one margarita, $41 for two of us. Miso soup was good, sushi options aren't very wide but the quality was great. The sushi cones were very basic, not much in them but again, good. 
Server was courteous, came when needed and didn't hover. Great atmosphere and very open and inviting. I found my new sushi home :)"}
{"text":"Food was customer service was off the chains, and the atmosphere has a nice vibe there as well.

The food came really fast, and the decoration are very nice as well. Love the place.

The service here is also exceptional! My order had a small mix up, but it was quickly corrected. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here, and I will definitely try to go back more often."}
{"text":"Everything you want in a dining experience.  Friendly service and great food.  Our party of 8 thoroughly enjoyed the all you can eat sushi.  Oishii's is well worth trip into Riverbend.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"food is amazing for all you can eat! I haven't had better Japanese food at a normal restaurant. the interior is beautiful and the staff is friendly the sushi is top notch."}
{"text":"J'ai essayé ce Resto pour la première fois ce week-end. Je n'ai pas été déçue!
Tout était délicieux.. Les sushis sont super bon, le poisson bien frais! À essayer!!"}
{"text":"They just raised the all you can eat price from 33 dollars to 36 dollars
Yesterday, I went and i had the worst server ever. We were a table of 6 , and the service was terrible. I think he did not care about us because he knew gratuity was already going to be included. He kept forgetting about us and it wasn't all that busy. He checked up on us once and we kept asking him for our condiments when we wrote everything down on the paper. For dessert, I wrote down two chocolates ice cream down and he gave me vanilla instead. When I told him I wanted chocolate, he got mad at me and told me I should write more clear. His service is terrible, i just find that the service has gone done immensely. Would rather spend my money elsewhere with better service."}
{"text":"Best price for lunch! 17.99 for all you can eat! How can you beat that? Honestly better than kinjo if you ask me! So much variety and such friendly staff. Jojo was very sweet and accommodating. Will always come back here when I'm craving sushi :)"}
{"text":"We purchased a group-buy coupon for Oishii Sushi, but when we wanted to make a reservation, their phone went unanswered and their mailbox was full.  We sent an email asking if they were still open, but received no reply.  Their website did not indicate anything out of the ordinary, and so we figured that they were bad with phones and drove down hoping to just walk in.  The place is completely shut down, with the windows papered over.  A sign on the window said \"CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS - REOPENING FEBRUARY 2012\" ... but it was already March.  How can you close your restaurant without indicating as much in your phone message and website!?  Unbelievable.

*** UPDATE ***

Oishi Sushi has re-opened, and we were finally able to redeem our coupons.  The food was decent, but over-priced.  The only dish that stood out was the grilled tuna steak salad, which was really good.  The service was, however, atrocious.

First, it was slow, despite the fact that there were a lot of servers on the floor. Second, one of our servers had to return to the table twice to confirm our order because she forgot.  Third, when we tried to pay, our server charged us the tax TWICE (which was over ten dollars), and when I respectfully asked her what the charge was, she argued with me for a ridiculously long time that the tax had not actually been charged twice, huffing and puffing, rolling her eyes and sighing exasperatedly as if I were the problem and basically and making a huge scene before finally (loudly) calling her manager over.  The manager, at least, immediately saw that the tax had been charged twice (it was an obvious mistake), apologized, and corrected the bill.  But all in all, it was a really uncomfortable exchange.  I get the feeling that this restaurant just does not give two flips about its patrons."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite all you can eat sushi buffet. I absolutely enjoy all of the variety of food they offer compared with other all you can eat that only contains sushi rolls etc. Its quite a good deal considering the fact that the reg. dinner menu is around $27 but the deluxe chef menu is around $32 (but includes all the tatakis for those who are fans!). It can get quite busy during the dinner peak hours especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Really surprised this restaurant has received a handful of bad reviews. I have eaten here several times and loved it each time. The service is excellent, the staff is very friendly & hospitable- they even made us a roll that was not on the menu! The decor is very nice, especially during the warmer months when all the front  panels are removed. I would recommend trying the Rainbow Specialty roll & the roll with Basil. All the rolls are presented nicely and tasted very fresh. Prices are extremely reasonable, around $1-$1.50/ piece.Lot of variety in cocktails, a friend ordered the Ginger martini and really enjoyed it . For dessert, make sure to try the Green Tea ice cream! Overall, very highly recommended. 

Bon appetit :)"}
{"text":"Not good for groups.
 We came here tonight for my birthday dinner a group of 11 (booked a week in advance to make sure table was ready). Our first round arrived fast, however when we ordered a second the servers just placed all our orders onto one dish ( example 8 people ordered crab legs and was all put onto one plate at the far end of the table) when you know its a large group and several people give pages they need to be split up. This happened with the sushi also. 
My biggest issue was my one friend only eats cooked food, they have a great list for her to eat from... but again all put at the end of table, she literally ate 6 bites of cooked items, because again.. food was placed at the end of table and server never brought us food to the other end, and most cooked items were never seen at the table. What is the point of having a bunch of different order sheets if you cant even get what you want??
The blended drinks took 20 minutes to get, not joking from when ordered. 
So 20 minute drink and not getting food and her bill still was about $50 ( including tip for large group which was already added). 
We spoke to the manager who was working. And he said theres nothing he could do.. not even discount her meal, not good customer services at all. 
We will not be coming back simply because they didnt even try to make the situation better at all."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. The food was pretty good for all you can eat, but nothing was outstanding.  The lady did not refill our empty glasses of water when she picked up our orders, instead, we had to ask her to do so. In order for us to have our orders put in, we had to wait for when we saw her so that we could waive her down to give it to her. She also did not ask how the food was at all. When it came time to pay, no tip was given since the lady did not deserve it, as she did not fulfill her role as a server. THE WORST PART.. after we paid, she looked at the receipt and said that we should be tipping her. I find that absolutely RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL. It was only a table of 3, so tipping is only voluntary. She was being so desperate for tips saying she is a university student and that she should get tipped. I understand why she would want tips, but she has no right to be begging for tips. I'm all about tipping servers, but this is a rare occasion where I didn't, and this lady had the audacity to basically tell us to tip her? Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great experience! Food is fresh and staff are great. I am hoping this place is here for a long time. Everything is made to order and beautifully presented. A better option than all you can eat Chinese and better sushi than Kinjo."}
{"text":"oyster was great, lamb skewers are awesome. the lobster roll was mediocre. surf clams sashimi was fresh. definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE. 
I've been to oishii a handful of times and I was absolutely in love. The food was great despite the crappy service but with AYCE you can't really expect great service when it's so busy. This time around I went with new friends, raving about how good it was. LITTLE DID I KNOW I would NEVER be coming back again. We placed our first order and off the bat I find a hair in my soup. The waiter took it back to the kitchen and replaced it for me which I was fine with because mistakes do happen. You thought I was finished? WELL I'M NOT. We ordered their sushi and inside was ANOTHER HAIR. This time we complained again and was a little more irritated but the manager offered kind words and gave us drinks on the house. We finally brushed off the issues and tried to continue with our meal UNTIL WE FOUND ONE MORE GOD DAMN HAIR IN THE RICE. At this point we were so fed up and just wanted to leave so we complained once again and this time the manger had little to nothing to say but just to grab our dish and reply with \"oh ok\" and leave. We were so disappointed and honestly angry at this point after 3 HAIRS, free drinks didn't even seem like enough to compensate for our meal and our horrible service. Did I mention it took them almost 20 minutes for a glass of water?? We go up to pay explaining how we feel like we need to be compensated for our meal and free drinks didn't help because there was six of us and we got two pops and two teas (total of $8.50) which is nothing off the bill for something so disgusting in our food not to mention some of the cooks didn't even have on hair nets. He told us there was little he could do but offer us 10% off the bill with drinks included OR he could charge us the bill with no drinks included but no 10% discount. Either way both deals were so shitty. Also, we were a party of 6 so they added on a 15% gratuity which infuriated me for hair in our food and crappy service. Needless to say, I will never be coming back again and they should've had better customer service and offered more to compensate. Total trash."}
{"text":"J'ai essayé avec quelques amis et ... Bon ... Ben ... Veni vidi vici, quoi ! Au moins, je l'aurais essayé !
L'une des serveuses, la jeune, est particulièrement agréable, pas la plus âgée ... Mais la musique d'ambiance, de style rétro, était agréable ainsi que le décor.
Il y a d'autres sushi places à Montreal, quoi !"}
{"text":"I am a regular customer at Oishi Sushi and this is one of my most favorite sushi places in Montreal. The food is always fresh and amazing. The appetizers are so yummy, particularly the scallops and the tuna. I think I have tried each single dish on the menu. My favorite sushi on the menu is the Rainbow. But really everything is great. 

The customer service is also very good! And the manager is super sweet and pleasant lady!"}
{"text":"YES! A freaking sushi place right down the street and it isn't run by white people. Hahaha ...honestly when we walked in and were the only people speaking English I knew that we scored. Not to mention the entire staff welcomes every customer once they walk into the store.  This is something they do at every restaurant in Japan and for me it demonstrates authenticity.  

We went for the AYCE and it was awesome.  They even gave us 2 orders of snow crab from the 'deluxe' menu.  Basically there are 3 menus...the AYCE menu for $27.99, the deluxe AYCE menu with a few extra delicacies (like snow crab and scallops) for $32.99 or the A La Carte menu that essentially has everything individually priced.  Some people complain that the service is slow but in most places in Asia dinner is at least a 4 hour feast of multiple courses...so I think they are kind of adopting this method.  

Either way, I'll definitely be heading here again...it'll be tougher to drive over to Globefish in my opinion."}
{"text":"I got a Groupon deal on this cause it's a little far and it's my first time trying this place out. The Groupon specifically indicated it can't be applied on all you can eat, which is fair. However, when we arrived, we were told it also cannot be applied to bento boxes. It was not mentioned anywhere, not even on the fine print. We ended up having to order individual orders of appetizers and rolls. Including the money spent on the Groupon purchase, we spent a total of ~$55 (and that's with a Groupon deal!) Food was good, but definitely not worth that kind of money for lunch. What a rip off!"}
{"text":"I went there 2 times for dinner in the last month. I enjoyed them both.  First,  I got their sashimi plate, good amount of rice but not in excess, vegetable as decoration and 15 pieces of fresh fish. The white tuna pieces (albacore?)  were melting in the mouth! Second time I got the sushi plate.  Again, really good.  Those two plates in table d'hôte meal are a great mix.   For parking (a problem in that neighbourhood), I would recommend Jeanne Mance or Esplanade."}
{"text":"Overall everything is good and tasty but when it comes to snow crab it only took more than one and half hour to get on the table which makes you don't have patience or time to order again."}
{"text":"So far, so good! This is my first time here and I'm already pretty blown away with the quality and variety of food here, especially for an all-you-can-eat experience. 

We went with the deluxe menu, which included beef/tuna/salmon tataki options, as well as unlimited snow crab (super fresh). It also includes 2 pieces of premium fish free for each guest, and that includes some Japanese fish. Overall, I was really impressed with the food!! 

The only thing I would mention is that the portions are confusing. Sometimes it was literally one tiny piece, but another items came with many pieces. So I felt wasteful ordering something but only being served one piece with a ton of pretty garnish! 

*Be careful with the teapots. They spill easily!! Haha."}
{"text":"Food is good, so far only tried ramen and sashimi. Sashimi is really delicious. Service is slow though, especially during lunch hour."}
{"text":"I was a little reluctant to try this all you can eat sushi place at first because I read some bad reviews but I was very impressed with this place. We went before 5pm so it wasn't too busy so the food came very quick and the service was very good. Sushi and rolls were very delicious. I would go back again."}
{"text":"A nice sushi restaurant on Bernard in Mile-End. They have quite a few innovative choices, if you are looking for something more innovative and less authentic. The prices are a little high and the habit of cutting rolls in 5 make sharing a little more difficult. Good atmosphere, good heating, even near the windows. Service are smooth and well done. Parking in the neighbourhood is difficult."}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options!! All you can eat basic menu has such a wide variety of options. The atmosphere is great, clean and modern! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I don't believe in ratings. Just go or not. This one is NOT.

Sushi are cheap and too much cucumber.

Do not go here."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and I'm really impressed. You get a lot for the price, especially with the platters, and the rolls are well made. I order with skip, and the presentation is amazing considering it's being packed to go. 

I am reaallly happy to have a place like this so close to home!"}
{"text":"I'm a true sushi connaseur having travelled to Japan a few times or eaten in little Tokyo in LA. The sushi here is comparable tuna not pink (signs of frozen)  and very tasty. Just the right taste in the rice no sugar taste. If you like authentic this place is as close as you'll get in Montreal."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here this evening for a treat - she loves Sushi! My order arrived first and since she was hungry and waiting.. i gave her some of mine. After mine was finished  - 20 minutes or so later.. we continued to wait for her roll.. Then my 14 year old daughter flagged down a server since ours was no where to be seen. About 5 minutes or so later she got her order and hungrily gobbled it all down. It seems her order was forgotten. Next time we will do a lunch at Big Catch (Market on Mcleod) for a reasonably priced, reliable and quality Sushi meal. I am proud of how my daughter handled this. The food was good, but the neglectful service ruined our intention of having a nice meal out."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch yesterday, but didn't have the AYCE. Instead I opted for one of the Bento boxes. I ordered the bento box with two choices, my friend the one with three choices. The meal also comes with miso soup. The two dishes sides I ordered were the Teriyaki beef, and the chicken karaage. The box was tasty, and if I had to say anything negative about it. The beef was luke warm. I would even have to say it bordered on the cooler side of luke as well.
On this day, it was a Wednesday they had a special if you ordered Japanese beer. I ordered the Asahi beer (Bottle). and the special this day was  that you get two oysters with it.  I have to say that they were pretty darn tasty oysters. They were served cold, and with a sweeter ponzu type sauce.
The people around us look like they ordered the AYCE, and judging by the size and look of the rolls I think I'll be back to try it.

This restaurant was the former neighborhood pub. 
I also wanted to add that upon entering the restaurant it seemed like it wasn't busy. That's because everyone was seated behind a wall by the main entrance to the left. This area was completely full. It's a big space, you can't really judge from the outside.

I'll be back forsure."}
{"text":"I just came here to try their all you can eat sushi, the food was nice and the location is clean but the downside is the waiting time for the orders.. and aside from the long waiting time, the servers keep on sending us food that we didnt order.. plus the male manager i forgot to get his name was very rude when explaining stuff to us.. i would prefer Kinjo Sushi or Sushi Ichiban for the quality of service.."}
{"text":"I have been to Oishii on numerous occasions and have always had excellent service and the food's amazing!
I don't generally post reviews, but the service we received this time was absolutely ridiculous. To start off, our server Kim was really rude and never greeted us. We ordered tea for a table of 4, and apparently it was so \"busy\" our tea came in a plastic water jug, and of course the hot tea became luke warm after 5-10 minutes. She never bothered asking us how the food was or tried to make any conversation with us whatsoever. Then we noticed other tables received teapots after we were seated. We were holding the order sheet up to discuss our next order and she just walks by and grabs the sheet out of our hands we almost got a papercut! 
We also felt like we were \"working\" because when the food came, the runners would hand us the food and not bother putting it on the table. (we'll help of course if the table was full and we had to rearrange, but our table was empty). When it came to the bill, we wanted to pay with the tip amount and not the percentage option. So we asked because the \"other option\" button didn't allow an amount either. She abruptly takes the machine away from my hands and said \"you can just tell me next time\" (like we're suppose to know).  
I'm thinking, no sorry there will be no next time if you keep treating your customers like that."}
{"text":"I love the eat all u can menu.compared to other eat all u can japanese places,the quality of food is really good.servers are uber friendly.i love the sunomono salad( the plating was cute) .i like that they take time to plate the food nicely despite the place being eat all you can.i recommend this place to sushi lovers"}
{"text":"Kind of like Japanese tapas (Izakaya?), you can get all sorts of interesting small dishes, like orange salmon canapes, oishii lobster (our favorite!) - including strawberries and served with shrimp chips, and many others.

In a city with a bad reputation for sushi, Oishii manages to put together a very interesting and solid selection of quality dishes, and is still reasonably priced, at least in 2010.  Definitely a neighborhood go-to spot, and at the same time unique enough to please visitors to the city too.  Definitely to be recommended.

Great for groups too, as they have a decent amount of space, and I think they have 1/2 price cocktails on Thursdays."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times but recently I invited a set of friends and it was their first time. I have to say I was a bit humiliated thanks to the lovely but condescending staff/server. There were five of us who came. A friend was running late so the rest of us decided to order lots of food. When the server came to see our orders she felt very unsure and warned us that \"It is a little bit too much for a group of 5.\" She then went on to say that \"we charge for left over food\" as if we didn't know that as we entered...

When the server said that all of our eyes widened. Come again? We all found it insulting for the server to say that it is \"a bit too much\" considering it is an ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT place. We already know the rules very well. We're not naive about this kind of service but who is she too judge that it was \"a bit too much?\" My friends and I fasted since the night before and we knew what we were doing.

Nevertheless, we felt challenged so we took her warning seriously. Two rounds of copious amount of food later, there was nothing left except the plates. If only we could eat the plates to further prove to that server that she was dead wrong! It was no wonder she was quiet when we asked for the bill. She could not even look us in the eye! How's that for a little bit too much?

But seriously... Please don't tell you're customers that their orders are too much. There is a reason why they are eating at an AYCE place - they are probably hungry af or starved themselves for a day or two!"}
{"text":"came in on the recommendation of our Helm bartender -- so glad we did! fresh sushi and options for the non-sushi eaters. We enjoyed the California roll, the rainbow roll, and the chicken curry! All very fresh and delicious! Great option for Japanese food in Mile End. the picture represents the remnants because we were VERY hungry"}
{"text":"Food was yummy. Super busy therefore no pressure to leave after 2 hours as we hadn't even finished round 2 yet! Favourite was Alberta Rolls and shrimp with mayo. Very fresh. Loved our attentive waiter. Could have really done without the \"running around\" hostess. Not conducive to relaxation as a result. Will come back though!"}
{"text":"Left a few pieces. I mean a few pieces of tuna sashimi and the Owner was there to charge that left over. Always go to this place over 10 times never happened. Don't know what's the matter with him but never coming back again."}
{"text":"First off - good food, Service - lacking 

This was a hard one to rate for me, the food was actually quite good and the interior is finished very nicely for an AYCE sushi place. The only things that apparently wasn't great was the tempura, a bit soft and the wontons were very fried (deep fried). 

We had quite a bit of different options, sashimi, rolls, comes, Yaki grill and apps. 

The mango dragon and house special rolls were great and would get them again. 

The issue with the service was this: we sat at the entrance to the elevated table section, literally the first table just by the order station. We had dish runners coming to pickup plates we finished but our order sat on the end of the table as the waiter ran by multiple times (nearly a dozen trips past). This went on for about 20 minutes until I had to chase him down to give him the order. 

To be entirely fair, they did get slammed right near the end of our meal but sitting at what is probably one of the highest traffic areas directly behind the manager/host you would think someone would notice and have helped the poor waiter out. 

Again, food was good, atmosphere was clean / bright / inviting, service could use some improvement (maybe have dish runners grabbing orders, manager picking up slack when they're slammed, something...). 

May or may not be back...maybe on a night were not starving or in a hurry."}
{"text":"Me lady and I went here for my 40th. First off; deceptive outside-to-inside appearance. Strip mall corner sushi restaurant...that's the descript for a 6 seater, dirty table top kinda place. Not here! This place was Huge and beautifully well designed, although the room is almost entirely open so if their's 50 people in their, it gets real loud with the chatter. 

That being said, the sushi was really good. They have 2 \"all you can eat\" options. We deiced on the first one. Great selection and quality. Since my lady keeps reminding me that I'm a sushi roll man and not a true sushi fan (raw fish on a bed of rice) as she is, I enjoyed mocking her endlessly when she ate all my dragon rolls and started to attack my second order, \"Get your own, you Sushi Purest! I don't wanna contribute to your dedicated life-choices by my oh so common taste-buds.\" :) 

Average to high price, but I'm cheap so its probably average. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! All you can eat. It is deceiving on the outside as you think it is a little restaurant but it is actually a huuuge space inside. Booths tables and a lot of staff busily buzzing around like worker bees.

The staff is important because something to note was that during this visit, we didn't wait long for our food. The all you can eat comes in two prices as you can opt for the deluxe that features some of their premium items which I think is worth it.

The portions are small but that is good for buffet addicts like me that want to pay for selection and variety rather than solid big portions.

I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Just a few more reviews and I should have my ribbon. Hopefully it comes with a prize"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because the chef used to work at Shibuya - one of my favorite sushi place in Calgary, opened up his own restaurant. From what I've heard, it is similar to Shibuya but AYCE. Honestly I can spend the same amount of money and get better food and service at Shibuya. Their food took a very long time to arrive. Fish was not that fresh. Lamb skewers were cold and hard when it arrived. Service was slow. I will not come back as I have had better sushi at other places for the same price if not less."}
{"text":"Have been here a few more times since my last visit, and service has only improved. One waitress I have gotten multiple times, and she always remembers me and my dietary restrictions. Yay! Also, they handle groups pretty well. Would recommend for an inexpensive birthday celebration."}
{"text":"Loved the all you can eat sushi!! The staff were very friendly both times I have been there would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We got there around  1:35 and they told us they will stop lunch service at 2:30.  We told them that was fine.  They sat us us down and told us we should only order enough to eat and don't waste food because they will charge us for any uneaten food. Also they told us we can only order 10 items each time. I felt so rush to get all my food before 2:30. Everything that we ordered came in small plates.  The food was ok but my husband didn't think there was enough of a sushi selection.  We ended up our meal with ice cream."}
{"text":"We've tried Oishi Sushi last night based on a friend's recommendation.  I am a bit of a sushi snob after working at a high end sushi restaurant back in my college days, but Oishi Sushi really exceeded my expectations. There were a lot of options and our waitress recommended a few dishes to try based on our preference. Contrary to what other reviewers wrote here,  we actually had great service. I highly recommend trying their sashimis, but the stand out dish for me was the scallops. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Originalité, diversité et raffinement. Voilà comment je qualifierais cet excellent petit resto de sushis de la rue Bernard. Chaque fois que j'y suis allé, je n'ai jamais été déçu. L'ambiance calme et décontractée est propice à la dégustation de ces petites bouchées tombées du ciel. Bref, on y retourne sans réserve mais sans oublier de réserver, car il y a souvent beaucoup de monde, surtout les week-ends."}
{"text":"The only thing I hate about this place is that I have to drive pretty far, but after eating I remember how much it was worth the drive! 

I definitely recommend paying the extra to get the additional menu options! Definitely worth it! Who doesn't love unlimited crab? I just can't explain how many delicious options they offer here, you have to try it for yourself! The price is definitely fair and if you're hungry for sushi or more, this is the place to be!

The best part after eating here is the ice cream you get to devour in the end! That green tea is the bomb! However, one time when I came here we finished eating and just had ice cream left, but it took the server over 20 minutes to get us the ice cream? It was very busy at the time, but still, it shouldn't have taken that long... For the most part the service is fast, when it's really busy they tend to be much slower. But with any restaurant this is inevitable."}
{"text":"Went here on the weekend for lunch and food/service was fantastic! Had never been to an AYCE sushi place before, was pleasantly surprised! Everything was super fresh and the service was very prompt. Definitely a great deal for $17.99/person. The amount I ate would have cost $30+ at the normal rates. Will be recommending to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"This is the newly renovated one located on Riverbend.

It's eat all you can for 27.99/head. Very good taste and quality of food. The service was good though the staff was confuse with our orders- we didn't mind cause we got pauses in between our orders that allowed us to digest. 

There were too many choices though that gets confusing sometimes though it's okay once you look at several times!"}
{"text":"Do you want to gain a lot weight for your next acting gig? Then come on over to Oishii. I promised, you'll get fat in no time. 

Note that Oishii ain't Wa's or Zipang, but its a hell of a lot better than your average Calgary sushi joint and great value. I do not know how this restaurant makes money, as the food is good, and great for an all-you-can-eat Japanese restaurant. 

Winners: Creamy udon, salmon nigiri, beef enoki nigiri, deluxe menu, seaweed salad. The rice in the rolls/sushi was good. 

Losers: Oyster Motoyaki was small and fishy, the scallop nigiri was too sweet and overly mayonnaisey. 

Tip: Sit at the booths, service is great there but not so much near the kitchen. DO NOT ORDER TOO MUCH FOOD AT ONCE! When in doubt, order less. Ask your server for advice and you won't be grossly stuffed like I was. The rolls are very large and most are drenched in spicy or creamy sauces, so go easy on them."}
{"text":"La déco est sobre, mais moderne et jolie. Ils ont un excellent rapport qualité prix, et la livraison est gratuite. (J'avoue, mea culpa, on est de grosses feignasses!) Mention spéciale pour leur Maki et notamment le Maki Printemps! Un de mes sushis préférés de Montréal!"}

{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time when they first open I came for a birthday celebration but the service and food was terrible. Our sashimi was frozen. 

However, they have improved. Came for dinner for two on a Friday at 6 pm. Parking lot fills up fast since there so many businesses in the complex. The front host wasn't attentive stood there flipping through paper while a line formed. Not until the lady in front spoke up did he started to seat people.

The atmosphere at this restaurant is open and modern. Lots of seating and clean. The waitress was friendly and came by often to get our order. The food was really good. We love the beef tataki the most. Portions are small but that prevents waste. 

It's a bit expensive for deluxe all you can eat is $35. Overall all the sushi options were delicious and I would come back.  For the sweet tooth lovers there ice cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi place in Montreal with Tri Express.

Everything is always fresh and delicious. I recommend to try the beef sashimi, and the mikan roll. Simple but so good. I always order different \"chef's specials\" but I always get these 2 things for sure...
Other dishes like teriyaki or noodles are a bit less surprising but still good. 

The service has always been perfect. Nothing to say about it.
The ambiance is ok, generally the music is not loud at all and people remain pretty quiet, that's appreciable. Not too crazy about the interior design but WHO CARES!

Almost 5 stars; The only thing I noticed, is that it's not as good and fresh when you order to go. A couple of times I ordered sushi or udon and I was really disappointed. So you'd better want to eat in."}
{"text":"Oishii is by far the best all you can eat sushi I've found in Calgary thus far!

There are definitely times that it's a busy place - Friday and Saturday nights especially - and they don't take reservations for small groups, so plan your trip strategically! If you are willing to wait, Riverbend Station is a good local pub. But save lots of room for delicious sushi!!!

I've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed. The little portions are just perfect - you can try a little of everything without feeling like you have to pack away huge portions of food. We definitely have our faves: California roll, spicy salmon or tuna roll, the mango roll and the little appies like the Thai spring roll, pork dumplings and the chicken teriyaki. Heck it's all good! Be sure to save room for ice cream with tempura bananas! 

The service is great and the food comes out quickly. They don't keep you waiting around for more rounds of food either. We come every few weeks and will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Update: Food is still good but service is now terrible. Be prepared for long waits for service and missing items."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant, good service, fresh quality food with a broad menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Loved it! Tried the  Deluxe menu, beyond expectations. Kids friendly. Oysters and Sushi great value for the money and obviously all you can eat"}
{"text":"I was at Oishii Sushi for the first time on Saturday. 
We were a big group and given that the restaurant was packed - the service was actually very good. 
I am from Vancouver and know my sushi so I am a harsh critic when it comes to fresh, inventive, well presented and value driven sushi.  I would say that I have had sushi only twice in Calgary and this is the only place that I thought was ok. I don't expect it to be as reasonable as in Vancouver but I do expect good quality. Typically as a rule I don't eat the sushi unless I can see the ocean - but this place was pretty good. We did the All You Can Eat menu - which we typically also don't do but given the price here in Alberta and that there were so many in our group. It seems like a good option for value.  I didn't try the sashimi but most everything else was good.  Although I typically I don't tempura - the tempura here was amazing - super light and not greasy."}
{"text":"Our favourite Japanese rest in our neighbourhood.  Small place.  Nice sushi and sash ini selection.  I enjoyed Udon noodles there last time I went...but the Tempura was a bit on the soggy side."}
{"text":"This AYCE place was a delightful surprise, great quality sushi, and a good assortment of different sushi and sashimi to choose from in addition to all the other stuff.  The rolls were very good.  I appreciated the fact that they didn't overload your sushi  with large quantities of rice.  We ordered in three waves and there was a minor slow period of when our food came out but it allowed us to enjoy it at a decent pace.  We were a group of 8, and it was everyone's first time there, and we all enjoyed it.  They serve what we ordered family style but if you ask the can separate it, but we didn't care about that.  We went for the deluxe menu and it was a good choice.  Everyone in your group has to go with the same, you can't have some going with the regular menu and some with deluxe."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for all you can eat sushi, yet a 2 star. My first experience, went with my son, we were told there is 30 minute wait, which was no problem. After 45 minutes and respectfully the place was busy, I overheard the host telling the guys ahead of me that they should leave and come a different night as they have two parties of 8 ahead of them and last call is at 9:30. Well I then went to the host and he told me the same, and I refused.I have never in my lifetime been asked to leave after waiting 45 minutes for a table.That is poor customer service. So with almost 30 minutes before the last call, we ended up with a table, ordered lots of food, and it all came out, and was absolutely amazing for a all you can eat, I was so happy, and impressed with the quality, quantity, and taste, made up partially for the wait, so I went the second time recently and had a 30 minute wait again, no problem. After getting seated, I ordered and everything that came was great, as before. But not all items came,,..and our waitress did not tell us why or if it was still coming. Both times the waitresses worked very hard, lots of running around, but i find them very disorganized. I will continue coming back hoping to see them improve on their service, but the food I give a 4 star."}
{"text":"The decor is nice and the service is okay. The AYCE sushi was delicious and so far has never disappointed me. I would suggest making a reservation for Friday evenings because they get really busy and the line up is endless. The only negative I would have to say is that the hostess practically begged for more tips as we were about to head out, I just found it to be unprofessional."}
{"text":"Went here for all you can eat sushi dinner! Bottomline: best all you can eat sushi in Calgary! It costs $26 per person for sushi and sashimi and $32 for the deluxe menu which includes oysters and tataki. 

We went a little overboard with ordering rolls (to the point that the waiter asked if we were sure we can finish haha) and then regretted it shortly after! There is a charge for unfinished food so it was a little stressful haha 

We ordered the mango dragon roll (prawn tempura and avacado with mango), Philadelphia roll, spicy salmon roll, beef udon, miso soup, salmon and tuna sashimi, salmon rose and prawn tempura. Out of these my favourites were the spicy salmon and the mango dragon roll. I didn't love the tempura personally because it was a bit soggy. Didn't have room for dessert after all this food so can't comment on that haha"}
{"text":"From outside, you wouldn't think much of this place but once you go in, you would be impressed by the huge open space and view to the kitchen. Came here for lunch for an AYCE at $18 once and I thought that's a pretty good price. I wouldn't be surprised if the price goes up in the near future.

I thought all of their sushi rolls were great and they may be the best in the city for an AYCE. The fish didn't stink and I thought the rice was nicely prepared as it was soft, not sticky, and not cold. Food came pretty fast.

Where I felt Oishii Sushi lost points is in the hot food category. Besides the egg drop soup, which was a little thicker, more flavorful, and more generous on the ingredients than most places I've tried, I thought the shrimp tempura, teriyaki beef, and other hot foods failed hard even for an AYCE. Oishii didn't use panko bread for the tempura, but seemed to have used just plain flour or something similar: it wasn't crispy. The teriyaki beef had a runny sauce that didn't have much flavour. Other hot foods were underwhelming as well.

3 stars seem a little low as I think it should be a 3.5 but the unimpressive hot food got me. Eat cold, yelpers! I definitely would come back and try their dinner AYCE menus. Apparently, there are two types at night."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in Calgary, hands down. I have not been to every single one, but I have been to most, and this place has great service, a wide selection, and good flavours. We really enjoyed our time here."}
{"text":"S was craving AYCE so we decide to check out Oishii Sushi for some Saturday night all you can eat festivities. Holy crap, why is this place so busy? We arrived at 6:00pm and had to wait about 10-15 minutes to grab a table. Seriously? I don't understand.

Prices depend on age and when you come in. Lunch time is $16.99 for 14 and over ($17.99 on weekends) and dinner time is either $27.99 or $32.99 (for the deluxe premium menu). Pretty standard pricing for AYCE. Is it worth it? Read on grasshopper.

The menu is massive and has everything under the sun. Great if you like variety. Not so great if you like quality. There is a separate deluxe menu ($5.00 extra) where you can order extra items.

Good
- Salmon and tuna sashimi
- Tuna tataki

We ate a loooooooot of food. Think we finished with four full orders. You can never get your money's worth from AYCE but we gave it our best shot. I doubt I'll be coming back anytime soon but if you do, order smartly and get the salmon sashimi. A lot of it."}
{"text":"I won't mince words: Oishii Sushi is the best AYCE Sushi experience in Calgary in all aspects. 

I've had my eye on Oishii for a while now, but haven't really bit the bullet to go as it is a little far from downtown. I am glad I finally made the trek on a whim on a Friday night, because it really hit the spot for me. Despite the nondescript outside appearance of a small restaurant in a strip mall, it actually is massive, modern, clean, and well apportioned from a space perspective. Great ambiance - lively but not roaring. The Bathrooms were unexpectedly clean, classy, and well designed decor wise, with soft jazz playing for your while you make room for your next order.

It was extremely busy. I don't know if I just picked an uncommonly busy Friday to try my luck, but I showed up at 6:10 and wasn't seated until 6:40. The joint was packed despite having a huge number of tables. 

Luckily I got a quiet corner booth. Overall the quality of the space is high, and cleanliness standards are well above average. Service was very good. The servers were prompt, checked in on you often, and never messed up an order (which is unheard of for AYCE Sushi, they always forget something). 

Now, onto the menu. Regular Dinner ($28) and Deluxe Dinner ($33). The additional items offered on the deluxe menu were not worth the value for me as only one of us would have enjoyed it - the only things that caught my eye on the deluxe menu were the crab legs, oysters, and Tataki. Everything else (beef rolls, for example) I see as low value and not worth it. 

That being said, the regular dinner menu was actually pretty impressive. Of course, my focus was sushi: the rolls are pretty generous with fish content and don't overload on rice, which is a mistake I see at many sushi AYCE. The sushi had a pretty thin cut of fish, which is less desirable, but with Sashimi on the menu, you can make up for that. 

The Sashimi selection was okay, but the sashimi order always arrived dead last after a long delay as compared to everything else. This was a turn off for me, as it was so exaggerated it was clearly an intentional method to ensure that you wouldn't order too much sashimi. So if you go, make it a point to order extra sashimi in your first order, and then expect to have it arrive with everything else you've ordered for your second order. 

A few interesting ones that I don't usually see elsewhere: I liked the Salmon Yukke (tartar), and the creamy udon. I would avoid the dim sum as it is mediocre. 

Overall very good experience at Oishii - going forward there is absolutely no where else i will go for AYCE Sushi."}
{"text":"I went with 2 friends of mine for a business dinner and the food was good. Came out quickly (the first round). However, we literally had 2 pieces of sushi and some strands of udon noodles left and the waitress said we had to finish them or else they would charge us full price for those plate. Are you kidding me? I understand some people take advantage of an all you can eat place and waste food, but with the quantity of food that we had left was unnecessary for them to charge us."}
{"text":"We risked it, we decided to go here tonight without being able to make a reservation, and it was completely fine. This visit was totally worth it.

This place has absolutely the best Japanese AYCE in YYC. At $27.99 for their \"dinner tasting menu\" we got a great selection of cold and hot items to choose from. There is also two free \"chef special\" items you can select with your meal as well. We laughed at how they have dim sum on the menu, and did not try it... but I'm sure it would have been good though. 

All their food was fantastic! From the simplest dishes like \"sashimi salad\" and \"egg drop soup\" you can taste the quality difference compared to other Japanese AYCE places at the same price point. Most of what we got had great plating, even my one order of takoyaki had garnishes at the bottom. I love their attention to detail here. 

Their house special roll is fantastic :) it was a deep fried tempura roll with just a hint of tabasco after taste to it. Delicious! 

We had to of course finish off with some sweets for dessert, they've got ice cream available... which they garnish with a fried taro chip and whipped cream. Ahhhhh the simple things in life delight me.

Will be sure to come back time and time again... as long as I can actually get in that is ;)

P.S. They have lemon slices with their ice water :) its all about the details."}
{"text":"I had an enjoyable lunch here.  For an AYCE place it's pretty decent.  

Service was a bit slow and food was also slow to come out of the kitchen but luckily we had no time constraints.  However, I can see this as a problem  especially if you're on a lunch break.  

It was nice that the cooked foods are tapas size because it allowed us to try many different items on the menu. The sushi rolls are normal roll size.  

Lunch AYCE menu is different than the dinner AYCE menu.  Apparently the dinner AYCE menu has a few additional items including sashimi.  There is no sashimi on the lunch AYCE menu.  If you don't want AYCE they also offer a la carte ordering, including lunch combos.  

Inside is new,  clean, large,  and nicely renovated...which adds to the ambiance.  I hope it will stay like this :)"}
{"text":"I've been here once or twice before, the service wasn't bad but it also wasn't amazing. 

I came here the other night with a few people, and right away the service was terrible. It was slow and all of the employees there seemed to be in such a bad mood. Our refills for drinks took forever, as did the food and desserts. It took over 15 minutes for some small bowls of ice cream to be brought over. I understand that it was a little bit busy, but literally none of the staff members had a simple smile on their face even when speaking to customers. 

Food was pretty good though, although I did feel sick/nauseous for the next day or two."}
{"text":"Two members of our party which dined here at dinner got very sick and threw up the entire night. Will not return, and would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in Calgary so far! All the fish seems to be nice and fresh every time I have gone. Love going to the all-you-can-eat dinner. Plenty of seating for large parties. It gets a bit loud in the evenings so it's no the best for a romantic date night. But I love this place!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely devastated. Hoping for a pleasant dinner around the dining room table with some friends before we head out to begin a night of partying to ring in the new year, I placed an order for about 50$ of food. An innocent enough request -- however, you'll never guess what happened next. After an hour and a half of waiting, feeling pangs of hunger deep in our stomachs, the delivery man arrived. Our total was 43.60, and, lacking any smaller change, my dear friend Miranda handed him three twenty dollar bills. He asked how much she wanted back and then told her he did not have any change. Being university students who lack the means to tip 15$ for a small food delivery order, we requested for him to find change for us. He then left. We opened our food -- half of the orders were inedible. Soggy, cold, only half cooked. One order was wrong. The miso soup was beginning to form a thin layer of ice. We called back, complaining, and they proceeded to block our phone number. We called on another phone, and after that they blocked that number as well. We are now waiting for a new order to be delivered... but our hope is mostly gone."}
{"text":"The service was okay when it was present. The menu, particularly for an all you can eat sushi restaurant in Calgary, is worth 4 stars; broad and creative. The decor and atmosphere was social and bustling. It's not for intimate and romantic but perfect for a small gathering of talkative people. Most of the food tasted good as well. Here's the reason for the poor rating; we were served three pieces of crab and the first piece, the claw, was bad. We had a child in a high chair that could not get close to the table because of the table's base so we spent too much of the night cleaning up spills that we should have left for our waitress who didn't blink when I told her that I had started into the bad crab meat and was nearly ill on the spot. If I had to guess the reason for her lack of empathy or even interest I would say it was likely a familiar comment, not a new experience for her. Do not bother with the sunomono if you want the actual salad because it lacks noodles but it's served in a pretty dessert glass to make up for it. We paid a little extra for the extended menu and couldn't eat more after the crab - which they didn't even come get immediately or offer new plates so ours no longer smelled bad - but it was worth it (I'm kidding) because the waitress eventually said the management was sorry and would not charge me for my Diet Pepsi. It was flat and our two year olds half glass of apple juice was $3 but my pop - to wash down the turned shellfish - was free. Do we risk going back again? Unsure. One final tidbit. We asked for a different sitting arrangement before we sat down to dinner originally but were told the more accommodating area of the restaurant opens at a later time then where we were sat. Odd. Is this restaurant already to sure of itself to actually care about its patrons? I sure hope not. Calgary already suffers with groceries that are too expensive, trades that couldn't care less, disgruntled employees, a lack of jobs, and a general apathy in customer service. We don't need another disconnected business but we could always use another option for where to spend an evening relaxing with friends and family enjoying good food and a laugh."}
{"text":"Everything was just perfect. This is worth the money and our time to drive! Recommend this place to everyone! *drools*"}
{"text":"I'll admit it... This is probably the best AYCE sushi restaurant in Calgary at the moment! The chef use to work for Shibuya Izakaya and I guess decided to open up his own place down south. The interior is very nicely designed with open concept kitchen. The menu itself is VERY extensive and has so many different hot and cold dishes. The few items that stuck out for a Japanese restaurant was that they were serving Chinese items like Siu Mai, Har Gow and Ginger beef. For a sushi restaurant they serve bomb dim sum, surprising.

I only went for lunch and the place was still kinda busy for 1pm. The service was quick and the food came QUICK!! Meaning Takoyaki balls came out within 3mins of placing the order. Maybe it was because the tables were starting to clear out but great for us! The food is very well presented and attention to detail is not lost. Every dish leaving the kitchen was perfectly plated and garnished regardless of the quantity of the items. 

This AYCE sushi place is a definite must try especially for the dinner deluxe menu where there is beef tataki!!! Eating just a few orders of this dish would pay for your entire meal!!! Happy munching!

Must order:
1. Oiishi deluxe
2. Hand cones (they do not cheap out on the meat within them)
3. Takoyaki"}
{"text":"Seulement testé en livraison. Tout était excellent ! Frais, originaux et beaux makis."}
{"text":"The only highlight was the friendly service. Sushi was mediocre by any standards and the chicken we ordered was cold. For Calgary the AYCE sushi wasn't great and downright terrible compared to real sushi in actual cities. Tired of mediocre sushi in Calgary."}
{"text":"Pretty good for all you can eat.  The menu is quite large and you order using a notepad.  The kitchen missed the rolls we had listed at the bottom so we prompted our waitress.   Service was ok and most of the food came out quickly.  Some coordination in the kitchen to put everything on the same plate would be nice so we don't end up with 10 little plates at once."}
{"text":"They used to have a really good all you can eat menu when they first opened, but some items have been removed. Service is quite slow. 

Not ideal for lunch if you need to get back to work"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place based on the good reviews I've read on Yelp. When I first went in, the place looked nice, and the washroom was very clean (that's probably the only positive thing you'll hear from me). 
Where should I even begin? The first thing I noticed was that the ordering system sucks compared to Blue Fin. Blue Fin has iPad's where you basically just send your orders through the iPad and your food comes right away. This place, you have to order on a piece of paper and hand it to one of the staff (if you can find any of them). They literally play hide and seek whenever I'm ready to order, it seems. We finally ordered our food, and I kid you not, half of the food that we ordered DID NOT come. We didn't complain because we kept thinking it was coming, and it was just inconsistent that we were very unsure of what to expect. Another reason why we didn't bother complaining is because the food does not taste good at all. It's very bland, and I'm talking about the rice, soup, sushi, tempura, basically everything we got. None of the food stood out compared to when I went to Blue Fin. The sushi at this place is the worst I've ever had, and that's coming from someone who knows sushi very well. Also, during our meals, one of the staff kept taking a menu that's on our table and a chair which I thought was weird and has never happened to me before at any restaurants I've been in. Lastly, this is one of my biggest complaint, and I'll put it on caps just to make it very clear that this place is on my \"Do Not Recommend\" list:
WHEN WE WENT TO PAY FOR OUR MEAL, THE LADY LOOKED AT THE RECEIPT AND SAW HOW MUCH WE TIPPED HER AND HER RESPONSE WAS \"THAT'S IT?\" I AM NOT KIDDING, THIS HONESTLY HAPPENED. MY MOM HAD TO FIND CASH IN HER WALLET SO THAT SHE CAN GIVE HER MORE TIP. It's not the tipping that made me angry because I usually tip very well especially if the service is outstanding. I think that tipping is not mandatory and it's rude of her to ask for more tip when the service and food was not worth it at all. And if you're wondering, we already tipped 15% of the bill. I was honestly in shock and because of this lady, I will make sure to tell all my friends and family my negative experience at Oishi Sushi and hope that I discourage them to visit this place."}
{"text":"I love coming to Oishii for my takoyaki and sushi fix. The thing is, you have to adjust your expectations when you come here. They are not comparable to a Japanese or sushi restaurant, but they should be compared to other all you can eat restaurants. In that category, I think they do a good job of maintaining quality, taste and service. They're also one of the only ayce places in the SE. 

In terms of food, I think they have one of the best selections of cooked and raw (sushi) menus for an all you can eat place. They also have a selection of dishes that I've never really seen elsewhere (eg. Natto, creamy yakidon, whole roasted makerel, etc).

 All of their cooked foods are pretty tasty, as are the sushi rolls. My favorites are still the red coral roll, Hollywood roll and fire Kirin roll.

I do think that their portions are often skimping (especially the sashimi, tataki and yuke), but it doesn't usually bother me because I'll order more ahead knowing this. I should clarify, this may not be the case for a la carte, just for ayce. 

Service is also usually really good. The servers are usually very friendly and helpful, especially if you've never gone there before. They're also quite attentive. It never takes too long to get a new order in and food is usually out within 10-15 minutes. 

Overall, come to Oishii if you want a good all-you-can-eat experience and you want to try a bunch of different dishes. Do not come to Oishii expecting a good sushi restaurant; that's not what it is."}
{"text":"Parking 1/5 big parking lot but no spaces

Environment 3/5 place is very nice and open washroom is very clean. 

Food 2/5 sushi rolls were great. Beef Tataki & Creamy Udon was made to look and taste like Shibuya's recipe but didn't not taste as good. Beef Tataki lacked the shredded radish. Creamy udon was bland. 

Service 1/5 we were told to pre order food when we made a reservation so we pre ordered, but when we came nine of the food was ready. Came here at 7:30 was told we had 2 hours to eat , the food showed up as 1 plate with 6 pieces every 15 mins. Had to ask for the manager at 830 to voice concerns and then food started coming out. Only after voicing my concerns did the management take out tables orders and put them through. 

Unfortunately I came all the way to the south to try this out based on good reviews but unfortunately I will not be back. I don't mind paying for quality food and service."}
{"text":"July 30; The positive part of the review is that the food is always definitely high quality and better than most AYCE sushi places, I love everything and the food gets to the table in a timely matter after ordering. The negative part of this review is that after eating there today I went up to our waitress to pay and I already gave a tip... she handed me a $5 off voucher for dinner the next time we would go, after she saw the tip I gave her she asked me \"was my service not good?\" confused I said no it was great! she then basically tried to guilt trip me by saying that if her manager saw the \"little\" tip she got he would get mad at her and expected me to hand her some more cash as extra tip, I told her I had no cash and she then insisted I use my debit... I basically paid for that $5 voucher. 

update: I went back today and it was pretty good we got another server who was very much kinder and nice. she didn't force a tip or anything, she's honestly my favourite because she remembers us whenever we go there and knows what we prefer seating wise, utensil wise etc..."}
{"text":"Me and some friends went here on a Friday night to grab sushi around 7pm! It was quite busy and we waited around 30 minutes to grab a table. Kinda sucks that they don't take reservations. 
We were seated and given the all you can eat menus. Thankfully my friend use to work their so she knew to ask for their regular menus. So remember to ask for both menus if you don't want all you can eat sushi. 
There was 8 of us at the table and our server took our orders. I really didn't like that all the food comes out at different time. 3 people got their food, and then 30 minutes went by until 1 other person for their food, and then another 20 minutes until everyone had their food. The kitchen also forgot to make 3 of the tables dishes and took another 20 minutes to get the rest of it out. Just seemed like a gong show and the food runners putting random food on our table that wasn't ours. 
When we did get our food tho it was excellent. 
Thankfully our server apologized for us having to wait so long for our food so the whole table got Ice cream on the house which was very kind of her. 
The food here is great but I think the service could improve!"}
{"text":"This is in the se of the city by a town center...there's shoppers close by and some other businesses.
The place is pretty huge you can see the sushi chefs preparing your food. When you go in they got different kinds of sake looks so yummy 

The serving is pretty good size...we were scared to order too much since we were with our parents. 

For your birthday...you get free tea...one per table... my mom n I ate celebrating our birthdays back to back...but restaurant policy...only 1 free tea a table.

They got Takoyaki which most Japanese place don't include...I just find they put too much sauce...

I do like that they have green tea ice cream and the deep fried banana to go with it is yummy... I like how their ginger is white not pink! Their Wasabi is not really as potent. Those are the only thing that stuck out....hence 3 stars

Their food ain't too bad. Service is fast. We are glad we got a fast server...the other servers wasn't as swift.

We went there right at lunch time and it wasn't busy until later on...

Overall experience was good. I gave it 3 stars since the server wasn't as swift...it matters specially when you are very hungry."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this restaurant. Went on New Year's Day and the place was practically empty. The Holiday might have contributed to the fact they had the largest cuts of sushi/sashimi I've ever experienced at a sushi restaurant. Fish tasted super fresh as well. They had creative specialty rolls and the miso soup was homemade. I thought the restaurant was affordable in comparison to my Normal sushi experience."}
