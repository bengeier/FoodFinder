{"text":"We just moved over to this area and are looking for our favorite spots around here.  Thai Thai Kitchen is a delightful surprise tucked away in a little corner mall at 19th ave and Peoria.  We know our Thai food, and this is as tasty, fresh and beautifully prepared as anything we have had in pricier places in Scottsdale.  The proprietors are lovely (a woman from Bangkok, her two delightful teenagers and her personable husband), the service was great, and they got the spice level right for once (5 stars for us!!). This is our favorite place in our new hood.  Thanks, Thai Thai Kitchen!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I have been here a few times and it has been great! Nothing is too strong or too light in flavor. Almost never busy. One of my favorite spots for Thai food in the valley."}
{"text":"On my way to the airport my flight was delayed.  A quick search and I found this place.  Walked in it was completely empty no worries I read great reviews.  Service was great food was sooo fresh and exceptional.  We have never had better Thai.  I will come back and bring friends as I have found a hidden gem.  This is worth traveling to eat here."}
{"text":"This place has great food for a great price! I had chicken pad Thai for half the price than a place a couple blocks away. And it was better!  Everything was amazing. My husband and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the bestThai restaurants in town!  The Pad Thai  and Penang curry OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I got a craving for Thai food while at Sam's Club. The only place remotely close that was open on Sunday was Thai Thai Kitchen. I'm glad we made the drive! If you can overlook the seedy neighborhood (and please do!), you won't be disappointed.   They've been open 7 months and everything we had today was delicious. I ordered the pot stickers and yellow chicken curry, medium. If you like spicy, you might consider ordering \"spicy\". I wasn't disappointed by the medium, but I've definitely had spicier. My sidekick ordered the Masa-man curry. All very generous portions and filling."}
{"text":"Tasty home cooking Thai style.  The owners are so friendly and make you feel at home, they want you to enjoy every bite. A must have: thai ice tea"}
{"text":"What a wonderful little gem. Found this close to our hotel, and looks like they just recently opened bc the grand opening sign is still hanging outside. Family owned, with the dad coming out to check on us, the kids running the tables and the mom&grandma cooking in the back. You can't get more authentic than that. It felt like you were eating a home made meal. Had the green curry and it was absolutely delicious. Others ordered panang curry, pad Thai and orange chicken and everyone thought their dish was great! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered the yellow curry with chicken and it was amazing!!! So tastey and the owners were so kind. My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken and he loved it, better than panda express! My mom also ordered one of the red based curries and loved it and it was her first time trying curry ever. We also got a chicken appetizer with their peanut sauce which was also delicious!! Seriously this place was the bomb . com!!"}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations.  I've gotten takeout from several Thai restaurants within a 10 mile radius and that's the first time I've had that happen.  Fast.  Great for takeout.  I got my usual to compare and you just can't go wrong with the egg rolls, yellow curry with chicken and a nice cool iced Thai tea to wash it all down.  All were fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff. I stopped in for a curry and was delighted by the d√©cor and the family who owns this restaurant.  I will definitely return and bring my friends."}
{"text":"Ordered the Orange Chicken (although this is definitely not a traditional Thai dish) and it was seriously the best ever! It was way better than Panda Express' orange chicken!!! It was to \"Thai\" for!!"}
{"text":"First time trying out this Thai restaurant and I was impressed!  Clean and very modest decor.  The food was awesome.  I had the yellow curry lunch special with vegetable soup.  What a delicious meal and perfect portions.  The Thai tea was a great addition a little sweeter than some restaurants but just the way it should be! I will be definitely back to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"I had Panang Curry and J had Thai Spicy Noddles. We have had Thai food all over the world and this is as good as any we have had. The service is great and the prices are low. What else can you ask for."}
{"text":"So friendly! Great, fast service and amazing food! Highly recommended!! Service with a smile"}
{"text":"Took my family to eat here for Mother's Day.  The food was amazing!  Also, the staff were super friendly.  They each gave my mom and sister a rose which was super nice of them.  I would greatly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We discovered this hidden gem through Yelp. The 5 star reviews are all true. I ordered the Seafood Pad See Yew and my wife ordered the Cashew Chicken. We shared a bowl of the Won Ton Soup. The food far surpassed expectations. Both dishes were perfectly seasoned, made with fresh ingredients and ample portions were served. It's unfortunate that the restaurant wasn't busy. In speaking with one of the owners, we heard that they were busy at lunch but not yet at dinner, having just opened in November. People of Phoenix, you need to try this place and support the local business."}
{"text":"A.maz.ing. Incredible food, wonderful service. This is a family owned and operated business, the wife is the chef and the 2 kids are the waitstaff. The husband, David, I would say is general manager. They are so friendly and accommodating. Went there for my birthday tonight with my 2 daughters, my son-in-law and my 2 grandkids. We got pad thai, chicken with eggplant, green curry, veggie fried rice and noodles with mixed veggies and fried tofu. Oh and egg rolls. For dessert we got the fried bananas, mango sticky rice and Thai custard rice. Ridiculously delicious. Everything was so fresh and beautifully prepared, no heavy sauces just tons of flavor. Great value for the dollar too. I can't say enough good things about the place. We're already planning our next visit! If you like great Thai food, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Delicious thai food! Our new favorite since Noodle and Rice closed!  Very friendly owners!  Try the pineapple fried rice!"}
{"text":"Great new place in town. Freshest food for the best price. Great flavor too! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The pad Thai and yellow curry were PERFECT. And the owners are so nice and I love the family owned feel. Kind of a crappy area for a Thai place, but worth a visit. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident.  I made a order to go and the girl who helped me was so sweet.  I ordered Chicken Pad Thai, a Green Curry with chicken and a mango sticky rice.  I got a Thai tea and it is so good. A cute hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Spring rolls with peanut sauce, egg rolls with sweet and spicy dip, yellow chicken curry - all reeeaaally delish! The owners are very nice and attentive. Will make sure to come back next time I'm in the area and looking to grub!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay.  I have had some pretty amazing Thai so this was a slight disappointment.  In a pretty sketchy \"strip\" mall off of Peoria & 19th.    Very friendly service, however.  Probably will not return."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here tonight for the first time. It'll the food was very good and the service was excellent!  We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"At first it felt good to be there.. The ambience and all. However the lady who helped us was having a very tough time understanding us  The Thai ice tea which we order was super sweet (undrinkable) and I told that lady if she could mild it down by either adding additional milk etc. Which like for ever for her to understand and she offered me water to be added in my tea! How gross is that! The egg roles were super oily again.. Super bland with some boring sauce. The pd Thai wad kinda okay!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great! The potstickers were chicken and the sauce was made in the kitchen. The orange chicken was delicious. It was flavorful and had a perfect crunch to it. The Mango and Sticky Rice is one of my favorites and this was hands down my favorite so far. My only reason for a 4-star review is there wasn't much chicken inside of the breading but Other than that is was great. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a delicious restaurant wth an amazing cook. This is our second time here in 3 days. The food is fresh and tasty. The couple who own it are so friendly.  The wife is the cook who is from Thailand.  She is a trained chef and these are her recipes.  My favorites(so far) are the shrimp spring rolls, egg rolls & chicken vegetable soup. My husband likes the shrimp salad (Thai Hot)  & shrimp spring rolls. Reasonably priced with generous portions. If you love Thai food then you need to eat here. You will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"This is an example of truly authentic Thai food. The cook, her daughter, and husband were so kind! They checked on us frequently throughout our meal. I had the ginger chicken. My daughter had the yellow curry with mixed vegetables. The food was extremely flavorful. We enjoyed every bite! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"We had the veggie rolls that were huge and fresh.  Also ordered pineapple fried rice with shrimp. Shrimp was cooked but not over done which seems like most places over do it. Also had yellow curry with veggies.  Good portion size and flavor."}

We had satay, ginger chicken, and green curry.   Sampled the Orange chicken really really good.  We enjoyed the owners and look forward to our next trip back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the Pad Thai and the Green Curry, plus the vegetable rolls. Owners were friendly and nice, plus the food was delicious. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of hidden and at first does not look like such a great location. But once you're inside it's so clean and warm and friendly!   The food is amazing! This is my 2nd time here in 2 Days! First time we ordered papaya salad and chicken satay.  This time I ordered Pad Krapao and Thai custard with sticky rice for dessert.  Everything is soooo delicious and I especially love the friendly service! I'm definitely coming here at least once a week!   The owner gave me a taste of the Thai tea. Prior to this i have never tried it. But it's now one of my favorite drinks!!! I now crave it!   Give them a try! You will not regret it!"}

{"text":"Recently opened Thai restaurant. Delicious food and the nicest most accommodating owners. Started with Tom Kha chicken soup and I am sure I will be regularly craving it. Had the chicken pad Thai. Another delicious dish. Wish my husband would have shared with me as the portions are large. Good thing he didn't agree as he devoured his. Don't be put off by the neighborhood. It's clean and delicious and worth the trek!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new thai restaurant near my house and went there based on the yelp reviews.   I have found it hard to find good thia in phoenix so am always looking.  I was not disappointed with Thai Thai Kitchen.  I had the satay chicken and pad thai shrimp.  Both were excellent.  I asked them to make the pad thai medium spicy and I was not disappointed -  it was spicy so be careful as I like spicy and was glad it was not more spicy.  The restaurant is in a little shady area but the food was great.  I will be back agin."}
