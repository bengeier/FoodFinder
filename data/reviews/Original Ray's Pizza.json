{"text":"Great pizza. Cooked perfectly and ready when promised. I'm picky since I worked in the food industry and they passed."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place and was so disappointed that i never ordered again. It took two hour's to get a cold flavorless pizza which had hair in it by the way. And a steak sub that tasted like the meat was left out for a couple days. Don't order from here unless you want some kind of illness."}
{"text":"As a pizza lover and somebody who works in the pizza business, i always make it a point to try every new local shop that opens. Sadly, this was one of the worst Ive tried. The pizza was average at best. The hoagies (we tried a steak and an italian) were both very sloppily made, drenched in mayonnaise, and the meat on the italian was very cheap and not good at all. Also, i walked in and placed my order, and was told to come back in 40-45 minutes."}
{"text":"An hour and a half for delivery.  And the Italian hoagie has cheap lunch meat not your traditional Italian sandwich meat.  So basically it's gross.  Pinwheels are very tasty though!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out today. I was not super impressed, but I have a feeling I'll try it again later in the future. We tried a white pizza with chicken. It was ok, but white pizza isn't normally my thing. The chicken seems lightly breaded/fried, which was nice. Then we tried the chicken parm hoagie and the buffalo chicken hoagie. Both were a little dry and lacking sauce. Also, the bread's flavor was a little strange, which was a little off putting, but not a deal breaker. They just needed more marinara and buffalo sauce. Lastly, we got a dozen wings. We didn't realize that they are actual whole wings, so they are a good deal for the money; however, they were lacking sauce much like their hoagies. The sauce was too thin and didn't have much flavor. Overall, maybe a 2.5...."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches. 

Decent wings. 

They can be kind of slow and confusing over the phone sometimes. 

The wings used to be a super good deal but they switched to the cheaper, smaller wings rather than full chicken wings so that was a bummer."}
