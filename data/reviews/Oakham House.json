{"text":"This is my go-to place on campus to eat with a friend or do some work. Food is nice and reasonably priced, and the place is always airy and bright. Service can be a little slow at times, but it's never bothered me too much and the price is worth it. The man who I think is the owner or manager is very friendly and accommodating, and staff are usually friendly too."}
{"text":"Best place around Dundas Square to grab very good food at a great price, served by very nice staff! Look for it on Gould St! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Work frequently brings me to the Ryerson campus, and I can never resist dropping by this place for a tea and snack on the go!   I'm always a sucker for vegetarian/vegan options, and Oakham House has several! I'm a big fan of their Tofu Buffalo Caeser wrap (with medium sauce), and I always have my fingers crossed that the soup of the day will be vegetarian- they are always so delicious!  The biggest downside is that takeout orders definitely don't seem to get any priority. I have waited 20 minutes for a breakfast sandwich before! I could fry an egg on the sidewalk faster than that."}
{"text":"One of Ryerson University on-campus cafes, and it's a very cozy and comfortable place to chat with friends or get some studying done or to have a meeting. It's located right within the Student Campus Center and has reasonable pricing. I enjoy their selection of teas and their student breakfast special. :)"}
{"text":"Student loan breakfast is all I need in this world...   For $5.99 you get 2 slices of toast, the second best potatoes I've ever had, 2 eggs, and sausage/bacon.... what a deal! This meal is at least $9.99 at other restaurants like Denny's or Hunters Landing.   The staff here are so friendly and the overall atmosphere is great! I come here to get their iced tea (the best thing ever, MUST try!!) and do my work. This really is my favourite spot on campus.   Im not sure if these are on the menu anymore but in the past I've also gotten their salads and squash soup which I would also recommend! I've been coming here since first year and this is probably one of the few things I will miss when I graduate.   TDLR: get the student loan breakfast and iced tea"}
{"text":"STUDENT LOAN SPECIAL BREAKFAST !  I went to Ryerson for 5 years before I discovered this awesome breakfast deal! It is actually called the student loan special breakfast. You get two pieces of toast, eggs, home fries, accompanied by either bacon, sausage, or chicken halal strips, and coffee or tea! It is only available till 11 am.   For all the Ryerson students who have 8am classes, use this as an excuse to make it to school on time or earlier. It does take a little bit of a time to get from when you order it, because it is a small cafe with a lot of orders so I would recommend going after the morning class.    The sandwiches here always look very fresh and delicious! For all those students who opt for a super clean diet, they have tons of organic snacks!"}
