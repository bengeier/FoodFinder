{"text":"For a big fancy canto restaurant, I wasn't very impressed by the food. The menu didn't have many items on it compared to the other canto restaurants. The food lacked that typical fire/wok flavor. We got the 2 oysters, a chicken pot, the mushrooms dish and a lobster. They all tasted a bit bland. The total was 100$.   As for the service, it's hard to say since it was on the day of chinese new year which means it was packed. The plates came in relatively quick, but it was a bit long to get the bill. However, it was understandable considering the crowd."}
{"text":"New chinese restaurant in chinatown replacing Le Crystal. It is entirely renovated! Yet, some of the table cloth are old and \"dirty\".  I only went there for dim sum. I would say it's like usual dim sum that we find in Montreal. Nothing wow... The presentation of the dishes are definitely not as presented on pictures. In real life, it looks like typical dim sum, not that fancy or nicely placed or whatsoever.  There are not many choices of dim sum places in Montreal anymore. So I would say, if you have a dim sum craving, this is a place to go to! But do not have too high expectations."}
{"text":"I'm glad I finally got to grab some dim sum here this afternoon because I am always in need of good places to satisfy my cravings for char siu bao, among other things.  The space is modern than it's previous incarnation, tastefully decorated but still distinctly Chinese. A major change is the use of the traditional dim sum carts, which I love because I can easily decide if I want to try something new. We grabbed pork meatballs, bbq pork in puff pastry, bun with melting egg custard, a bowl of tripe, beef meatballs, fried pork and shrimp in glutinous rice dumpling (I don't know the English name), and fried squid tentacles. I found everything to be well seasoned, but because we came nearing the end of the afternoon some items were more on the cool side.   Service was very courteous and they were happy to tell us what each dish was, which sort of justifies the price (~ $44 for 7 items and 2 sodas)."}
{"text":"Je suis retourné à l'impériale pour aller au dim sum. La rapidité du service n'a malheureusement pas changé. Il y n'avait pas beaucoup de serveurs et de chariots de nourriture. Bien que les mets étaient bon, la gestion du restaurant demeure toujours un problème."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it! The dim sum was flavorful and HUGE. The trays they come in are cute! The interior is also nice and clean."}
{"text":"The food was alright and came around pretty quickly but the service was not very good as it seems that the restaurants staff either did not really care about checking up on tables or they are understaffed, the restaurants interior is quite nice and the tablecloth was clean but overall ok food, not very good service."}
{"text":"Visited Monday after hearing about this restaurant and seeing endless advertising on Facebook. was excited about a new Dim Sum restaurant since Tong Sing closed, which was awesome. was seated quickly, and given tea. An explanation that in Chinese restaurants the tea is free.  Really?? 2 dishes which were luke warm, and mediocre. Nothing went by that looked like their advertisements, in fact, they just went by without stopping at all.  The icing on the cake was the head waitress asking me if i have eaten Chinese Dim Sum before. One would think that the way i use chopsticks and a bowl and NOT A FORK would give a hint of that. ... 15 minutes had elapsed since a cart stopped at my table, and i was insulted for the second time.  NOTE to readers, i have eaten in Chinese restaurants in Chinatowns all over the world, been doing it since i am 13.  it is not cheap, everything is probably $1-$1.50 per basket more than elsewhere.  will not recommend it, or return."}
{"text":"We went to the Imperial restaurant for Saturday dim sum. Imperial restaurant is located on the sixth floor, but luckily there is an elevator. The restaurant was nicely decorated since it was recently opened. The restaurant was not very crowded when we there compared to other restaurants.  The dim sum dishes were pretty good in my opinion. We had the standard dishes like pork shiu mai and shrimp hai gow. They came in square Imperial bamboo steamers which was a nice touch. My mother was not very impressed with the food saying that the other restaurants dim sum dishes were better.  I thought that the service was pretty good since they took away our trays pretty good. But my mother was angry since they asked for a tip when she say paying the bill! Will we go back? Maybe, since there isn't that many dim sum restaurants in Montreal anymore."}
{"text":"New dim sum restaurant located on the six floor of the tallest building in Chinatown. Even though it's new, it attracts quite a crowd and was busy when we arrived at noon on a Saturday morning. Lots of tables and seating so even though there was a wait it didn't take long to get a spot at table.  They give out generous portions at reasonable prices, with the best quality dim sum you can find in Montreal (however, not really on par with something in New York, Hong Kong or Guangdong).  Your best bet for dim sum in Montreal. Go check it out. It's a real win when a Chinese restaurant in Montreal doesn't make your Cantonese girlfriend upset, trust me."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday dim sum foodie reunion.  This place used to be Crystal ?????The menu probably the same but got a full renovation.  My friends and I both found the service was improved. The waitress here used to give customers the face.  The food was just other other dim sum restaurants. I'd say it is averagely good.  We ordered the usuals like shrimp dumplings, shaomai, portage etc and paid around 20$ each. I'd say it's a very good deal.  The tableware was really elegant with restaurant name embedded."}
{"text":"Went there with family for dinner once. Maybe it was a week day the restaurant was very empty. But came back for dim sum for lunch I was very happy about my meal. They had cart pushing around, not just ordering on papers. There was enough type of dim sum to choose from. (And we choose many!!) Tried quite a bit of food and I find them all above expectation!! They place is clean considering is in Chinatown. Enjoy the spaciousness!!"}
{"text":"Huge dim sum fan here!!  I have been craving for a descent dim sum place in mtl for a while. Red Ruby, Kam fung brossard n chinatown....all meh and don't really like them.  I used to like crystal before the big fire next door,they used to have very freshly made dim sum,a la carte.  Now the new resto doesn't look as nice and they push carts instead of ordering,but The dim sum were good size n yummy.  Its a little bit pricier than other places,but worth the money"}
