{"text":"The pulled pork is nicely smoked--  good selection of sauces, soft roll. Side dishes are acceptable. Not fancy, but reminiscent of BBQ places in the South."}
{"text":"Good food here and Jimmy himself works as well and is a awesome guy.  Try the pulled pork and baked beans soo good"}
{"text":"Burritos are the bomb. Best brisket around. Dude working tonight was super cool. Favorite BBQ spot in the area."}
{"text":"Great I love it. The pulled pork is perfect, just right amount of seasoning. The sauces are fantastic. My favorite is the Mooney Sauce. The wings are dry rub, and they are huge."}
{"text":"I had ribs for lunch, they were hard as a rock and burnt to a crisp.  Hush puppies were not very good either, they tasted old.  The corn bread did not taste fresh, if your not making your own food, what's the point?  Still can't find decent bbq anywhere around these partake."}
{"text":"Awesome. Had the BBQ wrap. One of the best I have had. The sweet hot sauce was perfect."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food!!!  Love their Ribs and all their original sauces"}
{"text":"Well I wandered in here for lunch since there was a sign for Polish Boys out front. For $6.50 I think I did fine! This sandwich had a mild sausage that didn't strike me as a traditional Po' Boy, but it was tasty without being greasy. It was topped with pulled pork and coleslaw. The coleslaw was actually good and not too dry or too drippy. (Of course I am picky enough to have an opinion.) The pulled pork wasn't as greasy as you'd expect either, but for some not-overly-greasy barbeque it was totally full-flavored. I ate in so I got to choose my sauce and I took the traditional BBQ sauce. They toasted the bun which was great texture-wise. I noticed too late that they had fries ."}
{"text":"Jimmy invited me to come back for another visit and I'm glad that I did. The ribs were delicious, expertly prepared and fell off of the bone. Very good flavor just the right combination of smoke and sweet tangy sauce. The sides were very good mac and cheese and green beans. If you like ribs and want support a local business stop in and have dinner you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"This is probably the best BBQ you're gonna find in the burbs....especially Mentor. I usually get the ribs and Mac and cheese. Although, once I tried their smoked wings....holy crap! I never new wings could taste so good! The meat had a great smokey flavor, a real smokey flavor...not like those other places that just use liquid smoke.  Every time I go in I want to try something new, but it just love the ribs so much...I end up ordering the same thing....only with a side of wings too!"}
{"text":"Very nice!  Well  the service was super nice.  I was talking with one of the employees and th explained all the smoked meats.  He informed that it was buy a side and sammy get another sammy for 2$ I was feeling super calorie conscious so I ordered a pulled pork, brisket, and mac & cheese. Under 10$ btw. for all you bargain seekers.   Lets talk about the sauce. The meat was not pre-sauced!  It was smoked with a  rub. You got to choose the sauces.  They have a BBQ, BBQ-Hot, Hot, and a horseradish mayo.  All homemade!  They were all really good.  The meat had a light Smokey taste, not over powering.  The pork had the right amount of tenderness. I could have been eaten with out sauce.  Same with the brisket however it was a little dry.  The portion was pretty nice.  They are pretty generous with the meat.  One thing that I kind of wondered was why the generic bun? It was a hamburg bun.  If this was my joint, I would offer a better bread! Not a deal breaker!!  Lastly, the Mac $ Cheese.  It tasted kinda of bland, not a lot of real cheese, but for 2 $ I was not expecting Gruy√®re cheese! I finished one sammy and a little of the mac! Super full!  Saved the pulled pork  for the following days breakfast!  They have ribs and smoked chicken as well!  Shit brah,if your driving around Mentor Ave definitely give this spot a shot!"}
{"text":"Have been to Jimmy's multiple times. Servings are big for the great prices. Staff is SUPER nice and even talked to Jimmy who was in town one time when we were there. This was his third location... Others are a little south of Mentor about an hour. What I appreciate about this BBQ place compared to others in town are the variety of menu options like the burritos and the chin dripper sandwich (a panini style on flatbread). Sauces are all uniquely different and tasty. Have to agree with others that the sides aren't their specialty. Worth a stop!"}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant tonight. It was actually very good. The sauces are excellence and have much to offer, flavor wise. My husband got the special which was a brisket burrito. It was very large and he said it was delicious. I had the pulled pork and brisket, the brisket was chopped which is a little unusual for a plated brisket. Usually chopped brisket is what you would put on a sandwich. Still, the meat was tender and flavorful, even without sauce. I am particularly fond of the mustard sauce, it reminds me of a sauce we used to get in Texas at a barbecue place called The Salt Lick, near Austin. The green beans were nothing to write home about, and the coleslaw was ok, not out of the ordinary. They were out of corn muffins, which would have been my preference over the dinner , which was from a store package, very bland and no butter was offered.  All in all, I think we would definitely go back there again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Jimmy's is a very solid BBQ spot in Mentor. The meat options are all good and the sides are delicious as well. The burritos are a change from the normal BBQ place and they are great. I have been multiple times and the service at the counter has always been fast and friendly with the restaurant itself being very clean. You should definitely give this place a try if you are craving BBQ in the area."}
{"text":"Honestly, some of the best Ribs you will find.. Also you can't beat the prices they have for lunch specials.. Very cool, little piece of americana.. Oh by the way, everything I have tried has been excellent, and delivered with a smile.. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of being back in Georgia with my family! Brisket Chilli is good but I absolutely love the pulled pork. It's good plain, on a bun or with sauce of your choice!! I need to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the meats are very good.    The side dishes are in need of improvements.  The potatoes taste like they came from a can and beans are nothing special.  Brisket Chili was bland and tasted too much like tomato paste and chili powder.  Better sides combined with their current great BBQ would really improve this place."}
{"text":"Ok... only gave 4 out of 5 stars because I was only there once so far!  But don't kid yourself, I will definately be back!!  I will re-review after second visit.  I heard a lot about this place and wanted to check it out!  We were immediately greeted and introduced to their menu.  Pulled Pork, Pulled Brisket, Pulled Chicken, many sides, and options with the meats!  I got the \"Little Warrior\" which consists of 2 meats, 2 sides, and corn bread.  I got the pulled pork and brisket... WOW!  Both flavorful and juicy!  The cornbread was fresh and moist as well.  The sides I got were green beans and slaw, both of which were phenominal!  There are multiple homemade BBQ sauces to choose from ranging to regular to spicy.  There are many menu options that you can view online.  I really want to check out \"The Chin Dripper\" which you can find and read on their website, I will do it no justice.  All in all check it out!  I am happy Mentor has a real BBQ place and I will be a repeat customer!"}
