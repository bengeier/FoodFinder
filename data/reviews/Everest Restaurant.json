{"text":"finally a great Indian restaurant in Akron area food is very fresh and flavorful
Restaurant is spotless, friendly and quick service"}
{"text":"I've had both takeout and dine-in food from Everest, and every time, it's been delicious. The restaurant has no ambiance to speak of, and the presentation could be improved (my friend and I were excited to get a bunch of cute little bowls when we got the Nepali Thali, but instead we got segmented metal lunch trays that looked straight out of a jail kitchen) but the flavors are on point. The restaurant is run by a local Nepali family, and they tend to throw in little bonuses, like a free pudding, which is a cute way to get us hooked on things we might not have tried otherwise ;-) I look forward to trying the buffet!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! First of all, best masala hands down! Buttered naan was soft, crispy, and flaky in all the right spots. Vegetable korma was flavorful with the right amount of spice. Husband had vegetable thali and it was my favorite! Lentils were amazing and the paneer is the best in the area. Ready to try the lunch/weekend buffet."}
{"text":"Good food and good prices. I always look forward to the buffet. Everything is fresh and well made"}
{"text":"We dropped by expecting the old Raj Mahal, and found the newly opened Everest Restaurant in the same space, instead. The staff explained that this was entirely new management, and the space was heavily cleaned and refurbished. The Everest serves both Nepali and Indian dishes. We stuck to the tried-and-true Indian choices this time around, and we were entirely satisfied. (I think they ran a little bit hotter than the old Raj Mahal cuisine.) The staff was very friendly and very attentive; service was very prompt. We will be back!
(btw, they provided a 10% discount during their grand opening; not sure how long that offer lasts)"}
{"text":"So excited to come back to the Falls and find great Indian food within walking distance of my parents' home. The chickpeas were perfect and even my picky dad loved the tandoori chicken. The naan was fresh and tasted great toasted the next day. I'm looking forward to more meals here."}
{"text":"Enormous improvement over the previous establishment!  It's in the space of the former Raj Mahal.  I had lunch here Tuesday, a vegetarian dish from the Nepalese menu, \"hot\".  Very good portion, plenty of gobi, good spice level.  Will try \"Nepalese hot\" next time, just for comparison.   Indian side of the menu contains some known dishes and some new (to me), so plenty of choices, and a good number of items that my wife can try without fear of 'flame-out'.   No buffet yet, but i was told that they're working on it.  AND it's close to me.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian/nepali restaurant in Akron. I had the malai kafta and it was the best curry I've ever had. They have a buffet every day too! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Everything was so mouth watering and delicious. Definitely will be back. Service was excellent and smiley faces."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, many options, and delicious!! Vegetable momo was amazing! The staff was polite and informative about the menu. Atmosphere has much improved from the pervious establishment."}
{"text":"First time visiting and was pleasantly surprised and impressed. Great food and service. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We loved this place for the lunch buffet on the weekends. My fiancé and I are moving to Lakewood and this gem will be sorely missed. Our waitress was always really sweet and accommodating."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our food. The complimentary tea was delicious. I wouldn't have chosen to order it, but now that I've had it, I would definitely order it."}
{"text":"Got takeout. Very good food and a nice combination of food items to choose from on the menu. Much MUCH cleaner on the inside than the last Indian place that was there. Woman managing the takeout was friendly and helpful. I hope they have a buffet soon!"}
{"text":"First time here, probably the last. The service was fine. The waiter was attentive and friendly. However, the food was not so good. 
My boyfriend and I came for lunch, around 2 PM. The rice was very dry and there were very few options on the buffet. To be fair, it was the last hour for lunch. But I can't imagine it would've been much better earlier in the day. 
I actually felt bad that I suggested that we try the place out. We ended up here because the other restaurants with Indian cuisine stop serving lunch around 2:30. 
I'd recommend driving further to Bombay Sitar in Canton. The food is always top notch."}
{"text":"Everest is operated by a family that Emigrated from Nepal.   It's family owned and operated serving Indian and Nepalese food.  I got the vegetarian Thali and was very pleased with the high quality, the serving sizes, and the outstanding service.  The bindi (okra sauteed with tomatoes and onions- spiced with fresh herbs) was outstanding, The Naan was made to order and served hot.  I ordered a side dish of Raita ( a savory yogurt mixed with finely grated carrots and cucumber) was a cooling contrast to the dishes I ordered extra spicy.  The Kheer ( a rice pudding that is spiced with cardamom, saffron, pistachios, and nutmeg) was a sumptuous treat.  The chai tea was the finest I've tasted anywhere.   The decor is pleasant.  The staff is very helpful and eager to please."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet. The butter chicken was probably the best I had. The tandoori chicken wasn't bad, a bit dry. The vegetable dishes were good as well. Awesome Naan. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for the lunch buffet around 1:30pm and the buffet goes until 2:30pm. I had rice with curried chicken and curried mutton (lamb). The curry was good, but the rice was crunchy.  Also tried the Gulab Jamun which was very good. I would go here again."}
{"text":"The best Indian/Nepali restaurant in the Akron area, perhaps even in the greater Cleveland area.

Try the sadeko masu, it took me back to my days back home in India. The chicken korma was excellent and so was the lamb chatnan. The butter naan was pretty good as well.

This was the closest thing to proper Indian food I've eaten in a long long time. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.

I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A place where the local Napoli and Indian citizens like to eat.  I tried for the first time a Nepalese dish at Everest when I visit on a weekday evening. The rice was a little dry, but that is how it's supposed to be, and mixes well with the main coarse.  The traditional Indian bread was full of flavor and moist.   I experienced the food as average and the service as commendable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch buffet. Good selection, good food, and properly spiced. I'll check out their dinner offerings soon. At any rate, Everest appears to serve legit Indian food and thus far I'm happy to eat what they offer."}
{"text":"One of my new favs.  Everything I've tried has been delicious.  The Thupka is such a flavorful noodle soup.  Have tried the pork and chicken - my preference is chicken.  Both the butter and tika massala curries make me salivate -  I could eat a gallon of it with their naan."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of North Indian/Himalayan cuisine. I go back and forth on whether that or Ethiopian food is my favorite (try that too if you haven't, there's one up in East Cleveland). I am always on the lookout for restaurants serving those cuisines, especially when I'm traveling.
Everest Restaurant is in the location of what used to be Raj Mahal. I ate at Raj Mahal a number of times and the food there was always decent, serviceable though not something I'd necessarily recommend unless someone was in the area, and even then I'd have to give the edge to the Saffron Patch, which is nearby.
I had an appointment at Western Reserve Hospital and it was around lunch time when I got out so I was looking for somewhere to eat in the area. I probably would have gone there even if it was still Raj Mahal but when I saw the restaurant had changed names and management, I was curious to try it. That was the right choice. The food was damn good, comparable to Indian restaurants in some of the bigger cities I've been to. I ordered my Chicken Korma at a \"hot\" spice level and it was perfect for someone who likes spice but also grew up in the Midwest - hot enough that you could feel it but by no means overpowering. They offer a hotter spice level for people who like their food extra spicy but for me, I think I found the sweet spot.
The prices are about on par with what I'm used to paying for Indian food so I figured the value would be too...until I got home and saw the portion that they had given me. I tend not to eat a lot of food in one sitting (and usually take some home with me) but I've found that a lot of Indian restaurants give you relatively small portions for what you're paying. Which hey, is alright if the food is good. In the case of Everest though, it's good and they give you a good-sized portion.
There's maybe one other Himalayan restaurant in the Akron/Falls area that I go out of my way to go to (I'm looking at you, Nepali Kitchen) but I can see Everest becoming a regular after-work stop, even though it's about a 15- or 20-minue detour for me. Especially because I want to try their Nepalese offerings and see how they compare to the Indian food."}
{"text":"I usually go to Bombay Sitar in Canton when I want Indian Buffet, but this was closer to where I live and it came with high ratings.  I must have come on a bad day or bad time, because I was not impressed.  When I walked in, there wasn't anyone in site working.  A young man came out from the kitchen and sat me after some guy eating at one of the tables grumbled something loudly.  

When I went up to the buffet, there was one piece of butter chicken left.  The butter chicken sauce and naan bread were really good.  That's all I really remember about the food.  And it took awhile to get my first refill of water."}
{"text":"Not good. Maybe we've been spoiled by the spectacular Indian buffet in Niles, OH. This was so disappointing. Selection was sparse, salad wilted. Food that was there was only ok. Naan was burned and when gone no more was brought. 
Staff mostly absent and unfriendly. 
Overall very sad. Not sure where the good reviews came from. 
Find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"Awesome little hole in the wall spot, started coming here for the lunch buffet and now it's a weekly tradition. Lost track of how many times I've been, and the buffet has at least 1 new dish every time I come back... Always fresh and flavorful, best Indian/Nepalese food I've found in NE Ohio!"}
{"text":"Really lovely food and super friendly and attentive staff!  We had all Nepalese dishes and they were very tasty!"}
{"text":"Back for a second visit; just as terrific as the first.

This time we tried a Nepali appetizer: Chana Chatpate.  OMG - Nepali Chex Mix.  A very spicy  puffed rice; I couldn't stop eating it."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken korma, butter naan bread, and vegetable samosa to go. It was awesome. I am really glad that this restaurant is here, I used to go to Bombay Grill as I didn't like the Raj Mahal. (Previous owner) but this restaurant is now phenomenal! Go there!"}
{"text":"I didnt expect good meal here cuz its very near from my place. But it was remarkable!

There is no more thing. Food is good!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the server was helpful. Decor is a bit rustic but the dishes were solid enough that it didn't matter."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this place. I have been to India and the food here authentic and delicious. The Nepalese food is excellent. Try the fried dumplings. What an interesting mix of Chinese and Indian. Their masala chai is some of the best I've ever had. I had the Chicken Thupka and loved it. We ordered everything \"Hot\" spice level and it was just right. Try this place! Reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Akron is fortunate to have a recent influx of immigrants from Nepal and Bhutan, and this replacement for the old Raj Mahal restaurant is a welcome new neighbor in the Falls.  Although Raj Mahal's food was pretty good, Everest has raised the bar.  For what it's worth, some friends and I have patronized both businesses several times.

Many of the Indian items from Raj Mahal's menu have remained, and the quality of the food is every bit as good or better.  My better half loves their vegetable biryani and is impressed by the subtle addition of whole cardamom pods and cloves.  

I think it's worth noting that Everest has really improved the facility when compared to Raj Mahal.  We had eaten frequently at the former restaurant over a period of a few years, and the place steadily deteriorated over time.  It quickly became run down, then got pretty dirty in its final year of business.  Everest may not be elegant, but it is consistently clean, and the facility has been upgraded a bit.  Service is also better, and the gal who is our usual server is always gracious, friendly and informative. 

Like Raj Mahal, Everest doesn't sell wine, although they do offer beer.  However, they allow you to bring your own bottle and will provide wine glasses. A small corkage fee is charged, but it is insignificant.  FYI- according to Internet searches, pairing Indian food with wine seems to be a challenge.  Trust me, a dry rosé is usually a perfect choice.  For a real treat, try a sparkling rosé.  (You may thank me later!)

Last but not least, I've started to try the Nepali dishes.  One reviewer referred to them as a fusion of Indian and Chinese- a pretty good description.  Even so, the differences make for a pleasant surprise.  If you're unfamiliar and a little wary, then try the chow mein on the Nepali menu.  Don't be surprised if you never do the Chinese style again.  

However, I just tried the Chicken Thali recently-  a combination of Nepali dishes.  Every last item was delicious.  I ordered mine with a spice/heat level of what I call \"1 Plus\"- a little spicier than \"mild.\"  It included a salad (some raw veggies & a spicy Nepali pickle), a fantastic chicken entree in a tomato-based sauce, a potato and cooked vegetable dish, basmati rice, flat bread, and rice pudding for dessert.  

The most delicious item in the combo was the dal-  tasty lentils that are usually the same wherever you go.  On this occasion, however, they used dal makhani, which you can find in their Indian menu as an entree.  Dal makhani is lentils gone upmarket: butter and cream have been added.  Forget the calories and ORDER this: -Pure Nirvana!  Saying that I was full is a serious understatement.

Now- if you want Indian food in a more posh setting with high prices and so-so service, you can find it five minutes away.  On the other hand, Everest may not be fancy, but the food is amazing, and in my humble opinion, a real bargain.  Just GO- and for God's sake, try the Thali.  Add a good friend and a Spanish or French rosé (under 10 bucks at Aldi) and turn supper into an event!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest. I've only ever had one dish here: extra spicy chicken tikka masala with a side of garlic naan. It's so damn good, I can't stop eating it. I am lucky to have such a great take out option within walking distance of my home.  

After reading other reviews, I probably really need to try their chow mein, too, but when you have found the perfect meal, how do you stray? 

I truly appreciate their spice level accuracy. There is nothing that drives me more crazy than ordering something a 4 out of 5 spice level only to be left wondering if there is even black pepper added. A level 4 at Everest had me nearly sweating. 

I have never sat down to eat, but it always looks clean and the waitress is very friendly. It's not fancy inside, but that isn't a big deal to me. 

If you're in the mood for Indian or Nepali food and you haven't been to Everest yet, go now. Run! Don't walk. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Good service, wide assortment of choices between Nepalese and Indian cuisine, clean restaurant, and fair prices. I just wish the meals were a little more complex. But they're not bad tasting- worth the money. And they make really good leftovers to warm up at home."}
{"text":"Was all very good. I went with my sister in law, who is from Hong Kong but is ethnic Indian. She ordered for the table: Lamb Rogen Josh, Butter Chicken, Chicken Vindalu and tandoori chicken. Everything was fantastic. I will be going back."}
{"text":"WOWWWWW. Omg this is so good. We ordered chicken chow mein, chicken momo, chicken tikka masala, gundruk soup, roti & side of the pickle. 
We all wanted to try each others so we did a variety.
Can't pick which we like the most.. IT'S ALL AMAZING!!!!
The chow mein is like nothing else you've ever eaten. Seriously though, it's so delicious. Go there now!!"}
