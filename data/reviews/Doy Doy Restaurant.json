{"text":"The best shawarma i sweaaar!!  and their serving is pretty rad for one person alone!! You just need to dine in/take out early before missing chicken or beef hahaha!"}
{"text":"Located at dufferin and eglinton this is a nice spot where you can eat healthy and homemade. It's a mom and pop shop and food is fresh. Rice is nice, beef donair is exceptional. The shredded red cabbage is really good. Sandwiches are great as are dinners. You likely will not leave hungry! Prices are very reasonable. If you're not taking out, seating is available where you can eat in peace no tipping or cleanup required. I highly recommend if you're in the area. Just don't go too late as they tend to sell out before closing. Authentic Turkish"}
{"text":"Chicken is raw if you go early in the day and very fatty.  Chicken should be cooked on a flat top after they slice it to ensure that it is cooked like most other places.  They place fat in betwwen the chicken and it is very un appitizing beacsue it is so under cooked.    The prices the have advertized is not what they charge, and the wrong prices have been up since they changed owners.  Don't get the hot sauce, it's just ketchup mixed with chili flakes :/  Most of what is on the menu is not available, and the menu inside has no posted prices, only the one in the window which is misleading and wrong.  I love this kind of food, but this place does it bad.  The only thing that is good is the rice/barley."}
{"text":"This Shawarma place is great, I've been to quite a few places and this place does hold its own. I mean the meat is great, cooked perfectly, and all the fixings are a plenty, with the sauces putting it over the top. The best part about this place is how they prepare it...Most Shawarma place place the toppings in the pita, followed by the meat and the sauce and then wrap it up. Now here they do it a little different, so basically they just mix everything together before they put it into the wrap/pita. This is a crazy good idea, because as you bite into it you get a little of everything, as its all porportioned perfectly...Great Idea, great shawarma place, check er out!"}
{"text":"Indeed, it is the best shawarma in town, The quality of the food is good.  I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"i am a picky guy and i dont give stars eventhough they are free :) i usually dont try to write reviews this quick and i write when i can but this place deserves at least 10 stars so i didnt want to delay this review. the city that i am coming from is well known all over the world for its kebap and turkish pizza, lahmacun.so i know what a good product is i tried their chicken shawarma, adana kebap and beef donair plate. been in the west cost states, all over canada and this is so far the best one.  meat is top quality!! cooking and products they use it very fresh and ingredients are well balanced with the right amount of spice. the owner guy is also very respectful and tries very hard to give you a good food and make you leave happy(definitely not one of those cheap restaurant owners who doesnt even want to give you an extra plastic fork..) price is also very reasonable 7 8 dollars for a shawarma or kebap. location is not the greatest place(at least it seems like because i am a visitor here) but taste is worth going here for sure. in short, this place very well deserves 5 stars"}
{"text":"These people are rip offs. I use to eat here all the time I must say the food is good but the owner rips you off. When I went to pay for my meal he says to me do you have a family to support I say no then he charges me a lot of money for the meal. I never go back to this place ever again!"}
