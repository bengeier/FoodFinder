{"text":"Love this place! The tahini is amazing my favourite is the fried basa plate, great value, well seasoned and super fresh."}
{"text":"The reviews and pics looked good so I waited for a late lunch and drove 20m to your restaurant.

I arrive at 2:15 and you were not open even though your hours on Yelp, google maps, and your website say you are open today at 2. I even tried calling you before I left and it wouldn't ring, number not working. 

Nearly my entire lunch break is gone now and I can't even eat. Very disappointing! :("}
{"text":"I have soo much to say about this place. Firstly, the hours listed on yelp are wrong. They ARE open Tuesdays.. Give them a call if you're unsure. Anyway, onto the review - you will not find fresher, more affordable seafood anywhere in Mississauga, trust me I've tried. I am from a coastal city in Florida, so I know my seafood. The food quality of all the dishes here is impeccable. The fried fish platter with rice and salad is to die for! The staff is extremely friendly, patient, and knowledgeable. My husband and I sampled almost every appetizer and they're all AMAZING. In my opinion you cannot go wrong, although my husband was not a fan of the pickled veggies(forget what they're called on the menu). We have to fight over which appetizer to get! Tahini highly recommended. All in all, if you are in the mood for fish, you won't get a more delicious deal. Usually come out absolutely stuffed with quality food for two people for around 25$."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for lunch. The food is descent, you can only choose from one type of shrimps, 3 fish, 2 of which don't look fresh, and calamari. 
Spices are good, service is pleasant, atmosphere is stingy, restrooms are dirty, and most annoying thing is the price, the fish is way over price. 
I am not sure I'll ever come here again. 
If anyone knows of a good Arabic SEAFOOD restaurant in the GTA please let me know."}
{"text":"For any fish lover out there, you will love this place. The price and the freshness of the fish was definitely what makes this place unique in Mississauga.
I loved the way we could either choose our own fish, which is more expensive but given whole with salad and a pita, and also there is a cheaper option of getting the fish filet, which comes with rice and salad.
Although there weren't many options of the kind of fish to choose from, the fact that they were made from fresh and not frozen was a stand out point, and also that these only costed around $5 more than the fish filet.
I ordered a sea bass and asked for it to be cooked singari style. 
     The few disadvantages about this place was that they lacked vegetarian options, whereby by vegetarian brother only had to eat pita with some dips. The other negative part was that since I ordered the whole fish it took much longer to cook compared to the rest of my party, who ordered the filet or the vegetarian. So everyone else's food was served once it was cooked and by the time mine arrived the rest of my table were done eating. 
     One last negative point was that when we asked for water they served us bottled water, which we did not ask for. This was then charged to our bill. Usually restaurants in Canada do not give bottled water unless asked. 

Nevertheless, my fish was AMAZING, especially with the freshly baked pita bread. It was well worth the wait. 
Highly recommended."}
