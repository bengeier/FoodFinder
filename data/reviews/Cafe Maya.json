{"text":"We just tried the waffles and they were great! The overall vibe of the place is very chill and nice. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Friendly service with a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. Delicious breakfast and drink options. The bagel sandwich and oatmeal were well prepared and happily gobbled up by us. Be sure to try the horchata and chocolate truffles too! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A solid four stars for the espresso, five for the ambiance. The espresso in my latte was a little quiet, but very, very smooth. Milk was steamed to perfection, and just a stir of their local honey is enough to sweeten it.   Great music, plenty of windows - but as other reviewers suggested, not many outlets, so plan accordingly. Great spot to grab a high-quality espresso."}
{"text":"I popped into Cafe Maya after seeing an article review of it online a few weeks ago.  We went in about 45 minutes before closing. The store was clean and comfortable. The employee on duty was friendly and took our order right away. We were the only people in at the time. We got a hot chocolate and an almond croissant.  The drink was flavorful and had a good cinnamon taste. It was served in a small mason-type jar with a dollop of whipped cream and a cinnamon stick. The croissant was flaky and had a really good flavor. Our total was about 8 dollars. Not bad, considering we split the drink and food.  They had subtle Spanish music playing, which was nice. It wasn't too loud or anything. They have free wifi, with the password openly displayed, though we didn't use it. We asked the employee, who said she used to work at the Victor Allen's in the same location, if we could play a board game while we ate. She said that was fine and talked with us for a bit about the game we played.  All in all, we decided we'd absolutely be back. The atmosphere was comfortable, the food was good and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Horchata lattes are my new fav! So glad I can get them so close to home. Very nice and quiet place! I will definitely be back to study. Staff is exceptionally friendly! The only issue is I wish it was open longer on weekends."}
{"text":"I stopped by this morning while waiting for my car to get repaired down the street and was pleasantly surprised with everything about Cafe Maya. I had never noticed it before as it is tucked into a small strip mall that I don't frequently visit. I'm very glad I had the opportunity to stop by! Immediately upon walking in, the staff were friendly and welcoming. I was greeted with a smile and the service was very quick. They have a nice variety of sandwiches, a daily soup, bakery items, mollettes, quesadillas, waffles, and oatmeal. Their drink menu includes your standard hot and cold coffee beverages, smoothies (they had a maple smoothie on special today too), horchata, tea, etc. they also had a drink called a \"horchatte\" which I think I can safely assume is a horchata latte.  I ordered an iced cafe mocha and the rancheros croissant sandwich. Both were excellent and reasonably priced. The mocha had a nice ratio of milk to coffee and wasn't overly bitter as some places tend to be. It was so good that I ordered a second one to-go after I was finished! The rancheros sandwich was served on a croissant with a scrambled egg patty, turkey, cheddar cheese, and a rancheros sauce.  I loved the sauce -- it wasn't overly spicy but it added a nice bit of flavor to the sandwich that I really enjoyed.  Overall, I thought they had a lot to offer in terms of good food, delicious coffee, a nice atmosphere,  friendly staff, and reasonable prices. I'm glad I had the opportunity to visit and would definitely stop again if in the area."}
{"text":"I just found this gem when googling for tea lattes. I'm always looking for a tea latte equivalent to that of Jade Mountain Café on the east side. And to my surprise, the old Victor Allen has been replaced with Café Maya. I went there to get a tea latte but walked out with a Horchatte instead, and no regrets! Just like it sounds it's a blend between a latte and an horchata, ( Mexican rice milk beverage). The second time, I actually got a chai tea latte and it did not disappoint. Some cafes prepare their chai teas with lots of cinnamon, but Café Maya had a good balance. I also ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito. It was a small toasted burrito with eggs, cheddar, chorizo, beans and salsa. The chorizo had a little kick to it, but overall, delicious."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a coffee and saw that they had mollettes on the menu so I had to try those too.  The horchata latte was tasty with a good coffee flavor and just the right amount of sweetness and spice. The mollettes were excellent made with a fresh roll and served with avocado and pick de gallo on top. I will definitely return. Service was friendly. They have breakfast/sandwich menus at the register."}
{"text":"I was looking for something light to eat before heading to the gym and came across Cafe Maya on Yelp. With decent reviews, I decided to stop by. I was pleasantly surprised. It's a cozy little place. I had their Pesto Feta sandwich and it was delicious. Although I didn't have any of their drinks, I plan to go back and do just that. They even have Horchata which I'm really excited about. I also saw that they have oatmeal and breakfast sandwiches. All in all, I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Great place for coffee and excellent selection of pastries and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Cafe Maya has a very cute atmosphere. It is well decorated and quiet. If you want a place to relax, eat and drink coffee cafe maya is the place to go. They are very new to the area so very few people know about it. I've had their hot drink and it was delicious but definitely could have been a little more hot it was a little cooler than i expected but still delicious. I will definitely go back and try their food soon."}
{"text":"Yelp's description of 3 stars is perfect for Cafe Maya. It's A-OK. I've stopped in a few times because they are really close to my internship. The coffee is decent, and the bakery items are too. The decor is fine, but doesn't make me feel cozy. It could be updated, but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"This was first visit here and there was only one barista working but he was very nice. We got an horchata latte \"horchatte\". It was very good!! I also got the maya sandwich and the breakfast bagel. Everything was delightful."}
{"text":"Stopped on the way out of town for a road coffee. Got the Mocha Maya and was pleasantly surprised. It had hints of cinnamon, chocolate, and spice, without being sweetened(which I appreciated.) The staff was super nice."}
{"text":"I stopped in Café Maya in the later afternoon and stayed until closing (5pm weekdays). It was a relaxing place to hang out and get some work done and have a nice lunch. The Maya Sandwich was excellent, I love that it was served with greens and not chips or other carb-heavy side dishes like most restaurants. The service was friendly; I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Definitely come here for the coffee - the espresso is delicious. The food however is lackluster. We waited 30 minutes for 2 breakfast burritos and 1 breakfast sandwich. Why, I have no idea. Slowest preparer in the universe. And I could've made something better at home (and should have). But that coffee is great."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in because we wanted something new. The staff was very friendly and greeted us right away as we walked in. Neither my wife or I are coffee people so we can't say anything about the coffee. What we can say is the baked chocolate croissant was DELICIOUS, buttery and flakey. Not being a coffee drinker, I went for the fruit smoothie. It could have used a little more smooth and a little less ie (ice), but it was still flavorful and tasty!!  But now for the not so delicious, we both went for the breakfast croissant sandwich. While there was nothing 'wrong' with the sandwich, it was more along the lines of a mass produced breakfast sandwich (burger king croissandwich) that had been heated up by chef Mike ( the Microwave oven, that I'm guessing gets used a lot??) and then pressed on a panini grill.  All in all, I would say if I'm in the are and the mood strikes me, I would stop in again, but I don't know if I would make this a destination stop."}
{"text":"Nice vibe and nice decorations. They have coffee bean sacks hung up and pottery around the shop. They have a drink called the Horchatte and the Chocolate Maya that I will have to try soon. I ordered the open face Mollete which has refried beans, mozzarella cheese, pico, and avocado.  Pico was nice and fresh and the avocado was creamy. However, I would like to see more Mexican inspired menu items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've heard great comments about the cafe from friends and family so I decided on this location for a work meeting.  I ordered the Maya Chocolate and a croissant turkey sandwich with ranchero sauce. The sandwich was smaller than I expected for the cost but tastily microwaved.  It was cold in the cafe but it doesn't help that WI has had negative degrees for temps lately. Each time the door opened, a rush of cold air came in. We kept our coats on our laps throughout our 2-hour meeting but the location served its purpose as a decent meeting spot."}
{"text":"Nomnomnom. Oscar, who appeared to be the barista, cook, and waiter, was super friendly and patient while I perused the somewhat limited menu and asked lots of questions. Ended up getting the salad and the drink of the day, a salted caramel mocha. So yummy. Nice mix of fresh greens with sliced chicken and a delicious spicy and smoky chipotle dressing. Husband had the breakfast burrito and a mocha maya. Had a good kick of spice but not too much to be overwhelming. He Loved the toasted burrito that kept all the goodness contained. The mocha maya was spot on as well. We both got an extra shot of espresso in our drinks which kept them from being too sweet and were surprised how smooth they still were. No bitterness. Just creamy sweet coffee bean deliciousness"}
{"text":"Was quite a delightful experience. The Spanish music threw me off at first (even some Spanish food places don't play Spanish music) but was actually a very nice touch to the place. Was kinda dead when I walked in which is a shame because their coffee is actually really good. I'd rather help out the smaller guys than go to Starbucks but that's just me. Didn't try the food but I'm sure it's good all in itself considering it's homemade unlike your bigger coffee chains. Being the smaller type food place I expected good service, good coffee/food, good atmosphere, prices, and presentation (key factors of being a successful business in my opinion) and this place hit all of those except I felt as though the presentation could have been more Spanish related. Other than that if you want a good cup of coffee and want to give these guys business please do. We more places like this in Madison. P.S. me being a fat guy...quesadillas are the key to my heart"}
{"text":"Great place discovered via Yelp while visiting Madison.  Super friendly staff, good coffee and delicious breakfast sandwich (the Maya).  Went out of my way on my last day to stop for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. Independently owned- each time I have been in, the owner has been behind the counter giving fast, friendly service. Coffee is great and they have a small selection of treats. Also a small kids play area."}
{"text":"Horchatte's are the bomb! After being in Wisconsin for 7 days, I found myself at Cafe Maya 4 out of those 7. Had an oil change at the Toyota dealership up the street, when I first found this gem.  I absolutely love their horchata. I wish other restaurants would take some notes on their recipe. I fell in love with the horchatte as well, but ordered it wrong (how? I know) a few times, so I finally got it down: 20oz, ICED, horchatte, TO GO. I got it hot once, which was yummy, but I like it cold better.   I have had their croissants and sandwiches a few times and they were good, but nothing special. They would be a lot better if they used a different type of meat. I was super turned off with ordering food after my pesto turkey sandwich looked like it had the cheapest circled oscar Meyer turkey slice. 3 stars. Deli style meat, pleaaaaase.   Such a cute and welcoming cafe with tons of seating and great customer service.  Definitely will be coming back for the heavenly 5 star horchata and horchattes."}
{"text":"I really wanted to this place, been three times recently. They never have the food actually available (toaster/panini press/waffle iron not working) and the place is usually somewhat empty. Cappuccinos are basically hot milk with some coffee and look white. Bakery items are sparse and not very fresh. Barista has headphones and takes them out only when you order. Overall I'm sure nice people are behind the place but I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was very much impressed with this cafe shop. I ordered a croissant sandwich and it was perfect. Very tasty, with scrambled eggs, avocado and pesto. They seemed to have other good  breakfast treats there. I gotta stop there more often. I recommend it if you want to kick back during your day .   Really nice"}
{"text":"For a grad student that lives in this particular area of town, having a coffee shop has been a godsend! I come in quite often to grade and I have nothing but positive things to say about this place. The staff and owner have been nothing but excellent. I have enjoyed all of my orders. And they serve breakfast and lunch all day long! Some of the other reviews were a bit harsh--not enough of this or too much of that. Relax a bit and just enjoy! I'm so happy to have a coffee shop in town with a Latin vibe and with specialty drinks and food not offered at other locations."}
{"text":"I like to frequent a place for quite a while before placing a review. I've been here several times in the last 6 months . This has been an excellent Cafe with great tasting coffee lots of beverage options and surprisingly really good food. It's tough to get good food at a cafe, from my experience. But these guys know how to do it right. The flavors are amazing and the quality of food is top-notch. Great customer service, free wifi Oh and they have awesome horchata!  Love love love"}
{"text":"Cute, clean cafe at Whitney & Odana with friendly, prompt service.  My Lavender Chai was lovely and fragrant, and husband's Caramel Frappe was balanced and well-blended.  Breakfast sandwiches--veggie croissant and breakfast bagel--were tasty.  Would have loved for the croissant and bagel to be a bit crispier, but the flavor combos were good.  Lemon poppy seed muffin and blueberry scone tasted fresh and homemade.  Next time I will definately try their horchata."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and helpful. Oscar, the owner, is very personable and always smiling. The bakery items are decent - I'd recommend a chocolate croissant--They'll even heat it up for you! Scones were pretty tough to bite into.   Came to spend the rainy afternoon here and was disappointed to find out that they only have two outlets, both of which are two-prong connections and I only had a three-prong connection. I had to ask staff where the outlets were because I couldn't find them - they happily pointed them out to me. But, again, only two of them. I would not consider this place to be a good study location unless you're the first to snag the outlet and you have the right adapter.   Coffee isn't anything spectacular, just regular coffee. I like the mason jar mugs they use. I'm confused on the sizing because I've gotten both a medium and a large and they seem to be the same size.   Nice place for a meeting or coffee date. Hopefully they'll have some outdoor seating in the summer - the patio is big and beautiful.   My biggest qualm with this cafe are the hours! It is always the first cafe to pop into my head, until I remember that it's only open until 5pm. There have been more than a handful of times that I would have gone to this cafe to work, but it closes so early that I have had to go somewhere else.   Update: They have good wifi and have added another outlet near the window seating. Again, this is a two-prong outlet extension cord.   It's a good place for light lunch. My favorite is the Maya Sandwich. I would've taken a picture, but I ate it so quickly. Went out of my way to get it"}
{"text":"This coffee shop opened up down the road from my work and my coworkers and I are very pleased on the quality of the coffee and the deliciously healthy breakfast and lunch options.  The house salad dressing is so tasty!  The atmosphere is pretty, clean, quiet and welcoming and the local artwork on the walls changes frequently so it is exciting to see what's new when I walk in.  They also sell some Mexican handcrafts including hand painted mugs which are hard to find.    Any place can sell coffee and food, but the staff here is exceptional.  They are friendly and really seem to care about your day.  As a regular, I have witnessed that they learn their frequent customers' names and orders have been known to start their drinks when they see them pull up into the lot in case they are in a hurry!    The other rarity is that the owners have created a quite welcoming atmosphere for business people, students, as well as parents.  They have a quite section for kiddos to get imaginative so parents can enjoy a moment of silence or share a puzzle building session with their child.  The \"horchatte\" and mocha maya are uniquely tasty drinks, that I recommend, but the standard cup of piping hot maya blend Joe is a daily staple for me and my co-workers.  The breakfast burrito, almond croissant, and maya sandwich or salad are my go-to's, with the mollete, and pesto feta sandwich as a close second. Provecho!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a really delicious breakfast burrito while studying in this quiet cafe. It has all the warmth of a cozy coffee shop great for a place to study and drink away your coffee. I really enjoyed the staff and that they were intent on ensuring all my needs were met with in their establishment. I truly would recommend this place to my friends and colleagues for a place to come and enjoy the company. I will be back many more times to continue trying out the food and get my studying on."}
{"text":"Cafe Maya is the third or fourth iteration of this space that I've been in. The first thing I remember is a case of fancy chocolates in the back left corner, then multiple varieties of hot chocolate, then gourmet grilled cheese, then a regular cafe, and finally Eight Seasons Grille (memorable for a carrot side dish that had some hysterical name like carrot explosion or death carrots).   Cafe Maya has gone back to the space's roots and offers cafe drinks with a twist, a pastry case, and some breakfast and lunch items. The space itself is cozy with a warm, orangey-brown paint on the walls and plenty of seating. When I arrived at 5 pm there was only one other table in use; during my stay another table came in.   I ordered the horchata, and the barista was kind in clarifying that I wanted the horchata, not the horchatte - a blend of horchata and a latte. I was surprised to find my horchata served warm; I've never encountered that and the effect was like drinking warmed Cinnamon Toast Crunch milk. It was a little too thin and sweet for me, and there was a solid quarter inch of cinnamon sediment at the bottom of my cup when I finished. It wasn't bad by any means, but if you can have caffeine the horchatte is probably the way to go. I think the coffee would do a nice job of balancing their take on horchata.   Other notes: + the barista was kind, helpful, and meticulous + the items in the pastry case looked amazing - they have a sandwich menu, but it appears to only be for lunch (thwarting my plans for a light dinner) - they close at 7 PM, so folks in that neighborhood still have to hike to State St or the Square for nighttime studying or coffee dates  I'll have to give them another try earlier in the day - wifi was strong and it was a pleasant place to work, I'd just like to explore more of their menu."}
{"text":"I like to explore, so I crossed town to visit Cafe Maya (which is oddly located near a bunch of car dealerships, but I guess that's Odana Road for you) after hearing a friend talk about their breakfast sandwiches.   I ordered an elaborate iced German chocolate cake latte (their special of the day), and their run-of-the-mill breakfast sandwich for a delightful post-hangover, party of one brunch.   The sandwich took kind of a long time to make, but while I waited I read one of the many newspapers they provide customers. Once my order was done, I sat in one of their chairs outside (note that they have a wide variety of seating both in- and outside the cafe) and ate one incredibly fresh sandwich.   Ultimately, I don't know if I will be back just because the location was kind of a hastle and I wasn't blown away, but it was a nice experience that deserves four stars."}
{"text":"The staff was nice but food is not good quality .  I ordered waffle , it taste just like holiday inn breakfast we made by ourselves . My son ordered bakery , there are so many small flies inside  The only special is they use jar for coffee .  Will not go back again cos food is so good ."}
{"text":"First visit and it was so pleasant! Had the Maya salad and the peach smoothie and they were delicious! Staff was super friendly! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"So glad this place stayed a coffee shop. The owner is always very friendly and patient when explaining the different drinks to me. My favorite hot drink is the 'Horchatte'! The owner recommended it and I am completely obsessed with it now! My new favorite hot drink!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the attentive counter staff, but not the coziest coffee shop compared to others.  I had a Groupon to use up so I ordered some food to go.  They don't have their food menu posted, but have printed copies near the register.  I tried their pesto feta sandwich and the maya salad.  The sandwich was fine, pretty average especially for $8 - it does come with a tiny side of mixed greens.  The salad was listed on the menu for $7, but they charged me $9 instead.  I questioned this and they said they just charge the same for the maya sandwich and the salad: $9.  Okay....so maybe update your menu? That annoyed me.  I'll agree with a couple other reviews; the meat they use seems to be higher end deli meat and the pastry case looks a bit sparse.  I can't comment on the drinks, but the prices looked high."}
{"text":"Google Maps lead me to visit this cafe during a visit to the area.  Adjacent parking a little tight during mid-day.  It's a small cafe with a limited selection of food, but the coffee was excellent. I was a little disappointed with my sandwich;  Chipotle or Qdoba would have been preferred.  But the service and ambiance was five star quality."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place for coffee and food alike. Cozy, but well lit atmosphere, unique menu, very friendly staff. Definitely try the horchata latte served either hot or cold. This is my favorite place for coffee. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wonderful concept!    Cafe Maya provides a fabulous spot for gathering in the near West side (corner of Odana and Whitney); they serve Mexican-themed coffee drinks and food (pastries, sandwiches, soups) with table seating and sofa styles and wireless access.  I've tried both their signature Mocha Maya and a regular latte. I do think they could use a stronger flavor (I didn't get too much chocolate or coffee flavor in Mocha Maya), though I'm eager to try more of their offerings and will update."}
{"text":"We have been going here every other Saturday for almost a year now. Why? The coffee and white chocolate Mochas are fantastic, but their breakfast burrito is to die for! It has a great blend of amazing chorizo, cheese, egg, and a salsa to dip it into. It's fantastic! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I wish I worked closer to Cafe Maya as I would go there much more than I do. The coffee and espresso drinks always are always fresh and very good. They also have some unique drinks such as the Maya Mocha which has a little bit of spice to it. It is nice to try something new instead of the normal coffee or latte.   The service here is also always very friendly and fast. I would recommend this cafe to any coffee lover who is looking for something more local and less big corporate coffee. It really is such a gem!"}
{"text":"Located in a the former Victor Allen's Coffee on the busy intersection of Odana Road and Whitney Way, Cafe Maya opened with little fanfare last month.  After perusing their Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/Cafe-Maya-678670192233687/timeline) and determining their served up a variety of sandwiches, pastries and breakfast foods, I decided to pay them a visit.  While the food is still a work in progress, the redesigned interior is definitely worth checking out if you are looking for a welcoming space to hang on the West Side.  While I recognized the layout of the former tenant of the space, the new occupant completely reinvigorated the interior.  The walls, which received a fresh coat of taupe paint, now feature vividly colored artwork that immediately caught my eye as I entered the restaurant.  Coupled with the accent lighting, I initially thought I stepped into an art gallery.  While the shop could use more comfy chairs, there is plenty of available seating and has a strong Wi-Fi signal.  The Mexican-themed music that gently played over the speakers added to the relaxed ambiance.  In the summer months, there is an outdoor patio.  For those of you looking for a location to set up a base of mobile operations on the West Side, Café Maya is a solid option.   In addition to the usual variety of hot and cold coffee-based drinks, the shop also offers other tempting beverage options like fruit smoothies, horchata, coffee floats and Mexican hot chocolate.  The pastry selections, though somewhat picked over when I arrived in the early afternoon, include freshly baked croissants, cookies and scones. In addition to waffles and oatmeal, Café Maya offers a variety of sandwiches on sourdough bread or croissants.  I elected to go with the eponymous Maya Sandwich (Chicken, smoked bacon, mozzarella, avocado, red onions, tomatoes with a chipotle ranch dressing) for $9, which included a small spinach salad lightly dressed with a bright honey mustard vinaigrette.  The thinly sliced bread had a difficult time containing the bounty of fillings generously supplied by the kitchen.  While the bread did offer plenty of flavor, the sandwich would have benefited from a thicker slice and more time in the toaster.  The chicken was moist, but needed a dash of salt to amp up the flavor.  While the chipotle ranch provided a pleasant kick, the rest of the ingredients felt like standard, institutional grade quality.  Especially disappointing was the super thin bacon that provided almost no smoked flavor.  Overall, my sandwich was a work in progress, but there is potential as the kitchen fine tunes its offerings.  Still, it's far superior to any of the chain sandwich shops that have proliferated on the West Side.  I also purchased a blueberry scone to go.  While it did not have much of an exterior crunch, the inside was moist, tender and flakey with a subtle natural sweetness.    I'd be remiss if I didn't mention my über enthusiastic server.  While Café Maya providers counter service, it didn't preclude him from checking in on me from time to time.  He also provided a thorough summary of the sandwich offerings when I mentioned this was my first visit to the restaurant.  While my sandwich was a solid three stars, the relaxed setting, the attentive service and the fine baked goods push the overall rating to four stars."}
{"text":"Had a bit of a slow start, but this location of Cafe Maya seems to be hitting its stride. As far as coffee goes I don't trend to stray from the basics, but my boyfriend loves their cappuccino!   This neighborhood needed a coffee shop and the last one didn't stick. I like the changes Cafe Maya made like the layout. They also have water, loyalty punch cards, and merchandise!  I am taking off one star because I feel like they could do more with the food. I'm pretty sure part or all of my meal was microwaved. I'd like to see a bit more attention to detail in that department otherwise, this might be a coffee-only place for me."}
{"text":"I love this cafe! They are always so friendly and helpful and are willing to make you anything! They have free trade coffee, awesome Spanish music playing, amazing staff, and a great atmosphere! They're the perfect spot to have a cup of coffee, do some work, meet with friends or whatever you want to do! Although the parking lot was in turmoil for a bit, it's beautiful and smooth now! I highly recommend this cafe to everyone! It's a little bit pricey but so worth it for the service and amazing drinks!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a sweet spot for coffee on Odana Road.  I decided to stop in after reading a review and found Café Maya everything they said it was.  The staff and service is great. They offered to bring our order to the table.  I tried the Café de olla and went back for a second cup. This is an interesting blend of spices to coffee and fear of it being too sweet just didn't happen.  I would give them five stars if they pastry options weren't running low for a late morning stop.  The rest of the menu looks interesting and I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe in Cafe Maya! The decor is simple, but very different from most coffee shops I've seen in the area, with burlap coffee bean bags lying around and photos of Mexico. There's also art on the walls - and it seems like the local artists featured rotate.  For breakfast, I had to try the molletes. I had never had this particular dish before but it sounded tasty with cheese and beans atop some special bread. Unfortunately, they were out of the bread, but the woman serving us offered to make molletes using tortillas. Yum! My only complaint was that at $8, the price was a bit steep. Maybe with the bread the price would have made more sense to me. My husband wanted something simple and healthy, so he chose oatmeal. He was able to pick toppings he wanted, which he liked, and it was $3, which we thought was great.  Both employees were extremely accommodating. Halfway through our time at Cafe Maya, we realized we were running a risk of being late to an appointment, so we changed our order to be \"to go.\" Although it was a bit of a challenge to pack up the molletes, they did it with no hesitation. I really appreciated their working with us!  We ran out the doors with our huge green teas, and got to enjoy them for the rest of the day in between errands. I definitely want to try Cafe Maya again!"}
{"text":"Cafe Maya, the newest coffee shop in this location. Not too much has changed, although the inside seems a bit more spacious and cozy. They offer all of your typical coffee drinks and prices are reasonable. They have a couch and a large chair as well as around 10 wooden tables with chairs. They offer a food menu for breakfast and lunch, but not dinner. They also have a rewards punch card for loyal customers. This place is usually pretty quiet and chill and not too busy, so a good place to go for some casual studying. There is no parking lot, so you have to hope to find a street parking spot available nearby which is the main limitation if you are driving. Overall a nice little coffee shop."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was even better! Had the Maya Sandwich and it will keep me coming back. Also loved that my iced tea was brewed on the spot, so fresh! Will bring my husband with me next time. :) I work nearby so I will be here often!"}
{"text":"I'm glad another coffee shop replaced the old Victor Allen's. It within walking distance to my work and we always used to have our work meetings here.   The coffee is OK it's not any better then other places but its coffee. Its more expensive then Victor's was and more expensive then Starbucks but I like to support local businesses.  They re-did the inside nicely with new paint and furniture. I like the art and they change it every once in a while.  They get their baked goods from Madison Sourdough. But either don't they order enough or MSD doesn't have enough to order but they are always our of stuff by 9-930ish. I haven't have their lunch sandwiches yet but they sound good."}
{"text":"This was a Groupon purchase of mine. I had never been to Cafe Maya before even though I live a few minutes away. A friend had told me about it, so I wanted to go!  I already forget the name of the croissant sandwich I got.. I think it's the Maya one. I loved it!   I also ordered a soy mocha because I'm still too scared to try Mexican hot chocolate (there's a Maya mocha made with that). I love that it came in a glass mug - really speaks to the millennial in me, huh.  My SO ordered a quesadilla. It was so yummy. The cheese was melty and tortilla was toasted just enough."}
{"text":"It takes some ingenuity to stand out in a such a sea of coffee shops, but Café Maya does just that with their fresh, Mexican-inspired take on coffee and locally sourced baked goods.  In addition to the traditional latte, cappuccino and espresso drinks expected of a java joint, Café Maya serves a few signature drinks that are in line with their Mexican-inspired concept.  I ordered the Café de Olla, which was described via their Facebook page as a mix of coffee grounds, cinnamon, orange peel and a touch of sugar. The result is a cup resembling black coffee, yet rich with cinnamon and citrus notes. The sweetness is subtle but the flavors from the spices and orange shine through enough so added sugar wasn't needed in my cup.  Unique drinks aside, Café Maya also serves baked goods and heartier food options--waffles, oatmeal, sandwiches, soups, quesadillas...  Arrive early for the greatest selection of bakery items, as the display case empties out quickly and is limited once afternoon hits. I was able to snatch the last double chocolate chip muffin and found out that Café Maya sources their baked items from local favorite French bakery around the corner, Le Petit Croissant. The sugar of the muffin was a perfect fit for the conservatively sweet Cafe de Olla, all about that balance.  The environment at the cafe is welcoming thanks to a staff that goes beyond the expected etiquette of a traditional coffee shop. Workers walk around to tables checking on customers and holding conversations with its older base of patrons who frequent the shop.  I'm intrigued by the Mocha Maya and Horchatte drinks, so I'm likely to revisit the shop if I make it back to the west side!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that this place offers a version of horchata latte, which first cropped up in town a year or so ago at a brunch place downtown. Unfortunately the version at Cafe Maya is incredibly disappointing. It tasted only vaguely like cinnamon, and mostly just tasted like watered down coffee. On top of that, this was ridiculously expensive at $5 for a medium. Very friendly service and nice decor can't make up for the overpriced poor quality drink that is available in an amazing version for only $4 elsewhere."}
