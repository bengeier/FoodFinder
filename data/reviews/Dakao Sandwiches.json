{"text":"With a crisp, golden crust containing a fluffy white inside, the baguettes from Dakao are the perfect vessel for their banh mi.  Despite their slender appearances, the sandwiches have the right proportion of bread, pickled veggies, meat filling, and pate. My order is usually the #1 House Special (which has a few kinds of cold cuts) or the #6 BBQ Pork. I love how each ingredient is just so fresh that you can taste it in each bite.  Dakao doubles as a deli by selling spring rolls, fried sesame balls, and other Vietnamese foods. Among their drink and dessert offerings, you'll find that they have the traditional iced coffee and che. I have yet to try them, because I'm afraid that I'll butcher their names while ordering.  Upon walking in, you'll notice there's no place to sit and that it's primarily for take-out. If anything, you can drive down to Desert Breeze Park on a nice day to have a quick picnic. As a general rule of thumb, you're better off using cash at a small Asian establishment like this.  Buy five sandwiches, get one free? You could try the whole menu with that deal!"}
{"text":"Went to this place today, ordered 6 banh mi and we had to wait for 1hr n there was only 1 person ahead of us. they didnt even have the decency to let us know that they were out of banh mi"}
{"text":"Omg. This place looks so sketchy from the inside and outside but the banh mi was delicious!!!! The bread is amazing. Doesn't look like your typical banh mi bread, but their bread are homemade. Delicious. It was so good I couldn't post a pic. I ordered number one with a sunny side up egg on it. Must try it."}
{"text":"A tiny nondescript sandwich place with about 8 types of sandwiches. I had the grilled pork and a combination sandwich with a hot vietnamese coffee. The only complaint I have is that the grilled pork was not actually grilled, but it was well seasoned. The bread is the best I've had. It was light and crispy on the surface and pillowy soft inside. They have a sign outside stating that they bake their bread every 45 minutes and I believe it. There's only one small table inside, so it's built for take-out."}
{"text":"We ordered quite a few sandwiches here before heading out to Grand Canyon. I was pleasantly surprised by their vegetarian sandwiches. They were very accommodating in preparing one sandwich without sausage. Sandwiches were very savory and with the fresh vegetables and fresh jalapeños.  Now I feel like trying other Vietnamese sandwich spots to satisfy my cravings. I would definitely recommend this. It is a small hole-in-the-wall place. Mostly suited for pickup order. Price is very reasonable. A lot better than the fast food on the strip or casinos."}
{"text":"Freshly baked bread and real grilled pork, not the highly processed meat you get at Lee's. Just the right amount of jalapeno to give your sandwich the extra kick. This is going to be my new go to place when I'm craving for banh mi."}
{"text":"I'm from San Jose and recently moved here to Henderson. It has been difficult for me to find really yummy Vietnamese food out here in the desert. I was craving banh mi and saw that this place had great reviews on Yelp. When I got my banh mi cha, I was at first surprised by how small it looked. I am also not a fan of the thin baguette and like the fluffy kind, but the bread was crunchy and did not hurt my gums like other places. The sandwich was filling and for the price, it was a good deal."}
{"text":"Best little Vietnamese sandwich place in town. Beats Lee's for sure. I liked that they use traditional French bread versus baguets. They have different little pre-made to go dishes, like bun quon, spring rolls, sticky rice, rice cakes sweet and savory types. Owner is always friendly and nice. This place is a pick up and go place, so no place to sit and eat. Like that they offer the but 5 get 1 free on the sandwiches."}
{"text":"a good deal and a great sandwich? also the cashier is always super friendly and cute :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place been coming here for years!! Bestttt i ever had #lovemesomesweetporksandwiches"}
{"text":"I must confess, I am a Vietnamese Sandwich expert.  I don't use the word \"expert\" lightly.  Unbeknown to me, my parents have trained me into being a Vietnamese Sandwich expert or a banh mi expert.  I know my banh mi.  In my household, this is like searching for the holy grail.    When I was growing up in midwest, there's hardly any Vietnamese restaurants, much less, a banh mi store.  We used to drive 4 hours across the border into Toronto just for banh mi.  My parents would try every single banh mi shop in Toronto and when we find that perfect one...guess how many we would buy?  Not 5 or 10 but hundreds.  I kid you  not... Literally hundreds.  A good portion was for us but they were also for other family members and close friends.  The Vietnamese people in midwest are banh mi fanatics.     My parents are still on the hunt for banh mi.  The several thousands that we've eaten are still not enough for their ferocious banh mi appetite.  Whenever we travel these days, they are always trying out banh mi shops... still hoping and keeping their eyes out for a good banh mi.    So what does all this background have to do with Dakao sandwiches?  You would think I have found the holy grail by typing all that background info but no I just wanted you to know something about me.... :)  Dakao sandwiches or banh mi is pretty good for Las Vegas.  I've tried the ones at Hue Thai, SF supermarket and Thanh Phoung by UNLV.  Dakao tastes way better.  It really helps that their bread is so fresh.  I speak to the owners in Vietnamese and my filling on the dac biet or #1 is always freshly.  The pate and homemade cold cuts are not gamy and seasoned as they should be for cha (Viet ham).   Their pickled veggies can used a bit more seasoning.  I like it more sour but that's just a personal preference.  They don't compare to the banh mi shops in Little Saigon but it's pretty darn close and this place serves authentic banh mi.    My favorite thing here is not the banh mi but the banh cuon.  Banh cuon are rice flour rolls with ground pork fillings.  I really like the texture of the rice flour of the banh cuon.  If one knows or have very attempted to make them, it's really hard to get the texture of the rice flour right.  They make it very nicely here.  In fact, it's better then my mom's banh cuon.  But don't tell her that.. it'll just be our secret."}
{"text":"Legit banh mi. Dirt cheap.  And omg the bread is so good. Stop by and pick up super cheap baguettes for dinner even if you aren't interested in banh mi."}
{"text":"Food: The banh mi sandwiches were ok at $3.65 each.  They were very thin on the meat. The pickled carrots and daikon were not pickled.  The bread was good.  I also ordered the pork buns at $2.00 each (high price)- they only had frozen ones, no fresh ones at the time. The glutinous rice/black eyed peas dessert with coconut was good- the portions were smaller then I normally observe from other places and the price a little higher $2.50 per cup.  Parking: Negative.  There is a parking lot at this strip mall sandwich shop but you'll be lucky to find a spot. I observed a gentleman selling cars from this lot that is meant for the stores. (He showed 4 Lexus to 2 different customers while I was parked)"}
{"text":"Being told I have to spend 8 whole dollars to purchase with my credit card is music to my penny pinching ears!!!  For 8 dollars even, I got a Grilled Pork banh mi, a Chicken banh mi and two canned drinks.  Everything was delicious! What made this visit really nice was the friendliness of the regular customers.  One lady recommended the House Special.  I know what I am getting next time! :D"}
{"text":"If your looking for good banh-mi and Vietnamese coffee this is your spot. $3.00 for any banh-mi, $2.50 for iced Vietnamese coffee. They have numerous Vietnamese desserts and extras in a deli case. Service was friendly and pretty fast. I came at lunch and was in and out within 15 minutes. You can pay with a deit card if you would like but most people bring cash. Also, buy 5 and get one free."}
{"text":"I've had several vegetarian vietnamese sandwiches in Vegas and I must say that this is my favorite. Their veggie sandwich is super flavorful. I loved it so much I ordered another one to eat on the way home. I only rated this place four stars because the place and location looks worn down. They only have one table with 2 or 3 chairs so this is definitely not a place to dine in with a big family. Overall, I really like this place and has the best veggie banh mi in Vegas."}
{"text":"Buy five sandwiches and you get one sandwich for free!!!.Now, that's a deal. It gets even better because the sandwiches are cheap. The grilled pork sandwich that I like costs $3....you crunch the numbers. It's comes.down.to.$2.50 a.sandwich. Great deal!!!!! What do you think? It's not the best banh mi place but I would rate it at a close second. Dakao is now one of my favorite spots.on the Spring Mountain Asian fare."}
{"text":"Best vietnamese sandwiches place in Las Vegas, 10 times better than Lee's Sandwiches. Bread is very soft and has good flavor. Good price also."}
{"text":"My fiance is quite the connoisseur when it comes to vietnamese food.  We've been to many banh mi (sandwich) locations throughout Vegas and he, and I, really like this place.  Compared to others, they give a decent amount of meat and the flavor is good.  It's a whole in the wall place, so don't expect a fine dining atmosphere."}
{"text":"Special sandwich doesn't look fresh and delicious at all. Plus the cashier realized we were visitors from another state and charged us $6 instead of $5.75 (he just rounded the whole order himself) well, 25¢ is not that much to us but let be honest when you come to business."}
{"text":"So affordable... I love their banh mi! My favorite place to go in the west coast! I always go here whenever I am in Vegas visiting"}
{"text":"A Vietnamese bartender from The Plaza put me on this place.  I've been here 3-4 times and the sandwiches are great.  The bread is super fresh and the combination of flavors is unlike anything I've eaten before.  I don't know what all is in the #1, and maybe I don't want to know.  Speaking of which, I can't say I'm a big fan of the nem chua.  Fermented pork.  Ugh."}
{"text":"the gf was hounding me to pick up some apple fritters at Ronald Donuts for Sunday \" Brunch.\"  In that I planned to spend most of the day watching football ( tis the season ) I felt it was the least I can do for her so off to Ronald's I go !  In that I was going to grow roots on a couch in about an hour, a little pre-planning for my football snacks - I'm on Spring Mountain, figuring to buy some sammies - I choose Dakao and Roma across the street.  Dakao is busy - I order the BBQ pork banh Mi ( $3.25) - slight increase in price since my last visit.  Sammie is prepared quickly, out the door I go quickly to hit Roma across street.  I did notice the sammie looked somewhat smaller than the last time I was there  Half time of first game, time to nosh - yes, the sandwiches have definitely shrunk but still a decent amount of filling - perfect ratio of veggies and meat.  Overall, a tasty sammie !   pics attached"}
{"text":"Great bahn mi sandwiches and great prices! This is a pickup and go place, no dining area.  We also had the yucca cakes which were really, really good."}
{"text":"T and I came for cheap, tasty sandwiches. We got the cheap part. Less than $4. T wanted to get the roast pork, but they had already run out by noon. So instead, T had the beef steak, and I had the veggie. The beef steak was good, but the veggie wasn't... I wasn't sure what I was eating, but I'm pretty sure there was mushrooms in my sandwich. They tasted like they were canned. I also found something in my sandwich that looked like a mushroom piece, but with a bunch of roots / short black strings that looked like hair sticking out of the mushroom. That was reeeeallly  unappetizing. If the veggie sandwich was better and not so disgusting (try some tofu or something, please, Dakao!), I think I would've given 3 or 4 stars."}
{"text":"$8 minimum for credit card use. Sandwhiches were so-so. Coffee was good. Spring rolls and sticky rice were good."}
{"text":"I go here once in a while. I like their banh bao (steamed pork buns), and their sandwiches. Except the bread of the sandwich, it's hard and bruises my gums."}
{"text":"Simple,  clean, and fresh \"fast food.\" Best deal in town for banh mi  sandwiches.  Price ranging from 3 to 5 bucks.    Definitely a must try for those looking for something quick and tasty."}
{"text":"Dirty, filthy counter and floor. Rude cashier, probably cause we're not vietnamese, or because we interupted the conversation she was having with her friend that was hanging out at the counter. The one table inside was filled with someones trash, it was never cleared. The two tables outside also had a ton of trash on them, so we took them to go. If hard crusty week old bread, with wilted veggies and dried out meat is your thing, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Very tasty banh mi. Little skimpy on the meat tho. Friendly counter guy. Cheap and easy."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch and was amazed at how good the sandwich was. I have no experience with banh mi but it will differently NOT be my last trip there!"}
{"text":"Small little place in the corner of the plaza, next to Sunfood Market.   Best place to buy meats to make your own Banh mi at home. Price has rose up a little since the last time i bought it but still not too bad. Approx $6 each roll of meat now. They also sell banh cuon, nem, banh mi made in store, their own bread, and some other things.   Cash or credit card is accepted."}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese sandwiches for a low price. I don't think you'll find better sandwiches for 3.50 in all of Vegas!  The Banh Mi Dac Biet was very flavorful, and was your typical DB sandwich. The pate complimented the other meats well.The grilled pork sandwich was also quite good. My only complaint is that there should definitely be more vegetables (cucumber and pickled daikon and carrots). The sandwich is a bit dry without them.  Cafe sua da (iced coffee) was strong and delicious, just how l like it."}
{"text":"Really solid Bo bia and banh mi xiu mai. Reminds me of the banh mi shops back home in OC"}
{"text":"House Special Dac Biet is where it's at! It's the only thing I've ever ordered here, because it's good enough for repeat visits. The price can't be beat: $3.25 for a footlong sandwich on crusty, fresh bread. And they DO accept credit cards, without a minimum!  Interior is plain and reminiscent of a convenience store, with a single dine-in table and a few refrigerators of unlabeled products to buy, but I just stick to the sandwiches. Signage outside indicates their bread is fresh made every few hours."}
{"text":"My wife and I just love this place.  During our weekly Vietnamese shopping, we always try to swing by this place to grab our sandwiches or Bun Cuon.  I think this is a family run business.  I have met both the husband and wife.  They are very nice people.  Funny thing is that as many times that we come here, we do not honestly know their names.    Environment, well, don't look to dine in.  This is more or less purely take-out.    Foodwise, the dac biet and grilled pork sandwiches are pretty good.  The prices use to be $2.50, but now it is like $3... i guess it comes with the times.    Also, we usually get the Bun Cuon.  I have to admit, the fish sauce does tastes like water (my wife always have to add more fish sauce at home).  Otherwise, the price and food is pretty good.  Overall, the price and value of this place is right on."}
{"text":"Damn good Banh Mi for $4. I usually come here to pick up some sandwiches for the plane ride back when I am in Vegas. Small, mom and pop unpretentious shop that makes a killer footlong ish for $4. I paid $12 for 2 dac biet and 1 thit nuong. Bread is nice and soft with a good crust and the meat and pate were on point. Long review not needed- get your banh mi here for the plane or regular enjoyment!"}
{"text":"Oh yes! This is what Bánh mì is all about!  - Decent quality and size - Right balance between meat and vegetables - Only $3.25"}
{"text":"A good banh mi is better than most other sandwiches any day of the week.   Took the advice of fellow yelper, resident Vegas foodie and my favorite dental entrepreneur...My T and popped in to Dakao to get my fix.  Let's focus on the sandwich because the ambience leaves much to be desired, but with most businesses of this sort, it's par for the course.  I ordered my usual #1. Why? Because it's the same at EVERY Vietnamese joint. It's got butter, patè, and some cold cuts that most people probably wouldn't eat. Along with pickled vegetables, fresh jalapeños and cilantro. Sounds like every other banh mi, right? Well yeah...except the bread here is dope AF.  It has that crunchy, crumbly goodness on the outside and that soft luxurious interior. Ok the interior sounded like a car commercial. But I'm telling you...the BREAD here is what makes this stand out and I AM willing to come back over and over again.  Last thing...if you suspect this place has health department issues, it doesn't. I checked. It actually has an A rating with no demerits per the SNHD website. So suck it haters.   Yeah...I was impressed too."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to an awesome vietnamese sandwich.  They claimed the bread was made every 45 mins but mine was definitely hard and old.  Still... The sandwich itself was good and the spices were sharper than Lees Sandwiches which made up in part for the stale bread. Service could also be better."}
{"text":"If Dakao was a song, they'd be my jam on repeat. Their banh mi is the bomb, and more specifically, their baguette bread for the banh mi is my fav. The problem with the place down the street is that their bread hurts my gums and is too hard. The problem with the other other place down the street is that the bread is too doughy with no crustiness. Dakao makes their baguettes juuuuust right. It is perfectly crusty on the outside and oh so fluffy on the inside. I order the #1 banh mi dac biet (cold cuts, pate, pickled vegetables and some sort of amazing crack-like mayo) and sometimes I even order a couple more to eat the next day with hubby. Eating 1 day old banh mi just now totally prompted this review. I take the pickled veggies and other greens out and store in the fridge. Then I toast the sandwich sans the vegetables for 3 minutes and then put it all back  together. Could the banh mi be ant more amazing the day after? Yes, yes, yes! Glorious! For all y'all bread snobs and texture whores out there, Dakao's banh mi should be your jam, too."}
{"text":"I live far from this place. Decided to go out of my way to come here to get some banh mi since this used to be my go to place. I ordered 6 banh mis, 3 of which were supposed to be with the grilled pork. When I got home, I discovered that 3 of them were something else that I didn't even order and that I don't even eat. I decided to give them a call to let them know of the mistake. The lady that took my order picked up the phone and proceeded to tell me that it was MY fault because I ordered it wrong, even when I repeated the order twice and I have never order the banh mi that was erroneously made before since I don't eat it. She was super condescending and needless to say, the customer service is NONEXISTENT. Any mistake they make they'll just try to deny it and blame it on you and not try to offer a solution of any kind.   I now have 3 banh mis that I paid full money for that I won't eat. As a loyal customer who has been going to this place for YEARS, I have to say I won't be coming back here again. And I'll make sure people I know won't be coming back either."}
{"text":"Amazing location for a good and cheap lunch. I tried out their house special sandwich for lunch and it was delicious. The sweet pickles and extra hot sauce made all the flavors come out in every single bite. I did try their bbq pork sandwich as well, and I found it bit sweeter for my taste. If you are in the neighborhood then you have to try out location.   Side Note: They serve meats for u to take home an eat. Also, the prices on sandwiches are very reasonable, $3.50 for a footlong sandwich."}
{"text":"Located in a plaza, this small shop sells some pretty good sandwiches. I tried the BBQ port and the cold cut, and both were really good. I also tried the sticky rice and enjoyed it very much (being Thai, I am a huge stickler about sticky rice), though it was still a little sweet for me. Dakao was able to make 66 sandwiches I needed to pick up for a wedding and broke down the price for me pretty fairly. We only paid for 55, and got 11 free!  The only downside is the price. I live within driving distance from Westminster and Dakao doesn't come close to the prices I normally pay, but I guess that can be attributed to being in Vegas."}
{"text":"This spot pails in comparison to the one in Garden Grove. The exterior and interior areas are DIRTY! It turned me off that I wasn't even willing to eat a Banh Mi Sandwich from this place. My nickname for this spot is Dakaka!"}
{"text":"We went there for banh mi sandwich.  Sandwich bread was not as good as what we are used to having at a typical Vietnamese town store. There are only two tables inside so we ate it in the car.  Also, the ice coffee is horrible.  We would give it a 4 star if the bread was good.  But so so bread and ugh coffee."}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese sandwiches - foot long size for just $3.75+ tax and they take cc!!  Cashier is very friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I love love love this place!!! :). I've been coming here getting bahn-mi for as long I can remember getting bahn-mi in Vegas.   The first time I tried bahn-mi was over 15 years ago in Austin, TX.... And let me tell u.... DaKao rocks even compared to the bank mi I've had in Texas and Cali!!  The bread is always baked fresh and it is just perfectly crispy on the outside with that perfect amount chew on the inside. Such a great compliment to their mayo and pate. Honestly their pate is one of the best I've had ever... Some other places makes theirs a little sweet... Here it is savory and just melts in my mouth!!  I've tried quite a few of their sandwiches and I gotta say it's a toss up between the pork roll and the fried egg with Chinese sausage for me.  But no matter what I get its always been amazing!! :) also they have some specialty items there for sale as well. Rice noodles dishes... Spring rolls with shrimp and pork or sometimes they have it with Vietnamese sausage... I don't know what any of them are called cuz well.... Their English is lacking.... But they do know numbers which is how I normally order. Lol  siopao.... Steamed bun with pork inside with a half a hard boiled egg... Delicious.  Their specialty items change day by day and once they run out they run out so get there early. :). (5/5)  English is a hit or miss. If u are expecting to talk to someone about the different options this might not be the place as normally the ppl working there don't speak English all that great... But normally they serve you with a smile and they are very friendly and the lady that works there remembers me even if I don't come in for months... (5/5)  This is a strictly to go place.  They do have 2 tables... But they were added in the last couple of years.... And the feel of this place is still a to go.  So my recommendation is do what I do... Call ahead.... And pick up your order and go home and eat in the comfort of your home. :).   The flavor here beats Lee's hands down in my book.... I just wished it was closer. But every chance I get... I will be back!! My favorite spot for bahn mi!!!"}
{"text":"So I bought three #6 (marinated pork) to go. There was a lady sitting at the front on her phone, she greeted me, but called a man to help me. The man was kind and gave good service, but why would the lady just sit there? Anyways, as for the sandwich... I've had way better.  The sandwich lacked flavor, meat, and pickled veggies that it didn't peak out of the sandwich. It was kinda upsetting"}
{"text":"Had a bbq pork sandwich. This place is a lot different then what I'm used to. I'm also surprised that the first review was more then six months ago and the place is still pretty empty. the latest addition is a new board for their menu. Anyway back to the food  BBQ Pork Sandwich + it's pretty big  - instead of a normal liver pate that i'm used to this place choose to spread oil and green onion. added a different taste to the sandwich - the pork seasoning wasn't all that great tasted like it was soaked on soy sauce then grilled - it's a bit expensive, san jose got them for 1.50 each buy 2 get 1 free but here it's nearly three bucks - i miss san jose"}
{"text":"My husband called their banh mi dac biet or combination special the best he ever had. Stay tuned for his review. As for me, I can speak to their vegetarian banh mi. And yes, it is also one of the best I've ever had. The long, thin, French style baguette is crisp and fragrant one the outside and stuffed with generous heapings of a salty slaw type concoction. It looks like shredded tofu and something crunchy akin to perhaps bamboo? I wasn't sure, but this mixture was scrumptious. Unlike the horrific, sweet imitation pig skin filling I had in Atlanta, this meatless protein was perfectly salty, not cloyingly sweet, and very umami.  I also loved that the Dakao folks used a lighter hand with the butter. It's definitely there, but it's not so overpoweringly rich as with other banh mi joints.   Their sandwiches are quite affordable at around $3.50 each. Service is okay to friendly, depending on who's there to greet you. (We visited twice, and there was one smaller, younger, moustached guy, who mostly worked in the back and was really nice. The other staff were okay.)  Excellent quality and value. Unfortunately, a good banh mi place is harder to find than you think. Again, thank you, Yelpers for putting this one on our radar."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese sandwiches ever. Problem is they always run out towards the end of the day which says a lot to the amt of volume they do. However, their bread isn't always warm and crispy as it should be at those hrs. Also, they don't always add more veggies when requested by overall great prices and good products"}
{"text":"Absolutely the only place i would get a banh mi in my dear town of Las Vegas. Don't count on a 5 star dinning experience though, this is just your usual grab and go asian joint. DAKAO is the epitome of your tasteful mom and pop shop, a damn hole in the wall that could use some aesthetic remodeling but that's definitely irrelevant to the product delivered! My usual is the dac biet, the number 1. The bread is flaky yet never dry! Im especially particular when it comes to bread. In comparison to the much overrated Lee's sandwiches whose bread is super hard and dry! This place's bread is fresh flaky and moist on the inside. I mean c'mon isn't it safe to say the essence of the Banh Mi lies within the consistency and texture of the bread?! The only \"un-kudos\" for this place (hence the 4 vs 5 stars) is that i wish they'd give more meat, they're a little stingy with their meat but that'll never stop me from detouring here for my Banh mi cravings! Enjoy everyone! :)"}
{"text":"Some are connoisseurs of fine wines. Others can define the origin of a coffee harvest purely from taste. Me? I know my banh mi.  Starting with the basics, the bread here is like a rock. Way too hard and no fluff inside. The veggies don't seem incredibly fresh, especially the pickled carrots and radish. They skimp out on the meat. There really should be a lot more in each sandwich. Also, these sandwiches really should come out at least lukewarm, not cold.  Being a native of LA, I've had a full range of banh mi in my time ranging from the best to the worst. This is definitely below average in that spectrum."}
{"text":"The Skinny: great sammies but everything else is okay (4) it is hole in the wall joint with counter service and it is really a takeout place - there is only a single table to eat at (3) given the quality of the sandwiches and value,  it is our go to place for our banh mi fix (4)  My hubby does not like Vietnamese food in general... with the exception of Dakao sandwiches.  I have always thought that banh mi was a really fusion dish from the get go -  French bread with Vietnamese styled fillings like pickled daikon/carrot, pate,  marinated grilled meats and assorted cold cuts. At Dakao's, it is truly the best representation of both worlds.   For me, the bread has to be legit French baguette which means crunchy and light on the outside, soft on the inside. Dakao's bread fits this description. If you are looking for a soft bread,  this is not the place for you and you will be sorely disappointed.  I love the house special which is the classic cold cuts and pate. The hubs' usual is the grilled pork sandwich which has a nice smoky flavor. I have also tried their grilled pork meatball which is also quite delicious. For a sandwich of this caliber to be less than $4, it is one of my favorite cheap eats in the city.   The only thing about the sandwiches are they need to be eaten ASAP given the delicate bread in combination with moist fillings. So we usually pick these en route back home from a Spring Mountain expedition for groceries.   I also purchase their siobao which are the steamed pork buns with the boiled eggs inside. My only complaint about these are the steamed bun park could be a little less dense. Otherwise they are a nice quick affordable meal for $2 each.   The spring rolls are alright -  there is a little too much rice vermicelli and not enough vegetables for my taste.   If it was just sandwiches, this place would be an easy 4.5 starred joint. But their other stuff is just okay for me so it rounds it down to a 4 starred review."}
{"text":"Few of my med school friends and I came here for a little breakfast and coffee before our afternoon genitals and breast lab. Since there were 5 of us, we were able to get 1 bahn mi free! We tried the 2 chicken, 2 house special, and 2 grilled pork. (Of course, I got 2 sandwiches!) All three were meats were delicious, but the house special stood out the most for me. I have been always hesitant to get the house special because sometimes the \"bologna\" taste can rub me the wrong way sometime and kick in a gag reflex. But here, I liked how the different meats were in good condition, thinly sliced and were in harmony with the other ingredients. I think the quality bahn mi bread is the best in LV. It was crunchy and soft and didn't scrape of the epithelial cells lining my hard palate.  I also bought one of the deli items. It was chinese sausage and egg stuffed with vegetables and wrapped with rice paper. What a great breakfast! It was light, full of flavor, and had protein. I hope I can find out the real name of this dish but I posted a photo just in case you are interested~ Also, I got an iced coffee and it was very standard (sweetened, creamy).   This place isn't like Lee's where you sit down to eat your sandwich. There's one table outside and one inside and they're not fancy or clean. The atmosphere in summary: Type of joint where older immigrant Vietnamese men come to grab some coffee and read their papers.  Lastly, the cashier (owner?) was friendly and helpful in answering any questions we had (i.e. What's in there?). Furthermore he was a jokester! When I asked him to slice the rolls in half, he told me it'd cost $1 per roll to slice them in half! It made me laugh because he couldn't keep a straight face (I like him!).  I'm glad to have finally found a bahn mi spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Good food, good price, quick and easy.  Banh Mi was on point."}
{"text":"I wrote a review before on this place.  Don't know what happened to it though.  Best bahn mi around Vegas."}
{"text":"I've heard fantastic things about the China-town area in Vegas.  It's not super-convenient for me to get to from home or work, so I rarely make the journey over there.  After having a sandwich at Dakao, that might change.  DC and I stopped here on our way home from a recent trip, and boy was it fantastic.  I had the grilled pork banh mi and DC had chicken.  For starters, the sandwich is about 2-feet long.  It's a lot of food for about $4.  The bread is crunchy and chewy and light.  I could eat the bread alone, but that would be nonsense when I tell you about the rest of the sandwich.  This had your typical banh mi filling of meat, cilantro, jalepenos, and pickled vegetables.  Compared to other places I have been to, the pickled veg was sweet and added a nice balance to the sandwich.  The meat was warm and tender.  My only gripe was that the peppers were sliced into 'chips' and were not present in every bite.  This made some bites searingly hot and others void of all spice.  After finishing my sandwich I immediately wanted to get a second.  I knew that would be a bad idea, but I really had to fight it.  Even now, more than 24-hours later I find myself thinking about that tender grilled pork and tangy-sweet vegetable combo.  One thing to note - you should probably get your order to go.  There is only one small table in the place and it could hardly be considered a 'dining room' of any sort."}
{"text":"i like this place, but not the hordes of pigeons that live on the roof, signage, and ledges of this plaza. i dunno if i want to come here to eat anymore. theres so much pigeon shit its overflowing to the sidewalk in some areas. isnt there a health code violation for this somewhere?"}
{"text":"Boy I was hungry for lunch! I wanted Vietnamese sandwich and someplace new. So, I called Dakao to see if they had a vegetarian sandwich. Check! I asked if they accept credit card! Check! I asked if there is a minimum! $8! Ouch....all I wanted is one vegetarian sandwich. The gentleman said that he will process the transaction with 1 sandwich for $3. So, I jumped in my bat mobile and off to Dakao I go!!  Once I arrived it was all wrapped and ready to go. I did a squeeze test and it felt a little hard. With an open mind, I proceeded back to the office with my Dakao Veggie sandwich.   A las! Back in the office and a bite I go! Indeed and which I was afraid of...bread was hard and crispy, I prefer my bread Fresh as in a hint of crisp on the outside, soft and warm in the inside!   Although I was disappointed with the not so fresh bread and they didn't have any hoisin or siracha sauce, the inside of the sandwich tasted yummy and fresh. Tofu was sauteed with veggie soy sauce, Cilantro, carrots, daikon and cucumber was organically fresh and crispy.   I will give Daikao a chance and next time will request for a fresh bread by expressing my last experience to the gentleman."}
{"text":"Dakao makes the best Banh Mi sandwiches! When coming to Las Vegas we go straight from the plane to Dakao to get our fix on these sandwiches.  We can get them at home, but never as good or fresh. The baguette is second to none!! The ingredients are always made to order and as fresh as can be.  Don't miss Dakao if you want a flavor explosion."}
{"text":"The sandwiches taste much better than Lee Sandwiches.  Don't miss the banh cuon. It's yummy!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I live in the Bay Area but was visiting my sister and she brought us here. Owned and run by a husband and wife team. Ah, reminded me so much of the little Vietnamese sandwich shop my parents owned when we were growing up.  Very low key, informal, family-oriented.  When we came back the next day, the husband was playing chinese chess on a little table outside--just like something my dad would do.  First, I have to say that there is no Vietnamese sandwich in Vegas that lives up to its counterpart in the Bay Area.  My sister told me that straight out.  But Dakao (which my mother said is named after a very lovely neighborhood in Vietnam, which she actually lived in) is the closest thing. If you never had a Bay Area Vietnamese sandwich and died only having had Dakao sandiwches, you'd be well enough off.  (Now, if you died only having had Vietnamese sandwiches from the Lee's down the street, then you'd be an object of pity, but that's another review.)  We went wild during our 2 visits in 2 days here.  We had their basic banh mi (yum) and their grilled pork sandwich (also yum).  They actually had pate so, a savory pastry located in their self-serve counter with a delicious buttery flaky crust filled with ground pork, mushrooms, and some other goodies.  My parents used to sell pate so at their restaurant when I was little but it's now very difficult to find so I was thrilled that Dakao had it--and made EXACTLY the way I had it growing up.  I bought 3, thinking I would bring 1 back to the Bay Area for my boyfriend but while it did make it back, I ended up eating it myself.  They also had this slimy dark green jello-like substance in clear plastic cups behind the counter.  My sister & I had no idea what this was and would have never ordered it but my mother was ecstatic when she saw it. I don't know the name but it's made from a fruit that naturally bears that jello-ey substance.  My mother said that HER mother used to eat it every single day in Vietnam but she (my mother) has never once seen it offered anywhere in all the years she's been living in the US (over 30 years).  We tried it and OMG, it was SOOO refreshing.  A little sugar is sprinkled on top to give it a slightly sweet flavor (make sure you mix it a bit so the sugar gets mixed in).  Very light and perfect for the hot Vegas days.  My sister said she was going to order it often in the future and I'm actually quite jealous that I can't find it anywhere in the Bay Area.  My sister also regularly orders their banh cuon, a paper thin rice noodle pocket with a little ground pork.  I would've ordered that had we not already ordered a billion other things.  It's a tiny place but they have so many freshly made goodies, it's like a candy store to me.  Like I said, I don't live in Vegas but whenever I visit my sister, I'm going to make sure she brings me back here.  The price, the food, the vibe, the owners, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My boss got me addicted to Vietnamese coffee almost a year ago and it's been a routine for me to dropby this place just for that since. Not only is it cheap ($2.50, no tax! Awesome!) but it is on my way to work, so it's very convenient. Also, it opens very early, unlike other places (Lee's Sandwich, another Vietnamese place that sells this kind of coffee, also opens early, but theirs is milky and almost a dollar more, so I'm sticking with my Dakao). I like that it's strong, thus, keeping me awake all day long. The owner (I think) knows me already so when he sees me park, he preps it right away so all I have to do is just pay when I get there. I've tried their sandwich and theirs is just okay, I'd say.   I give them 3 stars for opening early and for giving me my coffee fix for work."}
{"text":"Extremely strong and extremely good iced coffee! I had the House Special and BBQ. Both were very good but my personal tastes favor the BBQ."}
{"text":"When I crave for Vietnamese banh mi in Las Vegas , I usually come here.  Lee's sucks and Hue Thai is ok."}
{"text":"So-so banh mi sandwiches.  I always get the original aka the #1 aka the traditional banh mi sandwich - whatever you want to call it.    Not the best I've ever had and not the worst.   Compared to places in Orange County, this place would probably rate 1 or 2 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty good house special sandwich. I tried the deep fried shrimp bread too. That was OK. Worth a try.  Hue Thai house special tastes better though. It is right up the road."}
{"text":"Got my Vietnamese sandwich fix here. One of the best deals in town. My brother and I are able, to buy 5 and get one free. So basically we each had three sandwiches. You can't beat that deal at all. The sandwich option isn't as big as other place. Either way having over 10-15 option is still good for me. There's like a table or two to sit and eat, but it's primarily a grab and go spot. Great place for the price. I mean about $6 and change per sandwich. What more could you ask for folks lol."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place for Vietnamese sandwiches aka banh mi. Excellent prices. They have banh cuon. Mom and pop shop. Much better than Lees."}
{"text":"The young guy at the counter is really nice and patient. The banh mi here is my favorite in town, nothing can compare to this place! Service is pretty quick, I love it here always hits the spot. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Only Vietnamese deli in town! Food is fresh and tasty. Been coming here for years. Nice to see them finally busy!!!"}
{"text":"Bombtastic Bahn Mi!  My god this crap is good. This has everything I'm looking for in a Vietnamese sandwich. Crunchy fresh baked french baguette, jalapeno, cilantro, pickled diacon radishes, pate', and meat.  When I first tried Dakao's bahn mi I was so impressed that I went back the next day.  Considering the fact that I had to travel about 10 or so miles to acquire this legendary sandwich should give you some sort of insight in to how amazing Dakao's bahn mi is.  I really have nothing else to say.  Fast, affordable and delicious, what else do you need to know.  The only reason I didn't give Dakao 5 stars is because of their lack of seating.  They only have 2 small tables that seat 2 people each. I am not apposed to sitting in my car or even on the curb, however, when it's 100 or so degrees outside it can make it quite uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This has definitely been a Bahn Mi staple in the Vegas valley for many years.... simple yet satisfying! The most amazing part is not only do they do amazing sandwiches on traditional french baguette with multiple styles from original, to veggie, to sardine but they also have Vietnamese breakfast. You can walk in and walk out with something delicious in no time flat!  The pickled veggies are always on point, the cilantro and jalapeño always fresh and the filler is killer! Now if you're walking in expecting this to be a stuffed American style sandwich, don't! It's ment to be light and satisfying however if you need to stuff yourself they have an amazing deal... buy 5 get one free! At an average price of around $3.50 you can feed 5-7 for $20!  Definitely a strip mall delight must go!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered number 7.... Pork and shredded pork skin Banh mi Yummmmmm..... Have to say by far the best Banh Mi I've ever tried outside of Vietnam, baguette is really fresh and chewy, the owner was very friendly too loved this place would go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars if they got my order right.  I wanted the pork loaf with pate sandwich but I got the head cheese with pate sandwich.  Since I didn't want head cheese, I wasn't able to enjoy the sandwich.  I also got the thin rice paper with pork loaf and fish cakes salad.  That was good but I really wanted the right sandwich.  When I'm in Vegas again, I will try this place and make sure they get my order right next time."}
{"text":"With all of the banh mi reviews recently on Yelp (Misti Y. seems to write one every other day) I was craving some sandwiches. Now, I don't know anything about banh mi  and my trip to Dakao was my first time trying one. As others have mentioned, Dakao is tiny. There's only one tiny, metal patio table that seats two in their shop. So plan on eating elsewhere.   I decided to try the grilled chicken and BBQ pork. I didn't like the chicken. The quality of the meat wasn't the best and it lacked flavor. The BBQ pork, on the other hand, was a winner. The flavor was good and the amount of pork that filled the baguette made this $3 sandwich a bargain. With the carrots, daikon, cilantro and cucumbers it was a delicious sandwich with a little bit of a kick from the jalapeños. The outside of the bread was crispy, but the inside wasn't as soft and chewy as I had hoped (old bread perhaps?). Bread is the key to making any good sandwich great, so I can't give this experience any more than 3 stars.  There was a sign that said \"cash only\" but when I asked the girl at the register she said they accept credit cards for purchases over $8."}
{"text":"My nail lady told me about this Banh Mi place. I was craving Vietnamese dessert like when i used to live in Orange County! it a little small place, the gentlemen who served us was very pleasant. they have a nice selection of asian sandwiches like Lee sandwich.  Famous Vietnamese coffee here has well. they have some pickled veggies, pork rolls steamed in banana leaves. i bought 2 che (vietnamese dessert) it was ok. their sandwich was good."}
{"text":"Don't be scared by the curiously unfortunate-sounding name, since I typically don't like to evoke images of German concentration camps when I bite into one of these heavenly Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi).   This place came highly recommended to me by a Vietnamese colleague so when I had two friends from out of town needing a quick bite before hitting the road, I took them to this inconspicuous hole in the wall and we were greeted by a pleasant guy behind the counter who recommended that we get the grilled pork, the meat ball, and the beef banh mi (was intrigued by the sardine and fried egg/chinese sausage offerings).   I appreciated the fact that there were some tasty Asian beverages in the fridge including Thai iced tea, chrysanthemum tea, and sweetened soy milk.  There was also the option of a refreshing glass of vietnamese coffee with sweetened condense milk if you need the caffeinated pick me up.    The first thing you need to know is that they bake their own French baguettes every 45 minutes so you are getting a warm crusty chewy roll that encases your choice of meat with pickled veggies of daikon and carrot, meat pate, and garnished with cilantro and jalapeno.  The owner happily honored our request to cut the sandwiches in thirds so that we could sample all three.    The grilled pork is irresistably crispy with a sweet glazed exterior, the beef is butter-knife tender like a well-cooked filet, and the meatball is broken down like a spread engulfed in a sauce that can only be described as the lovechild of a sweet and sour sauce and a marinara.  All three sandwiches share everything one could hope for in a sandwich: contrasts in texture (chewy bread vs. creamy pate vs. tender meat vs. crunchy veggies), temperatures (warm bread vs. hot meat vs. cold veggies), and flavors (saltiness, tartness, sweetness, and SPICINESS...respect those jalapenos!).  I would give this 5 stars if there was slightly more meat to balance out the bread but I'm sure this could potentially be negotiated upon ordering.    At a price of a mere 3 dollars, a 5 dollar footlong at Subway would actually be considered a scam both in price and quality of product.  My two compadres were so pleased that they both bought an extra sandwich for the road (at 3 dollars, how could one resist?).    Definitely worth checking out if you have a hankering for banh mi or need a change of pace from your typical sandwich offerings in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. The only issue is they run out of food quite often. That's alright in my opinion. You should come earlier if you want everything available. All there bread is fresh made daily so that's a plus in my book. Being a former baker myself the fresh bread is what matters the most. Overall a good joint for quick bites"}
{"text":"This place isn't perfect but it doesn't have to be. I've visited countless times in the past few years and always drop by for my banh mi fix whenever I'm back home in Vegas. Tried almost every sandwich on the menu but the #1 dac biet will always be my #1. Great mix of meats and perfect meat to veg to bread ratio. Bread is hit or miss depending on the time of day- sometimes it's stale but if you're lucky and get it fresh baked man oh man is it heavenly.  Also try their Vietnamese coffee. Some of the tastiest iced coffee I've ever had with the perfect amount of sweetness every time. Yes, it's mostly ice, but who cares. Coffee's so strong it'll smack you awake!  Definitely a cheap eat at around $4 per item, especially when the sandwiches are the length of your forearm. Mix and match for a full meal. Go all out, buy 5 and get 1 free!"}
{"text":"This place is somewhat tucked away in the corner of a primarily-Asian strip mall. Parking is easy enough, but most people are in and out of here with their phone-in orders. Their menu is small, but straight to the point. If you'd like to eat inside, there's a small table with only two chairs. Their sandwiches are huge, but definitely a little bit on the oily side. I like how their bread is crunchy on the outside, but still remains soft on the inside. Meat is tender and vegetables are fresh. They cook everything in the back, behind a wall, but it seems clean enough. I really like their pork sandwich and do prefer this place over Mr. Sandwiches (Dakao seems to be much faster with service since they don't try to do too much with their menu). I'm still trying to compare it to Huong Lan Sandwiches in San Jose (my personal favorite in the bay area), but my boyfriend thinks there really is no true comparison, you like which one you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"I do love beef style bahn mi's. Not many locations carry it which probably means It's not a popular one, but can't help what I like. My favorite place in Cali makes me so picky it's terrible. They used sautéed onions which I'm not sure if I liked or not, but it did taste ok, they should have put some more veggies or more cilantro. I will defiantly comeback.    The two biggest issues are they don't take American Express. Since the baguette is so thin you definitely need two, 1 is not enough for a filling lunch, that's why I wish there was more veggies to help fill you up. But for 4 bucks I guess you can't complain."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese fun food and this is the only place in Vegas that has it.owner is nice food is awesome and the price is right."}
{"text":"I think that they have the best meatball sandwich in town! (Also called Banh Mi Xiu Mai) Sometimes their bread can be a bit hard but besides that, the vegetables and meat for the sandwich taste great and fresh, especially the jalapeños. They also have various Vietnamese snacks and meals that they sell on top the counter too. Service is very quick and nice. The only bad part about this place is that there's only two small tables, so do not expect a seat for you to eat at. This sandwich shop is more ideal for those who want their food quick on the go."}
{"text":"Hyped about Dakao, did not expect to LOVE the Bánh mi as much as I did. Very unassuming spot and set up, and boy do their sandwiches rock. Tried the house special (traditional Bánh mi) and the grilled pork, both with all the veggies and perfectly crunchy bread made the perfect 'wich. The ratio of bread to ingredients is perfected, as are the flavors, and the sandwich itself is actually possible to bite through because of the crunchy and good quality bread. Don't get me wrong, these sandwiches are not getting 5 stars for being novel, culinary masterpieces - it gets 5 stars because they are simple, easy, and exactly what they should be. No silly experimentation or unnecessary changes, fresh and well prepared meat and veggies, and the most reasonable price point possible. If you're craving the flavors of a Bánh mi, and want the best quality, no frills, authentic version outside of Vietnam, look no further. Take away is assumed. If you're eating a sandwich later in the day, ask for the veggies on the side so they stay fresh and crisp throughout the day."}
{"text":"Damn i really wanted to like this place but i literally had no meat mostly bread sucks"}
{"text":"If you like your bánh mì sandwiches with delicate fillings stuffed into a thin, crispy baguette, then Dakao will be right up your alley. My favorites were the vegetarian chay and the special ?ac biet. Their slightly oily and perfectly salty bánh giò is pretty special, too. The green-colored xôi with crushed peanut was better than the red stuff my mom makes at home. There are two tables inside with a few chairs scattered about, though it's better as a carryout deli."}
{"text":"This place is solid, located about 3 miles further down away from the strip compared to the main part of china town. Also, after reading the bad reviews on Lee's sandwiches, I decided to give this place a shot. In the corner of a shopping center, this is definitely a mom and pop. I tried two banh mi, one pork and one beef, both were tasty. It appears they bake their own bread. Also, this banh mi might be the longest one I've ever eaten. You are getting your monies worth. Gf also tried shrimp spring rolls and those were good she said. Only negative is the worker / cashier might be a lil questionable with the calculator / bill. That or he didn't give me any change lol. Good place though."}
{"text":"Okay, Okay. I keep coming back to this place. I just LOVE how crispy and light the bread is! Mr. Sandwich gives you more filling, but the bread tears up the roof of my mouth. AND on this visit, the lady asked in her very limited English if I wanted it to go. I nodded yes, so she only put the grilled pork in the bread. The rest of the fillings were in the plastic bag. When I put the filling in to complete the sandwich, it was THE BEST bahn mi I've ever had (and the filling portions were perfect!). I crave this!"}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches - fast service. Did a catered order here for a huge number of sandwiches. The house special and BBQ pork are both delicious - good amount of meat, savory pate, and crispy baguette. The meat and veggie ratio was good and I was pretty satisfied.   They also do other items - ordered sticky rice (YUMMMY and not too sweet) and vietnamese coffees (which were sipped to the bottom!)"}
{"text":"This is the best store for banh mi!! Came here on a whim cause it was next to this salon I was trying and boy am I glad. The sandwiches are super inexpensive too which is great! The best part of their sandwiches are the sauce imo. It's so savory and creamy. I always get the combo with their extra sauce. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  This is an interesting hole-in-the-wall place near Pho Saigon 8 and BBQ King.  I was kind of apprehensive about walking in, but the staff (this one lady) was nice, and took our order with a smile, if with just a few words.  The sandwiches were made in about 3 minutes (3 sandwiches all together), and we decided to order some of these sesame balls, as well.  We paid for two, and the lady, again very nice, decided to give us 3.  The sandwiches were long, but thin.  About as wide-around as Hue Thai's but 1.5 times as long.  The bread was fresh, with the perfect combination of crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the side, and the filling of each was good and filled the bread up very well.  The vegetables were good, too.    On the whole, the sandwiches were better than Hue Thai (cheaper, more for the money, and about as flavorful), but still not as good as Pho Thanh Huong...  I've still not tried a better banh mi (except maybe the $8 one at Pho at TI, but I might have been drunk, or might have been making it seem better because it cost that much more).  Since it's far out of my normal operating area, I think I'll stick to Pho Thanh Huong, unless I happen to be forced to be in Chinatown.    Extra star for good, friendly, if taciturn, service.  Oh, and the sesame balls were huge!  And quite good, too. If you're in the area, drop in.  Not really worth a special trip, though, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Beyond basic.  The \"dac biet\" sandwich, which means \"special,\" doesn't live up to it's name. The sandwich only comes with a thin slice of head cheese, pork loaf, and ham, contrary to the photo on their menu board, which is shown bursting with meat. The pickled carrots and daikon radish mix is limp and lacks textured crunch because the vegetables are shredded so thin. The \"dac biet\" sandwich comes with pâté, but almost goes unnoticeable because it's spread thin only in the center of the bread, and you don't get a taste of if in most bites. Bánh mì sandwiches tend to come with mayonnaise spread, which the sandwiches here exclude altogether.  Even though Dakao offers a free sandwich for every five that you buy, that's not considered a perk for their skimpy  sandwiches. Maybe they skimped on our six sandwiches because they knew we were from out of town and wouldn't likely come back anyway. Well, Dakao, you're right... I won't come back, not because I don't live in Vegas, but because your sandwiches just aren't up to par."}
{"text":"No line!!! Only 2 tables and chairs inside.  But their Banh mi crusts are thin and crunchy.  Banh Cuon are jelly soft and fresh !  Now I know where to go for fast breakfast when I'm in Vegas!  Plus awesome customer services!"}
{"text":"This bare bones banhmi-eria makes some of the best Viet sammies in the city. Don't mind the dirty parking lot and cruddy sidewalks just mind the light crusty bread and fresh tasty ingredients.   Bring cash."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Slow. Dirty place. To top it off, three dudes were sitting literally 1 foot next to the open front door and smoking their cigs. I just wanted a sandwich and some hot food, but they only served sandwiches on the day I went. If the sandwiches were awesome, I'd live with the setting, but the sandwiches were just ok. Nothing special. Skip this place and either head over to Lees or Mr. Sandwich, both down the street."}
{"text":"This place is simple, and the sandwiches are delicious. The staff  are friendly and they put your order fast. It is a super typical Vietnamese place. Good place for lunch or lights sandwiches."}
{"text":"I wanted a sandwich. Something not Subway. Not greasy. Different. Almost turned into a mainstay, Roma Siena, then saw a tiny sign saying \"Dakao Sandwiches\" and pulled in.  Found a parking spot on the first try.  Looked the place up on Yelp & saw it had 4 stars, so I figured I'd go in. Nothing special, just as others have described - men playing some sort of board game, a long refrigerated counter with unknown foods in it, a guy behind the cash register.  Ordered the #1 (banh mi) and was told that it's a minimum of $8 for my credit/debit card.  Ordered the #9 (veggie) as well.  Next time, I'll bring cash.  As I was leaving, one of the board game guys said in perfect English, \"see you tomorrow\" which I thought was kinda cute.  Got back to my office and sat down to 1/2 of the veggie first.  Filled with chewy mushrooms, this is a savory sandwich.  I like it although I was craving something... different.  Then I bit into 1/2 of the banh mi. It was everything my mouth desired.  A thin crunch on the bread; a mix of meats unlike turkey or roast beef; interesting veggies and a good amount of my favorite, fresh cilantro. Great flavor and satisfied my craving!  Maybe I won't be back tomorrow, but I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has reviewed this place. It's a freakin gem to all people who love Bahn Mi and French Vietnamese Coffee or other types.   I came here because Pho So 1 cashier recommended this place for better bahn mi than Lee's. The cashier at Pho So 1 said that is where they get there sandwich. So I had to check it out.   Came here and was pretty amazed at how inexpensive the Bahn Mi is and also the coffee. And they give you more coffee than Pho So 1 does. WOW. All the bahn mi are $3.00 expect for the steak one which is $3.50. The FVC was just $2.50. I can't tell you how the bahn mi was cause I bought it for my niece. She said she loved it and is going to start buying it from here rather than going to the supermarket a few blocks down. I will come back here cause of the FVC is only $2.50 rather than other places that charge more.   This place is located in a small shopping center. I won't say it is where Saigon 88 is because I've seen several of that. So it's between Lendall (sp?) and Jones.   The lady is friendly and polite. She understood me very well and I'm happy with that.  *FVC= French Vietnamese Coffee"}
{"text":"Every time my husband and I are in Vegas, we visit Chinatown for some Banh Mi. We often go to Mr. Sandwhich but decided to give Dakao a try. OMG their banh mi is soo good! They're bread is perfect. crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. the thickness of the bread is not to doughy either. Their fillings are so good. I tried the veggie banh mi and hubby tried the vietnamese meatloaf.   I think I may have found another favorite banh mi place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm being generous to rate this place 2 stars, and only for the sweet lady at the counter that speaks hardly any English & the grilled pork bahn mi. Except the veggies are sparse & no jalapenos :( flavor was ok but not great by all means. now let me get to the grilled beef...I did not realize that it would be more a western style grilled beef with tons of mushy onions...the taste was just wrong for a bahn mi. I was so hungry and we were already on the 15 heading south so it was all I had to eat since I let my husband eat the better sandwich. Part way eating, it just felt a little gross so I opened the sandwich to actually see the meat, it was almost all fat!  I had to take away a star cause now my tummy hurts so bad & we're stuck in the exiting Vegas holiday weekend traffic. I did like the crunch of the French roll tho. I'm not sure how the rating is so high....very upsetting when I'm steared wrong by fellow yelpers. I don't recommend and will never be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of thinner baguette style banh mi's, but DAKAO in Vegas does these sammies right!  FYI - for my San Jose yelpers, it's not affilated with the Dakao back home!  The bread is crunchy (not to the point where it cuts your mouth like some places) and very soft on the inside. I had the house special (vietnamese cold cuts) and grilled pork sandwich here and both were delicious. The house made mayo sauce here was super flavorful and I liked how the carrots and daikon were thinly shaved.   It's located in the Chinatown district (about 10 minutes off strip) and parking is plentiful! Sandwiches were very friendly on the wallet ($3-$4 each) and were buy 5 get 1 free.   Great service and a definitely a WIN! I wouldn't compare it with some San Jose or OC banh mi's, but for Vegas...5 star banh mi place for sure!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews about this place, I said I have to come here to try out their bánh mì sandwiches.  This place didn't disappoint.  Their baguette was crispy and the meat inside was flavourful.  I ordered their combination and my wife had the cured pork and pork roll.  I liked my selection, but my wife liked her selection more than mine.  For $3.25 each, it was a good bargain.  The baguette was quite long, I would say about 10-11 inches long.  Although not a lot of meat inside, the flavour and crispiness of the baguette made up for the lack of meat.  We also ordered the bánh cun which came with slices of pork roll, bean sprouts and some rice rolls with some sort of filling inside.  Pour their flavoured fish sauce on it and it was delightful.  I am a fan and will definitely be back to try some of their other deli items."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is 2 star, BUT, 2 star means I've had better and I've never had veitnamese before. I got the #9, and as stated, I've never had their food, I dont remember what it was called, other than the veggie sandwich. Someone from school had s sandwich from them yesterday that smelled delicious, so I bookmarked it immediately and decided to come today. I'm disappointed. I heard from a lot of people that vietnamese food offers lots of veggie options and it's delicious. I was NOT impressed at all. I order the veggie sandwich and it's $3.25, sweet! They tell me it's an extra $1 since my order is under $10 (LAME!). I agreed because I really wanted to try it. The lady comes out less than a second later with my sandwich. It looks NOTHING, NOTHING like the picture. I said, where are the greens? She says, Oh you want vegetables....UUUGGGHHHH. I said yes, and she came back with a sandwich that looked more like what was in the picture. So, there's this weird brown stringy stuff that she claims is mushrooms....weird. But my sandwich smells OK, so I decide to stop being a baby and just eat it. It had weird flavors. The cucumber seemed to be soaked in some sort of vinegar concoction I didnt care for. There was too much cilantro for my taste. I just couldn't wrap my head around. I did like the bread. It had a nice crunch although not much more to it. I definitely wont come here again by myself. I'd have to bring a vietnamese person to explain to them what I want. I know it's in Chinatown and all, but someone there should speak english. More than, you want vegetables (Hello! I ordered a veggie sandwich!) Maybe it's the communication, but I wasn't impressed. If you love vietnamese food, I dont think you'd like this place, but it's a 4 star on YELP, so maybe it was just what I ordered."}
{"text":"Very delicious sandwiches, very convenient service, would say the best sandwich place in vegas, drop everything and go try my favorite place in vegas Dakao Sandwiches"}
{"text":"It is located in Chinatown. I've been here plenty of times and tried quite a few of their sandwiches and I usually get 6. Buy 5 sandwiches and get one free. I think it comes out to $20..such a great price!   My fave is the House Special sandwich. They have some specialty items there for sale such as rice noodles dishes, spring rolls with shrimp and pork or sometimes Vietnamese sausage.  The bread/baguette is fresh and the fillings are delicious, with just the right mix of meat, veggies and cilantro.  It's a hole in the wall place and strictly a take out as there is just a few tables if you want to sit, you can.  English is limited but the menu on the wall has pictures and descriptions.  I usually call in my orders and pick up and had no problem the many times I went."}
{"text":"Read some reviews here and said it takes about 15-20 minutes, so I went ahead and called to order ahead of time. I order 2 specials, 2 grilled pork and 2 beef steak (buy 5 get 1 free). The lady told me 15 minutes, I got there in 25 minutes and it was already ready so that's a bonus. The special and pork was really good. Can't beat these for the price ~$4. Friendly service and good food, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I really like this banh mi! This is just a banh mi stand. You go in, get your food, and go. There is a card table set up with a chair, but I'm pretty sure that's for them to rest in between customers.    The older gentleman came out and spoke to me in vietnamese. I couldn't follow, but later I realized he wanted to sell me the last to sesame balls for $1. Damn the missed opportunity!!!! I had already bought three of them (for $2, I believe?) They weren't the best ever, but they were super duper tasty and reminded me of childhood. :)    I always order the Banh Mi Special. When I went, the bread it was on was perfectly crispy, but just this side of chewy, so perhaps not totally fresh, but it was fine for me, I like my bread that way. The ingredients were super fresh and it was tasty.    I worry they may not be very busy right now, and it would be a shame if they closed. I really enjoyed my banh mi. I usually by them by two, but I only bought one since I hadn't tried it before. I've learned my lesson."}
{"text":"The only banh mi I would eat and actually enjoy. I'm from Boston and the banh mi over there is just so much better. This is the only banh mi I would settle for so overall it's a small little place with little snacks and sandwich I like to eat and enjoy. I come for the sandwich the regular house special but before I love the bbq pork. When they do have banh coun or banh tet or even banh beo if I'm super hungry I tend to grab all of those lol."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a little snacky snack before work and got the egg and sweet sausage banh mi which hit the spot for breakfast. Mornings here are a complete madhouse! line in the store, regulars picking up their usual, kinda like a Starbucks in the morning, but instead of coffee and pastries, its coffee and banh mi...  Looking forward to try their version of Iced coffee which looked good and I'm sure alot better than Lee's \"ICE with 3 sips of coffee\" Also on another visit, grabbed baguettes to make some Panzanella(Bread Salad) and a cheese platter...at a buck each, they're cheap, and taste great! ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(138/365) \"Vietnamese Breakfast Sandwich\""}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great, and the prices are okay (got to have the b5g1free deal for it to be worth it), but they skimp on the veggies. I ordered 12 sandwiches (2 were free) to take back to California with me (no foie gras in Cali), and like other reviewers stated, the sandwiches are thinner than typical viet subs. The meats inside were absolutely delicious, but the veggies, which we got separately because that's how we order when we do a bulk order, were lacking in quantity.  We have about 5 sandwiches left in the freezer, and we're out of veggies! I guess we should have planned it out better, but most places give more veggies than Dakao.   The bread is top-notch though. Perhaps next time, I'll split up my order into two 6 sandwich orders and hope to get more veggies. Or, I'll ask them for more veggies.  Unlike a lot of other Asian places that deal in cash money, Dakao charges sales tax, so I opted to pay via credit card... I had the cash handy if they were going to give me a cash price without tax, but no worries!    I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great fresh spring rolls! The sandwiches are really tasty too. It's cheap and yummy."}
{"text":"Got the grilled pork sandwich and the sausage for my friend. We were both deathly sick for days after. Will not go back"}
{"text":"The baguette here is really good. A nice crunch on the outside and the meats are flavorful. They could add more mayo to the banh mi which would really make it better but overall, I'm a fan of the sandwiches here.   Nem is also good here with nice chunks of peppers and garlic."}
{"text":"A very unassuming shop in a tiny strip mall. I definitely felt like I was in Asia somewhere. The bread is large and crispy and so delicately light! It was almost like eating the crispy skin of a Peking duck. I would give it five stars if the banh mi was filled with more meat. As much as I enjoyed the bread, It would be a lot better with more meat and pate!"}
{"text":"Has anyone said Dakao is da bomb yet? It is!  After a perfectly fine breakfast at Lee's the day before, we went to Dakao for their awesome, super fresh breakfast baguette, with eggs and meat but we also specified to include all the normal Vietnamese hoagie fixins.   Picked up some sides with it, including sesame balls and a kind of banana dessert that we weren't sure about but also turned out to be totally delicious. Add to that the electric jolt known as iced cafe sua and we were off to the races.   This is the kind of shop I'd come to all the time if it were close by because you can just assume everything is good and whatever treats they make that day will be worth trying."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after reading Stephanie B's review of this place and I just had to come and try it myself!  I went a little overboard, I got two sandwiches, the grilled chicken and the pork roll, the banh cuon, and the tofu chinese sausage summer rolls.  Well after that first bite of the banh cuon, I am a fan!    Let start with the sandwich, the bread is exactly what french bread should be!  Crunchy and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside!  Each bite is a crisp bite filled with the sweet and sourness of the pickled daikon and carrots.  NOM NOM!  As for the chicken, it's not the usual chicken I'm use to in my Banh mi (chicken thigh), instead they use chicken breast, which is not my cup of tea, but to others this may.  The pork roll was pretty delicious!  They put a spread of pate on the bread topped with thinly sliced pork rolls.    The bahn cuon is just how I remember it to be when I had it in Hawaii!  It was so good!  Very peppery and tasteful!  Soft skin with a kick from the filling.  Top it with some fish sauce and sirrhacha, it is oh so delicious!   Summer roll you say?  What is that?  Well to the people on the mainland, a summer roll is what you guys refer to as a spring roll.  It is the fresh roll that is non fried and stuffed with rice noodles, lettuce, thai basil, pork and shrimp!  Well instead of the original one I always get, I went for the unique one that was filled with tofu, carrots, daikon, dried shrimp, and Chinese sausage and boy was that good!  Great decision made!    I cannot wait to go back to this place and try more things!  Oh and their ice coffee is also really good!  Only $2 for a medium sized coffee!!  I think it's cheaper than the one at Lee's!  Taste just the same!  If not stronger! ;-)"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches! They were pretty generous with the pate spread, which is my favorite part of banh mi. Very similar to those I ate in Westminster. Will come back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"So since I'm from San Ho, this is an unfair competition....I used to live near Story and King, we are talking center of Little Saigon...All Vietnamese on one side Mexicans on the other, but what a haven for foodies!  We are talking 2 for 1 samiches at $2.50!!!!!! and the Pho? the BEST broth ever, especially at Pho Ha.  So I tried the thit nuong, a bit dry and crispy, bread is decent, veggies ok but a bit on the skimpy side.  also had the xiu mai (my favorite) not badd but a bit soggy.....overall edible but not fantastic....stay tuned for the next episode.....til next time, good eating!"}
{"text":"I love a good, cheap banh mi and Dakao provides both. Most of the sandwiches are priced around $3-4, which is already cheaper than the Lee's Sandwiches up the street. The baguette is fresh and soft and won't cut up the roofs of your mouths, which I hate. I've tried the #1 combo, the #6 bbq pork, and the #12 steak. Of the three, the pork is my favorite. I wish they had more pâté on the combo, which was less flavorful than what I would have liked. They also have a buy 5, get one sandwich free deal, if you're looking to stock up for the week."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and had a craving for banh mi...  Thank you to fellow Yelpers, they pointed us to the right place.  $3 for all types of banh mi (except for the Beef @ $3.50) was a super great deal!  We bought 5 banh mi and got one for free!  We ordered thit nuong (grilled pork), ga nuong (grilleed chicken), nem nuong (grilled pork meatballs) and bo nuong (grilled beef) and they were all delicious!  Our favorite is the bo nuong.    Their bread had a great proportion of the soft and slightly sweet taste inside and a nice crispy crunch on the bread skin.  Not too thick.    We devoured 3 banh mi in a matter of minutes!  Can't wait to come back and  get some more and try out their coffee next!  Try it out!  It will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"You can't call yourself a banh mi master until you have paid tribute to this temple of divine eats. Okay, so it really looks like a hole in the wall joint but that's where you gotta go sometimes to find the magically and spiritually liberating kind of stuff. Which other banh mi place can boast they make their own bread? THEIR OWN BREAD??? A good banh mi is only as good as the bread that it is incased it. Not many and don't give me lip about general lee's fakewich down the street either. If you want the real deal, you got to dig deep. Sandwiches range from 3.25 - 3.75. This place won't break the bank and the sandwiches are a foot long. EAT THAT JARED. No, literally. Eat it, it's good for you. Another amazing thing about them is that you buy 11, they give you the 12th free! SCORE. with 12 different kinds of banh mi and even a vegetarian to boot, who wouldn't want to give this place a shot? If it seems I am over zealous about this place, I promise you I couldn't be zealous enough. If you love banh mi then definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Most Authentic Banh Mi I have found in vegas so far. So sooo yummy and inexpensive. I wish they had a bbq pork option but still so good either way. I've been here twice now and plan on being a regular visitor for a quick bite"}
{"text":"2 stars because the owner was nice & friendly. I went in about 2pm, place was empty so my food did come out rather quick. The bread tasted good, nice crunch to it but very thin, and on the small side. I ordered the BBQ pork & grilled chicken with extra meat (I always do extra) and if I hadn't it would seem to little of meat. The flavor of the meats were good but we were disappointed in the veggies. While the cilantro was fresh everything else was soggy and not fresh or crunchy at all. The biggest ding is there are no tables. You can't come in with friends for lunch this is a to-go only place. As for other foods in there, I must've showed up after the lunch rush bcuz there wasn't much in the cases or on the counter. With all of the positive reviews I expected much better. There's so many other bahn mi shops in china town that I'd rather go to. But obviously a lot of people prefer this place maybe I'm just not authentic enough lol"}
{"text":"My craving for bahn mi took me here, especially since it shares the name with one of my favorite bahn Mi shops in San Jose. Not sure if they are affiliated or not .    Sandwich was well priced and turnaround from ordering to receiving food was super quick.  Bread was fresh but very crispy and a lot smaller / thinner than what I've had with other bahn mi, and chicken was shredded and in a pretty small portion size.  Overall the sandwich was good but pretty basic and not very filling. Would probably need two to feel substantial enough for a meal vs a snack."}
{"text":"A legit Vietnamese deli in Vegas. I've come here before after 5pm on weekdays disappointed by the barren display. But, I realized during my recent visit that this place shines early in the day - before everyone else takes all the food. At 11:30 am, they still had a few precious boxes of banh cuon available at $6 - I've only found one other place in this city that even makes this, so I quickly snatched one. Two petite ladies behind me immediately grabbed the four remaining boxes and depleted their entire banh cuon inventory for the day. Savage. I also ordered my usual #1 house special sandwich and a #12 beef steak for the hubs. A delish meal for 2 for under $15. #lifehack"}
{"text":"Honestly, I've had better priced and better tasting bahn mi in the Cali area but for me, Dakao has some of the much better bahn mi in good ol' LV!  I had a hankering for some Viet food one day and we somehow ended up seeing this place from the corner of our (Asian) eyes.  Tucked into a corner right next to a hair salon, there was a small line at the counter.  I look to my left, a drink cooler, I look to my right, a food cooler, I look up...a menu of Vietnamese sandwiches!  I figure why not give it a shot.    Dakao is a very small place that is meant for take-out or pick-up so don't plan on eating here.  They do have one tiny table with two plastic chairs, but I think those are more for decoration than anything.  So order, wait, take your bahn mi outside or eat at home.  Or do like me and take your bahn mi to the 168 Market right down the street and eat it at the food court there while people are watching you with awe while constantly getting asked, \"Where you get that?  Where you get that?\"  Where indeed.  There are 12 bahn mi sandwiches on the menu at Dakao.  They each range from $3-4.  Yes, expensive for bahn mi standards for Cali folks...but not bad for us desert dwellers here in LV.  Don't forget, you buy 5 bahn mi, you get 1 free!  I for some reason have never bought only one or two when I go to Dakao.  I always get the 5 with the 1 free because usually there will be someone in my family that will say, \"Hey...where's mine?\"  It never fails.  Who knew you had to feed kids constantly?  I haven't tried all 12 bahn mi yet at Dakao but give me some time, I'll get there.  I stick with the #1 (House Special), #3 (Marinated Pork Ball), #6 (Grilled Pork), #7 (Shredded Pork & Skin), #8 (Grilled Chicken), and #11 (Meatball).  The #1 seems to be the fav of the family.  If you see 'House Special' on a bahn mi menu, expect to see head cheese, pate, and pork loaf on your sandwich.  Andrew Zimmern haters be warned!  There be some Bizarre Foods in the #1 bahn mi at Dakao.  But damn...it's good!  The bread at Dakao is what does it for me.  It's a skinnier bahn mi, but the bread is not too hard on the outside, and not too chewy on the inside.  It's just right.  Pretty good French roll.  I just wish they added more fillings to their sandwiches!  They can be a bit on the paltry side with the meat and the veggies.  I love those pickled veggies!  I always have to ask for extra veggies on the side for my bahn mi, thankfully they've never charged me extra for it.  I also like some hoisin sauce on my bahn mi, luckily we often times take our sandwiches home.    There's also a lot of Vietnamese deli items including various pastries, buns, rolls, and desserts but I always forget about them since all I do is focus on that BIG @$$ bahn mi menu every time I walk in there.  My order is easy, all I do is go, \"3 #1, 1 #6, 1 #7, 1 #8, to go, extra veggies on the side please\" and I'm done.  So easy, even an old Asian lady can do it!  Dakao takes credit/debit cards but they prefer cash instead.  Service, even if minimal, is always quick and friendly for me.  Hit up Dakao Sandwiches if you want a big bahn mi for a mini-mi price!"}
{"text":"Vegas tends to bring out the DRUNKEN GARBAGE DISPOSAL in me, among other things...  Anyone who has stayed in a hotel room with me at Vegas will often find crushed chips on my bed, nacho cheese sauce smeared on the side of the sheets, not to mention overturned take-out boxes scattered around all over the room.   After a Room Service FAIL back in July 2010 at the Palazzo, my friend and I decided we would no longer order room service, no matter how drunk and starving we were.  In December 2010, after getting Chinese foot massages, we decided to pick up some banh mi for some drunken eats later that night. I realize this review is over 2 months late, but I'm at home sick (my punishment for the sins I committed last week at Vegas) so I've decided to catch up on some of my Yelp reviews. As far as details go, I normally take notes on my BB so information integrity is not compromised by my alcohol-induced memory loss.   DAKAO SANDWICHES is located in an Asian Shopping Plaza on Spring Mountain Road in Chinatown (8 min cab ride from the Strip). They offer 10 banh mi varities for $3 each. They also have various Banh Bao (steamed chicken and pork buns), Banh Cuon (steamed rolled noodles), Xio (sticky rice) and Cha Lua (steamed pork sausage) and Mon Trang Mieng (desserts) and a variety of juices and sodas.  I ordered the Combo Banh Mi which was served in a flat French baguette.   CC's accepted with a $8 minimum.  THE MORNING AFTER...  I woke up to breadcrumbs on the pillowcase and trailed along the floor which was no surprise, but as I walked to the front drawer, laid the real SHOCKER... I found chunks of the baguette scattered all over the floor and underneath the drawer. Apparently, when I stumbled back into the hotel at 5 AM (according to my friend), I had broken off pieces of the baguette because the banh mi fixings were scant and the bread was dry.   My more sober friend had the same assessment, she said the banh mi was really bready and dry, there was just 3 slices of meat (ham, headcheese, and bologna) , there was very little mayo and the scant amounts of pickled daikon and carrots just got lost in the bread.  So even operating under auto pilot I STILL knew this was a Banh Mi FAIL!"}
{"text":"My mom told me about this place as I was looking for some Vietnamese sandwiches. These are the skinny version but they taste better than majority of the places in town. If you buy 5 sandwiches, you get 1 free. You have the option to leave the veggies in the sandwich or placed outside so it's in a baggy and you can add it in yourself. Their banh cuon dakao is very tasty as well."}
{"text":"In my ongoing struggle to find truly good Vietnamese food in Las Vegas, I finally made it out to the supposed best sandwich shop around. I ordered the Banh Mi Dac Biet (house special) and the Banh Mi Thit Nuong (grilled pork). Both were $3.25.  I ate the Thit Nuong on the night of purchase, and I saved the Dac Biet for later. The latter held up nicely after a quick toast in the oven, which is a pretty standard result.  I won't really go into too much detail on the sandwiches. The components taste nice and seem fresh, but I don't think there's enough meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, or even jalapeno. In other words, it's kinda like Subway but with fewer veggies. The overall result, unfortunately, is that the sandwiches are not very filling, and they leave you with bread as the main after-flavor.  Maybe I'll check out some of the pate chaud or banh bao on the counters if I'm ever in the area again. Otherwise, I'm going to wait for something good from California (and no, Lee's Sandwiches does not count)."}
{"text":"I come here every time we visit Vegas. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's the closest I can get to the ones my mom makes at home. Living in Phoenix, there are very few Vietnamese sandwich places to choose from and they're all terrible. Sketchy area. Try to avoid using the restroom here."}
{"text":"I think the fact that they are cheaper than hue thai makes it taste better, the bread is baked every hour which you can taste, but the grilled pork was marinated badly and was thickly cut and oversalty.  Because the meat is essential to the sandwich it is unfortunate that I had to give three stars instead of four stars.  I plan on going back and trying their other sandwiches like the veggie, egg, and the number one cause I heard their pate is good.  We'll see..."}
{"text":"Yummy variety of Vietnamese sandwiches with other specialty items such as rolled rice cakes with pork (banh cuon thit) and sticky rice. They even have banh mi with Chinese sausage & egg. Friendly service and they open early for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"First time checking this place out. Definitely will be back. Friendly service with wide variety of food options. I ordered the sardine sandwich and the bf got the pork roll. Idk about you guys but I love sardines and they did not go light. I got a sandwich filled with sardines fresh and pickled veggies. I absolutely recommend. The bread was light and flaky too. Pork roll was also good, he doesn't eat veggies so he ordered double meat, it was a generous amount. They have takehome pork rolls and other delights including some sweets. I recommend the sesame ball filled with mung bean chewy outside with a not too sweet center. Loved it."}
{"text":"I had heard that this palace is the best in Vegas, so I tried it out. There's a place in the valley of l.a. that has really amazing combo banh mi, so I tried the combo sandwich and the BBQ pork from here, along with cafe su da.   Get the BBQ PORK!!!!! It was waaaaaaaay better than Lee's. Really good marinade and pork was delicious. The combo was meh.   I'd hands down choose this place over lee's for my banh mi, but I may hit up lee's for their coffee since they give more and it seems stronger."}
{"text":"Who said that woman cannot live by bread alone!  They have never been to Dakao!  Delicious crispy crust on the outside and oh so tender on the inside!  I ordered the House Special which was amazing.  I love cilantro and jalapeno (ingredients in my favorite margarita)!  My friend ordered the grilled pork.   At 3 bucks, I thought that the sandwiches were going to be tiny.  WRONG!  Perfect size for lunch (with an iced coffee).  Aware of the lack of seating, we took our sandwiches to a nearby park.  We split our sandwiches since I started to eat the wrong one (I was hungry).  Luckily, we were both very happy with each other's choice.  :-) Next visit, I am bringing a group of co-workers so we can sample the menu!"}
{"text":"Actually came in for the seseme ball desserts but they were out. Ordered 3 different sandwiches but 2 of the 3 were wrong and the bread was hard..they don't have prices on the desserts and the \"nam\" (fermented pork and pig skin) so watch for pricing. Was charged 5.50 each for such a small portion."}
{"text":"Great little find from other Yelpers. The owner was very patient as I couldn't decide. It was a good break for my wallet from the Strip Food joints. The grilled pork was really good. So good that we started out with 3 sandwiches and ended up with 6. He let us just buy two more and gave us one free. Great for our plane ride home later. The Cafe Sua Da was really good too. Just the right balance someone and the expresso was not bitter and. It too sweet on the sweetener side. Well worth the find."}
{"text":"Quick/efficient service and banh mi making and also tasty cheap banh mi!   For $3.40 I got the #5 cured pork and rolled pork banh mi. I like that the baguette is longer and narrower, which makes eating a lot easier and less messy. The cured pork was delicious and they did not over do it with with cilantro and jalapeno slices. Apparently their Viet coffee is also very strong as most of the people in my party could only drink 1/3-1/2 of their cups. Highly recommend coming here to pick up a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Just ok.  Not very much meat in #8 grill chicken sandwich.  Ordered 2 iced coffes, but they could only make 1.  I still choose Hue Tai for vietnamese sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ordered the banh cuon here. It was pre made and it was only $6. It was good. They have other stuff here but I was just craving banh cuon."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered 4 sandwiches; 3 special and 1 thit nuong.  I was not impress, the bread was not crispy and fluffy.  It was rather stale and chewy. The expression from my wife and kids said it all when they bit into their sandwiches. Bored and a little disappointed just like the sandwiches.    I also ordered the Nam; which was $6 buck for 10 cubes.  To me that was well worth it.    Still getting a one star since we were very excited before we got there for the sandwiches and left very disappointed.  BTW one table with only 3 chairs.  If you're planning to stay go elsewhere. Better yet I would go elsewhere going forward."}
{"text":"Same good food, slight facility upgrade, more to go offerings. I'm glad this place listens to me. It only took 3 years but my god, it's 3years too long since I've been here. In another 3 years we should be able to get a Michelin Star!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches our family ordered were good, we stopped by here to grab togo food on the way home and was pleasant happy with out on the road snacks..."}
{"text":"Since vietnamese sandwiches are something I have on a weekly basis at home, I was really craving one during my frequent trips to Las Vegas (I have family here). After looking on yelp for a vietnamese sandwich location in vegas and not finding any listings, my hopes were down.  But then my boyfriend had mentioned that he saw a Dakao location that he had passed.  So, we ventured on to Dakao Sandwiches here in Vegas. When we got there, the inside of the sandwich shop was very plain and didn't have any furniture or anything yet. But this was understandable since they had just opened up and are new.  However, they had a simple menu consisting of 8 different types of Banh Mi (vietnamese sandwiches).  I had the roasted chicken sandwich (my favorite and usual), which was very good. The chicken and ingredients in the sandwich were very fresh and tasty. Also, the sandwich was warm when I got it, so I knew that they had made the entire thing to order.    + pros: very good vietnamese sandwich  + cons: very small location. no space to sit down. pretty much a takeout only. very limited menu. but im sure they will expand once they get going.  great addition for vegas, since there are not many other places that have the Banh Mi sandwiches. hopefully there will be demand!"}
{"text":"Horribly disappointed in the Banh Mi Ba Le special.  I used to come here a lot until they went cheap on the sandwich. The meat were sliced so thin you can see through them.  I get pissed off everytime I open my sandwich and all I see is veg and jalapenos. Dakao, I quit you."}
{"text":"The banh mi here isn't even that good. Overrated for sure. The staffs are rude, gave us an attitude for ordering more food. They say buy 5 get 1 free, but the free ones barely had anything in it. We should've just went to Lee's Sandwich. The staffs there are friendly and professional. That's where we went to get drinks after ordering here. We felt unwelcome and rushed."}
{"text":"Dakao is incredibly inexpensive, they have amazingly quick service, and their food is delicious! I spent no more than $5 coming here and was able to get a grilled pork sandwich and a coke. I've been going to the Mr. Sandwich just down the street from here for years when I used to live in Las Vegas, but found out from a friend that they closed. I love getting Vietnamese sandwiches since they're usually quick, easy, and delicious. I was really sad to hear that my usual spot closed down, but I'm super glad I found this place.   Dakao is a great addition to the Spring Mountain neighborhood and you can tell that many of their customers seem like they're regulars. Everyone who walks in here seems to know what they already want and I don't doubt that they consistently deliver great product. The grilled pork sandwich I tried her was amazing and I definitely regret not ordering at least two of them! I can't wait until I'm in town again to try their other sandwiches on their menu."}
{"text":"The banh mi here is good, not great like places in OC. The bread and vegetables are fresh. They load too much meat in the sandwiches, which maybe some people will like, but it really should be a balance to be a great sandwich."}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich to escape the crowd on the strip. For the most part this establishments offers a decent sandwich, however, it does has it flaws.  Cons: - The bread was too flaky and had very little chew - The ingredients were okay, but nothing stood out - Service was a bit slow  Pros: - Friendly service - Decent amount of ingredients in the sandwich  We tried both the cold cut special (dac biet) and the bbq pork (thit nuong)."}

{"text":"Let me just tell u ... this place is great.. super yummy and super cheap sanwitches r huge and only 4 bucks tasty good and cheap give it a try ! Its places like thus that make me happy i jumped out of my comfort level..."}
{"text":"BS +++  BANH MI SOMETHING NICE!!!! I never had Viet-sammiches and let me tell you.  I much rather have this than an IN-N-OUT and that says a lot.   The sandwiches in this spot are small but for $3.40 ARE YOU SERIOUS? They are long and skinny but the meat ratio is superb.  The veggies are fresh and delectable.  This place as an adorable cashier who's speaks English pretty well so you can ask as many questions as you would like.  I ordered the chicken and the beef.  Both were fresh and soft.  I am going to make sure to order the 5 +1 free special before I go home to NYC.  The wait time is none.  The place is very small.  It only has two tables.  Who cares! Take it to your car.  Go walk it like it's your new fave pet.  Go find a nice bench.  Take a long walk in the park and watch the sunset with it.  Just enjoy it because let me tell you for $3.40 this is the closest you'll get to heaven Banh Mi on Earth.    Location is CLEAN, PROFESSIONAL. ORGANIZED Staff Awesome, friendly, spoke kindly, and was patient. Parking lot is SHARED and SMALL Restrooms Did not see one Seating Very few.  Take it home!  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"So it's been a while since my last review but here it goes. I heard a lot of rant about this place and finally during errands I got a chance to stop by. I ordered the #1 Dac Biet House Special. That banh mi packed some serious punch. The meat was soo flavorful. The bread is really yummy and crunchy, skinnier baguettes than normal but longer. The veggies were fresh and those fresh jalapeño slices had a nice kick.   The place looks kinda dingy but please overlook that, the banh mi's are exceptional. There's not really a place to sit so I took mine home. I came late towards the afternoon and they had a limited selection of their other offerings so I was happy to leave with my banh mi and a drink. They have a cooler with a wide selection of drinks. I went for the Tamarind juice which was super good, sweet and sour.   I have to go and eat another banh mi from Mr. Sandwich later this week so I can make up my mind on that last 5-star. These banh mi's were so flavorful though I'm caught in a dilemma."}
{"text":"This is best place for Vietnamese \"banh mi and ca phe sua da.\" The french sytle bread is soft and crunchy.  The line is short and the owner is friendly. If you are in Las Vegas, and you want a Vietnamese sytle sandwich. This is definitely your first choice. My wife and kids love this place."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with these authentic bahn mi, wife had the veggie - oh to die for, I had the grilled pork then the beef both perfect, I would have liked more jalapeño and should have asked, saw other Vietnamese people order after me - where the locals go for a quick, cheap bahn mi"}
{"text":"I'm a fanh!  I ordered the house special banh mi for $3 and I was very satisfied!  I love the price, the immediacy and, of course, the flavor.   I didn't catch their hours, but this place would be great to go to on the way home from a night on the strip.   I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to try the house special banh mi. The bread always looks hard, but it's a little crispy and soft on the inside.  Would come and try other options like the egg and sausage one next time."}
{"text":"There is no better $3 sandwich in Las Vegas. The bank mi is just about the best that I've had. They are thin sandwiches made on a fresh, crunchy baguette with just the right amount of sweet pickled veges and thinly sliced jalapeño. We love the egg and chinese sausage best, but also the steak and chicken are first rate. Call and order ahead if you are in a hurry.  Also, the sweet dessert cups on the counter are wonderful as is the sticky rice flour cake (not too sweet with a hint of coconut).  Cash only."}
{"text":"What a shame.... This place has really good sandwich but talk about service. I'd give their sandwich a 5 star but their service a -1 so a 2 star is pretty generous. Front lady who's probably the owner, on the phone 80% of the time while I was waiting for 6 sandwich. Seriously? Half an hour for 6 sandwich? The 6th free one is NOT worth my time waiting. Been here before and know the service is slow but this is by far the worse!!! Last time and never again!!!!"}
{"text":"This place did a good job with their vegan sandwich option. I don't think I've seen a vegan option for bahn mi sandwiches in Hawaii so I'm impressed with Dakao Sandwiches for offering that! The sandwich is packed full of flavor from the seasoned mushrooms and tofu followed with the herbs jalapeño and pickled veggies ! The sandwich is crunchy and soft as well. Very good place would come back"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to grab a Banh Mi sandwich, without a doubt.  The bread is where it starts. It's made fresh into perfection, balancing your sandwich out with the right amount of crunch and softness. Then from whichever of the ten different types of sandwich you choose, you won't be disappointed. The menu option is pretty universal but this place stays true to its tradition by offering the most popular flavors.   They also have assorted Vietnamese delicacies Saran wrapped like any other hole-in-the-wall joint to go along with your sandwich just incase you weren't filled up. Stock on on those too while you're at it. The place might look like nothing spectacular from the outside but you're mind will change immensely once you take a bite of their Banh Mi, hands down."}
{"text":"I actually like this place and think that the sandwiches are pretty good. My girlfriends whom I came here with disagree. We all ordered number one, the house special with pate, ham and pork roll. They thought the bread was too hard and the sandwich was too dry.  They also didn't find it all that flavorful.   I however thought it was good.... Maybe my standards are lower?  But I do know my Vietnamese food well.  It could have used a bit more mayo but I thought the vegetables and pate were on point. The bread was a little dry for me but I think it's cause we went at the end of the day. They could have also put a little more meat in the sandwiches but the sandwich itself was pretty big. I finished one for dinner and was full the whole night. The place is really small with no seats so it's more of the pickup and to go spot.   Other than sandwiches they also sell some coconut desserts. Didn't get to try it but they looked good. They also have a buy five get one free deal."}
{"text":"Dishonest cashier, did not return change!  Food not so great. Not worth the money. Old men hang out playing Chinese chess sort of place"}
{"text":"Lunch time and we were craving a sandwich! I remembered reading about Dakao so we gave it a whirl. It's in the corner of an unassuming tiny strip mall. You hardly notice it driving by. I tried the vegetarian option, my boyfriend, the beef  - it was quite interesting.  For those of you that are offended by strong flavors then its not for you.   We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch, left satisfied and it didn't break the bank. It is a no frills, simply put, Vietnamese take on hoagies. Nicely toasted french bread with a nice selection of fillings.  Must have the coconut jello too, the look does not do it justice!  It was yummy!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good banh mi shop on Spring Mtn...go here! Don't stop at Lee's, keep driving lol. It's my first time here, but I'm impressed with the cheerful, fast service and good prices. I got the #6 grilled pork banh mi. I opened my sandwich to check out the goods and it's a skinnier sandwich than what I'm used to, but the meat ratio was good. I wish it had more veggies! The bread was fresh, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Next time, I'll try the other sandwiches. They do offer other small appetizer/snack like items. There is limited seating. Your best bet is to take your food to go. They offer a special buy 5, get one free for the beef sandwiches!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside... Actually, it doesn't look like much from the inside either. But this poorly decorated, seemingly run-down little shop is home to my 'Holy Grail' banh-mi.  There's no seating; unless you count the rickety plastic patio furniture out front. There's a single table and 2 chairs. Don't expect to claim it yourself. Its usually taken by patrons of the nail salon next door or little old Vietnamese grandpas.   The meat tastes better here. The veggies fresher. And the bread softer and more delicious than any other banh mi bread I've ever had. As much as I'd prefer to stop at Dakao, I find it an epic struggle to make it during business hours. They close at 8pm during the week and 6pm on the weekends. I generally don't work at 9-5 schedule so I consider those hours a little limited for me. Regardless, when I come I'll order a variety of edibles  and can't forget a refreshing Vietnamese Iced Coffee. If available, I'll stock up on the rolled noodles with pork, sesame balls, and any other good-looking sides they have available.  There's also deli case filled with things I cannot actually identify. In my years of patronage, I've never asked nor purchased anything from said case. There are meat looking items and jellied things in there that I've found a little intimidating and downright unappetizing. I suspect the contents to be more popular with the authentic Vietnamese customer.  And like many Asian owned establishments on Spring Mt -- cash Only."}
{"text":"My mom lives in San Jose, CA where there are dozens banh mi places clustered together, battling it out for banh mi supremacy. Well, actually, they are just battling it out for survival since the competition is so fierce.  We only had two banh mi's here (the grilled pork and house special), but the two sandwiches right up there with the ones from San Jose. The baguette could have been a bit crunchier on the outside, but other than that, these were delicious. The meats were grilled just right, the vegetables were pickled just right, and the friendly man at the counter offered to put any of the condiments on the side (jalapeno, cilantro, etc.).   I think they did something with the mayo sauce that gave the sandwiches a little extra flavor boost, but I couldn't be sure. Anyway, if you have a craving for banh mi and don't feel like flying down to San Jose, drop by."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star...due to price and taste!  This place is a true hole in the wall...inside the corner of a mini mall on Spring Mtn, in the same parking lot as Pho Saigon 8 and BBQ King!  Starting off with price and value, this place is awesome. The sandwiches are about $3, and they are filled with plenty of goodies and yummy meats. The sandwiches are fairly large, and one banh mi should fill a normal person up, maybe with a drink and something else on the side. I made the mistake of ordering two since they are inexpensive, and almost ate both because they were so good!  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dakao-sandwiches-las-vegas?select=31yJvfSRysdpLR-XyYTwfw#31yJvfSRysdpLR-XyYTwfw  I heard the bread here is made fresh every 45min....It was very good,with a slightly crispy/crunchy outside but soft and tasty on the inside.  I tried the #6 Banh Mi Thit Nuong (Grilled Pork) and #12 Banh Mi Bo Nuong (Beef Steak) with a Thai Tea in the bottle! I think I preferred the taste of the beef here vs the pork, but the Pork sandwich had all the good veggies and a bit more flavor overall in the sandwich! The thai tea was good and cheap at a little over a dollar a bottle!  Closeup on Beef : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dakao-sandwiches-las-vegas?select=Y6Uvy-r9B-uNLl6zJYt3Mg#Y6Uvy-r9B-uNLl6zJYt3Mg  Closeup on Pork : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dakao-sandwiches-las-vegas?select=CnVprCR56D32cy2w5DN72g#CnVprCR56D32cy2w5DN72g  Only a tiny table with three chairs to eat...so this place is a to-go kinda shop.  I can definitely see myself ordering a bunch of sandwiches here for a party!  I think this whole meal including the drink ran me around $7-8, so definitely check it out for some cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Anyone that tells you that Lees sandwich is the best bahn mi GTFOH!! this is where vietnamese people and real bahn mi eaters go to get their bahn mi. their bread is unlike anyone and their flavors are awesome. i've tried the bbq pork i believe #6  the #1 and #2 those are my favorites.  Also they offer stuff in this place like a big variety of asian drinks and stuff like bahn guan,bahn bao, siopao, which are also really good. another thing i see when people eat here is they always seem to order their  iced vietnamese coffee. I've had it but its super strong for me but if you like strong coffee this is what you want.  Overall when i'm in the mood for bahn mi this is thee go to place.. everyone else is WHACK!"}
{"text":"$3.00 Vietnamese sandwiches that are smaller than your usual but the bread is crunchy and the fillings are fresh.  I like the shredded pork, the combo, and most choices except for the grilled/charbroiled pork as the meat was dry on that one.  If you buy 5, you get one free!    What is kind of funny is that I grabbed a $.99 Arizona tea can and they charged me $1.50.  I asked about that and she just shrugged.  Oh well.  By the way, be sure to eat it within a short time of buying to enjoy the crunch of the bread or else you must toast it for optimal flavor."}
{"text":"I was craving some vietnamese sandwiches and found this place on yelp. Saw 4 stars and thought it must be a really good place to try. I tried their house combination and grilled chicken. They use baguette bread instead of the other kind of bread I was used to. To be honest, my review is solely based on my experiences from my home town. The baguette bread was too crispy and they were pretty skimpy on their filling. The flavor wasn't too great on the house special. I love the house special (#12 and huong lan in sac). I was hoping to get that same taste. But the meat and pate just didnt taste right. The grilled chicken was pretty tasty though. I just wish there was more of the pickled carrots and softer bread."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of Vietnamese sandwiches because of the ingredients, so it has to be a good sandwich for me to give it 5 stars.  Came here for lunch on a Saturday. I ordered the pork sandwich - I always order that grilled pork whenever I go to a Viet restaurant. The sandwich was about 10 inches (?) and packed with flavor. This is not a saucy sandwich so you don't have worry about a mess.   Delicious sandwich, cheap and filling!  Dakao is my go-to restaurant for a \"dry\" sandwich. (My moist sandwich go-to place is Capriotti's..check out my review for that place!)"}
{"text":"Here's the skinny... these are skinny banh mi. But as long as the skinny is filled with tasty morsels, I'm all in!  I consider Dakao my favorite banh mi go to, but it isn't without its blemishes. I always get the vegetarian tofu option, but I should qualify this by letting you know that 2 times out of 5 they are out of this option! Not cool. When they do have it, it is the real deal because they have a special, flavorful tofu filling. I am not exactly sure what's in there, but it tastes like super savory onions and soy sauce and... good things.   The store is super small, and we never want to sit down and eat the sandwich there. It just feels a little odd, so we end up eating in our car, and then our car smells like the wonderful, but odorous veggie filling. I am not really a fan of my car smelling like food. (We're the type of people that put doggie bags in the trunk.)  Plus, we've never been successful in using our credit card, but based on the other reviews, it can be done. Either way, I hate having to beg to use plastic.  Still, despite the blemishes, the vegetarian filling here is the star for mi."}
{"text":"Got a banh bao and it was cold and dry. They could have at least heated it back up. Towards my last couple bites, I bit into something hard. Which is fairly unusual for banh bao. It looked like a piece had broken off of someone's tooth."}
{"text":"I recently stopped by the Bahn Mi (Vietnamese poboy) shop by my work for lunch again and decided it was time to pen a review on this place.  When I walked in, all the other customers were speaking Vietnamese, which is par for the course at this place. I ordered two poboys so that I can take one home for supper: the #1 House Special and the #6 Marinated Pork. I rarely mention exact prices in a review, but the House Special, pictured on top, was $3.40 and the Marinated Pork was ten cents more. The most expensive poboy at this shop is $4.00, and if you buy five of them, you get one free. The shop is primarily for carry out, but they do have a couple tables where you can eat. This option may appeal to you if you're really hungry, or if you're an artistic type that likes to hang out at dives and order a black coffees at a gas stations.  The House Special (#1) is delicious. Its protein is three types of thinly sliced Vietnamese deli meats which I am wholly unqualified to identify. The Marinated Pork (#6) was equally delicious and is my recommendation for those with a less adventurous pallet.  Both poboys were dressed with a slight amount of mayonnaise, fresh jalapenos, julienned carrots, cucumber, and what I believe to be shredded sweetly pickled radish. None of those things individually sound particularly appealing to me, but the combination is in fact on point. They come with cilantro as well, but because my genes make cilantro taste like dish soap, I had them hold that. My poboys were just spicy enough to contribute harmoniously to the flavor complexity of the poboys without burning my mouth in the least. That being said, the shop uses fresh jalapenos, which, by their nature have a lot of variance, so don't blame me if your poboy turns out spicier than a drunk drag queen at a quinceniera. I've had that happen too in past. The best part of the poboys is the thin baguettes they come on, which I believe are baked on site. In any case, plenty of people come here just to buy their baguettes. I have also tried their sardine poboy and their pork roll (sausage) poboy, both of which I also recommend. The shop sells various Vietnamese baked goods and desserts, and their cold bento box is particularly popular with the Vietnamese clientele. I tried it once, but my Western pallet just wasn't suited for many of those novel flavors. The Thai coconut juice is something I wouldn't get again, but the shop has a decent selection of Asian cold drinks to choose from.  Dakao Sandwiches is a gem, if not a hidden gem, right in the middle of Chinatown, and it is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Banh mi is good...just wish that there will be more meat. Banh uot is good. Services are great. Will come back again."}
{"text":"*Real rating is 3.5, but rounded up due to how friendly the counter guy was and the fact that they made my sandwich in about 45 seconds.  I walked in looking for BBQ pork, but the guy suggested I try roasted pork (off the menu item?). It was pretty tasty. Bread was great, meat was good, veggies good, etc.   I do prefer the banh mi place near UNLV that starts with a P (too lazy to look up the name), but this one was very good as well. I think I prefer the spread a little bit better at the other place.   Stupid thing I have to note... they have no diet drinks.. at all. Tons of full calorie, but no diet. I know this is just me being a calorie crazed freak so this fact in no way impacts their rating.. just making a note for others that prefer diet soft drinks."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Their coffee is pretty friggen strong so prepare yourself if you order one! Their sandwiches are amazing, and I can vouch for their #1 (House Special) and #12 (Beef Steak). You can tell the bread is fresh because it's just so soft and melts right in your mouth. Their pate is so delicious, they spread it on their House Special Sandwich, adding more flavor. They offer a lot of interesting foods from sweet rice to sesame balls, to  prepared meats and veggies. Now I want another sandwich..."}
{"text":"Pt 1: My first time here. I got the house special for my dad, the bread was crunchy and looked yummy. And my dad enjoyed it. I will definitely be back.          2/5/2016 pt 2: This is the second time they gave me the shitty bread! The reason why I go there is for their fresh baked baguette I didn't know until I got home. I mean everybody else before me got the baguette, so I didn't think anything of it. How rude of them! I go there at least 3 times a week. Grrrrrrr I took off 2 stars for the store bought bread they pulled on me again"}
{"text":"Small little shop next to Sunfood market. It's in the same plaza as Pho Saigon 8 and BBQ King.   Probably my favorite place in town to get a Bahn Mi -- though there aren't many good choices in Las Vegas. It's quick and very easy. I usually get the House Special ($3.25)... it's pretty much a combo of the ham, meat, pate, veggies, etc.   The sandwiches are actually a bit on the thin side. There probably isn't enough meat or veggies inside but the total flavor is still decent. It'd be great if they gave more meat in the sandwiches but their bread is amazing. They make it fresh daily so it's never rock hard like some places.   Would recommend orders to go. It's a really tiny space so there aren't that many tables in there for you to eat."}
{"text":"All of the Vietnamese sandwich shops that my family went to when I was young have long closed, or sold off to people who let their quality decline. So my mom and I ventured to try this place next to her hairdresser after the owner suggested this place. The young cashier speaks Vietnamese and English, so you do not need to fear the language barrier. I saw many people of all different ethnicity enter and order without issues. They are also patient enough if you are like me and get into fights with your family about who gets to pay.   There is one table inside the restaurant and two outside. This place is more of a take out venue for a quick grab and go lunch. Although it does not provide places to lounge about, it offers a wide range of excellent Vietnamese options. We ordered five special sandwiches, one meat stuffed bun, a plate of ground pork and mushroom rolled noodles, and a plate of red pork bites. The sandwiches were everything a good banh mi should be; crunchy, savory, sweet, complex, with a bite from the green peppers. The noodles are a favorite since childhood and I recommend getting some Vietnamese sausage to go with them. The steamed meat bun, after reheating, is the perfect breakfast with a cup of strong coffee."}
{"text":"This is most definitely our family's favorite place for Vietnamese Poboys. Quick and easy. I always call ahead 15 minutes and I usually order 12 sandwiches. They have a buy 5 get one free deal. I pay for 10 and get two free. The special is a great go-to sandwich but I LOOOOVE the grilled pork."}
{"text":"Price update. Sandwiches are now $3.25  they went up .25 Very peculiar experience today at Dakao. Ordered a veggie sandwich and was told not available but all other sandwiches have the same veggies.  Place is still dirty and has a peculiar smell. not from baking bread either"}
{"text":"if you know what you want, call and order ahead, cause the place is small! they have good cheap banh mi, buy 5 get the 6th free. good fresh desserts too! beside banh mi, i love their banh cuon (steamed rice roll with mince meat), so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Bread itself is good but texture of the nem nuong was soggy and spam like. It was definitely not what it should be. We asked for veggies to be on the side and they put it all in the sandwich anyway.  What made matters worst was the guy at register charged over 15% tax on 2 sandwiches. The sandwiches are $3.25 each. Total came out to $7.50 according to the cashier. We ask him why the extra dollar charge. He said it was tax. There were people waiting behind us so we didn't want to gripe over $1 but it's the principle. Not coming back to this place again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone either."}
{"text":"This place have refrigerated dessert only.  Coffee is too bitter. The place is dark and only one person working. Sandwich ia not tasty enough."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. Not what I expected. Chicken was dry, I was anticipating a BBQ chicken favor. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Sandwich was good! My friend bought me a sandwich from this place. So good I came back for more!!! Order a chicken sandwich! There's a .50 cent charge if you use s credit card. Buy 5 sandwich get 1 fit free!!! There's really no seating area. So order and go!"}
{"text":"Dakao is banh mi heaven.  So far, I've tried the #1, the vegetarian, and the #6 bbq pork.  The bread is FANTASTIC, the service is friendly and super fast, and the price is awesome.  BBQ pork is my favorite, followed closely by the #1 house special.  Vegetarian is not bad by any stretch, I just wasn't a fan of the texture (tofu, mushrooms, and some kind of slaw?). Sooooo happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"Sadly, the only place in town for decent Banh Mi.  Bread is decent, fillings are ok, butter and pate are below average.  But put them all together, the bread save the sandwich.  This place would not make a top ten list if compared to orange county banh mi.  For Vegas, it's decent.  Here is my tip for ordering at this place.  Get the cold cuts, ask for extra meat ($1), you can actually mix the meats you want.  If you don't, you will not get a decent and substantial sandwich.  If you wanna go crazy, cuz sometimes, we want more, get the extra meat, and ask for extra egg.  Now, this might be too much for one person to finish, eat half and save the other half for later."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of banh mi in Vegas, which has a lot of choices, and never felt strongly enough to rate any of them. But I'm happy to give the thumbs up to the #10 at Dakao. This place is a real hole in the wall. Just grab your sandwich and go, nothing to see inside, but the #10 is great: scrambled egg and sausage, with the usual yummy veggies. This one I will be going back to, unlike the others I've tried. The only drawback is that they don't serve those fruity slushies."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are the best in town as far as i know.  The staff are fast and pleasant, not fast and rude or fast and mean and scary like some cashiers tend to be in the Vegas Valley.  I must warn you, the shop is very difficult to find as it isn't clearly labelled as a banh mi ba le or even \"sandwich shop\" on any of the plaza signage.  It is nestled in to the right side of Annie's Hair & Nails in such a way that if you blink or get something in your eyes, it is invisible and you have to call Captain Kirk for resources.  JK.  I love these po boys at this cute little shop! Reminds me of back in the day in L.A. or LA-  both!!"}
{"text":"They have quite good banh mi but their service was sux, 15 mins waiting for 3 special sandwiches and they gave the girls who ordered after us the banh mi first WTH?"}
{"text":"They don't have much of a selection here but the sandwiches are really affordable and good.  They bake their bread everyday, and you can buy just the baguette.  I think they put jalapeno in their sandwiches so if you can't handle spicy you should let them know.  I like their grilled pork and the pork skin sandwich, I also like to get their Vietnamese iced coffee and a young coconut."}
{"text":"Friendly Sandwich shop. Try the BBQ pork or beef Sandwiches. Buy 5 get 1 free. you'll like their \"A\" HEALTH RATING!"}
{"text":"Pretty good bahn mi, but they are kind of skimpy with the veggies. Make sure you ask for more! The grilled pork and grilled steak sandwiches are both pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Mostly, if you're going to a banh mi store, you'd stick with the banh mi.  However, the banh uot here are quite good.  Made like my mother used to make at home.  The only shortfall of that dish is the weak nuoc mam.  But I think that must be due to them altering for the western palate.  The banh bao had a nice skin (moist), but it lacked solid flavor.  The sardine sandwich I got was the best part of the meal.  Should be eaten immediately though, since the sauce causes the bread to go mushy."}
{"text":"I don't have Vietnamese sandwiches that often but suddenly had a craving for it. Found this place on Yelp decided to give this a try. I got the #1  House Special which is $3.75, and got a noodle dish that's on the shelf and a fresh made pork roll for a total of $16. The sandwich is a bang for your buck for at footlong you can't beat the price. It's very flavorful, can't wait to try their other sandwiches next time. The only complain I have is the parking in that plaza is horrible. I was lucky to find a spot there at lunchtime otherwise I will have to park on the side streets."}
{"text":"In my opinion, I prefer Dakao Sandwiches over Lee Sandwiches for the following reasons:  + shorter wait (Lee's Sandwiches can take up to 30 minutes in line plus waiting for the food - I never understood why. It's not fairly cheap and great tasting.)  + tastes better (I usually order a combo sandwich and the meat in this sandwich tastes so much better at Dakao).  + they sell other various vietnamese meats and foods as well. It's the fresh kind of stuff and not the packaged things.  + buy 5, get one FREE!"}
{"text":"Good but not great.  $3.50 for a sandwich and buy 5 get 1 free is an awesome deal.  I ordered the #1 classic banh mi.  It was a good sandwich but nothing IU would go out of my way for.  Meat was tasty but the bread seemed s limp and needed to be toasted.  It lacked the light crispy and flakiness of a classic baguette for banh mi."}
{"text":"I was here maybe a week ago and the guy that worked at the front is nice but I don't really like the way they do their line system. I Order my food and when it was time to get my drink he told me I could go to the refrigerator and pick a drink as I walked over there and grab a bottle water and came back five other people were being taken care of and here I am waiting in line again for him to finish all these five people before checking me out. I've already waited in line before I ordered and now I have to wait again because I went to go get a drink. They need to improve on that and not have to make someone wait all over again just because they went to go grab a bottle water. Also when I ordered my sandwich with sunny side up eggs and Chinese sausage sandwiches he said it was extra for sunny side up eggs and extra for sausage which was fine I have no problem with that. But when I receive the sandwiches it was missing sausages and when I told the guy at the front about it but I guess since it wasn't the original guy that checked me out the guy told me that they normally don't put sausages with the Sunny Side eggs. I know that and I paid extra just to have the sausages put in there so I would like to be able to have my sausages which I ordered. Overall they were nice about it and I did like the banh cuon there.  I will come back again and hopefully they will improve this time."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese sandwiches that I've ever had other than my moms. I ordered the buy 5 get 1 free and I'm so glad I did.   I just ordered the black eyed pea sweet rice with coconut milk was heaven.  It is a delicious sweet dessert pudding similar to rice pudding but 10X better.   Just tasted the bbq beef one and WOW was it good. I think the bread makes it for me. The outside is crusty yet the inside is airy and very light. The meat with grilled onions is very tasty almost like a Vietnamese grilled cheesesteak without the cheese and a whole lot better than some of the best cheesesteaks I've had. The pickled daikon & carrots are sweet with a little tang and the cucumber, jalapeño. & cilantro gives the sandwich a FRESH taste that leaves your mouth filled with a refreshing yet very tasty palate. If you share half like I did with your significant other you're gonna wish you hadn't.   The Dac Biet sandwich has the pate, steamed pork meat, and homemade ham with all the goodies they put in with all their sandwiches.  Meat was skimpy and if you overload it, it wouldn't be as good.  It was just the right amount to have a tasty yet fresh taste.  I have yet to taste the other 4 sandwiches but I'm sure they'll delight me as we'll as the 1st one.   Dakao makes their own bread which is fantastic and the woman who makes it in the back wears a mask which I approve. The strip mall is not that clean but the pleasant woman (speaks very broken English) who takes your order and the delicious sandwiches & snacks makes you forget the uncleanliness.  I look forward to duplicating their homemade mayo and sandwiches.  It will be difficult because it is very hard to find great french bread that doesn't feel like a rock."}
{"text":"Delicious! Stopped in here on a whim and the sandwiches are amazing. Crispy bread and perfectly grilled meats. Yes and yes!"}
{"text":"They are very proud of their bread here, which is advertised as a new batch every 45 minutes (as I recall... anyhow, baked fresh throughout the day). If bread is the main thing about a bahn mi to you, you will be happy. It explodes in a shower of crumbs and after I ate my two sandwiches sitting on the floor at the airport the rug looked like it had snowed.  But if you're into fillings as I am, you'll be disappointed. They are pretty meager. I had the #1 dac biet and #7 pork and pork skin and both were very very slim on the meat and sauces and not much more generous with the vegetables. I also asked for it \"extra spicy\" and my sandwiches barely registered on the Scoville scale.  Net net, I'm giving it a 4 rather than a 3 (my true score) because the bread really is special, and the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"This is a very unassuming little shop. I have had them bookmarked for some time, but finally got the chance to pick up a little something for lunch.   I tried the BBQ pork banh mi. They take credit Visa and Mastercard with a minimum $8 purchase. They advertise that their bread is baked fresh every 45 minutes and you can tell. It's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sandwich is quite large as well, compared to some of the other banh mi places I've been to, the prices are really great as well. Just $3 for every sandwich on their menu.   Definitely a great deal, I'll be coming back again soon to get my banh mi fix on."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick lunch before a haircut a couple of days ago. I was pretty excited to see that they don't only have banh mi, but they also have banh cuon, xoi, nem chua, and other Vietnamese specialties for takeout as well. We ordered 2 banh mi dac biet (the house special sandwich) and a couple of trays of banh cuon.  The bread for the banh mi was really good - crispy but soft. The sandwich overall tasted fresh and well-balanced, not too salty. You do get more bang for your buck at Lee's (more meat), but I preferred the more authentic flavors and better balance of meat / veggies / bread here.   The banh cuon seemed fresh when I bought it, but since I bought it to go and ate it for dinner later that day after putting it in the refrigerator and reheating it, I couldn't really tell you. It wasn't bad by the time I got to it.   Just a heads up, there isn't really anywhere to sit and eat. We ended up going to Greenland market down the street and sitting in their foodcourt to chow down.   It seemed like a lot of people called in their orders and just came in to pick up their food - seemed like regulars, too. The man working the cash register wasn't rude, but he was pretty unfriendly (not surprising, I'm used to that), but it just wasn't 4-star service. In this day and age of yelp, service is paramount and the food wasn't SO good as to be able to stand on its own.   Next time I'm in Chinatown, I'm definitely going to stop by here to stock up on this taste of home."}
