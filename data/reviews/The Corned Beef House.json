{"text":"I have eaten at the Woodbridge location 3 or 4 times and loved it so much that we drove from Markham to Aurora to try the new location. What a waste of time, gas, and money that was! I was starving and so excited. Only to receive a BLUBBER sandwich. I literally had to spit it out into a napkin. Super disgusting. I mentioned the issue to the waitress and nothing was rectified.  I was offered another sandwich but declined as i did not want more blubber. Never again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good place. Very simple looking but I loved their sandwiches. We ordered the Montreal smoked and roast beef sandwich. Their sizes come in skinny, regular, gigantic and colossus . 
We got regular and gigantic. They also have different mustards. I really enjoyed the roast beef. You could really taste the meat with this one. The Montreal smoked beef needed a bit of flavour but overall I liked the place a lot"}
{"text":"Food was good and fast a bit expensive . I really doubt my 10 Oz sandwich was anywhere near 10oz 
Bread was stale and dry . 
Will give it another shot. 
Bit was hoping for much better."}
{"text":"I had a Ruben, which I had been craving for a while. Didn't know this place existed, just happened to be driving past and stopped. Food was fresh, the sandwich was so tasty!! I don't mean to be dramatic but it came with one of the best pickles I've ever tasted haha. My complaints would be I found the sandwich a bit greasy. I'm assuming the sandwich is fried, or put in a grill. I appreciate the sandwich being warm so next time I would ask about that. It's definitely not a deterrent!!!"}
{"text":"My friend kept sending me pictures of massive deli sandwiches making me drool jealousely. He told me Corned Beef House in Woodbridge was the place to go. I showed up on a Friday at 3:54pm and the door was locked. I was confused as the website said they're open from 11-7 Mon-Fri. Then I spotted their time sign on the door and all the 7's were changed into 4's. 

This is a LLBO establishment. What kind of place serves alcohol yet closes at 4pm. Anybody that came for drinks will surely have some more things to do between 4pm and bedtime so this place pretty much promotes drinking and driving.

I understand they must get their buisiness primarily during lunch hours during the work week but 4pm! C'mon... 
its obvious that this place caters to the local workers who can't get through their day without a beer cause if they didn't serve beer they surely wouldn't last as a buisiness with those hours."}
{"text":"Anytime you can make a sandwich at home that's better than a sandwich shop that specializes in sandwiches is not good. I made the horrifying mistake of getting the 10oz turkey sandwich. The bread most have been 6 oz alone and the turkey was the shiny nitrate infused style you get prepackaged from no frills. Sandwich would have been significantly better if they used a roasted turkey. 
I have to say I'm pretty disappointed because I was actually looking forward to trying this place out but definitely chose the wrong sandwich. Please do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake I did and get the turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"I went by yesterday and picked up a Smoked Meat on an onion bun after my morning shift. Takeout service was quick (probably 5 minutes at most) and this was the beginning of the lunch rush. I brought the sandwhich home and ate it.  I have to say the smoked meat is my new favorite and will be ordering it again real soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I were not sure where to go however after looking at the yelp rating/review we stopped in for a quick lunch. First the service was friendly and extremely quick. I had the club and my husband got the corn beef. My club came in with fries (excellent home cut, crispy and golden brown). I had rye bread that was fluffy and just the right thickness. Overall both my husband and I would defiantly recommend and come back for seconds."}
{"text":"The Corned Beef House has apparently been around for ages and is literally a 3 min drive from my work.  Seeing as I love deli sandwich today was the day that I would discover this gold mine.  So I called in to preorder my meal and I ordered a Montreal smoked meat platter which includes the sandwich, fries, coleslaw and a pickle.  Now I've had my fair share of deli sandwiches but this place offers many different sizes.  I didn't order the largest and I didn't order the smallest.  When I finally got back to work I realized the bag was a bit heavy lol.  Out came the fresh cut fries which would feed 2 people easily.  Then came the coleslaw and the same it could feed 2.  The pickle was typical.  The I unleashed the monster.  The sandwich was HUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.  Fresh bread juicy smoked meat and just the right amount of mustard.  All I have to say is I would love to see how large the biggest sandwich is.  Overall great experience although I didn't finish everything I would deff order the same thing again.  Maybe a smaller sandwich this time."}
{"text":"Like meats? Go here and enjoy. It's what you hope for when getting corned beef. Saw it on the map search and had to check it out.....glad I did!"}
{"text":"third visit smoked meat was more fatty (some do like this) but not my preference, called ahead so will be sure to denote how I like the meat in the future."}
{"text":"Try it for your next fix of a lot of meat stacked on bread. I'm always impressed at how real corned beef sammy's are twice as high as they are wide. The Corned Beef House is no different-meat piled high. 

If you get a platter, expect a big plate loaded with fries and coleslaw. I've had it both ways- just the sandwich and as a platter. Price wise, it's a spendy lunch, but comparable with some of the places downtown.  The next closest place I have found for all the fave sandwiches is in Richmond Hill. 

Next time I'll try a Reuben."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches at great prices! We had a party of 3 for an early dinner on Sunday.  Ordered the Montreal Smoked Meat, Corned Beef, and my personal favourite Rueben Sandwich.  The Platter comes with fries and coleslaw, or you can have the sandwich by itself.  They have a generous portion of fries, and an average appetizer size for the coleslaw with a pickle on top.  Out of the 3 sandwiches the Reuben is by far the most favourful and a much heavier/filling sandwich, with saucraut, a slice of swiss cheese, and ranch dressing.  The meat in all 3 were tender as one should expect.  The Montreal Smoked Meat has the smokieness and ground pepper that you would expect.  The Corned Beef had less flavour, but if you want something that tastes less salty that might be the option for you.  All in all, the food was great and the service was nothing less than perfect.  The server was very attentive and came to check in on us a few times, and swiftly brought us everything that we asked for.  Looking forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Visited the place twice in the past and will definitely go back for more.  

Reuben on an onion bun is a perfect sandwich IMHO.  My taste buds definitely give a nod of approval.  Fries were OK but again I was not there for the fries.  Tasty fresh coleslaw was a nice touch as well.  

A bit pricey for a quick bite but it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Came here because my boyfriend was getting his car serviced next door. The place was nice and had some comfy booths. The food was amazing, people were nice. Would deff come back every time we get the car serviced!!!"}
{"text":"A true authentic deli experience.  I just recently found this little hidden gem in Woodbridge.  Their sandwiches are incredible in both taste and serving portions.  And to top it all off, the prices are very reasonable.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"As a party of 3, came here on a Sunday evening for dinner around 5:15PM... didn't know they closed at 6PM so I guess we had just made it!

There are a selection of meats on the menu (montreal smoked, roast beef, corned beef, Rueben, etc).. we did not know the differences so we asked our friendly server and she was more than happy to describe the differences. There's also different breads to choose from (light rye, dark rye, marble).

We ordered one 7oz sandwich and two 7oz platters (comes with coleslaw and fries).. it was plenty enough for the three of us. The fries were very crispy and delicious.. and the coleslaw was great.

Overall, I am very impressed with this place and will likely be back as the service was great and food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. All good if that's the case but would be good for the waitress to check in at least once to let us know they have'f forgotten about us.
Still, waitress was friendly.

Food was good. If comparing to the famous, Shwartz Deli in Montreal, I would say that the bread is cut a tiny bit thicker than ideal and there could have been a bit more meat on our sandwiches. The meat should be falling off the sandwich and the bread should take a back seat to it. 

I'll go back again. Hope they can sort out the service and dial in on the small things with the food that do make a big difference."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwich shop, super fresh and tasty! The fries are to die for too :) I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4.5 stars. I enjoyed being here. 

I visit Aurora at least once a month. A while back, this restaurant's Instagram followed my account. I decided to reciprocate. I love decent deli sandwiches that remind me of being in Montreal. 

A few weekends ago, I decided to visit the restaurant. It's in a quaint area of eateries and small stores. 

I went up to the counter to look at the menu board. The woman asked whether I was placing a takeout order or dining in. I went with the latter and was shown to a table. 

The menu was on a plastic, shiny board. Everything looked good. 

I asked what the house special was. I'm glad that I did!

I ordered the house special, which consisted of seven ounces of Montreal smoked meat. I chose rye bread for my sandwich. It came with bacon poutine and a dill pickle. I ordered a Diet Coke to wash it down.

My sandwich was delicious. The meat was tender and flavourful. The bread wasn't soggy! I also enjoyed the bacon poutine. So good. All of it was gone. 

I enjoyed having a leisurely weekend lunch here. The music was perfect. I quietly hummed along to Stevie Wonder. 

Washrooms are clean. Folks are friendly. I'd come back again to try more items off the menu.

It's great when your hung over af  will def be coming back ! Even thanked the kitchen staff , a bit pricy but it's Quality"}
{"text":"Great food and only place in Vaughan you can get a decent Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich. Only wish that they were open later during the week. I am pretty sure I went there for 7pm one night and they were closed."}
{"text":"Great lunch place. Good menu. Cherry coke. Prices good. Nice interior and staff. Corn beef is amazing. Always full."}
{"text":"Eating Corned Beef Sandwich at The Corned Beef House which has the first location opens in Downtown Toronto since 1978.

The meat was soft, tasty and warm. Quality of meat is good. A \"Giantic\" 10oz Platter at $17.95, could be more giantic. The fries was really good too, perfectly crispy outside and just soft inside. 

Service here is super fast!! The only place I really been asked 3 times as they ready and eager to take my order! Great if you are here if you are in a rush.

Good choice of local crafted beers from Amsterdam, Beau's etc. It would be helpful if they have a menu of what's available instead of having customers asking every time."}
{"text":"Now that's a sandwich!  Having simply driven by and caught my eye, I love sandwiches and anything deli style.  
Décor is nice a suits the place.  Servers were polite. Courteous and friendly.  Sandwich was delicious, filling, and hearty. I did like the thick bread they used. I plan on coming back to sample some other goodies on the menu.  
Well done. Good sandwich."}
