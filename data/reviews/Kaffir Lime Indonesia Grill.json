{"text":"Very authentic tasting food so far. I've been three times.  First, I had the rendang and second time I had the fried rice Medan. The guy is from Medan, so the food has got to be good. (bias. Sorry). Don't forget to ask for a side of sambal. The veggie side is great and I am not really a veggie person. When in doubt, get the beef anything."}
{"text":"I've travelled through out Indonesia......this is better than the food you will find once you've travelled there! Primarily it is the fresh ingredients from the farmers market that make it amazing. I know I shouldn't compare this to thai food, but this is better than any thai food i've had in Calgary hands down. Support this great little shop and you will be rewarded with authentic flavors of the east."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's take me this long to write a review for this place. If there's any restaurant that's deserved a review from me, a simple customer with endless love for their food, Kaffir Lime is the place. Generous helpings enough to fill me, but definitely not enough to share haha. You know that high or tired feeling you get after your eaten too much like at Thanksgiving? Kaffir Lime does it with a lot less food but I assure you the food will give you an orgasmic high - I'm not kidding, I or any person I've introduced this place to has moaned at least 5 times while eating their food... TMI? hell no, this is Yelp!

Their braised beef is RI-DIC-U-LOUS! their saffron rice is the best I've ever had and what the heck do they out in their salad dressing that makes it taste so good!?! 

This isn't Indian food, it isn't chinese food, it ain't Filipino food and it isn't Dutch ;) Indonesian / Malay food is very rich in flavor; I can't get enough.

there was a time when I ate here religiously every Thursday for several months straight. Yes, I ordered the same thing because why do that to myself?! haha I want the same thing because it tastes so good.

Why oh why didn't I write this review on Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday when they were open?! it's only Monday and I just made myself crave their food... I guess it will just taste that much better on Thursday!!! hahaha"}
{"text":"I love the food very much. It is very tasty, beautifully spiced and the portions are generous. It's on my list of weekly craving to be safistied!
At times, it gets a little busy and waiting may occur but it's well worth the wait. Just go shopping at the market and your food will be ready when you come back!
It's about time that Calgary gets an Indonesian restaurant as delicious as Kaffir Lime.
The staff is very friendly too."}
{"text":"As a Calgarian, it is not very often that you find Indonesian cuisine in this city, and when you do, as unique as the food is, it often lacks in quality. I can gladly say that Kaffir Lime does not follow this trend.

The food here is amazingly fresh, and filled with a powerful palette of flavours. I ordered the Rendang Daging, a traditional beef curry with coconut and an array of spices, with coconut rice and an Indonesian salad called achaar with a drop of sambal chili sauce. The beef is tender and filled flavour that just melts in your mouth. The rice also has that buttery texture that pairs so well with the beef. The achaar compliments this by adding a fresh crunch with the vegetables. The sambal provides a satisfactory spice, even to someone who has an Indonesian background! 

With all of the colours in this dish, it looks like it would be categorized as a light meal; however, looks can be deceiving. The portion given is quite large, which is also amplified by all of the spices. If you're looking for a party in your mouth though, Kaffir Lime will definitely not disappoint!"}
{"text":"My favourite. I always stop by when I am in the area. The chef/owner always remembers me and my daughter (even though I am rarely there). I love the Tempeh dish .. so perfect everytime. Terimah Kasi!"}
{"text":"It's refreshing to see an Asian food vendor that can execute food consistently, holding back nothing for the sake of  being in a foreign market. Often with many places, flavours are compromised in an attempt to have a broader appeal. Delicate flavour profiles that balance the sweet, sour, spicy and salty are often much too sweet or terribly bland and unexciting.

Enter Kaffir Lime.

Owner and chef, Junian operates this tiny Indonesian eatery in the atrium of Kingsland Farmers Market making some of the most flavourful, fresh and unforgiving Southeast Asian cuisine in the city. Bold curries with deep and complex flavours, paired with the ethereal and aromatic perfume of the delicate jasmine rice. Add to that, the kiss of lime, lemongrass and fresh cilantro on farm fresh greens and you have yourself a meal to remember.

There is always a regular selection of signature items on the menu, including the satays and the ever famous vegetarian dish, Gado Gado. The specials are always changing and there is always something delicious cooking in Junian's tiny kitchen. The ingredients are always fresh and scratch made. Junian's chili sambal is unbelievably hot and the difference between his version and the jar is like night and day. He also makes his own peanut sauce which captures the essence of the roasted peanuts. Awesome.

Must try dishes:

Beef Rendang - a savoury beef curry simmered with coconut milk until fall apart tender, made from Hoven Farms beef

Black Pepper Lamb - a slow cooked tender and juicy lamb in a black pepper sauce

Gado Gado - Shredded cabbage and fresh vegetables with baked tofu and tempeh, topped with a fresh homemade peanut sauce

*always order extra sambal  - Junian will always ask

My only complaint is that the Market is only open from Thursday to Sunday."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place today! Ordered their lone veg offering, a Gado-Gado plate. Man, was I bummed initially when it turned out to be a green salad smothered in peanut sauce. Seriously? Not even a lone tofu cube? Didn't Indonesians invent tempeh?

But what magical peanut sauce it was! The two tapioca crackers it came with were tasty too. It made the shredded cabbage palatable! I nearly cleaned my plate, and the sambal olek added just the right kick (even though I absentmindedly put the entire tapioca cracker it was served on in my mouth. HELLO, I'M AWAKE NOW). 

Minus one star for the lack of protein (aside from the peanut sauce on the plate)."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the food at Kaffir Lime. It is fresh, colourful and super flavourful. Indonesian isn't a type of food i'd eat everyday but occasionally when the craving hits I know I can expect a consistently delicious meal."}
{"text":"Whenever I talk \"food\" with people, everyone seems to have a handful of places that they greatly swoon over because it's ultimate comfort food. You know, their \"secret places\" they only divulge to you when you finally win them over and convince them that you're no impostor.

If you hear me say the words \"You gotta check out Kaffir Lime\", then realize, that I think you're allright ;)

I love this place. Period.

{"text":"You ever go into something with no expectations and then get completely blown away?  That's exactly my delicious experience with Kaffir Lime. Yum! 

 You also know that realization that you haven't eaten anything yet, and maybe, just maybe, that's why you're so friggen hungry?!? That was also me at the Kingsland Farmer's Market today. Someone told me Kaffir Lime was good, so I went there. That's all I knew...

What did I discover? Flavour, texture, and fresh ingredients!!!  I was so disinterested when I ordered, but then I took one bite and immediately went back up and had to thank him, and find out just what the heck this was? This place knocked my socks off and I didn't even know what I was eating. The chef's description didn't sell me the flavour - The flavour made me demand a description.

Well, what was I eating?? It's name is Rendang Daging, and we are in love. Organic beef slow simmered in coconut milk, with galangal cayenne cinnamon and spices. It's melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the cayenne give you a swift yet not overbearing kick to the heat sensors. So good.

Along side the beef is mixed fresh (very fresh) greens covered in a sweet, tangy and not overwhelming dressing, and that fantastic yellow coloured rice that I know absolutely nothing about are also on the plate. This was enough food to eat to of me. Even being super hungry and the food being so darn tasty I still can't believe I ate it all.  Total price - $12.50.

Food court style tables in the middle of a fluorescent lit farmers market. You're not here for the ambiance, you're here for the food."}
{"text":"I will get a lot of hate for this review..but I think it's long overdue. The food here is great and I have been here a handful of time, mostly doing take out. However, the food is not prepared in a clean manner. Cash is handled and the same unwashed hands are being used to prepare your food (witnessed this myself twice). Vegetables are not washed either. You can see the sticker still on the chopped vegetables on your plate. I got sick from this place before and was in denial but then it happened twice. If you really care about your customers please take some care in handling your food."}
{"text":"Fresh, affordable. Amazing citrus salad with perfect peanut chicken! I'm going to miss this place... definitely the best place in the farmers market."}
{"text":"Don't know what the hype is all about. Had the rendang and randow. Both came with rice and salad, the rice was dry and the salad was a slightly modified mixed green salad that you would get in those plastic containers at the grocery store. Rendang was dry, lacked flavor and sauce. The randow had much better flavor but was dry and the beef jerky like. Definitely not worth the $26"}
{"text":"Kaffir Lime is to be found at Kingsland Farmer's Market, one of the smaller and less well-known farmer's markets in Calgary. Kaffir is located in the atrium area of the market and it is where I head to when I have a hankering for Indonesian food.
It's hard to pin down Indonesian food, it is so diverse because Indonesia is a country made up of over 6000 islands and people from more than 300 ethnic groups. My mum was born and raised in Palembang which is in the island of Sumatra and there are Indonesian dishes from Sumatra that you will not get on other Indonesian islands. One of the best loved Sumatran food is pempe which is basically fish cake but served in umpteen number of ways. Diversity aside, there are common dishes throughout Indonesia such as Beef Rendang and Sate but each geographical region will give these dishes its own twist. Beef Rendang was a staple of my childhood, and it's beef simmered in coconut milk flavoured with coriander, galangal, lemon grass and a few other spices. Kaffir does a delicious version of this and serves it with nasi kuning (literally rice yellow) and a salad. The beef is tender and flavourful and the rice just flavoured with tumeric to add flavour but not overpower. It is a good compliment to the rendang. Salad in Indonesia is generally vegetables just quickly tossed in a dressing of vinegar, sugar, salt, Kaffir has mastered the blend and the side salad adds a coolness to the dish in case you find the rendang too spicy.
The official \"salad\" of Indonesia is a variety of vegetables with possibly tofu, tempeh, hard boiled eggs,  all tossed with a peanut sauce and topped with deep fried fish/shrimp crackers, The dish is called Gado Gado which really just means mix-up. This is as close to salad with dressing as you will get. The vegetables will vary from region to region but at Kaffir it is shredded cabbage and other fresh vegetables with baked tofu and tempeh.
If you have never tasted Indonesian food I recommend the Beef Rendang and Gado-Gado as a good place to start. If you are into spicy hot then make sure you ask for a side of home-made sambal (chilli sauce). Kaffir's sambal has a quick hit of spicyness that leads to a slow sensuous burn so be careful when trying it, it is spicy.
Prices are extremely reasonable, my take-out of Beef Rendang in the photo was $10 including GST. The market is only open from Thursday to Sunday. There is a small but good assortment of vendors from organic meats and vegetables to artisanal products and an interesting variety of foods such as Sushi, mexican, organic soups, asian fusion, indonesian and east indian to name a few."}
{"text":"was back here for lunch on saturday again had the chicken sate.  It was ok, again bland veggies but the handmade chili-paste kicks it all up.  The only downside on why iits lost 2 stars is because there was a bone in the chicken skewer.  I told the owner and he didnt seem to apologetic or worried, so I'd be careful and expect to find a  bone and try not to lose a tooth."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times over a few stays in Calgary and I have always been very impressed with the food. The first time we were a little surprised to see it was inside a farmers market and didn't know what to expect but after reading the Yelp reviews, we knew we had to try it.

Today, we had the rendang, a beef dish with rice and a nice salad, as well as a beef satay that had very tender beef and a nice peanut sauce. The food is very good value with the dishes costing around ten bucks and the portions are more than enough for lunch. We drove from downtown just to eat here before we left Calgary. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My wife felt a craving for lamb while we were at the Kingsland Farmers Market for the Corn Festival, so she tried the lamb at Kaffir Lime, and voted it a solid two thumbs up. You know what they say--happy wife, happy life, and my wife is something of a lamb connoisseur, so I had to give them four stars. It would be five, except I didn't order anything for myself. That's for next time."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I spent 5 weeks in Indonesia and discovered that they have some pretty darned good food. I even learned how to pronounce a few dish names. Although, that was once upon a time. Since then, all I remember is \"nasi goreng\" and \"mi goreng\", which I think are fried rice and fried noodles respectively. Don't quote me on that, I was 14.

Kaffir has a prime spot right next to all of the tables and chairs at the Market. I was there just before noon on a Saturday and was pleased to find a table and no lineup. The market was busy, but the lunch rush hadn't hit yet. Kaffir's got a small operation going, perfect for a farmers' market. There were two people working, one handling the orders, one serving them up. On this particular day, the Rendang was peering up at me from the hot tray it was nestled in. I think it even called my name. When my stomach let out a slight growl in response, I knew we had a match.

I'm by no means an Indonesian food expert, but I know what I like, and I definitely liked my plate full of shredded beef and yellow rice. It was full of flavour and spice-oh so much spice! It had my nose dripping by the end of the meal-and under $10 for a sizable portion of food. Shiver me Kaffirs! I'll be back for seconds."}
{"text":"I haven't seen Jamie in a while so we planned a shopping/farmer's market day and I invited my sister.  It was a Saturday when a snow storm hit but I braved through the vicious conditions to pick Jamie up.  We shopped at south center mall and left at about 3 to head to the farmers market.  We decided on Kingsland as it was on the way back home.

Saturday parking at Kingsland during/after a snow storm wasn't bad; I got a spot close to the door in the back.  We walked around the market for a bit and then decided to get some lunch.  Jamie is a vegetarian and she suggested Kaffir Lime.  She said it was an amazing Indonesia place that had this great peanut sauce.  I wasn't completely sold so I browsed around more.  I didn't find anything I wanted so I went back to Kaffir and never turned back.  Jamie went with what she had last time which was a vegetarian salad with peanut sauce ($8.50), I went with the chicken satay ayam ($8.95) and Danielle ordered Nasi Goreng with chicken ($10.75).  They handed us numbers and we had a seat in the shared seating area.  Jamie's salad came out first and it looked wonderful!  There was a generous portion of yellow rice, topped with salad and fresh vegetables and tofu on the side and of course the peanut sauce.  The rest of the orders came out shortly after.  I thought our plates beautiful!  They were full of color and the presentation was as if we were dining in an actual restaurant!  My plate had a portion of yellow rice with two chicken skewers on top, topped with plentiful peanut sauce with a side of fresh vegetables and a dab of red chili sauce.  Danielle's came with what looked similar to fried rice with bits of tofu, some green salad on top, fresh vegetables on the side and two skewers of chicken covered in peanut sauce.  Everything tasted amazing, there was a bit of a kick to my meal but I continued to enjoyed it a lot.  Jamie was right about the peanut sauce, it really is wonderful.  The peanut sauce has this unique taste, a mixture of peanuts, satay, and tangy goodness...just full of absolute delicious flavor!  I enjoyed mixing the peanut sauce with my rice; it's just the perfect melt in your mouth combination.  

I was pleasantly surprised with my meal at the farmer's market!  Kaffir has reasonable prices, friendly staff, and of course amazing food!  I ate every speck of food from my plate and we all left full and completely satisfied.  The only thing I could think of is that my sister and I both wished the chicken wasn't on skewers; we just wanted to dig in without any fuss!! :)  I've been raving about Kaffir to friends, coworkers, even strangers nonstop since my last visit, I really have to go back ASAP!!!  I am ever so thankful I was introduced to this Indonesian gem.  Seriously, make a stop at Kaffir Lime, you will never turn back...it really is as good as it gets!!!

ps. If you're in love with the peanut sauce as much as myself, you can go home with a container for $5! ;)"}
{"text":"Kaffir Lime is wonderful! I visited here and spoke with the very friendly staff about my \"restrictions\" as a vegan. It turned out that day there happened to be two vegan options we could have; the Gado-Gado plate Tiffany spoke of, as well as a noodle dish. My brother and I opted to get one of each and share. 
I'm bummed out for Tiff that her Gado-Gado plate did not have any tofu on it, as both of our dishes came with plenty of tofu. Additionally, I am not sure if it was included with the special or not, but they brought out a gigantic plate of salad out to our table with a very tasty vinagarette after we had already started eating. They also have Blue Monkey brand coconut water here, which I enjoy a lot always. 
The peanut sauce was delicious, and I think the noodles were my favourite part.
This was so much food for me (we even had to pack things up to go) that I wasn't able to eat for the rest of the day. FOOD COMA LYFE.

{"text":"Read about this place in Yelp.  I have been on the look out for any type of South East Asian cuisine in Calgary.  Indonesian is quite close to Singaporean food and I know my SE Asian cuisine!  We tried the Rendang plate.  It comes with the nasi kuning (yellow rice) with the rendang on the top (not bad beef although it should be a little more braised.  Ours was a little chewey still.  Came with some pickled vegetables (known as achar).  The achar is similar to what my mum makes.  Good price for a hard to make dish $8.95!  

I'd go back and try the Gado-gado next time."}
