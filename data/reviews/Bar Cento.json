{"text":"I was definitely disappointed after reading so many glowing reviews.

I came here on a Wednesday evening for a late dinner. We arrived around 9pm, and waited to be seated, as the sign said to do. After a bit, a guy came from behind the bar to see why we were waiting, and didn't know why the sign was still up. He told us to sit anywhere. No small talk, no chatting, all business.

We chose a spot and waited a bit for our menus to arrive. While they have a pretty good beer list, I thought they were all really expensive, especially for a Wednesday night. No specials were running, as happy hour clearly had come and gone.

My husband ordered a beer, but I stuck with water. Not once were our water glasses filled while we were there, so I had nothing to drink with dinner. It seemed like they were short-staffed or something, as there wasn't anyone to flag down. The one guy who seated us was behind the bar and serving other tables, so we were not checked on during our whole dinner.

We ordered 2 pizzas - a blanco and an arugula. The blanco was nothing special to me. Yes, I'm from Chicago and prefer deep dish, but the think crust had barely anything on it. The cheese was lacking, as was the garlic. My husband's arugula pizza had the opposite problem. Bar Cento cures their meat in house, and the prosciutto on the pizza was the saltiest meat I have ever tasted. We love our Italian meats, but my husband summed it up when he said he actually preferred the pizza without the prosciutto. That's a problem.

I will say the server brought our bill quickly and returned it quickly.  It was just as well - we wanted to leave."}
{"text":"First, thanks to all of the Yelpers who wrote great reviews and helped us find this gem.  Traveling across the country after the long holiday weekend and we found ourselves in Cleveland to ride out the bad weather.  Fortunately my wonderfully brilliant spouse found a charming B&B around the corner in Ohio City.  

So we relaxed a bit, unwound, and set out in the rain to find Bar Centro/Bier Markt.  Glad we braved the elements.  Sunday and Monday night have an amazing happy hour...drinks, appetizers, entrees (read:  cheap).  Great to know, epecially if you want to travel through the menu a bit.  We did.  

Started with the famous Sunnyside Pizza (voted best pizza in Ohio by Food Network), a Christmas lager from Great Lakes Brewing Company, and the arugala Cesar salad.  We could have stopped there and been very impressed.  Since we were sitting by the kitchen, we saw several cheese/charcuterie trays, dinners, and pizzas head out to other tables.  Yum.  It was heaven because it looked and smelled great.  The pizzas were beautiful, the Ohio hangar steak was gorgeous, the brisket looked like buttah, and the frites looked fabulous.  We managed the brussel sprouts and a combo charcuterie, but just barely.

If we did not need to be home soon, we would probably stay another day just to try the other half of the menu, especially the brisket and hangar steak.

Why such a good review, desire to return, and only FOUR stars?  Service.  Waitstaff was inattentive (inexperienced?).  Simply put, ignoring your table is not good service.  We are pretty clearly foodies, so please answer our questions, give us your opinion, and be a little excited that you work in a restaurant that serves great food.  Just to be totally fair, waitstaff just might be new to the business and was tentative.  Regardless, we're nicking them a star so we can be more impressed on our next visit.

So go, order the pizza, a Yuengling, the brisket, whatever.  Just brace yourselves for the waitstaff -  until you are a regular..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good brick oven pizza, it's pretty good.  The toppings were basically all tossed in the center of the pizza but overall it was really good. Our appetizer came out after our main meal but the waitress was kind enough to offer to take it off our bill.  I do feel like the restaurant tries a little too hard to be extra and anti-mainstream.  I gave it three stars because the experience over all was just pretty okay."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It can get a little backwards-hats on the weekend as 25th Street can be on especially on Saturday night, but the food - especially the pizza - is too good to pass up. I think the Bianco has got to be my favorite! My only consistent complaint of the last five years is that they just won't indicate on the menu that they deep fry in duck fat. If you're a vegetarian or just don't eat duck, you will not know unless you ask. (So the fries you ordered with your veggie burger are not vegetarian.)  Just a tip! Otherwise, great spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty sweet that u serve your $7 beer in thimbles"}
{"text":"Stay away from the muscles in wine sauce, they were so small in size and the flavoring was the worse I have ever had.
Had the regular pie with sausage,  IT SUCKED!!
THIS PLACE WOULD NEVER SURVIVE IN NEW YORK OR NEW JERSEY FOR MORE THEN 3 DAYS!!!"}
{"text":"Meh.  My pizza tasted stale and the service was terrible.   Saw our waitress twice.  Was expecting a lot more given the reviews."}
{"text":"On a recent Saturday afternoon - after watching a regatta on the Cuyahoga RIver with the family - we stopped here with 7 in our party looking for a late lunch/early dinner.  We were seated right away in a cool larger booth right near the door - great people watching in Ohio City.  The server was fantastic - explained the menu and made some recommendations.  The pizza was great - light crispy crust with tasty toppings!  We also ordered fries with dips - yummy!  The beer list was varied - we tried several great beers and ales!  We will definitely be repeat diners here!"}
{"text":"Used to give this place 5 stars until they got rid of the fingerling potatoes. When I say these potatoes were good, they were actually excellent. I got out of bed at 11 pm to go there and get some. That's how good they are. Not just that though. I appreciate the new head chef but it just hasn't been the same to me since they got a new chef. Although, I do like the direction they're going, I'm left craving more."}
{"text":"I really like this place, but as someone who lives in the neighborhood I avoid like the plague on the weekends when it gets invaded by the former Warehouse crowd. But if you go during the week the food is really good. My favorites are of course the frites, but also the Sunnyside Pizza, and the crispy chicken that is among the best I have ever tasted. The house red is a little shaky, but there are plenty of other drink options. So just avoid the weekend bar crawlers and have a good weekday meal at a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"Tried to sit down and grab one of 4 or 5 open tables tonight. They said it was a 15 minute wait. There was no one around waiting for a table. Poor customer service. We left."}
{"text":"Our first trip was around happy hour time on a Friday and it was a great experience. The pizza is excellent! However, we came back a week later on a Saturday evening and it was a different experience. The service was terrible (Pizza was still great). Our waitress did not check up on us once, and the manager came out to help tend to our table. We waited 35 minutes for our check, and when our waitress brought it, she was rude when we wanted to split the check. The atmosphere is alright in the earlier evening hours, but the bar area gets loud and messy after 7:30. Not a great spot for a dinner. Overall the food is very good, but the service and the ambiance is not. Will probably go back for the happy hour, but dinner here was a one and done. Ugh"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times, it's been excellent every time. Why?
-Rotating menu, so every time you come something's new
-Local ingredients give you that warm fuzzy feeling inside
-REALLY good pizzas
-Cheap wine list (!!!)
-You can order from Bier Markt's beer menu, so check out the board before they seat you at Bar Cento
-Good service
-You can usually see the owner there finishing the dishes and serving
-Relaxed, unpretentious, not-loud not-library atmosphere"}
{"text":"Our waitress appeared only once tonight at Bar Cento, managed to mutter a grammatically troubled sentence, and then forever disappeared for the remainder of the evening.  Her absence would have been less significant had the mere presence of decent food arrived in her stead.  Unfortunately, it did not.
         A formerly strong supporter of this restaurant, I too, have raved about the Bar Cento frites, though tonight they tasted stale, flavorless, and badly microwaved.  This, of course, did not stop me from eating every bite, but this I fear has more to do with a starch addiction than the quality of the food I was scarfing.  Let's face it, I'd run over a Krispy Kreme truck for the unlimited warm carbohydrates.  
          When I asked kindly if something were different about the fries, a totally new waiter looked at me blankly and tersely said, \"No.\"  Did he bother to ask why I wondered or whether or not they tasted all right?  The answer to this is also another unflinching \"No.\"  Donning a LeBron James \"Witness\" t-shirt, this waiter managed to ironically not see a single thing going on at our table, though if he had, he may have caught me checking to make sure my symptoms of TMJ didn't worsen while chewing.
          The pizza, rather than appearing out of a brick oven, looked like it come out of a Trader Joe's box.  This would have been all right if it tasted anything like a Trader Joe's pizza, but I found it bland and tough to chew through.  Perhaps it needed longer in the microwave as well? 
            Decades later, yet another, entirely different server presented us with a check.  I still left 20%, but since it gets split evenly by the 13 different staff members who incompetently served us, I'm not sure anyone will make much off our meal.  The next time I'm in Ohio City to eat, I'll probably just drive to Tremont."}
{"text":"Bar cento is the best! Truly original pizzas and a great wine list. You can also order off the beer list from the spot next door, Bier Markt."}
{"text":"Saturday night 715 reservation and by the time we order at 815pm they are out of not one but TWO of their 7 entrees. It's one thing to have such piss poor planning when you have a large menu but for a table of half vegetarians it's a big deal when these are your Saturday night plans for a special occasion. 

What made it even worse was the indifference our waiter had when asked about it. I understand it's not his fault as he so nicely pointed out, but accepting blame and acknowledging bad planning goes a long way to appease the customer.  It's Saturday night, not Tuesday. There is no excuse.  And to too it off, the one dessert we all wanted they ran out of too. 

Whoever is running this operation in terms of planning needs to be fired or go back to culinary management school. 

Luckily thing the manager came in, genuinely apologized, took our apps off the bill and salvaged our dinner.  

What food we did have was pretty good as it usually is."}
{"text":"Great food! Try the fries! Overpriced for quality for food, and for Ohio in general, but food is pretty good.

Staff was a little \"slow\" not in getting us our food but for understanding the human language both over the phone and in person... I may even go back..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The food is creative and delicious, and they change the menu to use local, fresh ingredients. I love the casual, cool atmosphere and the music is always great. They have a wonderful wine list and lots of great beer options too. At times you will get a server who isn't so great, but hey... everything else more than makes up for it.

Their pizzas are super delicious, they use fresh pasta with their pasta dishes, the pomme frittes are to-die-for and they always have great sides of salads, veggies and yummy potatoes. 

Having lived in Brooklyn, NY for a handful of years definitely raised my expectations of dining out, and Bar Cento is hands down my go-to spot in Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Love Bar Cento....and like most people have noted the Fries are what to get....and you have to get the mayo's that go with it....probably a zillion calories but they are soooo good!   The few times we have been there I have ordered items of the specials, last time was a great pork chop...a little dry, but the sauce and lentils it was served with was great.  Next time I need to try a pizza, but I have to save my calories as I will still have to get the fries, and pizza and fries is quite indulgent!   Also, the best place to sit is right inside near the kitchen, not in the front lobby, or not in the back room.  Also, it is great that you can order any beer from next door at Bier Markt, which has a huge selection,  my husband is a big fan."}
{"text":"\"No one on the corner have swagga like us.\"

T. I. definitely said it best, but that's how my friends and I felt during our trip to Barcento to celebrate our friend Lauren's birthday.  We were seated at a table that was surrounded by long draperies, providing a private and intimate feel for our dinner.  So much so, we gathered the experience was similar to how the girls on \"The Hills\" felt whenever they went out on the town in L.A.

Not only was the atmosphere perfect for a girls' night/birthday celebration, the food and drinks were also amazing.  We mostly ordered pizzas - I had the potato which was topped with pancetta, rosemary, provolone and of course, potatoes.  Let's just say, it made me not care that I was eating carbs, it was that good.  Not one of us with disappointed in our meals or beverages, and we loved sitting at our secluded, private table chatting over great food.
 
If you want a fun night out with the girls, or are looking for a cozy and romantic spot for your next date night, be sure to try Barcento.  You won't walk out of there with T.I. (remember, we are still in Cleveland, even though it might feel like L.A.), but you'll definitely leave feeling like a VIP."}
{"text":"First, lets clear up some naming confusion:

1: The McNulty who owns Bier Market, Bar Centro and the Speakeasy is not the owner of McNulty's bar in Cleveland Heights. When I found this out, I felt instantly better about the place.

2: Bar Centro, Bier Market and Speakeasy are really the same bar/restaurant. They should be called the 'red' room, the 'teal' room, and the 'basement.' There is some differentiation. Bar Centro (Teal) focuses on food; Bier Market (Red) focuses on, well, beer; and the Speakeasy (basement) is just the basement bar that plays loud dance music, and is only open on special occasions and most Saturdays. 

On to the review:

Decor:
Five Stars. I really enjoy being in the space. The lighting is bright enough to see clearly, but never harsh. The lamps are clever and pretty. The place has a style that is trendy but definitely its own. I can't think of another bar or restaurant that has the same feel.

Service:
Four Stars
If it's very crowded, treat the place like its a bar. Order at the bar. I think this will eliminate most of the problems people seem to have with the service. When I have had the sit-down service, it's been wonderful and attentive. They got a party of ten served in and out in about an hour. No small feat.

Food:
Four Stars
If you have ever liked eggs over-easy, and you don't have an aversion to pepper, then the Sunshine pizza is for you. I have trouble exploring the rest of the menu, because it's so freakin good. It is the perfect beer food. Other things I have had were excellent as well. You don't have to really order the Pomme Frites - just smell the fried rosemary sprigs as they march by. That's really the best part.

Beverages:
Four Stars
Tip: check out both bars before ordering a beer. They have very different drafts! It's the only real difference between Bar Centro and Bier Market.
The first time I went here, it was all Belgian style beers. Admittedly, a huge selection, including a few I hadn't had since I was in Brussels. But I'm happy to see that they throw in a few IPA style beers now.  

All in all, this is one of my favorite places down town."}
{"text":"We enjoyed great service, excellent ohio apple salad, and good pizzas. Again, the salad was a real standout. We felt this was a good place to grab a drink and some decent bar food."}
{"text":"Our service was dreadful. The host seated 3 tables of 4 people or more in front of us (table of 4) when we had reservations. He clearly forgot about us until I mentioned we had been waiting. Once served food; 2 of 4 guests got their main entre and had to ask the server 15 minutes later for the other 2 patrons food. The spicy chicken pizza was great, chicken carbonara was under-seasoned and not palatable.  Overall, I had to ask for service multiple times and the food and drinks were served late. Pretty unacceptable experience overall. I wouldn't recommend. There is better food and service elsewhere. Nobody ever really needs to come here."}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, great food! My husband and I were looking for something fun on Labor Day, and we found the right spot! Our server, Josh, was friendly and offered great recommendations (we LOVED their pappardelle pasta dish). We'll certainly be back again."}
{"text":"This is the oasis to which we escaped after our horrible experience at the Nauti Mermaid. The music was really great this time, the fries were as good as ever and so was the pizza. Great service."}
{"text":"4 Stars. Ordered the happy hour pizza and Pomme Frites. The pizza was average and the Pomme Frites were double cooked in duck fat which were good. The bar has a cool, laid back atmosphere and had many drink choices. It was also featured on DDD."}
{"text":"Bar Cento is a great restaurant in Ohio City right near the West Side Market. It shares a space with the Bier Markt. We sat at a booth in the lobby of the two restaurants, which was great because there was more space, less noise, making it easier to talk, and large windows looking out on W. 25th. We had a great waiter who provided us with great selection and just had an overall friendly demeanor. The prices were shockingly affordable. The pizzas hovered just above $10. Bread and olive oil is served when you are seated. We ordered the antipasto for an appetizer. It was excellent. It was a fairly large platter of different Italian meats and cheeses. I had the salsiccia pizza for my entree. It was great! It was a thin crust pizza with tomato sauce, Italian sausage, and cheese, prepared in a much more gourmet manner than your local Pizza Hut. It definitely had a kick to it. For dessert, I had the nutella macaroons. They were excellent. There were two large macaroons with chocolate, hazelnut, and almond flavoring in them. The only downside was how sticky they were, but they were great no doubt. If you're looking for a good dinner in Ohio City, check out the casual Bar Cento on W. 25th. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Pizza I'd great and the frites are spectacular but beware of coming in the winter because it's freezing on the front die to the door being open and closed all night long. Still, very good food and beer."}
{"text":"I love this place. I visit Bar Cento fairly often for their great beer selection, their delicious modern and traditional thin and crispy pizzas, but most of all their amazing frites. Cooked in duck fat and perfectly seasoned with rosemary and garlic, I can't escape this place without devouring an order of these heavenly fries (not by myself, of course).
Their menu is local and seasonal, so it changes accordingly. I have enjoyed everything else I've ever gotten off the dinner menu as well. They serve food until 2am, so next time your'e in the area and looking for a late night food fix, you gotta stop in, at least to try those frites!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service from the hostess to the wait staff.  Its apparent that Management is proud of the establishment and make efforts to assure everything is taken care of.  We had drinks next store at the Bier Market and then dinner at barCento.  Food was prepared wonderfully and presented in a timely fashion.  Our waiter was attentive without going overboard.  Well done!!"}
{"text":"Sunrise pizza!!! OMG!!! That pizza is superb!!! Bacon and eggs on a pizza!!?Fresh Cheese perfect seasonings too!!? Gooodness!!!I came back for that pizza alone 3 times. But other than that. All of the food is made fresh. If you sit at the bar you can see the TRUE, REAL cooks that are back there. GREAT HAPPY HOUR!!  Burgers good.fries good!! Mussels good!!! Drinks GOOD!!! PIZZAS ALL GOOD!!!  I WILL BE BACK!! AMD TO ANYONE READING THIS.....!!! IF YOUR FROM CLEVELAND OR NOT.... THIS PLACE IS WHERE YOU NEED TO GO TO!! And by the way...it is very nice decorum in there soo fellas..take ya girl,wife,momma,guys, who ever! WOMEN do the same!!!"}
{"text":"The vibe here is European and relaxed on a major bar street.  Food is good, however we were disappointed in the famous pomme frites. It was $12 for a (large) plate of French fries with a few small amounts of mayo, ketchup and mustard. When we ran out shortly and asked for more mayo and ketchup we got it. But when the check came we were surprised that we were charged several dollars for \"extra\" ketchup and mayo on a $12 order of fries."}
{"text":"Everything I have ever gotten from Bar Cento is great. But last time I went there was a different story. I got the Sunnyside pizza and it wasn't great...it was AMAZING! It was so delicious that when it was gone, I was sad. This should be the official pizza of the city of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"4 out of 5 only because the place can't really accommodate larger groups all that well. Really, a 4.5 rating. We had to wait 30 minutes past our reservation to wait for another large group to clear out. But that is about the only bad thing from my night, the rest was a treat. 

The food and service was fantastic!. The pizza's were so delicious and my burger was top notch, very fresh and cooked to perfection. I loved the yellow curry sauce they had for the fries. I thought the prices were very reasonable. 

The beer selection was great and they offered a lot of styles that paired well with the dishes."}
{"text":"Ohh...where to start. I would give 2 stars instead of 1 because I've had the pizza before and it's delicious, except for what happened on the way out. I tried a bite of my boyfriends burger and that was delicious. I ended up ordering the ricotta ravioli...it was ok. Just ok. Nothing to write home about. I had ordered a salad with it, got polenta by mistake but it looked good so I didn't point out the mistake. Overall...there are SO many great restaurants in this area that this just doesn't do it for me. I've heard rumors it's dirty and they leave food sitting out. On the way out I saw a cockroach scuttling around the floor and that did it for me. Done. Too many amazing AND clean restaurants to go back here."}
{"text":"Food was good... However, the service was by far the worst in recent memory. The soda is generic and flat. Our server seemed more interested in mocking the subpar quality of their drinks rather than point out the highlights of the menu. Refills were nonexistent. The wrong food was delivered, the boxes were slow to arrive, and the bill took another 10 minutes to arrive. It's unfortunate considering the pizza (spicy chicken) was delicious. There are far too many great places to eat down in Ohio City, I would pass on a dine in experience here."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had.  Will never return.  I had to wait a half hour to get a drink, an hour to get asked what food I wanted.  This is pathetic."}
{"text":"Paper thin pizza here...slightly undercooked...skimpy on the sauce, toppings and way overpriced for what you are getting. Not a fan!!"}
{"text":"Stick with the pizza. Plain oatmeal has more flavor than their risotto... Their steak is just as bad. I was incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"Service is consistently crap. I shouldn't have to flag down another server after eating half of my appetizer in order to order my entree. It's happened too many times here for me. Hipster shouldn't mean lazy."}
{"text":"Oh, Bar Cento. The food here is top notch. Especially since they got a new chef in the kitchen. The Ohio Apple Salad? TO DIE.  And those pommes frites and dip? Don't even get me started. But where Bar Cento always fails me is the service. I feel like every server just started working there 5 minutes ago. Their knowledge of the menu is never spot on. They can't answer questions. And they always seem just a bit too preoccupied to be waiting on you. Bar Cento would be a solid 4 stars, if the service just wasn't so off-putting. I'll always come back here to stuff my face, drink up all the drinks, and do it in one of the prettiest bars in Cleveland. But, I wont expect service that matches the rest of Bar Cento's awesome-ness."}
{"text":"We were here last week for dinner with a group of 4.  We were seated promptly in the \"lobby\" area in a booth in the corner.  There were a few other occupied booths in our area.

We got the happy hour fries (ok) and mussels (decent), and a round of drinks (good).

After that round, it took awhile for someone to come around again to see if we needed more food.  We ordered two pizzas (the Sunnyside and the Pork Ndjua) and a side (a sweet potato hash).  The pizzas were very good, actually.  The side was tiny....it cost 5 dollars but it looked like it was worth about 1.

Overall...2 stars.  Slightly warmer service would have gone a long way.  None of us felt the need to come back in the future."}
{"text":"Love it.  One of my favorite happy hour places in Cleveland.  The french fries, which are fried with big springs of Rosemary are heavenly.  I have dreams about them.  The mussels are fabulous.  Annnnnnddddd ..... the best selection of Belgian beer I have found in Cleveland.   Yum.  Slurp.  Glug."}
{"text":"Awesome draft beer selection, and fries that are oh so satisfying.  

While those are the most important things for me, I realize other people might care about...
--Other food: awesome pizza, a number of other options as well & reasonable prices all around, especially given the quality of ingredients.  plenty of vegetarian choices, but limited vegan options (the veggie burger has eggs)
--Atmosphere: casual/ classy without being boring.  thankfully not a meat-market scene
--Space: doesn't get insanely packed on weekends, which is nice
--Service: consistently great

Also they have a back room that is great for small parties, I think it's good for ~25 people"}
{"text":"Access to one of the best beer lists in town (Bier Markt), affordable diverse wine list and absolutely fantastic pub fare.  

Jonathon Sawyer (a protege of Michael Symon) does not disappoint when it comes to the menu.  Do not miss the fantastic traditional pizzas or the rosemary & garlic pommes frites (made from local Ohio potatoes no less).

House wines are satisfying and very reasonably priced.

Also, if you're a fan of digestivos, Underberg is available here (and may in fact be pushed on you by the staff!)  Think Jagermeister, except a little rougher on the way down."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were in Ohio City and Im glad we stopped at this place. The bistro steak and fries was what I ordered and it was cooked perfectly. He got a pizza and was very satisfied. Its not very often when you spend good money you can say its worth it in the end. Nice job Bar Cento!"}
{"text":"The only people who don't like late night pizza are sociopaths. And that comparison may be a little bit mean to sociopaths. So the fact that this place serves amazing pizza every day of the week until two A.M. should be enough to justify five stars right there. Not only is the pizza passable for two AM though, it's knock-your-socks-off, voted one of the best pizzas in the nation good. So Bar Cento means business people! This place elevates late night noshing to a glorious noble art. 

Décor: Large space filled with hewn wood, interesting parasols hung over the bar, and a pretty cool pressed metal ceiling at the entrance. The décor fits with the general Cleveland Craftsman aesthetic while elevating it ever so subtly.  

Food: There's not only pizza available til late. The menu has helpful boxes drawn around the stuff you can order into the wee hours, which includes salads, sides, sandwiches, fries and desserts. And, seeing as every time I ate here I was stone cold sober, I can say utterly assuredly the food here is of very high quality at any hour. The kitchen is consistent, updates the menu with creative seasonal specials, and uses fresh greens prepared surprisingly lightly for a beer centric bar. I've been amazed often by things you don't normally hear in reviews of late night pizza and beer joints: beautiful plating, great French technique, deft saucing, and creative garnishing. Bar Cento, though, breaks many molds. While many would recommend getting the fries and burgers here, I would argue you should try to stretch out of your comfort zone and try many of the plated dishes here. 
A sampling of the menu one of the last times I visited: 

Local Mixed greens with Castelvetrano olives, parmesan, oranges, almonds and white balsamic ($7). It was a fresh heaping of greens lightly dressed in vinaigrette with large segments of juicy orange and a nice scattering of nuts. The only detraction to the salad was the olives were not pitted, so that was a little awkward to eat around. 

Squid Ink Gnocchetti with baby octopus, ndjua, and sausage tomato Bottarga ($16). Squid ink is a tricky ingredient and I've never seen it incorporated into a gnocchi, so major points for creativity. The dish really melded though, and was a joy and surprise to eat. 

Ohio Beet Pizza with Bull's Blood beets, Prima Donna Cheese, arugula and lemon ($12). Bear in mind, this is a pizza you can order at 1 30 AM! And it tasted incredibly refreshing for a pizza, with a nice thin crust, heaps of arugula and a bright red minced beet sauce. Very original, and once again darn tasty. 

Ohio pawpaw panna cotta with mint gel pumpkin seed oil ($8).  Oh, come on now guys, you're just showing off at this point! Paw paws on a dessert menu?! Fantastic, unique and delicious.    

The menu changes seasonally, so there's always something new to tickle the taste buds. 

A small minor detraction is sometimes the crowd here can be a bit loud, obnoxious and drunk, but that comes with the territory of W25th. Weekdays are quieter and recommended. 

Overall: A Cleveland favorite! I love this place. It caters to many palates, can work for both bar food, a great fancier date and late night insomniac binging. You must try the pizza here, but you will not regret branching out and trying their many unique plates."}
{"text":"Ate at Bar Cento on a Saturday at 8. Made reservations for 2 and they sat us at a tiny table which wasn't big enough for an appetizer, pizza, fries & wine. I'd make sure you ask to be seated in a booth or bigger table if you're eating. Other than that this place was amazing. Their fries are delicious, as well as the prosciutto and apple pizza. Service was very good and definitely will go here again. Prices weren't to bad either."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant for my birthday on Saturday, January 24, 2015.  We were seated in the bar.  Our server was not friendly or attentative during our entire meal.  
As far as the food, some of our food came cold.  My food was inedible.  I had the Arancini and the brussel sprouts.  The Arancini had absolutely no taste.  The brussel sprouts were pungent.   
A gentleman approached our table and we complained to him.  He was unapologetic and did not even identify himself as the manager.  He left the table to check on the food that we were still waiting for and never returned to our table.
What a disappointment!!"}
{"text":"A group of 12 young ladies came to Market Garden on Sat night (6/1/13) for a Bachelorette party around 10:30PM and were asked to leave because we were distracting their customers who were eating dinner. Actually the people eating were cheering us on and were glad to have some excitement in the bar! It's a shame that the Management handled it the way they did. Not sure why you would want to lose out on service. We are a group of classy girls and felt that the way we were treated was disrespectful. Guess we will take our business elsewhere!!!!!! So if you are looking to go out with a group of people, don't go to Bar Cento/Bier Market!!!"}
{"text":"Gonna cut to the chase ... I went there for the pizza, specifically the Sunnyside pizza with the pancetta and eggs.  Idid not go there with high expectations.  A i have tried the sweet  soup that Angelo's calls pizza and the messy, but slightly better tasting stuff Danny Boy's puts out.  I had given up hope for finding decent pizza here.  Yeah, I'm a pizza snob and i believe in thin crusts.  I want pizza, not a casserole.  So, anyway, when they put they pizza down in front of me, i  was totally shocked that someone in Cleveland  knew how to make pizza.  In fact i was delighted.  I was also quite pleased with the mixed green salad i had.  Ate at the bar and the bartender was quick to note that if he didn't have what i wanted, that Bier Market probably did and that he wud be happy to get me whatever from there.  I said a magic word \"Duvel\"  ... Ah, sure enuff, The place adjacent had it on draught.  Okay, so I won't have to drive to Columbus for decent pizza anymore and that makes me happy."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best. Not sure how they can claim \"Best Pizza in Cleveland\" with an underwhelming, basic pizza. $20 for 6 average tasting raviolis is kind of insane. And worst of all, how do you serve a Veggie Burger with Frites fried in duck fat? It's not even specified on the menu, if I wouldn't have asked my server I'd never have known. That's just lazy. Also an added 20% gratuity for parties of 5 or more is ridiculous. Of course I didn't see it on my bill until after I had already added a tip. Don't get what the the hype is about here. So many other good places in Ohio City to spend your evening and your money!"}
{"text":"As a bar this is a great place to go. Duvel at $5 on Happy Hour? Awesome. Their sunnyside pizza used to be good but they are now taking advantage of their popularity and making it mediocre as best. Nothing to say about any of their pizzas... I tried them all. The pizza bianco barely had any sauce and there were all lacking ingredients and... whats about cheese? Take my advice,  don't follow the \"food network\" publicity. They were all dry and they NO LONGER LOOK LIKE the pictures from previous reviews here or like when food network showcased them. For those prices you may want to try Edisons or even Deweys! They have good quality beer but I would not spend any more $ on their lack of value food."}
{"text":"OKAY FRIEND

Went to Bar Cento with my hamster  

Our waiter was Clifford Tayne. We didn't like a beer and he helped us select

a Water 

The

Nice."}
{"text":"This is now my new favorite Cleveland restaurant!

Went here last night after hearing so many good things about it (mostly from fellow Yelpers like yourselves).  The fact that pizza was featured was a plus, because I can't not eat pizza if given the option.  I also knew about the great wine selection here.  What I hadn't realized prior (but should have; I've passed by enough times) is that McNulty's Bier Markt (a Belgian beer bar) is the other half of this place, and that they feature their entire beer menu as well.  HELLO!  Wonderful.

I know absolutely nothing about architecture or design, so I will refrain from making any technical comments about the decor, but I LOVED it.  I really liked that there were a ton of different rooms, each with a different feel.  It seemed more open and airy in the front, and more warm and cozy toward the back.  We sat right across from the kitchen which we always think is fun because then we can see all the food coming out.  I also loved how the tables were set up in a low-key, but thoughtful way: a wine glass filled with extra water; a baby carafe of olive oil; little tin buckets holding paper towel napkins and silverware, and a brown-paper sack of rolls.  So cool.  We almost missed the rolls and weren't sure if the water was actually more olive oil because it was in a dark green bottle, but we liked how we had to sort of investigate more closely to find out.  (Good thing we didn't pour water all over our bread.)

I was in a beer mood, and went for the Avery White Rascal (it's sort of a blessing in disguise that the Blue Moon was kicked, because it gave me a chance to try a new beer).  My husband, over the course of our meal, tried three different beers, all of which came in delightfully awesome glasses of various heights and shapes.  Like they should. I love that!  He got an Oktoberfest, a beer that tasted like cherries, and the last one whose name I actually remember because it was so weird: Gulden Draak (10.5% alchohol!). 

But wait, the food!  I can't even explain to you the happiness I felt from start to finish.  Let me try.

-Meat Plate (Small): My husband had this, and it looked great, but I am not a meat plate type of gal.
-House Salad: Looked appetizing, tasted very good, although would have preferred a little more variety in the greens.  Nicely dressed, very light, with parmesan on top.
-STEAK FRIES.  Are you KIDDING ME?!??!?  I haven't had fries this good since....since.........get the point?  Thick sprigs of rosemary and whole crushed cloves of garlic tossed in.  The fries are served with a traditional paper cone on the plate (made from a menu) with ketchup and three different mayos: garlic aioli, curry, and chili.  The rosemary was intoxicating.  I have never had better fries.  Seriously!  They have single portions, but when you get them for the table, they call them \"Super Frites,\" which conjured up Rick James and therefore made me laugh.

-Pizza: We ordered only one, thank god, because after those fries (which were a meal in and of themselves) I couldn't eat much more.  We got the wild mushroom, which came with pancetta and thyme.  So crisp, just the right amount of cheese and oil....so good!

For dessert we got the ice cream sampler (very steep at $9; we didn't expect to only get 4 teeeny-weensy scoops).  I'd avoid this when the rest of the desserts were only $5.  Still, the ice cream flavors (root beer, salted caramel, smoked chocolate w/marshmallows, and goat cheese w/cherries) were innovative and delicious.

The fact that we ate like pigs, got 5 drinks between the two of us, AND had dessert was sooo worth the price tag of $72.  At any \"fancy\" place, we would have definitely been paying well over a hundred bucks.

We plan to take our families here when they visit!"}
{"text":"Beet salad: fresh, dressing and cheese not too overwhelming, but the greens were overwhelming the beet partt of the salad. Nothing fancy. I give it a 6/10.

Moules Frites: pretty delicious. My first time trying it, but I would give it 8.5/10. The mussels on its own was a little too soft and left a taste in my mouth, but with the frites and dipping sauce..... really good! A very good combination and all parts of the dish should be eaten together. The frites are like fries, but seasons with rosemary and garlic nom nom

Mushroom pizza: I just got this because my co-worker wanted this. It was decent, but I would've gotten the sunny side up pizza. 

The s'mores dessert: for $7, it was rich and flavorful, but too small of a portion. It came out with sprinkles of Graham crackers, sprinkles!! Not gonna lie, it was pretty good though. 

Overall, drinks were pretty good, service was great, ambience is always chill."}
{"text":"Love coming here for the happy hour.  Delicious burger and fries cooked to order for under $10!  Just be warned in advance that lettuce, tomatoes and onions for the burger and the assortment of sauces for the fries cost extra but are well worth it."}
{"text":"I always forget how good the pizza is and then when I remind myself thats all I want to eat for months! 

Did you know they fly their tomatoes in from Italy once a week? Well...even if it isn't true that's how my waitress got me to order the Margarita pizza! It was delicious! 

Want good pizza? Go Here. Want the best fries of your life? Go Here. Want an amazing burger for $6 during happy hour? Go Here."}
{"text":"November 2011-
I just love this place...everything about it! 

First things first, be sure to make a res because it gets busy.  The service has always been fabulous for us. Everyone is so nice.  We sit by the kitchen so we can watch them cook which is always fun. 

The beer and wine lists are great. Many choices and very fair prices. We always find a great bottle of wine here. Last night it was an Orin Swift that we haven't tried before. Delicious!

We had our two favorite pizzas- Sunnyside and Sausage. They were perfect. The Sunnyside was peppery with perfectly gooey eggs. You must try it if you haven't.  We also had the charcuterie and it recently changed- it's now all housemade. Oh, so good!  

Stop at the Market Avenue Wine Bar for a drink prior to or after coming here. Love that place too. it makes for a perfect evening.

January 2012-
Another amazing Bar Cento experience...as always. This time we enjoyed two different pastas which were so amazing!  I had the mac and cheese with duck confit and broccoli rabe, and my husband had the papardelle with rabbit and Swiss chard. Just like the pizzas, the pastas are always fabulous. You truly can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Second time here, this time during happy hour.  Did not disappoint.  Drink specials and beer selections were good (let my beer brewing dinner guest lead the way).

My wife and I shared a bunch of dishes.  The beer mussels were flavorful and plump, although the version in the white wine sauce is probably slightly better.  Our bianco pizza had a great charred crust to it and the cheese was pungent and perfect.  We split a side of frittes and honestly I could have eaten the whole thing myself (these are some killer fries!).

We had been here before (as mentioned above)...the burger we shared that night was rock solid but the real star was the sunnyside pizza.  Trust me on this one, peeps...you will not be let down."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see several less than favorable reviews posted.  I've had two meals at Bar Cento and have been delighted by the food.  the first of those meals was on valentine's day (when I enjoyed the steak frites and two big glasses of red wine - I'm a meat and potatoes kinda gal) and the second this past Friday night...

My now \"fiance\" (still getting used to that...) and I had had a less than stellar day and were feeling the need to treat ourselves to some casual but decadent grub.  None of the usual places were appealing to us so we decided to see if we could get into Bar Cento.  Though the restaurant was busy, there was one table (ironically the one we sat at last time - they should put a sign with our names on it there!  Hmm...) that was seemingly waiting for us.  Joy!

I ordered the halibut at the suggestion of our server, which if you know me might come as a shock.  Up until the past few years, I didn't eat fish.  At all.  I'm still a little timid in this category but halibut seems to be one fish I can deal with texturally and in terms of how sea-like it comes off.  After ordering I was enjoying my wine & handsome companion and all the while thinking:  \"Maybe I should have ordered the burger...\"  That is, until I took that first bite.

One of the best meals I've had in recent memory, hands down.  The fish was perfectly prepared over a bed of buttery peas and cauliflower.  I opted for the side of fingerling potatoes.  At the end of the meal my fiancé just started laughing - there wasn't one SPECK of food left.  It looked like the plates had just come off the shelf.  I cannot remember the last time I've done that.  I even shocked myself.

So I'm not really sure what to tell the naysayers.  Other than, I staunchly disagree and would urge you to give it another go.  If the food isn't enough of the reason, go back for their very fairly priced happy hour (up until 7pm).  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I decided to visit this place after I came across the Food network magazine on a news stand. This place's sunnyside pizza was reported as the best pizza in Ohio, I had to go there. It is near westside market, so a very convenient location. 

We ordered sunnyside pizza, of course to taste the best in town. It was very nice. I must say this is my second best favorite pizza till now. It was very spicy with a lot of pepper on the crust. I would say it is like your breakfast in form of Pizza. It has eggs, cheese, bacon, pepper, and bread. They are just put together in a way that it looks like Pizza. It is very delicious. One pizza was good enough for two so not so expensive. 

Our server recommended non-alcoholic ginger beer, which turned out to be a very good choice. Their house wine was very good according to my girlfriend. 

The ambiance is very good and spacious. It has a patio during summer which has its own advantage. The crowd is usually good inside and outside. 

I would have given them 5 stars but I took one off due to the smoking. I dont know where and how but there was a constant smell of cigarette smoke at out table and it was becoming strong intermittently. I dont mind people smoking but I dont like to be around second hand smoke."}
{"text":"It is time for an update, don't you think? Bar Cento continues to be my go-to upscale dining, boozing, and all around good time Cleveland location. For starters, it is easy on the eyes. Not only are the other diners usually spiffed up, but the decor offers soft lighting. 

You might be aware, although I am a bit sheepish about it in my reviews, I have special dietary needs. Bar Cento's menu consistently offers enticing veggie sides that are made simply, and naturally gluten free. The staff is always sweet to me when I ask questions about the menu, something that I'm sure can get overwhelming, and the staff has offered to make substitutions without me even asking. For example, I always thought the mussels, with a beer broth, would not be for me. Can't have beer? They suggested using white wine. I couldn't believe they'd make such a change to the recipe for me. With the explosion of special diets, many of us have picked up on a bit of a backlash. I'm sure the backlash is a result of rude customers, and the resistance has been very, very small. But, it is still nice when people are welcoming."}
{"text":"Well I had very high hopes based off the menu and some photos I saw on here. Visited on a Monday evening and it was very slow it seemed. By that I mean not a big crowd. I ordered frites and mussels as an appetizer. Frites were solid and good although ones on the bottom were swimming in a butter sauce. The mussels were just ok. Several were empty and just shells. The others were just soggy and not that great. I then ordered a pizza with eggs on it. It sounded delicious. When it arrived it looked good but had no flavor whatsoever. The bartender asked me if I wanted anything for the pizza like hot sauce. He must have known it was going to be bland as hell. I would not order it again, without hot sauce it would be awful. Such a let down as the area was trendy and so was the restaurant it seemed. There was just one bartender so when two couples came at the same time the one had to wait a very long time to get waited on. The had to sit and watch as several bus boys and kitchen staff stood in front them at the bar watching the basketball game while the sat there not waited on. They looked frustrated to have three people literally standing inches away watching basketball but not taking their order. Just a shame for such a nice place."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had was yesterday at your bar, both bartenders were rude and condescending."}
{"text":"Specialty pizzas are great provided that the kitchen staff does not burn the crust.  The smoked beet salad is a hit.  And the French fries?  NEVER miss ordering those things!"}
{"text":"Okay, let me start by saying I love their food and we will be back for sure, 100%.

Ambiance- great neighborhood, wonderful decor, laid back vibe: 5 stars

Food - we started w/ the pomme frites; they were beyond. perfectly cooked and served with 4 wonderful sauces (okay 3 aiolis and ketchup). I will go back if for no other reason than to get these and a drink.

Marinara pizza- we added basil and we loved every bite of it. super sweet tomatoes and the perfect amount of cheese on a cracker crust. perfection

Sunnyside pizza- holy balls. we went for the fries and were intrigued by this pancetta fried egg pizza and i have to say, it didn't disappoint. This pizza was so rich and decadent and perfect and wonderful. The cracked black pepper that was used heavily was heavenly. This is one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I'll put it against a Chicago deep dish any day and say it is right up there w/ Di Fara's pizza in Brooklyn. Yes, yes, yes. Everything about this was right.

5 stars on food!

Service- abysmal. just the absolute worst. while our bartender/server was nice he wasn't very good at the service side of it. we both ran fully out of water for a long, long time. (someone else actually filled us up) and we both ran out of booze at different times during our dinner. we were having such a great time though and loved the food so intensely it didn't bring us down too much, but I will be hopeful to have a different server the next time we go.

Music- they had a killer 60s setlist on rotation. it was outstanding.

oh- make a reservation, they fill up!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty hip. If you and your friend are looking for a place with a huge selection of beers, nice atmosphere, and above average food,come here. 

I won't really say much about the drinks, because they are awesome and everyone knows it.  The food however is not sooo awesome, it's good, but not great. We got the Frites, mussels, and the sunnyside pizza.  The frites were pretty good and they had a nice selection of dipping sauces.  The mussels were average ( I don't recommend ordering these). Finally the sunnyside pizza was as delicious as everyone says, BUT some slices were incredibly peppery."}
{"text":"The sunnyside pizza is, without a doubt, the best pizza in the city! Provolone, pancetta, eggs... Smother it in Sriracha and you'll see what I mean. If rosemary are garlic are your thing, the potato fries are also the best around!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is lately, but i feel that Bar Cento is becoming really hit or miss. We've been coming here for the past three years and I have started to question whether anything beyond their pizza is worth having.

So let's start with the pizza: it's delicious! Certainly not the best pizza in Cleveland but not the worst either. If you're here to enjoy their amazing beer selection, you can't go wrong with one of their pizzas.

However, prices and quality for main entrees just don't seem to match up. I had a garden burger here once that was so salty I couldn't even swallow it. The penne verde I had was super fresh pasta, but the sauce was on the saltier side and the lemon was a bit too overpowering. Was it good pasta? Yes. But maybe not $22 good pasta.

My husband loves coming here for the steak frites. Not sure what happened or if the recipe changed, but this time it was coated in a basalmic glaze that just didn't seem right compared to how the steak has been prepared before.

I'm not sure if there is a different chef here compared to when we would come here before. I think pizza and the sides (their frites and dipping sauces, as well as the Brussels sprouts, were to die for) are certainly the way to go, but I'd be weary about entrees."}
{"text":"Normally love this place for late night breakfast pizza,  it is truly awesome.

This past Saturday night was quite a different experience.   We were a party of eight (4 married middle aged couples). When we entered there was no hostess at the door.  We made our way back to the bar area and there was plenty of room so we sat down.  (It was like 11ish).   After a about 10 minutes one of our party asked the bartender if we could possibly get a server and he very politely told her of course. 

A few minutes later an attractive young women came over to the end of our table and asked if we had seen a hostess before we sat down, I replied trying to be funny  \"not unless she was the large black gentleman who held the door open and welcomed us in\" (which is what happened.).   She very sternly informed us that no!! she was the hostess and that we should have stood at the hostess station and waited to be seated.  Mind you we were in the bar area not the dining room.  One of our party suggested that we could easily get up and go back to the hostess station and wait, he was told that he was stupid and that was a stupid idea.  She then turned and walked away. 

 After a couple minutes we came out of the shock of being treated like bad little boys and girls being put on timeout bad we got up and left.  We went to Bar Louie and had a nightcap and some snacks , were treated like customers should and had a nice end to our evening. Leaving a very hefty tip for the excellent service even though the flat bread can't compare to the Bar Cento Pizza."}
{"text":"What doesn't Bar Cento/Bier Market have? You have your quieter-more romantic setting in the front of the resultant, a wide range of house drafts, a pool table, and downstairs- a great dance floor called Speak Easy. You don't even have to bar hop! You have everything in one place. One of the best pizzas I have probably ever had was Bier Market's Sunny Side Pizza. Made with eggs sunny side up and bacon on top. If I could have it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for an entire week, I probably still wouldn't get sick of it. It's probably one of God's many gifts He has blessed this earth with. And I'm glad its right in my own city...most importantly, five minutes from my house. All Hail late night munchies."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  

The pommes frites are the most delicious fries you will ever have!  They are the thick type with some of the potato skin still on them.  They come with four different types of dipping sauces (ketchup and four other delicious concoctions).  The fries come with huge garlic cloves within the fries and pine needles that add an amazing flavor to the entire dish.  They are a must try!

The pizzas are delicious.  They are on a thin crust that is very crunchy.  The main focus is the toppings.  I've had every pizza without meat and they are all flavorful and distinct in their flavors.

The beer menu is extensive considering it is also a part of Bier Markt.  There are so many choices that you are tempted to stay there for hours (which I've done) just to try different beers."}
{"text":"I really love their strange pizzas, like the egg one and the apple one. 

I went there over the holidays with a large group and everyone enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Awesome food great service amazing atmosphere. Chef Adam Is the man! Can not wait to get a burger there again. Totally surprised at how affordable the price is! I will definitly be back."}
{"text":"Aside from the amazing pizza and fries (love the garlic and rosemary, special touch), the best part of our visits has been having Dan as our server! He remembered our name and order from the first time he served us and has made each successive visit a true pleasure. His outgoing and genuine personality are a rare find these days, the pride he has in his jobs and care for the service he provides is truly one of a kind. Will keep us coming back again and again! Go Dan!!!"}
{"text":"Lovely menu, I love the pizza and french fries. Upscale food that isnt weird or trendy."}
{"text":"I'm going to provide the most important detail first: This place is open until 2:30 and actually serves food that whole time! This was an absolute life saver one night after drinking at Great Lakes and feeling in desperate need of some food.  

The food itself is pretty great. A little pricey, I think, but never disappoints. The pizzas are really unique and delicious, as are the fries. They might be the most delicious fries ever! I haven't branched out much from the pizza because I've always liked it but there are a lot of other tasty sounding options, too! 

This space is huge - I'm not totally sure where Bar Centro ends and Beir Market begins but there is a whole downtairs area in addition to the huge space when you first walk in. I really like the layout and decor, as well. 

The only slightly bad part has been the service, and that wasn't terrible. When we came later at night, we had problems getting simple things like water refills, which tends to irritate me. I'm sure the staff just wanted to go home but hey, you work at a bar so you have to expect to still have customers while you're open! 

Overall, though, great food and a good option for late night snacks  in Ohio City!"}
{"text":"ok. it's been a while. we reluctantly returned to bar cento this past weekend because friends wanted to go, so we agreed. this was our second choice as originally we planned to go to market garden but a previous visit for a quick beer a few nights earlier revealed it to be full of... i don't know what you call this clientele, but it was a weird scene... anyway... so the bottom line is that three years later, NOTHING has changed. except for the fact that now there is valet service. (ha! good enough reason to blackball w25th altogether). the pizza continues to taste like cardboard. the service is appalling. we had the vegetarian entree w/ ohio city pasta, chili oil, carrots, and rainbow chard from the botanical garden. the dish was tasty but tiny. a little on the oily side and light on chard (supposedly the star of the dish). the only saving graces for this place are the fries and the beer list, and frankly, i can drink good beer at home for 1/4 the cost."}
{"text":"I love this place.  
My favorite meal- house red with some fries (actually pomme frits or something similar to that) and the occasional pizza or olive app. 
I was very disappointed that one reviewer called the fries soggy.  Never in the dozen of times I've ordered them have I gotten a soggy batch.  And believe me, I'm a picky fry eater.  I mean who doesn't love those fried bundle of joys cooked with a bunch of rosemary and garlic.  Nothing beats it for me. 
The one downfall of this place is that it's right next to Beir Market.  That place just gets so loud and crowed now a days that it really bothers me."}
{"text":"Bar Cento is decent, but I recently ordered the eggplant fries and they were pretty much inedible... and I love eggplant. The breading tasted nasty and they were over salted. 

I have had their burgers and pizza in the past, which were pretty good."}
{"text":"Good fries, mediocre pies (yay, I'm witty).  The fries were quite good, and the garlic mayonnaise was fantastic with them.  The other mayo flavors (curry and chili) were also good, but the garlic mayo was by far the best.  We got two pizzas - sunnyside pizza (with pancetta, eggs, and black pepper) and their roasted mushroom pizza (I don't remember exactly what was on it).  Neither pizza was that great.  The sunnyside pizza was actually quite flavorless and bland.  The mushroom pizza had a bit more flavor, but really wasn't anything special.

I'd definitely come back here to snack on some fries with garlic mayo, but that's about all I'd want to get."}
{"text":"With a sultry ambiance and a killer menu, Bar Center had a lot of potential. It has lots of room for large parties and tables for two, alike. There are extremely large tables that have a wrap around curtain for VIP privacy as well - almost like a private room! 

Reservations are recommended but our party of 5 walked in at 6:30 and was seated immediately. Happy hour was till 7 so we capitalized on that ordering the White pizza and mussels in addition to wine and beer specials. Alas, the lack of mussels broke my heart, but we ordered the shareable plate of fries ($13 compared to the single serving $5). For main plates burgers, veggie burgers, and Brussel sprouts were ordered. 

All the food seemed very salty- fries are expected, Pizza slightly too much oil and salt, burgers must have been rolled in salt!  

Additionally, after our food was cleared our waitress did not return for about 40 minutes... totally bizarre. The place wasn't packed, but maybe she was the only one waiting tables? Who knows. 

I'd return if they laid off the salt :)"}
{"text":"Quite sincerely the best fries in the city. I say this with no reservation whatsoever. The pizza is also stellar. I've quite honestly never had a bad experience here. knowledgeable wait staff, quiet seating, and amazing brew selections. It's a winner all the way around."}
{"text":"Bar Cento and Bier Markt are the same restaurant, but different bars on opposite sides of a wall. I came here most recently in celebration of Small Business Saturday. My uncle and I both ordered the same entree, the pappardelle, which had rabbit, celeriac, turnip maybe, apples, and olive oil and garlic in lieu of a sauce or broth. I think I really tasted the apple flavor throughout the dish. I liked it though. I ordered it with a side of frites since it came with a side. The frites are fried in duck fat, which makes them quite good. The frites have garlic cloves and rosemary. My uncle told me his white wine was very good. We both enjoyed our lunch. The pappardelle was $20."}
{"text":"Went in for a late snack/dinner with some friends after being recommended by another place whose kitchen was closed (after 10 PM) and was not disappointed! Loved the egg-covered pizza and apps!"}
{"text":"I am so excited that I finally had the opportunity to try Bar Cento.  It was pretty much everything I hoped it would be.

The ambiance in the entry area of Bar Cento/Bier Markt is really nice.  It's romantic and trendy without being obnoxious.  If you're luck enough to get a table in this area, it's quiet and intimate.  If you're seating inside of Bar Cento itself, it's still cute but noisier and more hectic.  It doesn't take away from the dining experience at all, but if you want to have a quiet dinner, request a table in the front.

Our waiter was quite attentive, even though he was obviously quite busy.  It took us a while to decide what we wanted, but he was patient and helpful.

For drinks, I ordered the Moscato, which made me want to give Bar Cento 5 stars at first sip.  Best wine I have ever had, period.  I love sweet, fruity whites, but ti's sometimes hard to find one that's real and not just crap loaded with sugar.  I was quite impressed.  My boyfriend sampled a couple of the beers and loved one but didn't like the other.  Both the beer and wine selections are pretty extensive, so you should be able to find something you like.

The food.  Oh, the food.

I began with the house salad which was oh-so-simple and oh-so-delicious.  Fresh mixed greens plus Parmesan cheese plus house vinegar apparently equal magic.  Great start to the meal.  My boyfriend started with the Belgian Frites with dipping sauces.  The fries are seasoned with rosemary, which I love on potatoes, and served with 4 dipping sauces (we had ketchup, garlic,  chili, and curry).  My boyfriend loved the sauces but they didn't overly impress me- I preferred the fries solo.  After a while though, the rosemary became a bit overwhelming.

For main courses, my boyfriend ordered the Squid Ink Spaghetti and I had the Potato Pizza.  I give the spaghetti 5 stars, hands down.  Perfect portion size and even more perfect taste.  The only flaw I could find was that there was a tad too much oil (this place is really oil happy...just watch them prepare the dishes).  The flavors in the spaghetti were complex with a bit of heat and a tiny bit of sweetness.  The calamari were cooked to perfection- not at all rubbery.  As a side he ordered the Saffron Risotto.  He gave it a 5, I gave it a 3.  For me, I think the texture bothered me more than anything.  I'm picky with food textures.  The flavor was pleasant.

The potato pizza was good.  I ordered it because it's different than what you typically find...basically the only familiar component is the thin crust.  In addition to potatoes, this pizza had prosciutto and Provolone instead of mozzarella. And rosemary.  Lots and lots of rosemary.  Like I said before, I love rosemary, but it's also very easy to overuse it...and I felt like they were too heavy-handed with my pizza.  I didn't taste provolone.  I didn't taste prosciutto.  I didn't taste potato.  All I tasted was rosemary and salt.  It wasn't bad, but I wish it was more balanced.  Perhaps if they only seasoned the potatoes with rosemary instead of the whole pie, it would have worked better.  However, I should say that my boyfriend didn't agree with me.  He said he could taste everything.  Perhaps my tastebuds are discerning enough.

For dessert we ordered the Jeni's ice cream sampler.  I've never had Jeni's before but I've heard nothing but rave reviews.  Those reviews are accurate.  Our sampler included 4 flavors: dark chocolate peppermint, pistachio, black coffee, and brown butter almond brittle.  All delicious.  So much better than regular ice cream.  Itty bitty portions, though (about a tablespoon of each) for $9.  My boyfriend's favorite was the dark chocolate peppermint and mine was the brown butter almond brittle.  But really, they were all good.

With 4 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 meals, and 1 dessert our bill was nearly $80.  That hurt our wallet, but satisfied our stomachs well.  It's definitely possible to spend $30 for two here so long as you have self control.

I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"It was the night before Christmas Eve and I was starving.  I ended up going on a date after Christmas shopping to Bier Market and Bar Cento.  I was slightly disappointed with Bier Markets selection (as they didn't have the beer I was looking for- Old Man's Winter Ale) However, Bar Cento's selection of Indigo Winter Ale was pretty good and slightly sweet.

I am even more amazing that it's relatively gourmet food that's served until 2am.  I had the delicious rosemary garlic fries :) with a small salad.  It was soo good.  However, nothing beats Lola's rosemary garlic fries.  The salad was ok too with the right amount of dressing and cheese.  However, it was slightly plain with nothing but cheese and dressing.  The margarita pizza was pretty good with a winter ale too. It was a good meshing. 

It gets 4 stars because of its great late night accessibility and relatively delicious food available.  However, the salad and the beer selection is nothing amazing.  I think I need to go back when the regular entrees are available during dinner hours"}
{"text":"Went here for their happy hour, which was pretty decent. Ordered a duvel with my veggie burger, and a bianco pizza to split with a friend. The veggie burger was delicious, and perfectly sized. The pizza was nothing special. The bottom was a little burnt, and the top a bit greasy. I've heard about the excellent fries, but alas couldn't have them because they were friend in duck fat :("}
{"text":"Still dreaming of that french fry cornucopia (see pictures for massive order of fries!) we all started with fries, shared an order for 4-5 of us. They come with 3 sauces, one was garlicy, one red peppery, and one curry?! I remember the curry for sure and you should all try it, because it's real good! We shared the marinara pizza with sausage, they have thin crust pizzas, you can pick them up or go at t with a fork and knife. We shared 1 for 4 and did fine with two sides. 
Brussels and the cauliflower. Both were really good and enough to share (if you're not really hungry). The cauliflower had pine nuts and golden raisins so I was a fan of this! The Brussels were great, kind of the standard trendy Brussels, but they were made right and great as well! 

We went with a large group and sat by the bar, our server was great with checks and splitting everything so that was super nice!
The ambiance is trendy/dressy, it's dimly lit for an intimate feel. 

Cool place! We all enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Bar Cento has been the go to place for my wife and I since it opened with Jonathan Sawyer as the chef.
We love the comfortable ambiance (though I can understand if some think the music is too loud), the wait staff that's always engaging in conversation but not so much as to be overbearing and, most importantly the food.
I would say Bar Cento has the best food of any Cleveland-area restaurant in the \"$$\" category and it's menu is also the most varied. Sometimes we are in the mood for one of their numerous thin-crust pizzas ($10 to $17) or the beef burger ($13) with their fries that are cooked in duck fat. Other times we are in the mood for more sophisticated knife-and-fork food, in which case they have an ever-changing selection of pastas (usually $15-$20) or other proteins with the steak frites ($28) being the pinnacle.
Appetizers also have as many options, ranging from Lamb Meatballs or Arrincini if you want to do an Italian theme or meat and cheese boards as well as mussels if you want to do the Gastropub angle.
Their drink offerings are also as varied with a huge beer list coming from their (Siamese) sister restaurant Bier Market, in which they also share food options as well as some dining space. Then there's the multiple wine options (when the restaurant first opened it boasted 100 wine selections -- \"Cento\" means 100 in Italian -- but it doesn't seem like there's that many options now, not that I've counted). In addition to all that, there's a fully stocked bar with some unique mixed drink concoctions.
With all those options, most would forgive the restaurant's paltry dessert menu which rarely have more than 2 or 3 dessert selections."}
{"text":"Worst night ever at bar cento. The bartender, josh, was so disrespectful and the other bartender wouldn't serve us food. Never going back again!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. My friend ordered a caprese salad. After an hour or waiting, our server told us that they were out of tomatoes and could not make the salad. Oh, and they were also out of jam and strawberries, so they could not make the cocktails my friends wanted. After an hour of watching other people receive their orders, we received our \"food.\" My pizza was burnt to black, had olives instead of sundried tomatoes, and tasted like the kitchen had dumped an entire bottle of oregano over the charred crust of what they claimed was a pizza. My friend's risotto was completely flavorless. The kitchen blamed our server and our server blamed the kitchen. After inexplicably making us pay for some of the things we ordered while comping our french fries, our server said \"sorry we failed so hard tonight, guys.\" Yup, Christopher. Ya did."}
{"text":"The manager comped 100% of the bill for us after a rough dining experience. Any other scenario would lead to a 1 star rating. Food took a very long time.. From first entree down to the last, there was a 15 MINUTE gap! Oddly enough, the first dishes out were cold, one of those being a filet. Mr/Mrs manager... You should've come by our table in person! This was a restaurant blunder and nobody but our poor server apologized. I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but man was this a mess. I probably wouldn't be so upset but I had a lot of family in from out of town."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Cleveland however today while the service was great the meal was timed poorly and parts of it over cooked while also serving cold pomme frites. 

Numerous different dishes were tried at the table - the penne, mussels and mushroom risotto were delish - the burger and its bun WAY WAY over cooked & crispy...the peas came out way undercooked...

This place is still one of my favorites though so I will try it again...because it is that good."}
{"text":"The service was superb for a bottle bar bistro. The mussels in white wine were good, the garlic mushroom pizza was great (especially with kalamata olives on it). Tasty beer and fun outdoor people watching location."}
{"text":"Three words: late. night. pizza. 

Their pizzas are pretty great any time of day, actually. But knowing I can grab a delicious pie for some late night drunk munchies, that makes even better. I mean, where else can I get pizza this good at 2am?

Bar Cento and Bier Markt have a weird restaurant set up going on, both sides offer the same menu, but they have different decor...I don't know what the deal is. But we prefer to hang out on the Bar Cento side. Its a little bit \"fancier\" in terms of atmosphere and its usually less crowded, especially at the bar.

Although the menu is pretty large and offers a great number of apps and entrees, the real showstoppers are the pizzas. My favorite is the spicy chicken. Served on crispy, cracker-like crust, topped with spicy chicken sausage and a drizzle of honey. Perfect. 

I'd also recommend getting an order of pomme frites to split. They are some of the best french fries I've had in Cleveland...maybe THE BEST. They fry them up nice and crispy with rosemary sprigs and whole cloves of garlic. They serve 'em up in a big cone with 4 dipping sauces. The roasted garlic aioli is to die for. 

I seriously can't write anymore, its just making me too hungry. Those frites. That pizza. (insert 10 heart eye emojis here)"}
{"text":"Tried the \"Mushroom\" - mushroom, mozzarella, thyme, pancetta. I really liked this one! Delicious.

Tried the \"Sunnyside\" too - pancetta, provoline, pepper, and sunnyside up eggs. I thought this was ok - concept is good but the seasoning was a little off. I wonder what it would taste like with some sriracha sauce...

We came with a fairly large party (bigger than expected) and we ran into some seating snafus. They gave us a complimentary plate (meats, cheeses) which I thought was appropriate, and very gracious. Good service from the many Cleveland hipsters that are around now! Haha.

We also got a nice dessert on the house. I can't remember what it was, but props. Props."}
{"text":"My friend assured our table that Bar Cento is \"known for their fries.\" She's not always right, but I'll give her this one. They were damn good.

We also ordered an assortment of their thoughtfully created pizzas. The Green, Sunnyside, and Seaside were all winners. They also serve more classic pizzas, such as Margherita and Puttanesca.

Bar Cento's pricing is extremely reasonable -- both for food and wine. Pizza's run between $8-10. House bottles of wine, still very good, were only $15."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time here. This was our first meal in Cleveland. 

Our waitress was friendly and the food was served promptly. The place was busy and happening for a Friday night. I was happy that the place was opened late. 

We had the steamed mussels in the smoked tomato romesco with fries. The mussels were cooked perfectly. The smokiness of the tomato sauce added a nice flavour element to the mussels. I also enjoyed the thickness of the fries. 

Since this is attached to the bier market they have a good selection of different types of beers. 

I loved the pizza! After reading reviews about the amazing pizzas we decided on the sunnyside pizza. This was served with provolone, panchetta, and of course egg. The crust was thin and crunchy. I liked how the salty panchetta was balanced by the egg. 

I would love to come back and try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Oh wow.  Margarita pizza heaven.  The crispy cracker crust was perfection. Just the right amount of cheese and basil.  Good thing I don't live here, cause I'd have to eat here often and I'd gain too much weight.  Can't compare to the pizzas I had in NY because this pizza is too different than those."}
{"text":"Usually really good. Not tonight--waited over an hour and entrees never came.  Manager could care less when approached."}
{"text":"My family and I intended to go to Bier Markt, but when we got seated and ordered, we realized that we were in Bar Cento. Oops. But it was a happy mistake because I ended up really enjoying my dining experience here! 

For starters, we got the steamed mussels. The mussels can  be steamed over Belgium beer or white wine. We chose the Belgium beer, per the server's recommendation. Flavor is lightly salty and buttery. Mm mm good! I also loved the bread crisps that came with it :) For entrees, we ordered the spicy chicken and sunnyside pizzas with a side of pomme frites. The spicy chicken pizza was more sweet than spicy! But I much prefer it this way! The honey drizzles made this pizza extremely savory. As for the sunnyside pizza, it was like a breakfast on a pizza. There were strips of bacon and sunnyside up eggs on the pizza. If you're into breakfast items, then give this a try! Both pizzas were thin crust and cooked just perfectly crispy! The pomme frites were a great addition to the pizzas. 

Bar Cento was a great accidental find, and I'll definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Thoughtfully sourced and prepared food and great wine at bargain prices in a comfortable neighborhood- Ohio City's Osteria/Trattoria.

Chef Michael Nowak is one of Cleveland's best chefs and his sous chef Adam is awesome too . Their creativity always pays off vs. an idea sounding interesting but not actually making a good dish. 

The menu is great in that it has standbys like the burger, pizzas, mussels, frites, cheese and meat boards but also has new dishes each week. I've never had a special from that kitchen that didn't make me smile. 

Service is friendly and helpful. Servers get to know you quickly so Bar Cento really does feel like a neighborhood Osteria."}
{"text":"Monday Night Miracle Meal!

OK, on Mondays they run their Happy Hour menu all night, so go belly up to the bar, which was easy to do, and fill up! Be sure to get their delicious white pizza for $5, and I strongly recommend their delicious beer-steamed mussels for $6, or jump to their regular menu for kick-ass meatballs for $9. The pizza is crispy and full of garlicky flavor, the mussels are moist, fresh, and fall off the shell, and the bartenders are attentive and smart, and can offer beer or wine pairings or just mix up a classic cocktail. (My Old Fashioned with call booze was only $7 ... yum!)

You CAN spend a lot here, and I hope to get back for the \"Big Board\" of daily-chosen meats, pates, and cheeses, but if you want great food at an even greater price point, Monday Night is IT!!!

(Oh, and Mitchell's Ice Cream is across the street if you have ANY room left for dessert!)"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere here and the food was decent. The service was terrible. I understand it was a Saturday night but, we saw our waitress once and that was when she brought the menus over. It got to the point where we had 2 tabs open..one at the bar because we had no luck on getting another round of drinks from the wait staff. Once we were done with our food we waited and waited still couldnt find our waitress. We ended up just going to the bar and asking someone else to close out for us. She did finally come around and apologize for being absent but little too late for that lady!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. Stopped here for a late dinner with a group of four, and waited over an hour for our food. The place wasn't busy, and we were finally given the explanation of there being just one person in the kitchen after waiting, ignored, for an hour. When the food finally graced us with its presence, it was in the form of a charred, inedible pizza and an utterly tasteless risotto. One member of our party ordered the Caprese salad and was informed only when the other food was delivered that the kitchen was out of tomatoes. After waiting OVER AN HOUR for the food with no apology whatsoever, to be informed that the salad was unable to be made is unacceptable. Our server, Christopher, was inattentive and smarmy. He blamed the kitchen for the delay and the kitchen blamed him. There was a bug in my wine and I was shorted change back upon payment. His parting words as we left, \"Sorry we failed so hard tonight.\" Sorry we wasted our evening and our money, and ended up at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"came here late night for some grub and drinks with friends. must get the fries. they are to die for. wanted to try the mussels but they sold out. pizza was ok. beer from next door. lots of selection. good ambiance. will be back."}
{"text":"The sunnyside pizza was good but a little too peppery in my opinion. The pepper is a great idea but mine was overdone. The frites were really great, especially with the rosemary eaten along with a fry. I do wish they had some different dipping sauces. The different aiolis are pretty good but I wish there was something other than ketchup that didn't make me feel it going straight to my hips.Our waiter was really really bad at keeping our drinks filled. He walked past us 7-8 times in a row with all of our drinks completely empty. The beers here are really expensive."}
{"text":"I've had several people tell me this place has some of the best pizza in Cleveland and as a personal pizza lover, I have to disagree with all of them. Maybe the timing wasn't right, maybe I'm ordering the wrong kind, but the last two times I came here I was very unimpressed. The last pizza I ordered was the potato pizza and I honestly ate two slices to be polite to my date as I really did not like even the first bite. The rosemary was totally overpowering and the potatoes didn't taste cooked all the way through. I'm not a fan of the crust or lack of sauce. It's more like a flatbread. Just a little misleading. 

Their wine & beer selection was pretty good and their service was awesome. The third times the charm so I'll be giving this place another try just probably not for their pizza."}
{"text":"Underrated. Skip Crop and come here! I havent been here since 2009, and boy has this restaurant grown. I ordered the Wild Boar Ravioli in Rabbit Mouse, and tbh didnt expect it to be even as good as Touch, but this blew me away. I ordered a second plate- partly because it was kind of a small portion- and gave my compliments to the chef personally. If you're on w. 25 looking for great grub at something classier than your typical gastropub, this is the place. Great date spot, and good on the weekends too."}
{"text":"While many establishments simply fail to meet the expectations of diners who want quality without compromise, Bar Cento delivers without hesitation! The primary specialty here is the rustic pizza - which is baked to perfection the way it was meant to be - old world style in a brick oven.  The pies are beautifully crafted with a crisp crust and a slight char, but with massive taste that is captured by the freshness of the ingredients.  The interior is rather spacious, with booths located along the walls in the front section and small tables in the back near the bar - which seats 16 people and is made from an old Amish barn.  One of the enduring qualities of Bar Cento is their utilization of locally sourced ingredients, which are featured in all of their dishes.  Lastly, the fact that you can sit down and order such exceptional food up until 2:00 a.m 365 days a year only further illustrates the significance of this awesome place!"}
{"text":"The time has come. Today. I wish there was a half star. This shit is getting serious. 

Alright, Bar Cento. I'm about to lay it all out for you. Plainly. 

If it wasn't for your food (and beer) you'd be getting 2 stars. Yep. That's right. TWO stars. Maybe, just MAYBE ..... 2.5 stars. 

Why? Because your servers are .... to be quite frank.... bitchy. And unapologetic. And they don't listen. And they try to push you aside and ignore you when you ask for a beer in the nicest way possible. And look you directly in the eye and say, \"I gotta go!\" and make those arm/hand gestures that suggest you move-out-of-their-way-right-now. And, well, I'm sure there are other things I could mention but I was a little loopy from previous cocktails at a finer establishment so -- I don't remember every downfall of last nights experience. 

All complaints and whining aside, the pizza and pomme frites are to die for. The beer list is beautiful. The ambiance is stellar. I love sitting in a booth with pillows. Like, seriously love it. 

Wait --- back to the pizza. I need to talk about it some more. I ordered the Sunnyside. Hellz yeah! It was good. Really frickin' good. Maybe even amongst the best in Cleveland. Like maybe even top 3. 

Oh yeah, and those pomme frites? Wayyyyyy good. Best ever maybe. 

So, Bar Cento? Are you listening? Hire some nicer, more attentive servers or something. Huh? And then I'll come back and give you some more stars. K? Thanks."}
{"text":"Extremely yummy flat-bread pizzas. Wonderful selection of wine behind the bar as well as an enormous beer selection shared with neighboring BierMarkt. 

I was here on a few occasions with friends. We had a great time drinking and eating at the bar. Cento has a chill yet classy atmosphere. Bartenders are fun and full of good tips for choosing food and drinks."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! Skip Lava Lounge and go right to Bar Cento!!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and always enjoyed it, but never really loved it.  But lately, it is becoming a big \"go-to\" for me in Ohio City.  It has the perfect environment for dinner before a night out on 25th.  It can be casual if you go during the week or on a  Sunday, or if you go on a Friday or Saturday night it's a little more upscale but still with the fun environment. 

You can never go wrong with a drink their, I've ordered wine and of course I've ordered their home brewed beer and I've loved it all.  Usually the waiters are very helpful in recommending a beer that you would enjoy - and if you don't have always taken it back and given me or a friend a new one.  With it recently being Christmas I was a regular of their fesitvus.  

Now onto their food. The Pomme Frittes DELICIOUS! The dipping sauces that they come with are perfect to accent the taste! Their pizza's are really good too - thin crust brick oven cooked!.  I prefer one of their specialty pizzas compared to their basic cheese or pepperoni - I am not the biggest fan of their tomato sauce.  The sunnyside pizza is delicious - but you have to like eggs, and their arugula pizza is my favorite! Even if you are splitting an appetizer or ordering their house salad - which is really good - I would still suggest you order your own pizza.  I've split numerous times before and if you are hungry it isn't completely enough - but if its before a night out you can easily split a pizza.  I believe there are six slices in a pizza.  

They also make home made pasta in house which I have only had once but would like to try again.  It was definitely homemade and cooked to perfection - and that is coming from an Italian."}
{"text":"The venue is great BUT they take forever! We waited 1.5 hours for a couple burgers and a pizza when the place was more than half empty. Our server was very friendly but she didn't come around often. If you have all the time in the world to hang out, this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is amazing. It's thin crust and they have a variety of different topping. The server was awesome and provided good recommendations for drinks. Loved the food and atmosphere. Great selection of beer samplers and wine. Cute place for date night"}
{"text":"We had made reservations at 7 with on table. We arrived about 1/2 hr early and were told they didn't have the reservation. But we we're told that she could fit us in around 30-40 minutes. We went to the adjoining bar and had a few drinks. At 45 minutes, we asked how much longer. She said didn't have anything for 1.5 hours. We asked why she didn't call or get us and she said she was too busy. No respect. There are many better restaurants in the area than to go to a place that doesn't care for their patrons."}
{"text":"After reviewing their menu and everything sounded great we decided to give them a try. The restaurant is nice, they have a full dining room in the front and two separate bars in the back. We were seated promptly and our server greeted us quickly. Now for the experience was up for debate. Granted it was the first day for our server so she really didn't know the menu and the kitchen did a pour job on the execution of our dishes.  

So here goes: 
For appetizers we ordered their house made giardiniera. It was fantastic our only complaint is that it was a little heavy on the clove flavor. Next we tried the mushroom ragu & polenta (local mushrooms, pomodoro, creamy mascarpone polenta and white truffle oil).  This was a great vegetarian dish, the mushrooms were very meaty and the ragu and polenta had fantastic flavor. Also tried the lamb meatballs. (ricotta, arugula, basil and tomato vinegarette). The meatballs were nice and tender and good flavor and flavorful sauce. For our final app we tried their arancini (shrimp, saffron rissoto, pancetta and black garlic aioli). The filling had a wonderful flavor combo and nice chunks of shrimp, the only downside was they were a little greasy. 

For our main courses we tried the grilled Caesar salad. Not a winner! First of all it was not grilled and second, the lettuce was brown and wilted. They ended up taking it off the bill.  Next was the castolette (short rib, mushroom ragu, polenta, braised kale and lemon gremolata). Great dish very similar to the app option only this has the added short rib which was very tender and flavorfull. Also tried their egg yolk & pancetta frascatelli (Italian speatzle, pancetta, poached egg yolk, black pepper and pecorino romano). In my opinion this dish was a disaster it was very dry and flavorless. And we also tried their Sunnyside Pizza (provolone, pancetta, farm eggs and black pepper). This pizza would have been amazing the only problem was someone must have dropped the pepper shaker on the pizza it was overly covered. That is the only thing you could taste. Now I love black pepper but only as a compliment. 

For our sides we tried the brussel sprouts which were very tasty, the Cavolfiore (cauliflower, golden raisins, sumac and parsley crema). Delicious as well, Zucca (roasted acorn squash, basil pesto, Calabrian chili and Parmigiano regiano). Great flavor combo. And to finish a side of frites (garlic, rosemary and ketchup). The fries had a crispy exterior and a creamy interior. Really good. Overall most of the food was good so for us revisiting it is still up for debate."}
{"text":"this was a highly disappointing experience. the service was horrible, complete with nasty looks from the waitresses. they didn't have the first thing that i ordered then i had to wait half an hour for dessert because the kitchen was too busy cleaning up. here's the kicker, when she finally brought it, they were out of ice cream, which was a huge ingredient in the dish, and it tasted like shit. i will never return and inform all my clients of the nightmare."}
{"text":"We had the best time here! The food was awesome and the service amazing. I feel bad that I've already forgotten our waiter's name, but he was so knowledgeable and yet not snobby about the wine/beer selections. (Full disclosure: he asked me what I liked and I said fruity, sweet, girly and he didn't laugh at me at all and just suggested this awesome raspberry drink stuff. Yum!) We felt taken care of but not rushed, which is definitely what I look for on vacation. :)
Pizza was amazing, pommes frites amazing, churros with chocolate yummy. Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bar Cento is worth the sometimes crazy Ohio City parking.  The pizzas are supper yummy... as is the rest of the menu!  I have have been known to eat half a pizza and take half home to finish devouring it.   An extensive wine list consists of 100 wines.  Not into wine... the bartender will grab you a pint from the attached establishment Bier Market.  The staff is friendly and fun... Chef, Jonathon Sawyer is a always around and willing to chat.  

I have also been here for the kids 'make your own' pizza night.  It is a great time for cheffin' it up with the lil ones... and the peanut butter cookie with jelly ice cream sammies afterwards are a scrumptious treat."}
{"text":"YUM! YES!! A friend recommended Bar Cento for dinner while I'm in Cleveland on business.
Staff was exceptional (wish I remembered the name of the helpful and friendly blonde server in the front room?), the fries were recommended as a 'can't miss' and we're SO GOOD!! And I was already full on my uber-healthy starter  but the spicy chicken pizza was so good I couldn't put it down!! House red wine was light and fruity (better than the much more expensive glass of cab I had) and the happy hour specials totally reasonable for splurging!
Go to Bar Cento NOW!!"}
{"text":"Our party of 6 ate dinner here last Monday night right prior to going to the Cavs game.  The restaurant was pretty much empty at 6PM and the waitress wanted to seat us in the back of the restaurant.  I asked for the front booth, got a rolling eye response, but was finally seated up front.  One of our party ordered the \"Board\".  It came with a board filled with \"whatever\".  No explanation on what was being served, so it was a \"guessing game\" for everyone as to what we were eating.  Not good for a $25 appetizer.  Another ordered the ravioli.  To say it was served al dente was a far stretch.  The dough was almost \"raw\", being chewing and gummy.  Due to the short time we could be there, we did not complain as that would have taken too long to resolve on the spot.  This place has a long way to go to be acceptable as a place to eat before the Cavs or any other sport event.  Too many close-by restaurants to choose from that are a much better choice."}
{"text":"My date and I were very excited for their \"made in house pasta.\" We ordered the short rib tortellini per the server's recommendation and were extremely disappointed. The \"homemade\" pasta was tough and had the texture of frozen pasta that was thawed out.

Luckily their pizza was delicious as well as their cauliflower side!

I'll stick to the pizza and wine next time I'm here"}
{"text":"This particular night out was our first snow of any significance in the city, and we knew we were wanting to stay close, so we decided to head to Bar Cento in Ohio City for wine and hand tossed pizzas.

I knew the wine list was good, and thin crust gourmet pizza just sounded yummy.

It was probably 6:30pm when we arrived and there were only a handful of people in the front room or in Bar Cento itself. The server was prompt and helpful - even if she did talk to my partner about the wine selections as if I wasn't sitting there. Bless her heart.

Our wine selection was Steltzner Claret Bordeaux '08, at $35.  A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc - its a pretty big wine, with well balanced tannins. Nice cherry, cinnamon and clove on the palate. Its spent 22 months in Mixed French Oak, so this is oakier than I usually like. But with our Big Board - charcuterie, cheeses and house pickled vegetables for $18, it was an excellent balance. We loved the 2 different patés on the board and the cheeses were very well selected. Nothing commonplace.

I was impressed with the upper end of their wine list. Their higher end wines are less than 2x retail. For restaurant service, and comparable to some places in town... I was impressed. The lower end isn't quite the deal on pricing, but nothing was in my \"are you kidding me?\" range.

Chef Adam Lambert was out and about in the dining room. One of the things that really stood out was that Chef was outside the kitchen talking to the servers and taking one last look at each plate that went out. It was obvious that quality and presentation were his highest priorities.

The pizzas were ordered and arrived just as we finished the Big Board. We got the Bianco with sausage and the Olive. The man can put away some pizza, but with the two good size pizzas and the Big Board, we had about half of each to take home for lunch. Both were delicious. I'm a WineOH who is always looking at ingredients because I have an MSG allergy. Anyone sharing this sensitivity will be happy to know that Bar Cento is 100% MSG free, including the sausage. (always a concern)

Final Comments: Nice wine list, great service, food served with the highest quality in mind.

We'll go back. And if you are looking for a nice meal with your honey, it makes the grade."}
{"text":"MMM really great french fries European style, with mayo, ketchup, and mustard! Good place to go during Happy Hour cheap pizza, but not my favorite place to hang out for the whole night, a bit expensive for me!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go when I am craving a yummy pizza and am not in the mood for tons of dough. The pizza is so light, airy crust and always fresh toppings. Bar Cento is my go to place for a casual dinner or get together with old friends. 

I have gotten the meat and cheese board, which is great. They have good menu options and I love the lively atmosphere. Great happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"really?  I gotta follow that review about \"a life incomplete\"?  for the love of....  well, while I am not quite the wordsmith that Matthew M. is, I am still going to offer my own simple perspective on one of my favorite places in town  ;o)

Bar Cento has quickly become my cheap(-er than Greenhouse Tavern) place to go to relax, have great food and amazing beer.  When you come here, be prepared to be amazed when you finally hunt down that beer you've been wanting to try for weeks (Dogfish Head's Bitches Brew) or when you find several beers you actually enjoy drinking (even though you don't really like beer all that much, lol).

Their pomme frites are the best I've had since actually being in Belgium!  Done traditional Belgian style and served with four different dipping sauces...I still haven't decided which one I like the best.  Their pizza is solid and I must say that their Antipasti is one of the best in the city for it's price.  The Big Board is the one you want to go for, the samplings of meat and cheese are out of this world.  I've had much, much worse for the same price, a sad little plate filled mainly with something akin to Ritz crackers, but we shall not talk about that tragedy....

Been here several times and even though Bier Markt is right next door, I've always found myself on the Bar Cento side of things.  The bartenders are friendly and obviously love their jobs, especially when they are extolling the virtues of a new brew to their customers.  One day I will make it downstairs to Speakeasy, but for now, I am happy with my Frites et la biere...."}
{"text":"Went here after reading it had the best pizza and we were looking for a light meal. Got here in time for happy hour, lucky! They have great deals on a few of their more popular items - burger, pizza bianco, fries. The others in my group ordered fries - garlicy goodness, and the pizza bianco - more garlicy goodness. I had a hard time deciding between the new to the menu hazelnut farfalle - peaches, pasta, chanterelle mushrooms, and the burger, marinara pizza, etc. It all sounded great. I asked the waiter and he suggested the sunnyside pizza - Provolone, housemade pancetta, blue loon farm eggs, black pepper. He didn't steer me wrong. For not being hungry, I still ate 1/2 - it was much bigger than the pizza banco. I wouldn't travel across the country for it, but if I was going there again, it would be hard not repeating.

The service was very \"relaxed\" and again, if we were local, it would be somewhere we'd go back to happily."}
{"text":"Oh-oh Bar Cento, where did you go-go? Had a very disappointing experience tonight. Was sat immediately (on Black Friday, thankfully) but the meal went downhill quickly. Ordered the fall panzanella salad which was missing the key ingredients of quinoa, ricotta, and kalamata olives. Also ordered a pizza which was supposed to have pesto, green olives, and basil- all missing. When I brought this up to the waitress I was told that green olives \"turn into kalamata olives\" upon cooking them (what?!?!). No pesto but had tomato sauce instead. Staff was defensive when we brought up the oversight. Drinks took 30 minutes to arrive after ordering... not being dramatic. Very, very odd. An off night? Have been here 20+ times over the years, but I'm thinking tonight might have been my last."}
{"text":"We had a blast here, very cool atmosphere with the doors open. Almost everyone got pizza, they were all delicious! Crispy and flavorful, especially the breakfast pizza: oh my, I added basil, do it. Wine flights not worth it to us, small pour for $19. And the ravioli wasn't 5 star considering the ingredients. Kinda bland. Burger was cooked right, and the fries are thick. We will come back here, gonna check out the happy hour! PIZZA!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. We sat right in front of the kitchen window...it was very interesting.  Food was good.  Beer selection was a bit of a miss...first two we ordered they were out of.....and they sit less than a block from the brewery?!?!  Good experience, will go back again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for more than five years. So when we stopped by recently for only a few cocktails, it was not only disappointing but honestly hazardous. The \"high-end\" liquor we selected for drinks was CLEARLY not what was represented. The drinks tasted bad and both of us felt sick soon after (likely due to mold from re-used bottles).

This place used to have great service and solid food. That is not representative of the current state of affairs. Avoid at all costs!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while, but I've heard that Adam is doing great things as head chef, and they did steal away Lola's charcuterie expert.  I stopped in for a snack and a beer.  The beer and charcuterie was great, but the rest of the food kind of sucked.  I'm going to go back in hopes that this was just an off night since I do love this place a lot.

First, service was fine.  No complaints there at all.  The food was the issue.  I ordered the broccoli raab, wild mushroom bisque, pickled pork shoulder, and the charcuterie board.

The wild mushroom bisque was creamy and it had good mushroom flavor, but the soup had formed skin in the bowl.  It seemed odd for it to skin so fast even though it just came out of the pan.  I stirred up the soup and all was well, but I did find it to be slightly over-salted. Not bad enough to complain, but enough to take notice.

The broccoli raab was an absolute mess.  The dish contained about 3 ounces of overcooked broccoli raab soaking in two inches of oil and covered in sea salt.  It was inedible.  The sea salt was overpowering and crunched with each bite.  The veggies were incredibly limp and, of course, greasy.  Broccoli raab, being a bitter veggie, didn't help this concoction.  This was a huge failure by whoever cooked the dish.

The pickled pork shoulder looked great.  The chetnuts, lardo, and greens all made the dish look very inviting.  Everything packed flavor except for the pork.  It was flavorless.  To go from over-salted food to flavorless meat was quite surprising.  The texture over the entire dish felt like well-dressed lunch meat, but with even less flavor in the meat than I would get from the deli.  I'm not sure of the process for how the shoulder was cooked and pickled, but someone forgot a step along the way, I'm sure of it.  If not, this recipe needs some major work.

The charcuterie board was the standout.  I miss the some aspects of the old board that would have contained proscutto and other salumi items.  This board seemed a bit more french in nature.  But that's a nit pick complaint because the board was amazing.  But that's to be expected since it's essentially Lola's old board--it's made by the same guy.  

I think what bugged me the most was watching the kitchen do its thing.  In the past, when I had a good food experience, the kitchen always seemed to be operating with some discipline and skill.   In this visit, I saw the line eagerly working to close up shop even though the kitchen was to be open for four more hours.  Everyone was goofing off and playing on their cell phones.  My food shouldn't be drowning in oil and salt if there's time to play around.  It also struck me as odd to see a large bag of commercial peeled garlic.  That never used to be an option for Cento, and rightfully so since there's a huge difference between fresh garlic and something peeled in a factory.  Garlic is the most used ingredient int hat place as far as I know.  While easier to use, changing the garlic to something packing less power is troublesome.  That small change tells me things might not be moving in the right direction overall.  The cured meat department is certainly going good, and I'm sure the pizza is still awesome, but everything else may be in need of some revision.  I'll pop back in for a full dinner soon enough since the current menu looks great--it's the type of menu I want to see.  I hope I just hit an off night and everything on that menu strikes the right balance of flavor that I didn't get this time around."}
{"text":"One of the sets of parents was in town this weekend, and we wanted to do something touristy, so we visited West Side Market.  We figured we'd get lunch while we were in the area.  Our original plan of one of the breweries was vetoed due to noise, but luckily my husband remembered having liked the steak frites at Bier Mrkt on a business trip last year, so we ended up in its next door neighbor, Bar Centro.

The ambiance is modern, classy, and importantly for this visit, not loud.  Their beer menu is impressive-- both a lot of local brews on tap and some more traditional options in bottles.  The wine and mixed drink menus looked great as well.  Prices are reasonable; twelve-inch pizzas range from $8-$15 (could be single serving, or shared if you order a side dish) and most entrees were in the $20-$29 range.  

Everyone seemed to enjoy their food options.  We had:
--house salad: nothing out of the ordinary, but a great vinaigrette and nice fresh greens.
--pickles: I don't like pickles, but this mini platter had a variety of pickled vegetables, all brined with different spices, and my husband said it was good.
--spicy chicken pizza: if you have a good heat tolerance, calling this spicy is a stretch, but we really enjoyed it.  The chicken sausage had great flavor and the crust was delicious.
--marinara pizza with pepperoni: I didn't taste this one but apparently it was great.
--mussels and frites:  he didn't seem crazy about the mussels, but they looked good to me, and the fries were fantastic.

There's so many restaurants in the Ohio City neighborhood I want to try, but I'd definitely consider making a repeat visit if I find myself in the area."}
{"text":"The pomme frittes were very good (even though I found out they are just fries fried in duck fat). I also split the sunnyside pizza with the Husband, it was very good, the seasoning is great and the egg is cooked perfect.

The Belgium beer selection is incredible.
I had 6 beers and every single one of them was great."}
{"text":"Great Ohio City stop! We had the beer sampler which was perfect for 2 people. We also tried the Sunny Side pizza (which was featured on Food Network) it was interesting in a good way. The service was great and the food was good!"}
{"text":"What happened to west 25th street area? its hip, cool, revitalized. I have not been here other than the west side market during the day. I could not be happier to see this growth. The bar was awesome, huge, clean, friendly and packed with people having a great time. I did not eat but the folks who were looked happy."}
{"text":"Bar Cento has a large assortment of upscale pizzas in an upscale, trendy environment. Pizzas were good, but very greasy and not the best I've ever had compared to others with similar ingredients. Take for example, the arugula pizza. The best versions of this pizza don't bake the arugula like they do at Bar Cento, they'll pile it on top for a fresh peppery bite. Service was good, the waitress didn't even mind replacing my beer with one I actually liked. Ambiance was nice, although our long but very thin table was strange and maybe a little uncomfortable. I would have loved to sit in one of the front tables with curtains, but unfortunately you need 6 people to sit there."}
{"text":"A brisk fall evening, I believe the day was Thursday the time somewhere in the neighborhood of 6:30pm. We approached the front of the restaurant and were immediately faced with a decision - one door read Bar Cento, the other Bier Markt. I felt a bit like Neo. Take the red pill or the blue pill. I grabbed the cold handle and swung open the door. A bit dramatic, I know. Besides, both doors lead into the same place. We were immediately greeted by the smiling hostess and lead to a comfy booth along the perimeter of the main lobby. I say lobby because that's exactly what it feels like. Large and open, high ceilings painted white, their original textured tin still evident.

Apparently, Bar Cento is more of the restaurant-y head of this hydra while Bier Markt, as its name implies, is the bar. No need to worry, because when you sit down you get menus for both places.

Our server was wonderful. He was kind, smiled constantly and attended to our every need. Waters were always refilled and he stopped in a few times to check on our progress. Just the right amount of presence. Where the service did fall a scosche flat for me was in the back of the house. Food preparation is a bit, how shall I say, relaxed. As others have mentioned, the pace of the meals here at Bar Cento can be a tad lax. I wouldn't go as far as to say it was painfully slow, just enough to put the initial thoughts of \"Hmm, when do you think our food will arrive?\" into your head right before the server drops it off. Here's where the first half star falls.

The beer list at Bar Cento is minimalist with most of their efforts focused on wine. They have about a half-dozen draught offerings and a gaggle of pricey big bottles. Bier Markt, on the other hand, is for beer geeks. A Belgian beer bar, they have a super strong bottles list (something like a hundred to choose from) and 30 regularly rotating tap handles with everything from Trappist ales to saisons. They even serve the beers in the proper glassware. Now the rub - having this many taps can lead to the inevitable tap out, right? Unfortunately, on the eve of our visit, it was the dry season. One or two beers out? Sure. But six? C'mon, guys, what's up? And the sound of another half star hitting the ground fills the air.

The food was brilliant. There, I said it. This is why I would come back here again, and probably will. A few notes, the happy hour burger special is worth the trip alone, with a normally $12 burger selling for $6 (sans fries, though) and some decent $3.50 beer specials. Now on with the show:

Apple Salad - A wonderful fall seasonal offering. Julienned apple slices, local greens, apple vinaigrette, bleu cheese, and candied walnuts. The acid from the vinaigrette, the sweetness from the walnuts and the funk of the bleu cheese - I love this combination. This one varied from what was listed on the meny\u (no Brussel sprouts here) but what I had was delicious.
 
Mixed Greens Salad - Local greens, green olives, almonds, slices of persimmon, parmesan, and white balsamic. My wife really enjoyed this salad. I had never tasted a persimmon before so it was a unique experience for me. The combination of the salty olives and the sweet fruit worked well and you could taste the freshness of the greens.

Mushroom Pizza - Food Network rated this the best pizza in Ohio? Sure, it was good, really good, but the best? This pie featured a crispy flatbread style crust, charred perfectly, topped with garlic infused oil, grilled leeks, Mahon cheese, coriander and wild mushrooms. I could have eaten this thing by myself. What the hell is Mahon cheese, you ask? It's amazingly wonderful Spanish cow's milk cheese and you need to put it into your mouth now.

Ohio Beef Burger (side of fries added for $4) It had been so long since I had eaten a truly memorable burger I had almost forgotten how good such a simple food could be. The chef nailed the meat temperature at a perfect medium. The meat was juicy, full of flavor and seasoned well. The soft house-made bun was the perfect vehicle and the toppings of sweet grilled onions, Port Salut cheese, mixed greens, and tomato tacit additions. I devoured it and licked every finger along the way. The fries were thick-cut and served with entire cloves of garlic and sprigs of rosemary. Since the garlic was still raw it did very little for the fries. I also found the ketchup a bit pedestrian. A nice garlic aioli or malt vinegar mayo would have made better options.

We had a really good time during our visit. With a few minor exceptions the experience was quite near perfect. There's just something that speaks to the soul when it comes to pairing good beer with simple, well-executed comfort foods and Bar Cento and Bier Markt do it right. I'm not sure if I agree with the two-name concept or the slightly confusing menu crossover, but I do agree with the end result. I'm a fan and I am looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"Highlights: Bar Cento food is delicious. The garlicky pomme frites were cut thick and paired with incredibly creative aoli -- including a curry-flavored one. The pizza, delicious. Corn side dish, excellent. They have a great selection of beers. This is a fun place to hang out.

Things to improve:
I imagine \"confit\" to be tender and crispy on the outside. The chicken confit was not. 

Our wait time for the food was exactly 45 minutes and there was no acknowledgement or apology. Maybe this was an \"off\" day, but it certainly colored our experience."}
{"text":"A few girlfriends and I celebrated Galentine's Day at Bar Cento. The spicy chicken pizza was out of this world delicious and the service was great. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"LOVE the Pomme Frites! I must admit they are pretty much the only thing I go here for. The burger's are also good and my husband and daughter have given rave reviews to the pizza. The beer selection is hard to beat. Food is served till 2am 364 days a year. But the pomme frites are amazing (they are also GLUTEN FREE!)"}
{"text":"The sunny side pizza is awesome! We also ordered the big board which was great. Tons of food and a great variety. The crust and flavor of the pizza was perfect. I ordered some of their house red wine, super acidic and not my favorite. They have a huge beer selection which is great. The prices are kind of high but it's not bad considering the quality of food. 

This place gets hopping at night on the weekend. Our server seemed annoyed with us, as did the bartenders which is my only complaint. The basement is another bar and it gets packed and loud. But good music and a ton of fun. 

The decor inside is comfy and attractive."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Ok food. Cool scene though! I am a huge fan of the Ohio city area and like coming down here at least once a month as I am not that close to Cleveland. We usually come here for light appetizers and a couple beers, and then sometimes for a cocktail. All of which are pretty good. I would say above average on all, but not the best in the area. We have also done several networking and alumni events here and they have all turned out great. The flatbreads are always a hit. I would keep this on in your Ohio Pub crawl for sure!"}
{"text":"Everyone raves about the French fries here (\"you HAVE to have the fries\"), but honestly I didn't think they were anything special. We had 2 orders for the table, and don't get me wrong we finished them, but they tasted like typical steak fries with garlic and salt to me. I also wasn't impressed with the pizzas. We had 4 pizzas for the table (7 people) and it was plenty (we took home at least 1). Plus side: The crust is thin & the pizzas are not greasy Down side: All I really tasted was crust/crunchy bread. Not sure that I would go back for dinner when there are so many other great spots in the area to try."}
{"text":"Pizza... Outstanding.  Service... Terrible.  Tried to be nice and crack a joke with the server but clearly he wasn't having it. Obviously too busy for human emotions. Pizza was brought to us in a timely manner by someone else. In passing our server mumbled something that resembled \"everything good?\" But was gone before we could answer. My husband and I devoured the sunnyside pizza ( we've been craving it for months)  all the while looking for our server. The pancetta is very salty and we needed a refill on our waters.... No server. We finished our pizza, no server. Ready for the check, STILL no server.  After much time and debate my husband and I decided to just leave money for our bill on the table. We had pizza ($14)  and (1) water each so it should be easy...  $20 on the table left under our (1) water glass. That will cover it and include just under 30% for (still no sign of) our server.  On the way out we located the hostess and gave her a polite FYI that we couldn't find our server but left money at the table to cover the bill. God forbid anyone thought we were dining and dashing. I made it 40 years without having to do that, I wasn't going to start now over a $14 pizza.  Just as my husband was about to hand the valet our ticket our server appeared. Right there, flesh and blood on the sidewalk. I almost fainted!  He began apologizing for not checking back.  For a brief second I thought well isn't that nice... Then he hits us with \"you're going to have to pay your bill!\"  Excuse me?!? Well obviously he STILL hadn't been back to our table! I was mortified. Right there in front of a whole street of people, an officer and the valet. He couldn't refill a water, or bring us our check but he could hunt us down on a busy street. Really?? Needless to say I went back in for my change!   Honestly, the pizza isn't THAT good!"}
{"text":"I carefully choose this place as our valentines date night while we were downtown.  I was incredibly disappointed.  We did order the highly rated pomme frites.  They were good,  I think fries served with mayo are always a win.  I did not think they were extra special or the best fries I have ever had.  I was very excited to order the pork sausage/ salsa verde pizza.  I thought perfect all of my favorite things!  When we got the pizza I was super excited it looked so good.  My first bite can only be described as offensive.  I could not put my finger on what ingredient was so off for me I could not eat it.  I was so hungry I even tried to scrap all the toppings off and eat the dough but it was still offensive.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"How disappointing.  After a terrible lunch around the block I came back to Ohio city for dinner.  I was told this was great pizza.  I did not find it that.  The margharita pizza was bland at best and the server does not know fresh mozzarella means.  Good beer selection but would not come back for pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great beer selection. fries fried in duckfat? yes please. Mushrooms in bacon fat? yes please. Staff is friendly, the decor is killer and the owner was super pleasant and approachable. Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on Bar Cento for some time now, and I'm disappointed that I waited so long to finally experience what it had to offer.  Our party of 4 started with a mix of wine and beer flights, which were accompanied by some small food pairings. Our server was very helpful, knowledgeable, and attentive.  

Get the pomme frites. Amazing. The sauces compliment the frites very well, but they're not necessary.  The charcuterie board was also solid, but pales in comparison to the frites. 

The pizzas were recently voted as the \"Best in Ohio.\"  I'm not sure that I'd go that far, but they were very good.  I tried the Sunnyside, which is something that I would not mind for every single breakfast until the end of time.  Others also spoke very highly of the potato and Spicy Chicken Pizzas.  

We opted to go elsewhere for dessert, (it's West 25th. There are tons of options!), but I was very pleased following my trip to Bar Cento.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"Went here with a rather large party last night.  Ordered food that didn't arrive until 1.5 hours later (after bringing the missing food to our server's attention numerous times).  When the food finally arrived, every meal on the table was cold.. Not even slightly warm, but cold and didn't look fresh at all.  Needless to say, we called the manager over.  He was barely apologetic and had a smirk on his face like he was annoyed with us wasting his time.  Not sure what was worst, the kitchen or management's attitude.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Good god, my dinner here this past Friday was life-altering. 

Have you been to Bar Cento recently? If you haven't do yourself the best favor in the world and go there, now. 

Yes, their brick oven pizzas, frites with dipping sauces and big cheese boards are all still divine. But since the chef change, I urge you to order something new off the menu. First of all, most of the ingredients used at Bar Cento are sourced from the Refugee Response Farm, meaning everything is fresh and organic. Plus, by purchasing meals from Bar Cento, you're helping support a great cause! Beyond that, just about everything on said menu is made in-house. From breads, sausages, cured meats and sauces to uniquely prepared items like pawpaw geleé made with a centrifuge (oh freaking cool is that?!) Chef Adam really set the bar high for the new menu and consistently surprises my taste buds with combinations I'd never think to try. 

Recently we tried: 
- The foie terrine and centrifuged pawpaw gelee, served with Appalachian allspice biscotti and drizzled with dark rum caramel. Ohmygod, how did they come up with this flavor combination and why is it so delicious? Trust me, even if you're not a big foie person, you have to give this dish a shot. 

- The brick oven roasted chicken with rabbit involtini, it's mind-blowing. The proscuitto wrapped around the involtini is crispy, salty and compliments the super-moist, flavorful meat inside. 

- The strozzapreti (house made pasta, braised pork, baby zucchini, tomato) was comfort food bliss. The pasta was fresh and still had a hearty bite and the sauce had such a complex depth to its flavor that I couldn't help but devour the entire plate. 

- Two sides dishes I can't help but recommend are the Refugee Response yard beans and the Rittman Orchards sweet corn. Both are orgasmic. 

- Don't forget to finish your meal with a light treat, like the \"coffee and donuts\", which featured house-made donuts so light and airy I didn't feel a pinch of guilt. They were sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and you dip them in an espresso, hot chocolate mixture that made me weak in the knees. 

There also seems to be a vast improvement in their servers, who just seem to care a heck of a lot more! The past few times we've been here, we've had 5-star service even out on the patio. 

Overall, Bar Cento's menu keeps getting better, while still serving up the ol' favorites without missing a beat. I love coming here because I know I'm not going to spend an arm and a leg, but I'm going to get food like I spent a fortune. I can't wait to come back and try more of Chef Adam's genius creations!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers. The Jenis ice cream dessert sampler was pathetic in size for $5.00."}
{"text":"Great food and great booze selection. The staff was friendly and the ambiance is cordial. The downside: we did wait awhile for our food to arrive. Won't hold that against them, it could've been an off night. We will definitely give it another shot."}
{"text":"My husband and I joined another couple for a dinner date last Friday at Bar Cento. By far the best part of this bar is the ambiance. It was really cozy and romantic. We sat at a booth/table, tucked in a little corner and propped up on pillows. The lighting was low and perfect for a romantic dinner date. The wine and beer selection was extensive, and our server offered up tastings of wine before we committed to a full glass. Always a nice perk. Service was friendly but sparse, despite most of the tables being vacant is seemed like there was only one server for the entire room. Where Bar Cento fell flat was the food. They have a fairly extensive menu, mostly pasta, pizza and other Italian-American fare. My husband got the Ohio Beef Burger and he said everything about it was good except for the bun, which he ended up tossing to the side. I ordered the Carbonara, which I found bland and mushy. The pasta was overcooked and I could barely taste salt or pepper, the two main flavors I would expect from a Carbonara. Altogether, I would return to Bar Cento for drinks but I wouldn't be in a rush to return for dinner."}
{"text":"One star bc I have to. I was just KICKED by an employee because I was in his way. An \"excuse me\" would also be acceptable. Literally have the worst night of my life every time I come here


*****edit 

I thought this night was bad. But at 140 am they had a lot of aggressive police woman who were removing everyone from the establishment. It was only 140? Typically closing time is 2 am so I am not used to being aggressively removed from a bar prematurely."}
{"text":"I didn't eat I just came to have drinks. One drink that was featured on the menu was a Ginger Bourbon fizz, I ordered It and it was so bad! Probably one of the worst cocktails you could imagine for $9! The service was good but that drink was the pits! Take it off the menu! Also some of your seating needs to be repaired, there is stuffing hanging out and most of the glass is dirty along with dust on the lampshades above the bar."}
{"text":"Its happy hour time, I haven't eaten all day and I am in Ohio City so I figured I would give Bar Cento a try.  Stopped in at about 5pm on a Monday and the place was very quiet, just myself and another guy at the bar; although they did pick up a couple of other tables by the time I left.  

Bar Cento is a large place with a very nice feel, dark and warm; the kind of place to hang out for a while.  The front room has a bunch of booths and the the bigger room has more tables and a large bar.

Service was friendly and prompt.  From the Happy Hour menu I ordered the Pizza Bianco ($5) and the Mussels ($7).   The pizza is a dinner plate sized hand stretched pie with garlic slices, oil and cheese.  The pie is thin and crisp with a very nice crust, a bit greasy, but in a good way and just the right amount of garlic.  

The mussels were a nice portion of medium sized shellfish in a mild wheat bier broth; the mussels were expertly cooked, firm without being overcooked and with a nice mellow flavor.   The crispy toast pieces were perfect to soak up the extra broth.

A great atmosphere, excellent food and reasonable prices makes Bar Cento a great place to get your Happy Hour grub on."}
{"text":"I have been very tough on the shops and restaurants that make pizza in NEOhio through the years. I was beginning to think there was something about the water in the Lake Erie watershed that made it difficult to produce a premium crust. My first trip to Bar Cento proved that this is not the case. 

As my other pizza reviews will attest I much prefer Columbus cracker style crusts or NY style thin crusts. There are a number of places around that try to market one of these styles. Few succeed entirely. Bar Cento not only succeeds, but almost gets the best qualities of both styles. We ordered a margherita pizza with sausage added. The crust was very thin, slightly crispy, and full of flavor. Cheese was fresh and well proportioned as were the tomatoes and basil. The house made sausage was a perfect compliment.

On top of the great pizza, the restaurant is a really cool place. We dined and were gone within an hour (thanks to great service, which was also informative and friendly), but this is also a cool place to hang out. The Ohio City location is also a plus.

Bar Cento is definately going to be added to our regular rotation and may well be one of my top 3 favorite restaurants if they can provide the quality food and service consistently. I highly recommend you check it out if you have not already.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Duck fat fries. There really isn't any reason to order anything food item(unless you care about your cardiovasular health).  

Okay...maybe that isn't entirely true, I enjoyed my chard spaghetti, with carrots, red chilis and a white wine sauce. My friends seemed pretty satisfied with their various pizzas (except my friend that got the duck rhubarb pie, she was grossed out and disappointed). 

You might also want to wash down your fries with a beer from their extensive menu.

But really, focus on the fries...few potatoes can compare."}
{"text":"Love the pizza. First time I went, I just got pepperoni pizza, which is always standard and was SO delicious. Today I shared the Pommes Frites and Mussels with a friend. Mussels were so good. The Pommes Frites were good especially with the spicy mayo sauce, but they were extremely salty. I got the Spicy Chicken pizza with honey (interesting, right?) and it was pretty good but I really wish it was actually spicy. It did have a nice bite and the sundried tomatoes were a great touch"}
{"text":"The only thing salvaging this review is how amazing the apple & bacon pizza was. Seriously, to die for.

However, the service my friends and I received was truly terrible. Upon walking into the restaurant, there were two women about ten feet back from the podium, chatting. They must have assumed we were going straight to the bar (it was a Friday night around 10:30), because after we stood there long enough, one woman asked, \"oh, you want a table?\" 

After leading us to the table, our waitress gave us our menus and walked away without a word. When she finally returned, every question, every order, was met with an eye roll. She did not check on us, and she seemed to be walking around the restaurant in exasperation. All too happy to leave, we flagged her down and asked for our checks. 

We each, individually, gave her our debit cards with the appropriate check. They were returned separately. Now, when I checked my bank account a few days later, I noticed I was charged twice at Bar Cento. Once for my tab, and once for my friend's tab. She obviously swiped my card twice (our two cards are visibly different - one bright red with a big white key on it, the other a dark blue card) and didn't say a word about it when she returned our receipts and cards for signatures. 

Altogether, I ended up paying $40 for two beers. Fantastic. Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm torn between a 2 and a 3 for this specific visit. Kind of depends on what I'm talking about too because the service was great. I would give the service a 4. This isn't the first time I've come here but it is the first time we've ordered an actual meal. 
I ordered the lamb belly which I've never eaten before so I don't know what it is suppose to taste like but thought I would try something new. It comes with Risotto which is a fave of mine. The risotto was good the lamb belly...very tough.I actually didn't eat it. I chewed a piece then spit it out and didn't eat any more of it. Like I said maybe it's my fault for ordering and not knowing what to expect but just an FYI that it is tough. I had a piece of my friends pizza and that was delish."}
{"text":"I chose this place because it got good reviews on yelp and the pictures of pizza on here looked delicious! I was not disappointed!  :) I got the mushroom pizza and it was delicious! The staff were very friendly and attentive.  I'll definitely be back to visit again!"}
{"text":"Bar cento has a really extensive beer and wine list and they do a great happy hour! I got the burrata and a flatbread. The flatbread was really great and the burrata was a bit too rich for me, but such is the life of burrata. If you're not sitting at the bar, they have some super cool booths with gauzy drapes. The bartenders and friendly, helpful and personable and I would definitely add Bar Cento to your Ohio City bar crawl list!!"}
{"text":"Originally I was planning to go to Daves to grab a quick Sandwich but unfortunately they are closed on Sunday! So we stumbled into this place since it was the first one to pass walking up West 25. We ordered the burger and fries and the arugula capicola pizza. Both were over all not bad but at the same time they weren't amazing either. If I went back I wouldn't try this pizza again however I would go back to try one of the other pizzas on the menu."}
{"text":"Was trying to find a decent place to eat near Westside Market approx. 3:30 p.m. last saturday and all the Yelp four star+ restaurants didn't open till 5:00... enter Bar Cento.  Was seated immediately by a hostess who looked like she'd rather be at a funeral than at work.  The interior was dark and had a nice relaxed vibe.    

A sign out front of the establishment bragged about their pizza, so we opted for the odd combination of rosemary garlic fries and a Bianco pizza (cheese). My wife had a drink that was gin based and was one of the best drinks we have had in a while - unfortunately, I can't remember what the drink was called.  The pizza lived up to the hype (and then some) and is probably in my top four, or five, pizzas I've had since moving to Ohio 19 years ago - that pizza sauce was insane.  

Our waitress did a nice job, but the miserable hostess continued to float around the restaurant seemingly ready to strangle, or deck, the first person who pushed her buttons.  Another waitress walked by our table with a burger and fries and then returned seconds later telling the kitchen \"they didn't want it\", to which the kitchen workers replied \"cool!!!\".  They promptly began eating the contents of the plate which I found to be tacky even though I imagine this practice is more commonplace than I would like to think.  

Honestly, a pretty good experience.  That pizza is hard to beat.  The pizza at Broken Rocks Cafe in Wooster is still my favorite, but Bar Cento is nearly just as good."}
{"text":"Good experience we came during happy hour, and were very pleased. My wife ordered the mussels and was particularly pleased with the home made bread crisps that came with it. I ordered the angus burger and it was prepared just as I had ordered it, medium rare. Most places ask for temp, but rarely achieve it. We shared some fries, which were good but not my fave as they had sprigs of rosemary on them. The bartender was great and knowledgeable, and obviously brought up properly. All in all, very nice."}
{"text":"Always impressed with the delicious food at Bar Cento! The Apple and Prosciutto Pizza is a real winner. We had a wonderful server for our private party of 25! Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"-Lamb meatballs: cooked well&good flavor 
-Pommes Frites: crispy edges, soft center, props to the variety of dipping sauces 
-Big Board: If you order any appetizer, highly recommend. They get their meats and cheeses from local market across the street. Again, great variety.
-Capicola pizza: This one was the winner. Great flavor with some spice and fresh balance with the arugula salad
-Charred escorole: Perhaps prepared well, but too bitter for my taste
-Pasta with rabbit: Flavor not that impressive. Kind of bland"}
{"text":"I have frequented this establishment many times over the years.  I used to consider this place amazing, but it has definitely lost its steam.  As long as you don't stray from the pizza or pommes frites the food is good.  I've had some other items on the menu an they have failed to impress.  Twice recently I've gone here with a large party (7-8) people and have left completely annoyed.  The first trip with a large party we waited over an hour for our food.  The server apologized but nothing much more than that was provided.  The second trip with a large party was this weekend.  A friend had tried to buy cigs from the machine in the back and it ate his money.  Basically once this was brought to the attention of the server, the situation was not remediated, but handled poorly and inappropriately.  Our bills got slapped with a large party gratuity after half the party had left (and their bills did not have gratittuity attached).  The manager, Brent, not manage the situation but rather proceeded to argue and yell at members of our party.  At one point he was yelling at 2 members of our party at the front entrance.  He was more apt to argue the points brought forward rather than address the concerns of his customers.  What a loose cannon.  Definitely not a manager who is calm, cool, or collected, or can address and fix anything for his customers.  I'll be picking another option on W25th next time."}
{"text":"I went there Saturday night with some girlfriends.  We got right in at 7:00. Very cool atmosphere.  

I had the egg yolk & pancetta frascatelli which is just a fancy spin on carbonara.  It was delicious.  However, it was the smallest portion of pasta I've ever seen.  Certainly not worth the $22 price tag."}
{"text":"I'd love to comment about the food, but I didn't actually get any.  My friend wanted to go here one Saturday so we went and were told it would be 45 minutes for a table.  Not bad at all for a Saturday.  We figured we'd go back to Bier Market and have a few beers while we waited.  Fast forward 2 hours and we ended up leaving hungry and table-less.  Honestly, it wouldn't have been so bad if the staff wasn't so rude.  I get that things happen outside of your control...the problem is that there wasn't any control.  Anywhere.  After watching the giant cluster#%@* that was going on up front I can guarantee that no food is worth that.  I felt bad for the people who had reservations and were STILL waiting an hour past when they were supposed to have sat down.  I totally get that it was a crazy Saturday night, and if your staff had been a little nicer I'd be willing to give you another shot, but never again.  

This probably makes me sound like a complete jerk, and I kind of feel like one for writing it, but seriously, I'm about as undemanding a customer as you can get.  I've worked in food service.  Plenty of my friends have worked in food service.  Believe me, I get it.  Don't spit in my food or set me on fire or insult my mother and we're good to go.  But you can also add \"don't sass me after I've been waiting for more than twice as long as you told me I would\" to that list.  Neither you, nor your place of employment, are THAT cool.  Or maybe that's their schtick?  Being sassy and rude?  If it is, let me know and this'll be a whole different review 'cause you're great at that.  

The only upside was that I had one of the most delicious beers of my life from Bier Market while waiting.  Or maybe it just seemed that way because I was drinking on an empty stomach for two hours waiting for a table we never got.  

Maybe it's different on a weeknight, but there's really no reason for me to find out.  It's not like there's a shortage of restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Was here a while back with 3 other dining companions. I remember the fries being delicious and the pizza being very good as well, but everyone was unhappy with their entrees, especially for the price. The ambiance is very nice, however, and the service was good as well. If you come here, I would stick with the fries and the pizza and you'll probably leave happy."}
{"text":"Best fries EVER!  And that's saying a lot.  They are perfectly crispy, meaty in the middle, and the dipping sauces are awesome!  I crave these fries.

For us, the pizza was average with a not so flavorful crust that was a little overcooked.

The beer selection is awesome.  We had a cider we've never had before that we really enjoyed.

If you go, get the fries!"}
{"text":"Had a great bottle of italian pinot, pommes frites appetizer and 2 pizzas. First of all loved the decor and trendy atmosphere. We initially were seated towards the front & asked to move since it was extremely hot. We moved to the bar area in the back with no problem. Service was slow but they were definitely accomodating! I highly recommend the pommes frites! Amazing appetizer! We had wine, but they had an extensive beer list. We had the famous pancetta & egg pizza voted by food network. I thought it was too peppery, I did not care for it. My niece loved it. I really liked the marinara pizza. The sauce and crust was great. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!! I've been here three times. 

Once, we just ordered pizzas. Everyone suggested the pizza with an egg on it, but I just got the margherita pizza and it was so good! 

The next time, we got sangria and some appetizers, and it again, was delicious.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!

Went here on a double date and they sat us in the very front where all the action was. We were sat for 35 min with not ONE waiter coming to check on us so finally my friend got up and asked the hostess to send someone over.

They did comp our app's and first round of drinks which was nice, HOWEVER they were out of the main app we wanted and gave us the cheese tray :(

Now onto the food/drinks: The moscoule mule was so average it made me regret ordering it and then my friend ordered a beer on tap and they told him to enjoy it bc that's the last of it!
I got the arugala pizza which was decent, i've had way better. We were curious about the monkfish and our waiter told us \"its pretty average, we call it the poor mans lobster\". WHO SAYS THAT!?
Anywho, he got the \"poor man's lobster\" and it was just that. Came out very dry and luke warm. 

Overall it was a pretty bad experience all the way from the service to the food. There are too many good/cute places in ohio city to waste your time here."}
{"text":"I went to Bar Cento today and it was mediocre at best. I ordered the house red wine and the vegetarian burger. The wine was a little too bitter and acidic for my liking, but it only cost $5, so I suppose that is to be expected. I ordered the vegetarian burger for dinner and it was not good at all! The patty was way too big for the bun and was incredibly dry. There were no condiments to make the burger less dry and it was very hard to eat for that reason. The bun was really flaky and kept falling apart as I was eating. Also, I thought the burger and a side cost $6.50, but apparently a side costs more so this terrible burger with a mediocre side of spaghetti squash cost me $10!! The squash was prepared with brown butter was really good and I have never had anything like it; however, the portion was TINY and considering it cost me $3.50 it was just not worth it. The main reason I am giving this place 3 stars and not 2 is because my friend who went with me ordered the fries seasoned with rosemary and they were delicious!! It also came with roasted garlic on the side which added a kick to the side and I loved sharing the fries with her."}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's bday.  She rented out the back room which was pretty nice.  However, the service was disappointing.  We sat down and a couple came a few minutes later so we thought we'd move so they could sit together.  Nope, we got pretty much yelled at for moving seats because the waitress can't keep track of us if we keep moving.  I totally get what she was saying but she could've had a bit more patience with us.  Then, it took us forever to get the waitress's attention so we could order and she barely came to check in on us.  Even when we tried to get someone's attention for them to get the waitress to bring the birthday cake out, everyone was basically dodging us and not being very helpful.  

The 3 stars are mostly based on the food, which was actually really good.  I got a seafood cioppino thing... I can't remember but it was chock full of seafood and a yummy broth.  My friend tried the Sunnyside pizza, we thought \"Egg on pizza? Gotta try it.\" And it was really good! The pizza was actually quite big for one person so I would recommend sharing it (although I'm a little girl with a medium-size appetite).  

Would I come again? Probably not for dinner....maybe just to grab a quick drink and maybe a snack. I just can't stand the bad service."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar watching everyone in the food line in the kitchen handle ALL FOOD without gloves. Gross. Will not return."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere...smaller dinning room towards the front..huge double bar in the rear...large draft selection..i tried a local pilsner that was perfect temp and tasty.  For lunch I opted for a pizza the margarita was a little surprised that it didn't have fresh slices of mozz like I'm use to but the crust was super thin chewy but crisp on the edges...my mother in law chose the burger it was nice size and the meat was super fresh, the frites where hand cut and fried to perfection...over enjoyed the food pizza and burger prices where normal   but could see some other items much higher!"}
{"text":"An old blast from my past, Bar Cento is like the ex boyfriend whom I still adore... not that I really have that person but... Just roll with the metaphor here...

He's sure of himself: It's been a few years since I've been back, but damn if things aren't familiar. The vibe is chill, the menu remains similar and there are still some of my favorite pizzas on the list.

He's masculine: Dark and mysterious, strong and handsome. Bar Cento exudes confidence and coolness. And have you noticed the indoor gazebos?! I dig it.

He can cook: Back once more to the pizza! So good! This time around we ordered the sausage/pep duo and the bubbly crust, gooey cheese, and slightly spicy meats made me weak in the knees! (That's what she said... I digress.) The olives are baked with rosemary and have that specially spiced flavor and the \"family\" meat/cheese platter (olives included) is quite impressive. There were at least three or four different kinds of meat and cheese alone!

He can handle his booze: Let's talk about that awesome beer list folks! I mean, c'mon have you met his brother Bier Markt? The wine list sister is pretty good looking as well.

He keeps me coming back: Yes, he was THAT good... Even three years later. 

Thanks for reading and letting me have a little fun with my review. :) I really do enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. My friend and I shared a regular sized Pomme frites, which was the perfect amount for two hungry hungry hippos. Service was great. We then got the Pork Nduja pizza which was just bomb! The caramelized onions in there with the housemade pork was heaven. will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Only tried this place once on a trip to Cleveland. Very cool space. Huge selection of beers. I would stick to beer, mussels and the very good pizza. The fries were of the large chunky style, oily and not very crunchy. Vegetarians note the fries are cooked in duck fat! The flavored mayo they serve with them is delicious. Steak was over cooked and under seasoned. Excellent pizza crust, light, thin, crisp at the edge."}
{"text":"Abortion, Immigration, Religion, Heath Care & Pommes Frites. Each of these topics are equally political in nature. Throughout history, each have caused great divide, passion and emotion among those who discuss. 

Fresh cut, steak fries, waffle, wedges, tots or curly? Fried in oil, duck fat or oven roasted? Saturated or unsaturated? Ketchup, mayo, malt vinegar, chili or cheese? French Fries, Freedom Fries or Pommes Frites? Who's fries are the best? Such heated topics continue to divide a nation. 

Now that the issues are out there for all to debate, it is without further hesitation that I draw a line in the sand and announce my endorsement for Bar Cento and the Pommes Frites party. 

I could go on in a series of overly bearing, over romanticizing, over the top foodie adjectives to describe just how perfect these fries are. Or I can just ask that you trust my research. Discovering a fry that has inspired a dedicated review in and of itself such as this should be complement enough, but I must say, Bar Cento's frites are so good, they are life altering. Because of these fries, I am a better person.  

Fresh cut, crisply fried in duck-fat, seasoned properly with a touch of salt, rosemary sprigs and crushed garlic cloves. Accompanied by several complimentary sauces including mayos in garlic, curry and chile flavors. I have never tasted a fry as good as Bar Cento's Belgian Pommes Frites. To live a life without engrossing oneself in fries like these is a life incomplete."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Bar Cento for years, even before Ohio City became what it is now and I am a loyal fan to the end because of two things: Pomme Frites and Sunnyside Pizza. Sounds simple enough, but it's more than just fries and pizza.  They have perfected the Pomme Frites-probably the best in northeast Ohio.  Fried in duck fat and just the right thickness, they come with four different delicious dipping sauces (my favorite is the curry sauce).  There is also a scattering of rosemary and fresh garlic that really pulls it all together.   I can never finish mine, despite how good they are so I take them home with me and bake them in the oven. They are just as good the next day! Now, the Sunnyside pizza is equally fantastic.  The house made prosciutto, Cheese and Egg are a perfect marriage of flavor and that crust is everything.  I just can't say enough good things about my favorite foods at Bar Cento. I have a friend from Cleveland who moved to Chicago and every time she comes for a visit, Bar Cento is a MUST, no if ands or buts!"}
{"text":"The Sunnyside pizza (provolone, housemade pancetta, blue loon farm eggs, black pepper), might be the best pizza in Cleveland. God bless Bar Cento for being consistently open until 2:30am and having the freshest, most delicious food possible without compromising quality. Bar Cento is a crowd pleaser for everyone in your party, and you will undoubtedly have excellent leftovers. 

The extensive wine and beer list is w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l. This is one of the few places about town where I can actually order a Framboise and pretend i'm still living in Europe. You can find an appropriate drink pairing for anything on the menu, and the price range of options is very generous. 

In the summer, they have nice outdoor seating. Full disclosure: some outdoor panhandling does occur on West 25th, so if this might make your guest uncomfortable, I would sit inside. This isn't the restaurant's fault, and they typically address it quickly. Additionally, when it comes to the crowds, I never see a pattern with how and when Bar Cento is slow or packed. Typically, I always make a reservation to be on the safe side. You may want to do the same!"}
{"text":"Jiminy Christmas, this place is great. I went with a large group of friends, so everybody ordered something different, giving us a chance to nosh on a few different things. Firstly, the pommes frites table platter was hands-down the finest fries I've had in the Midwest. (O.K., I haven't been to Duluth, so sue me.)

The veggie burgers are top-notch, and I found the pizza excellent. My friend ordered the roasted mushroom pizza, with salumi, mozzarella, and thyme...hot damn. As a wise man once said, \"That shit was good.\""}
{"text":"I can say this is my favorite place in Cleveland now. My husband and I went here twice actually in one night because we liked it so much. 

The first time it was mid afternoon and we stopped for a couple drinks and an appetizer. We sat at the bar and had the lamb meatballs. Those changed my life and my whole idea of meatballs. People don't give meatballs enough credit and I think that's because they have never tried the lamb meatballs at Bar Cento. They were the juiciest, most flavorful meatball I have ever had. I would drive to Cleveland just to have that meatball. We had a side house salad which was fresh and tasty and the dressing was light and very good as well. And there was an entree with them an pappardelle that I have been dreaming about getting. 

We went back late that night and got the pizza Bianco (which was rated as the #1 pizza in ohio by food network) and it lived up to what our expectations were. It was super thin and crispy and garlicky and I have never had a pizza like that. It was unique and absolutely the best white pizza I have ever had. 

This is exact place everyone looks for but never really finds. It's the perfect place to hang out, drink and eat delicious food. I wish this was in my backyard...well if it was I would drink and eat a lot more that's for sure. The bar tenders were very nice and knew what that were doing no question. 

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I split the Linguine and Margherita pizza. Both were so good - we ate every bite. We also had a dessert, I can't remember the specific name, but it was made up of a strawberry flavored jello/mousse with lemon pound cake and topped with strawberries. 

Would DEFINITELY go back again when in the CLE area."}
{"text":"Kim's QATTPR (Quick And To The Point Review).

IN THE FORM OF GREATNESS
Oh Pommes Frites, you make me wanna move to France.. but wait one, two, three dipping sauces...now that can only happen in America!!  Yes we love our options and our insanely caloric sauces.  Anyway, in the land of Sam red bell pepper mayo is the king and queen rose aka rosemary basically takes these fried potatoes from zero to hero in a millisecond.  In sum, order them.. order ten. 

MIXED FEELINGS
After 35 minutes of scratching my head and 50 pommes frites later I ordered the Marinara tomato sauce, mozzarella, provolone pizza... I vocalized my passion for marinara sauce so much so that the server agreed to give me an extra side (insert smiling ear to ear)..well yeah the side came.. cold & lumpy.. I tried it, denied it and yes that is the reason for the mixed feelings... epic disappointment. 

BAD TO THE BONE
Just a personal pet peeve but if you are OUT of a wine on the menu, man up and give me something equivalent instead of one up-ing me into buying something more expensive because this leads me to wonder... \"did you really run out of that glass or you are just hoping for a bigger tip?\"  Cuz guess what I bartend too and that's well sleazy young geezy. 

peace, blessing, salad dressing

{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have conflicting impressions. The first time I went my boyfriend and we got pizza and it was really good. Next time I went with my family and everyone either got pizza or a main dish and everyone was satisfied. However, last weekend my boyfriend and I went back and both got two different pasta dishes and they were terrible. I have never sent food back at a restaurant but this is the closest I've ever come. I got the carbonara and it was decent (at best) but certainly not worth the $22 we were charged for it....and he got the penne and I legitimately do not know how he finished it. We had to add salt to it to make it even somewhat edible but I've never been more disappointed in a restaurant. Without a doubt neither dish was worth their cost. Only reason I'm not giving bar cento one star is because their pizza is impressive, they have a prime location, and service is good. There is no doubt in my mind they would just be better off taking all pasta off the menu because it is awful."}
{"text":"I went here last night my service was good. 
I ordered a flatbread which was crisp, cheesy, and perfect. 
However, I had ordered the creme brûlée which had came with fried dough which was extremely raw and not edible what so ever. It also had an odd texture from the corn meal it was made with. 

I will go back again but definitely stay far away from the creme brûlée , which really is disappointing since it is my favorite dessert."}
{"text":"If I were basing this review on the Belgian fries only i would give it 5 stars. by far the best and most delicious fries i've ever had! they use fresh garlic and rosemary for flavor it is DELICIOUS

however i'm also including the other food in this review which i don't think is as fab. the pizza is thin crust and very plain and bland. i've ordered about 2-3 pizzas from here trying to give it a 2nd chance but they just aren't impressing me. and they are terrible leftovers [better in the oven than microwave]

i've had the happy hour burger and that was YUMMYYYYY but you have to order all toppings on the side. very very good burger. lots of flavor that you wouldn't expect.

i suggest you make a reservation if you're going during popular hours. i've gone one friday with over an hour wait and then another week the whole place was empty. hard to gauge.

~~~~~FRIES ARE 2 THUMBS UP!~~~~~"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Noisy ambiance because of the young, drinking crowd.  W25th street very active outside, but made for good \"people watching.\""}
{"text":"Completely unmemorable. Sure... they have some beers but you can get most at better places. In a city with fantastic breweries and great food/beer culture... why? Belgians are just not my thing I guess.

I'm not sure why people love it. Perhaps we didn't get great service because we came in with our kids? Not sure... but I wont be back (maybe they like it better that way)."}
{"text":"I've only ever smelled the food, and it does smell good. But my favorite thing about this place is the club/bar in the basement. I frequent this place in Friday and it is always jumping.  The Dj plays some ole 90s to current and local music and it's awesome. The only thing is it's 2 small and way to hard to get a drink. I would give this place five stars if it didn't always seem like the bartender was ignoring u.  But in their defense it's too damn crowded and it's not enough bartenders. They could do wonders if they just had a little stand u could by beers at. Maybe even mixed drinks. But I will be back."}
{"text":"The pizza was bomb! I had the mushroom and caper pizza and it was amazing. They had two sides, one with music and one without. The drinks were affordable but the staff were a little cranky which is why I gave it 4 stars. Despite some of the staff, I would come here again for the pizza."}
{"text":"First, I love that you can make a dinner reservation at Bar Cento - especially on a Friday night! (Hate it when you can't make a reservation or you can only make reservations if it's for 8 people or more) Love the decor! We had the Arancini for appetizer - yum, would have loved a bit more tomato sauce with them though. 
I had the Vegan pizza (but I'm not a vegan) - it was delicious and looked beautiful as well. There was something in it that gave it a little spicy flavor, not too much though. The rest of the crew loved their meals and the wine & beer. A bit more wine by the glass selection would have been nice...."}
{"text":"Love Bar Cento! One of my favorite Cleveland spots.... Strongly recommend the Sunnyside Pizza..."}
{"text":"Another Ohio City gem that I'm happy to keep coming back to, and probably should more frequently. Just the fact that they share real estate with a Belgian beer bar is reason enough, but the food is also damn good. I think their pizza (love the Margherita and the mushroom) and pastas are especially strong. Recently I had a dish of parsnip gnocchi, and then a bite of my mother-in-law's mac and cheese with chicken and broccoli rabe, and both were out of this world. Service has always been pleasant for me. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and wine.  The fries, like everyone says, are quite tasty.  Happy hour is a good deal, $5 burgers and $3 fries every day from 4:30 to 7.  I'm a big fan of Belgian lambic, and they have a wide assortment of flavors to choose from here, and they even have framboise on draft!"}
{"text":"Overall a really cool place for dinner or drinks!

I decided to take my parents here for dinner a weekend I was home, and it was a great start to the evening. They still had reservations available that afternoon (although my parents thought 8:00 was a little late for dinner...), and when we walked into the cool atrium-like front area, a hostess immediately greeted us, took our reservation and seated us. I was really happy that she sat us in the front area, as it had a really intriguing layout. All of the doors up front were open, and the large entranceway gave the feeling of being semi-outside. There seemed to be a curtained-off employee area in the center of the room, and the perimeter booths were elevated from the main floor. The ambiance was very cool for the evening, and I really enjoyed spending time in the restaurant.

Our waitress came over and was very friendly and accommodating to my parents' indecisiveness when ordering anything. Feeling the classy atmosphere, I ordered a tempranillo but was disappointed. My parents' Eastern European beer selections were great, however, and I ordered a delicious craft beer to follow up. My mushroom pizza was delicious and enormous--I couldn't have eaten more than half of it! Also, their garlic and rosemary fries were amazing! I would come back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"This was the most delicious dinner out that I have had in a very long time.  For an appetizer we shared the beet ravioli which was the perfect amount of food and super tasty.  It was something different that looked intriguing and it was simple and satisfying.  I ordered the flank steak which was served medium-rare and was served with some sort of wild mushrooms & mashed potatoes.  Everything was as good as it could have possibly been. I am not the slightest fan of mushrooms whatsoever, but we both agreed that these mushrooms were amazing, and we are both not mushroom fans.  The steak was cooked perfectly, and I did not leave one bite on my plate.  I was 100% satisfied, and look forward to going back in the future."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the service was a bit sluggish. Sucks to sit outside and be harassed by the homeless. But I will give it another chance."}
{"text":"Maybe it is just me, but I really don't see what all the hype is about this place.  I have tried it 2 times and was disapointed both times.   Once I sat up at the bar with a friend.   The bartender was not exactly rude, but he was not exactly friendly either.  Very standoffish and very slow to wait on us.  Oddly, the place was fairly empty at the time, which made it worse.  We both ordered pizza.  No good.  The crust was like a cracker.  Very thin and way to dry and crunchy.  I am a fan of New York style pizza, having grown up there.  I did not like this pizza at all.  The second time I went there I had a pasta dish with a side of string beans.  The beans were very oily and had steams sticking out the ends.  The pasta was ok, but nothing special.  With so many other good restaurants in the area like Lolita and the Tremont Tap house to name a few, I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"I can appreciate a solid beer list and Bar Cento's got it covered.  I was also slightly and pleasantly surprised when our server for the evening could expound on the characteristics of any particular beer we pointed it.  Any place could put beer on the menu, but what sets Bar Cento apart, in my experience, is the staff's ability to be beer snobs for your benefit.

We actually went there for the late-night food.  And while the menu was impressive and unique, the pizza we ended up with was not.  Still, I'd be happy to go back and give it another try."}
{"text":"I love Bar Cento, and have lately been eating dinner here way more than I should. Although I wish different, pizza is not a health food. The pies are great, especially the marinara with any topping you want, my faves are pepperoni or mushroom. Burgers also excellent. I always sit at the bar, which allows me to watch the food being made, sample different drinks, and chat with fellow beer/pizza lovers. Ingredients are great and often local, and you pay a little extra for that, but worth it in my book. Also, they serve food til 2am, which is unheard of in this town, and awesome."}
{"text":"The only reason this gets two stars is because the atmosphere was good and the food was done well too. I went with a large party (about 20 people). We went on a Sunday night, it was not very busy at all. Service started out alright but just went downhill as the night went on. Our waiter was ok. Not rude, but not friendly either. The hostess, every time we saw her, gave us eye rolls. Also, while the food was great, I'm in no rush to go back for a 15 dollar personal pizza. Sorry, it's just not THAT good. There are plenty of other great pizza places in northeast ohio that cost far less for pizza that's just as good. I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Three stars to Bar Cento for being the good at what it does. The pizza, the burger, are as good as it gets. The fries are off the charts. And I had a special hanger steak that was flawless. Service was fine. Always look forward to Bar Cento. 

Update: The food is still fine, if you can get service. IF. 

You may be ignored indefinitely. ( and repeatedly may I add...)"}
{"text":"First of all, made a reservation on Mother's Day to secure table. Get there, overbooked, understaffed, 5 people crammed into a table of 4 by the food running area. Strike 1. The server was also the bartender responsible for drinks for the entire restaurant. Strike 2. Comes by with waters, gets drink orders, disappears for a 20 minutes. Returns, gets food order, doesn't write it down. Disappears. Over an hour later, the food begins to come out. The appetizer that we put in did not. I alert the server, she acknowledges, then walks the opposite direction away from the kitchen and begins making drinks again at the bar. Strike 3,4, does it matter anymore? Food finished coming out, I alert the runner that we did not get our appetizer of fries. He acknowledges then goes back. Food is almost finished at this point (which by the way was under-seasoned, soggy, oily, and far from enjoyable). Since the server has not returned, I go up to the bar to get her attention. I hand her my credit card and informed her that the appetizer never came out at all, let alone before the main course, and that she will be taking it off the bill before swiping the card and returning to the table with a check to fill out. 

Without going into further detail about an extremely poor experience from start to finish, I would just like to make a few final remarks. The first is that I'm willing to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt on a busy day like Mother's Day. The problem with that in this situation is that the restaurant, was not overbooked. There were tables in every section open, 3 hosts, 3 food runners, etc. For the volume that they presently had, the restaurant was appropriately staffed, and should not have had the kind of serving situation that was experienced. Second, if a server is overstretched I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, in this case, the server made it very clear that she did not intend to check up on the table, or follow up on the concern about not receiving some of the order. She made no effort to indicate that the table she was given mattered as her priority was clearly on the bar. Third, if a restaurant has decent food, poor or mediocre service can sometimes be overlooked. I have been to Bar Cento 3 times. The first time was pretty good, I had the pizza, no problems, worth a return. Second time, brought relatives from out of the town, and the food was laughable. It was very clear that quality and portion were both being sacrificed. So I was willing to give them one more chance. 

My final concensus with Bar Cento is this: the one decent meal I have had there out of three was the fluke. Their baseline is mediocre food, mediocre service, and mediocre standards for everything. Also, their attempt to appear eco-friendly and hip by using recycled straws is a joke considering none of their food is organic, non-gmo, or any effort towards a healthy life style. The menu uses fancy terms to appeal to that demographic but does not back any of their product with substance. Bar Cento, Market Garden, and Nano continue to just fail in every aspect: food, service, lifestyle, and beer."}
{"text":"With 145 (now 146) reviews, Bar Cento barely needs anymore kind words from me. Oh I'm writing them anyway, don't you worry...

I made a reservation through Yelp, which was super cool, for my three friends and I. The host was so friendly, not to mention beardy and attractive but that's neither here not there... They sat us close the the back of the restaurant in a very comfy leather booth. All of you already know about the wonderfully cozy decor and mood lighting for hot dates, so no need to go in to that.

The food was a whole other animal. Spicy chicken pizza? Yes please! Although I do have to say, it wasn't very spicy at all. The flavors though, oh the flavors! So delicious and just a hint of sweet. The crust was thin and crispy with a touch of garlic which I love with all my heart, garlic. I may have eaten the whole thing....I'm only slightly ashamed. Bar Cento is a great place for food, drink, and general merriment. Which is what we're all looking for in life anyways, right?"}
{"text":"Meh...
The atmosphere here is so awesome, and kind of like making your way through different little room-sized worlds. Unfortunately, the variety of food, menu options, and creativity-to-flavor ratio were not satisfactory. Maybe other people come here for the atmosphere and drinks, but I'm a foodie, and didn't find the pizza or the frites to be all that. Again, meh. Good for them for the way they source, but the food just wasn't my jam."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant but I think it's seen its day. The food was horrible. I ordered ravioli and it was so overcooked that there was no filling. We waited about an hour for one of our friends pizzas to be made and brought to the table. Drinks, forget it because it was over an hour for one, one drink to come to the table. I think it needs to be revamped and remanaged. So sad."}
{"text":"I would give this 3.5 if I could, but I can't, so I downgraded to three on account of the price and generally small portions.

We went to eat on a Saturday afternoon between lunch and dinner, and the restaurant was quiet and our waiter was attentive and really good. My husband started with a beer and liked the list to choose from, but I stuck with water. Mom ordered the pommes frites and the family really liked them - I passed because they are fried in duck fat. 

Portions were small and kind of pricey. My sister and I split a veggie burger with a side of brussels sprouts and the arugula pizza. The veggie burger was good, but not great. The sprouts were pretty tasty, but the serving was pretty small. The pizza was flavorful and yummy with carmelized onions, arugula, garlic, pine nuts, and mozzarella. Mom and my husband both had the cavatelli, which they both agreed was very rich but good. Their servings were also pretty small. My husband was unimpressed with his side salad. 

Dessert looked intriguing, but not for the price. We picked up Campbell's cupcakes on our way home.

So - good, not great. If I were going to spend this much on lunch/dinner next weekend, this would not be my place of choice. Neat atmosphere though - would probably be better for happy hour specials and hanging out for a bit after work."}
{"text":"I struggle with how to review bar centro for a few reasons. I went here on date night from a recommendation from a chef, but thought the food was sub par, and average. We had reservations at 8:30 on a Friday night, and were quickly seated at our table right on the nose with water glasses. It wasn't until 8:53 that our server finally came over to introduce herself. It was at the tipping point of us planning on just walking out. She apologized for the wait, but I don't think she realized how long we had actually been sitting there, as I had not seen her walk by once. She took our appetizer, entree and drink orders all at once, and we ordered a flight of beers. When they came, I noticed one was incorrect, and when she brought our appetizer I pointed it out and she brought the correct beer. Next our food arrived, but she did not check on us until I had finished my entire pizza. My boyfriend had stopped halfway though his food to ask for a condiment, which took a few minutes, despite being located directly across from the kitchen counter. The waitress wasn't rude or anything, but barely spoke 20 words to us and gave little service. If you scroll down on reviews, you can clearly see this is a continuous issue that they have. I don't know if the miscommunication was between the hostess and waitress that we had arrived or if she just had too many tables, but it was lacking. You receive the same service at a chipotle or similar fast casual restaurant. We ordered a pizza and veggie burger, both of which were very average. Given the location, there are so many other restaurants that I would rather eat at. Same time and money and go somewhere else! PS you can see many 1 or 2 star reviews that are 'not recommended' aka have been paid to be hidden. Not a good sign. I gave three stars because the food wasn't bad, and the server wasn't rude, but it definitely wasn't a good overall experience."}
{"text":"Bar Cento is one of our favorite places for late night food in Ohio City. Great selection of beers and mixed drinks, and service is always prompt and attentive.  Can get loud on Saturday nights! Pizza is our go-to; the chicken sausage, shrimp, and farm egg sunny side are always good.  The fries and roasted Brussels sprouts are also excellent sides."}
{"text":"Bar Cento is one of my Ltd night go to spots. There table share of fries is amazing. The crowd is lively and the beer menu amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for pick-up because they cook/serve late night. I go and pick it up and ask for a glass of wine, immediately noticing that i don't want one, it's dead, she is closing and there is no one there besides the bar maid and a cop. She says no, offer's me water, twice, weird. I said no, and in the midst of ringing up my pizza, asks again. Weird. I had already decided I was not going have a glass before she said no upon viewing the atmosphere. They were obviously closing. I didn't tip; I was taking the pizza to go. Then, as I am getting in the car, the cop calls to me, approaches me and grills me asking if I had been drinking etc. Really? It seemed to me that she was pissed I didn't tip her and sent him after me. Another time, I sat at the bar w/a gay friend of mine and when I asked a guy if he was a gay, a chic (turned out to be a bartender there) starting screaming at me, accusing me of being against gays etc. We had quite an extensive tab ($80) and the bartender told us to leave that \"our kind were not wanted.\" ? Bob and I walked across the street and found out they own the Market Brewery and were \"warned, told not let us in.\" So, I don't want to give them any business anymore. I have twice now been accused and harassed by untruths. Enough. That is not a good time to me."}
{"text":"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised about this place.  Being a Cle transplant, I didn't know about it.  I just followed my friends in for some drinks on a lazy Saturday afternoon.  I didn't expect such good food.  We ordered several pizzas, fries,  some steak, and the mussels.  We weren't really planning on it, but we shared all our food.  All dishes were wonderful. The fries and pizzas were really standouts to me as both were crazy flavorful.  

Service was slow, and there were some errors that were fixed.  But there was only one server for the whole place (about 7 tables).  But, she was really nice, and worked her ass off.  I am not sure how it normally is.

All in all, I am so glad I became acquainted with Bar Cento and will definitely be back for more tastiness."}
{"text":"Nestled in the heart of Ohio City is a place that has an amazing one-two punch for foodies and beer geeks alike. Bar Cento! Their pizza has been rated the best in Cleveland in the past and the rest of their food options are equally tops. Also, you can order beer from whatever Beir Markt has in stock right next door as the two places share an entrance and seating area up front. I'm a huge fan of their pizzas and their French fries, which come with 5 dipping sauces, all of which are tasty as hell! Come with an appetite and leave trying to avoid a food coma. The decor is awesome, dark, and intimate which makes this place awesome for date nights. If you want great food and equally great beer all in one place, look no further."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 10 rowdy people. They were able to accommodate us with no problem. We sat at this huge table in front. The server was amazing, not that he did anything special but dealt with all our bs. The pizza was excellent and the frys were amazing. They also had a great beer selection. One of the guys in our group opted for some pudding cake and wasn't a fan but the server took it off the bill without us even asking. After dinner we went to the bar that is attached which was also great."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Bar Cento when we stopped in for a late dinner on a weeknight. A solid list of beers on tap and by the bottle was a welcome sight, and I promptly ordered a pint. We started with a cheese and charcuterie plate that was creative, unique and delicous. The housemade coppa was some of the best I've tried anywhere. 

Next up we shared a large order of fries with dipping sauces. Piping hot and crisp on the outside, they were a fat kid's dream under the guise of fancypants packaging. We ordered two pizzas, one with egg that could have been ordered at breakfast or late-night, and another with pepperoni and mushroom. I never made it to the latter as I just had to have a second slice of that delicious egg-topped pie. Do yourself a favor and give it a whirl."}
{"text":"So here's a fun fact:  the first time I heard of Bar Cento was from a Swede in Brazil.  This is exactly how far Bar Cento's reputation precedes them.  When I returned to Cleveland I felt obligated to visit and try the much raved of french fries.  
Let me just say this.  If you like food, get the French fries.  Here are some words to help convince you: \"duck fat, garlic, and rosemary.\"  Convinced?  Great.  
After going a few times I had the opportunity to notice more than the fries.  Bar Cento has a swank atmosphere and delicious pizza.  The service was great too!  It also has a good location, so you can stop by the west side market, or grab something off the Great Lakes' tap then head on over."}
{"text":"I cannot wait to go back! 

The service was amazing, the atmosphere was so relaxing and almost romantic in a rustic way, the drinks went down quickly and the food was mouthwatering. I would go back everyday if I could afford it and if I wouldn't gain a ton of weight. 

Our server was so sweet, she was very knowledgeable about the food and the drinks. The fries are a MUST! So deliciously made with rosemary and garlic accompanied by 4 different delicious sauces. I ordered the roasted beet salad which was light and refreshing, exactly what I needed. And my guy ordered a sandwich with extra fries, thanks babe! 

I would definitely return again and my guy said this was one of his favorite places we have dined for dinner in Ohio City. And this says a lot coming from that picky service guy."}
{"text":"I'm not a drinker and as such I don't go to bars - ever.  After a long day checking out the CIA's BFA exhibit with my little sister we decided to hit the West Side Market and after picking up some cupcakes from Grandma Freda's decided that some proper food would be ideal before digging into the cupcakes (for the sake of full disclosure I'll admit I ate the Red Velvet before dinner.)  Having heard great things about Michael Nowak's inventive cuisine and high end ingredients I'll admit I was curious about Bar Cento before even going to Cleveland for the day and the fact that they had an extensive list of unique beers certainly appealed to my sister.

Entering the surprisingly larger front-patio area we were greeted by a friendly hostess who asked us whether we would prefer the (loud!) outside area or the more subdued interior - given the fact that techno-esque music blared outside and I heard Pearl Jam's Black playing inside we opted for the indoors -  a great choice as we were treated to Zeppelin, the Doors, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam throughout our meal.   

Comfortably seated at a small table near the bar we browsed the menu (myself the food and my sister the beer) and chatted while our quirky server buzzed around the restaurant replacing silverware on tables, placing bread baskets with olive oil (which we notably never received,) and pushing beer/alcohol orders - thankfully my sister ordered a beer or I fear we'd have been pressured to order drinks throughout the meal.  Receiving her beer my sister noted it was quite good - to me it tasted like beer.  Ordering two pizzas we sat and chatted while watching the cooks in the open kitchen spin dough, chop vegetables, and assemble the pies.

No more than 15 minutes passed before we were brought our well cooked thin-and-crispy pizzas, ideally prepared with just a little bit of char on the edge.  The first option, Apple and Prosciutto Pizza with Gorgonzola and red wine was a great blend of sweet and savory with wonderfully sweet and tender skinless apples contrasting eloquently against the somewhat crisp and amply salty prosciutto.  Adding a layer of creaminess a small amount of un-salty gorgonzola was added to the dish along with a slight bit of bitterness coming from the merlot.  Hints of chives and possibly coriander also crept though with bites towards the center and as a whole this was as good, if not better than the Brie pizza at Spagio in Columbus - with a much better crust.

The second pizza, Sunnyside Pizza with eggs, provolone, pancetta, and lots of black pepper lived up to its name - IE, it tasted like a lot of Black Pepper - and maybe some eggs.  A noted fan of all things featuring a yolk I had very much looked forward to trying this pizza but unfortunately any nuance or subtlety was entirely eliminated by the incredible degree of over seasoning.   Salty Pancetta, the tongue/mouth-feel of yolk, and pepper pepper pepper.  I will admit I appreciated the crispy and perfect crust of this pie, but otherwise a piece of bread with olive oil (which we weren't given) topped with black pepper would have been nearly on par.
After our meal we were offered desserts (ironically, Jeni's Ice Creams) but instead opted to eat our cupcakes from Grandma Freda's while listening to some Nirvana.  

All told I must admit I was modestly impressed with Bar Cento and the prices were certainly manageable compared to the vastly overpriced and overhyped Lola - I'd like to go back at some point for the chicken and gnocchi.  According to my sister, the alcohol list was quite extensive and affordable, so perhaps for beers and bites the place would be better and I bet it would also be a good place to catch a Cavs game - certainly better than average \"bar food\" and a setting/scene better than the average \"dive bar.\""}
{"text":"We stopped in to Bar Cento for their yummy mussels and some beer.  They had a beer called 'Kwack', which was really, really tasty.  It was served in a glass that does not stand on its own, which was held up by a wood pedestal.  The beer was awesome and so were the mussels.  They have a happy hour from 12:30 - 5PM on Sundays, so stuff was cheap! 

Twas good!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed in the short ribs. Have a personal policy to order short ribs when I see them in the menu. Not as tender as they should be. Felt like I was eating a steak. House salad was good and service was friendly. As I'm visiting. I'm not sure if come back to this establishment when I return."}
{"text":"First time here. We made reservations for a group of 17 people. The service was good. The place is a little pricey. We ordered the Pommes Frites to share with 4 people. The portion was more than enough. I also tried the Mixed Olives, the Charcuterie Board, and the Bianco Pizza. All were good. I ordered the Bronzino Al Cartoccio, which is the Mediterranean sea bass \"baked in paper\". It was very good. I would order it again but it was kinda pricey for the portion size. We also ordered the Squid Ink Gnocchetti which turned out to be too salty. I would be willing to go here again to try other entrees."}
{"text":"Am I in Bier Market? Or Bar Cento?

We went out one night to try Bar Cento. I was a tad confused when I walked into, what I had thought was Bier Market, and found that even though they were all connected... it was Bar Cento. Weird.

I ordered a jolly pumpkin ale to start the night. The waitress stated, \"I just wanted to let you know it's not pumpkin flavored.\" OMG. I replied back with a , \"yes, I'm fully aware of that.\" haha. She must get that question a lot.

I was intrigued to try the \"Cleveland's best pizza\" and best \"pomme frites\" that people have raved about. I ordered the sunnyside pizza- egg, provolone, black pepper, pancetta. I thought it had a tad too much pepper for my taste..and it just...wasn't that great. Just... flat, nothing great, nothing \"wow\" about it. My friend ordered another pizza...and it was exactly the same. I asked her how she liked it and she stated, \"umm it's nothing spectacular but it's okay.\"

The pomme frites... were so-so. My friend next to me got some type of fish dish..which he claimed was a so-so as well. The others got salads..but that's hard to rate.

Don't get me wrong. The service was nice, the setting's laid back, etc. In terms of the foodie..this isn't the place where I would say, \"you just have to try this place!\". But in terms of late night eats when you're out? Sure, definitely stop by bar cento for something to fill the stomach...."}
{"text":"Went here today for Happy Hour. Great prices... $6 for a burger, $4 for a good heaping portions of fries, $5 for a whole Bianca pizza, and $3.50 for beer. Here's when the good ends.

Service is extremely slow. The restaurant was joined with Bier Market, as in you can sit in either Bar Cento or Bier Market to eat the food at Bar Cento, and drink the beer at Bier Market. Good in concept, but painfully slow in delivery. Took like 15 minutes to get our beers, another 30 minutes to get our food. We asked for more ketchup.. by the time the ketchup came, the burger was already cold! Also asked for burger to be cooked medium well... came out to be medium rare. Flavor of the burger was lacking; needed tons of ketchup. Bianca pizza looks large, but isn't filling. Also could have used more flavor for the pizza. Super super oily as well.

But hey, they won some Food Network's pizza award for a reason? Maybe I just ordered wrong?"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, really I do! I've come here once on my own free will, got a burger that was bland and over-cooked. Had no interest in going back but due to a few social gatherings being held there by friends and/or family, I've been back 4 more times. I've tried something completely different from my last order every time and still have been left with the feeling of disappointment. There are so many better restaurant choices in Cleveland...even many choices on or around 25th. I'm done wasting my money at this establishment."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but my entree was borderline inedible. The chicken ravioli was possibly one of the most bland things I have ever eaten- gummy pasta, broth that was like lukewarm water. The duck was ok, the fries were ok--but just ok. It was very underwhelming, after reading such great reviews. You couldn't pay me to go back.!"}
{"text":"bar cento was recommended to my boyfriend and i by friends of ours from the area. so we had high hopes, and they were fulfilled.
i don't remember which beer i got, but it was some sort of heavy stout or porter that i really liked. my boyfriend ordered a beer that was still on the menu, but they no longer had, so they made recommendations and he went with what was his second choice to begin with.
for an appetizer we got marinated olives. super tasty, way too many to finish though! for our entree, we both got the steak and frites. sooooo gooood! the steak came with a glaze on the side, it was just ok, but the rest of the dish was amazing. the frites had whole chunks of garlic thrown in and came with a side of aioli. the dish was too much to finish, but everything was just as good left over.
our server was also super friendly and helpful. my boyfriend has a mild dairy allergy, and he made sure everything in the dish was ok for him to eat. he was good at giving us recommendations as well."}
{"text":"Bar Cento is one of my favorite spots in Cleveland, both for the food and the atmosphere.  Excellent food, excellent beer and wine menu, and definitely with reasonable prices, especially during happy hour.  The food selection isn't quite as good as it was when Jonathan Sawyer was the chef there (he has since started Greenhouse Tavern on East 4th - well worth visiting!), but it is still great atmosphere, great food and great drinks.  The amazing Michael Symon-style stone oven pizzas are definitely the highlight of the menu, along with the Belgian Frites.  Also recommend the Mussels.  I love that they always have a house white and house red wine on the menu for just $5.  Service is always friendly, and they carry Jeni's Ice Creams for dessert.  Love Bar Cento!  One of the best spots in the city and open until 2am every day!"}
{"text":"First time at Was today on OCTOBER 31st 2014. The pizza is some of the best in Cleveland. I would recommend going and I will be back. Great service as well."}
{"text":"No doubt that for a relaxed but never boring \"pizza and fries night\", the place to go is Bar Cento. Jonathan Sawyer is Cleveland's best young chef and I can't wait for his new restaurant, Greenhouse Tavern on E. 4th St. 

The atmosphere is dark and hip and the music is always well chosen classic rock or house music. Beer and wine lists are extensive and reasonably priced. The menu is relatively small, but doesn't need to be because everything is always good and the menu changes frequently. 

I echo the other reviews that hands down, this is the best fries in the city. Rubbed in rosemary and baked garlic cloves, these fries are fantastic so long as you don't plan on kissing on your first date! The portion is generous and they are good cold the next day (though my wife and I call each other out for raiding the refrigerator--there's not hiding the garlic!) The fries are served with a complement of ketchup and a few options of spiked mayo. All of them are great. 

The pizza is thin crust and many funky choices for toppings. Most recently my wife and I had a arugula, pine nut, and Gorgonzola. Reasonably priced, big portions, and never disappointing! 

As a native Clevelander, I love that much of the produce and protein are local. The back of the menu lists the seasonal ingredients and the producers. 

The only disappointment was the Sangria--just order anything else and you're set!"}
{"text":"Either our service was really bad or I just don't get it.

About 2 years ago, we stopped into this place right at opening time - no one was at the bar or the hostess stand.  So we stood inside the door for a minute, looked around, went back to the hostess stand for a few more minutes - felt really, really awkward that the door was unlocked but there was no one to be found in the whole place and left.

So, for the past 2 years, we've heard all these great things about the place and read the reviews, but thought of it as \"that one place where we felt really stupid.\"  I'm sure you all have THAT place.

But, we finally decided give it another chance. There was someone at the hostess stand! It was actually pretty cute inside.   We ordered cocktails from their specials list that were actually really great.  

The food - pizza and a burger - were underwhelming.  The service was even worse.  We finished our drinks before our food came out and weren't asked if we wanted another - or even if we wanted a water.  Nothing like being thirsty the rest of your meal. The waiter didn't come back for anything at all.  We wanted to get out of there as soon as we ate,  but he still took forever to come around and ask if we wanted the check.  It's like... um, yes, I clearly want the check since you have no intention of letting me order anything else here tonight. 

Then it was the 15 minute process once you put your card in and they don't pick it up. Which I sometimes understand when people are finishing drinks, but we clearly had nothing to finish. So annoying.  And it wasn't busy.

It should have stayed on our list of places to avoid."}
{"text":"It was my first time here on a sunday evening for dinner and drinks. When you walk in you have to specify which restaurant you want to go to because its divided into two restaurants. One side is bar cento and then the other side is the bier market. I sat at a bar for a beer and ordered regular pommes fries. You have the option to get regular or to share pommes fries. I think the regular size was more than enough for 2 people. The fries were thick cut fries and it came with different types of sauce. It was very delicious! Then for dinner I ordered the spicy chicken pizza. I am not a huge fan of thin crusted pizza but this pizza was very very delicious. Even though it was thin crust it was the perfect amount of crispiness to it and the flavors in the pizza was very delicious. The prices were reasonable and food was delicious. The bartenders were very attentive  and informed us about their popular dishes. The only compliant I have is that the atmosphere inside is very dark. I will definitely be coming back here for the food!"}
{"text":"Had the charcuterie board appetizer and bronzino entree.  Nothing too special about this place.  The food was decent, average.  Like the star ratings suggest, meh...I've experience better.

As for the service, it was okay.  Waited a while for the waiter to refill my drink and had to flag him down in the end.  My friend had some carb dish (gnioccheti maybe) and it looked like just a huge place of carbs with no color, nothing but dough."}
{"text":"went here for the first time Sunday night after visiting the Market Wine BAr.  HAd the Sunnyside Pizza and Im hooked.  a fun, laid back place. a lot of sockheads, but who cares?  great pizza done right."}
{"text":"I would probably give Bar Cento 2.5 stars but because they put the names of their entire staff on the menu, I decided to give them 3. Just kidding...I rounded up because they have Hoegaarden on tap.  ;-)

We came in for happy hour and realized we were maybe saving $2 total on our food. They advertise that they were voted best pizza by Zagat and Food Network so we decided to go with the Arugula pizza instead of the White Pizza on the happy hour menu. Note: the white pizza basically garlic bread - garlic, mozzarella, and olive oil. We were disappointed. We also got the mussels and they too were meh. The fries on the other hand were great! They have perfect seasoning and the right amount of crisp! Granted, we didn't try a big variety of the food but when you claim you've been voted best pizza, make sure it's really good and not just okay!

As for the service, our waiter was nice although he came back to \"check on us\" a little too often. When he cleared the plates, he also poured the mussel brother and unopened mussels into the shells and it went everywhere - rookie mistake.

I will definitely try it again but my first experience at Bar Cento was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the décor and our seat in the big booth right to the left of the host station. I enjoyed sharing the Pommes Frites. They are thick cut potatoes with some skin left on them and they are served with a selection of great sauces ($2 for an extra set of sauces) - 1 curry, 1 garlic, 1 red pepper and 1 ketchup. Mixing the garlic and red pepper is great! I also liked my Moscow Mule - not too gingery - and the side salad - not too much dressing. 

The service was also great. Our waitress put up with us and remained cheerful. She was attentive on refilling the waters and Mules and on clearing the plates. 

What I and others didn't like were the entrees:
-My one friend thought the Spaghetti with Asparagus tasted bland. 
-My Scallops were good, but the polenta, ramps, and pancetta they were sat in was not edible because there was so much oil - the polenta was floating. My waitress recognized this and even though I ate the 3 scallops she took the dish off the bill. 
-My one friend ordered the Strozzapreti with mushrooms, peas, Fava Beans, and pancetta. It was supposed to come in a Parmesan Broth, but the dish was bone dry. It was also such a small portion that he asked for another half portion (for which he was not charged). Hilariously, the half portion that came out was 100% different than what he was served first - it even came out in a different plate! So F for consistency. The second dish was better though. The broth was present, the portion was bigger and the flavor was better - though still too salty. 

In the future I think I'll just settle to stick with this place for snacks, maybe pizza, drinks and atmosphere and leave the entrées to somewhere else."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I dined here on New Years Eve. I had reservations and the place was packed. It looked like they had some pre-ordered multi course meals available, but we didn't partake in that and went on to order from the regular menu. 

We started with the mussles which were ok, but ever since I got back from New England, sea food in Cleveland hasn't been doing it for me. Hopefully that will wear off. I can't fault them on that. We also ordered the ravioli and a mushroom pizza. Well, they ran out of mushroom pizza, we found that out an hour after we ordered it. Oh, and the ravioli was kind of bland. 

So all in all the food was mediocre and the service was very slow. I understand that it was New Years Eve and they were very busy, but we arrived at 9:15pm and didn't get our food till about 11pm. 

This would have been a completely terrible evening, but the manager visited our table wherein he apologized and comped our entire meal. That was exactly what he should have done, and I commend him for that. I will consider going back on a less busy evening."}
{"text":"I love this place! Always open and open late. Plus their pizzas and fries are addictive. Their charcuterie board is amazing. I just told my husband that if I don't eat here in the next week, I will simply die"}
{"text":"The food and beer selection is amazing, and the service was very friendly and helpful with navigating a small, unique menu. We had the egg pizza, which was incredible and the squid gniochetti, which was also very good.

On top of the great food, the bar/restaurant is a really cool place."}
{"text":"I'm in love with BarCento!

Drinks: Love, love, love. Their house drinks are inspired by prohibition-era/speakeasy. They've got some vintage cocktails with modern twists that I love. Their French 75 is delish, and their Ginger Kid rendition of a Moscow Mule is tasty too. 

Food: SO GOOD. I love bar food and I love good food. This place has good bar food. The meat board is my favorite; their made-in-house liver mousse is TO DIE FOR especially with the bread and crackers that it comes with. The french fries are also ridiculously tasty, but I'm a sucker for anything served with a whole head of roasted garlic. I've never had anything bad here.

Service: Sometimes when it's busy, service can be a little slow. But that's understandable. If you've ever been out on W. 25th on a Saturday night, you know what I mean.

Cleanliness: The bathroom is a little nasty sometimes, but it's a bar. I went to Ohio University. I've peed in way nastier places."}
{"text":"2nd time here, 1st time actually for food. They need to do more to make the eating area warmer in the winter. By the end of my meal I was shivering. The waitress was polite but scarce and I had to flag her down a couple of time.

Now the food. Duckfat fries w/ rosemary and garlic, you really can't go wrong even though that night's batch was slightly overdone. I ordered the seasonal fish and brussel sprouts, which was delicious. My bf ordered the truffled ricotta gnocchi which was also good but the portion was so tiny that his side dish eclipsed it. Jeni's ice cream for dessert is always a plus (although tiny serving as well). I'm a fan but I think next time i'm getting a pizza."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  This alone should be the driving impetus to visiting this restaurant/bar.  we went with two other couples and i think more than one of us ordered the pizza which was outstanding.  The service, at least on that night, left much to be desired, and the back room, where we were sitting, was a bit uninspired.  overall, i think it has a  good urban vibe in the front part of the bar/restaurant and would go again.

{"text":"Look, I way appreciate that there were whole bodied anchovies on my arugula salad.  I get that that is gutsy for some folks.  I am among the people who are mildly wrecked when not served whole fat, long, silvery anchovies on any dish that could support it.  So for this and because we loved the beers you suggested (the local IPA and \"some local fruity beer\", half-remembers Chris), Bar Cento, I give you 3 stars.  

Your Belgian moules were lacking.  The mussels themselves were plump and sweet and well cooked but we all know we are ordering any sort of Moules Frites dish for the end of the meal when we get to soak our baguette, fries and then our fingers in the residual butter, wine, herbs nom nom and lick the remnants.  We tried to do this with your dish...but it tasted more like margarine than Brugge."}
{"text":"Hello management.... 
Your staff failed tonight.  The service was terrible.  
The whole purpose of coming here is that it's past last call and we can get the best  pizza in CLE!  

They closed the kitchen tonight at 1am and it was packed.  

Then the waitress added a 20% tip to our bill and called the police to come in and harass us for not giving a larger tip.  Why are the Cleveland PD in your establishment harassing patrons to give your wait staff a higher than 20% tip?  What an odd night to say the least."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite local haunt, with an amazing beer selection and great menu.  It can be hard to find a place willing to accommodating a large group, and we went there tonight with a lot of friends and our server Dan took amazing care of us!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, especially the egg pizza. Mussels in smoked tomato sauce were also done well. They carry a solid beer selection just like Bier Markt in the back. The only criticism was the service. Our server interrupted us at weird times and seemed extremely eager to push us out the door when there were open tables available. Hopefully he was just having a rough night, but either way this place is totally worth a visit for the food and beer alone."}
{"text":"What I ordered:

Beer Mussels
Lamb Meatballs

So, the only reason why I decided to check this place out was I really wanted to try Lamb Meatballs. I have no idea why, but I just wanted to taste it and I discovered that Bar Cento had it available on their menu.  My server (don't remember his name) was pretty cool. I was also looking for this pear cider but he said that it was no longer in season, he gave me a suggestion and I went for this organic apple cider. I already knew what I wanted so let's go!  I tried the Lamb Meatballs, okay...spicy and pretty good. My server walked over and stated that I should eat the mussels first because I wouldn't want to eat cold seafood. Okay, tried the mussels, by the way, first time ever eating mussels...meh, not really a fan but hey, I least I can say that I tried it.  I will say the presentation in both meals were very, very pretty...gold star!

Staff seems pretty friendly, food was okay."}
{"text":"Great food (inventive), great libations, great service, great atmosphere. That's pretty much all you can ask for, right? So happy that we happened on this place during our business trip in Cleveland. Thanks, Yelp! YUM!"}
