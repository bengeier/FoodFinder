{"text":"We had to give this a 2, because, as others have posted, the service was pretty slow and something less than friendly. We were there on a Saturday, so it wasn't super busy. The food was fine, so if you want Korean and aren't fussy on the service, it could work for you. The larger question we discussed was should ethnic restaurants honour their culture when it comes to customer service or should they reach to be more consistent with their customer base? Also, we were left wondering if Koreana BBQ's preferred customer base was indeed Koreans as opposed to a wider and more diverse customer base. Just food for thought."}
{"text":"3.5 STAR

Spicy chicken bulgogi, not so spicy but very tasty.

Kimchi stew with pork: the stew was delish, but the pork chunks were gross.

Decent cabbage Kim chi but the two radish Kim chi were better.

Good friendly service, lady sort of had a hard time understanding what we wanted but eventually figured it out.  Kudos to her and the other ladies that served us.

Nice ambiance, private rooms on one side of the restaurant.

Would totally go again!"}
{"text":"Delicious came out fast!! The kimchi was spicy the way I like it. My ramyun was delicious. I got it with egg. I recommend spicy. i loved it"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!!  Way better than dae jung geum!!  The service is awesome!  If you feel like eating ja ja myun or whang galbi (Korean BBQ).  Come to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Aesthetically it's not very pleasing its in the mall in the food court the storefront and the decor looked unplanned the counter was crowded and was not very organized.  

Prices are kinda high and as mentioned before you don't get a drink with your combo which increase the cost. Is definitely in the class of fast food the kimchi was fresh but the beef Bulgogi was a bit salty."}
{"text":"Fast food Korean?  Not on a Monday night at 7 pm. Took 17 minutes for bbq chicken, rice and a bowl of top Ramen.  Oh and I was their only customer. Save your money and time. Chicken portion was too small for the $11 platter."}
{"text":"First timers!!!  They knocked the spicy chicken bulgogi out of the park!!!

You won't leave here hungry either.  My wife had the beef and was very happy as well.

Will we be back?  Can't wait until we are in the area again"}
{"text":"Wow it was really really really bad do not waste your money or time wow never had such bad food ever."}
{"text":"I used to really like the place despite the fact that I've had to wait several times for someone to come to the register. But today has taken the cake. I walk up, the cashier is turned around not paying attention as usual. When he turns around his mouth is full of food. Now this wouldn't normally bother me as I understand people get hungry. But he sits down and starts talking with his mouth full. I'm beyond disgusted. Ruined my appetite."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their boba milk tea drinks! Sooo goood!!!! For all you boba lovers! This is a place to go! :)"}
{"text":"When I saw that a Korean BBQ place had moved in to the empty Mcdonalds store front, I was pretty excited! I would finally be able to try Korean food at a good price..Which was partially correct. They are pricey for 'fast-food', with most of their options, including a la carte, being around $7-9. I have tried their Bulgogi, with steamed vegetables and kimchi, which was all really good! The sweetness of this dish was great with the garlic and spice of the kimchi! 

I really want to try their Mandu and tempura, but they keep it under heat lamps in the front, which makes me wonder how long it has been there..but will probably try it one day ( I was watching ABC 15 and saw they got a D for their health inspection in July. It was for things like improper holding temperatures, kimchi made at home(was removed from service), thermometers, ect. BUT Most of these problems were solved on the same day)

I see now that they have added Boba tea, which I'm also really excited for, seeing as how it's hard to find without driving to the far west or Scottsdale to find!

Hopefully the busier they get, the lower prices will become, but being one of the only Korean places on the East side of Phoenix, they might not."}
{"text":"I really want to give Koreana BBQ a solid 4-5 but the best I can do is a 3 with a phantom .5.

Their food is delicious and for a non-Japanese restaurant, their Japanese dishes were tasty. I do like their side veggies. The Kimchi was just at the right level of spiciness and they serve this sweet daikon radish salad that I couldn't' get enough of. Their BBQ and hot pot combos rival the nearby Seoul Korea establishment. But their prices are a bit steep in my opinion.

But in our last visit they told me and my mom that they couldn't make any adjustments to the spices in our meals. They also misunderstood our requests and doubled our order.

But everyone gets a chance, in Koreana's case, because they're a close spot for Korean eats (shame Bow Bulgogi isn't closer :( ), I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is a small step up from Seoule Korea's down the street.  However the service here is very poor and it takes a while for the kitchen to turn out the food.  Ok when you want to just socialize but if you are hungry or have kids who need to eat right away, their level of service is in need of improvement.  Staff is friendly but they don't have enough staff and their turnover seems to be quite high.  
On the food side their BBQ meats are quite flavorful and their seafood pancake is delicious.   It seems like they may have just switched chefs as their food is off just a bit from previous visits.
For folks with allergies it isa bit dangerous due to the wait staff's translation issues.  
So the food is probably a four star but the service really pushes this down to a three at best.  If you can handle poor service but good food, then this is the place for you. 
Cheers and happy eating."}
{"text":"Personally I enjoy trying new and exciting cuisine. So I figured I'd try the Beef Bulgogi Burger, expecting the chopped up bits like any American style shredded beef brisket. But what I received was a meatloaf style formed patty full of onions, with no other flavors, covered with lettuce, tomato, pickles and basically half of an onion after already being overwhelmed by the onion packed loaf. I hardly smelled anything but my friend and sister were not pleased haha. Said the restaurant should have named the dish Hot Onion Garbage because that's pretty much what I got. Not to mention nine dollars wasted."}
{"text":"Wow! This is one of the best Korean restaurant in town!  The last time I went, the restaurant was still owned by Susan Ahn and managed by her son-in-law, Mr. Connor. But I don't see them this time. Instead, a Korean couple owned the restaurant now. But it's ok, because it was an even better experience compared to before!

The service was awesome! However they didn't come around as often as they should to fill the tea cups. but all the staff are very friendly, especially the owners (the lady was one of the servers). Their English wasn't perfect, but they are as friendly and as talkative as possible. it will come with time. 

There are many different items on the menu.  I think you can have endless combinations of them. We ordered the Seafood pancake, GREAT! the Black Goat Hot Pot, YEAH! and the Seafood Hot Pot, YUMMY! it was a lot of yummy food. The large sized hotpots serves 2-3 ppl, but actually if you order anything other than that. the hot pot will feed 3 of you to the max. we had 6 and we were super full! you will find yourself finishing all the soup in the pot because they are just that good. 
Despite all these, the one thing that stood out for me in the whole meal was their rice! yea.... rice.   I expected the rice to be regular rice. but instead. they chose to use some wild rice which is a healthier choice! I liked that. 

In the end, the 6 of us paid the bill which was only $93 + tips. yes, we left with satisfied stomach and plenty of cash left in our wallets."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. We just got yelled at by a guy who works there because he said we ordered the wrong thing. Never going back. The food wasn't that great either. The rice was crunchy. Not worth the money or hassle."}
{"text":"I was beyond excited to see a fast food Korean eatery inside a mall food court. 
I've always been a bigger fan of Korean bbq in comparison to Japanese teriyaki when it comes to casual/fast food dining. 

Sadly, this place charged an arm and a leg for basically 4 pieces of beef/bulgogi. They lay out their salad underneath the meat so they can increase their profit margin. 
I understand it's a tough business and they're in Paradise Valley, but I cannot see myself coming back as a customer when I feel cheated on my meal."}
{"text":"Team Fam came here for dinner and we ordered the BBQ For 3. Essentially, this comes with the following:
Green Salad
Soybean Soup (kind of like miso soup)
Yam Tempura
Seafood Pancake
BBQ beef, king rib, pork, spicy chicken, short ribs, mussels, prawns, and squid

The main attraction here is the BBQ and it is a massive set for three! Myfavourite parts of this dish were the spicy chicken (for its high spice level), the king rib (fall-off-the-bone essentially), and the beef (for its delicious marinade). The seafood was also pretty spot on and grilled to perfection. The sheer size of this is a challenge and our group of 3 was challenged well.

The other condiments were nice to have as a break from all the meat, and as with any Korean restaurant, there were also plenty of banchan (side dishes). These weren't as exciting but they were essential to the experience.

The Yam Tempura here deserve a special note. With their soft crisp and warm inside, the yam flavour is really distinct and the dipping sauce had a good concentration of flavour in it as well.

If I had to choose the least exciting thing here, it would be the Seafood Pancake. This would normally be the most exciting dish to have at a BBQ party, but here it was a little lacking in seafood with too much onion for my tastes. This needed a lot of sauce to go down well."}
{"text":"Nice change of pace and didn't feel conjested like kinjos.  Food was very interesting since you cook it yourself.  In the end I really prefer to chat, chat and then have the food brought to me ready!
But hey the flavours were good and you have to try new things."}
{"text":"I'm unfortunately going to lower it to 2*.  Poor service... plus the wait staff can barely speak English so it's a guessing game sometimes.  I found the prices to be steep looking at the KBBQ menu...$91 /4ppl KBBQ? or $16 for seafood pancake?!  Dolsot Bibimbap was a small portion.   Sides were still ok though. Kalbi was ok too.  What irked me is when I asked for recommendations on the menu (asking what's popular for lunch), they directed me to the KBBQ... But no one in the restaurant (which was full of Koreans) were eating KBBQ...   :(    $70 for lunch, I'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"What's happened here?  I would have given a 3.5 to 4, but there are a few things here and there that keep preventing me.

I used to go here ever so often for the Pork Bone and Potato soup, which was hearty, spicy and hot!  Side dishes of hot pickled veggies galore and some nice BBQ korean beef.  

But I find that the service and the food seems to be a bit irregular now.  I do like the food, but it's either like they changed chefs and I keep getting him alternately on vacation or at work.

It's also still a bit pricery than most of the Korean restos in town, but when they do hit their mark dead on, it's worth it.  

The staff seems to be a bit haphazard on the english comprehension, which I would have assumed was the most important part of serving an english based community.  I'll still go back here anyways, as they haven't screwed up any of my orders yet (thanks to a lot of pointing at menus), and I've never been outright disappointed ever."}
{"text":"Over prices compared to portion delivered. No drink with combos. Made the meal very pricey for one person. Ordered fried rice with boneless short ribs. It became over cooked beef with white rice disguised as fried rice. They put some kind of beef juice in it to make it look like fried rice. This place is to costly. The wait time was over 10 min."}
