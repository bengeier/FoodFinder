{"text":"Ate lunch here this weekend with a group.  We received excellent service.

I had the high desert  pasta and I plan to return as soon as possible and enjoy this dish again.   linguini, garlic, pine nuts, tomatoes, mushrooms, asiago cheese and cilantro, tossed with white wine and olive oil--I'm hooked, but now I'll never get to try all the other dishes."}
{"text":"I am 53 years old born that was born and raised in So Cal and I've eaten a lot of tacos but the tacos  at Blue Adobe Grill are the best I have ever eaten.  They were served with a bit of cabage which,originally I thought was odd but after one bite I was hooked.  I come to the Phoenix area every year for the Baseball spring training and I will now make it a point to come back here again each time I make it to Phoenix.  BTW, The service I received was top notch as well."}
{"text":"My family went there Saturday afternoon they did not get the order right first of all. When we told the server she got so excited and started to yell at us on what we ordered. After the yelling telling us what we had was our order... I told her that we ordered the chicken nuggets for my son. Not two corn tortillas with two stips of chicken. And our enchiladas were to be topped with an egg. We got our food back and the server was still being terrible to us. I wasn't going to tell her there were egg shells in our food. We just picked them out. I have picture but will not post. as far as the food... it was far from being New Mexican... just another Grengofied Mexican restaurant.  When they call there chili sauce you know that's trouble. No Spanish rice here...more like uncle ben's. However I think most people will like it. This is the last Mexican restaurant I go to in AZ sick of being disappointed."}
{"text":"Their chips and salsa are really great, different than the standard fare with a smokey flavor. I love the bean burrito, it has whole pinto beans with a lot of flavor. My husband gets the chorizo stuffed chicken dish and he loves it. One word of advice to the owners... Aesthetically the interior needs a facelift. There is visible wiring behind the wall mounted light fixtures and the giant round light on the ceiling is ugly. Just needs some freshening up. But I go there twice a month... Good food!"}
{"text":"Was the food good ... We wouldn't know. We arrived at 6:45 just in time to see a man urinating on the wall next to the restaurant. We decided to go inside anyway and were told that the wait would be 40 minutes. Over an hour passed and we watched three parties who came in after us get seated while we waited. 

The restaurant itself has almost no place to wait inside and was full of people shoulder to shoulder. So I went outside and sat on one of the two small benches provided, which had a little metal barb on it that ripped a hole in the back of my pants. When my wife confronted the hostess, she was extremely rude and lied about the amount of time she had quoted us and how long we had actually waited. She also denied that other groups had jumped the line even though we watched it happen. The food might be excellent. Certainly there were many people there, but between the urinating men, no place to wait, the pants ripping bench and the shrew of a hostess, we won't be giving it a second chance."}
{"text":"Cute place.  Food is good.  It is a bit far from my home so don't expect i will go again.  Flavor was good but shrimp were over cooked."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner, and missing New Mexico style food for many years had high expectations.  We were overjoyed with the food and the service! A midsized place, subdivided with half walls and funky decor.  Dark and homey we thought. The chips and salsa were exceptional. I had the chicken and chorizo and loved it. Cold beers too!

This place is now on our must visit list whenever we get back to Mesa."}
{"text":"Great place!  My wife and I discovered this little gem a while ago and are now proud regulars.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you are in it is warm and quaint.  The food is phenomenal, so if you like Southwestern food, this is the place to be.

Love it, love it, love it!!!!"}
{"text":"I am using my Groupon for this place and its not a great start. We were left standing at the  front door for a good 5 minutes. My pet peeve is that they see u standing there but wont say anything!!! WTH Come on people a simple we'll be right you goes a long way. I also checked on Yelp to get free guacamole which was cool but it was kinda bland, no flavor.  I got the carne adovada which came with beans and rice. Only the rice was flavorful. My yobo had the double stack chicken enchiladas (red sauce) with  the fried egg. His was good but the beans got no taste to them.  The most important  question is......Would I come back??? NO thanks I'll pass"}
{"text":"My favorite chicken tacos ever.  Shredded white meat, shredded cabbage, a little bit of a creamy sauce, and soft corn tortillas make the tacos outstanding.  Sad they no longer make the beef tenderloin burrito--that was also a winner."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment. Smells great with their pecan wood cooking. I tried the Adobe asada and it was excellent. Friends had triple enchilad and it was amazing."}
{"text":"The food and drinks and service were awesome. The margaritas are excellent. I think it is the best Mesa has to offer"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place years ago, and finally found out what I've been missing out on! Oh my delicious, we loved this place. The chips and salsa were a great start. All very flavorful and fresh, that's always a good start. We all ordered a dish that included the Adovado...amazing! Lots of other things on the menu to try, we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I loved my meal and drink. I had a tasty salad and veev acai cocktail. The chips and salsa were wonderful as well."}
{"text":"We had GREAT service. We were dining with our toddler who can be kind of terrorizing sometimes and the server was just so nice and accommodating to us.

The food was just alright. I got the chimichanga and my husband got the stacked enchiladas. They were okay but nothing special. I also got a margarita and was disappointed in it. I'm used to mexican restaurants having pretty strong margaritas and this one just tasted like pure sugar."}
{"text":"Triple stack enchiladas were next level awesome.  Small yet very cool bar.  Great service."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner tonight, outstanding service by staff, especially Adam. Daily dinner special is always a great choice-ancho chili salmon tonight."}
{"text":"I discovered this place about 4 years ago just by luck.  It was my girlfriends birthday and we were visiting my parents in mesa so I Googled \"Best restaurants in mesa\" and this place was ranked #2 overall at the time.  

I live in Montana but every time I come down here to visit,  I make it a point to come here 2-3 times for lunch or dinner if possible.  

They have some of the best Margaritas I've ever had! They make their own Margarita mix which is awesome.  I hate when Margarita mix is tart and sour and there's is so far from that.  Try the house Margarita for $4 during happy hour which is daily from 3:00-6:30. 

I typically order the Lobster tamales, the Carne adovada (which is pork tenderloin simmered in Mexican spices), or the stacked enchiladas.  All 3 are to die for!  I would also recommend the ancho-chile salmon. They also have daily specials which are a great deal for the money. 

All in all,  one of my favorite restaurants. Friendly staff, and great ambiance. Don't judge the place from the outside.  It's truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Amazing place..Lobster dip is a MUST! Wash it all down with a prickly pear margarita."}
{"text":"Im from Taos, New Mexico and this place has some great food.

Start with a bowl of the Red Pork Posole! This stuff is like tia makes it. Lime, cabbage, great chili paste, AMAZING!

We get the red and green carne adovada enchiladas. The pork just falls apart it's so well done. 

The service is decent but the food portions and taste is Muy Bueno!"}
{"text":"Blue Adobe has one of my all time favorite dishes anywhere.  Their carne adovada is fantastic.  I've tried it other places and nobody compares.  The chipolte salsa is also one of my favorites."}
{"text":"First of all- service was good. Attentive staff, neatly dressed, checked on us often. Now the food- this is NOT New Mexico food. Tried the chile relleno  with red chile. Folks, you don't add chicken broth to red chile to make it salty. Yuck. The relleno was covered with Panko bread crumbs- ok, slightly different but then they fried the heck out of it so you end up with a dark blob that had red, salty sauce on the side. I think we can all agree that even if the blanket of egg mixture that tradition  says should envelope a relleno isn't there, you should at least make certain that you can tell it's a chile (Pasilla) under all that crunchy (CRUNCHY!) coating. I'll skip the chicken taco -as you should- and move to my companions smoked pork tamale. Don't, just don't. The tamale is almost black as if that is some indication it's been smoked. But the reality is that the masa is made with beef broth and the pork in the tamale is smoked.  Can you say overkill? This makes for salty masa that tastes like beef barley soup with just a lick of smoke in the pork.. Don't think the adovada will do- another bit of 'magic' they hope to pull off by soaking the meat in broth. Folks that doesn't make it tasty- just salty and it's for certain you'll guess it's meat if you had a taste test. Disappointing doesn't cover it, I feel lied to and had to share. Will I try it again? Doubtful when there are other restaurants that hold true to New Mexico cuisine."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cheese Crisp appetizer and it was anything but appetizing.  It was not even on a tortilla but on a thin pizza crust.  There was barely any cheese on it.  Supposedly, this was an old recipe--definitely not."}
{"text":"Fast, tasty, decent prices, and a fun local feel.  Will be back...glad to have found this neighborhood New Mexican spot.  Stacked enchiladas are tasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place but it is not for the faint hearted. If you do not enjoy spicy foods, I am not sure there will be much for you to eat. But if you can handle the heat you need to go!

Everything is quality. I always get my enchiladas or rellenos Christmas style and with the pecan grilled shrimp.

However, the salsa is not my favorite (more of a chunky salsa girl) and the chips are sometimes too heavily salted."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful here!!  We've enjoyed it for years!!  The only bad thing about Blue Adobe is that they do not answer their phone.  Numerous times I have called in to made a reservation and the phone just rings and rings.  The service is also not what it use to be.  Not sure if it is under new management or not.  The food is still great if you can over look the other management/services issues."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food!  It's a long drive for us, but worth every mile!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant and  worth the drive.  Excellent service and outstanding food.  There green chili and other sauces are wonderful.  The food quality is as it should be.  We had the Chimi and the meatloaf and split them, both outstanding."}
{"text":"The place has the feeling of a funeral home, they must take the good out of a can, and the price is way too much, never to return!"}
{"text":"Lunch was great. Excellent service and food. Shrimp tacos and beef rellenos very tasty. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I am writting this review in large part because of he many negative reviews from one group of 30 who went there. First, the manager seems to have been at fault, if you notice an apology from the blue adobe grill appears under one of the reviews. Secondly... did the person making the reservations ever go there before hand? It is a small restaurant, it seats at most 60 people and the largest group it is likely to be able to handle in all honesty would be about fifteen. The food is excellent, the service generally good. My Only complaint so far is that thier Calimari and crab cakes are over-priced (still good quality). everything else is extremly good. It would be a good idea for anyone setting up a large dinner party to visit the restaurant in question if possible"}
{"text":"Stopped by at about 5pm-6pm on a Saturday, wasn't too busy, had two cheese enchiladas, was pretty good. Also had a killer margarita on happy hour for $4, wasn't too bad at all, was pretty good actually. The food was pretty good, their salsa is pretty odd imo, they had wood-burned flavored salsa that added to the food, but then again was not your everyday salsa that you'd expect. Kind of hit and miss on the salsa.

Other than that, the cheese enchiladas were pretty darn good. They kept refilling the water cups pretty fast and the waitress was really good at keeping up tabs with us. 

Overall a pretty good Mexican food experience."}
{"text":"Had to have my car repaired nearby and yelped this place.  Had the stacked enchiladas with carne adovada and it was very very good.  Great find for me and looks like others have enjoyed their food too."}
{"text":"This is a poorly managed establishment with decent food. When I arrived, they claimed we didn't have a reservation. After showing them my phone log, showing we had spoken a week earlier to make the reservation, we were seated after a 20min wait. When we tried to use our Groupon to pay they first said it was expired (it doesn't expire until mid march) then changed their tune claiming they didn't even sell them (despite being the establishment shown on the Groupon). False advertising is a pet peeve of mine. You can get better food elsewhere without having to deal with rude and lying managers."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food. 
We were in Albuquerque a couple days ago and had some of the worst New Mexican food we have ever had. Who would have thought we would get here and have some of the best. 
Great atmosphere. Decor was very inviting. Very good service, food was delivered in a reasonable time. 
We would definitely eat here more if we lived in town."}
{"text":"Great food. We go here often.  The help is very accommodating to modify the menu to suit your needs. We went for brunch Sunday (1st time) and the eggs Benedict was fantastic especially with potato pancakes underneath. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've taken customers here and its definitely a favorite of ours when we feel like eating upscale.  Its got a nice cozy dining area with TVs and nice dimly lit area.  I'm always struck by the smell of the wood burning grill as soon as I walk in the restaurant and that must be my favorite thing."}
{"text":"I lived in Albuquerque, NM for 20 years. Great food and I really miss it. Found this restaurant online and saw all of the great reviews. Thought I had found the one. Unfortunately NOT. If this restaurant were in Albuquerque, it would go out of business within 2 months. I was very disappointed . Salsa was so bland and I would have not even considered it mild. They brought me the \"hotter\" salsa. It may have been mild. I ordered the carne adovada enchiladas with red chile. Couldn't even taste the red chile. Anyway, I hate to give bad reviews but when I find a restaurant that says they are one thing, and they are not, I have to be very honest. The many people that go there must have never eaten New Mexican food in New Mexico. Sorry, but I would never go back or recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place.  The food, the service are top notch.

The food is tremendous.  Everything from their killer homemade salsa and guac to the rellenos, pecan wood grilled shrimp and stacked enchiladas (the adovada is divine) is delicious.  Hard to go wrong.  The margaritas rock.  And believe it or not, their creme brulee is the best I've had outside of France.

I do not say this lightly.  I was in the restaurant business myself for many years, and love to eat out.  Blue Adobe is my favorite restaurant in this country.  It's a good thing I have relatives in Phoenix (I live in CA), as I would have to make up an excuse to travel here just to come to this restaurant.  In fact, the last time I was in, I overheard another patron say that he has been to over 100 countries, and this is his favorite restaurant of all.

Don't pay attention to the one-star \"group of 30\" people.  Anyone who calls day-of to inform of (not request) a mass influx deserves what they get.  That kind of event needs much greater lead time, and it just goes to show how thoughtless and self-important some restaurant goers can be.  Get a clue, people.  Diana bends over backward every time my family comes to visit.  I've only ever had friendly, hard working service each time there, perhaps because we are unassuming, non-demanding, realistic people.

Love you, Blue Adobe!  Wish I had you closer to me!"}
{"text":"This is NOT mexican. It is New Mexican style food which has a distinctly different flavor than Mexican or Tex-Mex. In short, this place is amazing. Very tasty and unique flavors that you don't really find anywhere else. Do make a reservation because the place is always packed. Pass on the margarita because they're too damn sweet."}
{"text":"We have tried several things on the menu, and everything was good--especially the salsa.  My favorite is the seafood enchiladas!  I hope to return soon.  I agree that the interior is laid-back, but I do not consider that a detriment.  And as close as it is to the Mesa PD headquarters and the Mesa Municipal Court, I don't think you have to worry about the area of town."}
{"text":"This place serves great food. Unique salsa! The Tucamcari is my favorite. They use pecan wood for grilling. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service and reasonable prices.  This place is on par with Richardson's but less expensive and easier to get a table.  Quickly becoming by favorite New Mexican restaurant in AZ."}
{"text":"Blue Adobe Grille has excellent food.  The chips and salsa are free and are by far the best chips and salsa in the valley.  The salsa is smokey and full of flavor.  It is hot but not so hot you cannot continue to eat.  The drinks are over priced for what is served.  I was dissapointed with my skinny marg.  I think the only reason it was \"skinny\" was the fact that it is half the size as the normal margarita.  SoSad....

The menu has a lot of variety and the specials are always good picks.  I usually eat the special that is on the chalk board because I know that it will be fresh and it comes out quick.

Visit Blue Adobe Grille for dinner.  Go hungry."}
{"text":"We frequent this place, as it is down the street from our business, and it's always amazingly good. I placed a to-go order, it was waiting for me right on time. I had a co-worker call and order last minute while I was picking up. While I was waiting for the additional food, the manager (I assume) made sure I had a complimentary drink, along with chips and salsa. She also rushed my additional order, and I was out the door ASAP. Excellent service, and delicious food. Perfect!"}
{"text":"The food here is scrumptious, with an emphasis on seafood, south-of-the-border spiciness and some special touches from the chef. I highly recommend the green chile lobster dip as an appetizer--truly my favorite dip ever (the fresh fried flour tortilla chips don't hurt.) From there, it doesn't seem you can go wrong. Plenty of entrées to choose from, running the gamut from burgers to enchiladas to various fish. A couple of veg options. The green salsa is pitch-perfect. There are specials on the board when you walk in. I've always finished just full enough to not want dessert (though I could say I perpetually want sopapillas) but not needing to take home leftovers.

From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look very promising, with its shabby exterior, location next to a paint-ball club on a ghetto stretch of Country Club Road (though which part of this road isn't ghetto?). Inside, the ambiance changes to comfortable, well-lit and nicely decorated. Enter and it will be worth your while. (Only caution is to open both left and right taps at bathroom sink or risk getting scalded)

I've gone to this location twice and haven't ever had trouble getting seating for two. Likewise I've enjoyed good service. It seems there have been multiple reservation fiascos because they haven't figured out how to handle larger crowds, which is a pity. I have yet to try their Scottsdale location but will report on it soon."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp and the Marriott hotel recommended it.   Everything was great..... Good service , good drinks and great food !   You can't go wrong enjoying a meal here."}
{"text":"I see a lot of the reviews are about service.  I can't speak to those same experiences, as I've always received good service.  Then again it has always been just my wife and I.  It seems the poor service has been with larger crowds.

Anyway, the food is beyond good.  This is New Mexican, not Mexican...so if you are expecting Jalisco style food -- go elsewhere.  This is not that.

To me, this place has the best Carne Adovada I've ever had.  Ever.  It is so tender and delicious I always eat too much.  The Chile Relleno is great as well (I make sure to add some tenderloin in there like it used to be in the old menu).

The rice/beans aren't the best to me, but that's not why I go.  The chips and salsa (not free) are delicious as well...salsa is really good.

We don't get here as often as I'd like, but I'm a huge fan of the food.  Too bad others have had poor service experiences."}
{"text":"A great find.  One of our new favorites, the Santa Fe style food here is some of the best to be found in the valley.  The atmosphere inside is quite charming and our server was attentive and friendly.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We were really impressed with our dinner and the service.  We had the Carne Adovada and the Rellenos - both blew us away because the flavors were well balanced, the meats were cooked appropriately and the sides were delicious.

We are from the Twin Cities (Minnesota) and appreciate great Mexican when we can find it.  Highly recommended and we will return next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place many times and have thought about going.  We used a Groupon last night and it was wonderful!!  Totally homemade dinners.  My husband had the Chorizo stuffed chicken and I had the Blue Crab enchiladas. We shared a carafe of Prickley Pear margaritas.  We loved everything we had and will return sooner than later!!
Oh, and the desserts were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Our go to when we are in Mesa. Lots of great flavors on one plate. Steaks are just the right size, wonderfully done,  potatoes piped onto a half green chile, fresh veggies perfectly sautéed in a little wine. $18-19.95, awesome. Mexican style items (Lobster Tamale etc.) Excellent, moderately priced and usually too much to eat. (Lots of creative, spicy hot stuff, not my style but who ever I'm with loves it) Daily specials are regular menu items priced crazy low. Attentive, excellent service from really pleasant servers. 

If I didn't live in Chicago this would be a once a week stop!"}
{"text":"Great little place with excellent food and service. 

They use an ancho chile for some of their sauces and its just divine. My boyfriend and I typically go here after catching a few Spring Training Cubs games (there's only so many Old Style beers and hotdogs one can take-lol!) and its usually pretty busy. We almost always split two dishes, because we like variety and are always satisfied. 

Our \"go to\" dishes we split are the chile rellenos and/or The Land of Enchantment plate. 

Of course, you have to have a Prickly Pear margarita here too. A trip to the Southwest isn't complete without it! :)"}
{"text":"This place was a flop. Was visiting a friend in Chandler and found this place on mobile Yelp. Had 68-something reviews and 4/5 stars which almost always means it will be a good place. Boy I was wrong this time.

I hate those lengthy reviews talking about unimportant things so I'll stick to the main point. The restaurant itself was clean and you can sit down comfortably.

The waiter highly recommended the pork avodovo plate, which is pork that is served doused with either a green or red sauce with beans and rice on the side. I cannot take spicy food, and the waiter insisted the red version isn't spicy. My friend ordered the green version since he DID want spice.

Ended up being the other way around...the red-sauce was oil-based and it was SPICY. My friend's green one was not spicy at all, and that was a more water-based sauce. He cleaned his plate and I barely touched mine. The waiter offerred to bring something else but I refused, barely having eaten any of it. I was put off by the waiter's \"recommendations,\" and therefore assumed everything else was going to be ridiculously spicy. Plus, I shouldn't have to wait and then be delayed from leaving there for another 45 mins. I did tell him it was too spicy for me to eat and I didn't like it. He still charged me for it! I felt like I was robbed...I hate paying for something and then getting NOTHING. And I hate when restaurant waiters make you feel like you are obligated to like something when you really don't...and if you don't, they tend to argue with you about your dislikes. Same thing happened here. I didn't want to make a scene here either regarding the check, so I left hungry and paid for a second dinner at a fast food joint afterwards. What a waste.

I don't see why this place got rave reviews...the food came out in minutes and was as if it were just sitting ready reheated in the back kitchen.

My friend ordered the creme brulee for dessert and that was not good at all...served at the extreme bottom of a large soup bowl and was really thin and had a metallic taste...yuck. There are tons better places in this city.

Would so NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My son and I were looking for some authentic Mexican food during our visit to the Phoenix area. We found Blue Adobe on Yelp and decided to give it a try.
I would recommend you do the same.
The smell from their wood burning ovens started the meal off right. I walked in and said, what ever that smell is I want it!
We ate at the bar and Lori our bartender made my son and I feel like we were locals. My son had their famous Bleu Adobe Burger. He said it was the best burger he's ever had.
I decided to try their Friday night special.It was their seafood enchilada. I usually put lots of hot peppers on my food but the flavor and smell was so incredible I didn't want to ruin it.

Next time we visit Mesa I'll defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. Service was slow, which is forgivable in a small establishment. But then the food came out. It was hot, looked delicious... so we dig in. The chipotle was so strong that the food was essentially bitter. Perhaps just my personal palette, but my girlfriend didn't enjoy her Chimi either, she said it was really greasy. The Creme Brule was good though. Not horrible, but we didn't like the food. Pity, it's a cute place."}
{"text":"I visited Blue Adobe Grille after Browsing local Mexican restaurants with decent reviews.  Although this place was not a complete nightmare I ultimately  left extremely disappointed and will never return again.  I will start with the positive and with the negative. 

1.) ATMOSPHERE-(5/5) The decor and atmosphere are great bringing out a culture rich ambiance. 
2.) SERVICE-(4/5) The Hostess and Server were prompt and attentive to refills, The server took time with to go over the menu with me and admitted when she didn't know something. My Food contained items that I asked to be left out. It's hard to say if it was her fault or the chefs. Although, I still would of appreciated it if she  would of checked with us after Immediately delivered the food and not 15 minutes later.  
3.) SIDE-FOOD & BEVERAGES-(3/5)  They serve untraditional  jalapeño salsa that did not taste bad Though I prefer normal salsa. Margaritas were pretty conventional and they only serve coke products but syrup and carbonation were mixed to the correct amount.
4.) PRICE/QUANTITY/-(2/5) Price was slightly above average  and did not match the expected quantity of  chicken Quesadillas I received. It seemed more like an appetizer then a meal and the sides came in super tiny cups. 
5.) MENUE/FLEXABILITY-(2/5) The nice thing about their menu is it's diversity the bad side of that is that there is not much of a selection for Mexican food. As far as flexibility They do not allow much as far as substitution for Toppings, sauces and sides. If it  is something they Allow you to substitute there will be an up-charge. 
6.)WAIT-TIME-(1/5) We had a total party of 3 and  I believe at the minimum it took them 45 minutes to get our food out. The place was not crowded and we ordered quesadillas which is not something that takes long to cook. 
7.)FOOD-(1-5) Here is the Biggest Reason why i had a hard time even giving this Place 2 stars. The Bristly Chicken In the small quantity of Quesadillas I recieved consisted of almost just FAT. Not only that but it was UNDERCOOKED as well.  My other family members  who ordered the samething  also had the same problem.  I had Already Waited almost an hour for my meal So I didn't send it back."}
{"text":"My grandson and I visited for the first time on 3/17/16 at 10 minutes before their 9 pm closing. We were a little worried we might get rushed due to our late/no reservation. Not so. Shawn, our server was very gracious and attentive throughout the meal. What a delight this whole experience was. Each and everything we ordered was delicious. From the chips and salsa, pork posole and side salad to the tamales, relleno, pinto beans and BBQ chicken pizza. We will most definitely be back. I will recommend this restaurant..."}
{"text":"I've had their dinner numerous times & have always enjoyed it, but this is the first time I've had their breakfast,  and I've got to say..... DAMN! I absolutely loved it! I had the green pork & eggs & my husband had the green chilli biscuits & gravy. Both were phenomenal! They have a Benedict that looks great. We will definitely go back. If you like spicy New Mexican breakfast, you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Always a good meal when I'm visiting Phoenix!  The chicken Chimi is great soft or fried, and their salsa has a fantastic smoky flavor that I haven't experienced anywhere else.  As others have said, this is *not* traditional Mexican food, and in this case, that's a GOOD thing!"}
{"text":"The Taos Combo was huge.  I usually don't prefer enchiladas, because they just have meat inside.  Well, I'm a fan of their shrimp enchilada.  It has a nice texture and pleasant flavor.  The tamale was enormous, with meat spilling out.  And the relleno was tastier than a typical relleno with a cheese filling.  The creme brulee had good taste.  The crust didn't shatter like I expected, perhaps it was a touch too thick.  Overall, a very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"The queso Blanco was great! That's all. We had chorizo stuffed chicken and could barely cut it with a knife. We also had the house margarita and it was way watered down. I have had MUCH better Mexican food. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We came for the creme brûlée tonight so my wife could get a tasty treat on her birthday...It was so good we ordered two!! 

The staff was on top of things and the bartender had a ball with our little 2 year old! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Am I blue? Only in a good way...  as in the BLUE ADOBE GRILLE variety, baby! This is one of those restaurants that serves REAL southwestern (New Mexico style) cuisine... not some chain themed thang. Naw, this is the real deal.

I have only visited the Mesa location, and while its not much from the outside, its got everything you need on the inside. Like the Prickly Pear Margarita for starters -- sweet and refreshing on a hot summer evening. I had the Tango something or other... which is not currently shown on their website menu. It included a mushroom enchilada that was to die for, as well as some fresh zucchini and carrots julienned and I believe a polenta/seafood thang which was scrumptious. Their salsa is down-right addictive!

Service is excellent. I will be back without a doubt. Website and menu design needs help.

{"text":"Tried this place the other night and we were very impressed. The chips and salsa were delish. Salsa has a bit of a kick which we liked. The spoon rellenos were the best rellenos I have ever had. My friend thought her double enchiladas were excellent. We had no room for dessert and took home half our meals"}
{"text":"I heard of this place word of mouth. I decided to go. As i pulled up, i thought it looked like a dump. I was already there, so i might as well go inside. Complete game changer. Its done nicely.  The food was amazing and well proportioned for the money. Its not expensive, its about average.  I like that the waiters are all in a tip pool, so they help each other out. When you get service like that, you wont be waiting for your waiter to get help. Its a great place, great environment, and great food. Finally, i have a true fall back place if i cant think of anywhere else to go!"}
{"text":"Was going to the Mesa arts center for a concert and needed somewhere to eat first and found this on Yelp.  Thanks Yelpers !  I would never have gone in without your recommendations !  Looks a bit dodgy from the outside, but really cosy on the inside.  We were seated at the bar as the place was so busy - a great sign.  Our waitress was awesome and gave us some great recommendations. I had mushroom and beef chimis in a mushroom sauce - it was unbelievable.  My partner had fish tacos.  We will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"We've been to Blue Adobe 4 times and each time was great!!  So far we've loved every item that we've had.  And we've ordered different items each time.  Last night the staff was excellent even though it got busy half way through our dinner.  We ate at the bar which has a hammered copper top (We really like it).  I will say the best place to eat in the restaurant is at the bar.  There are usually only 2 of us and we can be seated immediately.  Be aware that each time we've gone they have been busy which says a lot about the food, which I reiterate, is wonderful.  Don't expect traditional Mexican from here.  The menu is very creative.  Vicki the owner was charming and our bartender Laurie was great!  We definately recommend Blue Adobe and will have future fun times there."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Mesa, The Blue Adobe Grill is top on our list of places to eat!  Everything on the menu is OUTSTANDING!  Service starts with tri-colored chips served with one of the tastiest salsa that I have ever had.  Order the Cruz Caddy Margarita - served by the glass, 1/2 carafe, or my favorite - the full carafe!  As for the menu, it is extensive and so hard just to choose ONE item!  My usual choice is the green chili adovada triple stacked enchilada smothered with green chili sauce and of course, topped with a fried egg!  OMG!  Really, you must try this place - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Visited Blue Adobe Grill for the first time a couple of weekends ago and I'm glad I did! It has been on my list if places to visit since I've moved to the Valley, but I'm not in Mesa often and to be honest, I was a little uncertain on what to expect given the nondescript exterior and location. I'm glad that didn't stop me this time!

Our server was very nice and made us feel welcome.  When we told him we were from New Mexico, he told us lots of folks from NM like their food.  We were do excited to see familiar things like \"red and green chile\" or \"christmas.\"  The salsa and chips that came out at the beginning of the meal were complimentary and yummy.  I had a hard time deciding what to get because the menu was a little different than the average mexican or new mexican restaurant...they seemed a little more \"gourmet\" in their dishes.  My sis in law went with the green chile chicken enchiladas and I went with the chile rellenos.  Our meals came out promptly and looked awesome! My sister in law's first few words when biting into her enchiladas were \"Mmmm....green chile....wow....look at all these big chunks of chicken...don't think I've seen enchiladas served with that much chicken before!\" and her meal ended with \"Hmm....I want to eat it all because it is sooooooooo good, but I'm getting full! I should save some for my hubby, but...it's so good....\" She finally relented and portioned off a bit for her husband.  ;) 

I had just run a half marathon, so although I was starving, I filled up too quickly and only ate a few bites.  My dish included two huge chile rellenos encrusted with panko, stuffed with chorizo, cheese and beef (they said filet, but who knows...either way it was delish!) and it was divine.  I had mine served \"christmas\" style with both red and green chile on top.  Although the red chile wasn't like our traditional NM red chile (my sis in law and I both agreed that it had a more \"smoky\" flavor than our traditional chile), it was delicious and different and I loved it!  I took the leftovers home and they heated up beautifully in the oven and I was able to enjoy my meal a second time when my appetite returned.  

If you're looking for something a little different than your average 'mexican' restuarant, definitely check this place out.  If you're content and satisfied with the mexican chain restaurants...don't bother!  Leave this gem to the rest of us who will appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food here. If you want to try something unique and tasty, definitely come to Blue Adobe Grille. Not sure how they make the Blue Adobe Burger so damn delicious, but that is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Food was great.  I had chicken tacos.  The rice and beans were awesome.  My complaint is about the service.  I was there by myself at lunch and ate the bar.  The bartender was less was friendly and seemed to be more interested in talking with a friend at the bar then giving good service.  Excellent food, questionable service."}
{"text":"**Review is meant for the vegetarians in your group**

Food was tasty but I would not recommend.  

Restaurant is clearly popular with the local crowd, and they do not claim to be veg-friendly, so I cannot judge them too harshly.  However, I was disappointed that our server had little menu knowledge and had to inquire with the cooks about meat stock (she was very friendly and did her best, but it was clear that they don't get this question often, just not that sort of clientele).  Was more disappointed that pretty much everything we wanted to order contained pork, including both the red and green sauces.  Guac was ok but not overly flavorful.  

Overall, I've been to other Mex/New Mex restaurants where the servers are quick to warn you about ingredients and are overall more veg-friendly."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time, loved it.  Great service, reasonable prices and awesome food."}
{"text":"This was the worst authentic Mexican food I have ever tasted! The salsa was nasty couldn't get past it! Will never go again"}
{"text":"We could eat every meal here! The Carne Adovada is to die for, chile relleno is really flavorful, margaritas are delish, and the delicately crispy chips and yummy salsa are soooo good. We are from San Diego and just visiting but so glad we found this place. We couldn't even finish our 2 item orders as the portions were quite large. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"This place suck! And stinky! Smells like sewage !"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  We went last night for dinner to satisy our mexican craving.  Started with chips, salsa, and queso bean dip-delicious!  After filling up on chips we split the Land of Enchanment.  Everthing on the plate was more delicious than the next.  The tenderloin melts in your mouth, the shrimp grilled to perfection and the veggies sauteed but still fresh and crisp.  The enchilada had the perfect amount of heat without being overwhelming.  We eneded with a creme brulee that was so good you didn't even feel guilty eating it.  The staff was friendly and welcoming.  This restaurant far exceeds the others in the area and is worth driving out of the to get to.  Will definetely be added to my favorites list."}
{"text":"Loved it.  I put together a little sampler plate for my first visit.  The Steak Chilli Rellno and the Lobster Tamale I think were my favorite.  The posole was also quite good.
I thought it was great.  I now haw found my favorite Mexican food gem in Arizona."}
{"text":"Excellent all the way around. Carne Adovada (both Green and Red Chile) was outstanding. Pinto beans and rice were just like I had growing up in S New Mexico. Prices were very reasonable for the quality and quantity. Tacked on a signature salad for 2.95. You gotta try it out, you'll love it! I might eat there again tomorrow night."}
{"text":"Solid if unspectacular little joint. The daily deals are worth coming in for if you're in the mood for a sit down place at a good price. Terrible guac, skip right to your meal or enjoy the chips and salsa. Good sized portions, you won't leave this place hungry."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely fantastic.  

1) not a touristy place, we found it due to great reviews on yelp.
2) the size is perfect, not too small / not too big (Goldie and the 3 Bears would approve )
3) the Margarita was perfect!! 
4) the food was amazing and plated perfectly 

I highly recommend .. you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I almost hate to write this as it will become even more crowded, but if I want a unique food experience, I love to come here.  The outside is misleading and the inside is cozy.  I would recommend reservations as it gets packed!  I have never had a bad meal....nor drink here!"}
{"text":"The Blue Adobe Grill is a very popular place for New Mexican cuisine in the East Valley.  The plates are very well prepared and appealing to the eye, not to mention delicious!  I highly recommend making reservations as the Saturday night we went got very busy into the dinner hours."}
{"text":"We stopped here because it was on our way out of town. We were very surprised at the friendly service and the good food. It seems very authentic New Mexican. The salsa was particularly good. 
We had the portabello enchiladas and chile relleno and would order the same thing again. Definitely worth another stop."}
{"text":"great chips and salsa, had the lobster tamale gf had the salmon something or other.  everything was tasty and spicy. great service"}
{"text":"We have gone here for years and never had a bad experience. The chips and salsa are uniquely flavored and delicious, the corn chowder is great on a rare cool evening, but the lazy tacos are to die for. The raspberry cheesecake is also worth saving room for. 
It is always crowded but we don't mind. It is one of those places that is worth waiting 20-30 minutes for a seat because the food and service is just that good. 
The surrounding area is going downhill but I think this gem will always do well."}
{"text":"First things first The Blue Adobe Grille is a New Mexican food joint not to be confused with Mexican food- totally different! I love both, but there is something about the heavy influence of ancho & green chili that drives me back again and again! I have been multiple times and yet to a bad experience, even when I had a bad experience! Confused? Let me clear air-
   Headed out on the town one evening with wifey, we decide to start the night @ Blue Adobe. We started off with a few drinks and then placed our order, few more drinks down the hatch. The waitress walks by and tells us just about 5 mins left, cool no prob! 5 mins more she comes by apologizes and tells us more mins, um ok. Next thing you know, there's a loud argument in the kitchen and the owner (who has been bussing tables, playing hostess, & well just all out helping her staff) comes to the table and tells us the cooks lost our order, What???? She then apologizes and tells us our plates are next and tells us dinner is on her. Ok that's cool, we have all been there and any place with tact will do that, but we've been drinking and as we all know that adds up quick especially with shots! So when we get the bill, she had taken care of everything, I was shocked, she had come back by several times to apologize and thank us for coming in. That was the only bad experience we've had and it still turned out awesome! A owner that cares about the customer+ class + great food = a 5 star great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Went there with my wife while we were on vacation and it seemed like it was in a sketchy part of town, but it ended up being the highlight of our trip! The salsa for the chips was uniquely incredible, our server was top notch. He was very knowledgeable about the entire menu and offered good insight on our meals. I had a Cadillac margarita and got a little tipsy before ordering the lobster tamales. The tamales were phenomenal and my wife's meal was equally as enjoyable. We wish that we had room for dessert as that looked just as good as our meals. I highly HIGHLY suggest going to Blue Adobe...you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food.  Excellent bar.  Chicken quesadilla is everything you want in a tasty take on a classic.  Crab cakes had a little spicy bite to them, which was well recieved and much appreciated.  Gorgeous table covering helped set the place apart from ordinary.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Wow. Great place, with amazing food. Good choices and very yummy. I had chorizo stuffed chicken breasts, hubs had stacked enchiladas, and our friends had the leftover meatloaf, wow. Such good food. I can see why it's rated a top place for great food! 
We had a server though that messed up quite a few things though. Margaritas were to be with no salt, they came with salt. Then he disappeared...we saw all other staff, he was mia for about 10 minutes.  We ordered, he got my friends food wrong.  And wasn't the slightest bit sorry. It was weird, he wasn't even paying attention.  We'll be back, i just hope we get a more lively, responsive waiter."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and frequent this restaurant. Normally the food is consistent and excellent. Took my wife for breakfast brunch. She ordered the biscuits and gravy because the menu read \"fluffy green chilli and cheddar biscuits.\" The biscuits were plain store bought Pilsbury Grands. Either the menu is written incorrectly or they were out of what was listed. The waiter said they were hand made. As a professional baker, we say \"NOPE\"."}
{"text":"Such a delicious restaurant for great southwestern food. Beautiful decor and a great place to bring people from out of town."}
{"text":"I was in from Los Angeles with my wife to see her in-laws. We checked reviews online and while this restaurant had a few mixed reviews, we checked it out. I consider myself fairly well-versed in Mexican food, and this place did not disappoint. The pecan wood they use to cook many of their dishes really adds great flavor, and although we all ordered different dishes, everyone was happy. In particular, the pork was flavorful and spicy, and the salsa was smokey with a hint of fruit. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"In the mood for Mexican food near our hotel and visited this weekend while in town for spring baseball.
We were impressed. 
Started with Green Chile Lobster appetizer which set the stage nicely.  
My wife had the Cruz Kitchen which includes Tenderloin Relleno and Smoked Pork Tamale. She described it as tasty but somewhat salty. 
I opted for Santa Café  Choose Three option and got the Smoked Pork Tamale, Carne Adovada and Shredded Beef Taco which were all quite good. 
Service was reasonable.
As with most reviews I read, I would go back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had early dinner last night.  Had a salmon wrap, cooked just I requested, and it was excellent.  Daughter just had salad with grilled chicken, which she said was delicious!  Salsa was fire roasted with a little heat which was to die for.  All this and great service.  Will definitely come back with hubby."}
{"text":"Bummer dinner x 2! Chicken breast was like a hockey puck - tough and dry. Shrimp quesadilla was appetizer size @ full dinner price. This place must have changed hands. Never go on Sunday. There wasn't even a hostess. I'll give it another try but alone. I wouldn't subject anyone I know to this."}
{"text":"I guess sauce from a can, some canned black beans, corn from a can slapped on a grill for a bit passes as good Mexican food. The place was dirty, in in the way that the staff doesn't clean up at night but in the fact that management rather paint over things rather than clean it properly, and dirt and grime worked in the leather cushions of the seats. It's just older and management does want to close it for a week to have everything cleaned well."}
{"text":"Outstanding and unique New Mexican cuisine. Loved the Chip Chop salad with pulled pork. Solid service too!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but not fantastic. Server seemed frustrated that the 3 families wanted to pay separately. But overall I'm glad we went."}
{"text":"We received a gift certificate to go here, and the server (travis) knew we had enough to cover the bill prior to ordering. He not only provided us exceptional service, but also was one of the best servers we have ever had (and we go out to eat a lot!) Many servers will give you the cold shoulder when they know you aren't paying for your meal but not Travis.  The food was over the top exceptional. Hot when received, tasty and generous portions. We highly recommend this place (and try to sit in Travis' section!)"}
{"text":"Great margaritas; super fresh food...love their tacos! Salsa, guacamole & bean dip so yummy! Cute local place serving some unique & spicy deliciousness!"}
{"text":"By far, THE best place EVER. Truly. So so delicious. The staff is great, but really the food is what earns the 5 stars. It is truly delicious. You get free chips and salsa (again delicious, chips are hot, salsa is yummy) and then the meal.. I get their chimichanga every time, it's not like any other I have ever had. I've been wanting to try other dishes, but I just love that dish! My parents get their chicken dish-- they love it and go here every anniversary to get that dish. Their potato filled chile is amazing and I remember it as a young child as they would bring home leftovers and us kids would always dig in. Fantastic place! Definitely give it a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and never really been too impressed.  The food is edible, the prices reasonable, the service is satisfactory.  The chips and salsa were actually quite good."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dining here Wednesday night for a birthday dinner. The outside does not due the place justice. The interior is well decorated and has a great ambiance. The service was great, our waiter was very attentive and they removed plates very promptly. 

Regarding the eats, the rainbow chips and chipotle salsa was really good. I had the chorizo stuffed chicken and it was very flavorful. We also had the seafood quesadilla and the lobster enchilada. The quesadilla was delicious but the lobster enchilada was a little on the sweet side. For desert we had the sophapillas. They were so light and fluffy, one of my favorites. 

I will definitely make my way back soon."}
{"text":"Great chili relino, amazing ribs. And be sure to get the 1/2 carafe Ferrari margarita"}
{"text":"Realy like this place we go here and there check it out prices average 10-20 per plate was in my area forever neighborhood gem"}
{"text":"Great dinner.  Good service.  Excellent food.  Clean restaurant.  We had a great family meal for six and a half.  The menu is filled with descriptive New Mexico food fare. Hard to choose just one.  Service was attentive.  Food was worth a little wait and obviously from scratch, made to order.  Perfect food delivery using position points and facing the entree at 6 o'clock , ladies first; not expected but well received.  Bathrooms cleaner than the one at home.  Sangria (red or white) and local Draft beer selection with Mexican classics.  No room for dessert."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food!  My 2nd time dining here and won't be my last.  Delicious and very friendly service."}
{"text":"The building is uninviting.  If it wasn't for a business dinner, I would not eat here.  I got carne adovada with green chile. It was a little overcooked and flavorless.  However service was excellent.  Perhaps it's because we brought 35 people on a Tuesday night.  The guacamole was missing something - garlic and jalapeño?  My coworker found four inches of hair in her stuffed chicken.  They replaced her dish within minutes.  I work with respectful folks so no one said anything bad about the food but no one said anything good about the food.  A few plates were empty so you can interpret that however you want.  I don't live in AZ so I can only speak of this experience."}
{"text":"{Actual Date of Visit: 11/22/11}

I went here with some friends at the suggestion of a classmate who is native to New Mexico.  I had tex-mex food when I was last in N.Mexico and loved it.  I had the Garden Enchilada which was tasty.  I appreciated the fact that they had some nice veggie options and in different sizes.  The Daiquiri was outstanding!  My friend loved her Chorizo Stuffed Chicken but the chili pepper mashed potato was dry.  The waiter was cute and very personable.  He traded out our traditional salsa for the bean dip which was yummy!  Overall it was a good experience, but I would have to go back and try more things to see their range."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on Check Please AZ and decided to give it a try. I made a reservation as there were 4 of us annd I knew it would be busy because of the show. We were sat immediately and our server came quickly for drinks and brought tri-colored chips and salsa.  She then took our order. We all ordered the stacked enchiladas but each a bit different from the other. Now for the not so good stuff.  About 15 minutes later she came back to us to say she forgot to put in part of our order and needed to verify everything that was ordered. So we gave her our order again and waited.......and waited........and waited. Finally, after waiting over an hour, our food came.......and did it was AMAZING! Each enchilada had a generous amount  of meat, and the green chili sauce was sooooo flavorful. They all came with rice and beans.  The waitress came by again to ask us how the food was and to apologize for the wait. Along with our table issue, there was a party of 14+ that came in just before us and they threw off the reservation schedule.  

Despite all the issues, we all want to go back again as there are other items on the menu we want to try."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.   Didn't look like much on the outside, or inside but the food was good, but the service can be suspect"}
{"text":"This is great New Mexico-style Mexican food.  The \"Land of Enchantment\" is a stand out dish--steak with 2 shrimp and a chicken enchilada: Very good.  There were lots of things I wanted to try on a future visit.  Great salsa and that dark red Santa Fe-like sauce, whatever its called. This place has good service, great food and good atmosphere. Definitely have some of the more NM-styled dishes rather than the basic Mex fare."}
{"text":"What would we do without yelp?   Great find.   Good was fresh, homemade & delicious.    A little different than regular Mexican food, which is good.  Four of us are, everything was great."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!

My boyfriend suggested this place and when I asked him the type of food he mentioned something about burgers....after taking a look at their reviews on Yelp figured it would not hurt to check it out.

The service was great; our waitress was extremely friendly and prompt with getting us refills on our chips & salsa - which we needed a lot of because they were amazingly good. The salsa had the perfect amount of seasoning to make it spicy enough to have you going for more without burning your mouth off. The chips were warm out of the oven and I could have ate a basket full!

They offer Sangria (white or red) by the pitcher - sure enough we ordered a red one. It was really good and I was pretty lit after my first drink.

I had the Chimichilada - you get a choice of beef or chicken chimi, I had the beef and you also get a portabella mushroom enchilada. This dish was delicious and will go back for more. You get a lot of food on this plate so you will more than likely have enough for lunch the next day and it was just as divine a day later.

My boyfriend ordered the Blue Adobe Hamburger which was voted onto Phoenix's top 10 - hence why I thought it was a burger joint.

We had a wonderful experience, amazing good and will be frequenting Blue Adobe more often."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food, period!  The margaritas are fantastic, the adobe sauce(s) are wonderful on basically anything....  its a must go if you find yourself in Mesa."}
{"text":"Really great happy hour!!! We went on Saturday at about 4pm and they have $4 house margaritas(in a pint glass), $3 drafts, and $2 off everything on the front of the menu.  My shrimp quesadilla was cooked right, my boyfriends posole was really good(not traditional and had a nice bay leaf after taste), and our extra crispy cheese crisp was pretty good.  My only complaint is the mango salsa I got with the quesadilla was mediocre at best.  Service was great, our waitress was attentive, helpful, and nice.  I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"To simply label this another variety of Mexican restaurant would be disingenuous.  On any given night when it's cooler you can smell the Pecan wood burning in the grill when you drive past. The menu is labeled by the owners as \"New Mexican\" cuisine, and can pass just about any sort of snob test for its price range and even a bit higher- although the facade of the building and the overall feel of the place is a bit downscale.

The salsa is medium with a genuine smoky flavor, the salads are fantastic with European style Goat and Mexican Cotija cheeses, and the Chicken and Pork entrees are far and away better , and more original, than anything you will find in a shopping center close the I-10 in Chandler. If you choose something other than the normal Southwestern style fare: Enchilada/Relleno/ Chimichanga (which are good), you will most likely be treated to the taste of a real pecan fire. For dessert try a Southwestern Tiramasu- Wow."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and got the Salmon Wrap, which isn't the first thing that comes to mind with a New Mexican food place, but it was incredible. Unfortunately though we didn't have the quickest service and ended up waiting quite a while for our food. Disappointing service but the food was worth the wait."}
{"text":"In town on last day of western holiday, craving some Southwest flavor

After 10 years in Houston, followed by 12 years in 'Mexican cuisine hell'....Europe, Cincinnati and now Charlotte.....we were blessed to find Blue Adobe near our hotel

Meal was outstanding.  Wife had tamales, oldest son had house specialty carne adovada, and I had jambalaya....yes, I said jambalaya.

All were flavorful, spicy and smokey, and did not disappoint.  New Southwest flavor with kick, heart and soul

Highly recommend a stop in when you are in Mesa area"}
{"text":"Recommended by family members who have been there several times. On the night we visited, we had to wait an extra 25 min despite a reservation. It is a small place, and it was late and didn't appear frantically busy.
  Crab cake app was had very little crab too much bread binder on tons of salad greens and grated fontina? cheese. Not good.
New Mexican pasta dish not flavorful, drowning in sauce that tasted like pure heavy cream without seasoning. Lazy enchiladas had pork meat that was very greasy. Stacked enchiladas nothing special.  Carne adovada  was good.  Waiter good. 
Busboy terrible. He came to our table twice to tell us he would return with more chips once, then more soda another time. Never returned with either."}
{"text":"Terrible place to go.  Had lunch on 7/29/18 with my wife.  Both meals were terrible.  My wife had a chimichanga and I had enchiladas.  Mine made me sick.  Don't waste your $'s.  I'm from New Mexico originally and this is not NM Mexican food."}
{"text":"New Mexico-style food in Mesa, AZ. This place is a hidden jewel. Quite and comfortable. All the food I've tried is delicious."}
{"text":"Agree with everyone - don't judge a book by it's cover.

Sure, the neighborhood is sketchy. It's one of those places where you're just there for the restaurant. It has its own lot behind the building, so there's no stress - about lack of parking (jeez, such a breath of fresh air for us visitors from L.A.) OR your car being jacked.

The food was amazing! Usually at these kinds of Tex-Mex-ish places (even though it's actually \"New Mexican\"), you shovel down the food and give it good reviews afterwards because you were hungry after two margaritas. Not here - everything was delicious. The bean dip was really good and hard not to fill up on. The chimichanga was so tasty, I actually ate a few bites with the sauce scraped off, just to taste it on its own.

For those of us who have had actual New Mexican food, the red and green chile sauces are the barometer. I can vouch that both are good - because they knew what to do when I asked for my main dish \"Christmas-style\".

Service was nice and the atmosphere was laid-back but fun. If you seek that Southwestern cuisine you can only get in AZ and NM, you need to get over here."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great New Mexican Food Blue Adobe is the place to go! We have been going there for a few years now and have never been disappointed! The food is great! To Start off the Chips and Salsa are out of this world good! I could easily just eat there Chips and Salsa for a meal! Anything you get on there Menu will be good! i have never gotten anything bad! My personal favorite is the \"Land Of Enchantment\"! It is a Tenderloin, with Green Chile potato, vegetables and Shrimp! It is kinda pricey but well worth it!! If you wanna try a new good place to eat Go to Blue Adobe!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and ok service. The enchiladas stack was very good. Not super heavy with a ton of cheese. It was very fresh and flavorful. Their fresh salsa is really good. I think it was my favorite part of lunch. This service was a little slow but still we will be back:)"}
{"text":"Posole was incredible. The steak was so tender, I cut it with my fork. The salmon tacos were out of this world. My date had the killer margarita and she said it killed. It was amazing! This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Salads here are huge and ever sooo tasty! Also, we find the stacked enchiladas to be delectable! Enjoy the plentiful wine offerings! New Mexico cuisine at its finest!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here with family for about two years and while the food is always consistent, I'm sad to say the cocktails are not.  In all the time I've gone, I've watched bartenders \"shake\" drinks without any ice, and when they do happen to shake with ice, they very rarely poured that over new ice. This is a problem for two reasons: when you pour a mixed drink WITHOUT shaking it with ice, and proceed to pour that mixture into a glass of ice, the liquid doesn't automatically get cold, so 100% of the time I'm left with drinking lukewarm margaritas that do not get cold by the time I'm done with it.  
Second, when you shake with ice and don't pour over new ice, I'm left with nearly melted ice from the shaker that only serves to water down my drink to an undesirable degree. 
I've been bartending for nearly 10 years (four of those years were at Mexican restaurants) and it's always been standard to shake/stir every mixed drink with ice and to pour that over new ice. This helps dilute the alcohol, chill the drink, and keep it chilled with the fresh ice. The fact that the bartenders here don't do this CONSISTENTLY is upsetting because it can only mean one of two things: there's a lack of knowledge in bartending or it's pure laziness. Neither of these qualities belong behind the bar because they take away from the customer's experience and make the drinks they're paying for not worth the money.  Only sharing in hopes that this will improve the bar standards here"}
{"text":"What a gem of a find! My husband and I and 2 of our friends were in the mood for Mexican the other night and found this place on Yelp. Wish we would have arrived sooner, as we were \"those people\" who showed up 20 minutes before closing and our wait staff seemed to be justifiably irked. Even with that said, we were well taken care of and our meals were delicious!
This gem is in an old A framed Village Inn. Completely remodeled inside with lots of dark stained wood tables and beams and exposed brick. Very cozy and inviting atmosphere!
They have daily specials written on chalk boards all around the restaurant and their menu is chalk full of delicious offerings ranging from your standard Mexican and New Mexican fare along with many seafood choices, pastas and burgers! My friend and I both had the Layered Enchiladas. I had mine with the green chile and chicken, he had it with red and green chile, chicken and an egg on top. Both were served with rice and beans. All of it was very tasty and enough spice to keep me reaching for my Prickly Pear margarita!
My husband had the Taos Combo, consisting of a honey smoked pork tamale, shrimp enchilada and tenderloin relano. He said it had a kick but all the flavors were amazing! My other friend had the Lobster Tamales, she said the raspberry chipotle made that dish! We all shared a pitcher of the Prickly Pear margaritas which were also refershing and delicious! 
Their prices are fantastic and portions are perfect! Can't wait to go back again! (earlier next time) and try a seafood dish! Their breakfast looks really good too!
4 stars are based on the full experience, granted it was our fault for getting their right before close, but the wait staff should have been a bit more friendly. Don't think any of them smiled and they barely spoke to us. We weren't rushed, I just felt regardless of our timing, they should have been a bit warmer in reception."}
{"text":"Visited Blue Adobe Grille due to a groupon my mom had found. I showed up with my parents and got sat down immediately. We all ordered margaritas and the chorizo stuffed chicken. The food was out before you know it alongside wonderful customer service. I couldn't have asked for anything more. I know I will be bringing my boyfriend and his family in soon so they could be aware of this awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Nice ambiance, great service, and fantastic food! It get super busy though so call ahead for reservations if you are going to get there after about 5pm."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by this restaurant's exterior because the quality of the food and it's inviting atmosphere is worth experiencing! I am ashamed to say it took me a year of living so close before I even tried it and it was a waste of a year. The food options are plentiful and you can't go wrong with almost any dish you order there."}
{"text":"I have not been here in 4 years and the food is still as good as it was then.  The Mango Margarita and the Oceanfront New Mexico were very good."}
{"text":"Delicious food from start to finish from chips and salsa to our main entrees definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. Nice sized portions full of flavor. I had the Carne Adovada and was not disappointed. My wife had the Lazy Taco's which she thoroughly enjoyed as well. We went around 6:30 on a Saturday and they were pretty busy. By the time we left there were open tables. Kind of like it went in waves. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've been to the Blue Adobe Grille a few times and really like it.  Food is spicy and good.  The salsa is amazing and fresh.  Love their pulled pork.  Really good.  The atmosphere is also pleasant and nice.  The service has been OK.  I can see why some people have said bad things but it didn't bother me much.  I'll continue coming back."}
{"text":"My wife,  daughter and son-in-law dined there after a Cubs Spring training game. Our waiter Gordon was outstanding. He helped us with recommendations on the menu and obviously enjoyed working there.
  
I had the  spinach salad for a starter. It was a nice mix of textures and flavors with spinach,  strawberries, cheese crumbles, pine nuts and small tortilla strips with a light dressing. My wife and I shared the Desert
Pasta dish with the shrimp added. It came with a vegetable medley mixed in with a sauce with a light kick. Again a very enjoyable dish.

I will be sure to dine here again the next time we are in town"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant for any occasion. It's comfortable inside and the staff is very personable. They make Patron margaritas and the salsa is tasty. I've only had the Chimichilada ... but that's because once you taste the amaretto mushroom cream sauce, you won't want anything else."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have eaten here.  Took a detour off the beaten path and was not disappointed.   Food was well seasoned and thoughtfully prepared.   I will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time for a to go order for lunch. When I asked for a Chili Verde Burro, the server said they didn't have them on the menu...  only Chili Verde Carne  (which is served as a stew with tortillas on the side). She thought for a moment and then said she would ask the kitchen to wrap it as a burro. 

It was the best I've had in a while. Tender, slow cooked, monster chunks of pork in  a delicious gravy, served with spanish rice and fresh cooked pinto beans. 

I'm  a Native and this is the kind of Mexican food I had as a kid here in the valley. A must-try on my list."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I don't want to review this place because when you find a gem you want to keep it to yourself!  It's on the small side so call ahead for reservations. Everything on the menu is delicious. I had the portobello enchiladas and thought it the best thing I've ever tasted!!  Outside is kinda sketchy but inside very cozy."}
{"text":"The only place in the area that had decent reviews for dinner. First, don't judge this gem by its exterior, I almost didn't make it in because of it. Nicely decorated, air conditioned and smells pleasant. I had the chile rellenos with shrimp. Yum. House made red sauce? Double yum. My dinner companions had the salmon wrap (which she said was a bit fishy but not too bad) and the lazy chicken tacos (she said these were very good). So overall, yes I would come back here. We didn't have any service issues and it wasn't badly priced. However, I wouldn't drive up from chandler to just eat here."}
{"text":"I rarely disagree with the average yelp ratings... I tried Blue Adobe based on great reviews but was greatly disappointed.

I really can't find a redeeming quality about the night... I had their \"killer margarita\" which is a cheaper house margarita, it was lousy, i was a bartender for some time myself, there is no reason to make a margarita that bad, you can do better, especially here in AZ we are a mecca of citrus!

The bean and cheese dip appetizer was uninspired, nothing special... I saw lobster tamales on the menu and couldn't get past them, i could not think of a way that someone could make a tamale with lobster and make it well, so i was really excited to see how they do it... poorly was how they did it, lobster was over cooked there was very little of it in the tamale and the biggest issue was exactly what i thought it would be, the corn masa just overpowered the little lobster that was in the tamale... they could have put imitation crab in there and saved them self a bunch of money and it would taste the same... it just doesn't work! There was a raspberry chipotle sauce on the side that was very good, but again this too took away from the whole point of the dish: the lobster.  

tried a chimmichunga, whatever, not special.  

service was no good, our waitress was very frantic, I felt like i was a burden or a bother to her (and no, I'm not. I've spent years in food service, makes you very kind to your server)

It seems like snow birds keep this place in business, the restaurant was full of them... they must forget what their experience was like over the summers..."}
{"text":"This is, by far, our favourite restaurant in the world! Starting with the chips & smoked salsa, right through to the creme brûlée, every dish we have tried (and over the 10 years since we discovered it have been there 18 times) has been full of flavour and a delight to the taste buds. If ever in Mesa, you have to make this a place to dine at brunch, lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Solid restaurant, I went here b/c it was close the Mesa Arts Center ([rave] that place is awesome! [/rave]) and was pretty pleased with the experience.  I'd heard good things about it on Chowhound, and so was expecting solid food.  They have a very New Mexican menu that seems to be heavy on the seafood special.  I got the blue crab enchilada and was quite pleased with the flavors and freshness of the sauce and rice, while the enchilada itself was literally stuffed with tender, moist crab.  I also had a delicious prickly pear margarita.  

The atmosphere is kind of interesting: the decor is surprisingly stylish, with the specials written in chalk on several big boards on the wall, and an inviting, pleasing palette of colors throughout.  The open layout was kind of funky, and I was a bit disappointed there were no booths in the entire place.  You could tell they didn't have a huge remodeling budget when they opened, but they did pretty well with what they had.  The neighborhood isn't great, but I don't hold that against the place.  I do think the time is ripe for a West Mesa revival, a la 7th and Melrose or the Sunnyslope area.  You heard it here first...  (I really need to get a blog again)

Overall, a good-to-great experience, and I'll definitely plan on going there again prior to MAC shows, but I doubt I would drive out to downtown Mesa to eat there again just for itself.  It's not quite a standout in a pretty crowded genre, but it's certainly a solid choice for those in the area."}
{"text":"No one from New Mexico would ever call this Mexican food much less new Mexican food. I would recommend 8 miles south on Arizona Ave and si señor. It was pretty rough as far as the food goes."}
{"text":"This is a delightful establishment.  The food is delicious and the staff is friendly, helpful and efficient.  I hope they will franchise their 'New Mexican food' concept.  Many people will want to know.  A famous chef dined here and said, \"this is the best restaurant in Mesa\".  I enjoyed the taste of their food; and I'm a believer."}
{"text":"We just had the Santa Fe Bay special again! SO GOOD! We have been coming for years and the food and service is always amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Had dinner here after finding in Yelp and the positive reviews were dead on. The service was outstanding and the flavor in the food was original and amazing. We will be back here for sure at sometime in the future.
 I only wish I could have given it 6 stars because that's what it should get.
There are a lot of food choices in the area but do not miss any opportunity that you have to dine here. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants ever!! The food is different and so amazing. The shrimp is cooked over pecan wood and my favorite are the portobello mushroom enchiladas with the amaretto cream sauce. They are a bit sweet but omg soooo amazing!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I had the Meatloaf and it was amazing! Usually with meatloaf its dry and over cooked this was the perfect consistency and cooked perfectly. You wouldn't think it would be some that you would order at a Mexican food restaurant but it is amazing! Very clean place with good service. This is a good call for a really good Mexican food joint. I gave them 5 meatloafs, something that is rarely given out..."}
{"text":"If you love spicy and seafood, get the shrimp cocktail rellenos!   I've also tried the seafood enchiladas and Chimichilada plates.  All are amazing!  I would highly recommend to get their green sauce, though.  Normally when I have mexican food I get red sauce, however, the red sauce here is not fantastic.  Also, I'm not too crazy about their rice and beans."}
{"text":"Love this place. The enchiladas and spicy pasta are awesome!  Good margaritas and a cute building with lots of parking.  Only thing is that I always feel like I am sitting in the middle of the room.  It's sort of a strange restaurant lay out.  But overall an awesome restaurant with good food and good service!"}
{"text":"if you have a groupon ,,,read the small print.you can not use it to your advantage during happy hour. so if you go in and order anything on the happy hour menue,ypu ate being charged regular price for what ever food or beverage you order. and oh,,,this was just decided last week by the owner. my recommendations are to find another place that still respects the customers values...no more for us..."}
{"text":"** Carne Adovada **

{"text":"Cute place inside. Top notch service and good prices. Shared the crab cakes which were on a fantastic salad, then shared a chili relleno. Even had a sparkling clean glass for my wine, which is a big plus for me. Loved this place!"}
{"text":"The place was amazing had the best green chills ever!  The stacked enchiladas were phenomenal and the service was great out waitress always made sure our drinks were full we had everything we needed and even went out of her way and above and beyond to get us a box of ice so we could take our food home sense we were hitting up an escape room first!  W a party of 7 couldn't have asked for a better place to go."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Blue Adobe, and I won't be back. The first visit was for a family birthday dinner, about 10 people, and they had trouble coordinating our tables, goofed up our orders, and generally didn't seem to care about us much at all. But the food was tasty (once they got it right) so I thought I'd try again with the EVFN group.

Two of the staff seemed trying to help, but everyone else either ignored us or seemed inconvenienced by all of us ordering dinner and drinks. What a mess.

Now I know the service problem wasn't a fluke. It seems to be a restaurant living on a very good cook's skills in the kitchen, and those skills are the only reason it isn't getting a single star. For good New Mexican style food, I'd suggest Los Dos Molinos not too far away."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend.

I freely admit as a disclaimer, the New Mexico style Mexican food is a second compared to southern az style in my personal favorite.
I am also VERY picky when it comes to Mexican food.
I was pleasantly surprised of the quality of the food and flavors

Location is a little strange for a restaurant  of this style and price range, would have expected more scottsdale location. 

I had the rellenos and the wife had the blue adobe burger with a relleno on top We shared the three dip appetizer.

My rellenos were pretty good. The Panko crust was an interesting but good departure from traditional coatings. I really liked the use of Anaheim vs a poblano chile, I much prefer it. I had one plain cheese and one tenderloin chorizo and cheese. The plain cheese one was huge and very tasty. The meat one was much smaller, had very little steak in it and no chorizo I could taste. The rice and beans were tasty. I liked the flavor and loved the drier rice vs mushy mess you get at many Mexican restaurants. The pintos were well flavored.
Probably the highlight was the red sauce which I requested on the side due to my natural suspicion of any New Mexico style resteraunt's ability to do red sauce anywhere close to right. I recant. It was amazing! Very dark, chile rich and just amazing on the tongue. Almost a mole without the chocolate or pumpkin seeds, I am guessing a very dark roux. I love homemade red chile sauce and would pay to sit in the kitchen and learn that one.

The wife's burger was very large and her relleno on it was also very good sized as was the portion of fries. They forgot the bacon, which the wait staff promptly fixed, and the only condiment they brought was ketchup. I gave my wife the green sauce they brought gratis with my red sauce. She are it with a knife and fork it was so big.

The appeztizer was ok. Bean dip excellent, guacamole ok lobster dip ok. Fried flour tortillas they brought for the dips were soggy and under cooked. Wait staff promptly fixed,
Corn chips and salsa were good.

Last but certainly not least was the service. It was absolutely top shelf. Staff and management were attentive, knowledgeable without being smothering, or smarmy. Just right balance around the board. Questions were answered and suggestions were sincere. 

Would have loved to give a 5 except for the misses listed above"}
{"text":"I couldn't give it a 1 star because the food was decent. The service is terrible! I was one of 5 people there for lunch and I was there for well over an hour! Besides the convict that decided to smoke out back rather than take my order and then proceed to be as slow as possible, it was mediocre. Find another spot!"}
{"text":"First time, here.

Good, family type vibe.

Cuisine of New Mexico comes to Arizona.

Crab Cake appetizer was just OK. Calamari steak appetizer was AWESOME.

Top shelf margaritas were weak. Short of tequila.

3 of us for dinner.

1 HUGE order of beatiful ribs.

1 combo of beef taco, chicken enchilada, and pork tamale.

1 combo of pork tamale and chili rellano.

The pork tamales were some of the best I've ever had.

All the mains and sides were great.  Red & green salsas, of course, New Mexico.

Solid, friendly service.

This appears to be a place for locals. I was happy to find it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really good fresh food. Not greasy and great flavor.  Service was slow and the staff seemed more interested in whatever they were doing and not the waiting tables.  I would go back though!"}
{"text":"The portobello enchilada is amazing!!! My wife had the chicken burrito and it was amazing . we also ordered the portobello pizza which wasn't that great. the service is slow and not very organized."}
{"text":"Yum! Great, fast service! We eat here often. Try the daiquiri!"}
{"text":"Great food!
My wife and I happened to stumble upon this restaurant one night after an event at the Mesa Arts Center - I'm glad we did! Our dinner was amazing, and I heard other guests commenting about how delicious the food was as well. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean and had a fun vibe. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Really a great place with the very best \"last nights meatloaf \" that melts in your mouth! 
Happy Hour margarita was very good as well! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in New Mexico and was thrilled to come across this restaurant w/\"New Mexico\"anything on the sign. Although this restraunt is not serving authentic New Mexican dishes, what they do serve is really good! I have never had a relleno w/meat in it as well as the usual cheese like they serve here. It was awesome! Like it said in a number of other reviews, it gets busy....but, it gets busy because it's good! If having to wait a little while deters you from trying this place then go somewhere without a wait and enjoy your not so great food ;) just saying...
Definitely try this place out. I am SO glad
 to have come across it. I look forward to going again soon! 
Portions are big enough that i took my leftovers home and it was a whole nother meal. I bought extra sopapilla (if you are a new Mexican be sure to tell the waitress you want the sopapilla w/no powdered sugar on them. Take home your left overs and make some stuffed sopapilla baby!,yum
They do charge for the soppapillas* but, New Mexicans gotta get those! :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for tasty New Mexican Food in the Valley. Redecorated since I was here last time. What an improvement. Outside and inside are nicely done up with a comfortable rustic vibe that makes you feel right at home. You can smell the aroma of the Pecan Wood as you get out of your car. Gets me excited right away. Nice!

Been here maybe a couple dozen times or more. Sometimes on business and the food is always delicious. Great place to take friends visiting or clients from out of town. 

Some of the items we enjoy are the FREE Fire Roasted Salsa with Tri-Colored Tortilla Chips, the Fresh Guacamole, Green Chile Lobster Dip, the Adobe Salad, the Carne Adovada, the Taos Combo, the Santa Cafe, Chorizo Stuffed Chicken, Spooning Rellenos, Last Night's Meat Loaf, and a few of my all time favorites when I am not paying, the Land of Enchantment, the Oscar Medallion and the Tucamcari. Too many to list them all.

What makes the difference here is the way they fire roast their tomatoes, peppers, and onions for the salsa as well as the meats they grill using that delicious Pecan Wood. Oh Yeah!

Can get pretty busy during peak hours and the service sometimes is a little spotty. Ask for a table next to the windows or up front. The back section requires a flash light to read the menu and see the food. Good thing I have one on my Smart Phone. Simply Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place. New Mexican cuisine doesn't get any better than this. From the bacon green chili cheeseburger to the spooning rellenos. Amazing."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was excellent. Prices were great, the food was fantastic, portion sizes were huge....and did I say that the food was fantastic?

The salsa was made over smoked pecans, and it was, hands down, some of the best salsa I've ever tasted. I ordered a few different items from the menu, including a \"Christmas\" (red and green salsa) enchilada, some carne adovada, and a chicken taco. The meal came with rice and beans (cooked to perfection) and all this for $15.

Our server was fantastic - attentive, and very helpful when suggesting menu items. The atmosphere was welcoming and comfortable.

All in all, this place was a great experience, and my team and I were all very thankful we came.

5 stars."}
{"text":"I LOVE Blue Adobe Grill. The food is great! I can go here when I want delicious New Mexican food but I'm not prepared to pay Richardson's prices. The service is usually pretty good but when it's really busy at lunchtime, the servers seem a bit frazzled. I usually stick to the rellenos or the carne adovada. The salsa is also wonderful. I've made myself hungry just thinking about it..."}
{"text":"No check in offers. The complimentary chips and salsa are delicious. The killer margarita is the best you can get for $6. Service is a bit slow because they seem under staffed, the bartender was doing everything Literally! I got the enchantment dish. It didn't look like the picture or anyone else picture. The steak was ok the shrimp eh. I plan to revisit and try the stacked enchiladas though."}
{"text":"The outside isn't much to look at but the food is fantastic!  It's New Mexican style which means you aren't going to find gooey platters of cheese.  The chips and salsa are fantastic.  I had the chicken tacos and they were divine.  The rice and beans were also delicious.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Blue Adobe is a little blue sapphire in the rough! 

The service was prompt and courteous.  The complementary chips and salsa were yummy....but I wish they had a hot salsa option. I went for lunch, and had the portobello mushroom enchalada with rice and beans.  The enchalada was very rich with Adobe cream sauce and cheese. It had a very unique flavor....oddly familiar. I couldn't pin point it until I asked. It was ameretto. Ahhh!! That's it! The ameretto added a distinct flavor, but I think it was almost overpowering. Just a tad less would've been nice! The rice and (pinto) beans were flavored to perfection! 

The New Mexican cuisine was a delight!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Seriously LOVE this place!!  I promise it is all good!!  Yummy food, not the best neighborhood, but we have never had a problem.. :)"}
{"text":"This place is always delicious but can get a bit pricey. They're salsa and enchiladas are my favorite!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since it was close to our hotel...boy am I glad we found it!!!! Everything we had was absolutely delicious!! My husband had the Lazy Tacos with chicken which also came with rice and beans. I had Crab Stuffed Salmon with a deep fried potato pancake and vegetables. Boy they don't skimp on the chicken in the tacos...it was so much my husband couldn't even eat it all. My salmon was so good that I everything...to the point I was over full by the time we left!! I would definitely be recommending this place to my friends and family...not to mention this is a place I will definitely be back to when I am in town for Spring Training next season!!"}
{"text":"Fresh all you can eat chips and a nice variety of items on the menu.  Salsa was not very good and guacamole had little flavor.  Not enough waitstaff working but we still enjoyed the meal overall.  The bad part was we all got sick from the food including my kids.  Tried to tell the Manager about it but they were having no part of listing to us and didn't want to hear it.  Eat at your own risk!!!  Been in the Food business 30 years and if your Managers don't care the kitchen help doesn't care.  Improper food handling at this location and more than likely improper cooling and rotation of product.  Don't listen to the positive reviews, this could be your last meal..."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch (early dinner?) here today and was blown away by the great service! The food came out quickly.

The chile rellenos ARE FANFUCKINGTASTIC. The enchiladas were ok - they're really meaty, so my boyfriend enjoyed it, but I usually love dishes that have lots of veggies. Just personal preference. The complimentary nachos and salsa are high quality too. 

But the real winner was the pumpkin brulee, which was likely to be seasonal because it was on the chalkboard specials and not the menu. It's $8, which seems steep but the pumpkin brulee is QUITE big so it's definitely big enough to share between 2-3 people.

(Unless you are a sugar fiend like me - I ate the whole thing by myself!)

Happy hour is a good deal - you can get house margaritas for $4!

The service was what convinced me to give the last star.. Seriously great!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to blue Adobe for years. The food is great. Two of my favorites are shrimp lazy taco and chorizo stuffed chicken. The shrimp lazy taco has a good smoky flavor. The chorizo stuffed chicken is very tender and tasty."}
{"text":"I knew we would be in the neighborhood around lunch so I went with my faithful yelp. 

My hubby and I really enjoyed our dining experience at this Santa Fe style grill. It was an unassuming building outside but clean and inviting inside. The staff was very pleasant and attentive.

I really enjoyed the dark smoky, non-standard tomato salsa with the fresh red, white and blue tortilla chips. I ate the whole thing, chips and all. Delish!

I had the Ocean Front plate. It was a delicious Shrimp Cocktail Relleno that was crunchy with a kicky shrimp cocktail sauce and a yummy Lobster Tamale with a bright, fresh Mango Salsa & Raspberry Chipotle sauce. 

My hubby had the Carne Adovada. Simmered in a smoky Red Chile Adobo Sauce, it was tender and flavorful.

Both dishes were generous and I was bummed I could not make it to dessert.

I do not live very close, but would consider making the drive to dine here again and again."}
{"text":"Great food, great presentation. Excellent beef tenderloin, and chile-baked pork loin!"}
{"text":"Good food..Service was pretty bad but I'll go back because everyone deserves a chance to redeem themselves :)"}
{"text":"The best new mexican food I have had besides in santa fe. Red adovada rocks. Relleno rocks. Service is awsome, it is clean and has a good atmosphere. I cant say enough. Not typical mexican if your pallet is more than pleased with Garcias you probably wont be thrilled like me."}
{"text":"I've had many great meals at Blue Adobe, they serve strong drinks and spicy food!  The service is always top notch."}
{"text":"The bottom line first, will a I go back?  YES!  I would go back if the food was average because of the service.  BUT I'm happy to say I was equally please with my meal.  I went for the relleno because of what I read here on yelp.  I had a relleno and a mushroom enchilada with a sweet amaretto sauce.  Both were very good, the chili relleno had a very tasty crusty batter, seasoned with a flavorful chili mixture.  This was the first time I had a relleno prepared that way, it won't be the last.  The mushroom enchilada was great, I balanced the sweetness with salsa. I'm looking forward to going back to try a different enchilada along side the mushroom.  Our waiter was the best!  This place is keeper.  
Be Peace, Candice!"}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix & Mesa on business a little bit back and only had time for one sit-down meal. This is the place our hotel suggested. The rest of the group really liked their food (or at least pretended to...I don't know), but I thought my blue seafood enchiladas were kind of dry. It just kind of fell beneath my expectations. And the pineapple juice was sooooooo sweet. In a bad way."}
{"text":"Ate here after the Cubs game. It was around 3:30, so I don't think we ordered from the lunch menu. The sign said New Mexico food, but my experience with New Mexico is much hotter and more volume then flavor.
I had a Mimi Chimi with chicken. It very good and just the correct size. Beans served with it were also very good.
Sarah had a barbecue chicken pizza. It was more then she could eat and was very good.
A pleasant place to eat. Good service and prices were reasonable too. Several others came in who had also been to the game, so this must be a well known place to eat after a game, even though it is not real close to the park.
We will be back soon."}
{"text":"A pleasant Oasis of quality, affordable Mexican cuisine smack-dab in the middle of fast-food hell, I found The Blue Adobe to be a refreshing break from the seemingly endless array of franchise-clones that plague every corner of the greater Mesa area.

My first visit to Blue Adobe was immediately following a 14 hour drive from San Francisco with my ladyfriend Tassie and two drugged-out cats that somehow managed to howl most of  the way down.  We were tipped off to the place by another colleague of mine that had moved to Sun Valley about three years prior.  I was a little worried when I saw the establishments Howard-Johnson's style exterior, but all fears evaporated when we entered what I consider to be a first class effort at creating a great dining environment, and doing so without exuding the slightest bit of pretentiousness. 

The menu was pretty interesting too....it was creative without resorting to obnoxious San Francisco-style creativity where the menu description gives little clue as to what you'll be served. To the contrary...the menu did a great job of describing traditional Mexican fare, skillfully presenting additional nuances that came across as tempting details rather than vague liabilities.

The food was great...tasty, and with several marks of distinctions that set it apart from anything else I've had in the Mesa area.  Skillful presentation, creative seasonings, and the absence of excessive fat were among it's strong points.

We went here twice, and both times we sung it's praises.  But Tassie returned here with her relatives one day, and not all went well.  The staff was friendly as usual till one party showed up with a infant/toddler.  It took eons to get a high-chair, and from that point on the level of service went from warm-and-fuzzy to cold-and-distant.  I still give it thumbs up for grownups....but reports from afar tell me that this place is anything but kid-friendly."}
{"text":"Had another fantastic lunch at Blue Adobe Grille. 
Chips and Salsa were fantastic...love that spicy fire-roasted salsa.
Had the Carne Adovada, which is tender pieces of pork simmered in a really great red sauce.  Served with some really flavorful rice and delicious beans, along with their fresh tortillas (ask for an extra tortilla, because you'll want it).  I love to tear off a piece of tortilla and use it to grab some meat/rice/beans and pop the whole thing in my mouth.  Delicious!
Had to take 1/2 home and ate it for dinner!"}
{"text":"It was between Blue Adobe and TQLA in Gilbert but Blue Adobe appealed to me Bc it looked more down to earth. We were in for a surprise. It was not only very welcoming, our waitress was so kick ass! She was witty and nice. The food is bomb and we have never tasted flavors like this. At first we thought it was a typical Mexican restaurant but it's more New Mexico style. My man had the ancho rubbed ribs and it came w a wedge salad and cornbread, pecan cornbread, that is. It was so unique, we couldn't stop eating it! I got the Oscar Medallion meal w blue crab and jalapeño on top a cut of meat and hollandaise noodle sauce thing. Again, never experienced the flavors like that in my life but my palate just got more and more used to it. There were three TV's at a quaint bar but they were super quiet. So glad we didn't go to TQLA to get some Chilli's like quality and type of food/service at ridiculous prices. We paid $20 per meal but we were given two days worth of food and the bill came to $50 total, which was crazy Bc we had drinks and appetizers. I seriously wish I could've left the waitress a $50 tip her service was that great. This establishment has been here for 14 years! They r obviously doing something right."}
{"text":"The previous reviewers did not disappoint.  Extensive menu and full bar.  we stopped for lunch on the way to airport and the place was packed.  Service was prompt and everything was delightful. we both ordered combo plates   for a sampling and both were good...the only thing is, it's a bit pricy here.  36$ for lunch, no drinks, no appetizer.  There was 10$ and up selections"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service make this a no-brainer when your in the mood for Mexican. I had the Spooning Relleno which was one of the best Mexican dishes I've ever had. My girlfriend had a similar experience with the Stacked Enchilada. Courteous staff made the experience one I'll repeat next time I drive through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not too bad  Not the best.  Solid due to its proximity to Sun Devil Liquors."}
{"text":"Ok, so after the scathing initial review, I went back. The food's just that good. 

Service was MUCH better than my first visit. Granted, I've had better service at 3:00am in the Jack in the Box drive-thru than I got the first time around at Blue Adobe. It HAD to be better.  Not great service, but acceptable."}
{"text":"We showed up at the Mesa location on a Friday night around 6:30 and even though the restaurant seemed full we were seated immediately. I must say that I really appreciate a nice hostess and the service we received from the time we stepped in the door to the time we left was always above and beyond. We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant which was lovely because we were able to observe the lively staff and take in the design of the restaurant. Our server gave us great recommendations on drinks and food and we left satisfied and already planning our next visit back! This restaurant gets an A++ for being delicious, friendly and having a great environment. I can't wait to dine at the Blue Adobe Grille again!"}
{"text":"Went here due to all the great yelp reviews. You are all amazing cause this place is Damn good. Great service and it was served very fast."}
{"text":"In sunny Mesa for Spring Training. Went to this place twice. The first time it was a five star visit, the second not so much. First time we wet on Saturday night on the 1st of March. The food was awesome, the meatloaf for ten bucks was well worth it, I would have paid double. The guacamole was fresh and tasty. The staff was happy and friendly, the place just had a good vibe. Ok, the second time on Monday the 3rd. Woah completely different place. Service was very slow. The bartender was very unfriendly, especially compared to Saturday night. The food was mediocre. It was not hot and a crab dip type of appetizer sucked and was overpriced. By the way the owner was in the place on Monday and she was the bartender. May give you a clue to how the staff gets along with the owner. I will note we were given $10 off our bill on Monday, I guess the waiter recognized the long wait for food we had that nite."}
{"text":"But the food was excellent!

Too bad the service was so poor.  I'd called earlier in the week (Sunday) and asked if the restaurant could handle a group of approximately 30 people from 6-8 on the following Friday.  I was assured they could and that I should verify the reservation by Wednesday.  They also suggested we choose from a shorter menu to expedite everything.  Fine.  The other organizer called to verify and was assured we were welcome.  

I arrived early and found four round tops set aside for us, plus one end of  the bar.  We shoved the tables closer together hoping to get another one into that corner, but no such luck.  The single waiter struggled to take drink orders and then food orders as half our group ended up standing and shuffling around other patrons attempting to get to the restroom.  We did snag one more table but when we tried to get another one, a woman who I assumed was the manager asked those people to move - that table was reserved.  (Though is was not used until much later as we tried to check out)  A few of our group at the bar were at first told they couldn't order food, and another couldn't get water.  

We realized they just couldn't hand us and tried to get our checks.  I had to pay my drink order and my food order separately.  Two people got their checks and the rest of us ended up standing in a line to pay our bills.  Nobody helped this one poor waiter at all.

I realize we have a large group but we did call more than once in advance and were assured there wouldn't be a problem.  When I mentioned to the manager that we were not please with the service she informed me that it was our fault, and that she'd warned us they were overbooked.  Gee, I don't remember any conversation that went that way.

As far as I know, none of us had any complaints about the actual food though.  I heard many compliments and my meal was very good.  Its just that we were made to feel unwelcome, the service was very slow and the people at the bar seemed to have quite an attitude when our people tried to order anything but alcohol.

Don't say you can handle a large group and then drop the ball before we even get started."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Seafood enchilada, stacked enchiladas with fried egg, yum! Ask them to warm the salsa and it adds a Mexico City flare.. mmmmm."}
{"text":"Yum!  I can't wait for another trip from Chicago to Scottsdale to visit this place.  I was here visiting to cheer on OK state for the fiesta bowl.  This place had great reviews so I gave it a try.  The service was very good considering the place was packed (with orange).  Our waiter had excellent recommendations and all 5 in our party were satisfied with the food. I ordered the stacked enchiladas with the carne adovada.  It was great!  All the chips/salsa and the dips were good too.  If you like trying new things and have a refined palate you should stop by this place."}
{"text":"Had the seafood enchiladas...... yum!   Bartender mark is great and pleasant.  Gave us a silver dollar per drink during happy hour.  Needed help carrying them out!  Will try a wood fired entree next time.  Smells awesome with the pecan wood oven."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend. I'm always skeptical about mexican style restaurants that serve mediocre, mild salsa. Blue Adobe DID NOT disappoint from the start with yummy chips and salsa. Ordered an appetizer - Hatch Sampler - shrimp was cooked and seasoned well. The posole was delicious with the perfect amount of spice. Great service!"}
{"text":"One of the two best New Mexican style restaurants in the East Valley and to boot, it's been here for a long time.  Rustic southwest decor with fun, friendly, and at times eclectic personalities to serve you, PLUS flavorful dishes with hints of red and green chile or both if you'd like.

We went there on New Year's Eve well after the bedroom community schedule keeper's had eaten and rather than close early like many places, they were open and running on all cylinders having fun alongside all the guests.

If you're  thinking of giving this place a shot, try the Carne Adovada as it's the best in the county, hands down.  If you've been before and have tried the Carne Adovada, give the meat loaf a shot.

Lastly, very good salsa and a full bar and there's a window for pick-up orders and that's something all restaurants should have."}
{"text":"This place is about 2 miles from my house, I have driven past it at least 100 times in all the years I've been living here, yet I have never stopped...until they offered a Groupon.  I LOVE YOU, GROUPON!    We walked in the door, and the hostess greeted us immediately and sat us.  What an adorable place, very clean, low lighting, but not so low you can't see anything.  And the food, oh my, the food.  I had a stuffed chile rellano, so good.  And pumpkin flan, even better.  This is an adorable place with good service, fantastic food.  A little expensive for Mexican food, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Roasted salsa and portabella enchiladas... I'm a fan! I can't believe I've never been here.  Hottie and I are always on the hunt for good Mexican food. Scottsdale falls short every time.  This is actually a pretty quick drive for us, with the 202 right behind us.  Okay back to the food. I tried the veggie enchiladas and the portabella mushroom enchiladas. Both were good, but I don't' think I would ever order anything but the mushroom enchiladas again. They were the most delicious enchilada I've ever had... topped with a marsala sauce.. OMG!!!  For desert we had an apple crisp made with a sopapilla and topped with ice cream, a great alternative to fried ice cream.  I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I had a very yummy lunch yesterday. I opted for the pork adovada? I think that's what it was called. very tasty. my friend ordered their spinach salad w strawberries and pine nuts and that looked super tasty. 

I have two complaints:
the ceiling and the seating arrangements. 

The ceiling is really yucky and the air vents are surrounded by black stain. it makes you wonder when the last time they cleaned the filters to make the air stain the ceiling like that. and all of the crusty yellow spots crumbling away? ew. 

The seats, way uncomfortable!!! really old chairs w no tush cushion and no booths. I think it's time for an upgrade!

and lastly, it would be nice to see some more friendly lunch prices- we split the bill down the middle and it came out to $16 each, that's a bit high. I won't be returning for lunch but I would go again for dinner...maybe. when I think about sitting in those awful chairs i give it a second thought."}
{"text":"Came back to enjoy dinner with an aunt who is from the east coast. She wanted a good southwest meal and Blue Adobe Grill was the 1st thing that came to mind. Just like last time it didn't dissapoint. Everything was top notch. I tried the chili rellano with red sauce and my wife had enchanted garden enchilada.  Both dishes were so go and with that spicy kick we expected.  Best mexican in AZ."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now - the first time was dinner with some of the top food reviewers in Phoenix (RIP Urbanspoon). The second time was a birthday dinner with my mom. This place is one of those \"unexpected gems\" you hear about. It's not located in some vibrant area and the building itself doesn't look like much. Yet when you step inside, it is full of life and always packed with people. Great food and word of mouth made this place popular. The Original Blue Adobe Grill uses flavorful spices and pecan wood-fired grilling to create its signature authentic New Mexican dishes. Some highlights are the carne adovada, shrimp enchiladas, lazy tacos, stacked enchiladas, and the spooning beef tenderloin rellenos. The carne adovado has been dubbed one of the 500 things to eat before you die in a popular book. I grew up in AZ and had to order the old family recipe cheese crisp. Every time we went out for Mexican food as a family growing up, we ordered one of these. The carne adovado didn't disappoint. It was tender and flavorful and I recommend getting it Christmas style (a pairing of Hatch Red and Green Chili sauces). I also highly recommend making a reservation as the wait can be a little long getting a table."}
{"text":"I live in West Phoenix, and don't get out to this particular area often, but I've been teaching a class nearby, so I'm taking advantage of the opportunity to try some local spots.
  I was happy with the Blue Adobe. I ordered a Tenderloin Ceasar wrap, and it was quite good. The tortillas are great. The wrap made a great lunch.
  I was surprised by a side of frys. They were decent, but didn't make sense with the main course.
  The food was good, the staff friendly and courteous. A little expensive for lunch - expect to spend about $10-15 per person."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place as a cool double date location! 

We had the triple dipper. It was like bean dip, lobster dip (holy mother of god - amazing), and guac! That didn't last long.

We all had something different. My fiance had the steak and this portobello mushroom enchilada. I'm still craving the buttery cream sauce on it. 

I had the seafood enchiladas and they were good! 

Everything was good. The service. The food, the quality! We talk about going back all of the time, we just get distracted!"}
{"text":"Came here at a Yelp review and was not disappointed. Don't judge the inside by the outside of the building- it's very cute inside. The cops and salsa were very fresh and tasty, although this is not your typical salsa! I had the carne adovada, which was delicious! The pork was tender and not fatty and the sauce was good (a little spicy, but not too bad). My husband had the salmon. Everything tasted very fresh, although it came up so fast it had to have been a pick-up (already made). The service was exceptional, which is always a pleasure. My husband had the cheesecake- which is homemade (I had a bite and it was delicious!). Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Salsa and chips are so good.  The salsa is unique from any I have had at a restaurant.  

I love the chicken tacos.  The chicken is lean and smoky and the sauce is delicious.  I am not a huge fan of the enchiladas.  Not bad, just not my fav."}
{"text":"Monday turned out to be Chile Rellenos day - and that's never a bad thing, if the Rellenos are good!

We'd heard good things about Blue Adobe, and it was pretty much all true.
Good food.  Excellent service!

Our server was Austin.  He was really terrific - told him we were in a rush (grabbing a bite before a class at the Mesa Arts Center) and he got our orders in ASAP.  The chips and salsa were good, and Austin made sure we didn't run out of either (or iced tea)!

The chile rellenos were very nice - lightly battered, very flavorful.  A good bet.

My wife got the shrimp tacos and said they were a little bland - she agreed that the rellenos were good, and we're both thinking about the stacked enchilada next time.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great find a hidden gem! Packed for dinner, service was good, drinks well mixed and the peach sangria is the very best I have ever drank!! All 4 dinners where good, even our picky eater that did  a custom dinner not listed on menu ( server did not blink & dinner was delicious). Appetizer of calamari was really the best I have ever eaten. Desert was made from scratch @ the blue Adobe & again delicious.
I can not find one fault. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa, margaritas, and every dish I've ordered here has been fantastic.  

I use to travel to Phoenix for work every now and again and would make a point teach trip to visit the Blue Adobe.  Fabulous New Mexican and Tex-Mex, and the service is very friendly.

The occupancy varies.  Some nights, we'd be one of only a few parties, and other nights it would be quite crowded.  I've never had to wait for a table and have never made a reservation."}
{"text":"I loved Blue Adobe Grille. For over 13 years Ive been going there. 

Today I thought I would stop in as I was in the area. I was greeted nicely and since there was one of me  they seated me in a quiet area.

My server was prompt and friendly. The moscow mule was spot on.
I ordered the same thing Ive been ordering for over 13 years. The Cruz Kitchen - Tamale and Pork Chile Relleno. The tamale I didn't recognize. The masa was dark and little of it. Inside the meat was salty and overcooked and crunchy. Disappointment set in quickly. The rice was so-so and the beans were nondescript; however my chili Relleno was still very tasty, cooked to perfection and meaty.

The salsa was good but not as good as in the past. It was a bit on the dark side and could use a bit of lemon to brighten it.

Ill try them again but I can no longer recommend what I used to think was the best tamale in town."}
{"text":"Skip this place!  Service is terrible.  The place was empty except for one other table but we couldn't even get seated because everyone except the bartender was talking in the kitchen.  We could hear them in there but apparently they couldn't hear us (Hello?  Do we seat ourselves?  Anyone back there?)

After about 15 min. of waiting (with the bartender just starring at us the whole time) the single table of  people in the dinning room told us that they just seated themselves so they could at least get some drinks started (They ordered a few beers at the bar and then sat themselves down).  We waited another 15 min. but no one appeared to give us menus, say hi, or take our order...the bartender pointedly ignored us also as he was busy...  doing something...  We finally left without ever setting eyes on a hostess, a waitress or the menu."}
{"text":"The  place was busy on a Thursday night, but restaurants should be able to cope with a good crowd.  Not so with the Blue Adobe.  Waiter was slow getting to our table to greet us, very slow.  Since he was so slow we decided to order drinks and dinner at the same time for fear that once our drinks would arrive we might never see him again.  Once ordered the food took almost 40 minutes to arrive, three of our orders anyway.  God knows where the fourth order was.  One of the three that arrived was the wrong order, so it had to go back.  15 minutes later the correct 3rd order arrived, but the 4th was still nowhere to be found.  After another 15 minutes, the 4th order, mine, came out.  The food was well presented, but the veggies on the plate were cold and the chicken was possibly the driest, toughest, most overdone piece of chicken breast I have ever had the misfortune of eating.  I ate about half and decided it was just nor worthy of being called food and quit eating it.  Once my order did arrive we asked the waiter for the check right away as he was one of the most inattentive waiter in Phoenix.  The check did come out immediately.  Overall a disgusting dining experience.  Will never return.  ON another note, my fellow diners said their food tasted good."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here last night, it was excellent, my husband usually doesn't like Mexican food but he said it was really good.  Had a nice cocktail, we had the chips and salsa while we waited for our dinner.  We had a  chorizo stuffed chicken and could have not been more happy!  Service was good and they are very friendly."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and very friendly. The guacamole lacked flavor but I've become used to table side vs pre-made. 

We had the chorizo stuffed chicken and the Tucamari. Both were excellent quality, served with veggies sautéed in wine and a green chile potato. The chicken was served with mushroom almandine sauce. I love mushrooms and almond flavors but, apparently not do much on chicken. Just a personal preference and nothing against the restaurant itself. 

The Tucamari was tender and flavorful but would probably try something else if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of New Mexico style food, Carne Adovada being one of my favorite. I kept reading \"best authentic new mexican\" in the reviews. I couldn't disagree more. The food has an extremely heavy gringo influence for the worst. Could not serve this anywhere in New Mexico. I have never had Carne Adovada with pork that was dry and tough. As a cook, my guess is the pork was made days ahead of time and reheated (poorly). Then to make things worse, the adovada sauce had a distinct charred / burned taste to it. Cheese crisp had no crisp and was soggy instead. This is authentic to where I don't know other than here.

Not sure where all the great reviews are coming from. The only thing I can guess based on the crowd was that they have a lot of very loyal customers that are of the retirement age (or older)  and have been going there for years. Certainly nothing wrong with that. 

They had a full dining room with only 3 servers and one bus person and service was slow at best. I don't blame the servers as it was apparent that they were completely overwhelmed and doing the best they were allowed to do. Servers were even making the drinks/cocktails/margaritas for their tables. Wanted so much to like this place, but it was simply not a good experience. The owner / manager even came by and took our menus before we even ordered and without ever asking if we were done with them. In fact she never said a word to us. No one ever came by to ask how the meal was or to refill drinks.

They did take the uneaten Carne Adovada off the bill, thank goodness. Definitely won't ever be back."}
{"text":"One of the most delightful dining experiences. From the appetizer to the main course to the dessert to the Overall service. 

I had the Taos Combo (Honey smoked pork tamale, tenderloin relleno and shrimp enchilada). The tamale was the highlight with the WONDERFUL smoky taste and the moist masa the tamale was made of. The salsa and enchilada sauce had a full flavor with just the right HOT kick. The Triple Dipper was the best combination of guacamole, beans with pico de gallo & sour cream, and the highlight was the lobster dip with roasted Anaheim green chile. Dessert was a perfectly fried sopapilla stuffed with ice cream and apples, all topped with powdered sugar & honey.....a Mexican/American apple pie of sorts. 

Our waiter, Eric, was OUTSTANDING. Friendly and attentive service. Our tostada chip bowl and glasses of iced tea NEVER went below half empty. 

We will definitely RETURN.........soon!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is atrocious (pray you don't get served by the curly blonde). Likely never setting foot in restaurant again as food took forever and server never acknowledged."}
{"text":"Being from southwestern Colorado my father in law was looking for a place to get some carne adovada in Phoenix. I google carne adovada and blue Adobe grill and another place came up. I talked my father in law into blue Adobe as it was only 15 minutes from out condo in Scottsdale. We decided to get a taste of it as the reviews said how amazing it was, well needless to say the meat was cooked well but the flavoring was nothing to write home about. I may be completely bias as the area I live in and family members make amazing adovada. If it was even half way worth eating I would have given it a 4 star. My father in law ended up ordering posole of which he let the bowl half full, my wife ordered pasta of which she took one bite of, my brother in law ordered a cheese quesadilla, and I ordered a cheese enchilada and a chili relleno. My food was ok but the red sauce could use some work not very flavorful. I had to take them to five guys afterwards so they could eat dinner. Margaritas that my wife and sister in law had were great. I feel bad for the server as she did a great job and raved that they were well know for their adovada, but we will defiantly pass next time."}
{"text":"We drove 20 miles to try this place... IT WAS GREAT! Friendly staff and great food! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food is different than the usual Mexican establishments. Food is definitely more spicier than other places. Their pecan smoked grilled shrimp is always good."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while visiting AZ for the first time ever.  The food here was SO DELICIOUS!    The queso was hands down the best we've ever had! (Everything was great--in fact, we ate until we were sick because it was SO good we just couldn't put our forks down my hand to God, that's the truth!)  Our server was so nice and very attentive even though he was super busy.  The place was clean, the people were friendly, the food was wonderful and to those of you who live close enough to visit often, I am quite jealous!  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I'm in heaven.... this is the Mexican food that I crave. I have eaten here almost every time I have been to Phoenix for the last 10 years, and even turned on a local from Gallup to this joint. They have mastered the ancho, nothing else to say. Some people may not appreciate the subtleties of this chili, but if the masses knew about it we would never be able to get a seat.

Not for everyone but if you try it, you will probably be back again & again."}
{"text":"Extremely over priced for what it is,  guess I'm just not a huge fan of New Mexico  style food when it costs 3 times more than traditional Mexican food.   I'll take my taco on a yellow corn tortilla for a buck or 2 across the street at Salsitas,  instead of on blue corn for double the price"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this restaurant, I just had to try it. The decoration inside is very nice and is much better than the white exterior. Kudos to the designer for such a drab building.

The food was a C. The salsa, guacamole and a lobster green chili dip are all must haves! Terrific flavors. The crab cake is boring and doesn't have much taste. The sauce on top of it though is good and has a nice little kick. The shrimp...excellent. That's by themselves or in an enchilada! Great flavor. 

The blue seafood enchilada is ok. The halibut is sparse, tortilla dry and salmon overbearing. The shrimp though saved the dish...See, I told you the shrimp dishes were the best. 

The Taos Trio was ok as well. It could have been better if it didn't sit out for 20 minutes before being reheated because they forgot one of our dishes.  The pork tamale was decent. The red sauce overpowered the tamale, but that could have been from soaking on too for so long before service. The tenderloin relleno would have been great if delivered on time. Unfortunately, it was soggy and therefore was a C-. It could have been an A though! The best part of the Taos, you got it, the shrimp enchilada. Very good!!! Even overdone. 

Overall, decent New New Mexican food. I should have gone with the stacked enchiladas!!  It could be a 3-star Mexican restaurant, but gets a 2 this time due to the delayed service and over-cooked food. May have to try again to certify proper ranking."}
{"text":"Never never does me wrong; Muchas Gracias B.A.G! Great favor! You have to try this place. Live in Hollywood,CA and this place would kill it in L.A.! Customer since 2007."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were pretty good.  The price was quite reasonable.   The service was good for the most part.  However,  two in our group asked for special requests on their order which were accepted by the server but not followed through with by the kitchen.  Someone also ordered a side of vegetables, which were brought out 5 minutes before the meal.  I would go back if I were in that area,  but would not make a special trip."}
{"text":"Was looking for a Mexican restaurant near  Sun Devil Liquors. Had a side of guac with the chips and salsa and it was awesome. Salsa is really good too with moderate heat. Had the Santa Cafe 3 item sampler with a tamale , chicken enchilada and carne adovada. All were out of this world. The margaritas were superior as well. Best Mexican food I've had for some time and I fashion myself an aficionado."}
{"text":"Parking was a breeze and so was being seated. I took a seat at the bar and ordered a margarita on the rocks - hold the salt, please. Chips and some kind of thick chipotle salsa came out. Good stuff. I ordered the green chili corn chowder and tacos.  The salsa for the chips has a little kick to it.  Nothing outrageous it's packed with flavor though.  The green chile corn chowder was slamming!  So was the green chile sauce. It had pieces of green chiles in it and was served warm for my tacos (one beef one chicken).

Definitely coming back here the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"The Blue Adobe Grille is amazing, everything I have ever ordered has been awesome. The meatloaf is probably the best thing on their menu, but their vegetarian options are also very good."}
{"text":"We had margaritas (strawberry, pomegranate, and prickly pear), salmon wrap, stacked green chile chicken enchiladas, salsa and colorful chips. Prices were very reasonable. Margaritas were were great. Food was definitely worth coming back for! Salsa was different (maybe typical for NM?) but still very good."}
{"text":"Wow... what can I say... so deliriously good. We had some very good margaritas and then the calimari steak appitizer.  Wow. Divine! Tender and the sauce had a good kick to it. Loved it. I ordered the layered enchiladas. .. with the egg... christmas style. Awesome! My husband had the pork ribs. Fall. Off. The. Bone. Great!! If we lived here, we would be regulars... enjoy!"}
{"text":"We randomly picked this place because of the location and were pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere and food! When we travel to Arizona or New Mexico we always try to eat our weight in Mexican food as where we are in Seattle, it's slim pickins! We always judge by chips and salsa because that is the mark of a good restaurant to us. And the chips and salsa were delicious! So was the food! And margaritas! We also indulged in the sopapillas which were good too! It was a little busy for a Tuesday night, so a reservation may be a good idea! Worth a stop for some good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Stood at the door waiting to be seated for 5 minutes without being recognized by a single employee. Left and decided to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great Place! The food was like a fine restaurant in Taos! I had the Taos Combo Honey Smoked Pork Tamale, Tenderloin Relleno & Shrimp Enchilada for 16.95. Awesome! Rustic and tasty! They server was very good! We went to the Roaring Fork the night before and the food was not that good and cost 2 times more than B/A and I was treated to an undercooked piece of chicken! :oP Go if you have the chance! Don't forget the Sopapillas! We had 10 people and the service was great.
 As for the one star ratings. You can't drop a single star rating an then say the food is great. To me 90% of a rating is the food. Scottsdale location was Awesome as well! went there 2 nights in a row. Places have off nights it happens. If you say the food was great but you will never go again seems like your a bit high maintenance. Get over it!"}
{"text":"When you drive up to it ur unsure what to think. Dont let it scare you. The food is amazing. I loved the carne adovada. You can get it in red or green sauce. I got half and half. The chorizo stuffed chicken was also amazing. Went on a sunday. They have 10 dollar specials. A must go!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service was good.  Atmosphere is robust. Plenty of parking.  I'm from Boston.  Been here a few times now."}
{"text":"This my favorite Mexican restaurant in town!  Hatch Catch was awesome as was the Spooning replenish. You should definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Great food! Great flavors! Great service! Loved everything except the guacamole... it was a little bland... but will be coming back ... family and I determined this is the new favorite! Stacked enchiladas rocked! Great portions! Try the tenderloin! Would be 5 stars but I think they really dropped the ball with the guac."}
{"text":"If you want New Mexican Food this is as good as it gets. I can not recall in all of my trips ever having a bad experience or bad food. The Adovada is the best ive ever had with either green or red sauce. Ive also had salads, the salmon, chimi's and serveral other dishes. Everything was great and better than most other places in town. Usually a resturant has one or two really good things on the menu - this place make it very hard to decide because its all good. Even the beans taste better here. And dont forget the drinks - marguritas are good, Sangria is always on the menu, Ive yet to find a place that compares.

Food is Superb
Service is Great
Atmosphere is Great"}
{"text":"awesome food!!! awesome atmosphere!!!  best pumpkin martinis by Vicki! Great prices!!"}
{"text":"Very flavorful food.  I had the shacked enchiladas and they were excellent!  The only thing that I did not care for was the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"This place was beyond fantastic. I've been trying to find an authentic southwestern place for a few months and this was it. The fire roasted salsa and guacamole and was fresh and tasted great (the salsa can be a little spicy for those who are sensitive). I had the stacked enchiladas with green chile: amazing. The meat was prepared perfectly, the dish had the right amount of green chile and cheese. Even the rice was awesome. Also had prickly pear margs that were to die for. Our waiter was polite, attentive and had great suggestions. Drinks were constantly refilled. The atmosphere was casual, they had 90s music playing, but I went in a dress and did not feel overdressed in the slightest. This will definitely become a go to for date night."}
{"text":"Love this place! One of the best tamales I've ever had. Same goes for the chile relleno.  Delicious food all around. The salsa is different than most. Dark and smokier. The margaritas get an A in my book, also! Service is always good and fast. I wish it was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Cut to the chase: we were lucky and came early on a Wednesday, so the recommended reservations weren't needed, but you can absolutely see why they are. The chorizo stuffed chicken was out of this world; if it's any indication of what the rest of the menu is like, you can see how this place would be churning on Friday and Saturday nights. They're close by the Cubs' spring training home at Hohokam, so it was a quick drive there from the park.

The photo is wrong; the place has been painted a deep cerulean blue."}
{"text":"Downtown Mesa has an old time appeal all its own. There are some places that I would never venture to visit ever again, and there are those gems that make me think twice about my predisposition to dismiss any dining establishment within the general area.

The Adobe Grille is the latter.

I can't even begin to tell you how many times we have driven past this place throughout the decades. The blue and white exterior seemed so unappealing, but it was hiding the treasure of great cuisine, within.

Neither my wife, nor I had any plans for Cinco De Mayo, so this was an impromptu visit. She wanted to venture out and find a place that we haven't partaken of in the past. Plus, she really wanted to give this place a try before dismissing it as another hole in the wall that isn't worth our attention.

As we walked in, I was immediately concerned with the many patrons occupying the tiny foyer. This didn't look good at all. The hostess tried to be as cheerful as possible, but seemed a little overwhelmed by the busyness and the crowd.

I gave her my name, the number in my party (2), and we proceeded to sit outside to enjoy the weather; as well as, to avoid the stuffed sardines of a crowd in the foyer.

Not too long afterwards, we were seated at a table by the front door. 

Austin, our server, promptly introduced himself and explained the details of their menu since we introduced ourselves as being first-timers.

My wife ordered their Chimilada combo, which was a combination of a beef chimichanga, and a mushroom enchilada. I had the chorizo stuffed chicken. We also ordered the Family Sopapillas, for good measure.

It took a little bit to get our order, but the Chips with the wonderfully prepared salsa helped us passed the time away, even though we were quite famished.

When our food arrived, our initial samplings of our own as well as each other's dishes were wonderful surprises to our senses - especially, our palates.

My stuffed chicken dish was amazingly well prepared, and the chorizo within was spicy and flavorful. My wife was  also delighted with her dish. The mushroom enchilada had a slightly nutty taste to the mushrooms and the accompanying mushroom sauce. The chimichanga was well prepared and included a green sauce that didn't overpower the flavor. 

The sopapillas were scrumptious as well. They were the flat style, with powdered sugar. Austin also gave us a bottle of honey to enjoy them with. 

To top it all off, Austin's prompt service made for a delightful dining experience."}
{"text":"11/13/2017
Gained a star, now four. We had the full rack of ribs and they were fantastic. I had the ancho salmon and boy was it good!  Service was a little slow on a Monday nite but if it had been better I would have awarded 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my meal last night. I ordered the ancho rubbed ribs after our waitress gushed on about how amazing they were....\"meaty and fall off the bone tender\".  They were anything but.  The first bite I was unable to even chew, it was so hard and dry. The table knife provided was not sharp enough to separate the ribs. When I shared this with our waitress when she checked in with our table she said she was sorry and surprised as she had only heard good things about the ribs.  She willingly brought me a steak knife so that I could try cut  an individual rib. I'm not very assertive-I've never sent a meal back. I sure wish the waitress would have offered. I ended up eating just one rib and giving up.  To be honest, they tasted as if they had been warmed up from a previous day. That would explain the dryness. SO disappointing as I normally love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Its good! I want to go back and try more! It not your traditional Mexican place which is why I am looking forward to trying it again. My kids loved it too"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The sauces are spicy so make sure to ask for none if you don't like spicy food."}
{"text":"Nice change. 

I knew I would enjoy the food when they brought out fresh, unique, and spicy salsa. Yummy. 

I was not overly thrilled with the lobster queso appetizer, but it was all forgiven with dinner. I had the chimichilada. A mini chimi and shredded beef enchilada. The enchilada had an amaretto sauce with mushrooms that was delicious and one of a kind. Not a traditional sauce, but one you have to try. 

I want to try the rellenos next time. They looked great. We shared a seasonal pumpkin creme brulee.

Prices were reasonable. Service good. Dont go here if you are looking for standard/routine mexican fare (atmosphere is more like a pub than a mexican food joint)...but do go here for a delightful mexican experience and good mexican food."}
{"text":"We discovered this place last year and LOVE the atmosphere. Modern Mexican American combo. The patio is great and has an outdoor bar also. They have cool live music too. The service has always been good as well. They know their stuff because it is a unique style of Mexican food called \"New Mexico\" so we often have questions and the staff is helpful. The salsa is great and the food I've tried is also good- unique but good. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. It's a little spendy drink wise for what you get."}
{"text":"I ordered the Land of Enchantment plate deciding that the pecan grill might satisfy my cravings for a properly grilled steak.  I was very happy with the proteins, the prawns and steak were both cooked very well, and were both seasoned expertly.  My only real issue with the meal was that the potatoes were ice cold and that the vegetables seemed very out of place, almost tossed haphazardly on the plate to complete the dish.  My plate also felt very cold, so I imagine the timings just weren't right in the kitchen.  The service was excellent though, and the atmosphere of the place was great."}
{"text":"The food was OK not great. From the time we sat down till we received our food was 49 minutes. Overall average food and too Long a wait for our food. 

The waiter was good but the kitchen staff let the ball drop."}
{"text":"A different restaurant.... not foods from Mexico, but foods from New Mexico! Grab your taste buds and napkins to eat the Blue Adobe Burger. Great flavor. Would order again, but dont like the large chunks of chilies. Fries are crispy. Didn't order the other NM cuisine and would recommend this restaurant for groups or couples. Enjoyed... but remember.... everyone is a critic. Try for yourself and be surprised. Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"Had an incredible meal at the Blue Adobe! Service was a bit slow at first, but our meals hit the table before we could even finish the chips and (YUMMY) salsa! I had the meatloaf special, and it was outstanding- the loaf itself was delicious, but the sauce really took it to the next level! Not to mention one of the best potato pancakes I've ever had! My boyfriend had the chimichanga and barely came up for air between bites. I also had a Prickly Pear marg, and they definitely did not skimp on the tequila. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Their queso blanco starter was really good. The stack enchiladas were also good, but the stuffed chiles were lacking seasoning and proper way of cooking those is to take the skin off...not impressed. I tried their Creme Brûlée because it's one of my 2 favorite desserts...was disappointed by the cold baby food consistency under burned sugar. Would like to come back and try their homemade cheesecake and another stacked enchiladas plate."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places I have eaten in a long time.  Ordered the Christmas Carne Adovada  and it was so good I came back two days later for more.  Everything was great about this place.  It's a must if your in the area!!"}
{"text":"We were craving for New Mexican food, particularly Dick's Hideaway, but I remembered previewing the menu at Blue Adobe Grill and seeing that they offered similar dishes at a more affordable price. Also, being that it's in Mesa (we're in Chandler) it seemed like a great time to give this restaurant a try. 

The BF ordered the shredded beef enchiladas, christmas style and added a fried egg on top. I had one of the specials where you can pick two or three items for a set price. I chose the carne adovada (what I was craving) and a garden enchilada christmas style. Both dishes came with rice and beans. 

The verdict:

Carne Adovada: Tender and flavorful. Good, but I prefer Dick's. 

Garden Echiladas: Sucked. Filled with shredded carrots & zuchinnis. Menu stated mushrooms, but I didn't really see or taste any. Green sauce was really spicy. Too spicy for me. Red sauce was better, still spicy but not that much better. 

Shredded Beef Enchiladas: Really good. I enjoyed this the most, well the red sauce side. Something I noticed was this red sauce tasted better than the red sauce on my garden enchilada. Suppose to be the same, I think. 

Rice and Beans: Blah. I barely touched this. Rice was okay I guess but beans didn;t really suit my taste.

All in all. 3 stars, A-OK. Pretty much all I have to say. I wouldn't suggest coming here but wouldn't mind going if someone else suggested it."}
{"text":"If you driven by this place and haven't stopped to try it out you have missed an opportunity to eat some of the best adobada around. Absolutely incredible and a beautiful dining experience. Been here quite a few times and always recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Having arranged our large group in advance, we were given 1/2 the space we needed, the restaurant itself was uncomfortably warm, and the service was awful - to put it nicely.

After not being allowed to sit at one of the four open tables, several of us sat at the bar next to other patrons (not with our group) who were drinking and eating. When we mentioned to the bartender, whose attention it took almost 15 minutes to get, that we would like to order, he was clearly put out at the prospect of having to deal with it.

A few minutes later when I asked for a glass of ice water, the bartender said \"NO. Not at the BAR\". 

When our food came, it was delicious (although one of the orders was wrong).

In general the entire staff at the restaurant seemed put upon by our group.

It's a shame, really, because the food was delicious. Pretty sure I won't be returning to Blue Adobe Grill."}
{"text":"Well, for our first time there we were impressed. We have been in NM before so we love the green chile. The food was amazing and our margaritas we very good and tasty. We sat outside because it was a nice day. Love this place. Will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"The blue Adobe is always a favorite when we head out to Mesa for a concert.   The food and drinks are top notch.  Very different from the standard Mexican fair.   Coming soon Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"The only reason we went here twice was because the first time I forgot my groupon.  I had the tenderloin Caesar wrap. I don't remember what I had the first time. I really didn't care for either dish. The flavors were just not to my liking. I'm more of a comfort food type. My husband had the steak the first time and the enchiladas this time. He wasn't overly impressed with either dish.   I wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had the same dish both times because it is so delicious. I'm sure everything else is amazing but I don't know if I'll ever make it past the Carne Adovada, delicious tender pork in a red adobo sauce. My husband has a similar problem with the stacked enchiladas (Christmas style with red and green sauce), it's the only dish he's had in his three visits. Be careful not to completely gorge yourself on the complimentary chips and salsa (which is roasted to perfection, and good enough to drink), as the portions are generous. The restaurant seems to walk the line between fancy and casual. Great date night spot!"}
{"text":"The series of 1 star reviews below is unfair, they place only has like 30 chairs in it total, in order to serve 30 people at one sitting, they would have to close the restaurant down.  I wish there was a civil service requirement where everyone would have to work in a restaurant.  The fact that these people assume they are the judges of east valley taste is ridiculous, I would hate to be around a table of 30 people all scheming to write bad reviews of the place their still in...

Enough ranting.  The service here is very nice, the staff knows the place backwards and forwards and the decor is well kept and very Northern New Mexican.  It's a little disconcerting from the outside, par for many great places in Mesa.

The food is spectacular.  This is food that it takes time to make.  Pecan wood smoked shrimp, pork abodova all take time and good ingredients to get right.

We did it right here.  Had the New Mexican Corn Chowder to start, creamy and delicious.  Margaritas are huge and very good.

For dinner I had the Taos platter, Tenderloin Rejeno, Shrimp Enchilada and smoked pork tamale.  All of which were great.  I am a huge eater and could not finish my plate.

We did have room for a glass of port, nice liquor selection btw and an order of their banana creme brule which was a nice end to a nice meal.

Great place, great way to ditch the sonoran mexican food blues.  Unless you like Sonoran cheese and grease on a plate.  These chips and salsa were great, verde salsa and multicolored corn chips.  Yes!

Oh yeah, also very affordable, no dish is over $20, including the great steak my gf had."}
{"text":"Very cool place -- friends of ours introduced us to this place and it has some of the best new mexican food I've tasted.  Love it!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and enjoyed it.  I had the Santa Cafe with shrimp tacos and garden enchilada.  It was very good and the portions were good, although there were just a few small shrimp in the tacos.  My husband had the chip chop salad with chicken which he enjoyed.  The grilled chicken had great flavor and the salad was huge.
The woman next to us had ordered sopapilla and she said they were the best around.  We were too full to order dessert!  I would go back.
As another reviewer mentioned, don't be put off by the looks of the restaurant from the outside.  Inside was really nice and the food and service were very good."}
{"text":"Buried deep in the heart, or the seedy underbelly, of increasingly barren Country Club Drive is a re-purposed chalet-type building that houses the best New Mexico style cuisine this side of the Santa Fe divide. In town for a conference, we had heard positive whispers, and we were rewarded with fiery adobe salsa, dark and rich, with our chips, a peerless pulled pork adobo sandwich which was outrageously delicious, pecan grilled chicken that was moist and flavorful, and all of it popped. The parking lot fills astoundingly quickly as the smart business folk along this corridor pile in as if on cue, but the servers are used to the rush and the staff doesn't hesitate to educate newcomers. Would that they would franchise themselves to Tucson..."}
{"text":"Excellent chile rellenos, tamales, and enchiladas. Great chips and salsa. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Anytime we have out of town guests who need to try Southwestern cuisine, we bring them here. I love their chips and salsa. Tamales are a favorite. =)"}
{"text":"I had to give it five stars b/c my husband thinks he had one of the best pizza's there ever!  He had the Garlic Shrimp Pizza with chipolte shrimp, pesto and garlic.  He is a big garlic fan and he believes it was spot on in flavor and couldn't get enough of it.  I had a chipolte shrimp caesar wrap special with mango and I, too, thought it was quite tasty.  It had a very unique flavor mixture.

Our chips and salsa was also good - though I would have liked if they had a little spicier of a salsa.  Overall - a great find before Spring training."}
{"text":"Nice, classy atmosphere. The food is very tasty. I especially like the Green Chicken Enchilada (with a fried egg on top.)"}
{"text":"I came here based on great Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. It was pretty busy and I took a seat at the bar, promptly being served their fun chips and salsa app. I took advantage of their happy hour specials and got the house margarita--perfect! I was so torn between 2 entrees, but the owner (or manager, I could tell she was in charge) said I was able to order portions of both for my entrée. Talk about best of both worlds! They really take traditional dishes and put their own spin on it. The food was so fresh and flavorful! The restaurant seemed short-staffed when I was there, but the bartender was so polite and constantly smiling despite running all over the place for the hour and a half I was there. They truly have quality people working for them. I can't wait to return next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"We used to live near the Scottsdale location and loved it.  This one may be even better! Their salsa is our favorite and everything we've ever gotten is so tasty. The enchiladas, pizzas, corn chowder, and burgers are tops for us. Service always great too."}
{"text":"Updating my review... 
I come here at least once a month with colleagues because we work right up the street. I decided to bring the family for lunch on a Saturday. My stacked enchiladas were dry and the chicken tasted old. 

Our five year old ordered a bean and cheese burrito. When the food came out we realized the burrito was filled with whole beans, which was a problem. He didn't touch anything on his plate and had a slice of his brother's pizza while we waited for the server to return. And waited. And waited. 

When he returned three of us were 80% finished with our food and all of our drinks were completely empty. I told him about the bean issue and he asked if we wanted something else and I told him it was too late. 

The bill came out with the $5 bean burrito still on it. I asked if it was an oversight and he made a pretty big deal about it and embarrassed me.  I told him for future reference most little kids don't like whole beans and are pretty particular about their food so he may want to mention it (parents, can you vouche??). He said he'd never run into this issue before. He ended up taking the bean burrito off comma I don't know that I will return."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place is in such a weird area! The food is so fabulous and it is tucked far away from any sort of public recognition. I suppose that is better for me selfishly because then the line will stay down when dinner time arrives. I came here a few months ago so pardon my lack of memory on exact menu items. But I still remember that salsa was spicy and gorgeously amazing. I am a food adrenaline junky so any time a restaurant has a unique enough menu for me to even waste my time with is an amazing feat. I ordered some sort of lobster and seafood enchilada with a mango raspberry chipotle sauce. It was flavorful and  didn't make me feel like I was eating unhealthy and ridiculously rich.  When I go back to visit my grandparents in Mesa I certainly plan on going back here over and over and over again!"}
{"text":"I am visiting and was recommended this place. It was
Pretty good. I though the service could have been better. Overall, it is good and I would
Go again but not overly excited to rave about it
Here on yelp."}
{"text":"Went there on a recent vacation (2 weeks ago) and already forgotten anything about the atmosphere, service or what the other people with me ate or thought about it - so that puts it at an average for me. I do remember (after a quick glance at the menu) what I got - the double-stacked enchiladas, Christmas style - and it was just fine, but nothing I would've ordered again or complained about - just average."}
{"text":"After a recent trip to New Mexico, I have to say that this food is very much authentic New Mexican cuisine. The flavors are all there, and they don't cut corners. When the menu says green chilies, you actually get Hatch chilies and not Anaheim peppers (unlike many restaurants outside of the Rio Grande Valley). The menu isn't large, but it has many categories to suit anyone's preference and hits all the right notes (and your wallet will think so, too). The fare is anything but ordinary in true New Mexican fashion, from burgers to enchiladas and rellenos, to seafood, pork, beef, and chicken plate dinners, pizza, pasta, and salads. I highly recommend the chorizo stuffed pecan-grilled chicken with red pepper mashed potatoes (served stuffed in a Hatch chili!). Pecan grilling is found on many menu items and it an integral part of the flavor profile of New Mexico, giving meats a nice sweet, smokey flavor. The margaritas good sized and priced well, and are well-balanced (not too sugar-y or syrup-y). They even offer a prickly pear margarita, which is my personal favorite. The atmosphere is very comfortable and well decorated and is furnished more like a cozy lodge than a restaurant. The bar also has flat screen TVs for sports fans. Any time I have eaten here, the staff have been super-friendly and conversational. In short, I would say that if you're looking for something tasty and different to feed your Foodie side, check out the Blue Adobe on Country Club. Small restaurant, big food."}
{"text":"We are visiting from CA and had dinner here last night. The food was really good and fresh! I ordered the Santa Fe plate with two items, the garden enchilada and the salmon taco. The salmon taco was really good, but after my first bite, the entire tortilla fell apart and I ended up eating it with a fork. The flavors were delicious though! The garden enchilada was pretty good too, but there were too many carrots in it. We also ordered the guacamole appetizer, I didn't think it had much flavor so I added salt and pepper to it and it tasted a lot better. The complimentary chips and salsa were really good! Overall a good dining experience!"}
{"text":"Super hungry after a long day and found this spot on Yelp, lots of reviews and a great rating so we went for it. Oh no, we got the bummer server! He was absolutely not interested in any kind of conversating. Very fast at everything he did, but a blank stare otherwise while he waited for us to place an order. We got a 1/2 carafe of margaritas which he dropped at the table with a shot of something next to it. \"What is that?\" we wondered...turned out to be the do-it-yourself Grand Marnier float after we asked his next trip around. The food was OK. Shared a chimichanga (which was not served with the caramelized onions or sour cream mentioned on the menu) as well as the garden enchiladas (flavorless, carrot-full and boo.) We chowed everything down quickly and hungrily but what a disappointment as we were hoping to stumble across something memorable and fun. I guess part of the excitement of being new to the area is taking a number of shots in the dark until you find something good. Cheers to the Yelp check-in free guacamole but we were too busy getting through our meal to discuss ever returning."}
{"text":"Wonderful surprise--inside is much nicer than it looks from the outside. Food is delicious & Great service!!"}
{"text":"I go to the one on Country Club near Main, in Mesa....The is New Mex food. Made with great care. Stacked enchiladas are awesome with an egg on top., or \"Spooning Rellenos\" stuffed with your fave are to die for. MY fave is the beef tenderloin in one, and  Adovado pork in the other. Service is always great for me.Prices are better than avg, for the quality of the food.The have a full service bar.Comfortable atmosphere. Sometimes, I just make excuses to be in that neighborhood, just so I can go to Blue Adobe!"}
{"text":"Our server Jordan was awesome and the happy hour is great - everyday from 3-6:30. Doesn't get much better than that, especially after work. I had the spooning rellenos with extra green chile and will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! I think it may be the best New Mexican food I have had! Great service also!"}
{"text":"It is important to point out that Blue Adobe Grill is not a Mexican restaurant, it is a New Mexican restaurant. While that may seem to be an unnecessary clarification, it is actually fairly important to keep in mind as you visit. 

For a New Mexican joint, it is pretty dang good and true to the region, but food a sit-down Mexican joint it would be disappointing. In order to maintain full disclosure, it has been a couple of years since I went here last, but it has been around for years so I can't imagine much has changed. Overall I would recommend it to people who don't have expectations of a certain type of food. It's good but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in its price range.  The mushroom enchiladas are amazing and you absolutely can't go wrong with the pick three combos. The food is rich and satisfying, the staff is friendly and helpful, and ambiance is modern and comfortable. Much love Blue Adobe :)"}
{"text":"Continues to be the best new mexican in tow for northern new mexican style food. Kind of an upscale arribas.  Love both places."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place. No surprise, you'll need reservations at dinner time. Not at lunchtime, but still crowded - - because the food and service is so good.  I must confess that I have only had the same dish the three times I have been there:

\"Carne Adovada    $12
Pork Roast simmered in house seasonings and immersed in our Red Chile Adobo Sauce. Cilantro Garnish & Flour Tortilla.\"

It is just so good that I dream of going back for the same meal.  My wife and two of my buddies came with me on different occasions and all liked their entries very much, so I am writing a \"group review.\"

They have a homemade salsa that is outstanding, and you can purchase a pint of it in a jar.

BTW, it is not typical Mexican food they serve, but a Southwestern, New-Mexican cuisine.  There is overlap, but a difference in entrees and spices.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  A little spicy for my taste so be careful what you order but it had unique flavors and we all liked it a lot.  Service was also excellent."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in the valley.  I have had 10 different dishes here and love them all.  To start-the salsa is amazing and unique.  Some of my fav dishes include carne anovada, shrimp cocktail relleno, chipotle pasta, meatloaf and their fab posole."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! I love this place, the jalapeno bearnaise sauce is soo food as well as the green chilie corn chowder."}
{"text":"This was a very, very lucky find.  We were heading to Mesa for a meeting that ended around 5 and knew we would be ready for a \"beverage\" and wanted to find a local watering hole with good food.  WOW, did we score!  This place is not a chain (we love that), understated (we love that), has a funky vibe (we love that), excellent first contact at the door (we love that) and it smelled really, really good when we walked in, (yeah, we love that too).  We gravitated to the margaritas.  Ordered a half carafe of 'ritas with a Grand Marnier floater, excellent.  Mulit colored corn chips and a smokey mole style salsa arrived.  Spot on.  We started with the lobster dip and crispy fried flour tortillas.  Amazing!  The menu ranged from tacos to tenderloin with blue crab.  Wife got the Thursday special chorizo stuffed chicken breast with steamed veggies, and a half chili filled with sweet potato for $10.  Deal!  I went for the tenderloin steak topped with blue crab, asparagus, and an amazing pasta with a slightly spicy sauce.  $20.  Perfect!  The menu and food preparation and presentation have a gourmet vibe while at the same time it is a very laid back atmosphere. You can get a Corona and taco or, go for it with deluxe 'ritas and tenderloin steak.  Our kinda' place, for sure.  Prices are just right.  Like I said before we felt like we just discovered our new favorite restaurant.  It is 45 minutes from where we live, but we will be back!   We love it!  Sorry if I got a bit cheesy with \"love it\".....ha.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Stopped in after touring Taliesin West.  Great, great SW food.  Tuesday Taco special was really good -- good price and lovely flavors.  Margarita was excellent also.  Good for a quick bite to eat.  My husband had one of the plate specials and was too much for him to eat!"}
{"text":"The salsa is great and very different to regular restaurant salsa. I had the chorizo egg burro. It wasn't huge but it was delicious."}
{"text":"MAKE A RESERVATION! My hubby and I went on a Thursday night not expecting a wait. We are from out of town and didn't know how busy this place can get. From what we heard, this is typical all over Mesa/surrounding area. We were told 30 minutes and 45 minutes later, we were seated. After having lived in Albuquerque before, I was so excited at the prospect of authentic New Mexican carne adovada! Our server was friendly and attentive but my carne tasted nothing like NM carne adovada. While I recognize AZ isn't NM, I can make it more authentic tasting with my Hatch chilies I have shipped to me in Oregon. This place touts itself as New Mexican and frankly, it's not. It's not bad but it's not New Mexican. If I lived there; I'd make the drive back to Albuquerque for the real thing. Don't get me wrong...the food isn't bad at all it's just not the real thing."}
{"text":"Even though this place only dedicates about five hours, one day a week to its breakfast, I think this might be my favorite breakfast place. Literally everything I have tried on the menu has been simply wonderful. My favorite is the eggs benedict. Too much yum.... Maybe one day I will come here when is not 9 am on a Sunday and do some more menu exploring :D"}
{"text":"Brought family in and glad we did. Very nice decor and atmosphere. Service was great, quick and extremely friendly. Meal started with complimentary chips and salsa. We loved their salsa that has a roasted flavor to it and a nice kick!  Wife had seafood enchilada and loved them. I tried a mix plate that included carne adovado, shrimp enchilada and seafood enchilada. All three were perfect. Children really enjoyed their lazy taco's, salmon wrap and cheese crisp. All 5 of us were raving about the food. Nicely done!!"}
{"text":"Ok Date Night

We stopped in here for a dinner date one night a few years ago. 

The food was alright
Service was good 

Nothing really blew me away or captivated me enough to go back..."}
{"text":"wow, food was as good as it gets...great atmosphere and the wonderful smells hit you as soon as you walk in the door. I don't think you could go wrong with a single thing on the menu."}

B.A.D., did not disappoint.i had the Releno and she had the enchilada plate. Fabulous!.....the service was fantastic! Botyom line is...she loved the service, food and the whole enchilada...."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a bite with the hubby and kid. There were only 2 people there which was great for us because we got the best seat. Ordered the Triple Dipper appetizer and we split the Land of Enchantment meal. Both were DELICIOUS!!! The Lobster dip is so chunky and meaty I couldn't stop eating and I don't even like lobster. I ordered my steak medium and it came out closer to well. The server noticed my face when I cut into it and immediately let her manager know. I've never seen someone move so fast to fix a mistake. I even told her it was ok because my husband likes his well but no she insisted on giving me a medium steak. I was very shocked. The well done one had a nice smokey char to it that was really pleasing. But when the medium steak actually made it to the table, whoa whoa now that was one of the most flavorful steaks I've ever had and it was cooked to perfection. I definitely will be back to try those Lazy Tacos and the Chile Ribs. Thank you for the tasty food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Overall really 3.5 (we need half stars!)

I've been going here for years, very since they had a place in Chandler. I think the Chandler location had better food but I head to BAG about once a year since it is not close anymore.

The food is a large step above the average mexican or southwest place. They have some very creative dishes and they all taste good.

My oly criticism is that they use too much cheese and sauce. It smothers some of the flavors they should be accentuating. If they would lighten up on these they'd gain another star."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Waited one hour for our food only to have it delivered in to go boxes, AFTER we had already paid for it before even receiving it.
We had reservations and asked the server if there would be a problem getting in and out in the hour and he assured us it not be a problem. Obviously they were more concerned with the patrons that came in after us and received their food before us.
Dont waste your time"}
{"text":"6:30 pm Friday night. Sat at the three quarter filled bar and waited until the bartender was finished texting. Ordered a margarita, weak.
Ordered  the Oceanfront seafood dish, $19, one shrimp cut up into pieces, the other was supposed to have crab meat. Terrible, over done with plenty of cheese.

Not worth the gas getting to the place."}

{"text":"I did enjoy this place. The chips and salsa were good and the wait staff was nice. This place gets super loud and I don't know why, it was kinda frustrating. I got the chimichanga, it was good and the beans and rice were fantastic but the chimi was super greasy. It even formed a noticable pool of grease on my place. That was kinda sick but its still tasted good. Blue Adobe is a bit pricey for what it is but I would go back there again."}
{"text":"Our meal here was one of those times when we wished we could have eaten ten times the amount of food.  Our dishes---DH got the Enchantment platter and I got the Spooning Rellenos---were---to be extravagant---sublime!

But let's start with the chips and bowl of salsa that were immediately brought to our table when we were seated.  Is it salsa?  I don't think by the definition---to my thinking, it was more like a puree of delicious, fire-roasted Hatch chilies!  Oh, yum!  The chips were nothing special, but who cared with that tasty green goodness!

We each ordered a glass of wine---reasonably priced.

Then came our entrees, which---as I said earlier---were delicious!  My spooning rellenos were breaded and fried peppers filled with juicy, tender beef, chorizo, and jack and cheddar cheese.  Oh, my!  Accompanied by some delicious pinto beans---not heavily seasoned, but their simpleness were the perfect foil to all the flavors on my plate.  There was also seasoned rice, which I did not eat.  Not a fan of rice---should have traded for extra beans!

DH's platter had  a beautiful and delicious filet---quite large for the well-priced plate---and perfectly cooked to his requested medium rare.  The accompanying shrimp were tasty and again, grilled to perfection.  The chicken enchilada was delicious and the chile potato---oh, wow!  It was half a chile with the innards cleaned out, then potatoes pureed with chiles and carefully piped back into the \"shell\".  Pretty to look at, tasty to the mouth.

Of course, we had no room for dessert.  In fact, we had enough to bring home, which was great, because all in all, Blue Adobe Grill is almost an hour from our house, so sadly, this is going to be a \"special\" restaurant.  But we will be back.  Not only did so many dishes sound delicious on the menu, but when carried out to our fellow diners, we were annoying rubberneckers as they went by!  

I surely hope we find another reason to be down Mesa way!

My edit---I forgot to mention the chile-corn chowder.  TO. DIE. FOR.  I would like to have carried home containers of both the \"salsa\" and chowder home.  I have since learned Blue Adobe has second location closer to us, in Scottsdale.  Can't wait to try---hope it will live up to the original!"}
{"text":"The service was very good, but it is extremely busy on weekends so my brother and I had to sit at the bar, which was really uncomfortable (seating wise), and the table was short and over crowded. The food wasn't great for it being Mexican, but they did have great fish (shrimp).  I doubt I'll be back.."}
{"text":"Best New Mexican food in the Valley! I have tried most of the menu and have yet to dislike anything. The stacked enchiladas are great, I like it Christmas style with an egg. I would also recommend the meatloaf and the burger is outstanding. The salsa is unique and delicious. Respect your server and they will respect you in return which is true of any restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant features New Mexican food and it is very good.  We went there pretty late after a concert and were still made to feel welcome even though it was close to closing time.  The chips and salsa were brought to the table right away and were really good.  The waiter was patient with our questions and difficulty making a choice with so many great sounding options.  We both ended up getting the pulled pork sandwich that came with apple slaw on a bun, crispy onion rings, and french fries.  We were able to substitute the fries for vegetables and they were carrots and zucchini.  The meat was a little less warm than I'd like but the taste was quite good.  We were warned that it was spicy but that's what you would expect in a New Mexican restaurant.  The service was good and attentive.  We did not feel rushed and really enjoyed our meal.  Would definitely go back.  Also noted that they give a discount if you have tickets for a concert that night in Mesa."}
{"text":"I was among the large group several other reviewers mentioned that visited Blue Adobe Grille. The points they made in their reviews were right on the money. Because of that, I'll keep this short and add just a few more.

The one server taking care of the group was hit and miss. He paid attention to some and seemed to ignore others. I was encouraging him to go around the table to take each order but instead would take one at a time back to the kitchen, and ignore others as he was walking away. Not very efficient. Still, he was trying, so I'll give him that. One of the two stars above goes to him.

I shared a chicken quesadilla and bean queso dip appetizer. Nothing complicated, but it WAS good. The plates others had looked appetizing also - when and if they ever got them. That accounts for the second star.

The manager, walked up to me at one point near the end of our visit. I was standing by our assigned 4 tables chatting with another person in our group. In an annoyed voice she said, \"I'm going to have to ask you to not crowd the other tables.\"  I was 3 feet away from the next table - I counted the tiles on the floor just to make sure. Is 3 feet considered crowding?
  
Those three blank stars? Lack of follow-through, lack of service and lack of accountability by the manager."}
{"text":"We were in Mesa for the weekend for a friend's wedding and were staying within walking distance of the downtown area. Contrary to LA, everything is apparently closed on Sundays in Arizona so our dining options seemed limited. Being in the mood for enchiladas, we gave Blue Adobe a try with low expectations, having been somewhat disappointed with the food in the area the previous day. I actually remembered walking by Blue Adobe the day before and thinking that it looked like a place I wouldn't be interested in. Blacked out windows, an aging exterior...it just didn't look like the kind of place that had good food to me. But again, options being limited on Sundays...

The cliche is to not judge a book by it's cover, and it holds true here. The decor inside is actually pretty nice and welcoming ... but you came here for the food. I had 2 cheese enchiladas, a beef taco, beans and rice and a margarita. Everything tasted incredible! The beans were way above average (which is a sentence I never expected to write in my lifetime). The rice had a smokey flavor that suggested that they were really MAKING their food, not just doing the same recipes everyone else does. The enchiladas were great and it was all in all a surprising and fantastic meal.

I'd probably have given Blue Adobe a strong 4 stars if it hadn't been for the great service from Allison to push it to 5. Infectious spirit, very attentive and helpful, and a joy to watch work the room. Any time a server delivers your margarita with, \"I'm a terrible bartender because I like drinking too much. Prepare for tingles in about 10 minutes\", then you definitely get another star.

Blue Adobe, I'll see you when next I'm back this way!"}
{"text":"Been two to three times and liked it very much.

Pro's
- chips and salsa really good.  Significantly better than the usual fare
- pulled pork was super!
- atmosphere great

Con's
- servers okay. I wouldn't say overly helpful.  So this was/is a letdown 

I will continue coming here.  Good value!"}
{"text":"I gave Blue Adobe Grille another try on Sun 11/17/13.  This time, they were not nearly as busy, we got seated immediately and the service was great.  The great thing about Sundays is that all the daily specials are available so all three of us ordered from the specials menu at $10 each and as usual, the food was spectacular."}
{"text":"2nd time here and it was just  okay. 
Our server Keefe was polite and provided good service but was spread too thin on this busy Saturday lunch crowd. They didn't seem to have enough staff to fill waters, offer more chips and salsa. We waited so long for everything especially our meals.

Two orders for cheese crisps were ordered and one was so incredible greasy that it needed to be taken away as it made my daughter sick.  She also ordered kids chicken strips and the had an unusual breading and a terrible taste.

We informed our server and he was very apologetic and offered to remove both items from our bill. Just disappointed this time around. The food seemed to be just tossed on plates and the presentabilty was lacking. May give another try as their reviews are very good and maybe were having an off day. However I appreciate consistency and expect the same meal to always be the same."}
{"text":"Service was good, food no, I was expecting a lot more from this establishment, but I did not get it.

salsa and chips  very good as well as the guacamole but that's it....."}
{"text":"In a sea of Mexican Food restaurants this one is a treasure.
It's Santa Fe style cuisine which is a very nice change of pace.
I've been two times and have tried at least 5 different dishes.
The food here is QUALITY! Perhaps one of the best places in the valley. The ingredients taste fresh and the flavors are unique and over the top delicious.

The chile relleno is amazing. The perfect balance of crispy and cheesy.
Their pork adovado is amazing and anything with it is astounding. 
We even took our 3 year old and the typical kid menu of chicken fingers tasted like quality. 

The inside is clean and has some nice decor that's funkier than your average south west or mexican decor. 
Service has always been quick, friendly and very eager to talk about the menu. 

This is the new place for taking out of town guests and family."}
{"text":"The best chili relleno in the valley! Awesome NM style Mexican food! This place is a must!"}
{"text":"This is the first time we've eaten at the Blue Adobe Grill in Mesa, AZ!  Both of our dishes were great!  If you want a light meal, try the lettuce wrap with blackened salmon, so so good!  And the salsa, I don't know how it's made, but one of the best I've ever tasted besides my husband's!  Compliments to the chef & also, to our server, Shawn!  Great Service & Wonderful Tasty food!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very popular. Good tasting. Had pork carne adovada & stacked enchiladas. Both good. Good server. Reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was ok, it's decent but, there was a fly on my food and I talked to the waiter he tried to play it off until i pointed at the staggering fly that i just smacked with my fork. He still was not apologetic and made excuses of where it came from, so I asked for the manager. She is the owner, I guess. I showed her the fly and she picked it up with her fingers and said oh it's coming from the Windows, not the kitchen. I said, oh thank goodness but  now I lost my appetite. Just letting you know that you have flies, my husband just smacked one and now, one is crawling on my carrots,  she said, oh Im sorry (very condescending) I can't control what's in the air and walked away. But, she did give me a $5 Disc, which I really don't care about the money. It's the principle..no hospitality..  Won't be coming back. I Gave them two stars because the waiter was really nice ..Maybe she thought we just wanted a free meal..I hate to play the race card but we were the only black people there, and she treated us like we had the plague.. Party of 5 people and I couldn't finish my meal because I was more disgusted and appalled by her attitude. The fly treated me nicer than this lady. Yes, I was more offended by her than the little fly..  The bill was $93.00 with her discount included.   we didn't come with the intention of getting free food. She was very crass and in denial of the flies...Be aware.."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are excellent. The chilies in their salsa are top notch. Service was great. Loved the prickly pear margarita. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  The salsa is some of the best I've ever had, dark in color with a little heat, it holds up well to the complimentary chips they serve.  I always seem to order the same thing every time, the Spooning Rellenos, beef tenderloin stuffed chile's and always Christmas style with red and green sauce. YUM!  They must have several different chefs, because every time I order this,  it's served just a little different.  I've had the 2 rellenos served one with green and one with red sauce; other times the red/green sauce poured on top of each relleno and other times 1/2 of each covered with a different sauce. Weird - but it still tastes great.

If you come here in during Spring Training, be prepared for a long wait, otherwise I've never had a problem."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Quaint New Mexican, service is good, drinks are great, food amazing."}
{"text":"Only giving it two stars because our server, Allison, was so outstanding!!! Actually, she deserves a full five. The food was extremely disappointing. Our appetizer was the Crab Corn Cakes, tasted of canned crab (more like tuna flavor) and grease. The burger ordered by both my husband and nephew, was a soggy mess. The pizza I ordered claimed to have shrimp and cilantro pesto, but, neither was detected by eye or taste. We were hoping that this could turn into our go to place with such high reviews, unfortunately, I think my personal kitchen could produce far greater results."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Blue Adobe, I have always heard good things about it. I was less than impressed, though all was not bad. There were 5 of us and nobody had ever been. The cheese crisp and lobster green chili cheese dip were VERY good. I order the smoke pork tamale and all I could taste \"chili paste\". It over powered any chance of the smoked pork coming through. My wife have the garden enchilada and was very disappointed in the texture of the dish. Some vegetables were over cooked and some almost raw. 

Our server was very nice but it seemed like each parts of our meal took a long time to get to the table."}
{"text":"I ate at Blue Adobe with my family for my birthday on Sunday.  The service was very slow for one. I usually can be okay with that however when they brought out our food I was handed a dish I did not order. I immediately told the server that this was not what I had ordered and the server proceeded to argue with me stating that I had actually ordered what I did not. I have never had anyone argue with me over such a thing.  It would have made things a whole lot better if the server had simply apologized but no apologie was made by her. Then, when the server found out it was my birthday, a cookie with ice cream was brought out.  The cookie was burnt in the middle (I have no clue how the just the inside was burned) and the burn smell was very aromatic and everyone I was with could smell it. Unfortunately I took a bite before realizing the cookie was basically charcoal on the inside so I left the restaurant with a bad, burnt taste in my mouth. At any rate, horrible service, horrible attitudes by the staff, and gross burned food."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We went for the double stacked red enchiladas and the green chile (and chicken) corn chowder, this time.  Both were excellent!  The waiter was great and took great care of us.  We well be back."}
{"text":"This place is great - food, service, drinks, prices. Our party ordered a huge array of food and everyone raved about their dishes. The drinks were fab with a great beer selection, and our server was on the spot but not hovering and annoying."}
{"text":"I felt like the only Hispanic in the entire place! Lol! I think I was actually! I wouldn't compare it to any other Mexican restaurant. Food was different and super good. It was definitely New Mexican. I'd come back for sure and the staff was very friendly. Just try it and don't be scared"}
{"text":"Very good NM style food. I had the special stacked enchiladas served fast and delicious. Nice charm inside and very good service. I will really go back there again. Good food and good prices."}
{"text":"This place was incredible. I am in town from Chicago. I used to live in AZ and wanted some good TexMex when I was down here. I couldn't have been more pleased. The carne adovada was out of this world, and Allison, who efficiently hosted, waited, and I'm pretty sure managed the place, had time to be witty and funny, and was extremely pleasant. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First and foremost, make sure you make a reservation by calling in advance, then you don't have to wait for a table as this place gets busy.  

Jordan was our waiter and he was great. Super friendly and excellent service. When we ran out of chips he encouraged us to not get another basket based on how large the entree portion sizes are. And he was right! 

The tacos were great! I enjoyed the salmon soft taco and the crab cake soft taco. 

Although they were out of my first choice which was the Lobster Tamale. Guess I will have to go back for that one next time!"}
{"text":"Several of our friends just LOVE this place. But our experience has been just so-so. In fact, similar to Mike W.s. 

We brought our kids -- who are very well-behaved and restaurant savvy I must add -- and the service was cool-to-just plain rude. You would think they would realize a big tip was possible what with us ordering almost $100 in food! 

But noooo... 

Anyway, the food was good, but since I can get pretty defensive when it comes to my kids, I probably won't go here again."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, this place is an amazing find! After my sweetheart's game at Hohokam Field, I used (once again!) my handy-dandy Yelp app to see what was in the area (since I don't know much of anything about Mesa). 

Up pops Blue Adobe Grille. 

So Monday-Saturday they have $10 specials...on Sunday, that $10 will get you any of the specials from Monday-Saturday. 

I ordered the chorizo stuffed chicken (served with delicious red pepper mashed potatoes and steamed veggies). He ordered the stacked enchiladas with beans and rice. Both of the meals were phenomenal, but I think the stacked enchiladas were slightly more phenomenal than what I ordered (grass is always greener on the other side of the table...or something like that?).  Our server was also fantastic and he was johnny-on-the-spot for refilling our beverages. It's also across the street from a pretty cool piano/wine/beer bar (sneakily located in the basement of a liquor store...so cool!) 

It reminds me of home cooking...in the best sense of the words."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, world class rellenos, outstanding carne adovada, almost everything on the menu is excellent.  We eat here a few times each month.  A comfortable, non pretentious restaurant with good food and good service."}
{"text":"I wanted Mexican food. I've been on a Mexican food kick. Nevermind that I had Rosa's on Friday. I wanted Mexican food on a new day - Saturday.

A good girlfriend of mine suggest Blue Adobe. It's close to your house, she said. I gave a mental shrug and thought, \"why not?\"

I had passed Blue Adobe many times on my way to the Mesa Arts Center and had always meant to try it. But each time I passed, it always looked closed. The dark windows they have are very deceptive my friend, very deceptive. Plus, the lack of cars in the parking lot always made me think they were closed, too!

So I pulled up. Then I saw the cars parked *behind* the building. OH!

Walked in and thought it was decorated quite tastefully, although their chairs leave a bit more to be desired.

Chips and salsa were good, I'll give them that. Service was good, too. I think it helped that my friend had been there several times. When she arrived, the server's eyes perked up - I kid you not! He clearly had seen her in there before.

I looked over the menu and realized it's NEW Mexican cuisine. Sorry, I'm not a fan of New Mexico food. When I want Mexican, I want MEXICAN. Don't give me Tex-Mex or New Mex shit.

So...strike one for them.

My friend got the beef lettuce wraps. She raved about how fabulous they were. I kept looking at her lettuce thinking, \"It's freaking iceberg lettuce. How can you be happy with that?\"

I ended up getting their salmon, lettuce and tomato sandwich...it came with fries. The dish was aight for me, but it didn't make me want to do my little happy dance. The bacon was nice. The salmon was nice...and their bread for it was a bit like a ... pita? I didn't pay attention to the bread, thinking it would be a regular ole type of sandwich bread. Nerp. Toast has more substance.

The bonus about the fries? They were unsalted.

I read all the laudatory reviews - best new cafe in 2007, blah blah blah. Culinary delight to the senses...yada yada yada.

I can sum it up with one letter in quick succession: ZZzzzzZzzzz

I'll give this place another shot some other time, but for now I'm gonna leave it be.

If you like New Mexican cuisine, this is the place fer ya. If you want down home plain ole Mexican food, stick to Rosa's (which is what I will do). And hell, should I ever decide I can't hold out on a Sunday for Mexican food because Rosa's is closed, I'll go to Rosita's. Yea, their lack of windows still has great issues for me, but I will take their food any day over Blue Adobe."}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend here for his early birthday present.  He got the Adobo Pork plate and he actually ate all of it. He could not stop eating the Salsa & chips, he ate 3 bowls of salsa.  
OMG it was soo delicious. They have daily specials which are extremely reasonable.  I am definitely coming back & bringing my family."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and a great menu selection.  I would've give it 5 stars but the service was terrible.  The server dropped off our food and never came back to check on us.  I went to the bar to ask someone for sour cream and by the time I got it, we were done eating."}
{"text":"Our server told us the Carne Adovada was the best item on the menu so we both got it, but neither of us really liked the flavor - it is a LOT of the same flavor with nothing to break it up, too. Neither of us were excited about finishing our plates. It was loud and crowded. Service was good, but we're not going back."}
{"text":"This is my husband's favorite Latin food by far.  I find their food too hot to enjoy. Even the amazing lobster dip is too hot to finish in one setting but I am a big baby.  He and my son eat there every time I am out of town. Their service is hit or miss on getting a good server. When you get a good one you will yell what a hidden gem!
Please comment and follow me for more reviews!"}
{"text":"The food isn't fresh. I think that's all I really have to say, but I'll expound a bit more on it. I walked in and the host was friendly. The service was pretty good, but the food took a very long time to come out. The chips came to the table quickly, but they were not fresh chips (bagged and colored variety). The salsa was ok, but it wasn't great either. When the food did come out it was obviously microwaved. I got the chimichilada (1 mini chimi and 1 enchilada) and the person I was with ordered a chicken sandwich. 

When he went to pick it up the bun was so dry it crumbled apart. The fries were microwaved too, and they tasted old. My dish was very large. The rice was over microwaved too though. The chimi was just \"meh\". There was nothing special about it. The enchilada was good, but I don't think it should have been called an enchilada at all. It was a sort of floppy (not fresh) tortilla folded over cut up portabella mushroom (which did taste good). It had a sweet cream sauce over it. The cream sauce was the best part of the whole dinner, but the flavor of the so called \"enchilada\" did not go well with the rest of the plate at all. 

Beyond the food, I'm positive that there was no one under 60 eating there. I'm not against going to places where I'm the youngest person, but it seemed a bit odd. 

I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went for the first time after being told how great they were.  the service was horrible, only 2 people for the entire place.  the Carne Adovada, which I LOVE, was horrible, burnt, the sauce so thick and concentrated it was like paste.  My wife had a soup that left a lot to be desired and the salsa was forgettable.  Quaint decor, but I can't see going back"}
{"text":"If we'd have seen this place just driving down the road, we never would have stopped because from the outside it doesn't look like much. But because I had read so many great reviews we decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad we did! We've now eaten there at least 5 times....each and every time was amazing. The staff is great! The food is absolutely incredible! Beautifully presented and perfectly prepared. The entire staff works very hard to make sure you have a great dining experience. I have not stopped recommending this place to people since I first ate there, and I'm looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"We needed to accommodate 24 rugby players and this restaurant pulled it off without a hitch.  Great service. Numerous chip and salsa refills. A skinny margarita made of only three ingredients- agave nectar, tequila, and lime juice! One word of caution almost every dish was spicy. Perfect for my palate but not for everyone."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant about seven (7) years ago with my ex and between then and now, I just forgot about it...until I passed it the other day. As someone else said, please keep in mind this is a NEW Mexico style restaurant. We arrived, were seated and served chips and delicious salsa immediately. 

I started out with the Milagro Mango Margarita...OMG, very good! A very delicious blend that I wanted more of! We then chose the Hatch Catch Sampler for an appetizer which I would come back for over and over again. It includes Pecan Grilled Shrimp, Mini Crab Cakes and Green Chile Lobster Dip...the crab cakes were the BEST! Everything else on the sampler was great but the cakes...DeLiCiOuS!! 

My main course choice was the Double Stacked Chicken Enchiladas Christmas Style: Red and Green Chile (I would so SUGGEST this choice, Christmas Style, it was very flavorful and added a nice mixture of taste with each bite). This corn tortillas stacked tower of gewwy cheese, chicken and sauce was great (and even better the next day since I took half home).   Next time I'm going to ask for double sauce, they were good but I would have enjoyed a bit more sauce.   I don't like them swimming, but I do like a bit to mix in with each bite.

The service was great. Even though our waitress had more than her fair share of tables/guests, she did a wonderful job! She was spot on, keep my water glass filled (which is hard to do, I'm a fish) and had everything out hot and quickly! 

The only reason it doesn't get a five star is due to my sister getting the Blue Seafood Enchiladas and biting into a very, VERY fishy taste. 
Yeah, yeah, she knows it was \"seafood,\" but you don't anticipate a huge \"fishy\" bite, the flavors should have been blended better so this doesn't happen. She also got a Strawberry Crystal drink that tasted just like a regular Margarita. Hee, hee...she totally was jealous while I slurped my Milagro Mango...sorry, Charlie! 

I recommend this restaurant, best one I have been too in a while despite my sisters poor choices :-)"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Mexican food in Mesa.

Great quality drink selection, fantastic ambiance, tasty food, good service."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the portions are considerable.  I enjoyed the daily special of stacked green enchiladas with shredded beef.  The beans served were whole and well seasoned.  The rice was tasty and had the texture of uncle ben's rice.  It was still good though.  The guac was fresh and delicious.  The salsa not so spicy, but good."}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican food I've had in Arizona! (my fiancé agrees and he's from New Mexico...the closest competition is in New Mexico:)). We've taken many family members of his and mine and no one has been disappointed. The salsa and chips are amazing and the service is always top notch. Go on a Sunday when all the daily specials are available for the 'special' rate. Servings are delicious and huge...we like to order a couple of margaritas and share an entree'."}
{"text":"Oh damn. This place is in a pretty innocuous-looking building (save for the Blue roof!) just outside downtown Mesa. A very casual atmosphere that was desolate at 4:30 but filled up entirely before 5:30. They serve 'a' Sleepy Dog beer (yay, locals!) but that's one more than you usually see on tap.  

I ordered the Carne Adobado (Adovada here, you know how Spanish be) and my Moms had the 'Taos' plate, which comes with a Chile Relleno and a bunch of other things that were unidentifiable under a blanket of cheese (not always a bad thing). 

The food came out within 20 minutes and was piping hot. It couldn't have been any better. The last 'chill' in Arizona before the swelter really starts had just hit, so the moment was perfect for something spicy. The adobado is basically cubes of pork in a spicy/powdery sauce with rice and beans on the side so you can make mini-tortillas out of the stuff. The pork is that \"fall apart\" slow-cooked type that takes years to master.

The server didn't seem to care much for us (the guy could not smile, I swear--but the Boston Marathon bombing had just happened so maybe he was affected) but he was quick and helpful. The price point here is \"two\" dollar signs but the adobado is really only one (10.95). Oh, before I forget, they are one of those rare Mexican places that still give you free chips and a tasty chipotle salsa."}
{"text":"This place has a cool \"hole in the wall\" feel to it.  Kind of small.  Reading the reviews...I guess it's lucky we got a seat on a Friday night (it was kind of late though, around 8:30pm I think).  Started with chips and salsa.  All very good.  Wife loved her chimichanga.  She thought it was great and will definitely be coming back for more.  She also enjoyed her Mango Margarita that had a good kick to it.  I had a double stacked chicken enchilada \"New Mexican\" style with an egg on top (got mine scrambled).  It was quite good also.  Got it \"christmas style\" with Red and Green \"chili sauce\" on the side.  Red was a bit too warm for me and the green wasn't my favorite...but in small doses it was actually pretty good on the enchilada.  I think the salsa would've actually been perfect on this dish and next time I go (yes, I definitely will return) I will order that dish with salsa instead.  Good stuff. 

Service was also pretty good.  It seems the servers (or at least ours) do double-duty tending bar and serving customers.  I did want a water at one point and our food had not come out yet, so he wasn't passing by our table.  I did look up at the bar and he was scanning the room, noticed I was looking up his way to get his attention and he ran right over to see what we needed.  No complaints.  Torn between a 4 and 5 star.  My only issues are subjective to my tastes...not necessarily a statement of the quality of the food or service...so I think I'm going with a 5.  My wife was especially pleased with her meal. 

Finally, their rice is also very good (standard side)."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with my daughter last night. I had the smoked pork tamale, which was excellent, and a chicken enchilada. My daughter had two tacos and enjoyed them as well.

The ambience of the restaurant is OK, although it has a bar right in the middle of the room with TVs. I'm getting really tired of TVs in every place I go. Conversation is becoming a dying art, because everyone has to watch whatever game is on. This restaurant really isn't laid out so you can have a table away from the bar, so people at tables everywhere in the room were hootin' and hollerin' at the ASU game.

If you choose to go here, I'd try to get a table against the wall. The tables in the middle are kind of crowded together. Service was good, if a little scrambled amongst the servers.

All in all, though, a good experience with excellent food."}
{"text":"My go-to Mexican restaurant. I haven't been to another place that has green and red chilli New Mexican style. I have gluten intolerance and none of their sauces have gluten, score for me. My husband has tried dozens of menu items and loves the pollo relleno. Nothing has failed to impress us. Their salsa is roasted tomatoes. And has a lovely taste. I get stacked enchiladas every time and always have enough to take home for a snack later. 

Speaking of a snack, I have some in the fridge now."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  I wouldn't call it Mexican food as much as I would call it southwestern food.  They have excellent salmon tacos and pulled pork.  The pricing is great for the quality. The service is pretty good but could be better."}
{"text":"I was very hopeful for this place. I ordered the carne adovada and my honey ordered the stacked enchiladas. He said I should give it a one, but I have definitely experienced worse, overall. The waiter was good, he brought us everything and it was all correct. He only forgot to bring me an extra tortilla, but later remembered toward the end of my meal. And on the topic of that, the tortillas were pretty bad. Definitely mass produced right here in the factories of the good ol US of A. My adovada was chile-y.. is that a word? It tasted just like chile powder. And the enchiladas were nothing to brag about. Honey hated them. No one was overly nice, although the setting was cute. Kids liked their chicken quesadilla. But they're kids. And it's a quesadilla. 
I can't bring myself to giving this place any more than a 2 star. Maybe I just had too high of hopes for this place... eh..."}
{"text":"After being recommended several times by a friend i finally decided to make it...

The meatloaf was awesome, the carne adovada was excellent and so was the chimichanga..."}
{"text":"Nice pleasant place for lunch. Great stacked enchiladas and a lunch special of lazy tacos."}
{"text":"Guess I lucked out going with only one person. Service at lunch was good and the food was tasty. I can't say that anything was exceptional here but neither was it horrible."}
{"text":"Had the chorizo stuffed chicken and it was out if this world. We went here before a show at Mesa Arts. We were not rushed, but with prompt service, we were done and on our way in under an hour. Happy hour drink specials are great, too!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great menu and wine selection."}
{"text":"I rarely disagree with Yelp reviews so I'm very puzzled by the experience I had here today, given the majority of good reviews.

First, the reason I decided to try this place was because we were in the area and it was ranked high on yelp. Perfect.

We walk in and it smelled funky in there. Like a heavy cleaner smell. It was really offputting.

We were waiting awhile before someone actually came to the host stand. Greeting was pretty icy. The guy was really weird. He grabbed some menus and handed my kids these doodle boards, which is great in theory, except for the fact that they were absolutely filthy. 

The whole place was empty, except for one other couple, and the guy sat us right next to them. What's up with that? You could tell they were kind of thinking why we were sat so close to them when the entire restaurant was empty too.

It took us awhile to get through the menu. We didn't really get the whole Santa Fe concept and it would have been nice for someone to have explained their concept, as any server even half way paying attention could have seen we were having trouble deciding.

Also, we were there during a typical happy hour, but there was no happy hour menu or signage. I had to ask if they offered happy hour and what the drinks/items were, which irritated me.

So the guy that got us our drinks who we thought was our server, disappeared, and another server introduced herself and had a much better personality than the guy. She was very friendly, and talked up the menu quite a bit. Specifically saying how great the seafood is. Well, being from the east coast, we love seafood and settled on the lobster enchilada and salmon blt. My sister ordered a mini chimichanga.

The chimichanga was ok. I've had better. But it was a generous size. My dish and my mom's...terrible.

I got the salmon blt. The salmon was cooked fine. It wasn't dry. But it wasn't fresh. By a long shot. Very fishy. So gross. The bacon was greasy. The tomatoes were old and there was no lettuce. I was also expecting a fresh, authentic sopapilla, and a got a dry roll.

My mom's dish. Just bad. Rancid. And there is NOTHING worse than bad seafood. Our server deflected and said \"hey I recommended the shrimp so you can't blame me.\" Instead of apologizing, offering her something else or comping the offending dish. Unprofessional.

A few positives...the bathroom was spotless and my margarita was good. The salsa is good. And our server was great until the end.

Overall, very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been going to Blue Adobe for years.  Their \"new mexican\" cuisine is always top notch.  A chipotle flavored festival!"}
{"text":"Went and checked this place out over the weekend when I was in town. Giving this place 3 stars because the food was okay but the service was terrible. It took us a good ten minutes to order our drinks and then another 15 after that to order the food. Our water glasses were never filled until they were completely empty, despite people walking around with water pitchers.

I ordered the chicken enchiladas and house margarita on the rocks with salt, which was good. The stacked chicken enchiladas were just OK. Not my favorite but it got the job done. I asked for only rice and NO beans on the side, but ended up getting beans anyway. The reason why I didn't say something was because I knew it was going to be another 20 minutes before we saw our server again and I was too hungry to wait. What really got me was that place wasn't too terribly busy either! 

For dessert, we got the cookie pie with ice cream, but the cookie was as hard as rock! I'm surprised I didn't break my teeth trying to chew it. Anyways, I probably wouldn't come back here, only because I know there's better Mexican food out there and I won't have to wait so long at other places."}
{"text":"I am a professional chimichanga lover and this one by far takes the grand prize ribbon.  Amazing flavor topped with red and green sauce (Christmas).  Fine shredded beef was seasoned so well and moist.  Not a typical chimi I have had at many other restaurants.  They were good but this chimi needs a new word to describe the delectable flavor.  Our server was attentive and polite.  I see why this restaurant has been around a long time"}
{"text":"I won't lie. I was a little disappointed.  Haven't been for a while and we took family here. The service was excellent!! The skinny margarita was also yummy. I couldn't decide what to get so I settled on making my own plate of cheese chili relleno and a pork tamale. I believe the pork was smoked and it was good but the tamale itself was so dark but maybe the masa was a special kind. Even the relleno was deep fried so much it was dark in color as well. Not very appealing to the eye and just so so on taste. I will try again tho."}
{"text":"What delicious & unusual food we found @ The Blue Adobe! We're from San Diego & I don't know of any Mexican there with the flavors of this place....Absolutely delicious. Everything melted in your mouth..... Fabulous flavors. Mexican gourmet!"}
{"text":"Finally convinced to come here after driving by 1000x and I sure wish I had sooner! My husband and I went for dinner and the ambiance was amazing. I had no idea it was so nice inside. We were promptly greeted, sat immediately on a Saturday night. Place was full and had great service. The salsa was awesome and spicy. The meals speaks for itself. (Land of enchantment & beef chimichanga) then the grand finale of an adult size Creme Brûlée - finally a place that has more than 3 spoonfuls. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place exemplifies the idea of service! We walked in, and the place was booked for the entire night. It was 4:30 pm on a Saturday night! The hostess agreed to find us a seat, thankfully, as we were away from our normal hood and excited to return to Blue Adobe. We have been here several times and we love it! The food and service was outstanding! Our server, Jessica, was attentive and awesome! Our food was quick and yummy. The drinks were superb. Go here, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"'It's Mexican food captain, but *not* as we know it.  I was introduced to this place many years ago and I keep coming back because the food is good and I've never found another place quite like it.  The flavors are a little different than what I'm used to.  This is New Mexican food as in that state next door, not New as in nouveau or anything pretentious like that.  The speicals are usually decent but I'm a sucker for my old standbys.  The spooning rellenos plate and the Sante Fe which is a sort of mix and match  create our own which I always get with a chile relleno, a cheese enchilada and either a beef taco or a beef tamale.  Mmm!

They have two sorts of sauces that get draped over stuff, red and green.  Green is spicy. Red is hot.  If you don't like hot, don't say I didn't warn you.  I always order it on the side.  It feels a little bit prissy but that way I don't have to deal with too much sauce if I don't feel like it.  And hell, I'm the one who has to eat it and pay for it, so I want it how I want it.

I'm surprised at the reviews for bad service as I've always had good service there.  I must just be so charming that people go out of their way to be nice to me.  Yeah that's it! So if you go, remember to be charming, and bring your Visa card.. because they .. oh wait, they do? Nevermind."}
{"text":"As I write this review I am stuffed to capacity on delicious New Mexico Style Mexican Food. I came here after work to grab some food to go on the way home. While waiting for my takeout I was treated to some delicious chips and salsa and had an ice cold beer off the tap, the blue salsa was definitely a treat. I ordered the Chiles Rellenos stuffed with cheese served \"Christmas Style.\" It was equally delicious and filling. I think I'll become a regular here."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I'm not fiving 5 stars is because the waiter got two of our orders wrong. However... we didn't care because the food is just that good! I cannot wait to go back again! Don't forget to take advantage of the check-in special. The guacamole is delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here on Weekday evening before New Years.  We were a group of 7, adults and teenagers.  Loved the atmosphere, service was excellent and everyone enjoyed their meals.  My finicky son who hates everything, just loved their burger.  I had crab stuffed salmon special.  It was great.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and service every time. Jalepeno bacon is delicious along with anything else in their brunch menu. Clean and consistent"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Blue Adobe so much over the years, but our experience there this evening will likely put me off from ever returning. Friends had expressed disgust at the rudeness of the owner, but until this evening I hadn't met her and couldn't imagine what they meant. Having called this morning to reserve a specific table for my birthday and had my reservation cheerfully confirmed, I arrived with my parents and two children at 5:30pm, exactly on time. We were seated at our table, complete with requested high chair. A minute later, the greeter - and the owner! - descended on our party, declaring that the table was reserved for a birthday party and that we must move. Somewhat baffled, I explained with a smile that it was in fact my own birthday party for which it was reserved, to which the owner interrupted with a snap: \"Well, I'm the owner, and I took all the calls today - there weren't any calls this morning and you need to move now.\" I was staggered: not only at the sheer rudeness and complete absence of good customer relations, but at the unprecedented accusation of having lied about making the reservation! We left immediately, and - no thanks to Blue Adobe - my birthday was saved by a fantastic meal at The Oak Room, just a mile away. Silver lining to a shockingly bad experience. A real shame for what has in the past been a great restaurant. (Oh, and the greeter was trying hard to be mannerly and save the situation - if you're reading this, I did appreciate that it wasn't your fault!)"}
{"text":"A group of us called ahead to let the restaurant know how many people would be in our party of 12 to 14. We arrived 15 minutes early, ordered our food and sat for an hour and a half and never received our food. We had prior engagements and had to leave. We all paid our bills without ever having received our food. They packaged our food to go. Other patrons of the restaurant came in after hour party, received their food and left before we were ready to leave. One of our party's bill was $9.73. She gave the waiter a $20 bill and he returned change of a $10 bill. I am only giving the Blue Adobe one-star because I can't give them 0."}
{"text":"Drive by this place mutiple times without stopping. Read some reviews on here and decided to give a try. Awesome food and atmosphere! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! The food and service were fabulous. I had the shrimp taco that was outstanding. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night. Margarita was stong, redeemed my coupon for guacamole and it was good.  They have daily specials and today happened to be the carnade abdola it was so tender and spiced just right! Atmosphere casual but a little nicer then most Mexican restaurant. I would come here again"}
{"text":"AMAAAZING!

I'm from California so the Mexican food I am used to has me picky and particular. After moving here for 4 years now I have had many-many-many disappointments.

Although this food is a more of a New Mexican feel, it was absolutely delicious and rustic with a bit of fusion going on. We went for breakfast this past Sunday and I was automatically charmed by the exterior; the inside was just as if not even more charming, service was great and the food was delicioso! 

I had a Pork Tamale with a fried egg(which I order a la cart), for breakfast; there is no other way to eat a tamale, all I needed was some champagne! I also order a cup of the pozole. I had a moment where I wished my cup was magical like Mary Poppins bag and that the soup would never stop, but hence it did.

My family loved there food we will very much be going back!"}
{"text":"We were in last weekend for the first time and I'm SO happy we are local so we can enjoy it again! I was super impressed with how they presented the kids menu. It was on a hand-held drawing board! My son sat there and played with it the entire time. 

We had the Shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and WOW were those things HUGE. I loved the pico in the glass and the way it was served. 
We both ordered the Portabella & Steak and my son ordered a cheese pizza off the cool kids menu. The steaks took a bit long to cook so our awesome waiter, Jordan, brought my son's pizza out beforehand because 6 yr olds aren't very patient when they're hungry. :o)

When our steaks finally came, I was surprised at the portabella part, I assumed it would be on top of the steak but it was on the side as a dish of portabella Quesadilla type thing, covered in a white sauce. It was very good! 

Once we finished Jordan brought us a complimentary dessert for having to wait a bit longer for our steaks. We all shared the creme brule and I would go back for that alone! 

The only downfall was that the table top was a bit small for the three of us and I had to move things to the side bar to make more room."}
{"text":"Seriously fantastic Southwest Mexican food! My mom and I are in town for my grad school graduation and after landing we were haaangry (hungry with some sass) after a day of travels from Chicago. We yelped it up and came across this little gem! 
We weren't looking to eat a feast large enough for a kingdom, so we settled on appetizer portions. Mom had the crab cakes and I, being a fish abstainer, opted for chicken quesadillas! Love me some quesadillas!! Num, num, num! The chips and salsa were crazy delicious too, I totally recommend eating an obnoxious amount of their salsa. I did... ;-)
Now the atmosphere. Holy crap. Loved. It. So pretty and chill, but I could see myself getting schwasted on some delicious margs here too!
I highly recommend this place and I will DEFINITELY be back before heading home to good ole Chicago."}
{"text":"Honistly some of the worst cod I've ever had. I'm extremely picky when it comes to Mexican food and I have not found a single thing on the menu I like. My mom lives this place but the rest of my family makes fun of her and complains each time she suggests it. Save your money go somewhere else. I mean who puts tortilla chips on a Caesar salad?"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of this place. I think they were a little short staffed or something the night I was there because service was a little slow. But they made up for it by treating me to a margarita. Enchiladas with chicken and red sauce were quite decent!"}
{"text":"So my best friend and I went here since we heard this place is amazing..and wow, I  was not disappointed. There was a 15 minute wait so we went to the bar to have a drink. The bartender, I forgot her name, was attentive and friendly, we gave her a great tip. What surprised us is that once we sat down at our table, she came up to us and thanked us for it, I was very shocked and impressed (if you ever have her as the bartender, make sure you tip her well, she is awesome! I just wish I remembered her name...). Anyways, the chips and salsa were brought out with drinks after oh I don't know.. a minute after we sat down? Dang can I say exceptional service? The salsa was for me, something new, I liked it a lot.

On to the entree... I could not decide between the Stacked Enchiladas or the Enchantment.  I ended up just asking the server to surprise me,  I could tell he was a little 'wait what?' towards me, but hey, I am so indecisive..especially when I am starving. I ended up having the Enchantment and oh my gosh, it was SO GOOD. It was soo much food and the red sauce was a bit spicy, but it was the perfect amount of spice. I am also not a huge fan of chicken in enchiladas, but wow..it was tender and moist, not dry at all!  The steak was cooked perfectly and for me, I was blown away. Most places I go to, their steak is ehhhh...the only other places I have been impressed by steak would be The Keg and Orange Sky ha. Anyways, it also came with green chile mashed potatoes (pretty spicy, and as much as I wanted to eat it.. I passed, but VERY good, just wasn't in the mood for more spicy food ha). The vegetables were amazing as well, cooked perfectly!

Oh and I can't forget the shrimp, it was on top of the steak with this yummy cream sauce that I can't remember what it was..maybe hollandaise? I don't know. Either way, both the shrimp and the sauce were freaking good, especially with the steak. Lastly, my friend ended up getting the Garden Enchiladas..she liked it a lot, but that's about it..didn't say anything much about them.

At the end of the meal, I was completely satisfied, even though I felt fat for like 3 hours.. and I just laid on the couch at home. So worth it though haha.

GET THE ENCHANTMENT! :)"}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem!! Everything we've had here is fantastic! This is also one of the only New Mexican places you can go where the green chili is about flavor and not just melt-your-face-heat. The garden enchiladas are amazing and very different from any other I've tried, the burger with a chili relleno...so darn good!! No matter what you choose, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I think I just made love to the chicken chorizo plate, amazing!!! My new favorite place for sure. I just hope no one finds out about this place, I would have to kill someone for that plate. Haa haa but really, best thing I've ever eaten, call Guy Ferreti."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually don't care for New Mexican food, but this place is awesome.    The salsa is great, I love their salads and everything else I have ever ordered from there. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really freakin good. If you're a chips and salsa guy like myself, you will like this place, as you will nearly fill up on nice fresh hot chips and a really good salsa. 

I channeled my inner grade school self and had a chimichanga. This chimichanga however is far different from the one you find in a school lunch line. I had the shredded beef with a red sauce and it was super good. Everything that everyone else ordered in the group I was with also really liked their food and it looked really good."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Servers are great! Always so friendly. Food is hands down some of the best I've had. Their menu has so much variety. If I had to recommend one meal id say go for the ribs. The best! 

A+++"}
{"text":"Horrible just plain bad first I order a beer and then had a Business call so I step out side so I can hear and I'm outside taking to my supplier and this lady comes out screaming and yelling u can't take beer out of my establishment grabs it out of my hand your lucky I don't call the cops I get back in sit down with my family and I have my lobsters tamales and I find a 2 foot hair In my dish I ask for a new order and it to be comped the lady adamantly refused stating I was bitter about the beer and when the waiter come over starts filling glasses with water my mom is like this is vodka tonic and that's sprite save your money don't come here"}
{"text":"I've been to Santa Fe and Las Cruces and spent time there. I know hatch green chiles when I see them and taste them. The food was amazing. My mom thought the tacos were too spicy when they weren't supposed to be but she's picky lol the rest of the bunch ate the food and was 100% satisfied with food and service. Atmosphere was laid back and great things to look at."}
{"text":"My wife and i had the pleasure of dining here on 1/4/14.  We were seated right away.  The ambiance was good, i caught the football game from the bar located right in the middle of the place.  The service (Alice) was some of the best i've ever experienced (and i waited tables for several years in my college years).  I asked about the adovado and she quickly brought out a sample of the pork for us to try.  She also noticed i had pulled up the free guac on check-in on my phone and had it to our table in about a minute.  You just don't get that level of service from most places now-a-days.  I chose the plate that had 3 different options.  I had the pork adovado, shredded beef buro and the chicken taco.  Everything was excellent.  The adovado was the best i've had.  I would highly recommend this and have already done so to immediate family."}
{"text":"About my 4th visit here and I do not live in AZ.  The multiple visits should speak for itself as this place is good.  Absolutely everything appears to be unique and if your order fits your taste, expect to be impressed."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the average of the two visits is a 3. The first time was an #evfn event that gave them 1 star for embarrassingly terrible service for my one margarita.

This time I dined there for lunch with a group of 6 and it was a 4! Unbelievable!

Lets just start with the salsa; the lovely, surprisingly dark addictive salsa. I recall at least 4 occasions where I inquired if it was available for take home purchase. Yay once again for non tomato based salsa!

Additionally I had a seafood enchilada that was TO. DIE. FOR. Honestly. It was just the right size for lunch and had salmon, halibut, shrimp, delicious cheese and was made with no tomato as requested. Topped with green Chile it had an amazing flavor that I ended up craving the rest of the day.

Everyone in my group was completely satisfied. Even the meatloaf sandwich lunch special a coworker had looked delicious and I don't even really like meatloaf. 

The service was kinda awkward, for lack of better words, but this completely made me feel better about this place. While it's a little out of the way, I can see it becoming a work lunch spot on occasion... and I won't complain and tell them about my horrid experience from before."}
{"text":"To me this was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! I know the difference between GRINGO MEXICAN, and New Mexico FOOD! To me, this could have been lights outs, but the Manager on Duty was our server. Well, time was very slow, refills very slow, and I had five others with them and they must use the same spice(s) in many dishes. Being in the RESTAURANT BUSINESS for over 35 years, I DO NOT LIKE TO GIVE A NEGATIVE REVIEW!! I want to give this place another try, but sampling others, this brings me back to the taste of the food! The PEPPER POT in Hatch New Mexico is the BEST NEW MEXICAN FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD, and this might be a BARRIER on my JUDGEMENT. Just telling it like it is, and sorry if this is a downer!!!"}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful experience with the entire staff! The owner even paid us a visit. More importantly we watched her work with her employees and she was amazing! You could see the love and respect for her, and it showed in the service and quality of the food! Also I must tell you it is a scratch kitchen! \"Everything but the ketchup is from scratch!\"

We are going back tonight for more!

Second trip was as good as the first! This time we had lobster stuffed tamales and a shrimp, fontina Chile rellano...what? It was AMAZING!!! Try the salmon lettuce wraps for an appetizer...the salmon melts in your mouth! No joke! It is a meal unto itself! Whenever we are in town again we will ALWAYS come by here! This place deserves a perfect score!"}
{"text":"I didn't love it, but I liked it.  It was a bit spicy for my taste but I'm a wimp.  The food had a very good taste even if it was spicy.  I had a mini chimi which was plenty for me.  The beans were great and the rice had a lot of flavor just a little to hot.  Yes, even the rice was too spicy.  I told you I was a wimp.  Margarita was good. But the atmosphere...I loved the decor.  The place is fabulous.  The inside is nothing like the outside....thank goodness.  My son and his wife love the place, they are not wimps.  They frequently drive from apache junction for dinner.  But, like I said, they are not wimps."}
{"text":"Super delicious!  I tried a new restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the chimichanga and all the flavors mixed together so well! I wouldn't mind coming back again and trying somet b in different:)"}
{"text":"Great attentive service. Ate here for lunch (2pm). Place is medium size, a lil dark but it set a good mood. Our host greeted us at the door. Through out our dining, the server was very attentive and checked on us often. The food was a good portion. I ordered the Taos Combo, which was a shrimp enchilada, honey smoked tamale and a breaded deep fried chili relleno. Amazing taste, food was piping hot. My partner ordered, the stacked enchiladas with a fried egg. He finished it off. I, however had a huge plate so I wasn't able to finish my big meal. All in all, this is a great place to dine. Will surely be coming back."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 10 on Sunday night after a performance at Mesa Center for the Arts.  They were all set up and ready for us.  We made it for happy hour beverages and enjoyed the chips and salsa.  There seemed to be a little confusion about who was our server.  Shortly one of the guys came over to take orders.  Food came out fairly quickly and was simple.  I had the blue seafood enchiladas which were delicious - blue corn tortillas filled with shrimp, lobster and a white fish. Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Our server split our check four ways such made paying quick and easy.  I'd recommend this restaurant for small or bigger groups.  In fact, it's a cute place for a date night!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here, I'm from the bay area and I know that we're spoiled down here with a variety of very good Mexican Restaurants to choose from. In Az there are quiet a few fast-food style Mexican Restaurants but very few home-style.  I came here on the last day of my trip and had a great experience.  The free chips that they served before the meal were warm and fresh. The salsa was fresh and authentic, and the meal was well prepared. To top it off, the waiter was great!  Oh, also, The Apple Sopopias were exceptional! When I come back next year I'll be sure to stop by again!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Don't know if I would come back here. Dark and dirty looking. Had the spicy chicken pizza. Disappointed because the crust was frozen. The toppings tasted ok. Chicken is almost always dry on a pizza anyway. 
Husband had the chimichanga. He ate it but probably wouldn't order it again. Wasn't that busy for lunch. Should have taken the hint"}
{"text":"What a yummy restaurant!! It is right down the street from my house, so it is a great stop for a great family meal. The food is fresh, and the service from Dane was great! I highly recommend Blue Adobe :)"}
{"text":"I've been eating and drinking in bars all over the US and Europe for twenty years now. I often order soda water with my meals, and never have I ever been charged for it; not at least until I visited the Blue Adobe Grille. Not only was I charged for soda water from the tap (I may have understood $1), they charged $2.45 for it! The burger I ordered came with wizened red onions, and my burger bun was a little flat. Maybe their entrees are a little more up to the quality that would warrant the use of the old English form of the word grill, using an E, but I didn't experience it. For now, Blue Adobe, I'd call you a grill, not a grille."}
{"text":"I was so happy when I found this place on Yelp and even happier after eating here!! I had the chorizo stuffed chicken breast with a hatch chili stuffed w a chipotle mash potato. Excellent flavor and spice was mild/medium.  Salsa and chips are great and service was excellent!! Will come here again!"}
{"text":"Very good food reminds me of an upscale Chevys! I had a shredded beef chimichanga. The rest of my party had stacked enchiladas and chimichangas. The salsa is yummy it's on the chipotle side. 
Definitely a great recommendation by the hotel!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Went their with a bunch of colleagues from work. Service was good and menu options are great."}
{"text":"This was a great find! Food was really good, good sized portions and and the service was excellent. The layered enchiladas were fantastic + Christmas style + A fried egg = crazy good."}
{"text":"pretty crowded- we were seated quickly though. Cheerful waitress Food was just fine."}
{"text":"I am a regular here. Great consistent food and wonderful friendly service. Incredible New Mexico style cuisine in the heart of Arizona. I have tried pretty much every dish on the menu at least once. My favorite would be the Green Chile Carne Adovada. I also highly recommend the Smoked Pork Tamale! Some of the best salsa I have had anywhere. Bold, smoked, fire roasted flavor. The Posole' is also insanely good. In my eyes this place can do no wrong. Yes, I have tried Los Dos Molinos, (which I feel is really good and different) yet if I had to recommend one I still feel this place does New Mexico cuisine much better. Go here now!"}
{"text":"Came here a month ago with a bunch of coworkers. Everyone really enjoyed their meals.  I loved it so much I made sure to come back while visiting on my next trip. The flagship dish, the Carne Adovada, is ridiculously awesome. The flavors are sincere.  The atmosphere is relaxed and comfy.  Definitely worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Wow. Stumbled upon this place and boy are we glad we did. Everything we ate was fantastic! Rellenos, Enchiladas, Queso. Even the chips and salsa were fantastic. Service matches the food. Brianna was as good as it gets! When we visit AZ we will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"We were planning on meeting my dad at Rosa's for dinner, but after pulling into their dark parking lot last night, I realized we would need other options.  We struck out on option 2 (why is no place in Mesa open on Sunday nights?!) before yelping our way to Blue Adobe Grille.

My expectations were low.  The restaurant looks like it took over an abandoned International House of Pancakes building (only smaller).  The interior is generic 70's diner, but clean and well lit.  There were a handful of people scattered at tables around the restaurant and we took a table near the bar where two LCD tv's were showing football.  When I took a look at the menu and saw we were in a New Mexican style restaurant, things started looking up.   

On the wall are a couple of chalkboard panels showing the daily specials, each something off the regular menu offered that day for $10.  On Sundays, you could pick any of those items for $10.  That just about made the trip right there.  We each ordered off the \"specials\" menu.  Dad added a side salad to his stacked enchilada.  The salad came quickly, it filled an 8 inch place and had about 1/2c of goat cheese on top, with roasted red peppers and baby greens.  Our meals came about 10 minutes later: Blue Seafood enchiladas (shrimp, salmon and crab in blue corn tortillas with rice and whole pinto beans), Chorizo stuffed chicken with chipolte mashed potatoes and stacked chicken enchiladas.  The portions were amble, but with quality ingredients; boneless, skinless chicken breast, all white meat sliced chicken in the stacked enchiladas, roasted pepper sauces, fontina and goat cheeses.  Everything was delish.  And at $10 per entrée, the bargain of the century.

We are definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was a little confused coming out of the Blue Adobe. I may have set my expectations too high but delicious, authentic Mexican this was not. Their building reminds me of an old fast food seafood chain, and the servers seemed to be in their own worlds. I couldn't get an answer to \"what would you recommend?\" so I went with, \"What are the most popular dishes?\". First the positive - great fresh brewed iced tea, complimentary fire roasted salsa was delicious, the portions are HUGE, daily specials, and a fully stocked bar. The not so great...the oil. I ordered Shrimp Rellenos which was recommended as the best on the menu. What I got was two partially deep fried peppers dripping with oil and cheese with sporadic chunks of shrimp. Unfortunately, my husband wasn't anymore pleased with his meal. He had the Carne Adovada. The red chili adobo was super moist full of slow cooker awesomess but the green chili was very dry.  Wouldn't go back but, based on the ratings, I could have hit them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Definitely the best restaurant in Mesa.  The food is always fantastic.  The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly and attentive.  The green chili lobster dip is a must and the garlic shrimp pizza is a flavor explosion in your mouth.  You've got to try this place."}
{"text":"Delicious New Mexico-style food.  Portions are hearty, and service is very good."}
{"text":"There is an obvious mental disconnect between my present day and past selves. Although I don't eat much now, when looking over the menu the fat boy in me still says yes, I want that. In the past I used to go to Mexican restaurants and order the taco, burrito, enchilada special so after seeing a Groupon for Blue Adobe Grille (although I didn't purchase it), I stopped after being in the area. I noticed the Santa CaFe - which allows customers to choose two or three items from a list of about 6. Pork tamale sounded good, as well as the shredded beef taco, and to complete the trifecta a chicken enchilada. 

The meal began with complimentary tri-colored chips with a nice chipotle salsa. I had some of those, along with a frozen margarita with the Chambord float (called the Old School Float). I also finished off two waters. When the plate arrived it had a side of pinto beans and rice (both excellent, by the way). I saw the taco and at first glance didn't think anything of it, but when I went to wrangle it I realized it was the fattest taco I have seen in my life. Suddenly I felt as if I were on an episode of Man vs. Food. I started on the taco and used the napkin in hand technique perfected by Adam Richman. The taco had a nice dizzled sauce on top that had a little heat and a double layer of tortilla to hold the tasty contents. I felt full - but that can't be - it was just a taco...I had to at least make an attempt at the enchilada and tamale. I had a bite of each and had to throw in the towel. In this battle of man vs. food - food won."}
{"text":"Went to the Blue Adobe Grille before our show at Mesa Arts Center this past Friday (saw Mythbusters Tour!!).  We originally were going to go to Queens, but I wanted a sit down, since we hardly ever go to a restaurant and this was kind of a date night/anniversary celebration.  

J checks out restaurants on the Yelp app, and comes across BAG with its 190+ reviews and 4 star rating.  We figured we'd give it a shot.  We walk in and are immediately seated.  Looking around, I began to get scared.  95% BLUE HAIR CUSTOMERS!  Did we make a mistake in coming here??  

I mention to the server that we have tickets to a show at the arts center (lots of area restaurants give discounts.etc) and he said sounds good, took our order, and a few minutes later brought out our bean dip.  

J's order - Cruz kitchen: He thought the relleno was good, very flavorful.  The tamale he did not care for all that much.  I tried a bite and it was on the dry side.  

My Order - I originally wanted to get the adovada lettuce wraps as my dinner, but at the suggestion of the server, I got the Blue Seafood Enchiladas Friday dinner special.  It came with beans (ranch style beans) and rice.  The beans were okay and rice was very flavorful.  The enchiladas though were tough.  After 1 bite, left the tortillas and just ate the insides, which was supposed to be a combination of Halibut, Salmon, and Shrimp.  They were mostly filled with salmon.  Didn't detect any halibut and had maybe 2 pieces of shrimp.  I wish I had gone with the lettuce wraps.  

I think maybe if we're in the area, we'd give it another go.  But would definitely order different items though."}
{"text":"After all the reviews I read, and recommendations from friends my wife and I tried this place out.  Both me and my wife love spicy food, but this was too much.  It took away from the taste of the dishes, which otherwise would have been good.

It was hard to taste any flavor because each bite was a mouthful of heat.  We also had a couple of drinks and taste no alcohol, the mix drinks should have been stronger.

The place was just ok, I don't think we would go back."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this place. The reviews looked good but it didn't live up to what I read. The service was great. We had a tall handsome young man serving us and he was on top of it. However the food was not up to par. The chimichanga was a soggy mess and the burger tasted like it's been in the freezer for a while.

And DO NOT order the \"lettuce wraps\". They are not what you think. They sent out chunks of iceberg lettuce, quartered along with piles of lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream and chicken slices. It was REALLY LAME. The gentleman who brought it out to us even seemed to serve it with a hint of pity in his eyes.

I wanted this place to be good and be able to write a great review. I love supporting local when I can but I just can't do it with the Blue Adobe. But maybe I just caught them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Place was really good. The service was pretty good too. We obviously got chips and salsa, this salsa was excellent! It is very smokey and if you park in the back you can see where they have the pecan wood stored for their smoked shrimps and chicken and anything else I guess. 

We got the Hatch Catch sampler that had corn cakes, shrimps, and lobster dip. The crab/corn cakes were more corn, sort of reminded me of a hush puppy more than a crab cake, underwhelmed but the description on the menu is exact, just still not what we expected. The lobster dip was great, super full of langoustines and very flavorful. The show stopper was the shrimps that were pecan smoked, soooo good, fresh and cooked to perfection, wish we had like fifteen of them!

The house marg was avail as a carafe fdor two, not too strong but decent for ten bucks for a half carafe.

Definitely will be back, the food and quality and service was great, cannot wait to explore more of the menu options as all sound exciting :)

BTW, our bartender /server was Andy, he was very nice."}
{"text":"My friend and I come to eat here a lot! I love their enchiladas and Beef chimichangas. I also love their margaritas and their sangria. Their service has always been great, and they always seem to know a lot of their customers. I really love this place, great dishes and great happy hour that is on weekends too! I love that!"}
{"text":"We hadn't  been to Arizona in years, so we were initially itching for Mexican food, but Blue Adobe turned out to be relatively near where we were staying and had some great reviews on Yelp, so we went. It was absolutely fantastic. However, it's not for everyone. We did not find it to be especially hot-spicy, but chili powder is in a lot. The salsa that comes with the chips is rich, thick and flavorful, but if you really, really like the tomato-centric salsa of the typical Mexican or Tex-Mex place, you might not like this dark, smoky salsa. I had a special, halibut rubbed in ancho chile spices with a shrimp enchilada. The fish was dry -- a big hazard for fish -- but good. The enchilada was out of this world. The rice was very good, though I hit a lumpy pocket of spice that hadn't dispersed in the pot. There was so much on the menu we would want to try, if we stayed in the Mesa area for a week we could come in every night and keep trying different things."}
{"text":"I eat at Blue Adobe every couple of weeks or so and have enjoyed (at different times) the salmon tacos, the shrimp rellenos, the hatch meatloaf (with a unique potato thing drenched in spices), the carne pork chunks, and of course the stacked enchiladas (I asked for both the red and green sauces on them last night).  The portions are filling here...  It's sort of a quiet bar atmosphere serving---not Senoran or Mexico City style food---but various proteins doused with quality ingredients and a kick.  I couldn't tell you if this stuff really originates in New Mexico..."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a great restaurant. We come here often and have had the posole( delicious and so contorting on a cold day) , lobster dip( tasted good but I'm just not a fan of cheese or lobster) , grilled ancho salmon( delicious), and carne adobada pork....that is one of the best dishes here. Smoky and spicy, such a great flavor and meat so tender it falls apart. The salsa that comes with the chips has an addicting smoky flavor, I could probably fill up on that alone.
The only complaint I have us the last time we were in it was an hour and a half before closing but felt somewhat hurried by staff to wrap it up and pay the bill. Three different servers came by, interrupting our conversation a few times to see if we were done with plated, needed boxes, and as soon as we paid the check someone swooped in and grabbed it.  They were still serving food to other tables as we left( still well below closing) so it was a bit annoying that it seemed like they were trying to hustle us along. I get it, people want to go home, but we didn't sail in 5 mins before closing and expect a 3 course meal."}
{"text":"The service was superb! We were greeted immediately upon entering with a smile and a wonderful attitude. Our server Megan was very attentive and helpful. Then the food came and oh my goodness was it amazing! We got the shrimp enchilada and it was smoky and very flavorful! We also had the vegetable enchilada and it had fresh vegetables and was very flavorful. The salsa was smokey and delicious. You can't go wrong eating here. You WON'T be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh my super good food and excellent service with  our waiter Austin . I highly recommend . Vicki the manager was on top of quality . Great food EXCELLENT  Service"}
{"text":"Great food, relaxed atmosphere, tasty adult beverages. Real copper mugs for your Moscow Mules. 

The prices are reasonable , especially with the variety of daily specials. 

Voted top ten Burgers of Phoenix. Delish!
Carne Adovada is so tender. Dry rub ribs have a flavor combo I can't find anywhere else. 

I will usually come here twice every trip to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"If you have kids this is not the restaurant for you. The flavors are way to complicated for a simple pallet.  That being said, my husband and I loved it! The atmosphere is warm and cozy, the chips hot and fresh and the salsa hot! I had the lazy tacos everyone at the table tried to steal them from me."}
{"text":"Wow! All the reviews are correct - this place rocks! Went for Sunday Brunch (served till 12:30pm) but you can also order off the regular menu, which is huge. 

Brunch menu has about 10 options. Had the veggie omelet, which was excellent - smoky/spicy Jack cheese and fresh veggies. Served with tri-colored breakfast potatoes which were also very good.

Also had the green chili pork eggs. Fantastic! Huge hunks of pork smothered in an amazing green chili. Topped with two eggs and some wonderful beans. Such a value for $10!

Also had the Sunday daily special ($10 for Carne Asada), which was indeed special and would be any day of the week (normally $11.99). Had the red chili version. Super depth of flavor. 

Free tri-colored chips - served warm and probably homemade - come with some fantastic (thick) salsa, which I'm guessing they roast their own tomatoes and chilies for. If you ask, they'll bring you some spicier salsa as well.

Can't wait to go back for more $10 daily specials, happy hour, and basically to try as much as I can from the extensive menu.

You can tell they put a ton of care into all of the food. The quality and flavors, not to mention portion size and prices are all 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Oh this place was great!! The wait is awful, so just know that. If you come here on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner you will be waiting for quite a while if you show up at peak times. But once we got seated everything was great from there. The service was friendly and fast and the food was really good! It's one of those places where you want to keep eating after you're full. I would definitely want to come back here and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Blue Adobe Grille for years. Recenlty, the service and food quality received there leaves a lot to be desired.

The last time in, I was there with my GF and excited to share Blue Adobe with her. Unfortunately, the dining experience was bad for several reasons.

Our order took more than one hour to reach the table, which made for an uncomfortable situation. As other patrons were being seated, receiving their food, and leaving, before ours arrived.  It was embarrassing when the table next to us had a second couple come in and actually receive their food before ours did.  

It was clear that one of a few things may have happened, possibly. These include that our order was not fired in the kitchen, that the food was perhaps messed up and had to be remade, or that our server simply forgot to ring it in.  But it was disappointing that there was no explanation as per the wait. It was not so busy that night that it was simply the result of the kitchen being backed up. It took our server more than a half hour to replenish the tortilla chips. And even then, she did not refill the salsa or refill our drinks.

When the food arrived, my girlfriend's meal lacked the correct proportions and almost resembled that of an appetizer.

When we communicated our disappointment with the evening, there was no apology or reasonable explanation offered. The server simply suggested that we pick a dessert in a somewhat rushed tone. Almost curt. To our dismay, the quality of the desert served was not very good. 

For what it's worth, I had ordered (and enjoyed) my usual meal in the Carne Adovada. 

I do wish to return to Blue Adobe Grille, but have hesitated the last few times the craving set in. Here's hoping the best for this place; love the location, history and menu."}
{"text":"Food is terrific, service is, too! Homemade salsa, so it varies a little from day to day. They have the usual Mexican dishes and offer some eclectic specialties also. Good for lunch or dinner. Every member of my family loves this place!"}
{"text":"Mesa does not have a lot of fine dining, so Blue Adobe is really a gem.  I love the Vegetarian Chimichange and the fish tacos.  But perhaps my favorite part of the meal is the dinner salad.  They really know how to put together greens.  I highly recommend the entire experience."}
{"text":"Visited May 2015:  \"Mesa Hidden Gem\"

I came in with my mother, for the first time, on Mother's day. The atmosphere was lively, but not too loud; the decor was very Southwestern where I felt I was in Sante Fe NM; the staff was polite and friendly. Our waitress provided us with a large bowl of chips and some salsa. There are no various of salsa, so unfortunately my hot chili craving was denied. The salsa she brought did have a great flavor blend. There was a margarita special going on , for mothers, and we partook. The margaritas were just the right combination of tart and fruity. We shared an appetizer, that came with more chips, and I got the lobster tamales main entree. I also had the creme brulee, which was one of the largest bowls I have very seen. The meal was filling, and I brought home at least half of mine, so did my mother. I would definitely come back with my immediate family."}
{"text":"We bring out of town guests here because we know it will be good food and service consistently"}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food!!! This is one of our favorite places to eat out. Everything we've tried is delicious - stacked enchiladas, carne adovada, chorizo-stuffed chicken, even the meat loaf. Sponning rellenos are great (not sure what spooning means, but the meal is very tasty).  The salsa that comes with the chips is out of this world. Service is friendly and efficient. 

We visited Santa Fe, and our relatives took us out to a couple of places for \"good New Mexico food.\" They were fine, but neither could hold a candle to  the Blue Adobe Grill for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Very good Tex Mex here. Had the triple platter of enchiladas, one seafood in blue corn tortilla wrap, one regular beef and one regular chicken with beans and rice. All were very good. Had a mix of sauces, red and green. Both were good.  Chips and salsa came with, and salsa is weird. It's smoky, brown and has no heat to it. Was tasty but. It like anything I've had before. Margarita was good. Prices very reasonable. It's a New Mexico style Mexican food place and I loved it."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the East Valley. I've been going to Blue Adobe for about five years, and it's as good today as it was the first time I visited. The service is first rate and attentive, with seating prompt, and the restaurant is clean (including the bathrooms).

Blue Adobe is a great option for someone who likes Mexican but wants a healthier option. Nothing is smothered in cheese, is refried, or is greasy, even when fried. Portions are huge, but they aim for quality more than quantity.

My favorite dish the Adobe Salad (a large with added shrimp will put you back about $15, but it's worth every penny), made of baby greens, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, tortilla strips, and the most amazing and addictive orange/chipotle dressing and your choice of protein (tenderloin, shrimp, salmon, chicken, or none at all).

Another great dish worth mentioning are the tenderloin rellenos. Typical Mexican restaurant chili relenos are eggy with greasy filling; these are lightly breaded and filled with high quality cheese and meat. These rellenos hold their pepper shape well too; you won't find a chile flattened across your plate here.

The negatives: it can get kind of loud from conversation. I also thought their pizza was mediocre, but I think the pizza dishes aren't on the menu anymore.

Pay no attention to the rash of one-star reviews. Blue Adobe seats about 30-40; if the group had actually tried to make a reservation for a group that big, they'd have been told to rent the whole restaurant for the night. Shame on them for showing up with more people than promised and then flaming this review board."}
{"text":"Went to dinner before a show at Mesa arts center. Glad we made reservations as the place was really busy. Got seated right away. We were there at happy hour so had really decent margarita at a great price. Chips and salsa were very good with some good zip. There were four of us and everyone had something different and all said it was amazing.
We hadn't been here in several years and glad we came back.
Service was very good.  We will be back.
Also the price was very reasonable. For two dinners and drinks it was $42 with a tip."}
{"text":"My friend Tom told me to go there. I didn't think it was gonna be as good as he said it would be, but man Im hooked on this place. The flavor in the food is so unique. The menu has such great variety. I had the Chimichanga Monday, Tuesday, I had the Ribs which were very good. Friday, I had the Beef Medallion with Chipotle Pasta, my Dad had the meatloaf. Their food is incredible. Anyone who doesn't give this place at least 4 stars, has no credibility when it comes to food. It is a 5 in my book. Can't wait to go again soon."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, and a whole lot of spicy food! This place has been around a long time and are always busy. No matter how busy, you get great service and the food is hot when it gets to your table. Excellent service and food! Great for groups!"}
{"text":"Super full on the weekends with mediocre food. I had the beef tacos. Nothing to jump up and down about. I service was scattered. Most likely won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, we were seated promptly and free chips and salsa came out! The salsa was amazing and a bit spicy, which is how I like it. I had the Double Stacked Enchiladas with Carne Adovada and it was delicious, especially the marinated beef! Additionally, the plate was pretty big and could have been easily split into two. The waitress was also very sweet and funny, providing us with great service. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this meal. Great service. The chips were good and the salsa was very tasty. The margarita on the rocks was pretty good. The stacked enchiladas with grilled pecan shrimp were very good. I would definitely return to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch based on good reviews.  I had a pork enchilada that was a daily special.  It was excellent and a good value for the price.  My wife had a hot/spicy soup which was also good.  The fresh salsa was addicting.  I give it 4 stars because so much of the menu includes soy, soy oil for frying etc...  which is an allergen for some.  5 stars if that doesn't bother you, but restaurants that use better oils will get higher marks from me and are often more conscientious about the quality of their ingredients."}
{"text":"My mom and I just happened to be on this side of town and were in need of a good dinner. My husband had brought home some food for me to try from here in the past, so I couldn't wait to try it out. The food was amazing. As soon as you walk in you smell the fire going and you just know that this food is going to be different than every other place out there. Just one look at the menu and we knew that we were in for a treat. The food exceeded our expectations, and we will be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious and the service is great.  Your drink never gets empty and the servers are always super friendly.  I love the enchiladas, one red and one green.  And the chips and salsa are great too!  Can't go wrong eating here."}

{"text":"Had the Spooning Rellenos, wonderful!! Waitress, Brianna the best!! Will come back next year!!"}
{"text":"I wish I was rating this place higher. However, lack of follow through from management leaves me no choice.

Quick review: Got a big group? Don't bother calling and setting things up with Dianna. You'll feel like second-class citizens. It's sad, really.

I knew something was wrong when I called on Wednesday to try and see if this place could accommodate our #evfn (East Valley Friday Nights) group. When I asked the person if they could accommodate 30 people, he suggested I call back and speak with Dianna the next day. Odd, but OK.

When I spoke with Dianna on Thursday, I explained that we'd be bringing 30 people for a combination of dinner and drinks. She readily agreed that they could handle such a crowd, and said she would be happy to reserve A) a section of the bar and B) a group of tables contiguous to the bar, as not everyone would be eating dinner. Great. Sounds perfect, as some of us like to mingle, and setting us in one long table doesn't help with that.

When we arrived at the schedule time, we found four small round tables pressed together near the bar, where a grand total of three chairs were unoccupied. You do the math. 30 people it was NOT going to accommodate.

As the attendees began filing in -- and the space quickly filled -- we spoke to the management (possibly Dianna, though she never identified herself) and secured another table near us that was soon to vacate. Another four-top.

As our numbers quickly swelled to the promised 30, there simply wasn't room. And this was around 6:30, so it's not as if we were early. Some of our late arrivals grabbed an available table -- only to be rather rudely told by management that the table had been reserved and that she had \"already informed them that there were no seats available.\". Great. So much for making room for the 30 we had spoken about.

In the end, we called it short an hour into the evening. Having the bartender also act as our server was a huge mistake. The boy did what he could, but there was no way he could keep up with the growing bar patrons -- not our people -- and our swelling numbers. So everything was delayed -- including out trying to get the hell out of there so the place could return to normalcy. I'd not be surprised if some tabs went unpaid. Unfortunate if it happened, but patience only lasts for so long. And remember that they AGREED to allow us to bring the event to their establishment.

The kicker? When one of our attendees mentioned that things weren't  going so well. Dianne's answer? \"I told the man who called that we couldn't handle this size of a group, but you all decided to come anyhow!\" 

So in the end, the shitty review. You'll probably see more. Up front I said this was unfortunate. And it's true, for the food was excellent. I had chili rellenos and was quite impressed. However, I'll never go back to this place because of bad service. And mind you, all of this was pre-arranged. We never went over our promised 30 people. Hell, they couldn't handle us when we were less than 20. It's not even communication failure. It's follow through failure.

So feel free to try this group when it's a party of 2. Anything larger... you're on your own. And forget reservations. And abandon the idea of talking to Dianna. She obviously isn't anyone who can follow through."}
{"text":"Blue Adobe.....

Oh where have you gone...

Let me just say this- I came here the first week they opened many years ago, my wife and I fell in love with the place.

Jose was the man!

Southwest chicken pasta was absolutely phenomenal.

But after eating there twice in the last year, I am no longer the fan I once was.

I hope they get back to their roots!!"}
{"text":"I struggle between 2 or 3 stars on this place.  It's a straight 2.5.  Nothing my husband  or I had was very good (ancho salmon with green chile and adobo) it all sounds good but definitely does not deliver. Disappointing but the chips and salsa and house margarita decent...and a cute place so 3 stars but that is pushing it."}
{"text":"Good was very very good. All the spices were really tasty. Nothing was too salty. Try the Salmon and the Shredded Beef mini Chimi. Both dishes were perfect!"}
{"text":"I admit to being a mexican food snob and a new mexican food appreciator. I was initially soured by the flavored iced tea. I ordered the meatloaf for something different... I certainly got something totally unexpected and it was a treat. The chorizo in the meatloaf was outstanding. It wasnt dense and heavy like moms... sorry ma! It was super tasty.. the potato pancake was a nifty spin on mashed potatoes. . So it wasn't the usual staple.. the veggies were also a surprise a nice wine finish was a great compliment. 
My partner in crime ordered the chorizo stuffed chicken breast. The sauce was the show stopper.. all in all it was a solid meal. I will crave that meatloaf.. so I will be back. Good job!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new and gave this place a try. The chips and salsa was really good! Service and atmosphere were also very good. Good was good but I they \"Sante fe\" style has never been my thing - so that might have something to do with it! I don't regret going but I also don't think that we will go back."}
{"text":"Went there for Dinner on a Friday night and I have to say I'm impressed by the quality of the food and the reasonable prices.  There's a great deal of variety and some creative New Mexican dishes.  I'd go so far as to say this is the best New Mexican restaurant in the East Valley!  Its not super spicy like Los Dos but there's a lot more flavor and you'll still feel the burn.

{"text":"Everything is simply fantastic! I had the corn chowder and and the chorizo stuffed chicken. So yummy."}

{"text":"Love the stacked enchiladas!  Guacamole is great! Actually all food is good!  Wait staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best restaurant in Mesa. Great New Mexican food and great staff. I've probably been here 10 times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent vibe and tasty food. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}

{"text":"I don't get the great reviews. While not bad, I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again . The chips are cold, salsa is blah to the max. The food is very pretty but lacking flavor except for the cheese crisp which is very tasty.  If you do go and have a choice between the red or green sauce, go red , the red has some good flavor to it, the green again is very blah"}
{"text":"Blue Adobe Grill isn't bad, but somehow, I'd prefer a chain Mexican food restaurant over this place.  Weird huh?  

I don't know, maybe it's the mix of Mexican/Southwestern food items and the way they add corn to everything- yick.  But there's just something about this place I don't like.  

My advice is to skip it if you already have some great Mexican spots that you really like going to."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT and you would never guess it from the outside! We were at the youth museum and were looking for a late lunch on a Sunday. This place was open and the yelp reviews looked pretty good! 

Service was excellent! The waiter suggested the seafood enchilada or the Laos combo. We ordered both so we could sample the top picks. The plates are plentiful-  we could have easily shared one and just had a salad with it. Great fresh flavors! The fresh salsa is wonderful - smoky chipotle and not too overly oniony. The seafood enchiladas had halibut and salmon inside and fresh salsa verde over the top. So yummy! The trio/combo plate came with a choice of verde or red sauce - we went for red, which was the spicier variant -it was so good! Beef tenderlion with melty cheese stuffed crispy relleno was to die for! I could eat that every day!! The shrimp enchilada was so good that even the five year old wanted some more. I took the pork tomale home to eat for dinner - couldn't finish my plate! 

They don't have a kids menu, but they do have a nice kids selection the waiter will tell you verbally. Cheese pizza, pasta or quesadilla. I think there were more offerings, but that's all the waiter could say before the 5YO made her selection.

I had the \"killer margarita\" (aka: the house margarita)  and was very happy with the fresh lime flavor. Sometimes, a house margarita just tastes like sweet and sour mix w/ triple sec - this one was refreshing and delish!

I would give it five stars, but there are two things lacking for a five star review: (1) the restaurant ambiance is a little underwhelming - the chairs and tables felt warn/old/cheap and you can't tell it's a great place from the outside decor. (2) food came out warm, not hot. But the flavors were so great that it won't stop us from coming back!

Fri/Sat are really busy here - the waiter said it's a really popular spot for large parties (20-40 people) - I will remember that in case we ever have a large group event!

We will definitely be back to this place! One of the BEST Mexican restaurants we've been to in the valley!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I think we came when they had the 'chef in training' on duty, because a seasoned chef would not have served the food that came out on my plate. Lets' be clear, the three stars I am giving this place is for the service, not the food. Our waiter was very nice and polite, and when I pointed out how dry and inedible my ribs were (at $16 for a half rack they should have been fall off the bone delicious), he immediately apologized and brought me the menu so I could pick something else out, which I did: The \"pecan crusted\" grilled chicken sandwich. I put \"pecan crusted\" in quotes because there was no sign of any pecans whatsoever. I don't know who decided to call it \"pecan crusted grilled chicken,\" but I think they need to have their eyes checked. It was simply a grilled chicken minus the \"pecan crusted.\" Now, I don't know what was going on in the kitchen, but the chef is either inexperienced, not too sharp, or just doesn't care about the quality of his food. Let's go back to the ribs for a sec. So the entree comes with their wedge salad, which consists of, at least on my plate, a wedge of ice berg lettuce, over cooked bacon bits, unripe avocado and some tomatoes thrown in for good measure, and oh, a dollop of their 'home made' ranch dressing (I don't believe for a second they make their own dressing. It tasted like every other mass produced dressing.) Let's just say for a second that I am no stranger to ribs; This was not my first rodeo. I know what to expect when I order ribs from a place: fall off the bone goodness. Not these ribs. They were over cooked and dry with very little seasoning or sauce; pretty flavorless and so dry I couldn't even eat them. I sent them back and got the chicken, which came minus the pecans. And I have to say that the chicken almost seemed like it was preformed (packaged??) But I ate it anyway along with more unripe avocado.

That explains the food. The inside of the place feels old and tired. It is in need of some decorating TLC, both inside and out. The exterior looks like an old fast food restaurant from the 80s. The booths are ancient and uncomfortable. The springs in the seats are worn so your butt sinks in and feels unsupported. I guess they don't want me to be too comfortable.

I truly don't understand the high ratings for this place. Either my standards are too high or everyone else's are way too low. And of course, I believe it to be the latter.  And for the record, the sign on the outside says \"New Mexican Cuisine.\" If you're looking for authentic MEXICAN cuisine, there are better choices in town."}
{"text":"My mom had purchased a Groupon for this place back in March and yesterday we were all deciding what sounded good for lunch. I suggested Mexican so then we were thinking which Mexican restaurant sounded good. (Living in AZ, you know there's MANY to choose from) So my mom suggested going to Blue Adobe so all of us headed there. 

My mom, my dad, my sister, my nephew, and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had the Triple Stack of New Mexican style Enchiladas. One shredded beef and two Carne Adovada. It was SO delicious! The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other. My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it. My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those. And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldn't stop saying how tasty they were. And my 5 year old nephew loved his kids cheese enchilada. Our server was named Travis and he was great as well. Phenomenal service. Even if Travis had been sub-par, I would still give this place 5 Stars because that's just how good the food is."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for flavorful seafood and fabulous service. Won't break the bank. Remember that Sundays are \"Any of the specials of the week\" for $10. You've GOT to try it for that price! Go local!"}
{"text":"Best calamari I've ever had!  Love the house margaritas and chips and salsa. The ancho Salmon dish is superb and on special one day of the week but I can't remember which day.  You will love Blue Adobe Grill if you give it a try."}
{"text":"Truly excellent New Mexico cuisine. The Carne Adovada  was insanely good, as was the portobello mushroom enchildas. My husband had the ribs and they were outstanding. This place was so good, we went back again the next night. And don't miss their crème brûlée."}
{"text":"So delicious!! Land of Enchantment was perfect. Service is amazing and everyone is so nice! Will definitely come back. Long drive for me, 45 miles, and so worth it!"}
{"text":"Hello Yelpers ,

Ok... So you know how we all watch those food tv shows like CHECK PLEASE Arizona and the food always looks amazing and their service is impeccable???

I guess the only way to get that amazing food and impeccable service is to be a critic for a food show!

Of course when cameras go into a restaurant everything is going to look and taste great... Unless you have cameras rolling...  It is my opinion that you GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!

I made a reservation to celebrate my friends birthday for Sunday morning.

I told the girl it was a celebration and she assured me it was noted and will be acknowledged.

Arriving first, I AGAIN reminded the hostess about the birthday and again she assured me it was  noted.

Friends arrived and as we looked at the specials my friends told me how they have been to the BLUE ADOBE in Scottsdale and therefore she was able to make recommendations.

I was prepared for bad service as the reviews made that clear...

The server arrived acting like she was working in some 50's diner where inappropriate behavior was acceptable.. As she rushed us thru ordering ... She referred to one of us as \"stripes\"... Yes... She was wearing a striped shirt... But REALLY?

If that wasent UNPROFESSIONAL enough after taking our order she put our bill in the table....

We just ordered.... Who puts the bill on the table before you eat??

Who was this woman and why is she working there? 

We ordered a lobster dip which took quite a while to get it and when we did we all just looked at eachother.. 

It was in a tiny bowl and was liquidy and had a cheese hunk of stuff just clumped in the middle...

My friend orders this all the time at the Scottsdale location and said at the other location it is served on a black hot plate and the serving is twice what we got..

Did I mention this dip is $10.00!!!!!

We returned it as we all agreed it was pretty gross.

Our server was obviously perturbed and her actions made this clear.

The restaurant was fairly empty so I am not sure why we could never find her.

We ordered the lazy tacos which were good... Not great...

Chili rellanos which is deep fried not in an egg wash but the cheese was hot and good.

I ordered the chili rellanos burger... MEDIUM RARE. ... Which needless to say was served well done, I had no choice but to ask them to make another... Just can't eat well done meat.

When they brought the new burger it was done just fine but the fries were from the first order and served cold!!!  REALLY?

I do have to say the burger had a wonderful flavor

Nothing tasted the same as Scottsdale location so we asked the server if they are same owner .

One server said SCOTTSDALE LOCATION IS A KNOCK OFF\" of theirs??

We didn't have to worry about getting the check because it daunted us all thru our meal sitting there on the a table.

We paid and asked for change for a twenty and the server brought no singles!!

REALLY?? Did she really think she deserved a $10 tip on a $40 dollar bill?? NOT!!

I had told the birthday girl that I made them aware of her birthday 3 times!!! 

So we decided if her birthday was acknowledged we would tip 20% ... If not 15%

Of course nobody did anything!

I never would have gone to this restaurant if I had not seen it on CHECK PLEASE. 

And we will NEVER be back!

I hope the owner of this restaurants actually reads these reviews to better their business because they lost our business!

If you are going to try BLUE ADOBE... GO TO THE SCOTTSDALE LOCATION for the best service and better tasting food.. Same menu and price.

Wherever you go or whatever you do, remember to smile and enjoy... You only live once!

Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"Great service! Please order chips and salsa! The salads are amazing! Honestly,
you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place, and eating here did not disappoint! For starters, my friend and I had 2 mimosas. Added fruit to the drink just made it even tastier. My friend noted that the drinks weren't \"strong\" so the waiter gave us 2 free extra drinks! For an appetizer, we ordered a $6 red velvet pancake with cream cheese icing on top. This is one of the better pancakes I had. I could eat this everyday for breakfast! The next item we had was the tenderloin enchiladas! We ordered the double stacked for $12.95. Next off we had the $9.95 Blue Adobe Burger. This is ranked in Phoenix \"top 10 burgers.\" My favorite part was the red velvet cake! Superb dish that I will have to come back for again! Yum! What a great \"New Mexican\" experience!

Note: The beans, rice, and fries are just average."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited Arizona for her birthday just a couple weeks ago. We decided to try this place out as it was close to our hotel, had good reviews, and was something we wouldn't get in Illinois. 

Environment-wise, the restaurant is adorable. They do have a bar and a few TV's, but nothing overbearing if that's not what you're there for. 

Our waiter (I believe his name was Dan or Dane) was extremely nice and clearly has the personality for great customer service. He knew everything about items on the menu and was able to make great recommendations. He checked up on us frequently but not too frequently and never seemed to try to rush us after we finished eating and talked a little which was a pleasant surprise!

The food was delicious! I had the ancho salmon with a strawberry frozen killer margarita. I believe my sister had an enchilada and a mango frozen killer margarita. We also had the triple dipper as an appetizer. Everything tasted wonderfully and I would easily recommend any of those to anyone. 

All in all, this place was a great choice. Only wish I could have it, again, now that I'm back in Illinois!"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant we tried when we moved to Arizona.  It was absolutely delicious.  This place serves New Mexico cuisine, which is a world away from your average Mexican food oozing in cheese and red sauce.

The carne adovada sliders are to die for!  The slow cooked spicy meat is nestled between a fried tortilla cut to look like little burger sliders.  It's served on top of a bed of lettuce and is enough food to be a meal than just an appetizer.  My husband consistently order the Jala Holla steak with its jalapeno hollandaise sauce.  My friend loved her green chili crab dip served with fresh tortilla chips.  This place has pretty good fresh fruit margaritas.  I really loved the mango margaritas!

I really liked the one in Mesa, but the neighborhood borders on sketchy.  I tried the one in Scottsdale when it first opened and it wasn't as good as the Mesa branch.  However, when we moved to North Phoenix, we settled on going to the one on Frank Lloyd Wright.   The chef owner is very pleasant and has remembered us in both locations!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's not traditional Senora Mexican food nor is it like any New Mexico fair I have previously had. It is delicious.  The have great options like the Chip Chop Salad I had with melt in your mouth pork or the double stack enchiladas with rice and beans my hubby had. The chips have a crispness that's hard to explain - they are neither to thick nor too thin. I loved them. The salsa they put on the table is very tasty and very spicy. They also have flatbread pizzas on the menu.

I also really like the atmosphere of this restaurant.  It's clean and welcoming.  I will be going back here very soon."}
{"text":"Had lunch here again yesterday. The outside of the building is deceiving, as the interior is nicely decorated and offers a dark, modern, comfortable atmosphere. The menu is unique and exciting. They offer lunch sized portions and heartier dinner sized portions.

Their southwest pork tenderloin (i think it was a dinner special one night) was a real treat, and the chimis are perfection. Definitely request their \"hotter\" salsa."}
{"text":"This place is great, It was the first place i dined when I moved to the valley and i continue to go back. The food is outstanding and the service is great. I always get the enchiladas and my girlfriend always goes with the salmon. She always says its the best fish in town, and after trying it she is right. If you want great food and service at a reasonable price go with the blue adobe. Also, they have some of the best chips and salsa."}
{"text":"High end New Mexican cuisine.  Very spicy and very good.  Would recommend to anyone who likes a spicy meal."}
{"text":"Slow service, small table and the table next to us screaming out obscenities obviously a couple to drinks too many. Food was ok but steak was rare order medium rare. Thanks for the birthday dinner Blue Adobe."}
{"text":"Great meatloaf! Who would have thought?  the wait was long even with a reservation, but the food was exceptional.  The potato pancake that accompanied the generous portion of meatloaf and perfectly cooked mixed veg was worth its own review.  Among the best house magaritas I've had.  This is where you take your Midwestern visitors when they ask for something southwest and local."}
{"text":"This place has the best tenderloin rellenos and chimichangas I've ever had. Great service and wonderful food all around... YUMM!!"}
{"text":"We chose this place after an extraordinary experience at the Blue Adobe Sante Fe Grille on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd in Scottsdale.  I believe the two were once one and split off to two different owners and somewhat similar menus.

This was okay - but not nearly as good as our experience at the Scottsdale restaurant.  We even ordered that sounded like the same plate we loved in Scottsdale, but neither  the tenderloin stuffed chili relleno nor the smoked pork tamale compared taste wise to the same items on the \"Cruz Kitchen\"  plate at the Blue Adobe Sante Fe Grille.

We'd probably go back if in Mesa, but I'd find something else to order.  I saw another review of their pozole - which I love - but didn't see on the menu this time.  With any luck......."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to get their adobada pork. This place has the most amazing adobada pork entree. It is enough for two meals and is totally worth the price.

The smoked peppers/chipotle or hatch peppers makes it spicy but not so much that you're pouring with sweat. The salsa is a bit spice-LESS so I wouldn't have a problem letting an 80 year old guest of mine with no tolerance for spice eat it. It's tasty, just not spicy at all.

If you aren't satisfied with the spice from the salsa, just wait. Each entree I had came with s unique kick of its own. Te salsa then became a nice \"cooler\" for the heat.

Service is good. Typical well known \"been there forever\" restaurant level of service. Could be more efficient but not bad to the point where it affects the meal. Just remember that you're there for the food and not necessarily structured wait staff.  I really like this place for a great meal."}
{"text":"We went on a Wed evening around 6:30 and were seated immediately.  I've had lunch here before, but this is the first time going for dinner -- and once again, the BAG didn't disappoint.  This is New Mexico cuisine at its finest.   As others have mentioned the dark, smoky chipotle salsa is like nothing I've ever tasted.  Having lived in AZ all my life, I've had just about every variant of salsa out there, and this is simply one of the best. 

We started with the \"jimmy crack corn crab cakes \" and were delighted with the 4 generously-sized cakes served on a bed of greens and a drizzle of a cilantro-based sauce.  

For an entree, I chose the Taos combo, which included a pork tamale, tenderloin relleno, and shrimp enchilada.  I can't say enough about the quality of this meal.  It's impossible for me to choose a favorite between the relleno and enchilada - both were outstanding.   

Great atmosphere (don't be fooled by the exterior), incredible food.  The Blue Adobe consistently provides a great dining experience.

One final note: for those in the group of 30 who were unhappy with their accommodations, was it really necessary for so many of you to give this place a low rating?  Seems disingenuous to dog-pile on like that."}
{"text":"A totally unexpected delight of a place. Besides the great service and kind of funky but fun atmosphere, the food was simply outstanding. We tried the appetizer plate with shirmp, lobster fundito, and crab cakes. All three were excellent as were the chips served for dipping in the fundito. Speaking of chips, the normal house chips and bean dip were very good. Now, to the main course, we shared a rack of ribs figuring that we'd eat half and bring the rest home. Wrong, we brought far more than half home. A great sized serving and delicious. While we finished off the side salad at the restaurant, we brought home lots of great ribs, at least four meals worth. And, they actually got a bit better with time. This is a place that is way above the norm for \"Mexican\" here in the valley or for New Mexican or Southwestern or whatever term you want to use. Forget the label and just hie thee to Blue Adobe for a great meal."}
{"text":"Can I get away with a second raving about The Original Blue Adobe? Who cares? Switched up on my usual carne rellenos and went with the shrimp. Nothing less than perfection on a plate. Underlying smokiness had me staring at my plate mouthful upon mouthful. Add the lava flow of silky, unctuous cheese I chose to scoop up with crunchy corn chips, along with perfect and just-rightly-seasoned rice and beans and, well... seconds? More, please!"}
{"text":"I love Blue Adobe Grille  when I'm in the Mesa area.  Yes the outside is pretty scary looking with real estate for sale signs everywhere and most things closed in the vicinity. Once you get into the place however it's nice and relaxing.  The chips and salsa they serve are very fresh, and they also had a couple of good micro brews on tap which is better than at most Mexican places.  The people behind the bar area are super nice and don't rush you.  I'm one of those people who order things differently than what they offer on the menu, and this place does a great job of accommodating me. One of my favorites is their veggie enchilada, but what I have them do is stack them on blue corn and have them come with the spicy red sauce.  I also get their side spinach salad which is a small extra fee.  The dish also comes with whole beens and rice.  All I can say is the flavors of spices they use make the dish really good.  I know there are as good places if you go to Santa Fe, NM, but as far as in AZ and In CA this place is tops."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3, my husband would give it a 5, so I settled on a 4.

The salsa you get with your chips is really tasty.
The drinks were very good.
My husband got the ribs. We would both say that the plate was excellent.

I got the chorizo stuffed chicken. While it tasted great, the chicken was VERY dry. It would truly benefit from an hour of brining. Also, I'm guessing they add while wine to the sauteed vegetables, to me it tasted too winey. The booze flavor didn't cook off. I just think they used too much. truthfully good sauteed vegetables don't need any wine.

My husband got a skinny margarita, he loved it.

I know we'll go back, but I wouldn't try the chicken again. It was so dry it tasted chalky. It's too bad because the cheese and chorizo filling was fantastic."}
{"text":"My family and I went to eat at this place the other night. It was my husband and is first time eating here and we had heard decent things about it so we were kind of excited to see what it was about. At first the chips were stale. Then we ordered guacamole and it looked really good...except there was a live fly in it. They comped us for it and apologized. I ordered a margarita and it took almost 20 minutes for me to receive it! It looked and tasted pretty average, nothing amazing. My husband ordered a burger medium well to be slightly pink. When he bit in the entire inside was red! Not pink but red! I should have taken a picture..
My mom found a bone in her fish and the soup I ordered was barely warm. The tortilla it came with was pretty chewy like a store bought brand. I didn't finish it. We all were extremely disappointed in the food...one thing after another..it was discouraging. We left about $40+ out of pocket and still hungry. 
We will not be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to go somewhere different for dinner tonight and Blue Adobe Grill did not disappoint!! The service was amazing and we had the best seats in the house! I ordered the chimichelada and he had the lobster tamales. We both liked my meal the best. We will definitely return! Great service, food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience here....food fresh and diverse palate...service very attentive and pleasant... ambiance is ++++and price very competitive....menu is pleasant and friendly to the eyes...a must for those who love New Mexico dishes... also have other dishes with a New Mexican touch... love this place !!!"}
{"text":"Came here a dozen years ago and wasn't impressed, didn't return until a friend claimed they just served him the best burger he ever had.  I went with him and was amazed. Went back with my wife and was blown away trying other items on the menu.  I keep coming back and brining others--no one leaves disappointed."}
{"text":"Me thinks that the folks who wrote the glowing reviews about this food had spent too long at a bar stool.  \"Different\" is how they described the food-  my word of choice would be \"goofy\".  Why take perfectly good Mexican food and mess it up just to be \"different\"?  The positive side was that the service was excellent and the premises clean."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday dinner with some friends and loved it!!  Food was great and server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Will be going back there is a lot more on their menu I want to try!"}
{"text":"First time we walked in and that was a mistake because it was going to be over an hour wait. Second time we were smart and made a reservation just to go and it be pretty empty. Based on all the reviews we expected this place to knock our socks off. Unfortunately I left disappointed. Service was great. Our server was a really nice guy, can't recall his name but he knew the menu very well. It always impresses me when a server doesn't have to write down everyone's orders and just remembers them. 
I ordered the Land of Enchantment. It was the best of all worlds. Filet. Shrimp. Enchilada. Husband ordered the Carne Adovada Christmas style  and we started with guac. 
You get chips and salsa to munch on. I don't know if we had a bland batch but the salsa has no flavor what so ever. It looked like it was full of chilis and spice but nothing. The guac was delicious. It was chunky with chunks of avocado and jalapeños and onions. So good. 
Then food came out. Husbands carne adovada Christmas style was very good. My meal however was a fail. 
I ordered my steak medium rare. But it came back well done. Again. No flavor on the shrimp or the beef. Potatoes were orange. No flavor. Vegetables were carrots and zucchini and they tasted like alcohol. Not sure if they cook them in a wine or what but they didn't cook the alcohol of them. My husband just sniffed a carrot and was shocked of the smell. 
Server was kind to apologize for the steak. Then whom I believe was the MOD came by and said \"you're steak is well done?\" I agreed and she just took the plate. 10-15 mins later I got a new plate. Steak again was well done. Server again apologized. I said it was fine and I will just eat it. About halfway through the MOD made her rounds again and asked how it was. Told her it was edible. She asked if it was too rare. I said no. Well done again. She then argued with me. Saying that's how they do medium well there. Ok great. But I ordered it medium rare. She continued to argue that's not how I told her to cook it. But reality is she never asked how I wanted it when she took it away. Then proceeded to argue about it more. Finally I was just like it's fine. I'm going to eat it. Don't worry about it. She then said she will take it off my bill. It wasn't necessary because I told her I still was going to eat it. But she still took it off. 
Ugh. I was perfectly content with the server acknowledging and apologizing for the overcooked steak. But the MOD just made the situation worse. 

So in the end. Food was bland. Service was decent. But overall just disappointing."}
{"text":"Ok.. so I saw quite a few Blue Adobe to Dick's Hideaway comparisons in the reviews. Dick's Hideaway is my favorite Arizona Restaurant, so I had to give it a shot. I pulled into an empty parking lot.. not a good sign. Walked into an empty restaurant.. another bad sign. I was worried that maybe I had selected a dud for the date night I had set up with my fiance who was meeting me there. I sat down, and immediately ordered a carafe of margarita. Then I watched my server pour a shit load of booze into the carafe, before adding his other flavors.. a great sign! Pamela showed up, to a glass full of potent, and tasty margarita.. and some of the better chips and salsa I have had. 

Our waiter, who was awesome btw.. recommended the Carne Adovada Enchiladas. This is what I ordered. Pamela got the Oscar Medallion: A small steak with crab meat on top of it, served with pasta and asparagus.

My enchiladas were legit. Tender pork, delicious chili sauce. Cheesy, meaty, tortilla-y goodness. Highly recommended. Pamela's steak was perfectly cooked, and was butter knife slice able. The crab on top was a nice touch. The pasta however, was a real miss. It was a super limp, greasy mess on the plate. Very heavy.. not appetizing. Neither me, or my fiance cared for it. 

Back to the Margaritas. I am not big on margaritas. They sometimes give me heart burn. Blue Adobe Grille's Killer Margarita was great. That carafe got my chick drunk. It got me a little tipsy, and I can hold my own. It was tasty. Not too sour. Not too sweet. No chest pain.

I am not sure why this place was empty. My friend told me that when he had visited, it smelled like a mop and bucket inside. It smelled fine in there to me. I did notice complaining about his in other reviews though. Minus the pasta, my experience was awesome. I will be back to explore their very affordable menu. Maybe drink some margaritas, and watch he game at the bar-"}
{"text":"Excellent every time. Its too bad we live so far away or we would come more. Green corn chowder is great. Spooning rellenos have tenderloin, cheese, and chorizo with red or green sauce. My wife had the chimichanga which was really good as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The ancho salmon is amazing, and you can't go wrong with anything adovado."}
{"text":"So Good!!!  I had a make-my-own combo plate of a Cheese Chile relleno, a tenderloin taco, and the house specialty carnitas.  My husband had stacked shrimp enchiladas.  Everything from the chips and salsa to the rice and beans was flavor-packed, unique, and downright delicious.  The hostess gave us a choice of three tables, telling us which was the quietest (in a bustling atmosphere) and our server answered our questions and gave us just the perfect amount of attention.  Even the ice was crushed to perfection! I am writing this review before leaving the table ...as my husband is saying, \"I don't think anything could have been better!!\"  I agree!  A gem in Mesa...just as advertised!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty 
Had a Caesar with Salmon 
Son had a burger
Casual atmosphere 
Ok service 
Would come back"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal at the Blue Adobe , we were in Phoenix from out of town and decided to give it a try. The service was fast and friendly and we all loved our food. The Halibut with Jalapeno Hollandaise was exceptional. We will definitely be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Adobada is ah-mazing! Wedge Salad is also really good. Kinda felt like I was in Santa Fe for a bit...I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"While some of the food was very tasty, the oil used to fry the food tasted rancid or at the very least, needed to be changed for fresh oil. Many of the items on the menu looked interesting so maybe I need to give Blue Adobe another try."}
{"text":"For my birthday dinner, I wanted something I hadn't had in a long time - added bonus that it was a new experience for my husband.  After dropping our daughter off at Grandma's House for the night, my hubby and I scooted over to Blue Adobe. 

The place isn't much to look at - this section of Mesa has been hit hard by economic hard times and residents that don't give a rip about their surroundings.  It's a quaint little building and lo and behold, a barbecue joint is next door - not sure when that happened.

We walked in and were immediately greeted.  The woman even guessed who I was, based on a phone call I made there and hour and a half earlier.  It was a crowded Friday night and almost every table was filled except one in the middle - ours!

Our waitress was immediately at our table asking for our drink order.  My husband asked for her recommendation and she had several.  for me - it was hard to decide between one of the pasta dishes; the chimi or the Carne Adovada.  In the end, the adovada won!!  

It didn't take us long to notice the deftness of the staff.  Almost IMMEDIATELY after a party left a table, a young man swooped in and prepared the table for the next diners - maybe 30 seconds flat!  He was also quick to fill our glasses of water and remove unwanted dishes off our table.  

The salsa was a nice break from traditional Mexican salsa.  It had a deeper, richer flavor to it - smokey and complex.  The chips were perfectly seasoned - not to salty, not too bland.  Nice thickness on them as well (I can't stand thick chips!!)

When our entrees arrived, we were ready to face the fire!  My husband's Taos Combo had a pork tamale, a tenderloin relleno and a shrimp enchilada.  It was a great way to be introduced to New Mexican cuisine.  I had a bite of the enchilada and the relleno - the tenderloin in the relleno had a deep smokey flavor.

My Carne Adovada was incredible! Such complexity!  The heat snuck up on you and surrounded you - not a bad heat like eating a habanero, but a rich heat that built up over time.  The meat was tender and flaky and smothered in that deep red/brown sauce.  The rice had that same distinct New Mexican richness to it that traditional \"Mexican\" or \"Tex Mex\" doesn't offer.  My only complaint was the lack of a vegetable.  I would have preferred something like a succotash or even just some diced tomatoes instead of beans.  We ended up asking for some sour cream to tame the heat a little and what ended up happening (for me anyway) was that the sour cream accentuated the deep complexity of the spices - I tasted more of the preparation behind the adovada.  

My husband ordered a \"birthday treat\" for us - the pumpkin brulee, which is only available during November (yay for having a November birthday!).  We wondered if we were going to be able to eat it - what with feeling like we just ran into a wall with all that good adovada and tamales in our bellies, but we were both surprised how much we powered through that brulee.  It was perfectly done - PERFECT!!  The pumpkin flavor was obvious without being overbearing.  It was surprisingly light."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and it did not disappoint.  We were a party of 4 (all first timers) left very happy and very full.  The food selection was varied and I felt like I could have picked 8-10 options from the menu and been very happy.  We will definitely be going back when we're on that side of the town again.  Great find!"}
{"text":"Great date spot with a killer Chimichanga; the only downfall to the meal would have been the less than stellar meatloaf, but meatloaf is hit or miss anyway. Either way this is the best true Tex-Mex in Az, and the best \"Near Mexican\" food that you can find in the area that doesn't get served to you from over a counter. 
I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a mexican food fix or to impress a date."}
{"text":"Blue Adobe has become one of our favorite restaurants. Their daily specials are always my go to, either the Ancho Salmon, Chorizo Stuffed Chicken or the Stacked Enchiladas! The salsa is one of the best around also! I highly recommend checking this place out if you are looking for good food, and a local spot!"}
{"text":"We went here on Cinco de Mayo. Fortunately, I was able to make a reservation for 4 two hours in advance.

When we got there and found that the food was Southwestern/New Mexico style instead of Mexican, I had mixed emotions. On the one hand, Yelp said this was Mexican food, and it was definitely New Mexico-inspired, Hatch chile-laden cuisine. However, we just got back from Santa Fe and Albuquerque a few weeks ago and were eager to get some more of the cuisine we had there.

I have two friends that ripped Blue Adobe Grill to shreds with their reviews, mostly because of the service. Fortunately, I didn't have 30 people in my party, so the service was a bit better. But to say it was great would definitely be lying. Service was slow but adequate...and probably cost this rating the fifth star.

But the food was absolutely incredible. All four of us were impressed! The chiles made the food spicy hot...but not at the expense of flavor. The meats in our dishes were incredibly tender, including the shrimp in my enchilada. Shrimp is so often overcooked and tough...but not this dish.

Additionally...some of the best chips and salsa you'll ever eat is right here. 

If you're used to Taco Bell...skip this place. But if you like good food, spicy food, and don't mind being a little patient with service...this is the place."}
{"text":"I went here tonight with the BF to use a Groupon.... what a disappointment! I had heard that this place was so good... but really.... not awesome. The chips and salsa were ok, but not anything too special. I started with the supposedly amazing corn chowder.... bland and the chicken in it had a weird texture. Not my cup of tea... or soup, as it were. I ordered the double stack pork adovado enchiladas 'christmas' style... with green and red sauce. Well.... I'm not sure if there was any sauce on it.... there certainly wasn't any spice, I thought it was New Mexican food? No flavor or spice here. The pork was ok.... but again, not very flavorful. The BF just got a cheese crisp. It was soggy, flavorless, and pathetic. If it is an old family recipe, as the menu claims.... that family is probably pretty boring. To top it all off, the service was sloooow. I will not be back, sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Veggie enchiladas were delicious!  So many great options on the menu from tacos to seafood to salads........fast and fresh too!"}
{"text":"We've been going to the Blue Adobe for about 5 years.  Don't be fooled by the restaurant's exterior appearance.  The interior is dark and intimate, and the food is outstanding.  Our favorites are the spooning rellenos (the best I've ever had), salmon tacos, and carne adovada.  The fire roasted salsa and margaritas are also fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  I ordered the Oceanside, New Mexico.. All I can say is WOW!!  It was a shrimp chili relleno with mango salsa and a crab tamale with raspberry  Chipotle sauce.  It had so much flavor, so delicious!  Also had a mango killer margarita..Amazing!  My new favorite place to go!!"}
{"text":"It's now 8 years later, and I now have 248 Yelp check-ins here. We are basically here every Friday night, at the bar, and occasionally other nights such as when we have friends or family visiting from out of town. Still hasn't gotten old after all this time. My latest favorite: shrimp tacos, but ordered blackened rather than just grilled. Not on the menu that way but they'll gladly make them so. I then add some of the outstanding fresh salsa that's served with the chips and they're absolutely superb."}
{"text":"Food and service was very good. I would have given 4 stars but the chips weren't the best. They tasted a little stale. Other than that it was excellent. I think we will be back. Chimichanga with green sauce was Delish!"}
{"text":"This is a mixed report, since I loved my shredded beef chimichanga and my wife hated her Chorizo Stuffed Chicken with Green Chile Potato & Sautéed Vegetables.  She said it had no taste. (She also hated her marguerita and didn't drink more than a few sips. Bad night for her.)

My chimichanga , however, was very tasty, with red chili sauce providing the perfect amount of tongue-tingling spice. They had Four Peaks Kilt Lifter on tap, which cut the spice nicely. And the salsa they brought was really good, though the red chips, for some reason, were all stale. 

The place was more of a bar with tables than a restaurant, strictly speaking. Nothing fancy. But a nice menu of New Mexican favorites. I'd probably go again if I come back to town. (My wife, though...I'm thinking probably not.)"}
{"text":"Land of enchantment was great!! Steak super tender...chicken enchilada was super flavorful and delicious.  Grilled veggies also excellent!! Shrimp slightly overcooked and not all that flavorful or would have gotten 5 stars..good chips n salsa too!!!"}
{"text":"Blue Adobe is a great little find in Mesa.  I'd highly recommend to give the Carne Adovada and Blue Seafood Enchiladas a try.  They are both awesome and and have a unique flavor.  I typically end up here for work events; if you need to host some traveling guests and want to find an interesting place where you can still talk over dinner, this is a good spot.

Okay, I have to mention a few other dishes, give the Ancho Chile Rubbed Salmon a try if you like Salmon, it was so tender and really well seasoned last time I was in.  And for dessert try the Creme Brulee, I know this is one of those typical items, but it's pretty darn good here.  In fact, try everything on their menu, I could go on and on, so many solid interesting items, in good portions and with unique flavors.  This is a great little spot and will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Lucky for my hubby and I, the first New Mexican restaurant that we were going to go to was closed so we ended up at Blue Adobe.  The previous Yelpers warned me not to worry about the neighborhood and exterior of the building so we didn't and proceeded.  It was a wonderfully clean and smelled intoxicating!

I ordered the green chile chicken corn chowder and the lobster tamale and portabella mushroom enchilada with an amaretto mushroom cream sauce.  The corn chowder was fantastic!  It was presented beautifully and was delicious.  Okay, enough of that...let me say that I can't imagine ever ordering anything but that mushroom enchilada again!!!  The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed in butter and the amaretto sauce is something I never would have dreamed up.  Incredible!

My husband ordered the Red Chile Pork Posole soup and a combo platter that had a bunch of different stuff on it that I couldn't pay any attention to.  I was too full even before finishing my own meal.  He did say that it was really good and would come back again.

Oh yeah, the Peach sangria was the strongest sangria I've ever had.  It had peach schnapps in it...a lot!  Well worth $7.00."}
{"text":"Amazing! the hotel and Yelp rated this high and I am sure glad we went to try it.  I was a little skeptical at first because the waiter talks like Stevie Nicks sings.  He gave me the Happy Hour options twice, but I couldn't quite catch them so I ordered the house margarita ($4).  The salsa was spicy, fire roasted. Not my cup of tea, but my husband vouched for it as true New Mexico fare.  Not to worry, had the rubbed ribs (the waiter had trouble understanding ME when I ordered) and they were stunningly good.  The half rack was piled high, the cornbread sweet and spicy and the wedge salad amazing.  Can't remember when all the things on my plate were that good.  Although the waiter seemed diffident and unfriendly, I have to admit the service was very good.  My husband had the chile relleno (sp?)  with shrimp and cheese, both sauces and they were to die for.  I'd go back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next."}
{"text":"Delicious complimentary salsa. Got the dip trio and the bean dip was the star of the show. I had the Taos combo with green sauce (chile relleno, tamale and enchilada) and it was amazing. I always love Mexican rice, but theirs was to die for! Will definitely try Blue Adobe for breakfast next time around."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some delicious New Mexican food, THIS is the place to go! The portion sizes seem small, but in reality, they're perfect; especially following a round of yummy chips and salsa. As an appetizer, we ordered a Mexican pizza with green chilis (not on the menu, but pretty much a staple anywhere), which was a great way to start off the meal. As an entree, I ordered the beef chimichanga. The beans and rice were fantastic; lots of flavor, and the chimichanga was amazing! It was nice and crisp, and the beef was shredded perfectly (no chunks, gross...). For a table of four, the prices were good, and the service was even better. We had a fantastic waiter who was very much on top of everything we needed, and was very fast. One recommendation: make sure to make a reservation. We didn't have a reservation and ended up waiting about an hour before being seated."}
{"text":"I gave 4/5 stars because everything was good except the chips and salsa. I got the Marsala enchiladas and they were absolutely amazing! We beat the crowd but even after they got their lunch rush of people our waiter was still very attentive :-) friendly staff, good portion sizes and great place to check out!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, and the decor was cute. I had the chorizo stuffed chicken, and it came with a green chili potato which was my favorite part of the dish. My margarita was ok, I've had better. The service was a little slow. It took a while for our server to come over, and we had to remind him to bring out out appetizer. And we had to ask for silverware and napkins after our entree was brought out."}
{"text":"A very unique experience. New favorite place to eat. 

My wife and I went here because we wanted to celebrate her graduation. Corrine was our server and had great recommendations for what we would want. She was so fast to take care of all of our needs and had a lot of great bussers filling water and drinks. Our drinks did not go even half full. 

I had the stacked shrimp enchiladas with red and green sauce and a fried egg on top. It was flavorful and smokey. 

My wife had the mini chimi and mushroom enchilada. She loved it and we we filled so we took some home. 

Chips and salsa were very flavorful. New favorite."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and loved it.  I had the combo plate...lobster tamale, salmon taco and shrimp enchilada.  If I had the room I would have finished it.  Next time I'm skipping the chips and salsa.  My boyfriend had the Oscar filet...  It was cooked perfectly.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm actually pretty impressed with Blue Adobe. I have to say, after eating there at least a dozen more times, I loved it more and more. It wasn't as loud, even though it was busy. I frequently got the blue seafood enchiladas and the ancho chile rubbed salmon, both are to die for."}
{"text":"My wife and I are in town to visit our son. We're not real familiar with the area. So after getting on yelp and look around I found The Blue Adobe. 
It was conveniently located two blocks from where we are staying. 
We made reservations for 5 and were promptly seated. We had to wait a little bit for our son Cz he just got off work and was making his way to where we were. I got a little impatient Cz I felt we were just taking up space that could be used for other customers. But the server made us feel right at home and told us not to worry. Our son finally arrived and we ordered. 
This place is remarkable. The interior decor isn't tacky or blah. But tastefully done with menu suggestions around the establishment. Even in the restroom. 
I ordered the ancho chili rubbed ribs. Wow this plate straight up rocked. The meat was so tender and flavorful. It came with salad and cornbread that had green chili in it. I couldn't say enough abt the dish to the server. Which by the way the service was excellent. It's a shame I don't live here. Because I would be here all the time. Especially since they have TV's for Sunday football! So if ur in the area be sure and eat here. U will not be disappointed.
Well I feel the need to update this review. Being that our room is so close to the restaurant. We decided to eat dinner here again. I had the Carne Avodada. This dish was excellent. But what I need to add that I forgot last night. Was that the service is kinda slow. Tonight was blatantly obvious. It wasn't that crowded. I even noticed how impersonal the server was. I commented twice how good the food was and the guy was stone faced. Seriously?  Idk maybe he don't like his job. But when u deal with customers. At least smile."}
{"text":"Blue Adobe Grille had great reviews and I was looking forward to some classic New Mexican food.  I saw a lot of good reviews on their seafood, so we all gave it a shot. I think maybe they had a bad cook that day, but all the seafood was way overcooked.  Even the pork tacos were so overcooked, my friend gave the order back to the restaurant.  We went on a Friday nights, so its quite surprising."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! 

Watch out for this place being packed at certain times of the year. If we drive by and see people out front, we pick another restaurant. If it looks quiet, we go in for dinner and have a great meal. 

One night in particular, we were seated immediately, waited on attentively, served steaming hot (delicious) food, given our bill, and checked out in less than 30 minutes. It was an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Business trip=loser, trying amazing restaurants while on a business trip=WINNER! This place was beyond outstanding! 

First this is not Mexican food, which I was glad about because really, I live next door to Costa Mexico (Mesa) so I don't need to fly to Arizona to eat Mexican. But I will fly to Arizona to have this amazing food from New Mexico! In fact I may move here to eat this food, this is how much I loved ever single bite.

I had a margarita and loved it. I ordered a plate that had the chili relleno, tamale, enchilada and rice and beans on it. I never, ever order chili rellenos but this woman next to us kept raving about it so I figured if I got it as part of a combo plate, I would not be stuck feeling sad I didn't order something else. My god I am so glad I listened to that big mouth customer; it was the best chili relleno I have ever had in my life.
I don't know what the boss ordered but whatever it was, I tried it and it was equally outstanding.

The boss and I tried to quit eating when we were full and we could not so we rolled out of the restaurant, down the tarmac and flew back home in our food comas and lived to tell about it..."}
{"text":"Had not been here in a while stopped in and was surprised at the lack of customer service. I sat down at the bar and watched nine people shuffle around and not one looked up to greet me or say hello. After several minutes the bartender with at least a pleasant smile came over to take my order but I had some questions about happy hour that we're not clearly explained. When my bill arrived and I clarified the owner, Vicky, stepped in and was so brash I could not wait to leave. Bummer this is what blue Adobe has become."}
{"text":"WOW. What a delicious meal! Green Chilli enchiladas the BOMB. The prickly pear margarita was great!

We walked in to be greeted by an energetic hostess who seated us in about 5 minutes ( said the wait was 15-20 mins ) and Zeek the waiter was so friendly and fast with orders/refills. Super good food, I should know because I've been coming here since it opened. One of the better restraunts in the Phoenix area. Hope visit will be as good as ours"}
{"text":"Went here tonight and I absolutely loved it!! My hubby and I shared the Lobster dip and the seafood enchiladas! We also used the free guacamole deal for checking in on here. We picked a good day to try the enchiladas because they were the special of the day so we saved $5. We can both individually eat a lot of food and munching on chips and salsa, guacamole then the lobster dip then our meal... We were plenty stuffed! We also had our 3 1/2 year old with and their kids menu was attached to a kids magnetic drawing board thing she LOVED it!! Way better than crayons and paper! She got a bean and cheese burrito was was huge btw she a and liked it, so I'm eatng it for lunch tomorrow:) defiantly going back to try more!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times but have never reviewed our visits. This mainstay near downtown Mesa smells like mesquite grilled heaven as you enter from the parking lot. The menu has a variety of memorable choices from the ancho-chile grilled salmon to the stacked enchiladas and lobster tamales. The tri-colored chips and salsa are terrific... don't miss the Yelp check in for a free cup of house made guacamole. The beer list is decent as well. Our service was good, not great but good. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our first time here, and man was it good. The food was amazing. But the service. Not so much. Dinner was rushed and the wait time for our bill and dessert was slow. We will come back for the food alone."}
{"text":"If you've never had posole before, this is the place to try but I'm gonna warn you, they set the bar high. Probably better than my grandmother's recipe. Huge portion of meat, complimented by a chile broth and hominy with perfect tenderness. Their salsa is thick and quite tasty. It's not the New Mexico style I'm used to but it was another 10 for taste and quality. 

My main entree was three stacked enchiladas, Christmas style (red and green sauce)...oh crap, I over-ordered. The stacked are very cool -- like a Mexican lasagne.

My waiter was excellent. Great personality and very attentive. This place is popular for a reason. I hope to swing by again in the near future."}
{"text":"Carne Adovada...
that's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Can't wait to come back! Food is great! Cute and cozy! Sangria was good!!"}
{"text":"I was forced to come into town after I heard my sister passed away and after the funeral. our family of 7 went out to eat here. The person working heard about the death of my sister through Facebook and they gave us the entire meal on the house. I had the chorizo stuffed chicken and it was out of the world. The hatch green Chile's tasted like I was in new Mexico. Thank you guys so much. It changed my whole family's attitude and put a smile on our faces."}
{"text":"I love this food but the service is really lacking..  we come here at least once a month but the service is rarely good much less great..  Hey owners do you not read what your customers say??  Help us love this place by stepping up the service...  dont you want to keep loyal customers??  Help us help you..  READ what the customers say and make a difference!!!"}
{"text":"Read about this place on Yelp before we headed out to Mesa for a long weekend. Decided to stop in based on the reviews. Glad we did. Super nice server...she was very fun. Food was awesome. We had the Calamari steak appetizer (not on the menu) on special with a sweet and spicy glaze. I had the spooning rellenos, which were fabulous and VERY filling. House margarita was good. Everyone is right....don't let the outside of the place (not impressive at ALL) stop you from going in. It's quaint, casual and the food was delicious. This will definitely be a regular stop when we're in Arizona."}
