{"text":"TLDR don't go to Mad Noodles if you don't have time or you're too antisocial to entertain the waitstaff. They'll treat you like garbage and talk crap to other patrons while you're sitting right there.  Went in Sunday night with my boyfriend. I am getting over a cold and wanted soup, and we also looked at houses all day and wanted to talk about one we were considering buying. When we walked in, the bartender/waitress/only person in the front of house said we could sit anywhere, then my boyfriend saw some menus on a table and tried to take one. She told us that there were already menus at every table. It was our bad, so we just picked a table. She brought us some water, then didn't come back for another 5-7 minutes (I wasn't timing her, we were talking, but it did get to the point where I was looking around to see where she had gone).  She came back and took our drink order, and kept correcting us on little things we misspoke on, including my boyfriend saying, \"Soup dumplings,\" then her saying, \"pork?\" and him saying yes to pork, then her saying, \"Not pork and crab,\" then me being like, no pork, then her being like, \"It's good to specify that.\" We misspoke, and she corrected us in an overly bossy tone. I'm using bossy to be nice, but it made me feel sassy, so I ordered in a bossy tone to match.  We sat back and kept talking about houses. During the time that we sat there, she came back to ask us if we had ordered an appetizer and say that, \"Your drinks are almost done,\" in the next fifteen minutes. She walked past our table while we were looking at the seller's disclosure for a house and underhandedly said, \"We're real interactive tonight,\" to no one. Then, as the other table was leaving she said, \"Thank you so much, some people can be so rude, especially tonight.\"   At that point we were both pissed, hungry, and certain that she was talking about us, which is not professional or ok. When she came back a SECOND time 20 minutes later to ask us what we had ordered, my boyfriend lost it and told her we were leaving. She asked why, and he exploded (it was horrible but I don't regret it, she was terrible at her job). She walked us out, nodding and disagreeing with us on every point we brought up. Personally I think if she wants to play the cold jerk waitress card she should go back to bartending at some seedy southside bar.   The other people probably felt bad for her and gave her a nice tip it was so explosive. Apparently we walked in with an attitude, but all we walked in to do was eat soup and talk about a house."}
{"text":"Awesome tofu Singapore noodles!!!! Vegetarians- ask server about fish sauce in many of their dishes- very helpful and informative!!!"}
{"text":"The food there are really tasty and the price is very reasonable. I really like their chicken wings and fries, its different from all other restaurants. Their bubble tea are great?definitely gonna go back there again."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here and got the shrimp Pad tau, and there was literally 1 single piece of shrimp in the dish. This is completely unacceptable especially when there is an Upcharge for shrimp. Won't be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"This place has modern decor and amazing food. You can get any kind of Asian fusion food from sushi to pad Thai. I would definitely recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Their bubble tea tasted like watered down milk and the boba were flavorless. Extremely disappointed. The waiter forgot to even take our order so we left, no one was even there."}
{"text":"Damn good food. Thai Fried Rice, Singapore Noodles, and Japanese Ramen with Pork Belly are the tastiest!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   Food - awesome  Staff - awesome (Holly is super nice) Decor - welcoming  Bar -  (they have alcoholic bubble tea)  I judge a place harshly on their soup dumplings, their pho and their pad Thai.   I got the soup dumplings, the Vietnamese egg rolls (they come with 4 I just had to eat one before I took the pic) and the pho. All amazing. The pho was really flavorful (I got the combo minus the tripe).   They make their own hot oil in house which was amazing. My friend added it to her soy sauce and it was too good.   I need to get the pad Thai next time.   If you're looking for a low cost Noodle house and are in south side, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Expensive for low quality food you're getting Ramen was not authentic. Egg was hard boiled to rubberiness, soup was not the japanese broth you're looking for.  Pork sliders had a very strong MSG taste- you can taste the concentrated msg off of each bite you take... yuck."}
{"text":"Man these portions are MAAD big   Came here for lunch and ordered the pork soup dumplings, stir-fry beef with flat rice noodle (spice level 2) and flat rice noodle Thai style with chicken (spice level 3). The spice levels range from 1-5 but levels 2 and 3 were nowhere near spicy, especially level 3. The pork soup dumplings were yummy just like any other pork soup dumplings. The stir fry beef with flat rice noodle was good but I guess the beef was a bit on the salty side. The flat rice noodle Thai style with chicken had more flavor and was like a pad see yew just without bok choy and a soy sauce base. Also did I mention the portion size is huuuge.   I don't think the atmosphere inside is meant for lunch dining - maybe more for an evening because there's more of a bar feel. They also sell alcoholic bubble tea?? Wonder what that'd taste like...   The service wasn't too great. Although we were the only customers being served, the workers just seemed like they didn't care much because it wasn't that busy during the time we were there. But wouldn't that mean they'd give better service because they have more time? Also when we got our checks and cards back to sign the receipts, we weren't given any pens to sign with. So we resorted to using our own from our backpacks. I felt like that was just a lack of care for us customers.   Overall I felt like this was just another Thai restaurant but there are more better Thai restaurants in pittsburgh that I would go to than here."}
{"text":"I would not recommend ordering from here. My standards for delivery are very low being that there are so few places that will deliver to my house. I was craving Thai food so I placed an order for Spicy (level 4) pad Thai, chicken satay and Thai iced bubble tea. I got an email about 10 mins later explaining that my order had been cancelled as Eat Street could not get in touch with the restaurant to put it through. Okay - I was bummed but still starving so I ordered from an Indian restaurant on Grub Hub. So now I'm expecting a delivery but when my food arrived I was like wow this Indian place delivers FAST. It's dark outside, so I took my food in and realized when the light hit it that it was my Thai food order from Mad Noodles instead.. wtf. That's just the delivery aspect of my order.   EatStreet said they would still reimburse me on this order as I was told it was cancelled. Thankfully I didn't pay for this food from Mad Noodles or I would have been pissed. The chicken satay meat was a terrible quality and the peanut sauce was way too thick and sweet. I took a few bites of the pad Thai, same issues with the quality of the chicken meat. The bean sprouts were highly suspect. I picked all kinds of weird morsels out of my food (what looked like weird grey colored puffed rice?? and rotten bean sprouts). The flavor was not impressive to me in any way it was too salty, no sweet heat. Just yuck. I tried the Thai iced tea last and it was nasty how sweet it was. Plus the tapioca bubbles were mushy. I was more than disappointed with this order and any place that delivers to me is already ahead in my book. Just don't do it."}
{"text":"my first experience with this place was delivery, so I decided to give it a shot a second time eating at the restaurant. they only had one person working in the front during dinner time. waited 15-20 minutes just to get my order taken, and another 45 minutes just to get my appetizers. the appetizers are good, ramen is alright, pho is terrible.   the takeaway lesson here is don't dine in; get delivery/take out instead."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go bubble tea and takoyaki balls! Yum! Friendly staff and fast service. Will def try to come back and dine in."}
{"text":"Went on 9/9/17 a Saturday at 12:30, supposed to open at 12. Wasn't open.  Had 2 people with me. Excited to try this place.  Just disappointed.  At at The South Side Deli, was really good and they were open."}
{"text":"Omg - this place is a delight!  I ordered using the UberEats app.    I got the Singapore noodles - with vegetables & tofu -- 3 for spice and it actually has a kick to it.  Rice noodles, lots of vegetables and lots of tofu! So good!!   I also got a large milk bubble tea - really yummy and came sealed which is really cool.    Generous portions for both and reasonably priced.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and bar. We tried this place for the first time on Friday night (half off appetizers). The Singapore Noodles is a favorite. We also tried the pho and ramen noodles which were also very good! The portions are pretty big. My daughter loves loves loves the bubble tea (try the Taro). They need a bigger dessert menu but do have a good selection of bubble teas (if you don't like the bubbles you can ask for the drinks without them). Finally, we had a server (Holly) who was incredibly helpful and nice! Great service and we'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We order food for delivery, because we wanted something yummy and quicker.  I would have to say it will take some time before we order from here again. The food took 20 minutes longer than quoted.   The food was alright but it was luke warm and kind of bland. We ordered pad Thai which my boyfriend liked pretty well. It wasn't the best Pad Thai he has ever had. It was a little bland and not warm. My curry shrimp was not good at all. It was not warm and there was not a lot of shrimp in it.   The reviews were so good but we didn't have a good experience at all. we may try it again another time but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I ordered from Mad Noodles last night via Uber Eats. I only mention Uber Eats because I am going to attribute the temperature of my food on arrival to Uber Eats, despite the fact that the driver appeared to take an efficient route to my apartment.  I was actually craving Pho Van, but they are not available on Uber Eats and I have found Postmates to be worse in service, and far more expensive. So I searched for pho in Uber Eats and Mad Noodles popped up. I quick Yelp peak indicated middling reviews, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.  Looking at their menu I allowed the self-deception to take hold and got excited. Pho and soup dumplings on one menu? Having that.  I should have known better. These trendy pan-asian \"noodle\" places don't tend to be good at anything in particular. I believe I have even reviewed Lulu's Noodles in the past which should have served as my reminder to avoid this type of place in the future.  My food arrived, and as hinted above, the temperature was not where I hoped it would be. The broth was warm, but not hot, and the soup dumplings were room temperature.  I dug into a soup dumpling first. I was rewarded with a large, boring pork meatball and a small amount of soup that was already re-congealing. The taste was almost more sweet than savory, which still doesn't make sense to me at all.  Next, I started to prepare my pho. The pho arrives with the broth in one large plastic container, and the noodles and beef in another. The garnishes arrive in a small styrofoam container, and included a generous heap of bean sprouts, a few stems of cilantro, sliced jalapeño pepper, a lime wedge and a single basil leaf. I can't recall if white onions were included, or just present in the broth (which also contained jalapeño pepper slices). Neither Sriracha nor Hoisin was provided, but fortunately I keep those at home.  The first disappointment came in terms of the beef. I am accustomed to Pho Van's pho tai, which is recognizable as thin slices of rare eye of round. By comparison Mad Noodle's beef, while probably also eye of round, seems to have undergone the same process that a Subway restaurant subjects meat to to turn it into the tough, gray tragedy that it is.  The next horror, and I use this word literally, was the sharp chemical smell that hit me upon opening the garnish container. Despite a similar garnish set up, Pho Van's has never smelled this unnatural. I proceeded with caution by isolating each ingredient and smelling and tasting each. Nothing seemed too offensive, though the cilantro was a bit soapy smelling, which is normally not something I experience with cilantro, though I'm told that it is fairly common.  I added the noodles, beef and garnishes to my bowl, and poured the broth over it. There was no steam from the broth. I gently mixed it together, as the portions are quite large and filled my bowl to the brim. I took my first bite and found the broth to be utterly flavorless (save for, again, the inexplicable sensation of sweetness). I always taste the broth before modifying the flavor with things like lime, hoisin or Sriracha. For comparison, I find Pho Van's broth to be generally quite tasty, though I do tend to add some Sriracha to punch up the spice a bit, and a bit of hoisin to give it a faint twinkle of sweetness.  All in all, my experience with Mad Noodles was exactly what I should have expected (come to think of it, I think I complained about too much sweetness in my review of Lulu's as well). There honestly wasn't anything about that meal that I would want to experience again, and recall that I'm not even blaming them for the cold temperature of my food.  If you are in the mood for soup dumplings, you have to go to Squirrel Hill and eat at Everyday Noodles. That's it. We can all keep hoping for a legitimate competitor to appear, but it will take some doing.  If you are seeking pho, check out Pho Van in the Strip or Tram's Kitchen in Bloomfield.  If you are seeking Thai or ramen, options abound.  Whatever you decide, please don't deceive yourself: you cannot have it all in one place."}
{"text":"I had better expectations of this place. I'm pretty disappointed. Everything looked good but it was not as tasty as it looked. I ordered the Japanese ramen and pork buns. The buns were good but a bit tasteless. I enjoyed the soy sauce concoction that came with it, though.   The ramen was also tasteless. There was about zero salt in it. The egg was hard boiled with a hard yoke, not soft like it should be. The pork belly was tough and didn't taste that good. I didn't like that they put seaweed in it, either, it was overpowering since the broth wasn't good. The only thing I really liked was the bok choy and noodles.  Maybe their Thai would be better?"}
{"text":"If you're craving noodles (and I ALWAYS am!) this is the perfect spot to satisfy all your cravings!  This spot offers a little bit of everything, but not too much! I tend to steer clear of places that try to cater to various Asian dishes from various countries, but I have to say, they were spot on with their flavors and presentation, while keeping the dishes authentic or very close to authentic. Being Southeast Asian myself, I can be ultra picky with SE Asian dishes and I was very satisfied with the foods they had available and the flavors!  I ordered Thai Basil Chicken and my husband ordered Japanese Ramen and we shared soup dumplings. They all tasted great (especially my chicken!). I will definitely be coming to this spot again.  My husband also ordered an alcohol bubble tea and said loved it. (He's picky about his bubble tea, so I trusted that it tasted good)  The service was a little slow but she was very good otherwise. Our soup dumplings did come out a little late, which could be worked on, but I personally did not complain because I just had them with my meal, no big deal."}
{"text":"Craveworthy and can't wait to come back!  I remember when this place was the City Grill.  I don't remember what it turned into after because I never went but thought the new name was clever and had to check it out and it did not disappoint!  The bartender, (who was also our server), Holly, was a doll - we loved her! Super friendly and always checked on us - really great!  As for the food,  first of all, I'm obsessed with pork belly so as soon as we saw pork belly 'sliders' as an app it was a done deal.   Perfection!  For our lunches, we got the ramen (with pork belly) :-) and also the Singapore noodles.  The ramen broth was like a miso - so flavorful and delicious.  The Singapore noodles were out of control delicious.  Will be back for more Singapore noodles for sure and will try other dishes."}
{"text":"It's okay. Beef Pho is good - although I wasn't blown away by it. Sushi isn't recommendable. The salmon tasted not too fresh. White tuna was okay."}
{"text":"I must agree with Kimberly on the Pho. It lacked taste but the presentation was nice..The spring rolls were excellent and they also had a nice presentation. Portions were hearty.  I used a Groupon . The atmosphere was quiet and the art displayed had some interesting pieces."}
{"text":"We were having a couple of staycation drinks nearby this past weekend when I decided to search out somewhere to grab a bite.  I noticed Mad Noodle was new and the idea of a big fat noodle carb filled spicy dinner delight was just the perfect follow-up to my frosty brew.  We walked in and settled down at the bar by the door.  I notice the small chalkboard on the bar advertising a happy hour from 5-7 every day.  You can get  1/2 off select apps.  Unfortunately the app I was interested was not included in the happy hour price, however that didn't deter me from ordering their steamed Asian Pork Buns, 6 come in an order for 8.95.  For my entrée I knew I wanted some noodles and with some helpful suggestions from our server/bartender I went with the *Singapore Noodles with shrimp on a heat level of 4 out of 5.  The heat here is not as extreme as in other Asian restaurants in the city so if you aren't afraid of a little spice 4 is a safe bet.    Our buns were delivered and they were very good.  I could have probably eaten a dozen and I'm not kidding.  They were light and airy with a decent amount of filling.  This was a great start to our early dinner.  My entrée was brought out shortly after our apps and it was steaming hot and fresh.  The spice level was perfect for me where it had a nice kick but I could still taste everything and it wasn't overpowering.  I couldn't finish it or I would have been in a carb coma but man those leftovers were great.  Even though I felt like I was on an episode of Miami Vice, seriously what's with the neon blue and pink lights?  It was a very good dining experience both food and service."}
{"text":"Food is VERY good! Singapore noodles are a favorite - but they have a habit of getting orders for delivery & takeout wrong.. so check your order!"}
{"text":"Food was ok very generic. With all of the other much better choices in town I won't be trying this again."}
{"text":"I really hate writing bad reviews since I'm pretty easy please. However, the ramen I had here was absolutely tasteless. The broth was bland, the egg was completely runny, and the pork was unseasoned. I've never had ramen that bad before. I emptied half a bottle of Shichimi just to give it some taste. The price definitely didn't match up to what I was served. Maybe they had an off day but Mad Noodles is a place I wouldn't recommend.   The service was great however."}
{"text":"They're gonna be spicier than ya think. Which is good for a lot of people!  I'm a huge wuss when it comes to spice. I could handle 2, but kinda wish I woulda gone 1.   Service was fast, and the place was empty, which is sorta a shame but it made for a great place to talk with a large group."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Everyone that works here seems extremely friendly and wants to make your experience here as positive as possible. We asked for 2 sides of extra sauces (made in house) and were given large portions free of charge. The ramen was flavorful and came quick. The appetizers were hot and quick. Great specials too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, had the Pad Thai w/tofu and veggie fried rice w/tofu.  The food was excellent and the service was friendly and attentive.  Portions were large enough to take the extras home for dinner.  REALLY delicious!"}
{"text":"We like their appetizers and the space is nice. We don't go as much for dinner, as their menu lacks sufficient options. Basically, cannot eat beef and don't like duck. That eliminates the majority of the entrees for us. You would think a place that has several types of noodle soups could have some great chicken noodle soup. Nope, they do not serve any. Again great apps, and some good BEEF noodles but the majority of the noodle menu is offlimits to those that dont eat beef; dont bring a vegetarian here, they'll only have a few thai entrees to choose from and little else. Wish they had chicken and vegetable options, would eat there much more."}
{"text":"I've been trying pho places all over town to see which is my favorite, and I found this place. It's nice and close so I was hoping it would be good. Unfortunately, though the staff is nice their food is not so nice. I ordered a beef pho (they have tripe, meatball, and a combo option), spring rolls, and Thai tea with boba.  Got the Thai tea, and I immediately disliked it. Poor flavor and bad boba. It would seem as if the people are not trained to make it properly. The waitress made it, and she gave it to me and explained that she just kind of figures it out. She did not cook the tapioca balls enough so they were hard and clumped together. The spring rolls were not spring rolls. They were egg rolls but with a friend rice paper wrapper instead of the usual wrapper. They were the best part of the meal even if they were not what I wanted. The pho was quite awful. I always finish my food, but I lost my appetite halfway through. It had no flavor at all. The chef must have been scared of salt. I added hoisin and Sriracha in hopes I'd get more flavor. It didn't work. When I told the waitress she said perhaps it was because I'd asked for no jalapeno. Not the reason, and the 2 jalapeno slices in my friends soup wouldn't have done anything either. She brought out salt and some Thai peanut sauce for me to put in my soup. Not only is it ridiculous that I had to try to season my soup myself (without success), but she also seemed to think that it would do the trick. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered roasted duck over rice and a pork Japanese ramen. Duck is okay, but rice is kinda dry. Pretty hard to swallow it. And the ramen soup is just so so."}
{"text":"great food?love the eel sushi here, so delicious! I recommend the dumplings, beef noodle with sour vegetables, and pho combination!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch today with my fiance, and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was! We were greeted by the bartender immediately, and she couldn't have been a nicer person. We had a nice conversation with her from the beginning of our meal to the end, and she was very helpful.   We decided to split the Pork Soup Dumplings (order of 8) as an appetizer. I haven't found a place other than Everyday Noodles in Pittsburgh that really knocks these out of the park, but Mad Noodles were the best I've had in the city!   We then split an order of the Singapore Noodles (Spice level 2 of 5) which came with shrimp, tofu, beef and chicken! It was really nice to have the variety of meats included. The bartender was proactive and brought us over 3 different dipping sauces (A teriyaki type sauce, duck sauce, and chipotle mayo). I'm defintiely excited to go back and try the Japanese Ramen, flat rice noodles, and pineapple fried rice!"}
{"text":"Food was awful. My husband and I got the beef Pho. There was no flavor, beef was covered in fat and the veggies were covered in mold. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"There were a few things that caught my eye about this place - the name, the bright orange exterior and the futuristic interior all pulled me in. I love asian food and was eager to try another noodle joint out! However, I can't say that this is my favorite noodle joint in Pittsburgh and this is why.   While many items on the menu caught my eye (i.e. duck/pork belly sliders, pineapple fried rice and the thai basil chicken), I had to get the thai style flat noodle with shrimp. It's a noodle place and it only made sense to try something that resides in the name of the restaurant, right? Thai dishes are typically spicy on their own, but you can add some extra kick with their spice level of 1-5. I wanted to give mine a spice level of 2, but our waitress said she would just bring out extra sauce if it wasn't spicy enough for me. When my dish came out, I was very satisfied with the amount of noodles and the size of the shrimp, but once I took my first bite I became let down. The noodles were very doughy/overcooked and the dish was not spicy. Our waitress brought out a mixture of chili paste/sriracha to turn up the heat and it did help! I also ordered a mango smoothie bubble tea and this was probably the best bubble tea I have had in Pittsburgh.   Although the noodles left me disappointed, I will still be back to try the pork belly/duck sliders and pineapple fried rice!"}
{"text":"If someone knows of a better sushi lunch deal in Pittsburgh, please let me know.   $10 for 5 pieces of nigiri, a 6pc California roll, soup and salad.   Normally prices this low would make me suspicious of the quality, but I've been visiting multiple times a week some time now and I've never had an issue.   I normally order take-out, but it's certainly worth dining in just to check out the design and local art.   **If you're a Gluten Free type, they'll swap the Cali roll for a tuna roll without the \"we said no substitutions\" type attitude.  Pro-tip: if you're ordering take-out and live near South Side or plan to pick-up your order, call first. There's free delivery if you're within range of the restaurant and you'll save them from paying commissions of delivery services."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place and when I had a craving for soup I figured this would be a good option. I ordered the Pork Soup dumplings and Japanese Ramen. The dumplings were perfect, I would absolutely order them again. As far as the Japanese Ramen, I got it with the beef meatball and wasn't crazy about the beef quality in it. Other than that, it was flavorful and the noodles in it were good. I probably wouldn't order that again, but I might just be picky with beef. I'm excited to return and try some more dishes though."}
{"text":"Didn't expect it but they had great food! I came here during a weekday during dinner. I didn't realize that they had happy hour which was until 7:00 PM for half off appetizers and specials on drinks. Definitely recommend the pork belly sliders, ramen and the Singapore rice noodles.   We started with the calamari and pork belly sliders as appetizers, honeydew bubble tea and a draft beer for drinks. The bubble tea was too powdery and way too sweet. Do not get the bubble tea! The calamari was mediocre as the quantity was small and the calamari was mostly breading (but it was part of the happy hour special).  The pork sliders were AMAZING!! it had a touch of cilantro which blended well with the flavors. I also really enjoyed the Singapore rice noodles which was huge! It had the right amount of spices and it definitely did not disappoint. The ramen was also really good as it had a good quantity of meat and the broth was delicious! The waiter had forgotten my drink and apologized numerous times which was nice of him. The service could be improved but they were definitely friendly. I will definitely be returning to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Visiting from New York City, really wanted some good Asian food. This place has high quality noodle and sushi! Very comfortable dinning atmosphere. The staff were welcoming and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Singapore noodles are incredible! Service was awesome, good menu selection, great happy hours deals. They even have alcoholic bubble tea. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I wish I had known about this sooner! The noodle scene in Pittsburgh is picking up and it seems like there is a new place every month. Some of them have been izakaya-like places that serve Japanese ramen plus small tapa-like eats, and then there's also the Thai noodle place in Squirrel Hill. This particular place is interesting because although it is Chinese-run, their noodles and small bites are all over the place--pad thai and street noodles, ramen, pho, Singapore noodle, Lanzhou ramen, and more.   Given all that selection, we were only able to try the Singapore rice noodle and Thai wide noodle this time, and both were fantastic, the former probably being one of the best of its kind in the city. While stir-fried noodles are pretty easy to come by in many Asian places, it is often easy to screw it up, whether by being too soggy or too dry, or with stale ingredients. Both of these dishes hit the sweet spot with just enough sauce and fresh ingredients, and the noodles having absorbed all the flavor that comes with being cooked in a wok over a large fire. The prices are very reasonable as well; most dishes are around $10-12, while I've seen some of the places mentioned above easily go to $15 or more for a noodle soup.  The rest of the menu also had some more mainland Chinese appetizers and tapas like XLB and beef roll pancakes, which I'd be interested to try during a future visit (again, I haven't seen many of these elsewhere in Pittsburgh). The ambiance fits well for being a Southside joint, and in addition to having a bar they also serve boba. I even saw a sign advertising alcoholic boba--not sure how that'd be like, but sure is creative! Service was great as well. We came in 15 minutes to closing time, but our waitress was more than happy to accomodate us and give us recommendations."}
{"text":"Really love this place, got takeout twice and the food was excellent and a good price! Would recommend the soup dumplings, pad Thai, and Singapore noodles! Big portions as well!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mad Noodles twice over the last two weeks. The first time was for takeout, and the service was friendly and timely. I got a bubble tea (excellent, no issues there) while my boyfriend ordered the flat noodles with chicken. Normally he's not a picky eater, but he commented that the noodles were all spice and no flavor - I tried them and had to agree.   My second experience was a quick early dinner with a friend. Our waitress was enthusiastic, friendly and was happy to make recommendations. We started with the crab rangoons - they were tasty, but par for the course on such a simple appetizer. My friend ordered the Pad Thai - she was very happy with it, and the portion was so large that she had plenty to take home. I ordered the Japanese Ramen with pork belly and WOW - I can't rave about it enough. The broth was flavorful, not too salty, the pork belly plentiful and delicious: the bowl was huge and left me more than satisfied. I will definitely be returning!  Update: I've been back several times, ordered (too much) takeout, and this place is truly a gem. I can't rave enough, so I had to give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with a group of five. Sampled the Singapore noodles, pad Thai, flat noodles, fried rice, and steamed dumplings. Everything was delicious. Service was quick, server was friendly and helpful, and portions were generous.   You can adjust the heat/spiciness on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being the mildest and 5 the hottest. Usually restaurants err on the side of caution with the heat ratings, but our \"3\" entrees carried quite a kick, and even the \"2\" entrees had more heat than we expected. We could handle the heat, but that's definitely something to keep in mind while ordering.   We were all very pleased with Mad Noodles and look forward to eating there again soon."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai/sushi restaurant we have ever been too!! Excellent food and outstanding service. We will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"AWFUL. I really wanted ramen so we gambled even though others have given it poor reviews. It was practically inedible. I have suspicions that the meat was not, in fact, beef. There was a hard bone or something in the pork soup dumplings. The pork belly sliders were dry and contained what I would compare to a thin slice of deli ham. The quality was so sketchy that I even felt weird about drinking the bubble tea."}
{"text":"Well the inside is nice. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel special.  OK so the bubble tea... I have had bubble tea in several countries and states and cities. Several hundred bubble teas....this was so bad that the next to wist was good compared to this. I don't variate much so I get a Taro milk trea with bulba. The taro/milk was sour and the bulba was clumped together.... did not bother to stay for food"}
{"text":"Two words people: soup dumplings. Goodness! Who doesn't love a good soup dumpling? I never want to meet that shame of existence! I went to Mad Noodles a few weeks ago and ordered the soup dumplings, pork belly buns and Singapore Noodles. Everything was delicious! The buns were delicate and yummy! The pork belly was tender and the spice levels were on point! Our waitress was pretty cool, maybe not the best at waiting tables but we were the only people there..I too would be on my iphone super bored....so no judgment. I don't know why this place was empty! It was so good! I feel like the Southside has a bunch of Asian restaurants that are just sort of ok and this one shines! I definitely will going back!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, but delivery order was kind of wrong. I ordered the pineapple fried rice, but there was  absolutely not a single pineapple ! I was disappointed, and it's extra compared to the Thai fried rice that you can also get with shrimp. It was most likely a mistake, since I ordered the pineapple fried rice ... I was really looked forward to the pineapple. That was pretty disappointing. At least the rice was tasty so I wasn't too upset. Delivery was quick and professional. which was great. Took about 30 minutes and the food was hot. Hopefully if you order this rice you'll get some pineapple in yours!"}
{"text":"I was super excited when I saw a new chinese/asian restaurant opened up on yelp. Looking at the menu they had a lot of dishes that caught my eye. I ended up going with the dumplings and singapore noodles since I never had them before. The dumplings were absolutely amazing but sadly the noodle dish was not. This particular dish comes with all of the meats in it and the meat seemed a bit questionable in my opinion. The beef was extremely chewy and the chicken didn't look right. One thing that I was very impressed with was their bubble tea menu. Most places don't have quite that many options and flavors. I would probably go back just to get their bubble teas to go."}
{"text":"This place shouldn't even get one star for their customer service and their food. First time ordering I ordered Pad Thai with chicken it was less than mediocre. Second time a friend wanted to try it I wasn't thrilled but went along and ordered through UberEATS. Ordered  2 Pad Thai... Got the wrong dish, something with brown sauce, beef, chicken, and shrimp. My friend didn't even get hers. Tried calling the restaurant multiple times because clearly I had someone else's order, and missing one. The restaurant would not pick up the phone. Thankfully UberEATS credited my account but I wouldn't waste my time again for poor customer service and less than mediocre food."}
{"text":"SO HAPPY!!! This place used to be M&J bistro, but has done a complete 180 and I'm thrilled!   My s.o. and I had an unused Groupon for the old place and were reluctant to try it under the new name/concept.  We dragged ourselves here on a Wednesday and got to business.  We ordered the Thai fried rice, Singapore noodle and Japanese Ramen. All were so delicious and so flavorful. We got the rice with mixed meat, spice level 4.  Singapore (level 4) is 10x better than across the street. Ramen was so good and some of the better we've had in town.  We just got back from Japan and this will be our new spot for ramen for sure!  Spice game is strong and we love it!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at this restaurant yesterday. We had. He led out their menu that they had taped to their window. We love Pho so we headed in. The server was a very nice young lady who did a great job of answering our questions. She was very knowledgeable about the food. She was great the whole time we were there. She was very attentive.  I ordered the Pho with beef meatballs. (You could also get beef tripe or regular beef). My hubby got Flat Noodles with shrimp. You could get 1-5 Heat choice. He went with 3.  My soup came and it was HUGE. You definitely weren't going to leave hungry. The broth, meatballs, and rice noodles were in the huge bowl. You were given a small square plate with a wedge of lime, fresh basil, bean sprouts, jalapeños, and fresh cilantro. I dumped it all in except the jalapeños. I took a few bites and I was disappointed.  The broth had zero flavor. The meatballs had a very weird texture. I'm weird about textures so it was off putting. It was grainy with bits that were gelatinous. I hardly ate any. I regretted not getting regular beef. I ate most of the noodles. I got the rest to go hoping that the basil and other side items would instill some flavor into the broth. I would not be eating the meatballs but maybe someone in our household would.  I tried my husband's Flat Noodles with shrimp. It was very good. A bit too spicy for me, but very flavorful.  I wouldn't rush to go back but I would go again to have the Flat Noodles or try the Street Noodles."}
{"text":"I have walked past this place multiple times but never stopped in but I was craving pad tai so I decided to give it a go.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly we had nice conversation while I was waiting for my food to be ready I also ordered a pineapple beer in the meantime and it was really good. I ordered pad tai , pork belly buns and honey dew bubble  milk tea. The pad tai was really good they put a good bit of peanuts in it which I like,  the pork belly buns were OK not my favorite but the bubble tea was so good it was probably the best I've ever had the tapicoa was perfect it wasn't extremely chewy it was just right. I would definitely come back even if it's just to order the bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was very empty, but service was terrible. The one waiter sat at the bar and ate with friends instead of checking on us. We sat directly in front of the bar. Our soup dumplings came after we had already finished eating and had no soup in them. When the waiter tried to take them off the bill she couldn't figure it out and instead of finding her manager just hung around the bar and talked to her friends. Pork sliders were good, but the ramen and curry soup (which wasn't soup at all) weren't great."}
{"text":"Ordered thru UberEATS, and though that service is a separate issue & one that I will never be using again, Mad Noodles dropped the ball on their own. I ordered the Crab Rangoon, Pork Soup Dumplings, Thai Flat Noodles, and a sprite. They forgot the soup dumplings completely, and due to the trainwreck known as UberEATS,  I never got them. The sprite was soda water, I guess the box was out and no one knew. The Thai noodles were flavorless, over cooked, and greasy- so gross. The crab Rangoon was good. Will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Would not recommend. They would not make my food how I wanted it. Weird atmosphere. Feels like you're in a strip club. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Some menu items are quite good and others are not.  The Ramen is good.  But I had the braised beef and the beef wasn't really the meat part, it was made up of cartilage and some other left over parts that I couldn't identify.  Whatever it was I couldn't chew it and had to toss most of the meat away.  I was a bit grossed out by it.  But many other dishes are good.  My suggestion is to go online and see what other people liked before ordering."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Fairmont hotel and ordered takeout from here using GrubHub. I ordered pho and a ginger ale. Food was as expected. Nothing special. I appreciate they delivered to my hotel. The delivery included hoisin sauce and sriracha, which I appreciated. The noodles and the broth were in separate containers, which ensured the noodles didn't get overcooked."}
{"text":"This is the second time that we have been to Mad Noodles.  The first time was about 9 months ago.  We have been in a real noodle kick and we were hungry for it this past weekend.  It actually was on Easter Sunday and they were open so we stopped by.       Both times we came here we sat at the bar.  It has funky lights in there but it isn't distracting.  Customer service has been great each visit too.  We were watching the Pirates game this time on Easter Sunday.  We started off with their Steamed Pork Buns.  5 out of 5.  They were so good both times.  Steamed perfectly and there was a lot of good meat in them too.  These buns are one of the best we have tasted in the Burgh.  Our next course we ordered the Duck Slider.  It came with two sliders and we shared them.  There weren't as good as the buns but they were still good.  4 out of 5 for the slider.       The first time we came here I ordered the Sesame Chicken.  I though they were really good but this time I wanted wide noodles.  We were full by this time so we ordered our noodle dishes to go.  My wife ordered the Singapore Noodles with shrimp and I got the same thing but with chicken.  We both ate this at home and I really liked my noodles.  I thought they were perfect.  My wife liked hers too but she felt she didn't get enough shrimp.         Overall Mad Noodles has us Mad Nuts on Noodles and Buns.  We don't go to the South Side too often but this is now our go to place when were in the South Side."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and food was excellent. The pad Thai was delicious, $12 and very generous portion. Will definitely be coming here over Nicki's Thai Kitchen."}
{"text":"Oh Yelp, you fooled me again. Mr. J and I had been wanting to try this place for a while and based on the reviews, it seemed like a sure bet. Wrong.  First off, service was incredibly slow. Our server was super friendly, but the kitchen was incredibly slow. We waited 10 minutes for what was disappointing bubble tea. Mr. J ordered a black milk tea and it tasted like it was made from a mix. I had the mango and there wasn't a drop of tea in it. It was just a sugary mango juice with tapioca pearls.  When our meals came out, there were a few other glaring issues: - sweet dumpling sauce served with the soup dumplings. These are traditionally served with black vinegar and shredded ginger, by the way. - the eggs in the ramen were overcooked and the yolks were a powdery gloop. - the ramen noodles were overcooked and mushy. - the beef tendon was undercooked and rubbery. This place is terribly overpriced for the quality of food. Go next door to The Comubian Place for a good meal."}
{"text":"I can't remember the first time I ate here, but it has only been around a few years, so it can't have been too long. At this point, I would be sad if it wasn't in the neighborhood.   I have gone there with coworkers for lunch, birthday friends for a super casual dinner, both takeout and delivery and it has always been good for me. The prices are decent and the portions are large enough to share. I consider them my easy \"comfort\" noodle place.   I initially went for their soup dumplings, but almost always find myself currently ordering their Singapore noodles with everything or their flat rice noodle dishes. I don't think you can go wrong with either.   It's really easy to go wrong with Singapore noodles if it isn't served fresh, so I appreciate their efforts. The different appetizers are very good too.  I want to eventually branch out and try their house oxtail soup or eel over rice, but I can't seem to get past my crave worthy favorites."}
{"text":"My visit was totally random and not based on any recommendations or reviews. I happened to be on the street, was hungry, and saw the Mad Noodles sign and thought to myself, \"Noodles sound good.\" I stepped inside and was greeted with a very club/lounge look that is not at all what the outside leads one to expect. I sat down at the bar, ordered a beer, and started checking out the menu. The first good sign was craft beer on draft. There was a nice selection of noodle soups and dry noodles and I was feeling like a soup since it was cold outside. Duck always makes my mouth water and the Shredded Roasted Duck Rice Noodle Soup sounded perfect. As I waited for my order, the server brought over a sushi roll and said they were giving free sushi to anyone who sat at the bar that night. What a nice surprise! Shortly after that, my soup arrived and it was a massive bowl. The sushi was okay but far from anything considered to be great sushi. The soup was better but still seemed to be lacking something. It was a bit bland.   I could see myself stopping in again if I lived nearby but I doubt it would ever be a destination. The service was pleasant and the food arrived in good time. It was okay and there were no glaring negatives, it just did not wow me."}
{"text":"I came in during lunch. There was only one waitress, and she was too busy trying to flirt with the two guys in front. Blond hair curly, if you see her. RUN! She is a terrible waitress. Then gave me attitude when I  asked if she could take our order. We were sitting there for close to 8-9 minutes.    The pho was terrible. NO FLAVOR, what so ever! It tasted like beef broth watered down. TERRIBLE SERVICE, awful pho! what a waste of time.    I also had the chicken satay. Same thing, no flavor, just honey  on top with a peanut sauce.  Um ok. no thank you."}
{"text":"If you like chewy mystery meats stop down to mad noodles. Not even sure if this is beef. It actually tastes worse than it looks if you can believe that. Absolutely foul... not even my dog will eat it. I would like my money back."}
