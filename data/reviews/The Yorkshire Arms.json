{"text":"TL;DR: good quiet place, usually not too busy. Food is good, try the BBQ chicken wrap. Upgrade to Greek salad is $2.50.... Money grab :( . Feels understaffed, a.k.a. waitress doesn't continuously check for things you may need. WiFi locked, no sign of password written down or offering of free WiFi. 


Yorkshire arms is a great place to go if you are looking for a quiet place to hang out with some friends and get a few drinks. Normally, I am part of the largest and loudest group there.

Their selection of food is definitely more orientated towards the drunken bar crowd, but if you are looking for a decent meal I have almost always had good experiences with it. I have religiously ordered either the BBQ chicken wrap or the bangers and mash entree. It is nice that they have delicious healthy alternatives too such as salad, However, to upgrade from garden salad to Greek salad costs you 2.50 which feels kind of like a money grab... 2.50 to add 2 slices of tomatoes, maybe 2 olives, some feta cheese and a different dressing?!?!?! -1 star...

The biggest problem is that they have locked WiFi, so for a shy person like me, I did not ask them for the password since I felt like they were always very busy. I did not feel like I had the chance to ask for it. It would be nice if they posted the password somewhere in the store such as the menu. -1 star"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and a much better value vs The irish pub down the road, great British pub atmosphere ideal for groups but what sets it apart is the service. Glen is a star!!"}

{"text":"Came here for the first time with a group of 10, for the tragically hip last concert showing. 

There is no a/c. We asked the waitress. It was hot as hell in here.

Aside from that the food was good. We got the platter for $26.99. Was actually a good amount of food and tasty.

The drinks were made really well and the staff were friendly and on point.

Only reason for the star loss is the a/c. With so many people in the building investing in fans or a/c would be a good idea."}
{"text":"This a pretty nice British pub in Sauga, the bartender/owner has an fantastic English accent, very friendly and welcoming customer service, great comfortable seating ( I love couches ) that got some good ones, I think they have a fire place too. Patio is also nice in the summer time

I have not tried their food, maybe I'll stop by soon and update

Keep on yelping"}
{"text":"This review is purely based on todays horrible walk in experience. Came in to see one waitress at the bar working. I smiled at her as I normally would expecting for her to atleast say hi. Instead, she looked at me in straight in the eyes FOUR times and did not bother to greet us. She went on to serve the four other men at the bar and let us stand there for another 15 minutes. I'd understand if it were busy however, it was not. It was obvious she would rather drink and chit chat to get her tips, then to service to a family. After standing there being as polite as possible, we decided to walk out. Maybe this place wasn't a great idea for young ones, but the least she could do was her job! I've been so excited to try this place out, and thought for sure based on the reviews I'd enjoy it. Im sad I couldn't give the food a try, I am hopeful it's better than the horrific service though!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Quiet. Slow service. Terrible nachos. The place is more for the drinks then the food."}
{"text":"Horrible! The worst bar in Mississauga! Owner is a rude fucking clown! Staff is drunk, food is shit bar is sketchy just stay away! BAD BAD BAD BAD. Better bars down the street."}
{"text":"So this is the second time I ordered chilli. And again it was tooooo salty. The first time I returned it after taking a bite. Last night I just had a little of it and left the rest. Never order chilli there.
Also I hear a new owner has taken over. I strongly suggest they improve the quality of food. It is really bad. Even the club sandwich I ordered was just blahh
The staff was good though. They usually are. The new bartender was very sweet. I forget her name"}
