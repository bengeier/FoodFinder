{"text":"I live a few blocks from this restaurant so I decided to try it on a Thursday after work. Walking by they always have a busy crowd so I had high expectations. I ordered the calamari and cocktail at the bar. It was average. I wasn't impressed with my overall experience and won't likely return."}
{"text":"Was visiting town for business and chose this little hot new spot for dinner. Upscale cool atmosphere with a cute outdoor patio.  Nice menus that is not too pricey. Tilapia was delicious and the gnocchi were really great. Petite filet very good and nice size or the price!  I didn't make it, but they have a GREAT happy hour!! Really enjoyed my evening and dinner at Sausalito on Ninth.  A great place for a date. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place was promising. Was small but the items on the menu looked yummy. Our waiter was very engaging but it was obvious that the restaurant was understaffed.  A private party was taking place inside and outside there were 8 tables filled with patrons. Serving the customers outside and the private party  was 1 bartender and 1 waiter. We left after 1 drink. They never came back to ask if we wanted any food. The bill took forever to get. Such a shame."}
{"text":"The other reviews for this restaurant looked fake to me or written by an employee, so I wasn't sure what to expect when I came in.  I had a coupon for 10% off the entree, so I decided to just go check it out. I came in around 8pm and it wasn't that busy. The bartender Christina told me that this location just opened, so I think that's why. She was very nice and friendly! There was a guy at the bar who I thought was being a little arrogant, but she handled it very well without getting annoyed. I ordered a margarita and 'Airmail' to drink & enjoyed both. They have a lot of signature cocktails and I was tempted to try all of them. The food is great, I would've gave 5 stars but for the price I think the portions could be bigger. I had the rosemary chicken w/ mushroom cream sauce but I'm picky and asked them to take the mushrooms out, and they did with no problem. I loved how the chicken was cooked, it has a char grilled taste which added great flavor. I also tried a little of the truffle Mac & cheese. The owner came down to the bar and asked the customers how we liked everything, you can tell he really takes pride in his business."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch before visiting the rock and roll hall of fame. Beautiful day, lunch outside was delicious. Enjoyed my rose wine and my husband loved the beer selection. Our server Charlie was fun and helped us understand tomorrow's marathon route. Stop in while you're in Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"My visit to Cleveland this week ended with a wonderful lunch at Sausalito.   Recommended by a local colleague, we arrived a little before noon, so we were seated right away.  Our server was great, and he and others who waited on us were very attentive.  I ordered from a list of specials for the week.   I went with the salmon with crab and eggplant napoleon with lemon butter sauce.  It was excellent, perfectly proportioned, and the crab and eggplant were two layers of each, alternately stacked.  The eggplant was lightly breaded and lightly fried, and the crab cakes were thin enough to be effective yet not overpower the dish.  The salmon was cooked medium, flaky and tender, and delicious.   The lemon butter sauce had very good flavor, but was obviously done with salted butter. The dish was $18 and did not come with a starch, but I didn't  miss having one.  My only regret is that I didn't get a pic to share with you!"}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday party with a pretty large group (16 people). Waitress was not able to handle that size of a group. It took forever to get drinks and the food was average at best... definitely does not look as appetizing in person as compared to the original photos posted on yelp. Also, one person did not get their food. When it came to checks that's was a mess.   Though they have the space, I would not recommend for large groups. However, the cocktails were good and i could maybe see this place as a good spot for happy hour as long as you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"We had a team luncheon at the new Sausalito location on East 9th street. We made a reservation because we had 13 people in our group. The server was waiting for us when the host seated us. She took our drink orders and was prompt and courteous.   I ordered the veggie sandwich, which was served on a pretzel bun. Our food came out a while later, albeit, not at the same time. From start to finish it took almost 10 minutes to get all of our food delivered. My veggie sandwich was really tasty, especially the pretzel bun, which I could've eaten alone. I had a cup of tomato bisque, which was craveable. I couldn't identify the vegetables on my sandwich other than the delicious mushrooms. However, the sandwich was very tasty and I would order it again.  Loved it! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service from Lizzie and tasty food. Can't believe these scrumptious pulled pork tacos and mushroom flatbread (both large enough to be meals) are each $5 happy hour apps. Coupled with outside dining and music being played on street makes this a fantastic stop on my biz travels.  If nearby, it's definitely worth it!!!"}
{"text":"We went here to get a drink and some food before an event we were going to downtown. The bartender was very friendly and very attentive. The place was decorated very nicely and I liked how open it was. I ordered a Tom Collins and my boyfriend had a Moscow mule. Neither one tasted like they were mixed very well and just tasted like overly sweet drink mix. We then ordered some food, I got the chicken tacos and he got the philly flatbread. The chicken was very dry and just tasted like it had been reheated and the guacamole was starting to turn brown. I didn't try his flatbread but the toppings on his seemed dry as well. I'm not sure if they just had a bad night or what but I'm always willing to give a place a second chance. Hopefully it will be better next time."}
