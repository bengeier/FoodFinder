{"text":"I hardly ever write reviews unless it is great or horrible. Where do I start. I ordered the filet.. tasteless....i told the waitress she made no offers to fix it. I put A-1 on a filet. gotta be pretty bad to do that. 29.00....my wife ordered chicken ...mediocre. the sides of cauliflower .and the brussel sprouts and sweet potato were unoriginal. Dont let the inventive interior decorating fool u. Disappointed and will never return."}
{"text":"Arrived 6 minutes late for Happy Hour...no leeway offered even though the place was almost empty.  Wait staff was very attentive and helpful.  Ordered CA Burger medium rare.  Burger served was very well done and rather tough and bland.  Burger did not come with any side option of fries...etc. cost $11 I might give them another chance."}
{"text":"Good news, Hand Cut has created a unique, fun vibe to enjoy cocktails and some hand food. Unfortunately wasn't the right vibe for an adult family dinner. We had made reservations for dinner which when arrived, had a table that was super low to the ground and was set up to enjoy cocktails and chit chat, not totally suitable for dinner. It was also set up next to a birthday party was gathering which my brother in law kept getting  hit in the face by purses and butts, awkward. And we didn't want to be rude either to interrupt the festivities.   My dad had ordered the venison - which he was super excited about - and when came out was cold unfortunately twice. My mom ordered a veggie burger that was crumbling by each attempt to bite. Will say their mushroom burger and pulled pork was delicious and on point.   Their service was really great and cocktails were amazing!"}
{"text":"Slow service... Very Loud.. Can't hear each other talk at the table... $3 for non-alcoholic beverage... We walked out.."}
{"text":"Stopped in and only tried appetizers but they were great. Had the salt and vinegar fries rings and wings and they were all excellent.  The bartender Matt was attentive talkative and informative and overall it was a great time. I also tried the strawberry Whiskey cocktail and it was www.bomb.com. Cant wait to come back and try an entree and will likely bump up the stars, can't rate 5 stars on fries and rings after all."}
{"text":"Stopped in while vacationing in Arizona from Portland, ME. We went early with 2 kids and got a table quickly. By 6:30 it was filling up quickly with an adult crowd. My wife and I both had burgers which were fantastic. Staff was also very helpful and accommodating in dealing with small children."}
{"text":"Trendy burger place. A little on the pricy side because it's located in downtown Scottsdale. Cocktail drink was more than mg meal @ $13. The zucchini fries were very tasty though."}
{"text":"We stopped in to hand cut for happy hour and had such a great experience. They have their signature cocktails (happy hour) for the same price that you would buy a well cocktail anywhere else in old town. We also got a bunch of the appetizers to split with our table. Everything came out super quickly and our server was amazing. I would highly recommend this place over and over again!"}
{"text":"Walked in & was able to get a table immediately. Great atmosphere, really cute place. Definitely paying for the environment rather than the food. I got a burger and my boyfriend got a steak. Steak was too rare & got sent back, but the burger and baked potato were decent. Spinach & artichoke dip was really good! Very nice & attentive staff that made sure we got what we wanted! All together our bill was about $80 and I would say for the price it wasn't worth it, nothing too special about the food."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Sophia (our server) was very helpful in selecting the right sweet beer for my \"non-drinking\" date.  We tried the chopped salad with slices of super tender steak and the delicious mushroom burger -- both bursting with flavor.  Without much ado, dishes were served to us already split -- nice touch. Thanks to the attentive hostess on Friday night we have good selfies to remember this place by.   MUST TRY, whether Happy Hour or not!"}
{"text":"Took my family to Hand Cut for a late dinner on mother's day. Service was excellent, all menu choices were grass fed and non GMO and prices very reasonable. We will return without a doubt."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Great burgers and THE BEST salt and vinegar fries with dill and ranch. The Blackberry mojito is amazing, and the butter cake is just ridiculous. The entire staff is super friendly and helpful. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great Food and Service...  Probably the best wings in town.  Don't drink to much because you will have to wait in line to use the bathroom.  There was bathroom lines all night long because only 1 person can use the bathroom at a time.  Pretty ridiculous for a restaurant of this type."}
{"text":"Visited this place last weekend.  Tried a couple of signature cocktails with the fun ice and had a couple of entrees and sides.  Sat at bar.  All very good and great bartender.   Didn't try a burger but will go back and try another time - they looked amazing!"}
{"text":"My friend Jeremy took us to dinner last night because I flew into town to visit him and some friends. The staff seems untrained and if i have to keep asking for things 5+ times I'm not sure what they're doing. I would understand if it was a busy night, but it was only half full. Even when getting our checks, it took about 25 min......  Food was alright, a bit cold, drinks were sub par."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've tried in Arizona! Great service and fun atmosphere. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place gets it.  The best of the upscale burger bars by far.  The blue cheeses burger, medium rare, with salt and vinegar fries was phenomenal - only topped by the service.  I have been many times and the bartenders, all of them, are the best. Thanks for moving in a block away!!"}
{"text":"Go on a Tuesday! Get there early and apps are half price, wine by the glass is $5. The smoked salmon appetizer is incredible and consists of 4 pieces of toasted ciabbata topped with a thin smear of cream cheese, the salmon, arugula, and pickled red onion. Outstanding. On to the steaks (and other \"hand cuts\" )that are half price on Tuesdays. The fillet is excellent, Arizona grass-fed beef. The steaks were perfectly cooked. The place is super casual, small, and service is very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance of this place is beautiful. Eclectic and trendy. Super stoked to be able to enjoy AZ grass fed beef at another place in the Phx area however the food was subpar. Out of 5 of us only 2 of us got the burger temperatures we ordered. Mine was inedible, but my kale salad was delicious. The salt and vinegar fries were yummy especially the dill aioli that accompanied them. The hand cut baked potato wasn't fully cooked and the Brussel sprouts and sweet potato side was full of sugar and also inedible. The glass of wine is listed as 6oz but the actually serving that was poured was no where near that. Service was ok- probably the better part of our experience however it didn't blow me away. Honestly we were all really excited to try this place out, but it's looking like it's another trendy joint that is focused solely on aesthetics and not that actual product it's serving. I hope it gets better, but won't be trying it out again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Roasted cauliflower was amazing. Craft Cocktails good as well. Nice atmosphere. Recommend."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time. 4 of us.Had the fries and the wings as appraisers.  Fries were good. Wings had a very strong overwhelming taste.  Then we had burgers.  The mushroom burger was good.  The blue cheese burger and the chicken sandwich were average.  The California burger was good.  The service was good."}
{"text":"Lobster burger is fantastic! Our server Miranda was absolutely amazing went above and beyond to help celebrate my friends birthday! Defiantly will be back!"}
{"text":"Checked out Hand Cut Chophouse today! Awesome location and great decor. Sit up at the bar for amazing drinks and great service. Mello and Kylee took great care us and were very knowledgeable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Another amazing concept from Riot Hospitality Group!   Nothing less than impressed with the lighting, decor and overall inviting vibe Hand Cut has to offer.   Great menu, powerful flavor profiles, beautiful ambience; in many ways it is a stand-out restaurant right in the heart of old town Scottsdale.   A great addition to the already amazing restaurant line up waterfront has to offer."}
{"text":"The service at this place was terrible. Not only did it take four times as long as it should have to get mediocre food, but they brought it with an attitude. No wonder they've got half a dozen open tables on a Saturday night. As far as my money is concerned, I'll go elsewhere. Good luck to the owners."}
{"text":"Hand Cut just opened a few blocks from my office and my wife and I went for dinner. The restaurant is in a great location in the Southbridge/Fashion Square part of Old Town. A high rent part of Old Town, but with surprisingly reasonable prices. Great date night location. We had the house cab, a chopped salad with goat cheese, wings, and burgers. Great experience. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Met friends here based on recommendation from PBS. If you have party larger than 4/5, may be a cozy seating setup. We had party of 6. Menu explained by very attentive server who explained the grass fed beef concept. Not knowledgeable about seafood entree. I know better than to ask for fish in a chop house. But I really wanted a nice piece of salmon. Wrong restaurant. Chicken sandwich for companion was great. Steak and venison dishes were well prepared. Side dishes were generally good, but cauliflower was overlooked and fries were a little salty. Odd that although I ordered salad as part of meal, it came with entree and the half dozen sides ordered by the table. Server did not ask whether I wanted salad early or with entree. Very odd. Dessert included the buttercake that the servers raved about. Obviously never had homemade cake before.  Very average dinner. Big on Arizona grown beef locally sourced, but that is all that you can say about the place or the food."}
{"text":"Read because I'm only giving 5 stars for one reason: Alexandra   I don't slay restaurants and don't post some stupid foodie-wannabe review reviling the lack of truffle and togarashi on my organic field green salad. That said I experienced some challenges tonight and my review centers on what went right vs. the less than ideal.   I took my family to eat, candidly because the place we wanted to eat claimed a 90 minute wait with no people in line and plenty of available tables (I digress), and we got seated with a good menu and the view of a TV for game. Unfortunately we ran into some issues but the measure of an individual and a company comes from challenge more than the norm.  When we experienced challenge Alexandra showed up and made everything right. She gets its, gets how to run a business, and gets how to ensure customers get taken care of with respect; not some hustle for an alterior motive. I can only say we would come back again just for her and, given a little tenure, I can promise she will run an establishment flawlessly.   Alexandra, we appreciate and admire what you do. Thank you and we will come back to see you any time.   - The Green Family"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a burger Wednesday.  I heard some good things about Handcut so I gave it a try.  Location was nice.  Easy to get to with a garage right across the street.  Plenty of things within walking distance.  The grass fed burgers intrigued me, so I sought some help from the bartender.  She was pleasant and helpful in explaining things.  Decided on the classic burger with the salt and vinegar fries.  Burger was cooked to perfection.  Grass fed is definitely the way to go here.  One of the best i have had.  Fries were tasty without being too salty.  Great experience.  Will go back for a repeat."}
{"text":"Great burgers.  Lousy steak. I have never had a filet that hurt my jaw to eat. There are plenty of places that do steak 10x better for less $.   I would give 5 stars for the burgers. Taking 1 back for the shoe leather."}
{"text":"Anytime my wife and I go somewhere I always give the establishment 3 chances before having negative inclinations. I will not be returning to hand cut for a long time unless something changes. I have noticed over the visits the burgers have gotten drastically smaller, the old fashioned has a mid level bourbon that is priced cheaper on the back of the menu rather than in the drink on the front of the menu. Yet when you order the same drink with a different bourbon it is priced to the alcohol. the service is sub par. After being sat on my most recent my wife had asked for a high chair for our daughter it took 3 requests to get one when there was a maximum of 8 covers in the restaurant... i guess you could consider that \"busy\" for the service staff there? Because that is what it seemed like... there was a hair in my drink and instead of taking care of the drink, an appetizer was taken off the bill which is at least an effort, but I guess it's cheaper to drive up food cost when alcohol is always marked up more than the food. And my burger was undercooked I asked for a medium and it came out rare-medrare. The center of our desert was cold. And the ice cream had crystals in it from refreezing. Overall I will not be recommending it to friends."}
{"text":"What a fun location with delicious food! The decor was fun and the service was perfect! We tried multiple dishes and appetizers between our party of five and all were good. My favorites were the zucchini fries, chicken melt sandwich and the super yummy sweet potato gratin! My husband loved his classic burger. Our family of five never gets to sit in a booth, so we loved their deep booths and my son loved all the TVs . Nothing bad to say. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"great burgers (spinach dip is terrible) and atmosphere but service sucks...SLOWEST service ever and they brought appetizer after burger. it's run so poorly. the key to their success will be their hiring decisions."}
{"text":"Cool setting. The smoke trout was amazing.  Venison chops really good.  A return visit is in order.  Ooh, had to reduce ratings from 4 to 2 starts.  Follow up visit not nearly as good as first two.   Smoked trout was replaced by smoked salmon.  Went from something tastey and unique to something ordinary and bland. Scallops with apple bacon compote had muddy flavors that was unremarkable .  Finally my desert plating was a paper cup with a plastic spoon. The bright spot was server, Sofia.  I'll give one more chance to see how it goes during the season."}
{"text":"This place...I wanted to like it more than I do. I gave it two tries before I gave up.  First time, I asked for no bun...so I only received a burger patty with the cheese. No sauce, lettuce, pickles...the things that normally go on the burger I ordered. I told the waitress, she brought all the goodies on a separate plate. I ordered medium, I received rare.  Second time, our appetizer took FOREVER & was basically a salad.  I thought I'll beat them at their own game & I'll order a gluten-free wrap (why won't they just serve GF buns!??) & order medium-well. I DID get all my goodies this time, but I got rare meat again.  I don't want to go again, try to order WELL & get rare again. So, I quit.   Bottom line, I make better burgers. I can make them with grass-fed beef for under $10 a piece, so I will. The convenience isn't worth it if you don't even get what you want."}
{"text":"salt n vinegar fries were amazing!!!!! the burger was small but tasted amazing!  atmosphere was  great"}
{"text":"Beer and a burger for $10, sign me up! located next to Olive & Ivy, this place offers premium steaks, very good service, and a decent happy hour. If you are very hungry or have a carnivorous friend to share with, try the enormous Tomhawk steak. I hear this place can have a pretty long wait on weekends so I'd probably stick to coming on weekday evenings."}
{"text":"Walked by this place yesterday and boy was I impressed. From the looks of it they really found the perfect balance between chophouse and upscale burger dinning I have already heard awesome things I can't wait to come in and try it out"}
{"text":"While this is definitely a nice place, the Food leaves as lot to be desired..very Overpriced for value received...high Price for average wine...but a very friendly  Staff"}
{"text":"This is my new go-to spot in Old Town either after work or on my lunch break. I was excited to see that they had Avery Brewing Co's White Rascal, a delicious zesty, witbier style beer that I haven't had since I lived in Boulder. I'm also OBSESSED with the Jalapeño Ranch Burger (substitute with grilled chicken and add a side of their aioli sauce). Not to mention Hand Cut has a great, open atmosphere."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the atmosphere and especially the hip music! The meaty menu was good and we ordered burgers for dinner. The were really great and the buns were perfect. The onion rings were 5 startastic! We will be back"}
{"text":"The food IS good. (Avoid the snap peas. They taste only like the soy sauce they are bathed in).  Just don't choose Hand Cut for a business lunch. The music is too loud for serious conversations. You may as well be negotiating in a disco.  What's worse? They won't turn the volume down when you ask -- even if there's only three other occupied tables in the whole place."}
{"text":"Terrible bar service, not knowledgeable at all.  You probably should not display bottles of Bourbon that you don't have available to serve"}
{"text":"First I want to say that I try not to be negative when it comes to reviews but after having a thoroughly terrible experience here I wanted to let people know. It was a friends birthday last night, first time I've ever been there. Service was terrible (won't mention name), she took forever for everything, I had to stop her before she left for her to take my order. When she brought my food to the table she said she be back soon to check on me and to make sure the temperature was good. She never came back!! My steak was definitely not medium, only the middle was medium well at best and the rest of the steak was well done! I got the ribeye and it was almost as chewy as a sirloin! Thank god the Steaks were half off since it was Tuesday, couldn't justify paying for the meal otherwise... they charge almost as much if not the same as mastros or Ruth's Chris!! Wanted to talk to a manager but being my friends birthday and already only paying half off I really didn't want to make a big deal about it. The burgers on the other hand looked awesome and were reasonably priced. My cocktail was crafty but at $13 (more then the burgers) slightly ridiculous. If I were ever to come back, which I probably won't, I would go strictly to try the grass fed burgers! Don't try the steaks! If I ever payed 34 dollars for that steak I'd punch myself!"}
{"text":"Stoped for dinner with my hubby and although the service was outstanding, the food disappointed. Ordered the tempura zucchini fries and the salt and vinegar fries as appetizers. The salt and vinegar fries...amazing! The zucchini...not so much. The tempura batter was uneven and in many places the zucchini did not have any batter and then in other places on it had a clump of batter. Plus, they were a bit greasy. I ordered the chopped salad with grilled chicken and my hubby ordered the classic burger medium well. Before our entrees arrived the manager stopped by and said as a thank you for stopping in they were going to comp one of our appetizers. Nice! My salad was okay but not something I'd order again. They need to add more \"stuff\" to it...it only had a sprinkle of corn, a few blueberries and clumps of goat cheese(too many) with a blueberry balsamic dressing and then the chicken. My hubby's burger was over cooked and very dry. He didn't finish it, which is not like him! Anyway, that's my story.  Maybe we should have sent back the zucchini fries and his burger and maybe I should have ordered a different salad, but we did not. Their menu is extensive and the veggie burger sounded interesting. But I'm not sure if we'll try this place again."}
{"text":"Great space and cool decorating. Bad selection of wine, bad selection of beer. Cocktails appear to be only sugar. Didn't try the food, might be their saving grace, aside from location, because I heard they have an amazing vegetarian burger... but won't be back to sit at the bar. Asked for my check and was told to wait for my server... had been waiting for 20 min...... no thanks."}
{"text":"Yum! Tried this place purely on the aesthetic of the outside, but stayed for the food! I ordered the California burger and our table shared the salt & vinegar fries. Both were high quality and enjoyed by everyone at the table. Staff was very friendly and the location is convenient next to Fashion Square mall. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Lunch was nice. Liked the experience and staff were very good. Salt & vinegar fries was my favorite.  Good, but not *great*. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal and so is the service! Brittney, the manager is so friendly and great at her job. Will definitely be coming back and bringing friends! One of the best happy hours in town!"}
{"text":"This was really a bad choice. They are advertising a steak that they don't even have  in their menu no more, on top of that I went with their second choice steak in their menu, just to find out 10min later that they didn't have it. By the time I made my third choice and my food got to my table the steak I have order seem like a 4oz steak with the price of a 32oz steak house. Really bad experience, I would not recommend this to no one. On my personal opinion this place is more like fast food place not a steak house."}
{"text":"Me and my wife to dinner there on Saturday night with some friends and we highly recommend it. We were in town from LA and found this place on yelp. The environment was great, they had a DJ playing good hits while people were having drinks and dinner. Food was amazing, we had the steak, chicken breast and western burger."}
{"text":"Could be my new favorite restaurant in old town.  The atmosphere is like nothing else in the area, the staff is top notch and the food will keep me coming back. Even for someone who doesn't like beef - the Veggie burger was absolutely incredible.  Love that everything is responsibly sourced."}
{"text":"oh man.... where do I even start. I had a HORRID experience here.   I walked in with my husband soon after they opened the doors one morning. As we made our way to the bar to sit down I noticed that the ENTIRE STAFF was on the phones, hanging out back near the kitchen.. Granted they had just opened for the morning, but there is no excuse for everyone to be on there phones as customers are entering the restaurant. So... We sit down and make ourselves comfortable. Now we wait.... wait for the bartenders (2 guys) get their faces out of their phones and acknowledge our presence. FINALLY one of them put their phone down grabbed us some menus and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. I told him we would start with waters and as soon as our other friend showed up that we would order cocktails. We received our waters and about 5 min later my friend showed up. She sat down after greeting us and looked over at the bartenders to ask for a water and an additional menu. After about 3 min which felt like eternity!!! she looked over at me and asked if she was dreaming. I responded nope just wait and watch.. She did. The two bros behind the counter whom where talking about how hard they partied and all the girls they were seeing the night before completely ignored the fact that we could hear their whole conversation and my friend finally lost her patience and said \"Excuse me but can I please get a menu and some water?!?\" The same one who gave us water prior, apologized and brought her over a water and menu, then turned back around and continued talking to his bro. They continued to sit behind the bar on their phones and gossip. Finally a manager came over and asked them both to go do something, they did but then she (the manager) walked back over towards the kitchen and pulled out her phone and started showing other staff photos on her phone and laughing about who knows what.   We finally ended up ordering or drinks and food 15min later. When the food came out I was SOOO excited to eat because I finally had food in front of me after waiting forever. I took my first bite (a French fry) and NOOOOOOO! It was so salty that I couldn't even eat it!! Next I tried my burger. It was cold :( not frozen or anything but defiantly under room temperature! like it had been sitting in the window forever) I flagged down the bartender and asked him if they could please heat my burger up for me and grab me some new fries. He didn't say anything grabbed my plate and walked back to the kitchen. He then came back over and told me that the kitchen was going to make me a fresh new burger. Well, once I received that new plate (both people i'm with at this point have already finished their meals) I had two or three bites of my average burger and just gave up. It was bland and blahhhh... Nothing good about it! The fries again were way over salted. Both my husband and my friend said their dishes were average and nothing worth writing how about.    Needless to say I'm not impressed with this place. I think there needs to be some majors training sessions with the staff and they have to step up their game!! I'm going to give it a few months before I give it another shot. I was really excited for this place, too bad it missed the mark for me."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our experience at this restaurant. Made our reservation through Open Table and everything was perfectly ready for us on time. Service was excellent for our table of 5 on a very busy night. We had one problem with our order, which was immediately rectified; they deducted the cost of that meal regardless. The food was excellent and very well priced--especially for this location in Scottsdale. Great service, fun and relaxed atmosphere, and great food--we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night with a group of 10, awesome place.  Live DJ, great atmosphere, great food, great service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'd rate this place higher because the service was really great, but the food was so bad I just can't. I was actually walking away from the restaurant after eating and thinking \"wow that was gross\".  Jalisco Valley Bramble ($8 HH) - Tequila and blackberry liqueur, with mint and lemon. This was really great, it was a little sweet but had nice flavor. 4/5  Mushroom Cheddar Burger ($10) - I absolutely love mushroom burgers and if I ever see one on a menu, that's what I'll order. Nothing beats a juicy burger with piles of mushrooms on it and that awesome mushroom flavor. Well this mushroom burger was TERRIBLE. They should rename it the \"Balsamic Vinegar Burger\" - because that is literally all I could taste. I was actually amazed at how I couldn't even taste any mushroom flavor given the amount of mushrooms on the burger. The menu states this burger is \"drizzled with balsamic\". Perhaps they should re-evaluate this statement. 0/5  Western Bacon Burger ($10) - The husband got this one and he liked it.  Sweet Potato Fries ($7) - This is another one of those unfortunate menu miscommunications. The menu states that the sweet potato fries are \"served with chili-lime aioli\". I wasn't sure if I'd like the dip but I knew that if I didn't, I could just eat the fries by themselves. I mean, how hard is it to f up sweet potato fries? When the waitress brought over this basket of fries, the smell was so overwhelming that I actually wanted to gag. The fries were absolutely completely COVERED in spices. I tentatively tried one and all I could taste was paprika. Tons and tons of paprika. It was absolutely disgusting. I tried them with the dip and that tasted even worse. I cannot believe that they wouldn't state on the menu that the fries are covered in this spice mix. 0/5"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch recently and am blown away that I didn't realize this place even existed until now. They have a lunch special, $10 for a burger, fries, and a drink and it was great. As I walked in the hostess greeted me and asked where I would like to sit. Since I was by myself I sat at the bar and just looked around. I was very impressed by the décor and the setup. The place is friendly with a good combination of hightops, booths, tables, and bar seats. It took me a minute to realize that not only does it have an open kitchen style where you can see the food being prepared, there is actually a glass wall next to the South row of booths where you can see the meat being prepared and cut... i.e. Hand Cut!  The bartender was very friendly and answered my questions about the items on the menu. I went with a bacon cheeseburger along with sweet potato fries and a soda. The wait for food was not long and when I got it, it was excellently cooked and delicious.  I will definitely be returning and highly recommend it if you're in the area and looking for a good burger. In fact I'd say it's better than Shake Shack and you get a better atmosphere at a much more reasonable price. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Service was kind of slow... the food we ordered was good though! The burgers are smaller portions as well as the salads, but filling if you aren't crazy hungry. The fries are okay and good for sharing. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant! It has modern/hip decor and nice seating."}
{"text":"Was not sure what to expect. It's an eclectic feel, but overall nice appearance, although the layout of tables in the front is a bit cluttered and confined. Service was prompt and very nice overall. When trying somewhere new, the food is what makes or breaks a visit, not the decor or even service. Our table ordered 4 entrees and only one person was satisfied and appeased by their meal. I can only personally speak for my dishes, the lobster mac and cheese was not anything to rave or crave; it was noodles with a subpar béchamel. Did I mention it was lobster mac and cheese? Well there was not a piece of lobster to be found, but it did have an overly powering essence of seafood, that reminded me of a mothers tuna casserole. I ordered the 18oz bone in NY strip, it was a decent steak but again nothing Overly special; for myself nothing was overly satisfying, and this will more then likely be my first and last visit."}
{"text":"Looks nice....waitress was great....They serve flat soda I was told that the way it is....I had to go to the Pizza shop next door to get a glass of soda....We had 4 burgers all were over cooked.....mac an cheese was cold....cauliflower augratin was cold .... French fry cold....cost 115.profit bad food"}
{"text":"First time here and awesome atmosphere and not a long wait for a Friday night!   The steaks were delicious and the pork chop also!   Loved the spinach artichoke appetizer and sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus all perfect!   It's ala carte but delicious!"}
{"text":"Checked out this new spot on a recent Friday night. They have the text message wait system, but it was just a short 20 minute wait around 8pm. We got lucky and had some prime outdoor seats (The green chairs look padded, but are clearly not). Ashley was quite a nice waitress and we proceeded to cash in on my free app.coupon with the $10 new Spinach dip. A more upscale version served with toast points and the dip itself shined with a garlicky taste and a big surprise of raisins...yep secret ingredient perhaps?     Our burgers ($9 and $11) were cooked well, mine was actually crisp on the edges. Just had the classic, but the bun was squishy soft and it reminded me of an upscale Big Mac with the sauce they use. Not a fried egg fan, but the mushroom cheddar burger with egg got good reviews. Also, they have half orders of onion rings at $3 (not on the menu), but those panko crusted rings are worth an order. Good addition to the area."}
{"text":"Loved the happy hour selections, and the burgers were delicious.  We were visiting for the weekend, but I look forward to stopping in the next time we are out there."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying that I wanted to love this place so much. I had such high hopes. We waited 1 hour for a table on a Friday evening around 7:30pm. We shopped around and came back around 8:30pm. After sitting down and ordering, we waited 40 more minutes for our meal (just basic burgers and fries). Finally, around 9pm, we got our food and started eating, and it was quite possibly the worst burger I've ever had. I ordered it medium well and it was rare. The burger was rock hard on the outside, and the meat was super stringy and overcooked (yet raw throughout the entire inside). I ordered the \"Californian\" burger that was supposed to come with avocado and sweet potato shoestrings, and they forgot all of my toppings. I asked the waiter for my toppings and he brought me a BROWN avocado slice and 1 tablespoon of sweet potato crumbs (no joke). I took 1 bite of my burger, doused in ketchup, and just couldn't even stomach the rest. The waitstaff was nice, but I just could not see myself paying $15 for a burger that literally way worse than I could ever get at a fast food restaurant.  Overall, we wont be back. Again, I'm so bummed that this place wasn't a win. I'm always looking for a new spot to grab a burger on the weekend, but this place definitely was not it. :(  Final heads up: The music is SUPER loud. There is a live DJ which is pretty cool, but the music wasn't conducive to a restaurant setting. I love a good scene, but I couldn't even talk to my boyfriend without shouting."}
{"text":"Grass fed beef not seasoned well, so fairly tasteless. Asked for ice tea that never arrived.  Not a stellar lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious and farm to fork. We came here on a whim, and were super impressed and happy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a friend recommend this place and it was awesome. The staff and bartenders were friendly and informative as it was our first time. (Sorry, I forget their names). Wonderful cocktails while we watched the Cav\"s game.   Started with the salt and vinegar fries which were awesome. Moved onto grass fed Western burger which did not disappoint. Everything was hot and fresh. I also ordered the creamed corn which was probably my favorite item! It's rare places even offer creamed corn but absolutely worth it.    Lastly, Adam, one of the managers brought us over a peach cobbler and ice cream dessert that complemented our dinner perfectly. Adam spent extra time with our group to make sure our first time was a memorable one. I think I have found one of my new favorite places.  Big shout out to the staff and management."}
{"text":"Okay. Hands down, best. Burger. Ever. That is a pretty bold statement from me considering my grandparents own a beef ranch and I've never had a restaurant or \"store bought\" patty come within a fraction of the ones we make at home. I had the blue cheese burger. Wow!! The most juicy, flavorful patty (slightly misshapen you could tell it had just been ground and gently formed into patty shape and not over handled). Great choice on buns because they are good but not really noticed since it's what's inside that is the star (not too bready, not dry, just good). The toppings omg mmm. Perfectly cooked. I need another now!   My only regret was ordering the sides. The mac and cheese is rather plain and the sauce kind of thick/goopy and bland. Brussels and sweet potato, again very plain. Neither were bad though we ate it all. The salt and vinegar fries could rally be spectacular if they quadrupled the amount of salt vinegar seasoning! I wish they had a shake menu.   Next time going for just the burger. Would have been 4stars but the burger is so over the top good I have to give them all 5!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The decor dragged us in, we were just walking by. The decor is very funky and chic all the details and decorations reminded me of a funky juicy couture store. If you get a cocktail try the bramble it was delicious and recommended to me by the waitress. We had an awesome waitress so friendly and attentive, I cannot remember her name. Me and my friend both had the kale salad and I added salmon which was delicious! I will defiantly be coming back"}
{"text":"Really unique cocktails with hand made ice cubes and fresh fruits. Loved the bar area and bartenders Kylie and Carmelo were so cool. They'll make you anything you want. Great eclectic decor. Good music playing too. We will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! We went and couldn't decide so we tried some of everything.  We had the burgers, the beets and burrata, snap peas, kale slaw, fries, onion rings, chicken sandwich ...  and everything was absolutely wonderful.   I wish we lived closer as I would eat here all the time!  This is definitely a place I will be back too.  Oh, and the service was great as well.  Loved the ambiance and all the design.  So comfortable... can't say enough good."}
{"text":"Looking avoid the spring training crowds piling into all of the usual places in old town we found this not so hidden spot near the Scottsdale Waterfront.   Having arrived after happy hour but before the dinner crowd, we were immediately seated at a table with a view of both the bar and semi-open kitchen with my back to the front of the restaurant.   The drink and appetizer orders were taken after giving us a few minutes to review the menu.   I had the steak salad medium rare which came out perfectly cooked on a bed of arugula accompanied by all the ingredients as described on the menu all of which paired well and complemented each other to make a satisfying light dinner.     While reviewing the dinner choices I had a chance to observe the bartender concocting a few interesting drinks requiring a number of steps and ingredients with obvious skill and practice, unfortunately, I was driving so my review of the beverages will have to wait for the next round.    Early evening we appeared to be just far enough out of sight of crowded bars on Scottsdale Road to have a relaxing casual dinner with a few friends but by the time we left most of the tables were occupied I just hadn't noticed as I had my back to the crowd and the noise never increased to a level where we couldn't have a conversation."}
{"text":"I'm here now and this place is incredible. I ordered the burger and fries and it's the best burger I've ever had. The burger is something I know I will be craving in the future. The service is great. We sat at the bar & our bartender Sam was very knowledgeable & very helpful. We never waited for anything. I'm excited about this place & love the design."}
{"text":"Amazing! This is probably my new favorite burger place in Scottsdale! The food was just to die for! The salt and vinegar fried are seasoned so well and just different enough to make them a novelty, our burgers were juicy, and flavors all around delicious! Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Portions very small and overpriced. Don't take a group of hungry men here because you'll leave hungry and poor. Everything tastes good and stuff but I literally hit the drive thru on the way home at del taco."}
{"text":"I really hope to come back and update, but they have some major customer service flubs to overcome. Right off the bat, the hostess was very flustered. She was definitely giving off some serious anxious vibes.   Our waitress was very nice and attentive, but she was definitely spread way too thin. She had tables all over the entire restaurant and I think was pretty stressed about it. Regardless, she was on top of it with getting our orders and refilling drinks, etc. This always really annoys me, as I think it's a huge management flaw - i.e. they are too cheap to have enough staff working at once. It's a Thursday in Old Town in the Spring, you gotta anticipate a lot of people coming in.   The main issue was how SLOW the kitchen was. It was decently busy - definitely nothing crazy though. We were sat about 7:15 (Thurs night) and it was probably a little over half-full inside. We ordered the artichoke dip app and it took quite a while to get it. The worst, though, was that it took over an HOUR to get two burgers. They were just normal, right off the menu, burgers with no special modifications. My friend and I were getting pretty hangry. It was nearing 9 PM and our casual, quick bite was turning into a looooong dinner (with no food). Finally, my friend stopped who I think was the manager and asked her if our food was coming soon. She was super nice and quickly came back with our food. She was apologetic about it and even comped part of our bill.   The food itself was really yummy. I got the mushroom burger with an egg, and it was cooked perfectly and had lots of flavor.   Since the food is so delicious, the ambiance is cute, and the location is great, I would probably come back and give it another try. I hope they speed up the kitchen ASAP and properly staff up!"}
{"text":"After being seated we were ignored. Asked for water and after 10 minute wait still no service. Seemed like wait staff didn't know who was assigned to our table. It was our first time and expected much more after other reviews. All this and the restaurant was not crowded. We decided to leave and dine at Olive and Ivy. Better choice."}
{"text":"Totally Unsatisfied.  Went with two friends and they said it was ok... my filet was hard as a Rock!   Was over priced for what I got. And the waiter actually poked and squeezed my steak with his hand when I said it was not good!!! Who does that!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome and unique ambiance which makes Hand Cut stand out from other restaurants in Scottsdale. Service was excellent! The Peach Ambrosia cocktail, creamed corn and smoked trout will have me visiting often!"}
{"text":"We LOVED everything about this place! From beginning to end, and even the day after! The entrance is beautiful, the service is attentive, the food is hot and delicious!! We will be back, I have already told 3 friends!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. Very nice, upscale atmosphere. The burgers were great. I really liked the Chipotle BBQ sauce. The service was only ok in the beginning even though it was pretty quiet at late lunch, but got much better once we ordered. Enjoyed it and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe as soon as we got here. We checked it out on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised that they had happy hour! 2pm - 6pm everyday.   We sat at the bar and I had a great time watching the bartenders show their skills! Their cocktails look amazing, I want to try them all! Luckily they had a good IPA on tap for my BF too.   We ordered the salt and vinegar fries, cali burger with fried egg and the mushroom burger. I like salt and vinegar chips so I was very intrigued with their salt and vinegar fries! It was amazing, but what even made it better was the house ranch that came with it.  I liked the cali burger better than the mushroom. I thought that the balsamic was too overwhelming. I felt like it was overpowering the burger. I still enjoyed my meal though!   Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers that are well cooked. We appreciated that medium actually came out medium and was juicy with great flavor. All of the burgers are grass fed. Sides are a la carte and shareable. We recommend the mac and cheese and asparagus."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Cool atmosphere. In the middle of old town. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Nothing worse than a stale bun, but even the fries where old and warmed up. You would think this was bad drive up fast food at 3 times the price."}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty good, but I had some serious concerns about the staffs ability to handle food allergies. I alerted my waitress of an allergy to dairy (not preference- allergy) when we got there, and again when I ordered. When I received my food, it was fortunate that my sister noticed it looked like they had put cheese on my burger. I opened up the bun, and sure enough, there were remnants of pieces of cheese like they had put cheese on and scraped it off at the last minute. This is not just unacceptable, but dangerous. Hiding the fact that an allergen had been placed in my food and then serving it anyway is incredibly irresponsible. We alerted the staff, and they remade my food and comped our bill... so at least they knew a big mistake had been made. Out of sheer fear of it happening again, however, I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I came here with eight of my employees to have a nice team dinner. As we walked in there was barely 3 customers in the restaurant at about 5:30 PM on a Monday afternoon.  We sat down and we were prompted by a server who took our drinks. She was clearly new as she had a person shadowing her the entire time.  We gave her a chance and her trainer too.   The reason why I'm giving three stars is because of the dinner we ordered six or seven main courses one of them being a $54 phone in New York steak that came out completely well done when we asked for medium rare. The other dishes also came out not to our preferance as the salmon piece was broken up and not one whole piece. As we were telling our waitress that the state was hard she said that she would discount the steak and tell her manager.   Well, nothing happened.   On top of that, The fire alarm went off in the middle of our dinner and lasted for 9 minutes.  Fire truck came and everything.  The place was dead that night. It never filled up."}
{"text":"Hand cut is so beautiful on the inside and everyone is so nice. However the steak isn't that great for the price. I'd rather pay a little extra and go to a Mastros for a steak.  Also, I've had exactly every appetizer on the menu and nothing is worth having again. I find myself at this place more than I'd like because the cocktails are excellent and the vibes are just so trendy.  PS do not try the steak tar tar it's probably the worst thing I've ever had and I've had it at a couple other places so I know what it can taste like and well no just don't."}
{"text":"I love when the vibe of a restaurant, the food, and the service all come together to form the perfect night out. We were able to get a reservation on the grand opening night and they did not disappoint. Every table was full, the DJ was playing, and the service was on point! We pretty much sampled the whole menu with our large group.. Salt and vinegar fries are AMAZING!!! The best start to our dinner. Followed by the creamy corn and Mac n cheese, both amazing as well. Steak was cooked to perfection and the cheeseburger (topped with bacon and onion rings) did NOT suck! Thank god for stretchy jeans because we finished the night off with an ice cream cookie sandwich.. Some of the best local ice cream, and the mint chocolate chip cookie is to die for! I will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails, yummy fries, good burgers, bad service.  My burger would have been AH-amazing had it been medium rare like I ordered but there was no pink at all.  If the kitchen figures how to cook beef and the servers get it together this place would be perfect!  I'd still go back for the fries and a cocktail for sure."}
{"text":"In my quest to find new places in the Phoenix area, I came across Hand Cut. I unfortunately missed happy hour, but it was all good, we still got to enjoy the menu and their fries! I got their variation of a french dip or steak sandwitch was pleasantly surprised. Great flavors and great appetizers to share. They are typically busy and staff is running around. The atmosphere is interesting as well, outside they have a farm like ambiance, with fake animals and fake grass and inside there are some trendy chandeliers."}
{"text":"Saw Matt at the bar for lunch, great bartender and very knowledgeable. Burgers were great but the cocktails are the star of the show. Will return to this place often."}
{"text":"Happy hour review. 1/2 priced apps and all signature cocktails $8 (regular $13). We tried the Bramble and the One Two Punch. Both were delicious though the One Two Punch was true to its name and quite strong.  The plate of Tempura Zucchini Fries greatly exceeded my expectations. It was a huge platter and so good!!"}
{"text":"We all really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was yummy.  Prices were fair.  The family loved the truffle mash potatoes.  We would recommend it for all."}
{"text":"We had a reservation and got in right away. The noise level was moderate and at times had a hard time hearing people, but not the noisiest restaurant I've been in. The service was excellent and the food tasted amazing! Their drink and food menu has a great variety. We had the Zucchini Fries as an appetizer. The zucchini was cooked and tender and the outside was still crispy, which is not always the case at other places. The 8 oz filet was excellent and cooked perfectly. You're able to order your burger with a lettuce wrap, which is a nice option to cut down on some calories if you want. We ordered the Mushroom & Cheddar burger and the California Burger which were both very good. You can tell the beef is high-quality. The asparagus and snow peas as sides were great sides to have and had unique flavors. The onion rings were nice and crispy and had great flavor as well. I would recommend to a friend and go back myself!!"}
{"text":"New place that stays open late. Came in to check it out and were seated on the couch. It's not really comfortable to eat at the couch and is more for lounging and maybe enjoy a cocktail. Next time I would prefer a table.   The water they serve tastes like toilet water, after three lemon wedges, it still tasted horrid. They need filtered water ASAP it was truly so gross that I didn't have another sip the whole night. They were also very eager to clean up the table before we had an opportunity to finish.   Their hand cut fries were really good and the mushroom burger was great too. They also have a dessert for birthday celebrations with ice cream sandwiches and candy with sparklers!!! $24  It's a nice place and I will be back but that water is a   Deterrent for sure."}
{"text":"Super cute place! I loved the decor. The service was very refreshing and fast! Right away we were greeted by the host and hostess and they were friendly. Our server was great and the food was delicious! We split the western burger and Mac and cheese and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. I only eat grass fed meat & was happy that there was a place in Scottsdale that served just that. I asked another couple to join us & reservations were made for Saturday evening at 6:30pm. The best thing about the place was we got right in at our reservation time. The decor is really well done, televisions for watching college football which was perfect for the guys. The great experience stopped there. We ordered drinks from the specialty drink menu, they were served in glasses that looked like they were child sized. For $12 I could take 3 sips and finish the drink, total rip off! We all ordered burgers and when they arrived, all four were not cooked as ordered. Two of us ordered well done and the burgers arrived medium/rare, the other two arrived rare and were ordered medium. My husband sent his back & we all ate what was served (didn't want to wait) a half hour later no burger ever arrived for my husband. At that point, he just said forget it & ate some of the side dishes, which were also very small servings & just ok tasting. The classic burger which I ordered did not even come with a tomato, I had to ask for it to be added & was charged! I realize they just opened a month ago & usually give a new restaurant 6 months before going, but thought how hard can it be to cook a burger they way you ask?? If they can't get that simple task accomplished, then they don't have a prayer. They will do well because of the location, but as a local, I will stick with Zinburger!!"}
{"text":"I love it when someone introduces me to a new restaurant. I had never heard of Hand Cut Burgers until my buddy took me hear after a stroll through the Scottsdale art walk. They are located next to the Scottsdale Waterfront across from Scottsdale Fashion Square. Riot Hospitality Group (EL Hefe, Dierks Bentley) is the brains behind this concept. Hand Cut really pushes clean eating and uses locally produced 100% grass-fed beef (no hormones or antibiotics) for their burgers. Recently their California Burger placed in a burger competition. During evening hours they are a full service chophouse that uses high quality meats. Burgers run around $10 but you can grab their B.F.D. deal around lunchtime and get fries and a drink added in for the same price. Check in on Yelp and get a free side of their salt & vinegar fries. The fries are pretty amazing and the dill topping really adds to the flavor. I ordered the Jalapeño Ranch Burger and found the burger really fresh and delicious. They really make a good burger here and I highly recommend trying one of them. I sat at the bar and thought our bartender was very knowledgeable and passionate about his job. The restaurant itself is beautiful with an open kitchen and butcher prep area so you can watch them prepare their meats. Menu is limited to burgers and fries during late hours and they have a nice selection of craft beers, cocktails & fine wines. They use meat cleavers as handles on their front door which adds to the experience of visiting here."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had great service and amazing food!  We shared the following sides: garlic fries, zucchini fries, chicken wings, Brussel sprouts & sweet potatoes, and the mac & cheese.  All were fantastic especially the Wings.  Ordered the Western Burger (add a fried egg you will be happy you did!)"}
{"text":"Ordered beer, filet, and asparagus. Beer: 4/5 decent selection and not too pricey for Scottsdale. Filet: 4/5 the seasoning is amazing, the medium was more like medium-well. The flavor of the steak itself is average. I went on a Monday but if you go on Tuesday, \"cuts\" are half price. Asparagus: 3/5 various thickness asparagus require different cooking times. Flavor was very mild, didn't notice the hint of lemon.  Service: 4/5 restaurant was fairly quiet this evening but not all items were attended to right away and various small items were left out (debris under the bar, steel knife sharpener in the kitchen area on the south side, no hostess the last 90 minutes of opening, etc.)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few coworkers. This cute little place is literally walking distance from work so figured this place recently opened up and why not try it? When you walk in you order at the desk and pick a seat. They have a bar section and sofas inside for seating as well as outside seating. Silverware is placed inside cute blue mason jars. Water and unsweetened tea has its own section. The tea is delicious must try. The decoration is gorgeous. I ordered the kale salad which had Parmesan cheese, broccoli, collieflower and I decided to add chicken. The salad dressing was Caesar and it came with some soft croutons which are delicious. Must try their French fries. The have a variety which were all delicious. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"An amazing place to go, the food and desserts are both amazing, the atmosphere was great, and the servers were very helpful and nice.  I recommend the filet even though it is a bit pricey [still totally worth it though] with some fries or pasta.   Recommendation: 96.8%"}
{"text":"We made reservations for 20 and our group went to 35! The food was delicious.  The staff was accommodating. Drinks and service was efficient! You can relax, watch the game, and chill with friends."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Hand Cut after reading the great reviews...especially after being so new! We stopped in for lunch today and loved it.  The vibe is quite cool...great furniture, open concept and bright colors.  Service was good - pretty efficient and friendly.  The food was delicious - I thoroughly enjoyed my mushroom and cheddar burger and we shared the baked potato.  Everyone at the table was pleased...the regular burger and the chicken sandwich too!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend opening day and I was seriously impressed with the interior. When they first opened you had to order before you sat down and then find a table. That wasn't logical for that place hence why they changed it and made it way better. Now you sit down and order. I love the burgers there. They're so light and delicious. They have added a lot more items on the menu which I was really thrilled about. I got the California burger and fries. DELICIOUS. It just melt in your mouth. There desserts there are amazing too. You must go if you haven't. You won't be let down!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place. Started out good - the appetizers were yummy, but did take forever to come out. Then the wait was over 45 min for two burgers. Our side order of fries came before the burgers and were very overdone. The burgers were ok. There was so much oil on the buns I couldn't even eat it. There seems to be a million people working here and no one could refill my water without me asking. It seemed like the staff was way more interested in flirting with each other than actually doing their jobs. Our waitress did take off the appetizers, which was nice, but we will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"This place is more like a bar that serves food.  Music is really loud and the burgers are ok.  If you want a great burger goto in and out.  It's cheaper and way better."}
{"text":"Went here twice. Enjoyed the burger, wings and the zucchini fries. All was real good. The zucchini fries were well seasoned and the wings were all flats. The sauce on them was a tad too citrus tasting for my personal liking. Saw that they had half price on wine and steak selection on Tuesdays which seems like a very reasonable deal...might be back then"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service was slow. Food was good, not great but good. For the price I wouldn't be in a rush to get back but I would go back if in the area."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in this place. My server, Miranda was very welcoming and made my experience that much better. I ordered everything she offered on the menu and I was surprised on how good everything tasted. The steak and Brussels sprouts were amazing. I highly recommend this place! Thanks Miranda for the great experience. Definitely will come back and see her."}
{"text":"Had a great time out it was the evening of the Mayweather-MacGregor fight and we were in the mood for a nice dinner after being unable to find seats down the street to watch the fight.  We ended up seeing the fight anyways...but my girlfriend seems to like to find burgers that taste like Big Mac's and she found one here.    I need to get a silicone ice cube tray because they had some awesome ice cube game going on.  I went for the pulled brisket grilled cheese and it was amazing.  The house wings were started with were very tasty.  It was a great time and I'd head back in an instant.  Some nights you'll have vendors for different liquor brands and this evening we got shirts and free shots of Southern Comfort.  So definitely keep that moving because I love free shots and shirts."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and while all other restaurants nearby were packed, this place had only a few people dining. Our server started out by telling us everything she likes on the menu and when asked if they could make a simple alteration to dish for allergy reasons, she was quite put off.  Ordered a side salad because it said it was only baby greens and vinaigrette but then came with corn, blueberries and cucumbers, two of which I am very allergic to. It's so important to include all ingredients so people aren't served something they aren't aware of and allergic to. My husband had a bib lettuce wrap the lettuce was dirty still. We won't be back and I think the others around us felt the same way. It's too bad because Phoenix has a lot of stiff competition and it's not easy competing with the other fantastic spots in the area. They have a good concept, but are missing the mark."}
{"text":"This place is BEAUTIFUL!  The entire time we were commenting on how there was so much to look at and take in.   Staff: Friendly. Think hipster glam barn.   Food: Great burgers on par with many other specialty burger places in the area.  Very yummy but didn't blow me away.  For the price I expected it to blow me away.   Fries: Are served separately from the burger.  They were good but with how many specialty sauces they have on the menu for the burgers you would think they would take it one step further and serve it with a house sauce of some sort.  Good.  More a place I think I would want to hang out for a late night lounge more than a lunch meal though."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place in old town to eat. After I looked at the menu and some reviews I thought we would give it a try. It looked great. The location is awesome. And the ambiance is really cool. My husband and son had the burger. They said it was fantastic. I had a chopped salad. It could have had more veggies in it. Kinda boring. My daughter had the kale salad. She said it was just ok. I also had cauliflower gratin. It was delicious. I wanted to lick the bowel.  We did enjoy some cocktails. I had a drink that had tiny edible flowers in it. Kinda too sweet and overpriced for the rock glass.  I would go back but I don't think it will be a go to place."}
{"text":"I have a few complaints about this restaurant, enough to make me not go there.   My biggest complaint about this restaurant is the seating. There is a complete lack of regard or consideration for anyone who is in a wheelchair. The majority of the seating is either high tables or booths that are right by the bar. How is someone in a wheelchair supposed to comfortably be seated at a booth with people sitting at the bar directly behind them moving their chairs? Wheelchair-accessible seating is not designated to booths in the first place; it should be a normal low table. The lower tables are outside, what a complete lack of regard for ALL customers. (not to mention I think there are only 2-3 regular tables outside). The majority of the seating should be low, with some high tables. I will not support a business that doesn't provide adequate seating to all customers.   Second, the waitresses are annoying. When I came here with my mom and my husband, the waitress kept calling my husband \"sweetie, honey\" etc. Sorry, but if I wanted to hear a waitress talk that way I would go to Hooters. It made him uncomfortable and it was completely uncalled for.  Third, the first and ONLY time I got a drink from the bar it came with a beautiful lip mark already on it. It was apparent that someone obviously took a sip out of it before bringing it to my table. There are a lot better places out there, skip this one."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this place and went for dinner after seeing the great reviews. Plus they offer free salt and vinegar fries with a yelp check-in. Yaaas! Salt and vinegar chips are my favorite, they may make my mouth feel like sand paper but they are so addicting I can't get enough! But I digress..   The night we came here, it was busy so obviously we had to wait. We couldn't even sit at the bar so we had to stand awkwardly in the way. The drinks were tasty. There was a lot to choose from and the combinations in the cocktail were pretty genius. Pricey for the amount you got, but it's a trendy Scottsdale restaurant.   We waited FOR.EVER. Which is why one star is knocked off. There were several staff just hanging out and chatting while one person was cleaning and turning over tables. I was so hungry I wanted to clean a table myself so we could be seated.  On to the food. The salt and vinegar fries were everything I dreamed they would be. Perfection! We also got the bacon mac and cheese and the creamed corn. First of all, bacon mac and cheese is LIFE but it could've been more cheesy and the breadcrumbs were a little too crispy, almost stale. And there wasn't enough bacon. The creamed corn was probably my favorite thing we got. I'm not the biggest fan of corn but I wanted to take a bath in this dish it was so amazing. Marry it and have its babies. If you ever come here, ORDER IT. We also shared the 8oz filet. I wanted it cooked medium rare and my friend wanted medium so they actually cut it in half and we got our own mini which was nice. We added on the garlic butter mushrooms but they put them in a dish on the side which was weird. Like I wanted them added onto the steak, which I thought was implied with the term \"add-on\". But whatever.   All in all, the food was fabulous. The service was not. We waited so long for everything. It seemed like we had a few servers not just one. Maybe her section was overly busy? I didn't get a drink I ordered and she didn't even apologize just said, \"oh I forgot to put it in\" and walked away. I would recommend this place and come back again in a heartbeat if it wasn't for the service. That would be my only hesitation because I get HANGRY. So you should definitely go to this place, just not when you're starving. And be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"This place has such a cool vibe. Unfortunately, the food was not what I had hoped. Ordered two burgers. One sat up in the window for around 10mins...with our fries. When it was delivered to us it was over cooked. We sent it back and the cook said it was mid rare. It was hardly pink. They refused to make a new one.   The overall wait time for the food was 45min. There were several open tables so it wasn't that busy. Several times I saw the cook in the back text messaging on his phone.  My soda was empty during most of my meal. The waitress never came back to check on us, we had to have a runner help us.  This place is in a great location, has a cool vibe...yet...will soon be out of business if customers get the service we did.  I won't be going back.  --------------------------------- So I went back...and really happy I did. Tuesday's 1/2 price cuts are a great deal. Don't miss out"}
{"text":"I ordered the Bone in NY steak and it was cooked perfectly for me. The house sauce they had on top of it was amazing as well. Servers were super courteous and friendly. The ambience was pretty cool, it could be romantic and it could be chill, depends where u sit I guess. But overall, I had a great time and very satisfied."}
{"text":"All good. Stopped in for libations. Cool spot. Love the decor. The help are all gorgeous!"}
{"text":"Great place. The interior is gorgeous and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Wow wish I would have tired sooner! Had the Cali burger on a lettuce wrap. Great flavors cooked perfectly and was hot! Salt and vinegar fried hit the spot too. The wings were good, had a little honey flavoring on the end!"}
{"text":"So many things wrong with this place and too many great restaurants nearby to return here!   1. Order a buffalo trace bourbon old fashioned as I noticed several bottles of buffalo trace bourbon displayed around the bar and restaurant. I then am approached by a sommelier with a bad attitude who tells me \"those are just for display.\" Really it's a $25 bottle of bourbon, it should be for sale. So stupid and unaccommodating.   2. Filet was over cooked. Ordered medium and it came out well done.   3. One men's and one women's single bathroom for the entire restaurant and bar. There was a line outside of both bathrooms and when I asked if there was any more bathrooms, I was told no because this building was previously a clothing store and bathrooms were not needed. Well guess what you started a restaurant in old town and you have two single facilities for the entire place. Big time fail!  Lastly I was ill all night suspiciously from the food. I will never return under any circumstances. My money will be better spent elsewhere and so should yours."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Luckily my friends and I snatched 4 spots at the bar despite how busy it was! Emily behind the bar was sweet and attentive. The glassware was a little musky.. lipstick stains and kind of smelled like dirty dishwater however the food made up for it. The wings and fried zucchini were delicious and the hand-crafted cocktails were impressive. The bar was tiny and the bartenders seemed to be stumbling all over each other. Personally I would knock out the ice cream bar (which wasn't being used), shift some tables around, and expand the bar.  Overall Hand Cut was amazing, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service!   On Wednesday evening, my husband and I as well as his cousins met here for dinner. Since I don't go to Scottsdale much during the week, I was surprised to see that he restaurant was kinda busy on a week day. The menu is not extensive but they have a nice selection of steaks, burgers, sandwiches, appetizers and sides. Everything is served a la carte, so there are no \"meals\". Instead, you order the burger for example, and you have to order the fries separately if you want the burgers and fries combination. The burgers are priced very reasonably at $9+ I ordered the classic kind of burger. The steaks are a bit more pricey at around $36 for the most expensive one. 2 of us ordered steaks and 3 ordered the burgers. We ordered three different burgers, all of which turned out to be delicious. The steak, based on what I got as feedback from my husband's cousins was superb! We also ordered the salt and vinegar fries on the side, the onions rings and the truffle mashed potatoes, all of which I thought were excellent.   We were all very pleased with the quality of the food. The prices were also average. One thing that I really liked is the way our dishes were served. 3 waiters served all our food at the same time. I thought that was very cool!   I will definitely be returning to try more of their menu options particularly, their steak!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try this place ever since it opened. It looked amazing (from the outside). Needless to say we were beyond disappointed. We were seated at a table that had the booth covered in crumbs and food and the table was the same with multiple areas of sticky mess. Ordered my burger medium well. Waited 45 minutes for the food. It was medium rare. The mac N cheese was plain and tasted like it was out of a box. Fries... meh... eatable but not notorious. There was some kind of particle chunk poured into my water. Just overall a huge disappointment. And $16 for a burger and fries?? We will not be back."}
{"text":"The burger was fantastic only to be out done by the hand made ice cream sandwich. The decor is great and has a very cool feel. Staff was prompt even though they were very busy. Great place, would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"Very eclectic vibe, with a variety of burgers and chops, as well as craft cocktails. I'd like to come back and try a few more items, I had the Venison Rib Chops as my entrée and it was very good, but their app selection isn't as great as it could be. We went opening night, and service was a little slow, we sort of expected such. Their burger selection however, is where I'm most interested."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent steak and don't want to break the bank come here.  I usually get the NY or the ribeye, very straight forward steak and not a ton of extras. Sides are optional, I do not recommend the salt and vinegar fries - they were not good. One issue I have is that the restaurant could be half full and they act as if there is a line out the door, but for the price (peep my pro-tip below) you really can't find a place that offers steaks for these prices.  Pro-tip: come on Tuesdays, the steaks are half off and the wine is also reduced."}
{"text":"Do not come here for dinner!!!!  The music is so loud you cannot hear yourself think!  Waitstaff says they'll talk to the sh but actually didn't.  Very patronizing.  Good food can not overcome the fact you cannot hear your waiter nor can she to take your order."}
{"text":"Well, visually it is pleasing. fun colors and atmosphere. I ordered the wings and the tempura zucchini. I was actually really excited to eat here as it was a recommendation from a local and friend. Well, I think I pissed off the server because she was very tiny and I called her short. Like a wow you're really tiny way, as in I was surprised about her height and once we got got our food. We never saw her again. So maybe she is a heightest.   The wings were interesting. Flavorful but not to my taste. The atmosphere is also loud so don't try to have. Conversation. The tempura zucchini was average and lacked flavor. Wife got a burger. Average. Go to rehab burger therapy. Tastes better and is cheaper."}
{"text":"The venison was great. Tasty. Temperature was perfect. I had this entree twice now. The ambience is relaxed. You can have a good time to chat. Not noisy even though people are taking.   I'm taking out a star for one reason. Our server did not fill our drinks. Not sure if that's her job or someone else's. I could have obviously called this issue to her attention so no big deal.   I recommend this place. Price is great. Quality of food is like The Keg or Fleming's."}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a week.  Their steak, jalapeño burger, hot wings,  salmon appetizer, and ice cream  are my favorites ...nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good burger place.  Good reviews so we stopped.  Saturday night, said it eas open til midnight.  At 10:47 the hostess tells us the kitchen clised early because it was slow. Dont pist hours you arent goung to kerp.  We went out if our eay to come here.  NOT COOL"}
{"text":"Excellent and suburb food, drink and service. Ashley is terrific and very pleasant, professional and always smiling. Without a doubt the hit of our visit to this new culinary adventure in Scottsdale, AZ PS Haylee is learning from the best and will be Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  The sides are probably my favorite... the Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes, the creamed corn, the macaroni... amazing! This is a must go to spot!  Not to mention the old fashion I had was delicious as well."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for dinner last week and it was awesome! Very modern atmosphere, awesome service, delicious food. Our waitress was knowledgeable and helped us choose what to order. I cant remember which cocktail I got but it was perfect - not too strong. For appetizer we got the salt and vinegar fries (a favorite) and spinach dip. Would definitely order the fries again, but probably not the spinach dip. Originally, the fries didn't sound like something I would normally order but our waitress talked us into it and they were awesome! For dinner, I got the crispy chicken sandwich and my fiancé got the blue cheese burger. Both were fantastic and very generous sizes. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family on a Friday night.  The wait time was about 40 minutes.  When we walked in, there were probably 12 tables open, mainly 4-tops.  The wait didn't need to be that long.  They were either understaffed or wanted to push seating past happy hour.    The food is priced pretty well.  The burgers are grass-fed and are in the low $10s.  Sides are unusual and not the standard that you would find in a burger shop.  We tried the spinach and artichoke dip and tempura zucchini fries with our burgers and they were pretty good.  The burgers themselves were okay, the meat had chewy parts to it.  Environment:  It was louder than preferred, they had a DJ spinning some good beats.  It was a blend of a Fox Restaurant with Holsteins (Cosmopolitan LV), and an All Saints Retail store.  Overall, we will probably come back, but it won't be our go-to burger joint.  The food was decent for the price, but the service was pretty bad and fairly slow."}
{"text":"We live down the street and walked down to the water front and thought, why not try something new. We dropped in and sat at the bar. Brittany was our bar tender and she was great! We got the wings and Western Bacon burger and they both were phenomenal. Highly recommend this place and we will surly be back"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, portions are small.  The Black Angus Tomahawk was just enough for one person although they state it's 2lbs.  All the weight must be within the bone, so the $95 price is ridiculous for what you get. The cookie ice cream sandwich for dessert was disappointing. The cookies were so hard that I had to smash into it with a knife.  Hand crafted drinks were satisfying, and the atmosphere and service is great.  Perfect place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"UPDATE at bottom  This place is suppose to have really good burgers...well mine was just a little dry and not tasty enough. Simply overcooked when I asked for a medium.  All the burgers on the menu sound really good and interesting but it just wasn't cooked correctly.  The burgers are the price of most other places except this place doesn't give you a side i.e. fries. Maybe I just need to give this place a second chance but I don't know if I will since my burger didn't even come with a side..  UPDATE:  I went in for a second time just recently.  I originally rated this place 3 stars simply because I thought it was over priced for a over cooked burger.  Well I went in for a second time and I made sure to order quite a lot of different drinks and food items. I had a amazing experience that I had to update my review.  First of all, I ordered smoked salmon off of their appetizers and just because of them I will absolutely be a repeat customer from now on.  It was so fresh and good and a really big portion.  Salt and vinegar fries are a simple appetizer order but really good and sharing portion.  I got wings off of the appetizer menu as well and that also was generous in portion and it was a light rub and it was really good but I do personally like my wings smothered in sauce.  Still good and will order them again.    That was all the food we could handle because we happen to be there during happy hour so we ended up ordering lots of drinks one after another because we were so curious to try them. They all sounded really good and we got to try around 6+ different drinks and they were all interesting and good in their own way.  My very first drink however (The Gardener) was a little watery and I didn't like it so much but our server offered to switch it out which was awesome of her.  I do want to go back and try more food items and drinks. Until then, I will post some pictures of our most recent visit."}
{"text":"First off, potentially my favorite decor in the entire valley. The service was exceptional, our server Sophia was so knowledgeable of the menu and wine selection. Our table got the salt and vinegar fries (one of my favs) and also tried the truffle mashed potatoes and the sweet potato gratin, both were phenomenal. I ordered the veggie burger which was different than your average veggie burger, in the best way possible. Very flavorful with hints of sweetness. I have also had a few of their other burgers which are just as tasty! Oh... and the blackberry Mojito was like an adult snow cone. Couldn't be more perfect for a hot Arizona summer day!"}
{"text":"I went with my family for an afternoon lunch and was blown away by the service and selection of food!   I had golden beets with a light mozzarella, a beautiful jalapeño burger that was done just right and a side of asparagus that was absolutely wonderful   Love this place.  A new favorite for me"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. They literally took 15 mins before they even introduced themselves and asked for our drink order. That was after had politely asked the staff where our server was."}
{"text":"Burgers and sweet potato fries were awesome. Sara is great waitress and super polite and friendly. This place was an unexpected amazing place for dinner and drinks. Great area close to old town Scottsdale and entertainment. Will def eat here again."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and very friendly staff. I tried the jalapeño burger which wasn't too spicy but perfect and full of flavor. My boyfriend got the BBQ burger and really enjoyed it as well. The star of the meal was the salt and vinegar fries though...I loved them!! Onion rings are pretty good too but we only got 4 with a small order. I plan to eat here again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks....sat at bar because it was over an hour wait for a table.  Ordered cocktails and appetizers.  When we got to order dinner I had the bison chops...tasted fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here for reverse happy hour. Got a draft beer, which was supposed to be $3 a beer, according to their Instagram post and menu. Turned out to be coors only and a \"typo\" according to the manager. They didn't adjust the bill for their typo."}
{"text":"\"I don't like it if it don't gleam, gleam and to hell with the price cuz the money ain't a thang\". Classic hip-hop as I walk in and bass I can feel in my bones?  My my Hand Cut, aren't we off to a good start!   We were greeted by an enthusiastic server who's name started with a K. K. explained that all beef is grass fed and grass finished (no antibiotics or hormones) and they try to source everything at the local level. She knew the menu and was able to give suggestions with confidence.  Fantastic service!  We went with the following:  Salt & Vinegar Fries: they taste exactly how they sound, are garnished with fresh dill (love that), and served with a small side of house ranch...I could have used more ranch.  Macaroni Carbonara: the sunny side up egg on top makes this dish!    California Burger: How cute was this lil burg!  The portions are pretty small but at least there was some good flavor.  Highlights were the sprouts and pickled onions.  Mushroom Burger: this was the superior burger!!!  Add the egg.  It is totally worth it because Hand Cut's fried egg game is tight!  The mushrooms are roasted then drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  The arugula and roasted garlic mayo didn't hurt!  Last we were taken on a treat journey!  Chocolate Chip cookie with Salted Carmel Ice Cream: I am not sure how they pulled off intense salt flavor in their Salted Camel ice cream with out being offensively salty.  The salt flavor came first and was followed by sweet creaminess.  I would say it's some of the best salted caramel ice cream I have had.  The cookie was great too.  It was crunchy enough that it didn't fall apart but soft enough to stab with a spoon.  Overall, it was a great and entertaining meal!"}
{"text":"This place hands down is the best.. from drinks to appetizers!! The lobster Burger & ribeye and we won't even talk about how amazing desert was!!!"}
{"text":"I work on the Waterfront and I've been meaning to try this place since it opened. I called about 4 times to put in an order for pick up and no one answered the phone. I only have so long for my lunch breaks so calling food in early is a must. Haven't even tried the food yet, but unless they get better at answering phones I definitely won't be going any time soon."}
{"text":"really bad smell when walking in, not sure what that was.  Had really good salt n'vinegar fries.  asked for burger with no mayo...got mayo.  everyone else had good food and drinks."}
{"text":"The day bartender/ server was amazing. The wings were a bit too salty but everything else was great!! I would highly recommend the California burger."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after shopping at Nordstrom's since it's across the street. It was happy hour so I had a wine and a burger. It was decent. They weren't busy which was nice."}
{"text":"At first, I had one of the most iffy experiences ever at this place and nearly wrote them a one star review. Clearly, they redeemed themselves.   My boyfriend and I came here after finding them on Yelp, then we learned about their Tuesday half price meat cuts and HALF OFF BOTTLES OF WINE (YES).    Everything we ordered minus one steak was apparently for the table behind us so they removed it from our table then gave it to the table behind me (yes, I cringed a bit but they made up for it) Tons of mistakes were made, thus the wine was flowing. We expected a $105 tab and when it arrived we found out that they discounted the entire thing to $35. Quite the redemption and I'll definitely return because of it."}
{"text":"I have to say for a great,  grass fed, Arizona local real Beef burger dont even think about going anywhere else,  Hand Cut is my go to burger joint. When you first arrive the whole restaruant just feels alive,  it's open yet still cozy,  the kitchen and prep areas are also very visible from the seating area. This is particularly nice so you can really get a vibe for the employees,  the care and character of the food and the presentation.   We had great suggestions from our waitress on what to get, starter was Tempura Zucchini Fries (excellent not over fried), Western Burger (medium) ,  onion rings (perfect crunch with a soft and meaty inside) , my buddy had the Lobster Roll Burger,  which she will post a separate review (super yummy).   As we were waiting for our food to arrive Justin one of the owners, came to our table and told us he just passed by the window of the kitchen and saw our food and it was looking amazing,  he then went back and brought us our dinners.   Wow is the only way I can explain the table presentation and the first bite,  local organic,  grass fed,  sustainable Arizona beef is nothing short of amazing. The flavor was out of this world and unlike any burger I have had anywhere in the valley,  the BBQ sauce was unique and homemade and the roll was dynamite. All in all it was perfection to the last bite.    The must try dessert is the Butter Cake,  it is way better than the version at City Hall,  perfectly moist,  and sweet with a scoop of premium  ice cream on top.   I'd like to also add the rest of the staff at Hand Cut Burgers were, attentive, considerate,  and caring,  keeping up with my iced tea drinking problem very nicely.   Hand Cut Burgers, has now become my Favorite Arizona burger destination. Please guys don't change a thing."}
{"text":"This place has the best onion rings I've ever had & the mushroom burger & wedge salad were great too. Loved the atmosphere. Our waitress was a little slow, but the great food made up for it."}
{"text":"I do not eat meat so I can't be of help in the burger department, but the burgers do look scrumptious. My boyfriend who has tried every burger in America said its his favorite burger. I love their unique cocktail menu and atmosphere is really cool, sleek and modern. I am a huge whiskey fan and they have a nice display of them. The service is good and quick, even with busy old town Scottsdale crowds. They did mess up my order but was quick to give me a free meal at my next visit. They have really good veggies and sides. Def recommend if you are in the area... but NOT kid friendly and super loud inside."}
{"text":"I had not heard of this restaurant before, but it was featured on ABC 15's Smart Shopper for its \"Half Chop\" Tuesdays, which means that every Tuesday night after 6 p.m. You can order almost anything off the chops part of the menu for half price! Wines by the bottle are also half price! I was looking for somewhere new and fun to celebrate my son's 15th birthday, so I contacted the GM who was very helpful and we went last night for dinner.  This restaurant is located at the very trendy Waterfront at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Whoever did the interior design did a fantastic job...kind of Kelly Wearstler meets Philippe Starck for the design mavens out there . It definitely appealed to the designer in me.  Our server, Sarah was just fantastic! She was so sweet and knowledgeable . She recommended a great red blend called Motto Gung Ho, and I was able to order the bottle at $14.  I ordered the filet MR+ and added blue cheese crumbles. It was one of the most tender cuts I've had,  and perfectly prepared! Dishes are served a la  carte, and I ordered roasted cauliflower in a Parmesan cream sauce to accompany my steak.  My son had the roast chicken breast with the macaroni carbonara, and he was not disappointed! We had dessert too...a homemade chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich and the butter cake  with salted Carmel and roasted peaches. So yummy! We had another great server, Kylie, who opened the wine and let us know about the burger and drink special for $10 each weekday until 3:00.  I will definitely be returning to try out the burgers, which are all grass fed beef btw."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Sheryl Crow - The First Cut Is The Deepest)  I would have given you all of my stars But there's something that's torn me apart And it's singing songs when I Yelp But if you want I'll try to love you again Chophouse, I'll try to love again, but you know....  At Handcut ... Burger & Chophouse Burgers you know At Handcut ... Burger & Chophouse And when it comes to onion rings, it's crisp When it comes to french fries, it's dilled   I stopped by here for a Sunday Brunch with my family.  They were very accommodating and helpful with the seating and the service was very good.  The place is open like a farm to table atmosphere with some jamming music.  Everyone seemed so hip....man I'm old!  I wanted to try their burgers so bad, but I didn't feel like eating a full one by myself and didn't want to take any home.  So I went with the Hanger Steak instead.  My family and I all shared their Salt & Vinegar Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, Onion Rings, and Macaroni and Cheese.  Overall, I really enjoyed their creativity with the fries which also came along with dill and dill ranch dip.  My favorite bite was probably the onion rings which was extra crisp with a hard crunchy breading which helped contain the warm bite every time!  I didn't care much for the sweet potato fries since...it is what it is and the mac and cheese was supposed to come with lobster, but didn't get much of that at all; again love the creativity here!  My hanger steak was okay.  I wanted it medium rare, but only the middle cut was at the right temperature while the two tips were well done.  It came along with a creamy butter atop, but that only covered the middle section of my steak;  I was totally craving for that butter haha!  It really helped make the steak pop for me, but there only morsels of it!    In the end, I rather enjoyed my visit to this place, but I need to shoot for what I want next time I guess.  I heard their burgers were bomb so until next time! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had a perfect dinner with my honey on the patio.  Great service to match the food.  Enjoyed the salt and dill fries, wedge salad and bone in strip.  Filled up so no room for desert.  We shall be returning soon."}
{"text":"We came in for drinks on a Saturday at 4:00. The place was dead. I understand why now... The decor is nice and it's in a great location, but the service was awful!!! The bartenders were more interested in chatting with each other than paying attention to their customers. I ordered a reisling and the girl said they were out, she didn't offer any other options/suggestions. So I ordered a beer but my husband needed a minute to decide. It was about 5 minutes before she came back to ask what he wanted. Another group at at the bar and she didn't greet them she just threw menus at them and walked away. She proceeded to talk to her co-worker, and didn't check back with us for about 20min. Skip this place and head to Olive & Ivy! Their service is great and they're always busy. It's also not as douchey."}
{"text":"This is a very cool place to grab a burger, or for that matter, a serving of any type of red meat.  While they do have salads, the menu leans towards burgers, chops and steaks.  My visit here over the weekend was very fun.  The decor and music is upscale, hip and trendy.  Kind of like a steakhouse meets a nightclub or lounge.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed the chopped salad, crispy baked chicken wings and the hand cut classic burger.  All were very good but I definietly want to come back and try their steaks.  The bartenders were very friendly and made great cocktails.  My Manhattan and my friend's Sazerac were excellent."}
{"text":"My daughter said it best- \"It's decent\". The food is fine, the service- not so great. After reading another review of this place, we found the same experience. Staff spends most of their time on their phones and huddled in the back talking. We felt quite abandoned and the place was empty when we were there.  My burger was good, but not worth the aggravation. Also, the menu suffers from an identity crisis. Is this a burger place, steak and seafood place??  And to top it off, there was no gluten free buns for my daughter who suffers from an allergy."}
{"text":"Had lunch here this weekend. Excellent burgers. The flavor was outstanding and the tempura zucchini fries a must. I had the wedge salad with chicken it also was very good . They used romain lettuce wedges . Wait staff was very attentive. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This s*** is bananas martini is the bomb.com!!! Full review pending actually having dinner here but couldn't resist sharing this adorable cocktail win."}
{"text":"Wow!  Awesome food! Great service and reasonably priced.  The dessert was amazing too. Atmosphere is fun and not too loud even when full. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great meal, cool atmosphere!  Loved the filet & added lobster claw w truffle. It was rich & flavorful. Smoked salmon toast with the pickled red onions was a huge portion so perfect to share. Highly recommend the Bugey-Cerdon bubbles! My new fave. Husband had the classic burger & he loved it. Awesome new place. Can't wait to go back & try more menu items."}
{"text":"My wife and I met our friends here for dinner. They atmosphere is nice, music a little loud but not conversation stopping. My wife and I are not big eaters so we split most of the time. We got the chopped salad and they were nice enough to split it for us onto two smaller plates which I told our waitress. Most places won't do that. The salad was the bomb. The goat cheese with the blueberry balsamic was amazing, We also got the sweet potato gratin and it to was very good. Our friends got the bacon mac and cheese and the western bacon burger and they were pleased with those two also. Here's where it goes south. We shared the 12 oz ribeye for $36.00 thinking it had to be good. It wasn't. Very tough to chew and over 1/4  or more of the steak was solid fat. Now marbling is what gives the ribeye it's flavor but this was solid fat. So between the fat and what we took out of our mouths because we could'nt get through it..I know, gross, half the steak was on our plate. My friend said to say something to the waitress but I don't like doing that because our son is a server and people take advantage of you just for a freebie. When the waitress came to the table I thought better of it and when she asked how it was I said it was a little tough and fatty as she could obviously see from our plate. I added that I didn't want anything off the bill just wanted them to be aware. She looked at me and didn't say a word. Didn't think anything of it until she walked past the table and dropped a single check on it and kept walking. I told my friends I think she's annoyed. We got her attention the next time she walked by and said we'd like another round of drinks and we weren't finished eating and also when we were done could she split the check by couples. She got our drinks and split the checks and walked away again. The next few times we needed her we had to send a busboy or another server to get her. Lot's of attitude and needs to be trained on handling these types of scenarios. I still tipped her 20%."}
{"text":"The decor and vibe of the restaurant in my opinion is very unique and super cool. The service has been slightly inconsistent but maybe that's because they're new and working it out? Everyone that works there has been extremely nice and has great customer service skills when they're talking to you. However, it's been a little slow. The smoked salmon appetizer is simply delicious. In my opinion the flavors balance very well and is the perfect snack or lunch. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"M and I came there for a Friday night dinner.  They place was 1/4 full, but the wait was 20 mins for a table but the bar was open.  So we got our spots at the bar, we were greeted quickly and our drinks appeared like magic.  They need to install those purse hanging thingy to the bar, so you can put your purse somewhere.  We got: 1.  Spinach & artichoke dip - It was pretty good and the toasted ciabatta were good accompanies. 2.  Salt & vinegar fries - OK, these are to die for. Crispy and the fresh dill was a good touch.  House ranch was delicious.   3.  Hand cut classic burger - I have to say one of the best burgers I had in awhile.  Juice, taste like beef, flavors are all there, cooked to perfection, and the buns were soft.    We were well taken care of from the three staff members at the bar, never had to ask for more refills.  I need to come back for some steak!"}
{"text":"Shockingly one of the BEST burgers I've had in AZ! The atmosphere was great for a date night and/or a night out with the girls."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to rate a place as one star. This joint qualifies.  This was my second visit here and the experiences quite similar.  Both times (~ 6pm for dinner) it took 40 minutes for the food to arrive.  This last visit a few days ago, not only did the food arrive late as usual, but 3 out of 3 \"medium rare\" grass fed burger patties were visibly burnt on both sides and very dry overall. I'd say they were cooked Well++.  2 of the burger buns were crushed. The manager and server seemed surprised that it would arrive so crushed, but that was a fake response. I know why, I just didn't tell them I saw what happened - one of the lamps they use to keep your food warm while they figure out their mess in the kitchen fell on the burgers and left a dent along the outer line of the lamp base.  We also ordered chicken wings. They were also very dry and sat there for a long time before delivered to our table.  We were short on time and opted to just stay and nibble at this food. The kids did not finish their meals.  The manager was sympathetic and took 15% off the bill. Any manager that knows what they're doing would have immediately comp'd the entire meal. This was crappy food that should have NEVER left the kitchen on its way to a patron. Who knows what else they mess up that we can't immediately tell visually.  This place can not be trusted. This place is hyped up but does not live up to it, not even close."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I can't wait to go back! Food was amazing and a very nice rustic decor!"}
{"text":"Good food. The burger was really good Great happy hour before 6 you get a beer and burger for $10 and half price on alot of other items. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"If all you want is cheap happy hour food with inexpensive wine or a good beer, this could be your place. If you have ever been to Morton's or Ruth Chris you will be VERY disappointed. Average to below average on taste, service, and selection. Onion rings reminded me of the ones you buy in a box, keep in the freezer, and reheat on a cookie sheet. Could be a great place in a great location but then it would need to improve on almost everything. It's not very full, even at peak times, and there's a reason. Save your money or pick from one of the many other neighborhood choices."}
{"text":"Great place with good ambiance and doesn't get crazy busy like other restaurants in the area. Had the 12 oz. Porterhouse with Blue cheese crumbles on it. Seriously one of the better steaks I have had in a while. My wife had the Filet with garlic butter and she loved it. Cook temps were spot on and the staff was great."}
{"text":"Food on par with food in the area, but terrible service; drinks, and only appetizers for a small group took about two hours just a heads up! Plenty other options in area"}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful atmosphere and is very updated and modern in decor. The wait staff was very friendly and had great suggestions on what to order and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu items.   For appetizer we had wings and the salt and vinegar fries. They looked so good I forgot to take a picture before diving in! They were delicious!!   For lunch I had the wedge salad which was absolutely delicious. My mom had the chopped salad which she loved, and my sister had the crispy chicken sandwich which she loved as well. We received both our appetizers and entrees very quickly and were seated immediately upon arrival.    As for my meal, There isn't anything I would change about my salad! I ate every bite!   We will definitely be back to eat here again! I loved the atmosphere and the food choices, and the customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Whoa! A first for me! 2x at the same restaurant in 91.5 hours (won't make it a habit due to a 26 mile drive across Phoenix). :o  I started with a Blackberry Mojito and Tempura Zucchini Fries (yummy).  However, I was a bit disappointed for a bit, as I went here for the Fillet Mignon. But, was given a lunch menu. Luckily, when I asked my waitress if I could order off the dinner menu, she said no problem. :)  So, I ordered that, medium rare, of course, with garlic mushrooms and grilled asparagus.  The meal was superb. Everything arrived hot. The fillet practically melted in my mouth.   The service wasn't quite at the level that I had on the first visit. But, it was still great service.  I'll be back. I just wish I lived closer to them."}
{"text":"First of all, talk about amazing service! Every single Time I come service is on point. Food is excellent and you will Want to definitely take advantage of the lunch specials.. smoking deals for 10$ And let's not forget they have these charging book Things that were offered to me by a bartender when I was searching for an outlet to plug my phone in!! I'm in love with this place"}
{"text":"Amazing! one of my new favorite places to go! They do a great happy hour, and the appetizers are perfect! I especially like the salmon!"}
{"text":"This has been the slowest, worst experience I have had at a restaurant in a long time. We got here at 1:30 to eat lunch before our 3:00 appointment, but got 3 plates of incorrect food (we have food allergies) at 2:45. It is not busy in here. There is no excuse for this. I will never eat here again.   Edit: the staff did comp our meal, and I had an email exchange with someone in response to this review (assuming owner or manager?). The staff did do their best to handle the situation after it had happened, and the owner/ manager did have genuine interest in making the situation better."}
{"text":"Let's start from the top. Great atmosphere, great service staff. The Mac & Cheese is to do for, if you don't get it you'll miss out!  We had a burger which went over well with the crowd. The ribeye, overpriced, but a ribeye; was cooked perfectly to a Med rare, had little to no flavor. I added sly and pepper and it was better.  All in all,  happy hour was great with Mac & Cheese, a burger and $3 beers. But don't kid yourself and expect a high quality steak.."}
{"text":"Go straight to the bar and have Matt fix you some amazing cocktails, will be best decision you make ."}
{"text":"First time here and what a great date night hang out complete with crafty cocktails and a DJ to keep the vibe alive. THE BEST BURRATA EVER! Seriously a must try if you love beets and arugula and burrata of course. The veal chop was also a favorite so rich and tender. Seared to perfection on the outside and a beautiful medium rare on the inside juicy good!  The deconstructed wedge salad had me worried but the creamy blue cheese, tart apples and meaty bacon were classic wedge wowza!  Hubby's yelp check in got us a free order of salt and vinegar fries yum! The truffle butter mashed potatoes tho! Omg! The evening ended with a salted Carmel butter cake with roasted peaches and vanilla bean ice cream. Yup.  Atmosphere 5, service 5 and food super 5!"}
{"text":"So I live right next store, Hopi g for another great walk to options. Forget it, here tonight hostess with a snotty attitude, place is empty plenty of empty tables, bar is empty.... server sweet girl. Watched table next to us(party of 4) can't even serve 4 burgers at the same time. This place will never make it. Small entries, everything ala carte..... at a burger joint. Forget it if you want a great burger go down the street to Deluxe"}
{"text":"Overall, a good experience. The atmosphere was great, and the staff was attentive and friendly. I had the tempura chicken sandwich and switched the peach slaw for the jalapeño slaw. So glad I did because it was so spicy and delicious. My husband had the western bacon burger and it was just average (not great, not bad, just average). We ordered the vinegar fries and the pasta with fried egg as our side dishes, and both were good."}
{"text":"Had a really great lunch experience this afternoon. Arrived around 1130 am and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too busy. Our hostess and waitress, Naomi, was very friendly and accommodated seating the stroller we had with us. We had a couple burgers that's were delish, a side salad and the salt and vinegar fries. The side salad could have had some more cucumbers or other veggies, but was still good. Also, I needed to eat dairy free and Naomi asked the kitchen to ensure everything was ok for me to eat. Great ambiance and service!"}
{"text":"They were crazy busy so service was a little suspect, they more than made up for it though as things calmed down. Food was amazing, going back for sure. Love me a gourmet burger!"}
{"text":"I ordered the California Burger (burger done medium, avocado, Swiss cheese, sprouts, pickled red onions and herb aioli, topped with crisp sweet potato strings) and Salt & Vinegar Fries with Dill Ranch fry sauce. DELICIOUS.  The vinegar fries with dill ranch were a revelation, and the burger was well-balanced and a treat to eat. I highly recommend these items!   When you go, tell them Joshua S. sent you! You'll get a confused look."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Over cooked. Limited selection of food, beer, and wine.   Took a long time to get our drinks initially. Everyone at my tables had their burgers or steaks over cooked by at least two levels. I would not suggest this place in the future."}
{"text":"Incredible selection! Didn't have anything off the menu that wasn't simply incredible! Hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"My husband enjoyed his burger. My roasted chicken was the best I've ever had. So much flavor. Same with the Brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and consistent service. Went with coworkers for a lunch and they were quick and the food was not only tasty, but at a good price point."}
{"text":"Just randomly chose to go here one night with a friend. The ambience in the restaurant is so cute. We thought the food was fantastic and if you check in, you get a free plate of salt and vinegar fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for an early dinner and loved it! The decor and vibe of the restaurant was really different than most places I've been to which is what initially made the experience a good one. I got the 8 oz steak and then we got grilled asparagus and truffle mashed potatoes for the table to share. Everything was delicious, the server was great, and an amazing location. I would recommend Hand Cut to family and friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks, atmosphere and service. Best ranch dressing and fries with vinegar/fresh dill I've ever had. The lobster on the burger was the best and the wings were equally as perfect and unique. Excellent quality ingredients, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place out on Friday. It has the vibe of going out without really going out. They have awesome music, the atmosphere is really trendy and fun, and it has a nice modern feel to it. Their menu is great, and has some vegetarian options. They have a happy hour, too. The food was so delicious. We got a variety of sides to split. The only thing that took away from it was the slower service. It was Friday and busy, but we had to ask our waitress multiple times to get our water."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great.  We called on short notice with a party of 10 and they were able to accommodate. We shared the sweet potato fries and salt & vinegar fries.  Both were delicious.  I got the jalapeño burger and it was just right."}
{"text":"Great new place! Miranda was our server and she was very friendly and knowledgeable. We started with the tempura zucchini and the salmon appetizers. It was happy hour so they were on special. Very good! I had salmon for dinner and my husband chose the Western Burger. Both were very fresh and tasted fantastic. Don't miss the macaroni and cheese! Checking out dessert for next time!"}
{"text":"I came here with my daughter to have dinner and spend some time together, I had ordered the filet mignon and it wasn't quiet right , the manager Jessie insisted that I get the steak that I want and went out of her way to make sure I did . Even though it took several tries to get it right I appreciated the fact that she cared . I may not have gotten the best meal but the service was priceless , I believe that the food is good on its own merits but the customer service was something that means a lot when going out and you  want to have an enjoyable evening . Thank you again Jessie for taking the time to care how my experience was at your restaurant. We plan to come back again when I return in October to try the porkchops !!"}
{"text":"Had the spinach artichoke dip with bruschetta, which I'd highly recommend. Also tried the chicken melt which was also great. The fries I give an A+. Overall healthy and good variety of food. Would recommend for others to try."}
{"text":"Food and service was great menu is short. The only complaint is the water tastes like tap water."}
{"text":"My brother came here a few weeks ago and recommended we go. I was really excited to try this place out! We were told there was a wait time of 25 minutes. Well 50 minutes later after we saw two groups of people leave after going up to the hostess desk to ask how much longer, we decided to wait a little bit longer before going up to ask how much longer. 10 minutes later, I went up to ask how much longer. Was told 15 minutes, I asked if that is a legit 15 minutes as we were told originally 25 minutes. I was advised the owner told them to tell everyone there is 25 minute wait regardless of how long it will actually be. I asked where the owner was, well he was enjoying dinner with his family. Sat down another 10 minutes as and then we decided to go somewhere else. We went up to tell them and I asked to speak to a manager. 10 minutes later, no manager. I told the hostess I was tired of waiting for a table, tired of waiting for a manger, just tired of waiting for some type of service. My money will be spent elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 of their steak salads through Postmates cause the way it was presented online sounded amazing. Arugula, avocados  and steak mmmm.   Got the salads. All Romain Lettuce. No avocado. And two small pieces (slices) of steak.   Definitely not worth 16$  Burgers may be good. But salads are not worth the cost."}
{"text":"My steak was over and worse our server never checked back until after I had to flag someone down to get the manager.  Gets three stars because the manager was gracious and took care of the problem as best she could, given that we were done eating by this point.  I recognize that it server was busy but she really really should have checked back."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my BFF and the baby and we had the best server ever by the name of Leah! We got to sit outside and people watch as well as eat amazing food. We shared the pomegranate blueberry salad that was phenomenal as well as well as amazing French fries! Great spot if you like people watching and good food and good vibes :-) thanks Leah!"}
{"text":"The attention to detail for this place is impeccable.  You can tell the owner sat in every nook and cranny and made sure that it had something artistic to offer.   The atmosphere was cool, with dim lights and a DJ playing some 80's hip hop.    The food was great and service was exemplary.  Sarah, our waitress, was especially bright and kind and treated us like royalty. (My only critique was that the Jalapeños on my burger were weak, but it's Scottsdale and I am Hispanic, so whatevs.)"}
{"text":"I'm a foodie, so don't judge me when I order 12 things at a new restaurant. I did just that and pretty much every single item was superb. I told our server the chicken wings were the best I have ever had, and I've had more than my fair share. And I meant it. The burger and flat iron steak were standouts. I give the ambiance and DJ 10 stars. If you don't order the Mac N cheese, we probably can't be friends.... and it's even better with the salt and vinegar fries. Addicting and can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"This review is only for the drinks - we stopped in here for some pre-dinner drinks and I was pleasantly surprised by the College Street Big Blue Van. This local brew really had a great balance of vanilla and blueberry while maintaining it's wheat identity.  The ambiance of this place, however, is quite puzzling. It's like it can't decide if it wants to be upscale, hipster or just plain out there. It has multiple different floorings, including faux grass, some gaudy gold light fixtures and green ceiling paint, but then booth cushions that look like a big blanket is draped over each one. Still perplexed, but would still stop in for some additional brews and maybe some apps."}
{"text":"I had a great time here. We had the chicken wings, spinach dip and vinegar fries as appetizers. They were great and service was fast and friendly.  I was with two buddies and we were just going to grab a quick bite and a couple of drinks before we headed out for the evening. So we decided to have the 'Tomahawk' steak entree sliced and shared. Great choice.  After a few cocktails we passed on desert and were on our way... I would have to say that the experience was flawless.  It's exactly what I wanted in a steak house, this place nailed a fun atmosphere and great food without the pretentiousness of the other steak and burger options in old town. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We stopped in for their $10 meal deal... includes a burger, fries and a drink.  Their menu is absolutely AMAZING!!!  The freshest of ingredients are used (and it's noticeable) to make their culinary delights!  They also have many unique items on their menu.  Their fries are awesome... so are their onion rings!  The inside is very eclectic with a DJ booth and interesting decorations all over.  The door handles to get in are pretty cool too!    We really enjoyed everything about this place, including the service!  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to go here for a bite to eat and some good drinks! We usually sit at the bar, and their staff is always super pleasant and attentive. We've had almost every burger on the menu at this point, but honestly my absolute favorite is their original burger. Their beef is hand packed and super fresh, as are their toppings and buns. We also love their sweet potato fries & their salt & vinegar fries! One single serving for two people is PLENTY as the portion is pretty hardy. Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is a must if you are in the Oldtown Scottsdale area! The atmosphere is trendy and fun but you can still hear yourself and have conversation with the people around you! The Zucchini fries and truffled mash potatoes are out of this world! Their house Cab- Drumheller is unreal, I started with one glass and we ended up ordering a bottle for the table! Great service you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I had the privilege of attending the friends and family VIP night at this incredible venue! A+ food, atmosphere, and service! I would highly recommend you checking it out for dinner drinks or an ice cream sandwich dessert . Very unique place!"}
{"text":"First and foremost this review is for lunch offerings only....  Decor and vibe of place is 5 star all day long.  The display/prep kitchen was very interesting concept.   Sat at bar for lunch with friend.   Ordered smoked blue cheese burger and buddy the crispy chicken sandwich and split.  Sandwich lacked seasoning...  The amount of beef on burger seemed meager.  Flavor was decent.  Ordered Medium Rare, came out over.  I can get over that.  Ordered Salt/Vinegar fries and Ranch Onion Rings....  Watched my fries sit on the pass through for about 6 minutes.  When they arrived, cold.... Sent back (if your going to indulge the calories.... they must be hot) when they came back....  just regular fries  (but hot).  Not a MUST for the burger options, but will give one more try for the Chophouse component at nighttime."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best burger I've ever had. My husband and I came here on a whim; we just walked by and decided to go in (we almost passed it!). I salt literally EVERYTHING and my husband puts ketchup on everything. We didn't use ketchup OR salt on our burgers and fries. That's the first time I've ever not salted a burger or fries. Seriously! Best burger and fries anywhere. Nicole was our server and she was friendly and helpful too."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food, ambiance and service.  Make sure you hit Handcut in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We were told it would be a 25 minute wait, which became a 1 hour wait even with 3 parties ahead of us leaving since they didn't want to wait any longer. Then they were telling people it'd be a 45 minute wait for the food alone. We found out the owner told his staff to tell everyone coming through the door that it'd be a 25 minute wait while at the same time he was sitting with his family eating and not giving a care in the world. I came here with my brother and talked it up to be a great place but now I'm embarrassed. Basic customer service, courtesy, and math skills are NOT required to own or manage this place. I'll be sure to spread the word."}
{"text":"First time here and was blown away. The service from the helpful hostess, to the knowledgeable bartender was fantastic. Ordered the chicken sandwich and was not disappointed, so much flavor and the chipotle mayo was a success!   Will absolutely return for the \"cookie dough bread pudding\".   5/5"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD the mushroom cheddar burger is amazing. First time here and I'll be back a lot. I'm not even a huge burger person but loved it. The vinegar fries are amazing and the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Dropped by this place after some shopping.  Interesting decor and very lively, friendly place.  Enjoyed some tempura zucchini fries and a chop salad with a blueberry vinaigrette.  Service was very attentive.  A definite revisit when I'm back in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Would rather give no stars... made a reservation for 545pm for 6 people.  Tried to sit us at a booth for 4... the excuse was priceless....the designers made it that way!  Wait, it gets better.... the restaurant was not even half full and they refused to move us. Bye!  There are too many other choices!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue! Matt took care of us for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago and it was fabulous! He hooked it up with shots and our server was also amazing and very attentive. I had been there before and chose to go there for my birthday because of the fun atmosphere and good food/drinks. Def a good spot in old town to start your night"}
{"text":"Western burger, plain fries, Mac n Cheese, ice cream sandwich... Delicious. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! The half off steak and bottles of wine on Tuesday nights is incredible. I will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"I'm thrilled to have this great new restaurant in Old Town!  I had dinner with 2 friends last night.  First of all, I loved the eclectic decor--so much fun!  Second, our service was great.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  I had to send a drink back because I hadn't realized when I ordered it that it had bitters in it, which I hate.  I never do that, but I absolutely couldn't stomach it.  The server was very nice about it and even kept apologizing, even though it was my fault rather than hers.  Last, but definitely not least, the food was fantastic!!  We shared the carbonara and cauliflower apps.  The one complaint was that the servings were small for being \"to share\", but the flavors were great.  Then I had the classic burger--cooked to perfection, juicy, and a good bun.  And it was a perfect size, not of those giant burgers that you can't fit in your mouth.  My friends had 2 of the other burgers and loved them.  The fries were great too!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First thing you notice: all the super attractive girls working there! Jeez Louise I felt like I needed to get myself to the gym and get my makeup done.  Needless to say, this place provides great service. 3 stars because the food was a-okay..... I ordered a jalapeño grass fed burger that really lacked flavor. I had to ask for  a side of ranch to give it an extra kick. Probably should have ordered the California burger instead. The wings were my favorite out of all the food choices we got including artichoke dip and salt & vinegar fries.  The drinks were all pretty crafty and unique but next time I'll play it safe and order wine. 1/2 off bottles on Tuesday and you can take them to go!  Lastly, the decor is what brought me inside in the first place. The cute sheep statues and trees manicured into the shapes of bears is sooo adorable. Not sure if I'd return as there are many delicious places to try in Scottsdale but would recommend others give it a chance."}
{"text":"The Atmosphere/Ambiance is actually a 5 star rating for me.   The food, while it tastes good is over priced for the portion size they serve.  For instance, I was going to order a burger yet when I saw the servers bringing them out, all I saw was a huge bun and a tiny patty inside.  We went with a salad and Short Rib Sandwich.  There was maybe 6 ozs at most on the sandwich.  Had great flavor though.  We also ordered the Mac n Cheese side.  This portion was actually not bad and it too tasted really good.    As this is owned by FRC, the drink size/quality is not the same as their other restaurants (i.e Olive and Ivy).    We spent $80 with tip (had a couple of cocktails) and walked out of the restaurant very hungry still.  As much as we would like to return, due to portion size for the higher price, I will probably choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hand * Cut Burgers and Chophouse is amazing! It's an cool modern twist to your favorite burgers and steak house. All in one salads, burgers and steak, all very yum I might add! They come the wonderful staff that created el hefe, whiskey row, and farm and craft in old town Scottsdale. I went to check it out on the week day, not a lot of people, middle of the day, staff was very friendly and attentive! When you walk in it's like your in a lounge but a cool lounge with vintage and colorful decor! I love it, it makes it what it is, which is cool, hip and can be enjoyed for all ages. Wide selection for their full bar, they even have a cool ice cream parlor for desserts. Lots of seating for inside, bar and even cool prop seating to the the Scottsdale fashion square mall, and people watching. Let's talk about the eats, I ordered the Jalapeño Ranch burger really superb, loved how it was spicy but not spicy where I needed water, it was a tasty spice! Which I really loved and I think they mastered. Everything is a la carte but I don't think you'll have a sad wallet After your meal. Everything is fairly affordable and you'll walk out the place a happy and satisfied customer. I also shared the sweet potato and Brussels sprouts, ugh delicious I love sweet potatoes and BS tho! Definitely wanna go for happy hour, it looks like they have such a wide and cool cocktail menu! Oh btw everything is made in house, and local produce way to go! Well Phoenix come through and eat a burger, stay hungry!"}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in Scottsdale  I'm not supposed to eat beef more than once a week. So the first time I came here, because my husband really wanted a burger, I was ready for disappointment. But they have the BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH I have ever had. The peach slaw on it is to die for. Die.   We've since been back when I wanted a burger and it's basically perfect. The happy hour is great. The drinks have really neat looking ice cubes with fruit in them- long rectangular ones, spheres- very cool looking. And the decor is so amazing. I'm a designer and I had to ask who did their interior decor, that's how good it is.   I've had the steak, too, but honestly... it's not as good as the burgers. My one sour note is the veggie burger. I thought, since they had such a great chicken sandwich, I could bring my vegetarian friend and his hamburger loving wife here. He said the veggie burger was awful, but the zucchini fries and regular fries were so good he didn't care so much.   Impress a date. With hamburgers."}
{"text":"Service is always five stars, very cool and open vibe at the bar or at a table..no stuffy dining room happening here. I love the burgers, always get it without the bun and never miss it. The Asparagus is always perfectly charred and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Obviously a great location. The decor and set up is cool. I had the fried chicken sandwich with peach coleslaw and it was absolutely amazing. I'm in love. I also had the salt and vinegar fries which were good too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in here on a whim. We were mostly drawn in by the odd mismatched decor and short wait time. Once we got in and ordered drinks (house made lemonade and vanilla soda), we noticed that both tasted very weird. The lemonade was so unbearably sour, and the vanilla soda was watery. Our server disappeared for 10-20 minutes at a time, and upon ordering from their very limited menu, we were very underwhelmed with the food. She ordered a burger, and I ordered a salad. The server offered to put a veggie patty in the salad, but said nothing about the price, and there was no indication on the menu. When we got our receipt (which wasn't split) there wasn't even a proper line item to charge me FOUR dollars for the patty.  We had no clue what \"food $ amount\" as an item on the receipt even meant and had to track down the server to find that there was in fact a hefty charge for the bland, seemingly microwaved \"veggie patty.\" The servers were all kind of absent, and dressed in very casual clothing with bralettes and belly buttons hanging out everywhere. It was very difficult to pick them out from the customers and they were very inattentive. Between the two of us we spent $50 to feel ripped off and disappointed."}
{"text":"I've had Hand Cut Burgers bookmarked for awhile. Came here on a Thursday night.   As I walk in my first thought is very trendy and modern looking bar. Has nice big booths and tables with the bar in the middle. Tv's above the bar and everyone watching Thursday Night football. I would say that the place is pretty loud with a lot of energy in the place.   We started out with the free salt & vinegar fries with a Yelp check-in and tempura Zucchini fries. Really good but everyone thought the zucchini fries were the best. Thick cuts of zucchini that was cooked perfectly. Soft in the middle and very tasty. The salt & vinegar fries were good too. I would say they were medium sized and nice and firm. Just how I like it. So I was a happy.   I had the mushroom cheddar burger with an egg on top. The burger was good. Ok I guess. The bun was nice a firm. Burger was cooked perfectly. Nothing special. I would say good not great.   My wife ordered the chicken melt sandwich. Didn't try it but she said it was good. She only ate half and took the rest home. She didn't complain and that's good. Both my daughter and son got the California burger. They ate it all. Didn't complain. So I guess it was good. My son been here a few times so he does enjoy this place.   Service was pretty good. Our server was nice and friendly. Since this was our first time here, she explained their menu to us. She was pretty busy but still was able to fill up our water glasses. Only problem was that the kitchen was very slow. Took awhile for our fries to come out. It even longer for our burgers. We actually finished all our fries before our burgers came out.   So overall I really liked the ambiance. Loud, modern, trendy, somewhat hip, and relaxing. Friendly service with good food. Not great but good. Had better burgers but it's the experience. We enjoyed it. Hope you do too."}
{"text":"Loud hipster DJ inside took away one star from a great dinner. Great food, reasonable prices for Scottsdale. Good looking bar menu with the exception of the beer list which was pretty boring.  Only two local beers, Sonora White Chocolate and San Tan Moon juice. They could really bump up the craft beer list quite easily.  Food was on the spicy side but that suited us just fine."}
{"text":"It's a hip cute place but the menu is limited and just underwhelming. I do like that you can upgrade your burger to a grass fed burger but really nothing jumps out on this menu as exciting. If the menu offered more variety I'd give this place another try.  The salt and vinegar fries taste fake like the seasoning is a powder and something that would be used on Lays potato chips. They are just too overpowering and the powder texture is funky on the palette.   Burgers lack creativity and just overall menu lacks zest and excitement. The decor and layout of this restaurant is  aesthetically pleasing but the menu doesn't reflect that feel or vision. Drinks were ok but nothing stands out food or drink wise  Very friendly service great location Lux design and layout but menu needs an overhaul."}
{"text":"Happy hour food portions and taste where on spot but beer happy hour selection sucks \"Coors & Coors lite\" really that's the only choice? Please rethink this because you can't say beer happy hour with one beer it's like saying happy hour cocktails and having one choice of cocktail. I will be coming back sometime soon and hope to see more beers on happy hour."}
{"text":"I came here with my family after finding a great cash back deal on Groupon and it was so worth it. The  service was outstanding and the food was well prepared presented and delicious The staff and management was very intent and courteous . Overall a 5 star review and a definite recommendation for all who come here after me."}
{"text":"It's great that they have humanely raised beef with non GMO feed, no antibiotics but they proudly display Crisco on their prep room shelves.      It's quite laughable.     Perhaps the should understand the food revolution before claiming they are fighting for it."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and fell in love! I had the classic burger, sweet potato with Brussel sprouts, and the salt and vinegar fries. Every bite was perfect. My only complaint is that it's so far from where I live because I would go all the time if it were closer! Also it's super cute inside, so happy they just opened:)"}
{"text":"This place was great! We were greeted in a fun way by the bar manager, Matt, the service from Janessa was awesome, and the food was amazing. Such a trendy new spot. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere & the staff was very friendly!! My veggie burger was ok next time I'll order something else. The Brussels & sweet potatoes were very good!"}
{"text":"5 stars Plus & many more. The Happy Hour food is amazing.Burgers is made of midwestern real Beef, steak salad, sides & appetizers are out of this world.  The servers are Outstanding,Brandon,Jesse,Nathan are out of this world. No Babies & Kids are to come here at all.  Enjoy the RomanticAmbiance"}
{"text":"Have heard great things about this place considering I only eat grass fed meat. I was pretty disappointed and so was everyone at our table. We all ordered our burgers specific temperatures and none of us got what we ordered. It's just frustrating because again, we pay a lot of money for unsatisfactory food. The ambiance was great service wasn't horrible. Their drink menu looked really new and interesting, though we didn't try any. We did order a glass of wine that was the smallest portion and definitely not 6 ounces. Hopefully after some time of being open things will change. And for all you gluten free eaters, this isn't your burger joint."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch. Fun, eclectic vibe. Our server was very bubbly and upbeat. My husband had the western burger with bacon, BBQ sauce, and cheese, and it was phenomenal. I took a bite and somewhat regretted not ordering it myself. Delicious brioche bun and meat was cooked well. He ordered a side of fries; they were a bit too salty for my liking. I had the chop salad which was a somewhat unusual mix of ingredients; pine nuts, blueberries, kale, goat cheese, blueberry vinaigrette. It was fresh tasting and light, which was what I was in the mood for. Would most likely try something else if we went back as meat is clearly their specialy"}
{"text":"Fun place!  Really cool decor.  We had a late lunch.  Service was fabulous!  Beware of the outdoor green chairs, they are not cushy!"}
{"text":"First time going.  Probably the best burger I've had in Scottsdale  since I moved here 2 years ago.  Amazing service.  Accidentally ordered the wrong burger.  They sent me a new one pronto, let us keep the wrongly ordered burger and didnt charge us for either.  And...They know how to do sweet potato fries!  Worth it.  Make a reservation though."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ambiance, wait staff, hostess and food.  Fun, upbeat restaurant setting across from Fashion Square. Menu is a mix of sandwiches/burgers and steaks. Love the side options. So many to choose from - from salt & vinegar handcut fries to lobster mac and grilled asparagus with lemon drizzle.   The tempura zucchini are quite \"meaty\" with a tasty, light batter. The S&V fries could have been soaked a little more in water (to remove excess starch) and also dried completely before frying - they were a little limp and could have been crispier. The burgers were very flavorful, the buns were light and airy, but substantial enough to house a burger patty. The meat itself was a bit too \"mushy\" and could have benefited from that grill char taste.  Flavors all-around were great!  Great for large and small groups. 2 burgers, 2 beers, 1 appetizer and 1 small size will run you about $50."}
{"text":"Bring your earplugs and your patience. Extremely noisy to the point that our waiter could not even hear our orders. Service was slow and spotty. Meals were brought out at different times. Food (burgers) lukewarm. Sides brought out at different times than the meals. Sides were cool to cold. Baked potato barely warm enough to melt soft butter. Completely messed up a simple Burger order. Offered to replace after the rest of the party had finished their meals. Save your patience for another place. Save your ears."}
{"text":"If you're someone who doesn't get salads at restaurants this is worth breaking from trend. Steak was cooked to perfection. Great for a nice lunch or a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"I gave this place another shot and was floored by the 180 experience I had.  The service was outstanding, prompt, and I really enjoyed the food.  I'll give it a 4 star instead of 5 because of the terrible experience I had the first time...but I'll come back and update if the service maintains like it did yesterday evening.  Good food, Good service, can't ask for much more when its 50% off Tuesday nights."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late afternoon snack after shopping on Saturday...glad we did.   Interesting atmosphere, comfortable (padded) booths, good food and cold drinks!   Wife & I split a mushroom/cheeseburger, which arrived cut in 1/2 on 2 plates (nice!), small sides of fries & onion rings, and cold beer for each of us...it was 106* that afternoon..whew!  Everything was excellent!  Burger was outstanding, vinegar & sea salt fries and onion rings were just the right portions for us.   Excellent service from the staff, even though it was during the mid-afternoon lull at 3:00 pm. We'll definitely be back to try the steak menu.  Great place to bring friends too for a really good burger!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We were five at our table for lunch, two from Colorado and three from New York. We were greeted and seated the minute we walked in. The staff were personable and knowledgeable about their food and how it's prepared (we had many questions) . Each of us had something different and every one of us loved what we ordered. Just to name a few - we ordered the Brussel sprouts and sweet potato side as an appetizer and it was delicious. The macaroni carbonara was amazing; it had a fried egg on top rather than having it cooked into the pasta; this was a great way to present the dish--cutting into the egg and having the yolk mix into the already creamy pasta..YUM! We also had different burgers that were cooked to perfection; fries that were crispy and flavorful; and the salmon that was perfect. Just amazing food and service. I would go back in a heartbeat when we visit Scottsdale again, and highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had dinner there Saturday night, burgers, fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, tried all three desserts.  Everything was awesome!  Great food, wonderful service and a relaxing atmosphere.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  Also try the blackberry mojito!"}
{"text":"The Food -   3.5 - The Fish Sandwich had salmon as its protein, it was missing something but I couldn't say what. It also had pickled onions, lettuce, and tartar sauce, the bun was good.  5 - The Zucchini Fries were excellent. The dipping sauce was excellent. I would order again and again.   3 - The Cauliflower Gratin was ok. It was lukewarm but it had cheese so..... it was fine.   3.8 The Atmosphere was very bar like, with TVs indoors and outdoors. It reminded me of a mix between Hopdoddy and RnR, add in some unique and eclectic Alice in Wonderland style decor. I think I spotted one restoration hardware chandelier that, while beautiful, clashed a bit with the lacquer faux animal heads and white street lamps.  Overall score - 3.825 (I'll round up to 4 since they just opened)  I would try them again, this was their opening night and I am betting as they mature it will be better. I would say since it's more of a Chop House, I plan on trying a burger or piece of meat next time.   Service was great, friendly staff, they are still learning their menu and some items were not in stock yet. Meh."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our two young teenagers and we left full and happy!!! The service was great and the food was top-notch!! Kale salad, western bacon, baked potato with short rib, and the crispy chicken sandwich...all amazing!!! Not to mention the fries and onion rings!! Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this from my shopper at Nordstrom.  Can't believe I had not heard of this place.  Trendy but chill and the staff was very passionate about the menu.  Trust me, you want to ask for a recommendation from the staff and order it with the substitutions they suggest.  Definitely my new \"go to\" place that is close to home."}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend and his co-workers from the Czech Republic. Our waitress was training another waitress and she informed us that the restaurant just opened last week. All the staff was super attractive and nice.   We all had some form of burgers, appetizers, beers, and a bottle of wine. The fries were a little salty, but other than that the ambience was nice, a great location. Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"First time. Very good. We split the burger and the chicken salad and both were very good. The burger was top 5 definitely.  The salt and vinegar fries were my favorite and I don't love fries. Danielle was a great bartender and took awesome care of us. One downside was a wall of unique bourbons that were not on the menu. Very annoying. One my favorites and will be back and maybe the bourbon can come off the wall. P.S"}
{"text":"Happy hour food portions are great however the only beer we could get was Coors Light - not a large beer happy hour selection."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in my first experience here. The service was extremely slow and my iced tea was empty 3 time. Each time I had to alert the waitress that I needed more. We participated in The Restaurant week menu and again I was disappointed. I have been to many different locations in many States that for restaurant week. This was the first and only place that was set up that 2 people share an appetizer and desert. I'm not one to complain about price but at 44 a person people should not share these items. Also, the  filet seemed to be cooked next to fish on the grill."}
{"text":"Great new place! Staff is friendly and helpful. Super cool concept and there is something on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $18 for a small burger and fries by all means go here. We went here for lunch and we were the one of two couples in the entire restaurant. I had to ask for my drink more than once and the service overall was slow. We ordered fries, 2 drinks and 2 burgers and it was close to $70!! That seems like a lot of money for lunch, everything is ala cart so you're already paying $12 for a simple burger that comes with nothing and if you want fries or any side don't expect to pay anything less than $18-$20 for your meal. The food wasn't even that great, won't be going here again."}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale! Not only is the staff super friendly and attentive but the food and drinks can't be beat!   First thing you notice when you come in is the upbeat, exciting decor and overall ambiance of the restaurant. You can tell they are striving to be an affordable and welcoming chophouse for everyone without sacrificing the quality of the food. All the staff are very friendly and chill, which makes dinner a laid back and stress free experience, something hard to come by from other high end spots in Scottsdale.  Their Happy Hour is AMAZING! You can't beat the half off appetizers (wings and spin dip are to die for) and discounted signature cocktails. They make like half a dozen different types of ice cubes that they use in their drinks, super fun and unique. Whoever is in the kitchen though is always cooking up the best food. Their burgers are all delicious, but the filet is unmatched. It's super simple but still crazy buttery, tender, and flavorful!!   I highly recommend checking this place out and seeing for yourself just how amazing they are!"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in the door, this place captures you with their atmosphere! Fun, eclectic, modern! It just beckons you to stay and have a good time! They really thought of all the details. We were sitting at a booth, but I happened to notice that every couple chairs at the bar, they had USB ports for your phones! GENIUS! Now, THAT'S how you keep people in your seats! (Aside from great food of course) The food was really good! We started with the onion rings, which I loved the concept of, however the ranch dressing seasoning was so thick and heavy that they were way over-salty. It was to the point that it burned your taste buds almost and hurt from all the salt. I REALLY wanted to like them, we just needed the ranch toned down.  Both of our burgers were phenomenal! Perfectly cooked, great flavor!  We shared a side of the mac & cheese...which I could eat every day for the rest of my life, quite happily.  We really enjoyed watching the bartender work, they seem to really put a lot of effort into their drinks and create really unique products. We didn't try any ourselves, but it sure made us want to! Overall it was a great experience, my largest complaint is just the price is really steep for burgers and fries kind of food. It was delicious! But not worth the price tag. However, I know they recently started a $10 meal deal which definitely has me interested to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing atmosphere, great music and great food. The waiters and waitresses are awesome and fast! I drank a ton of water and my glass was never empty. Im definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Couple more visits...disappointing food. Nice vibe and wish them the best. But expected more from the burger and sides."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and have had a wide array of items, from appetizers, burgers, desserts, drinks - I've never received anything that was short of extraordinary.  The vibe is great with modern decor and an open feeling that is great for a casual lunch or a fun evening out with a group. Parking is convenient via the underground garage that exits right next door.  I have and will continue to go out of my way to eat here!"}
{"text":"I'm a burger SNOB. This was in my top 20 burgers of all time. Atmosphere was great. Staff was friendly. Service a bit slow and ditzy but overall still a great experience."}
{"text":"Great new spot right in the Old Town - Fashion Square Scottsdale area. It is a burger Chop House with a very unique concept. Came for the soft opening which was fantastic. Definitely will be on the hit list of normal spots. Friendly outgoing beautiful courteous staff that is here to help and explain everything. Has a cool eclectic modern but relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"I discovered Hand Cut from a fellow Wild Dining MeetUp member, who told me he was coming here to eat on upcoming Tues for half price off 'the Cuts\".  When I looked at the menu, I came on the same night in Aug, and saw him there.  He invited me to join him at his table.  Sara the Eurasian girl with long honey-colored hair, was our server.   She was so cute, adorable vivacious personality, and pretty, and came back to check on us at least 5 times!  We both ordered the venison chops, 2 for $11.  They were quite rare on the inside, but I like my red meat very red on inside.  The chops were so delicious.  We shared 2 half orders of onion rings $3, but the second order came out almost burnt and very very salty, like cook dumped the salt box in the coating.  By the time we had a couple of pieces there was really nothing to send back, so we didn't.    I give the service and venison chops 5 stars for my first visit!.  I was so impressed that I posted with only day's notice, another Tues 1/2 off Cuts on my Wild Dining MeetUp for my 2nd time on Sept 26, 2017.  Four people ordered venison chops, I ordered the 8 oz flat iron steak (very mediocre wouldn't order it again.  I could get a much better deal and taste at Golden Corral).    My receipt says Taylor was our server, a very tall thin girl with dark hair wadded up in two buns on each side of her head.  The Organizer of our Wild Dining MeetUp ordered her chops \"medium\", but it came as the rest of ours, bloody rare and definitely NOT \"medium\".  She sent it back, changed her order to the safer filet mignon.   I would have asked them to cook the chops longer, cos I hate waste and so sad to see the venison chops thrown in the trash (they have open kitchen you can see them prepare the food).  I do not know why the server who takes the orders does not also bring the food, cos other guys brought the food, and didn't know who ordered what.  They just put the food down in front of the wrong people, and we remarked they didn't even ask us \"who ordered the onion rings\" so they could plop down in front of the right person.  So our orders got all mixed up, and they left it up to \"us\" to make the corrections.  And of course, when the bills came, they put the wrong food orders on the wrong people's bills.  And someone had to take back the checks to get them corrected.    They seemed to have a designated person just to fill people's water glasses, so that was OK, but I do not recall that our server ever came back like Sara did (and 5 times) my first visit , to check on us.  I only saw Taylor when she took our orders.  In the end, we all talked about how poor the service was, especially just bringing the food and putting the wrong items in front of the wrong people without asking.  Myself, and the MeetUp organizer talked to Manager Brandon about being so unhappy with the service.  He appreciated our feedback and said they will do better next time.  1 or two stars for this second visit.  OK, third visit is Tues Oct 24, 2017, when I repost the same MeetUp as above to Wild Dining.  We sit at the same table for 8 in the back, and about 9 people on the waiting list occupy two nearby booths.  GM Brandon is no longer working there, already, so I told Kiley, Acting GM and bartender, about our poor service the previous time.  Kiley comped our table of 8, several free appetizers, and deliberately assigned my favorite Sara to be our server.  Sara did a GREAT job, and both Kiley and Sarah came back to ask us if everything was OK, several times.  Almost everyone ordered ribeye, and it was all perfectly grilled.  So delicious.  We all loved the food, and said we will be back again and again, but no one said they wanted to come back and pay full price on another night.  We will come back on Tues nights for half price cuts.  I give my first and third visits 5 stars for food and service, but 1-2 stars for the second time.  So overall 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place had a cool vibe and seemed great for birthday parties for mid-sized groups of people.  There were a couple celebrations going on when my friends and I went for dinner.  That said, I wasn't super impressed with what I ordered, and wished I had ordered something else.  I got the Crispy Chicken sandwich, and specifically wasn't a huge fan of the fried tempura.  I was hoping there would be some sort of light and crunchy breading instead of fried batter.  It kind of weighed down the sandwich.  Also, the sandwich tasted fine, but the chicken was a bit dry.  If I go back to Hand Cut, I'd order a burger or a steak next time.  I did try the Salt & Vinegar fries though, and really enjoyed those!  They came with ranch dressing on the side, and that complimented the fries nicely."}
{"text":"Burgers were amazing.  Jalapeño slaw was great and Brussels sprouts with honey was perfect.  Fries were the only challenge... hard and didn't taste fresh.  However, the taste of the burger made up for the fries.  Go there!!"}
{"text":"Was brought by friends to this restaurant on a weekend. Location wasn't too full and was quickly able to get a table without reservations. Ordered the tempura zucchini- would have preferred the strips to be thinner so could have had a better texture. Western and California burgers were good but nothing special to return to."}
{"text":"The most amazing food I have had in Scottsdale.   I lived in Scottsdale for 8 years, and hated going out because a lot of times I was stuck between going to Olive and Ivy or The Montauk for dinner as those were the only places with great food and decor. I recently moved to LA, but my last day in AZ, I decided to try this restaurant which I always saw but never went in.   I hate myself now for not coming in sooner. Seriously delicious!   Ordered the beets and burrata, fried zucchini (AMAZING) , steak, mashed potatoes, asparagus and Mac n cheese. Seriously amazing.   Like I am drooling thinking of how good it was.   Service was ehh and the server wore a bra top.. I mean I don't really want my food touching your belly button piercing. But honestly the food was so good, that it didn't matter."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and I knew I had to try it. I had the chance last Sunday and I love how it is decorated -and they carry the decor out onto the sidewalk. We were greeted and sat immediately. Service was good, in fact the one thing I did notice is that they weren't rushing us out of there like some burger joints do. We had time to visit and enjoyed it. We indulged in the macaroni carbonara as a shared appy. Delicious! We shared the Cobb salad, a blue cheese burger and the salt and vinegar fries. I really wasn't in the mood for fries until I tasted these. And then I couldn't stop eating them. Everything was fantastic. I will be back because I need to try the short rib melt and the onion rings- I spied some at another table and they looked excellent."}
{"text":"HandCuts service is excellent, Kirsten is a fantastic server with a bright personality and kind smile. I saw a video that included Kylee, their bartender creating an incredible Manhattan on Facebook, although I'm not a fan of whiskey she makes some of the best margaritas in town! Not the biggest fan of their entrees but their appetizers and salads kill it. My personal favorite is the steak tartare and salmon toast. The Kale Caesar and Steak Salad is a great choice for the health freaks. Salt and vinegar fries hit the spot."}
{"text":"First time visit yesterday and glad we stopped by. Sunday evening, the place was not busy so walked right in. Service was spot on, friendly and attentive. While their drink menu was very interesting except for me, our party stuck with soft drinks. I had a pour of good rye whisky, a good pairing with one of their excellent burgers. We all had burgers of one form or another. I had mushroom cheddar, wife had classic, the the two others in our party had the jalapeno burger. We all had dill and vinegar fries. Everything was excellent. Juicy burgers with lots of toppings and fries were very tasty.   Good food, good service and good prices. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Our bartender Sam was the best bartender and server we've ever had. She was incredibly attentive and sweet even though it was busy and she was training new staff. All bartenders should be like her. I will be definitely coming back for the great drinks and service!! AMAZING!"}
{"text":"ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have very mixed feelings about Hand Cut. It is right around the corner from my house so I love the convenience. The food is amazing, great steaks and phenomenal veal. My only trouble with Hand Cut is that the service I get there is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes they are sharp and quick and sometimes I'll get a server who doesn't know what a \"neat\" drink is and forget my table exists. Still haven't decided if this place is for me, let's see if they can pull it together and tighten up a bit!   UPDATE: Kevin has reached out to me and because of their amazing marketing and customer service, I'm confident that they will be taking care of me in the future and genuinely care about improving. (Hence the adjustment of my review). I will be eating here much more as time continues!"}
{"text":"The Cloud LGS team chose Hand Cut Burgers for its location and selection of delicious sounding burgers. We had a team of 12 sitting for lunch and we all loved our food. The staff were very accommodating to our large group and was on top of all of our orders.   The food was so good there was a moment where we weren't looking at our phones or talking, just purely enjoying the moment."}
