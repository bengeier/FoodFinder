{"text":"I've been coming to Mapleside since I was a child and usually enjoy it, but lately my visits there haven't been great. Both times I stopped there recently there was no indoor restroom like they've always had. The only restrooms were Porta-Potties at the bottom of a medium sized hill behind the main building. I went with a relative who had just got out of the hospital following hip surgery. They were using a cane and were unable to use the rest room because they could not walk down a hill. Seriously? No indoor restrooms? So what are people with various handicaps and health conditions supposed to do? Or if there's awful weather outside, people who come in spending lots of money on cider, apples and gifts don't even have a decent indoor restroom to use? It's just plain rude and unacceptable. Unless this is changed, I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not the one for outdoor activities but I had a blast it was a nice group of us with small kids that enjoyed the sack ride, jump house, tractor ride, huge pillow to jump on and the home made EXTRA large tub slide. The place has even walking tacos!! Great apple cider- Like I said we made it a family event and had two small kids that had fun even when it got out and my daughter kept saying-is a zombie going to come out like \"Walking Dead\" Bring a flash light to if you plan on staying to dark.... Luv this place but did find the apples pricey along withe carmel apples($10) also!"}
{"text":"Good old fashion place, great buffet"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I can't wait to get back. I'll never pass by this place without stopping. Christmas time is my favorite time to in the midwest. The food is amazing, treated extremely well. Atmosphere is perfect."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be Mapleside, now it's Melrose and I am less than impressed.  Waited 40 minutes for food.  Received rancid corn bread.  Cole slaw was mushy and slimy. Smoked chicken was not smoked.  Kids hamburger bun was toasted (most kids don't prefer).  We talked with the manager and our concerns, especially the corn bread, were not validated.  The manager said the rest of the loaf was fine, it was only our two pieces.  He would not smell it.  I felt like he thought we were trying to get something for nothing.  He did give us free ice cream and passes to the ($3) play area.  We just wanted validation, not something free. I felt the manager was patronizing."}
{"text":"An oasis in the overdeveloped world that we live in.  It's family friendly, has an amazing view and great food/drink options.  This is a much see when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Lots to do from corn mazes to zombie paintball. Be prepared though for long lines and lots of little ones. Also there are no indoor restrooms open to guest just minimal outhouses. Most outhouses are way gross and covered in pea. If your lucky theres toilet papper, and if you need a handycap bathroom your out of luck. So go before you go."}
{"text":"Love this place for everything from apples to family fun to 101 photo opps! Awesome destination for all ages and interests."}
{"text":"Visited Mapleside this past weekend for their Johnny Appleseed festival.  I knew it would be crowded and parking would be a disaster, which was exactly the case.  I feel bad for the people who live near this place and have to deal with all the excess traffic backing up down the road.  

I really have mixed feelings about Mapleside.  It is truly a gorgeous setting, and they have a lot to offer. We stayed for about 3 hours and had only seen about half of what was offered.  They are constantly having special events here to cater to a wide variety of interests.  You should check out their website if you're ever looking for something to do.  The top of the hill features plenty of stuff to keep young children happy and entertained (without having to pay the admission fee).  The apple-cider-slushie I had was delicious and refreshing.

A lot of what made our experience less-than-great could have been avoided with more information (either better signage or info on the website).  We initially walked around the back of the building trying to find the entrance to the restaurant (which is not open for business currently).  My relatives, who veered left (correctly), paid for entrance to \"Pumpkin Village\" without realizing that they didn't have to (everything at the top of the hill is free admission).  The hill from the entrance to Pumpkin Village down to the activities is not trivial, and not doable for those with mild mobility issues, so part of our group went home early and disappointed.  The only restrooms available are porta-potties.  I did not ask any staff members, but did not see any diaper-changing accommodations.

If you're looking for an all-day amusement/festival experience, Mapleside is a good bet.  If you just want a low-key pumpkin farm/apple orchard, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Writing a 4 star review only because I know I wasn't able to see everything they have to offer. My family and I came here during the Johnny appleseed festival. So they were very busy. Lots to offer here though, I assume most of it was because the festival was going on. 

The biggest attraction is the slide near the top of the farm. It's labeled the world tallest slide. And it is very fun. I took my son down it twice and I've never seen him so happy. They have this long corn maze that's a joy to walk through. And the general scenery, it's gorgeous. Anyone with young children should definitely come here. If not for the scenery and slide? For the fresh produce they have."}
{"text":"I stopped at Mapleside Farms recently on a weekday.  It was a deserted ghost town.  The sign outside indicated the Bakery was open.  It was very sparse, with a few different baked goods and only one employee working.  
Sadly, The Apple House, the market section of Mapleside Farms is now closed until June.  First Mapleside was purchased by new owners, then the wonderful \"Apple Room\" Restaurant closed, then the gift shop section closed, now the market as well (at least until June.)  It is nothing like it was back in the day in the pre-new owner time.
To be fair, Mapleside Farms does still host special events - The Johnny Appleseed Festival, Breakfast with Santa, Easter Bunny Brunch and is available as a venue for weddings.  But the regular days of a special meal, gift and market shopping are gone.  Goodbye to incredible sticky buns, Waldorf salad that was amazing, and now Caramel Apples - which were still available year round in the market.
Very regrettably, another wonderful special place that has changed beyond recognition.  Perhaps they should only be open on weekends and for special events."}
{"text":"A great place to come in the fall with the kiddies. So many activities like going on a hay ride, hay maze, play area, a huge slide, restarant, farmers market and various other's I'm sure. I love coming here and making a day out of it. Don't forget to plan in advance, this place can get overly packed. Sometimes, it may not even be worth it considering wait times. In the end, if I make the trip out to Brunstucky I'm going to the festival, but don't say I didn't warn you about the lines."}
{"text":"We came here during the fall family weekend. Unfortunately, zombie paintball sold out, but we still had a good time. The weather was a little chilly, but that just made the hot chocolate and cider that much better. The pig races were entertaining and cute, the corn maze was fun (even though we ran into some not so friendly guests...and a friend fell in the mud, but that's laughable now), and the time spent with friends among such beautiful scenery was wonderful. We'll definitely return next year, better prepared for some paintball and to pick out some pumpkins."}
{"text":"This lovely farm is on my list of places to go every single fall. It's now a tradition with my husband and I. There's always so much to do from the hay rides and corn mazes to the tractor pig rides. (one of my favorites) Not to mention the view this place has is incredible! You must come here when the leaves start changing colors and pick out a pumpkin to carve for the Halloween season!!"}
{"text":"My friend Heather remembers Mapleside Farm from her childhood as a place her parents took her every fall to pick out pumpkins. She describes Mapleside as one of her favorite places so in the fall when I mentioned that I needed to do a \"fall activity\" Mapleside was the first place that came to her mind. We made the trip after work on a Thursday and although the leaves were just starting to change, the gorgeous views provided by Mapleside Farms in Brunswick are worth the trip in any season. Later in the fall the view is to die for.  The Restaurant sits atop a hill and overlooks a tranquil wooded and pastoral valley. One thing to note about Mapleside Farms: you will feel like you are dining at your mom's country kitchen table. If the place wasn't so clean and quaint, some of the decorating could be perceived as \"tacky.\" For example, the stairs of the second floor dining area overlooking the rolling hills of the valley are adorned with a wooden banister with apple shaped cutouts. The main wall of the dining room holds the largest wall quilt I have ever seen. But the entire restaurant, completely covered in woodwork, looks so clean and airy that these decorating elements work wonderfully to create charming country dining. Not tacky at all! 

One thing that immediately struck us was how genuinely nice the staff was. In fact, the waiter was sooo nice I kept expecting him to ask for my number. Nope! He was just genuinely nice and seemed to enjoy bringing me my bottomless glasses of apple cider (yes, bottomless!). I have to say, if you are looking for comfort food, look no further than Mapleside. I had to take pictures of my plate because the food looked that good when it came out. Heather had pot roast, mashed potatoes and gravy, with a side of corned bread dressing. I couldn't help but order the barbequed pork sandwich. I subbed out the french fries for roasted potatoes. I also added a side of waldorf salad; after all, we were at an apple orchard! They make the dressing for the Waldorf salad in house and is refreshing. The potatoes were cooked perfectly, not too hard, not too soft. And I barely used the bbq sauce (which is their own recipe using apples) because the flavor was perfect without the sauce. The most unique thing about Mapleside's dinner, besides the view, was that the before dinner rolls were actually sticky rolls: dinner rolls topped with pecans and a honey sauce. \"Farm\" doesn't come to mind when most people think fine dining. And maybe Mapleside isn't a \"fine dining\" establishment. But it is fun, tastee, reasonably priced, and has breathtaking views. I would take that over \"fine\" nine times out of ten. 

Also, you can bag your own apples on the weekends in the fall. Check out their website for more information. http://www.mapleside.com/calendar.html"}
{"text":"Here's my Mapleside Rating Equation...

+5 Stars = I've been coming here since I was a little girl. Mostly with my grandma so this place has a lot of nostaglia going on for me. The grounds are gorgeous, there's something just breathtaking about this piece of land.

-2 Stars = I'm not sure if Mapleside is under new ownership but in my opinion they've waaaaaaaaay over commercialized this place! I know, I know they need to make money and having droves of kids and their families come in everyday of the week is the way to get it - but it just made it, well, less magical for me.

-3 Stars = I know Mother Nature is to blame for our recent bouts of rain - but OMG, can we say MUD PIT?! The weekend I visited my shoes were ruined (my bad for not thinking ahead and wearing rain boots), but everywhere you stepped it was squish, squash - so nasty.

-1 Star = The hayride was pulled by a tractor... last year they had beautiful horses pulling the rides. While I'm a fan of those horsies getting some rest, it took away from the legit country-esque feeling for me.

+1 Star = The corn maze, while I did not partake - was sweet! You could see it from atop the hill and it looked HUGE! Plus, they had an awesome looking Jump Park (kids only, sorry adults!) that was filled with screaming (with joy, of course) kids.

+1 Star = For *effort* in attempting to create a \"Super Slide\" down the hill as an alternative route to Pumpkin Village. But, it was a major fail. Even with a generous amount of baby oil and what looked like tire shine slopped on - adults and kids alike were having a hard time making it all the way down.

-2 Stars = Where did the seasonal nicknack shop go?! Last year we were able to purchase the cutest Halloween decoations that looked very artsy and now this year all I could find were wood puzzles and blankies?! Very sad.

+2 Stars = Thank God, the cider was still available and so were the delicious and large! caramel apples. Mmmmm...

+1 Star = Huge pumpkin selection and you could hit up the patch with your kids or pick one out in the shop.

+2 Stars = They were selling Campbell's Sweets Factory Fruity Popcorn - yummie! Definitely picked up some of that.

I am a fan, Mapleside, but you had me wishing we could rewind about ten years."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience this afternoon.  Place looked nice.  Wait staff was very good.  Enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back, so much to do for the kids and the food is great in the bakery.  It will wear any kid out and you'll have fun too"}
{"text":"Good county restaurant.  Apple dishes good.  Changed to Melrose Grill, then now Orchard House."}
{"text":"Mapleside sure has changed since I was a kid. They have amped up the ante and brought in more activities and fun things to do with a family. The apples are more expensive here than other places but they taste great. This is a good place to come for fall activities for all ages. I would go again."}
{"text":"Nice family friendly fall festival for a fun Friday night atmosphere. Kids had fun. No apple picking like I assumed. Some of the amenities were not open though. 
Miss the old restaurant too. Got some cider, apples and treats. Nice ice cream stand too."}
{"text":"This is a review that has been long overdue for me.  Mapleside Farms is so much more than just a farm.

They have done a wonderful job of offering a lot of activities people of all ages.  During the summer that have outdoor concerts showcasing many local CLE talents like Carlos Jones, and others. 

They also offer up a restaurant called Melrose Grille.  I have never eaten there, but the inside is surprisingly nice, and the menu offers a wide array of options.  In addition to this you can also grab a cannoli from the Corbo's Bakery on site, and of course stock up on apples, cider, and all of their amazing apple related products.

No autumn in CLE is complete without a trip to Mapleside Farms!"}
{"text":"Meh. Drug my boyfriend here to grab an apple cider slushie and look at the nice views for five minutes. Took some pics that turned out crappy anyways, then left. 

Perhaps it's just the nostalgia captured from memories of my childhood when my grandma took me here for creme filled candies, but as an adult this place is overpriced, boring, and filled with loud children (aka snivlers) at peak times. Took home some kolachkies for myself and our elderly polish neighbors who later notified us that they weren't baked long enough. For five bucks a pack, I ate every single one of my kolachkies. 

Anyway, I don't want to turn anyone off to this, especially anyone with children, because this is a good place to take the fam. Definately a place to see once, or grab some apples or something like that."}
{"text":"Completely asinine set up for pumpkins. There's no carts, no wheel barrels and no assistance. They expect you to carry pumpkins up a hill, across the parking lot and all the way inside to pay and then from there across the street to the parking lot where your car is. I'm 100% going to Giant Eagle next year for my pumpkins. They look the same anyway..."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this nice countryside farm,well for me it was countryside, theres no \"farms\" in New York City lol.

Went for their yearly pumpkin festival, pricing was a bit higher than other places i had looked at but was totally worth it. $12 was all inclusive, only wish they allowed my 2 1/2 year old in for free since he was still 2 (technically) but eh. We went during the johnny appleseed fest too so we got 2 things for the price of one which keeps mama happy! They have a great play area for children, with a jumping pillow, a great tire mountain, spider web swing and a playground. They also have a 300 foot long slide, great for the kids, my husband and boys were so excited for it. Its quite a climb back up the hill though (FEEL THAT BURN). The scenery was beautiful, set along a quite valley in Brunswick, the fall foliage was  breathtaking, and it has plenty of photo ops. Pig and Cow rides ( fake of course), 3 corn mazes, and another play area for kids.

My only gripe is this place boasts itself as being a orchard, and i didnt get to pick one apple nor was there a pumpkin patch big enough to actually go picking in. Everything was already inside their store picked for you, took the fun out of what i was trying to show my sons. 

They had a great food stand, fresh cut fries, mozzarella sticks, ribs, pulled pork, the usual fair foods. Pricing was fine for the food portion. THEY HAVE SQUARE READERS HALLELUJAH!

Overall, we had an awesome day at mapleside farms and i would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely packed when we came this past Saturday morning. Seeing so many other people, I thought it had to be great! We walked through the gift shop area first, and they had bags of apples for sale, not for a great price, but they looked nice. There was also a bakery that looked nice, but it appears to be a branch of Corbo's, which is a bakery close to where we live, so we decided not to get anything there. As we continued to walk around, it was apparent that it was a very family friendly place, geared towards families with young children. My husband and I felt that the activities were not really for us, as we're both 25. The pumpkins available were $0.50/lb, and the cider was also quite expensive. We saw the huge lines for the bouncy house/trampoline and wandered towards the \"Pumpkin Village.\" The only activity we saw there that would interest us was the large SuperHero themed corn maze-- but we were told we would need a wristband for the corn maze, which would cost $12. The wrist band is also good for other activities that did not interest us (like the hayrides and bouncy houses). There was also a \"pumpkin patch\" which was just pumpkins randomly placed in a field. We could see how all the activities would appeal to small children, but it was just not interesting for us as childless adults. We did buy some apples before we left which have been tasty! 

If you are looking for reasonable prices for pumpkins or apples, short, fast-moving lines, or fun activities for those over the age of 10-- this is not the place. For pumpkins and apples, we far prefer Eddy Fruit Farm on Caves Road."}
{"text":"This used to be a wonderful place that was friendly to the locals. Growing up, we would take field trips here with Kidder School and the former owners were lovely people. I appreciate that the current owners have tried to diversify this place and make it a draw to areas outside of Brunswick, but I'm no longer a fan. 

Prior to the closing of the Orchard House, I attended a bridal shower here. The shower guests will had to park in the field and they barely let me drop off my 95 year old grandmother in front of the venue. There was no way she was walking through a field. Are you kidding me? The place was so crowded that people were trying to crash the shower. Bar service was miserably slow when I went to purchase apple cider and took 20 minutes for service. 

I work seasonally in a Halloween store (in addition to my actual career, because it's fun) and in past years I've had managers from Mapleside berate me for being out of costumes because they're having an event. It's a big chain, we don't control the inventory. But they would feel more important than the other customers because they were Mapleside managers. They also had to let you know at least 3 times per transaction that they are managers at Mapleside, as if they are all important czars. 

Back in the day, all our high school banquets would be at Mapleside. I attended many weddings here and it used to be a place we went out to dinner before school dances. It was a place that welcomed Brunswick residents. The people working there used to be friendly. Now it's a local-hating, traffic creating, snobby tourist trap. Take your kids somewhere the staff won't be too \"important\" to acknowledge you and you won't get stuck in traffic every weekend just driving down Pearl Road. Hillside in Hinckley is a great alternative and the bakery is actually edible."}
{"text":"Excellent have a great time with the grandkids coupon when you go great place to tire the kids out bouncy thing built into the ground they love that. The kids love the jacket slide of the tree house corn mazes were fun only would complain that was a $5 tn yep we're looking forward to in the caramel like a rock great place"}
{"text":"food is average. prices are too high in both restaurant and store."}
{"text":"Was able to bring the boy out here on his first visit to Cleveland and we wound up coming back the next day as well!  The Johnny Appleseed festival was on this past weekend and we had a blast sitting on the lawn overlooking the valley below stuffing ourselves with good food and listening to a Journey cover band.

We didn't try out the restaurant but if their food in there is half as good as the apple dumplings we wolfed down, it would be worth a stop in to try out some homemade cooking.

Apple picking abounds and pumpkin picking will soon be starting as well, if you've got a munchkin or two, this would definitely be a great place to bring them...heck, even if you don't, you'll soon feel like a kid again while roaming the grounds of Mapleside.

Keep your eye on their website for their \"Concerts over the valley\" series, there were a ton of people out on Saturday for the show and it was a lot of fun.  Bring your blankets or chairs to sit on, a flock of Canadian geese like to spend their time on that hill as well  ;o)"}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday evening, great service and ambiance. Had the barbecue brisket special, it did not disappoint. My lovely wife had a pasta dish which was good but, she enjoyed my brisket more."}
{"text":"Waited about 15 minutes and they server was fantastic. The food was excellent and could not have had a better experiennce"}
{"text":"A great family place to enjoy an Ohio fall!  Be prepared it's crazy busy on the weekend.  Parking is in fields across the street.  The bakery has everything pumpkin you could want.  The ice cream window has the most delish hot cider donut sundae!!  Get pumpkin ice cream on it!! They have s huge food selection but it's ok.  For $12 you can enjoy all the attractions-hay ride, super slide built in the hill, huge corn maze, petting farm, and more.  Of course, I almost forgot you can get apples, cider, and pumpkins. They are in truly a beautiful setting with gorgeous views."}
{"text":"Two words: Zombie Paintball

After dusk you can journey down the Mapleside property to a dark, secluded barn where military personnel train you on how to shoot zombies. In the woods. At night. You'll get goggles, a gun and 100 paintballs to take down some 'bies and you'll do it on a tractor. I'm sorry, but there's something about the woods at night... and tractors... and corn mazes... it just freaks me out. 

As you get pulled slowly through the woods, you'll spot spooky areas glowing with black light and then... they appear! Stumbling towards you--ready to eat your brains! I think I wasted most of my ammo on the first two zombie encounters, but don't worry--they'll let you refill halfway through for a small fee. 

And if I could make any suggestions for first timers, it's this: 
- PRE-ORDER your tickets online! This is a must. They practically sell out every night.
- BRING CASH! Most everything at this place is cash only. 

Lastly, don't let your kiddies miss out on the huge jumping pillow and playground, they'll love it! This really is a great fall activity and worth the drive out. Just remember, this place gets really packed now!"}
{"text":"The Barn at Mapleside is absolutely a beautiful venue. We had a celebration of life event there on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. The catering staff was awesome too!  PS. Fix the front parking lot by the lodge it's awful."}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend when the weather was perfect for a lovely fall afternoon outside. We checked out the store inside first and picked up some green bean chips, an apple fritter, and apple cider that we enjoyed while sitting on a rock wall outside and taking in the beautiful fall scenery. I only give this place three stars because we did not stay too long because they were having a family event and it was getting pretty crowded. I would go back though maybe, and check out a hayride or the corn maze. 

Side note, don't get the pumpkin roll unless you want to be disappointed. They make theirs with an icing inside instead of cream cheese. Just way too sweet for my tastes."}
{"text":"I loved the apple cider and picking out my own pumpkins! This place is SO cute, I went here around Halloween to find pumpkins to carve and they had a HUGE assortment to choose from. Everything was reasonably priced, plus they had so many pastries to choose from as well. Totally will go back :)"}
{"text":"Mapleside is an excellent place to take all your family and friends.  Our kids love the activities and it keeps them happy for hours.  We love the food at the Orchard House and always get bags of apples for home."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in our Friday morning visit. We brought our two toddlers on a warm mid Nov day. The bakery was sparse and no one was working there. It took a while to get service. They don't make doughnuts on weekdays either. Why are they even open on weekdays if they only cater to a weekend crowd? After we got cider, we went to play on the playground, but about 15 mins in, an employee kicked us out and said it was closed - even though there were no signs. Patterson Farm is much cuter and family friendly. We won't be visiting here again."}
{"text":"it can be cool.. but most of the events are priced way too high for a family to go.. I can see charging more for the kids.. but its not worth going there if your dropping a $50-$60 just to get into an event and then have to spend more..  its not Cedar Point"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Mapleside Farms a lot. There was a ton of stuff to do, lots of good fall photo opportunities and even zombie paintball. They also sell alcoholic beverages for those of us that need it when the kids get to be too much. They do have a kid area with a jump pad and playground but I didn't go in, as I don't have kids. I didn't, but I've heard you can pick your own pumpkins and apples. They have hay rides, corn mazes, good food, pumpkin patches and animals. 

Zombie Paintball was okay. I saw a lot of people complaining that the zombies weren't \"real enough\" but don't read too much in to that. Not sure what people expect, when it's real people getting shot at. Of course they're going to have a lot of padding and not be able to run at you. It was fun to shoot paintball after dark regardless though. I would suggest buying your paintball tickets on Groupon. Overall the experience was great. There were a TON of people and yes you had to wait in line, but it wasn't a bad wait and what do you expect around fall time?"}
{"text":"Mapleside Farms is the closest real life replica to a Thomas Kinkade painting that I can think of. Rolling acres, picturesque trees, breathtaking views of apple orchards, pumpkin patches, fields of corn, streams, ponds, wood burning fireplaces and comfort food galore. 

Memories of childhood mean a lot to me. I remember taking family trips to Mapleside to pick out pumpkins and sip hot cider in the fall. But it wasn't until later in life that I got to appreciate all of those memories to the fullest. A recent return to Mapleside Farms reminded me of those childhood memories. Everything was as beautiful as I once remembered it. The apple dumplings as mouth watering and the cider as warm as it was 20 some years prior. This place hasn't changed one bit through all those years. And this is a good thing! If there's a better destination for autumn related activities and scenery in North East Ohio, I'm not familiar with it. To me, Mapleside Farms is it."}
{"text":"We've been going to Mapleside Farms for years, and in the past five years (since the Clements bought it) it has gotten continually better each year. The highlights include a giant bounce pillow for jumping (my kids' favorite part), a giant wall of pumpkins and gourds (great fall family photo opps), huge corn mazes, several hayride options, pumpkin carving station, water duck races, a huge tee-pee to explore, bonfires scattered throughout, and zombie paintball-- against the backdrop of the most beautiful orchard in Ohio. The owners have done an amazing job of cultivating a festive fall family fest, and they deserve 5 stars. Take your family here- you won't regret it! 

PS: the zombie paintball is a separate charge. You buy tickets for a time, but they don't exactly manage the times. Meaning: go whenever you want to go. The only thing the ticket does is make sure you don't get locked out when they sell out. My kids have been begging to go for years, and this year was our first time trying it. The whole experience is so well done.  Make sure you watch the backstory with your kids on lightupthelivingdead.com before going. That gives them more context about how the zombies came to be & why they need to be hunted. it was spooky and fun and very well organized. If you're not into zombie hunts, there's all the pumpkins, apples, hayrides & all the other fall festival goodness. My favorite part of zombie paintball: the paintballs were pink :)"}
{"text":"I have younger brothers that we began taking to the Santa breakfast every Christmas and the tradition of visiting Mapleside continues with my niece. Last year, I don't remember having any complaints about the Santa breakfast. However, this year was a very different story. I'm not sure what is going on with the space, but this year, the breakfast was held in the newly built barn on Mapleside's grounds.

I arrived early than the rest of my family with children, who were running a bit late. As soon as I walked into the barn, I almost gagged on the dusty smell of the newly constructed barn. The barn seemed clean, but I couldn't get over the foul smell that should never be paired with enjoying a meal out. The food was being shuttled over to the barn from the main building. The plates were paper, and the silverware plastic. The buffet offered eggs, hash brown potatoes, sausage, bacon, biscuits and gravy and French toast sticks. All of the food was the same quality you would expect to find at a complimentary hotel breakfast. In fact, the whole meal for the most part, was exactly like a hotel breakfast. The difference at Mapleside though is that you are paying over $20 for this breakfast. The greatest highlight was that they served hot cider, and the kiddos all really enjoyed the chocolate fountain. 

While other family members were about 15 minutes late, we were clearly being rushed out by the staff. Different staff came by our table one after another to ask if they could clear plates that we were still eating from. It was extremely frustrating given all of the other aspects of this breakfast that made for a poor experience. 

I'm not sure what happened to our tradition, but as the years have passed, the price has skyrocketed and the quality decreased greatly. I'm sorry to say that unless something changes, we will not be returning to Mapleside for our annual breakfast with Santa."}
{"text":"Pretty cool farm.  It is big with lots of activities.  Definitely check online for special events, it can get very crowded."}
{"text":"Bought tickets for their light up the dead zombie paintball. Our tickets were for 8 pm. We arrived at 7:45 and then waited will 8:15. Then found out that the expected wait time was another hour and a half. 

An actual Zombie Apocalypse would be less torturous than standing in a line for 30 minutes that didn't move. We decided to get a refund and were told there were no refunds. I managed to get a refund but then heard them deny refunds to others right after I got my money. If you can't handle an event, don't sell tickets. I wish there was a 0 star rating."}
{"text":"Pumpkins, apple cider, corn mazes, pumpkins, ice cream, apples, pumpkins, zombie paintball, and did I mention pumpkins? I can't believe it's taken me this long to visit Mapleside Farms. 

Pumpkins are my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE part of fall. So one weekend on a suggestion from a friend I went on a visit to Mapleside for an afternoon adventure. My date and I had a great time exploring the Pumpkin Village, including the long slide that takes you down to the bottom where there are hay rides and corn mazes. Yes, slide. You have the option to either walk down to the bottom or ride down a slide on a feed sack. Is there really a question as to which option you should choose? 

At the bottom there is not one, but two corn mazes to venture through. Getting lost in stalks of corn is not the only option you have at the bottom of the hill, there are hay rides and apple cider to complete the fun. 

Once you're done with the pumpkin village, definitely head up to the restaurant for a bite to eat before you leave. And no trip to Mapleside would be complete unless you leave with a bag of apples, apple cider, and most importantly a pumpkin."}
{"text":"If you have kids, this place is a NE Ohio gem and a 'must visit' for a fun, farm experience!  I took my 8 year old daughter to Mapleside for the first time today, and she had a total blast for the 4 hours we were there!  The place was a bit crowded when we got there at 130PM, but there was more than ample parking across the street in a grassy lot (I hear weekends can be way too crowded, with long lines, especially around Halloween and if the weather is nice).  Police were there as well, directing pedestrians and traffic for safety (liked that).  This place is a huge, 100 acre or so family farm, with a gift shop, bakery, restaurant, snack stands, and concession stands.  There are many attractions for kids, since the focus is on them here.  Today, Friday was half price, and we got to walk through 2 really cool corn mazes (an amazing maize maze!), go on hayrides through endless orchards, tractor pulled kiddie cars in the shape of a pig or cow, go down a long slide that winds down a hill, walk through a pumpkin patch and pick pumpkins, jump on a huge inflatable in-ground air trampoline, go inside a tepee, and play in the park there.  The BEST part was when my little sweetheart hugged me 'out of the blue' as we were leaving and said \"dad, I had the best time today!  Can we come back again?\"  \"Of course we can beautiful... OF COURSE WE CAN!\""}
{"text":"I wish I could do two separate reviews for Mapleside. I guess I could, but I'll just tell you everything in this one.

On a regular week day, I would give this place a 4 star review. It's quaint demeanor, naturally grown produce, and home made delicacies really bring the \"farm\" feel to life. Not to mention the beautiful view over the apple orchards when the sun is setting. The scenery alone is worth heading up there, but be sure to stop and get a buckeye caramel apple. That's right, an apple covered in caramel, peanut butter, AND chocolate. YUM! They make an array of products from pastries to hot sauce and it's all delightful. A tad on the expensive side but so is all organic style produce. The bar in the Orchard House restaurant has a dazzling tree chandelier with glass apples and the comfort food menu compliments the farm motif. It's modern meets country in a style that seems to work for this family business.

Now, all that being said, the festivals are a one or two star rating at best. It is insanely crowded and generally geared towards children. I understand that it's a business that caters to family fun but I was hoping that the Medieval fair would have an \"adult\" draw as well. For someone who doesn't have kids but still enjoys a good fall festival, it's extremely disappointing. I wouldn't even mind the outrageous traffic on Pearl Rd if I was able to enjoy a good joust or sword fight.

I'd love to give this place a great rating, but if you add it all up, it just falls short. Go on a weekday and avoid the festivities."}
{"text":"Hands down a destination visit to Brunswick from the sights and scenery to the concerts over the valley to the newly re-launched bakery inside the \"Apple House\".

My son has a wedding coming up in the summer of 2018, so I will be able to add more later on, however the events the team plan are well run and well worth coming out for.

Very proud that Mapleside has been around for the number of years (I grew up here) and that a family has taken over the farm, we are really lucky to have a place in our city that one would consider a destination."}
{"text":"Went today for a medieval faire...which was not a medieval faire at all.  It was solely a SCA demonstration.  This was fine and entertaining. The only problems I had were the facility and staff itself (non-SCA).  
First, it took a LONG time to park.  Then, you pay $12 a ticket for the \"pumpkin village\", or whatever, which includes a sad park and giant bouncy thing (it's only saving grace).  It was so crowded that this was quite hazardous to play on.  We skipped the rest as this part was so disappointing, I honestly wanted to leave.
Staff is UNHAPPY and they don't care if you know.  They'll scowl at you and your kids, or they have a blank look. The ice-cream vendors were painfully slow and indifferent, even when the customers were happy and greeted THEM.  There were four customers in front of me, ordering one or two cones each, and I waited for almost a half hour for a kiddie cone.  The apple/pumpkin purchasing area was the same way.  The staff clearly did not want to be there.  No smiles, no \"thank-yous\" and no one even said \"enjoy your day\".  
Maybe this place is better in the evenings or something, but we couldn't wait to GTFO.  We practically ran to the car.  This place is a joke.  I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Wine Your Way Out was awesome! Especially since my cousins and I could buy a bottle of wine feature in the maze and enjoy it on a hay ride and around the fire. Very good time! Lots of Fall fun"}
{"text":"OK Mapleside Farms in Brunswick is a great family fun place with lots of activity for families to enjoy, from corn mazes to slides and a pretty cool country store but that's not why I went, two words, Zombie Paintball during October at dusk a  boot camp instructor in fatigues comes out to tell you about the Zombie invasion and then you all pile into a hay carrier that has paintball guns attached to the sides and is pulled by a tractor into the woods. You go down a trail and zombies come out of the woods at regular intervals and you shoot at them until they fall to the ground and die. As a middle aged man shooting a teenager playing a zombie in the head with a paintball gun legally has a great attraction attached to it and I had a blast. It was great fun and I will be doing this again."}
{"text":"Went on October 16 - very beautiful this time of year, definitely a place for kids. For adults, was pricey at $12 to just walk around."}
{"text":"Don't go to the corn cession. Folks are very slow and food was luke warm (pulled Pork).   My family made me eat there much to my regret."}
{"text":"Boy, what a difference October 31st makes!  Prior to Halloween, Mapleside is jam-packed with people milling about.  Now that it's November, I could almost hear crickets!  

This year they expanded the children's play area so it now includes this amazing bouncing pillow and more things to crawl over.  Plus, there is a real corn maze to try!  

There are big differences between this year and last year.  I heard there was new ownership and it seems like they're doing an excellent job.  The store is a little less packed with trinkets no one needs anyway, but they offer the same pumpkins, apples and pies that you'd normally expect.

I also stopped into the bar for happy hour.  We had some great Xmas ale drafts for $3.50 (not Great Lakes) and normal drafts are just $2.  We ordered the pulled pork nachos which were really very impressive for $5!  I wasn't especially hungry and they came piled high.  Near the end, every chip I ate I kept saying out loud \"I'm so full...but I just can't stop!\"

So I left Mapleside with Xmas ale in my belly and a delicious peck of apples.  No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Note:  this review is about their special events, not the restaurant.

Beautiful venue to watch a sunset concert on a Friday night.  Concert tickets are bargain prices to watch local cover bands.  It is truly beautiful to watch the sunset over the hills.

Bathrooms are portable johns and as it gets dark, you can't see inside them.  Yuck! No lights.

Food was just okay at the concession stands.  No outside food or drink permitted.  Prices were reasonable."}
