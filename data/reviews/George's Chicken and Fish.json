{"text":"Fantastic FRIED CHICKEN and so much more. This is one of the best restaurant that I have tried here in Sun Prairie. The place is very busy so it would be better to order ahead of time if you are going to pick it up. The restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly. They aim to please."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere, walked in and was greeted by multiple employees! Don't go in if you're in a hurry because this will take awhile. George's has a very large menu and I had the 4 wing meal, these were whole wings with fries and a soda for a fair price! It's a small place located in the first Porktropolis spot and I hope there not jinxed cause they got good down home cooking. I'll be back to sample some more stuff."}
{"text":"First, let me offer the caveat that as I write this review, George's Chicken & Fish has been in operation for roughly 2 weeks. I don't expect that a family business, never having been in the restaurant industry before, could work out all the kinks in the span of 2 weeks. This place has promise, and I want to see them succeed. Every patron is greeted with the salutation \"Welcome to George's\" from the waitstaff as they walk through the door.

The food we ordered was good. We placed a rather large order, because I wanted to try a little of everything. The fried cheese curds were among the best we've ever had. Fried Okra was so-so. The chicken Philly Cheesesteak was huge and flavorful. An order of 4 chicken wings was slightly disappointing, in that they were some of the smallest chicken wings I've ever seen. The batter was tasty and they were done to perfection, they just left me wanting more. 

George's offers catfish, cod, and ocean perch, which I look forward to trying on a future visit. Fried chicken offerings are limited to wings, legs, and thighs. A fried chicken breast, as of this writing, was not to be found on the menu, a disappointment for those who aren't fans of dark chicken meat. 

Try the collard geens and mac & cheese as a side. Both very tasty, although the collards were heavily salted. Several home-made desserts are offered as well.

Now, for the reality check. George's service is chaotic, at best. I'm hoping they find a \"flow\" to their kitchen, because there was no apparent order of operations on the day of our visit. We were there at a time that the place wasn't particularly busy. Perhaps this will improve over time. This should not prevent you from giving the place a try. For larger orders, consider calling ahead to place your order. They do require payment when you place the order.

If you are waiting for your order, George's is clean and well-lit, and there are two big-screens for your viewing pleasure."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised! We ordered takeout from George's, a tiny, unassuming restaurant. The catfish was delightfully crisp and tasty. The fries were also crisp; the chicken wings were delicious. Mac n cheese was fabulous. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"We went for a Friday fish fry with eagerness to have discovered a local gem. Unfortunately the food left those expectations far short. The fish is pre packaged & way over cooked and dry. Frankly an Arby's fish sandwich would have been a step up!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after driving last a few weeks ago.  Like Porktropolis that was in this location before George's the atmosphere/interior isn't much to write about, but that's not why you come here.  Service was friendly and while it took a little while, it's worth the wait.  

The food is excellent!  I ordered the two filet/two wing meal because I wanted to try both the fish and chicken.  Both were great with some of the best breading I've had.  It also travelled well for the 10min drive home without becoming soggy.  The seasoning is very flavorful and good. 

It says that every meal comes with fries and drink but that undersells it a little.  I also got a small thing of very good coleslaw (and I love good coleslaw!) and two pieces of lightly toasted white bread.  All that along with a good portion of well cooked fries.  

Overall, a little more food than I needed for lunch but I wasn't sure what to expect since it was my first visit.  Everything tasted great and really seemed like it was prepared by people who care about their food!  I'll be going back.  I doubt I'll ever go and not order their fish, but I definitely want to try some of their sides...collared greens and hush puppies next time for sure."}
{"text":"Been there twice now. First time I had the chicken tenders which were ok, but a little dry and nothing special. Second time I had the Italian beef and OMG! That is exactly the way it should always be. Bread sturdy, but soaked in delicious juices. Could have done with the hot peppers being a little hotter if I want to nitpick. If you're ok with Faygo in the can or water then c9me and dat here. Good prices for some great food."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch after hearing about them today. I was very happy with my Philly cheesesteak and though the bread it was on was delicious. The fries were good too. They're still working out some kinks in the kitchen, which is to be expected this early on. 

I really hope they succeed and appreciate a southern food joint trying to join the Sun Prairie dining scene.  I read in the Star that they're adding customer's requests to their menu to please people. I'm excited to watch them grow!"}
{"text":"Great service. I usually grade very hard for interior atmosphere comfort and Lighting. This place is not the greatest but the food makes up for that. I had a chicken dish with rice it was unlike anything I ever had before. I thought my mother was back in the kitchen. This is home cooking and you should go there and get some while you can."}
{"text":"If you like REAL southern cooking, you have to try George's.  There aren't many places in the Wisconsin where you'll find okra, collard greens and hush puppies.  But these are just some of the sides.  The star of this place, in my opinion is the chicken.  I had a wing and thigh the first time I was here, but just tried the dry rub wings.  They were to die for.  I did get a side of barbeque sauce to put on them, but really didn't need it.  The crispiness and seasoning were perfect!

George's is a small family run restaurant, and they are friendly and eager to please.  It is not fancy, you order at the counter, and the food is brought out to you.  I plan to go back, as there were many things on the menu I still want to try."}
{"text":"Real southern cooking! Okra, gizzards, collard greens, sweet potato pie, catfish, hush puppies and more! It's nothing fancy but who needs fancy when the food is delicious. Everything is cooked to order so expect to wait a little while,but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The staff is incredibly nice, the prices and value are amazing, and the food is excellent.

You should be warned, this does take a bit if you don't order ahead.  Freshly breaded fried chicken isn't quick.  And if you eat like, which many don't, it will be a lot of salt by the time you're done so plan some hydration.

I ordered a 2-piece chicken, a Chicago style polish, and a catfish/perch combo.  They all came with fries, soda, and bread.  The fries were larger with soft insides and totaled over a pound.  The chicken and fish were fried perfectly, nice, hot, crunchy.  Now, the polish is NOT a Chicago dog.  If that is what you're after, it will not be what you get.  It was very good, but be mindful in your expectations.

Now, I don't remember what I ended up spending, but it wasn't any more than an average lunch somewhere.  And with what I ate, that is very inexpensive.

Highly recommend coming here.  They are true to what they do and it shows."}
{"text":"Chicken and Fish were both good. Fries have a tasty seasoning on them. The greens were not bad by any means but not a highlight. There was a lot of \"staff\" there and seemed a little chaotic/unorganized. I would go back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"This places is a joke. Tried last week. All it is is frozen food deep fried. The hush puppies were burnt. The shrimp was tough. The fries were okay. Than faygo pop choices. Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Affordable comfort food right at my fingertips! Very good chicken and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check out George's after hearing a commercial for them on the radio. And we were very happy we did. The lady taking our order was very friendly and patient with us. It's a small place but there was no problem finding a place to sit. They bring out the food to you, which is nice. I ordered the 2 pc cod and it was perfectly cooked. My boyfriend had the 10 pc wing and said they were really good as well. The portions are a little small for the price, but I definitely think it's worth it. Although we live on the west side of Madison, we will definitely be making the trip back here."}
