{"text":"Good food, great mashed potatoes and great service. Located in  a small strip mall in Dorval, this is a charming breakfast joint. They sever lunch too from Mon-Fri, but never has the opportunity to sample thier fare. Their breakfast is really good, including the ususal eggs and meats, however they have some smashing waffle/pancake and fruit plates. Go you must try it, you will not be disppointed."}
{"text":"The eggs we so under cooked they were still clucking The bacon was soaked in grease The plate had some dried up fruit  on it Then I spent the rest of the day with severe stomach cramps and diarrhea  At least it was very expensive I will never go there again"}
{"text":"Very bad quality, the service was good but food was terrible and way too expensive. Unfortunately, there is no good place for breakfast in Dorval. Not quality"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! 2 kinds of potatoes, both incredible and you can top them with melted cheese. The portions are very generous. The plates are perfectly decorated. I had the benedict a la George, I can't stop talking about it to everyone. Best benedict I've ever had. My friend had a huge french crepe stuffed with fruit, beautiful! Must try."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast and friendly staff all at reasonable prices. Plenty of things on the menu."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here a few times. Very good selection. Also many lunch specials. Everything is around $10-$15, but portions are big and tasty. Service is fast. Good place to go in Dorval."}
{"text":"Place over rated, over packed.after we ordered by 15 mins, we been told they have no salmon.then we had to wait 15 more mins to get the food.the omlet was less than average.Nothing stands out....they need more wait staff. Waiter came literally 3 times to the table!!!! They also have no ranch!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the French toast.  Definitely not what a French toast Should taste like  there was just no flavor.  No wonder the place was so dead.  Yes it looked good with layers of chocolate drizzled on top and fruits but the toast itself was tasteless.  I would not go back"}
{"text":"Really Good!! Mashed potatoes are awesome!!! Waiters are friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"I find there good but was better when they first started. They are slowly loosing the quality of there meals I pray that they keep the quality up if not their gonna loose in the end. Me and aprox 10 other dorvalers no longer go there but would quickly come back if they could make a quick fix on the small details."}
{"text":"Love this breakfast spot! The people are super sweet and they get to know you quick if you go there more than once.   It's not a fancy breakfast place so unlike some reviewers who were surprised by this, you shouldn't expect top quality, beautifully decorated plates. It's well priced for the food you get, if not better priced for the plate size!   My mom and I's go to spot on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Used Yelp to find a fairly priced breakfast spot and opted on this joint. was so good the first time we went back for a second. The pics uploaded are what ya get. Big portions, great \"round\" potatoes. Our first visit,  we had eggs and split a crepe. It was huge and very tasty (bananas,  strawberries,  English cream and chocolate). The waitress was very attentive. Second visit, I had the good morning.  Eggs, bacon, potatoes and a waffle with some fruits. Only reason I did not give 5 stars,  waiter was not as good as the girl from the first time. Place was packed first time, and not even half full the second trip. Owner or manager was also friendly.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot with a menu similar to Cora's or some of the other breakfast spots.   Eggs were perfect, runny as orders. Baked beans were good well well. Decent value as well."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant !! Whenever we come to Canada , we come here for brunch . Best crepes ! Enjoy their omelettes too . Their fried potatoes are yummy !  What really is also very super-special is the staff . Katerina is awesome ! She takes good care of us each time we come here. Her smile is so captivating!   Joanne is very , very friendly and helpful . Has charisma! Katerina and Joanne are keepers!"}
{"text":"Food is good. What can you ask for other than that for breakfast. I had their Sicilian omelette and loved it. Would have been 5 stars if the food was a little bit warmer."}
{"text":"The food was good. About on par with your typical breakfast joint, but what got me was the service. This place runs like a well oiled machine. Came in to a line that moved quick. Food came out quick and hot! You can see the servers hustling. Definitely a good place to grab a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Well I shouldn't have turn left and gone here. I was initially going to Tim hortons and now I wish I would have gone there.   You know I when the food is bland when you need to drown it in salt.  Dirty plates, waitresses English was so broken that I begged her to speak French since I understand French.   Beans and cretons taste canned, bacon is cold. Waffles was from a package. Food is served too fast because it's not made from scratch.  Coffee nasty and I was going to eat my last bite of frozen sausage and decided to leave it there.  Erk!!! Everythin on my plate and that of my wife tastes nasty all together.   I will never come here again!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Large portions, delicious food, and friendly service. Wish we lived here, we would frequently come here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast resto. Love it! If you're walking by the strip for a Tim Horton's breakfast but have got some time, keep walking a bit and try Eggsclusif! Delicious."}
{"text":"We came here before heading into Montreal for the day. I checked out the menu prior to our visit and it basically sold me. The crepes were appealing and there was plenty for the hubby to pick from.   Service was average to slightly below average. Could have been a little bit more friendly, pleasant. The food was okay, the crepe was a bit disappointing. The flavor was off, I would have preferred to have it warm over cold so that the cream cheese had melted a bit. The fruits served with it were yummy and worked well with the granola that was on top of the crepes. The husband enjoyed his food other than finding a single bit of onion in his cheesy mashed potatos and he thought the sausage tasted odd. We were thinking this might have been just a different take on sausage than we are used to in the states.   Overall, it was decent but I will probably not return."}
{"text":"Tried this breakfast joint this morning for the first time as it is conveniently close to my work. First impressions, fairly clean but dated; seems they haven't improve their decor since they first opened years ago. I was nicely welcome by bearded gentleman who assigned me a booth (bench) which is quite stiff, back part is straightly vertical and its textile looks dated like the rest of the place. But I keep my hope up cuz some of the sketchiest places have the best food, right? So I order plain 2 over easy eggs and bacon, nothing fancy. Wait is about 8 minutes. Plate looks decent with right amount of fried potatoes and 3 slices of fruits and about 5 slices of bacon which is pretty generous. Potatoes are slightly spiced,  although I prefer them crunchier (would have asked well done if I would have known).  Eggs are just on the edge of being browned but they make the cut and taste fine as expected. Toast were evenly buttered and toasted just right. Once done with the main course, I attack the 3 fruits slices to discover a hair under them... yuck. I didn't make a scene as I am very uncomfortable and I am waiting for water to ask me how was meal but he never asked. Still left a tip but won't be back here anytime soon... 2 stars for the hair in plate."}
{"text":"I could describe this place with one sound \"Meh\".  Service was slow, French toast was a cake, and the food was ok. The dessert breakfasts are good but that's it."}
{"text":"Diner feel but is located in a small plaza with other shops.  Wait time was short for the Sunday breakfast hour.    Menu has plenty of above average breakfast and brunch style options.  Light bites or a fully loaded breakfast platter.  Service was swift and pleasant.  Food was nicely presented and tasteful.  Definitely a place to consider for routine visits even though a Tim Hortons is located next door."}
{"text":"The cook undercooked my eggs by a little and the manager caught onto it without me mentionning anything. He brought me new eggs with two extra pieces of ham and even deducted a 25% off our total bill. This seriously is the best service I have ever received. Also, I strongly suggest trying their mashed potatoes with both mozarella and cheddar!"}
{"text":"Typical breakfast place..typical menu...nice and friendly servers..however..i gave only 3 stars because : not once but TWICE..i had a hair on my plate of food..I'm not turned off by this ..mistakes  happen and i know no one would do it on purpose ..but twice is pretty unlucky.. So get the hairnets out people! I will go back due to convenience and the staff are friendly.."}
{"text":"I've been 4-5 times now so I think it's time to write a quick review.  First off- huge portions! I can barely dent what they give me (not a complaint!) Everything from the portion of side potatoes to the side fruit garnish....they put other brunch places to shame!  I don't find the food really consistent in how it's served (Mickey mouse shaped pancakes the 1st time- not the next. Eggs Benny drowned in Hollandaise, served perfectly the next time), but overall I like their food and will try a few more options on the menu when I generally don't at other places. Timing of tables has me a bit thrown too. I've gone the same day, same time all 5 times and sometimes the line is out the door and sometimes you are seated immediately. Overall I do really like it for a brunch place closer to Lachine and it's pretty much the closest one to me (so says Yelp when I search) so I'll keep going back once and awhile :)"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast joint in a little strip mall.  Everything prepared well with very nice presentation.  Huge portions, excellent choices including a lunch menu some days.  Staff is pleasant and very efficient as well as completely bilingual.  I'll be back next visit to Dorval."}
{"text":"Came here with my family because my family member loves the eggs Benedict. And I have to say when I tried his benny it was pretty good! I ordered the veggie omelette with side waffle, my omelette was good but I think it could've used some salt and pepper and the waffle was a bit dry. I liked that they give a good amount of fruit on the side of the plate, oh and the freshly squeezed OJ was bomb!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot. Menu is in both English and French and it's full of fabulousness. We had a super French Toast but there's something for everyone. Smoothies and fresh squeezed juice too!"}
