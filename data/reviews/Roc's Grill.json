{"text":"Had dinner here with my family recently. The food was excellent all around. The sharing plates are the perfect size for a group of 3 to eat as an appetizer. Even the deserts were good! The table was very clean and the wait times were reasonable for such fresh cooked food."}
{"text":"Great contemporary twist to the Filipino food, but for me the lack of seasoning is a deal breaker to fully appreciate the Filipino taste. I highly recommend the Beef Bulalo, Sisig, Grilled Liempo, Sizzling Caldereta and Garlic rice. 

As for drinks and desserts, try the Black Gulaman drink, Sylvanas, and the Chocolate Yema cake are a must.

Overall, I might come back for the 3rd time, but not for a while."}
{"text":"I ordered the wings and I was food poisoned. I was sick for days.  They should just keep the menu simple and real Filipino food."}
{"text":"First impressions are good and I am going back. 

Roc's Grill is a clean, nice and inviting \"hole in the wall\" in Woodbine. I have no knowledge whatsoever as to this type of food but dove in. 

I ordered the \"Sizzling Caldereta\".  It is a sizzling beef stew platter that is slightly spicy. The server recommended garlic rice, which was terrific.  Simply put, it surpassed all expectations.  The dish was delicious, and even better with a cold beer from their menu.  

The problem I will have is exploring the menu now that I know they have a dish that is so amazing. 

I will add to this as a I go, but in the meantime give it a try."}
{"text":"The service is wonderful, everyone is so nice. The place is very clean and the decor is nice. The food is great and the serving is pretty big but the price is very affordable. I will recommend this restaurant to my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! It's an awesome gateway restaurant to Filipino food as the mixture of flavours and styles of dishes blend western and Filipino tastes and help ease you into the more exotic Filipino dishes. Also, GREAT selection of Filipino desserts - fantastic halo halo, a must try!"}
{"text":"I won't be back. Can't recommend this place. I ordered sisig and it arrived warm. Nothing on this plate was hot.
The spring rolls were piping hot and actually tasted fresh. Maybe the main chef was off and his apprentice was covering for him while getting over a cold. Just no.
The halo-halo was on point. Can't really mess this one up.. just dump all the ingredients in a cup and add a spoon. 
I won't be back and can't recommend this place to anyone I care about."}
{"text":"Great place close to home in Woodbine. The service is excellent and very helpful if you don't know where to start with the menu. The adoboy pork or chicken is fantastic. Tried the kare-kare chicken and beef bicolex with garlic rice. All came recommended and did not dissapoint! Encourage all to stop by this hidden gem in SW Calgary."}
{"text":"Good location, nice place, good food, great service. The pork belly can be inconsistent but overall a good experience and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is my second time dining here. I must say, when I first visited this restaurant I felt so much much welcomed by the staff. The place has a \"cottage like\" feel to it (which I LOVE). 

Food brings back childhood memories and still has the consistency of Filipino cuisine! A must try!

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Nice family-owned Filipino restaurant. Excellent food. Friendly service. Family atmosphere. 

We had no experience with Filipino food. However the waitress walked us through the menu and gave us good advice. She was clearly informed about ingredients and preparation. 

Thanks to our friends Luis and Cecilia for recommending Roc's Grill. We will be back."}
{"text":"Their pancit (noodles) is good! I also love their siding. We pre ordered so we didn't have an issue on the service. My husband loves their fried pampano (fish). Try their lechon poutine!"}
{"text":"This is the best Filipino restaurant we've found in the city by a long margin. Better than 7 Seas, better than Max's that just opened. Calderetta, Pacit, Lechon were all on point. Bring your family here and fill their bellies. Just call ahead to reserve a table because the dining area is small and this place is busy. Do it. You'll thanks me later."}
{"text":"It was definitely a surprise to find a Filipino restaurant so far south but this place is definitely worth the trip! The menu is a very edited selection of Filipino dishes with some fusion style dishes. We started with the kare kare chicken wings. The wings were very large and the sauce was fantastic! We actually kept the sauce for our rice later on! I shared the crispy pata and garlic rice which has a lot of crispy pork skin but not as much meat. The rest of my party also had the chicken inasal with atsara and the house pancit which they seemed to enjoy. We tried an assortment of desserts: the leche flan and the yema cake were my favourite!

Service was fairly prompt given that the restaurant was full. The price for the meal and desserts for 5 was under 150$ including tip which is awesome! There is lots of parking out front and the bathrooms are very clean. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"We came here for thanksgiving with the whole family. We had reserved seats so we were seated quickly. The restaurants did not seem busy, but the service was a bit slow.

We ordered a fair bit of food, and they all came in little bit at a time, which was spaced over an hour period. In my opinion that is quite slow. As in filipino dinning you usually have your rice accompanied with your main entrees. We received our rice first - and then got our first entree 15 minutes later, then our second entree 15 minutes later again, and then the 3rd and 4th being spaced at least 15 minutes apart. 

The main entrees were great, although the servings were quite small. The appetizers we ordered were great as well, our family really liked the kare kare wings. The desserts on the other hand were a bit of a let down. Their cakes were so dry, the ube with ice cream was weird, and the leche flan was nothing special.

Overall, I'm not totally convince that I can recomend Roc's grill as I didn't truly like it or hate it. I think I would come back again for the kare kare wings, but nothing else."}
