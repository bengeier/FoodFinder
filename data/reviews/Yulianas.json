{"text":"Love this place.  Always stop in for Menudo or Adobada"}
{"text":"I love their carne asada fries and my daughter their quesadillas. We also love their horchata we are very picky with horchata."}
{"text":"We moved across the street last year and we're so glad we found this place! Price is great for the amount of food that you get"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Excellent Horchata. We moved here from SanFrancisco awhile ago and had been looking for a Mission Style burrito for my son. This is as close as we can get. We have had the Carne Asada, chicken burritos, quesadilla, fajitas. All were excellent."}
{"text":"Moving from SoCal to Florence I was disappointed with our Mexican food choices... until I found Yuliana's! Sooooo yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Great food but for takeout only.   The inside is not much to look at.   The food is delicious and authentic.  A true gem for the area."}
{"text":"All I'm going to say is \"true Mexican food!\" This place is delicious. It's not fancy by any means but that's the magic behind this place. A hole in the wall restaurant where the food speaks for itself. The employees are friendly as well. If you want a taste of Mexico, then come here!"}
{"text":"Not super impressed with this place. If you are looking for quick Mexican then it's one step up from Taco Bell. We had nachos and 4 tacos for $20. With all the good Mexican around, not sure we will be back to this place."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hours they post. I showed up here at 945pm to get a meal for the first time and they had the doors locked. There was a lady at the cash register and when I knocked on the door, she didn't even acknowledge my presence. After I kept knocking, she looked up, looked back down and kept at whatever she was doing. If this is how y'all treat customers, I'm glad I didn't try your food. Complete trash customer service. Smh."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos.good price great taste and love the green salsa!authentic Mexican feel."}
{"text":"Yulianas is a convenient place to do take out and I believe most people choose to do take out. They do have booths to eat at if you would like to take your food to a table and eat. I don't believe they provide complimentary chips and salsa, but that's ok since we hardly ever eat there. In general, they food is pretty good and the prices are average. Of the many times we've gotten food from here, there was only one time that they slightly messed up the order by charging me for extra tortillas but forgetting to put them in the bag (it happens). If you're looking to take home some Mexican Food tonight and live nearby, this place is an acceptable option."}
{"text":"I stop by here on my way home from work and I really do enjoy the food and hospitality! The prices aren't bad either, also I really enjoy the hospitality of this one gal whose always been there when I'm there and we've had great hospitality. Also I just want to mention their food tastes very fresh which makes the prices even more better! I will be continuing to stop by as long as I live in the area and so should other people!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the price is nice. The service is quick. I usually order over the phone before I head there and it's ready by the time I get there."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for being open on Sunday! Restaurant very clean and service was with a smile. Food was was good but a little Bland. Otherwise great experience and will be back. Add a little bit more flavor and you'll be a five-star."}
{"text":"Best Mexican fast food place around. Their hot sauce is the best you will find and hot!!!  For breakfast ask for the egg, bacon and potato with cheese burrito. Promise you will have one every week!!"}
{"text":"Yuliana's has the best breakfast burritos in Gilbert after my long lost search for a decent breakfast burrito my search finally came to an end after finding Yuliana's. This place is a total hole in the wall tucked away in a stripmall that I have passed several times and never  noticed. Prices here are great, service is quick, menu is decent and place is clean not much more you can ask for."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best ground beef burrito I have ever had! I crave it! Service is always good and the prices are more than reasonable! Love this place"}
{"text":"We just saw this and stopped in for a quick and last minute Dinner instead of going home and cooking and I have to tell you, that we did not got disappointed. Really good food, nice lady and very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Love their food. Love their green salsa. Quick and always seem to be open which is nice. I always get the simple stuff which is a bean and cheese burrito and it never fails on being good. Their rice is just perfect too. They are always super quick."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a week. Best Mexican food we have found in along time! Customer service and food is always top notch. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food quality is 4 stars.  Tortillas are 5 stars, but for the price they get an overall 5th star.  Great family operation.  We had the breakfast burritos and a shredded chicken burrito."}
{"text":"We have now been here on multiple occasions and have loved everything we've ordered. Their breakfast burritos are delicious and can feed more than 1 person. My favorite has been the quesadilla supreme. The carne asada is flavorful and the addition of the beans inside makes it a complete meal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When you're craving shredded beef tacos, chicken enchiladas, arroz y frijoles, Yuliana's will satisfy. The food tastes like what you'd expect to find at a decent sit-down Mexican restaurant in AZ, but they do it quickly and at fair prices. In Gilbert, there's not a huge selection of authentic tasting taco shops, so Yuliana's is a great find.  My favorite item here is the shredded beef crispy taco. Take a look at their combo list and you're sure to find something you like. My daughter loves the rice and beans, preferably mixed up together. The rest of my family usually eats the cheese enchiladas.    The only real drawback is that the interior is somewhat lacking in aesthetic. It's not the kind of place where you'd hunker down for chips and salsa while listening to a mariachi band before your entree arrives. This is a \"Mexican food stat\" type establishment. So, get your items to go and listen to your own mariachi music at home.   After reading other reviews, I'm looking forward to trying a burrito in the future. Until then, salud!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! This food chain is compatible to filibertos and los favorites HOWEVER, the freshness of their ingredients is incomparable. Delicious Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Great food - Arizona Burrito is way better than Filbertos. The green sauce is awesome!"}
{"text":"I don't know what there food is like, I didn't get that far.  Between the rudeness of the cashier and a simple street taco costing $3 (what I came for) I decided to leave while I was ahead."}
{"text":"Yes the food is authentic, doesn't mean it's delicious. The plus is the cashier is nice and the prices were good. But the food is barely decent, and this is coming from a Hispanic person that cooks and eats it almost every day. You can tell they cut corners by not having a salsa bar and having the water plus water cups behind the counter. The food was kind of cold. Mucha Lucha is not far from here, I recommend going there!"}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst. My husband got the cheese enchiladas and the cheese inside was not even melted, pretty disappointing. I got the rolled tacos and they were good. As usual with most of these places the beans and rice are in need of seasoning, and the salsa is mostly spice and not much flavor. The chips however are excellent!"}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall Mexican food in the area.  I've tried a couple of things but the chicken tacos are my favorite - crunchy shells stuffed with savory chicken. The rice is also especially tasty, I like that they add a little veggies to jazz it up."}
{"text":"Good food. Went here for the first time today. Mom got the wrapped tacos and I got a bean and cheese burrito!  The chips and dip were very good. I will definitely give it another try!"}
{"text":"6:20am on a Sunday morning is not the best time to find a place open in Mesa for breakfast. I'm shine my elation when I found a four star reviewed Mexican place that was not only open but not too far out of my way to pick up a delicious breakfast burrito. On arrival the place looked a little dark. I was hoping that was for atmosphere. I was actually feeling a bit excited at the prospect of a new place I haven't eaten at and my stomach was growling in anticipation of some fluffy eggs, salty bacon, melty cheddar cheese, and salsa all wrapped up in a warm flour tortilla. Unfortunately someone forgot to get up on time and failed to open this morning. I would have allowed 5-10 minutes late. Stuff happens. But almost a half hour late? No pass given."}
{"text":"The Mexican food here was great! Everything I have got has been well prepared and fresh! From the the rolled tacos to the breakfast burritos never over fried or over cooked with great flavor!!"}
{"text":"Let's call this what it is, a dive restaurant. And yet it probably the closest thing to Mexican food in SE Gilbert.   It's not Chipotle, Costa Vida or Rio so don't expect that.  What you can expect is Mexican food that is good, reasonably priced and good."}
{"text":"This place lost my business today. I called to order five tacos, four of them being flour tortilla. The girl then proceeded to tell me that they are going to be charging $.50 per flour taco. I was so upset at this price gouge that I told her to cancel my order and they lost me as a customer. She tried to then say they would only charge me $.25 and after I complained again & she said we won't charge me at all for the tortillas and I still told her I didn't want to order the food. I've never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging $.50 for ordering a flour tortilla. My guess is they are hurting for money and need to up charge their already expensive menu. Too bad because their food was good."}
{"text":"The taco and enchilada combo I had was pretty good and inexpensive. The beef taco was just a little better than the cheese enchilada the only thing the place was lacking is a salsa bar the customer service was good so I'll return to try something new."}
{"text":"My favorite go to Mexican food place! Affordable, quick, and delicious! Their chicken taco, cheese quesadilla, and chips with salsa are my personal favorites!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Yuliana's today after the restaurant we had hoped to eat at was closed Sundays. What a nice surprise! Lots of menu choices that you order at the counter - and everything seemed to be homemade. We both had #15 - carne asada with crunchy taco shells. The shells were super crispy and the meat was great! I loved that they automatically put guacamole on the tacos and no \"extra charge\" bs. The rice and beans were really good too! We will definitely be going back soon:)"}
{"text":"Great go to. Solid tacos and burritos.  Reasonable prices and good hours. Try the Arizona burrito with steak and potatoes"}
{"text":"Good prices and well worth the food... Service was quick and polite.... Free refills of soda!!!!"}
{"text":"I moved to the area recently and have been looking for real Mexican food. I frequent Costa Vida and Cafe Rio, but sometimes need the real deal. I was so excited when I found this place. The tacos were delicious and had a lot of meat! I was impressed. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try time after time but disappointed every single time .waited to order food in two different occasions for about 10 mins and was completely ignored both times !!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They struggled with service about 6 months ago but the two employees that were consistently not friendly are gone. They are quick and the food is great! I'd recommend the Arizona burrito or their Pollo Asado has great flavor as well"}
{"text":"I walked in to place an order, no others in line. The phone rings after I get in line. The guy walks out of the back and picks up be phone takes an order. Then he gives an order to a waiting customer.  The phone rings again, he picks it up (apologizes) and takes another order. Now I place my order. You would think he knows how to put someone on hold for a minute. For gods sake, there is a live person in your restaurant before the phone rings."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. No Bueno & no salsa bar or hot carrots!  Prices do seem reasonable. I can sure say ; \"Looked better than it tasted\". Tacos ( chicken & beef) bland in flavor.  They offer two salsas in containers: a green which is ok & a red that taste of the plastic bottles it's squeezed from. Refried beans good ( I'm sure they're made with lard) LOL The rice was just plan average. Bathroom ( unisex) is filthy! I tried this spot, won't be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while now! Love this place very clean custom service is great. They know me by name.  Food is so delicious only Mexican restaurant I eat at!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here two weeks and pretty sure I've eaten here 5 times. I get the carne Asada burrito and the shredded beef crispy taco. Very good! I have had the steak and egg burrito as well and also excellent. Love the green salsa."}
{"text":"This is the first time coming into your business!  I had a taco/ enchiladas combo.  The service was quick and the food was fantastic!  After words I went in to use the restroom, it was very clean.  I will be returning to this fantastic business."}
{"text":"We had a few different things here on our first visit: 2 breakfast burritos: bacon, egg, bean, & cheese AND a chorizo, bacon, been and cheese. Both where excellent. Only reason they didn't get 5 stars was the salsa had a strange taste.   They had a steady flow of people coming in on a early Sunday afternoon. The dining area was very clean and the young lady that took our order was very pleasant. Next time I'll use my own hot sauce/ salsa."}
{"text":"This place is good the AZ burrito is good.  Think of this place as a less expensive Los Favoritos. I would Definitely recommend this place to friend."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service.  I had a shredded beef taco and bean and cheese burrito (my usual).  They had lots of cheese and lettuce on the taco.  Burrito was great.  Glad they are fairly close to my house!  Restaurant was clean.  I will be back!"}
