{"text":"A great restaurant with children's playhouse and great Bangladeshi, Indian food. If you are visiting Toronto, you will miss the ambience of Toronto if you don't visit this place. They have weekend breakfast special where I had to stand for 30 minutes to get in. And we were not disappointed at all for the long wait. The breakfast special was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Went there during the summer, but wasn't impressed much. 
And, then heard about the change of management/ownership. So sneaked in recently twice:
First, went for their breakfast special on a Saturday morning around 11:00 am (they serve it only on Saturday & Sunday). The thali (plate) contains 2 luchis (ia deep-fried flatbread made of wheat flour), goat/chicken liver (little spicy), halwa suji, cooked lentil or vegetable. The portion was mid size. The luchis were freshly made, hot. In fact, all the items seemed to be fresh and delicious. 

The next weekend, we went back for lunch after a soccer game. It was a small group of us. My brother ordered Khichuri-Beef Curry. I went for their Tehari. We shared the foods to get the taste of both dishes. I guess, I liked Khichuri-Beef Curry more. Teheri was a bit blant. But, the good part was, none of the dishes were too oily and the portion was decent for the price. I also tried their Polau-Roast dish. Hands down the best Roast I had in a while! 

The new management took over the place very recently (late November). They are still working on the interior design and arrangements. I met two of the owners and they are really cordial and customer oriented. The best part is, they are eager to know customers' feedback to keep trying to improve in all aspects. Kudos to that!!! 

Heard they are going to bring Kacchi Biryani soon! Will go back to taste that soon.

P.S. they have limited parking. I actually parked the side road on beside Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Good food but very inconsistent from 1 week to the next. Only the weekend specials seem to be consistent. Good service though."}
{"text":"I am a great fan of Biryani and always would like to try new places. Tried the mutton biryani as taking out. The place was clean and service was quick compared to other restaurants around. I am satisfied with the aroma and taste. Would highly recommend for authentic and South Asian food lovers. My recommendation is to make the place more bright and make the washroom more hygiene."}
{"text":"First visit and enjoyed quite a lot. However, always room for improvement. They can brush up the ambiance more, add a bit of warmth to the decor, makes it more inviting. Food was very good. Enjoyed a variety of dishes, luchi, paratha, dal mangsho, Chana dal, chicken korai, Lamb biryani, shobji labra, shuji halwa, egg omelet.  I'll rate the food 4/5.  They can do slight adjustments to make improvements. Ease up on the oil, food will still be great in taste, just not as heavy. Serve a raita with the biryani. And offering a salsa type salad would also be a nice addition to balance the rich curries. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food. If you're looking for authentic Bangladeshi food, this is your to go place. Ever since the new management took over since November, their effort to keep the place clean, friendly and improve the food quality has been exceptional. Great customer service. 

If you are not familiar with Bangladeshi food, you should always try out the Fuchka and Chicken Roast with Polao. Believe me there won't be any regrets. Their bhuna khichuri with your choice of curry (Chicken or Beef) will also impress you. I wasn't too impressed with their Teheri the last time I had it, but it might just be one timer.

They also have breakfast menu on the weekend with Parata/Luchi, Halua, Cow Kolija/Liver, Daal, which seemed to be one of the best Bangladeshi traditional breakfast you can find around. I don't recommend taking the vegetable, as it wasn't up to our expectations."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and I was impressed by the service and food quality.  Had their chicken roast, paratha  and fuchka. Chicken roast was amazing !!"}
{"text":"It was standard affair Bangladeshi comfort food. Decent portions at a fair price. 

I got the Khichuri with bhuna gosh and found the khichuri a bit dried out.
Also got the Biryani- which was pretty decent but nothing rich tasting and the chicken was overcooked and dried out a well. Maybe cuz i went later around 9 pm, so the food didnt taste as fresh as possible

Their highlight is definitely the chicken roast. Was delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some of the tastiest curries I've had in recent times!  It's a bit out of the way at Danforth Road and Danforth Avenue area but it's worth the trip.  We ordered the bhuna khichuri with chicken curry and enjoyed every last mouthful.  The chicken was very tender and fell off the bone.  I've had Bangladeshi food in other places but have to say this place is by far the best!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurant in north america for sub continental food- especially Bengali. Awsome food with great price. We live in New York but whenever travel to Toronto - this is our place to go for. The service is outstanding which is rare for most of the sub continental restaurants in Canada or USA. My 5 year son loved thair weekend breakfast. Lastly- dont forget to try their Tehari (rice with small pieces of meat)."}
{"text":"Woohoo! Another cuisine I can cross off my foodie bucket list. 

Cafe De Taj is in a tiny plaza on the corner of Danforth Ave. and Danforth Rd. As soon as I walked in I could smell some amazing cook working their kitchen magic with some exotic spices AH YES! 

Pretty roomy with booths and tables good for big groups, and even a playroom for the kiddos. Simple decor but I loved the texture and design of the walls in the dining room and women's washroom.

Told the hostess/waitress/cashier I've never tried Bangladeshi food before so she suggested the Chicken Roast+Polau+(hard boiled) Egg and the Bhuna Khichuri + Beef. So grateful they had free Wifi to keep me busy during the short wait. 

Tried the Chicken Roast first. Oh my! It was absolutely delicious! There were two pieces of tender chicken covered in a thick, delectable, medium spicy sauce; hubby and I devoured it all! The Pulao (rice pilaf) was bland and I didn't care for the hard boiled egg. Next was the Bhuna Khichuri + Beef; it was just ok. The beef was swimming in oil, so I had to fish out the chunks and put them on top of the Bhuna Khichuri (rice and lentils). The Beef was totally overshadowed by the chicken roast. Next time I will order the Chicken roast with the more flavorful Bhuna Khichuri rice.

I will be back to try out more menu items so I can bump up their rating, but in the meantime I'll give it a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Okay 1st of all I would start by saying that the food in the restaurant is worth trying. If you are a fan of beef tehari, this the place to go. Very authentic. 

However, don't bother choosing them for catering. We throw big parties every other weekend and usually get caterers instead of cooking and smelling up our million dollar home. Decided to give this restaurant a try. It was a big disappointment. The package looked attractive with the price. But when we saw the amount of food, it was rather alarming. Being the hosts we decided not to eat until all the guests were served. 

The rice Pilaf wasn't the greatest. Vegetables were okay. The beef curry didn't taste great (however the restaurant beef curry tasted great), the salad they provided was laugh worthy. The only 2 items that were delicious however were chicken roast and chilli fish. 

To be honest don't choose this place for catering. We had better elsewhere. Like star, makkah etc."}
{"text":"A place for authentic Bangladeshi food.
The staffs are very nice, polite and offers excellent service with smile.

The food are great, if you like to taste authentic Bangladeshi foods, including snacks and street foods (chotpoti, fuchka). We tasted chicken gila kolija, beef kolija, different bhortas, khichuri, beef bhuna, chotpoti and fuchka... all was excellent authentic."}
