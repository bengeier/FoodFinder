{"text":"I've grown up in the South Hills of Pittsburgh and Lotus Garden has been around long before I was born.  Due to it's long running history, I decided to give this Chinese restaurant a try.  Unfortunately I was not impressed.  Lotus Garden's menu is what you would expect from a typical Chinese restaurant: egg rolls, won ton soup, lo mein, and rice dishes accompanied with various meats.  I decided to go with a dish I've had many times in the past, so I ordered Kung Pao Chicken with an egg roll and won ton soup.    The won ton soup was excellent, and the egg roll had a unique crispy texture (although lacking in flavor).  However, the brown sauce for the Kung Pao wasn't very good at all, and I had hard time getting through 1/3 of the meal.  Ditto with my girlfriend's Orange Chicken.  Not to mention, they give a very small glass of water and aren't consistent with refills.  Overall, the only thing I really enjoyed about my meal and my girlfriend's was the won ton soup.  The staff was very nice at least, but with the vast number of choices you have for Chinese food, you should consider looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sad to hear that this place closed.  Amazing service, so friendly and the guy always remembered us.  The wonton soup was genius, I've never had it as good as this place.  Everything was served piping hot and I'd never had a bad dish here.  Hoping this place can return someday..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here after passing it hundreds of times and after learning that it's been around for sixty years it must be good right? Wrong. The people were nice enough, however the food was not anything to write home about. I suggest going to the new Chinese resturant on Brownsville road instead. I do give them props for the cost. Our meal was very cheap, but that's not good enough for me."}
{"text":"One of Yelp's competitor's is showing that Lotus Garden is closed, and if it is,  I am saddened. I've had a sinking feeling that the business had gone defunct whenever I've passed it in recent months, noticing an absence of cars in the lot during peak hours, that dreaded orange sign in the window, and unlit interiors.  I've a sentimental attachment to this restaurant I hadn't visited in years simply because it was the one that introduced me to Chinese food at the age of 5. My parents brought us here warily, thinking that my sister and I, picky eaters that we were, would turn our noses up at such exotic fare.   All it took was a bite of a water chestnut, and a boiled wonton, and this strange new food became a staple of my life.   I recall that pretty Asian women were doting on us as they were pleasantly surprised that we enjoyed everything we had, from the crispy cylinders full of seafood and vegetables to the brown rice with bits of steak hiding in it. While other Chinese restaurants, many in fact, popped up all over the area in the ensuing years, they were merely takeout go-tos -- Lotus Garden was THE place to DINE when it came to Chinese food. Never thinking about getting carry-away from LG, we always had to go there, sit down, and eat. Alas, we slowly forgot about LG as more convenient  Chinese dining options began to emerge, and for that, shame on us.   It's probably a longshot, but I do hope that someone else buys the place up and keeps it as it once was. Lotus Garden certainly blazed a trail for Asian fare in this part of the city, and therefore deserves a revival as much as Real McCoy Sandwich Shop, Vincent's Pizza Park, and Greb's Bakery do. Does anyone remember tradition or are we too mesmerized by the fleeting allure of the future to notice?   Damn. 60 years. It's easy to get excited about all the new happenings when you're a transplant, but when you've lived in this quadrant of Pittsburgh all your life like I have, and a place like Lotus Garden goes under, you can't help but be wistful over its demise."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm the first to review! How can that be? The Lotus Garden has been around for 60 years and there's no question as to why. The food is fantastic and the staff is very friendly and accomodating.  My meal always starts out with an egg roll. These are no ordinary egg rolls...they're not tiny, and aren't considered one of those side items tossed in as an afterthought as at most Chinese restaurants. No - these egg rolls could be a meal! Filled with baby shrimp, cabbage, and carrots, the filling is tender with a bit of a crunch. The wrapper isn't your typical thin, fried, \"papery skin\". The wrapper is a bit more substantial because of the size of the egg roll..yet it's crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside. The best egg rolls I've ever eaten.  I also like to order the fried pork dumplings. They're pretty basic as pork dumplings go, but they have a great flavor and the dipping sauce is very good. I'm pretty picky about my dumpling sauce. I don't like it too salty or too sweet. This is just perfect with a touch of heat.  My main course staple is the chicken with garlic sauce. This is noted on the menu as a spicy item. The Thai red pepper flakes give it the right amount of heat without overpowering the garlic brown sauce. It's a simple dish with slivers of white meat chicken, slivered water chestnuts, and a few mushrooms tossed in for good measure. This dish is so flavorful that you don't need anything else. I love the chicken paired with the crunch of the water chestnuts. They both take on the flavor of the sauce quite well.   Other great dishes are the chicken lo mein, General Tso's Chicken, and chicken with broccoli.  Plus the atmosphere is welcoming and cozy. No need for takeout!"}
