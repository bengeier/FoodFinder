{"text":"Best fast-food Mexican in the valley. Fresh watermelon juice & handmade tortillas. Incredibly tasty."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself has a terrific mexican aesthetic. The color pallette is  bright and vibrant. I had the chicken fajitas and they were excellent. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Mexican restaurants for over 30 years in the valley. THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST ONE WE HAVE EVER BEEN TO! This is not your standard Mexican restaurant, and is NOT a fast food restaurant. The food is prepared and offered to you like any high end restaurant. Some of the best seafood recipes we have ever had. You will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"This is a solid neighborhood Mexican restaurant. The ordering process is a little confusing--you have to order at the cash register instead of the long counter behind which the food is prepared. The food was less spicy than is my liking...but the salsa was quite unique."}
