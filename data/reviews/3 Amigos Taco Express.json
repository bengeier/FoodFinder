{"text":"I agree with the other guy, everything here is fantastic.

So this place is both a taco stand and a store. You can order in or take out, or buy Sponch! or anything else you might desire. And if you get a plain taco here without anything on it, sure, you may looking for something more. But if you get the literally any meat and load the tacos up with cilantro, cheese, red onion, and the jalapeno sauce, you'll wish you knew about this place forever ago. The meat was all moist and flavorful, cooked properly and presented well. The beef tongue was awesome.

The salsa is fresh and there are three housemade sauces that can't be beat. You can't beat the sauce or the price, so I will be a weekly customer for sure."}
{"text":"My partner and I had high hopes for this place.   Bummer.   I have to agree 100% with Mark, the other one star review.   Disclaimer:  Don't know him and didn't read his review until after we ate here.

The meat has no taste.   It's in desperate need of seasoning.  My guess is that it's precooked,  frozen and re-heated.

The salsa provided with the chips was watered down and again,  no taste.   By far the worst salsa in the world. 

The cold bar provided to doctor up the tacos has generic, no-taste sour cream, hot sauce that isn't hot, icky lettuce,  and all the usual taco toppings that were ICE COLD therefore making my taco more like a cold treat on a hot summer day.  

For the $22 we spent,  we should have eaten anywhere else.   Just go next door to Aldi's where they probably buy their supplies and get your own taco stuff. 

Suggestion:  Take the booths out,  expand your retail operation and if you still feel the need to sell food,  make it take-out.   There's too much better competition within 500 ft. In every direction."}
{"text":"There is something  be said about a place that  sells tacos, cough syrup, the Virgin Mary pictures, and fleece blankets. It's  express because the meat is already pre cooked, then re-heated on order. The steak was tough n chewy and the corn tortilla was soggy. You have to add your own toppings from a questionable cold bar that had shredded lettuce that was browning, and onions that were either white onions or maybe yellow onions; I wasn't sure.  No flavor, and packaged on a Styrofoam plate with foil,  like a dish at a fair. Maybe they were having an off day, but dnot knock it on my review until you try it. My buddy loves it and says it's great. The young lady at register was very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Two 1 star reviews? That's sad. 
I've been here 3 times now and really enjoyed everything I've had.  
 It's advertised as authentic Mexican. I can't say for sure, because I'm not familiar with \"authentic\" Mexican food. It is definitely not when same as the tex-mex served other \"Mexican\" restaurants.
The Mexican Street Corn was a bit strange, with the mayonnaise, but after the second bite I realized it was a pretty good combo.
The Sopas was very tasty. Many people don't like corn breads or corn tortillas but I actually prefer it to flour based breads. I think I'll go for the larger Huarachas next time, though.
The Mexican Cheeseburger is probably going to be my default item when I come back. It's hard to describe, but it's kinda like a burrito on flat bread. The menu says it's a ground beef patty but mine was seasoned crumbled ground beef. Either way, Wow. Delicious.
 If you're looking for 4 star dining, keep looking. 3 Amigos isn't that type of place and doesn't aspire to be. 
 If you're looking for a meal that is different from anything else available in this area, open your mind, open your mouth and give it a try."}
