{"text":"Went here twice.  Fist time was okay.  Was like Harvey's but price was a lot more than any Harveys.   Second time I went in with my 2 kids at about 2pm.  Service was slow.  None of the staff looked or spoke in a friendly manner.  It was like being in a Korean owned convenience store.

Got 3 combos.  All 3 tasted like re-heated patties so extremely dry.  Buns were hard and crumbling.  Fries were seriously cold to a point where they were served shriveled, like tey were sitting around for an hour.  Left bad impression on me to a point where I crossed off all Hero Burgers joints in general unless there is no where else (like BigBoys where you see them actually prepare the food)"}
{"text":"Excellent juicy fresh burger. Crispy fluffy fries. Very friendly service. Great menu choices or build your own. Would definitely eat again. Would even choose over Five Guys."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you're in a hurry as they're quite inefficient during peak hours.

The food tastes great, but since it's fresh, it takes forever to get your burger prepared. Granted I got there with but a few minutes to spare and a pretty long line-up, but this venue showed up under \"fast food\" on my GPS, so I guess they were misrepresented.

Service was friendly, prices a tad high, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"You can receive a free Sunday and exclusive deals by scanning the Q-Code in my picture. 

Ordered an 8oz Angus Beef Burger for dinner with poutine on the side. 

The burger has double slices of meat, I requested for pickles, tomatoes, mustard dijon, and reddish added on the side. The reddish and the pickles really enlightened the taste of the burger and made it more excited to eat. Overall, the burger is a bit dry. I would prefer more sauce.

For the poutine, the fries taste good, especially with the cheese, but the gravy is kind of salty to me and I do think there's too muchLess gravy will be preferable."}
{"text":"Went in to order take out with 12 mins left, and saw the banner to order through the app to save $5. A staff/ owner said don't order through the app you won't get the code until tomorrow. So I ordered and not continue the download of the app. My wife continued with signing up with the App while I ordered because they kept rushing me. The code came through and I asked \"well it actually came in, can I use it ?\" The staff/ owner said no you can't use it. It's for on line only\". If he didn't give me false information and not used the app I would've been able to use the coupon.

Don't come here if you don't want to deal with attitude problems from the staff/ owner"}
{"text":"It was a typical hamburger joint where everything comes prepackage and all the cooks have to do is defrost it and fry it.  With that kind of preparation what do you expect from the taste.  I consider the burger are over priced if not controlled this place will easily shut down in less the  one year"}
{"text":"Friendly service with good tasting burgers. Combos can get a bit pricey but the quality of ingredients is worth it. The sweet potatoe fries are a bit soft. Free refills."}
{"text":"Ordered through Ubereats app and there is a section where you can make special requests. I put in no onions and no relish. Hero Burgers completely disregarded the special requests. Went through Ubereats to complain and was taken around in circles. They said they may not be able to fulfill special requests due to volume. Completely ridiculous! If I went in person they can't disregard this. What's the point in having a special request portion on the app if it's not going to be looked at? Don't order from this restaurant or Ubereats -- there's no accountability. Take your money elsewhere"}
{"text":"People usually complain about the prices but I find that this place has a decent price for their quality of food. You can't really expect 5/5 customer service at a fast food restaurant. I usually come by for their mushroom pouting. 9$ including a soft drink which is an amazing price in my opinion. The wait time for food usually takes longer because they're making everything once the order is placed. The fries are always fresh, the burgers and poutines are always loaded up on ingredients. It's not the best but it's not the worst. I always go back when I pass by."}
{"text":"Probably THE place to get a decent burger around here. Service was quick and very friendly. Everything is cooked to order and the burgers were just perfect - not too dry and not undercooked."}
{"text":"Been coming here occasionally for quite some time now.  It's pretty standard hero burger fare.  Service is nothing to rave about - not bad, but there's definitely no free smile.

There's a hero burger one block south that seems to have way better service but hey, it's a fast food joint (albeit \"gourmet\"), what do you expect?"}
{"text":"Oh God this place stinks. Literally. The place was filled with smoke, the service was uber slow and the burger was medium rare (which is illegal in Canada). Oh, and they aren't cheap either. 

Be afraid, be VERY afraid."}
