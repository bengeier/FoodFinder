{"text":"After years of wanting to try this place...I did. The sushi is fresh, delicious and well prepared. Decent price range for meals plus the staff is friendly. From first impression the place reads like a cafeteria from the way the store is set up. Was a little disappointed that they didn't serve me tea...instead I was served tap water in a home mug.  in a nut shell check it out. and i'll be back like arnold."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, small take out joint with about 6 tables.  I was in the area and decided to give this place a shot.  I had salmon teriyaki bento box.  The only thing different was that it did not include miso soup like the other places on Bloor St.  Other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"Finally dropped into this tale of two eats: Sushi & BBQ on Dundas West. Just a maki roll's throw from the Art Gallery of Ontario, it's an extremely small space with only about eight two-tops and a window facing bar for loners that seats an additional eight. The tables have these neat little baskets for chopsticks and napkins that hang off the sides to conserve space. The restaurant is decorated as pleasantly as any decent sushi bar, and is clearly a family-run joint.   The menu features your standard sushi bento offerings, and typical Korean fare like donburi or bibimbap. There are however, more interesting options like the sashimi bibimbap or the bulgogi rolls. I was feeling not-so-adventurous (it was my first visit) so I got a conservative pairing of sushi rolls and BBQ pork ($11.95). It was quite a lot of food and I was surprised at the quality of fish. It wasn't bad at all. The meat was just OK.  With meal pricing ranging from $7.95 to $14.95 it's pretty affordable eats for people visiting the AGO or looking for a unique Asian fusion in the hood. I'd go back.  Obligatory Title Pun: Get BENTo.  Menu Readability: Twenty-six well-photographed and laminated options are posted above the counter.  Need to mention: They are closed Sunday.  What this place teaches me about myself: I can resist the call of bibimbap... sometimes."}
