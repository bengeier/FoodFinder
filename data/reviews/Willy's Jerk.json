{"text":"There are very few Caribbean restaurants that carry \"Stew Peas\" daily and are consistent with their portions. The staff are courteous and conscientious rather than rude and discouraging.  It may not be the fanciest but it's staff, meal choices and availability put it in a very select group.  Surrounding establishments carry similar menus, albeit you can only get certain items on special days."}
{"text":"I've had a ton of Jerk, but this is my favourite hands down.  They have a way of making the chickens skin so crispy and tasty.  The only way I can describe it is almost like a BBQ pork but chicken. $7.60 for medium jerk chicken and I never get anything else.  Rice is a bit oily but some hot sauce balances it out ok.  Decent slaw too.  Take out always because there is just one table, but who cares the chicken is amazing."}
{"text":"This place continually disappoints.  Don't count on them having what you want, but rather just order what they have.  Today I wanted red pea soup, and although it's on the menu they don't have it.  Chicken soup or nothing.  I ended up getting a patty with no coco bread because guess what?  They don't have any....."}
{"text":"The food is good but there just too rude bad service good food I would go back only for the food and Ima get the hell outta there"}
{"text":"I tried their jerk  chicken and rice . it was very tasty!! Their sauce is to die for. However, I arrived around 830pm one evening and was disappointed that they ran out of a few menu items."}
{"text":"I found their jerk to be dull as dishwater. When I crave jerk, I want it to be aromatic and pungent! 

They were out of beef patties the day I visited and the woman at the counter didn't look me in the eye for the entire time I transacted with her. 

Two customers, upon leaving, circled and peered into my car that I left running out front where my wife and one year old waited. All-in-all, a very unpleasant visit to Willy's. I willy not be back."}
{"text":"The oxtail is amazing ! The rice and peas is nice and moist and they put the perfect amount of gravy not too much and not too little just right !"}
{"text":"Great jerk chicken, rice & peas, plantains & patties."}
{"text":"Little spot tucked away in between other restaurants, they make a Solid jerk chicken but the price is a little on the high side unless you come here between 11 and 1 pm and enjoy the lunch special, fried chicken and rice for $4.99"}
{"text":"This is my little go to spot. The food is great. My specials are stew peas and jerk chicken. They always accommodate my half vegetables/half rice request. 
There's also a mid day lunch special.... Don't know the time, nor the price.
The ladies are a little more pleasant and engaging than I've experienced in other Jamaican restaurants. 
Willy's is a small location tucked away in a small strip mall at the intersection of Keele St & Finch Ave W. It's more of a grab and go, however if you have to sit and eat their are 4 seats and two tables which are sometimes full during lunch hours.
They don't always have what's on the menu."}
{"text":"*This is now my third time at Willy's so consider this review a thorough and accurate representation of the average \"foodie experience\" here. 

Around 4:30pm today,  Sunday, I ordered the Fried chicken meal which comes with coleslaw and rice & peas. I asked for Jerk sauce on top of the chicken and Oxtail sauce on the side and then I realized the cashier charged me a $0.20 fee for this request without letting me know. So, I rolled my eyes (yeah, I did... I won't lie), and told her to forget the oxtail sauce and paid the regular $7.25 owed. 

Got home and discovered this in my takeaway bag (see pic). Of all the days to get a crappy meal this was not the one...chile please.
1) The fried chicken batter: soggy. It's certainly not crispy which is ODD because there is no evidence of politely requested Jerk sauce.
2) Chicken magically both smells & tastes of old fish. How delightful. I love surprises. Asked for chicken but hey look you got fish. Ha. Ha.  Well played, Willy, well played indeed. 
3) Rice & peas have sadly been demoted to mush. Tastes like depression...or the Cold War, or what have you. 
4) To top off all that super goodness, the coleslaw texture and taste is reminiscent of shredded-up wet socks. 

lol...ok ok. Maybe I'm exaggerating just a TAD but I don't know how else to describe the extent of this 'unfreshness'! IMHO, the whole thing looks like death! 

The last few meals here were average but congrats are in order for ' Mr. Willy'. You have truly outdone yourself today. This food RIGHT HERE is for the truly starving.  And I'm just not there yet (give it a few hours and I'll get 'er done...I hate to waste food). As for now, this slop has made my nausea level so high I can' t stomach anything thank you, not even my beloved hummus. I guess I'll be having this Oasis Mango Smoothie for lunch and dinner which,  I guess, is really not such a bad thing cuz it is diviiiiine. I just wish I had made the wiser decision and put that $7.20 towards something healthier: a couple of cold Heinkeken's ;) 

#firstworldproblems. 

So what did we learn... yeah, sorry, there's more lol. Did you think I was done? No siree this is a #fullonrant

Again, \"so what did we learn\" from this lovely review, ladies and gents? That cheap eats ain't always the bee's knees. Meals under $10 CAN BE risky business - it's an everyday struggle (R.I.P. B.I.G.). Ultimately, I know Willy's can AND HAS served better dishes, so do yourself a favor and restrict your cheap-eat-chowdowns to the \"special lunch deal\" hours of 11 to 1pm weekdays. Otherwise, you risk getting tossed yesterday's leftovers.

Update: no one, not even the starving students round here, could handle that mess. Food gone to garbage. Such a waste :("}
{"text":"Very friendly, generous portion.
Fair prices.
Jerk chicken was excellent.
Food coma occurring."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5/4 but I didn't have the heart to round down. This place is OK. They offer lots of Caribbean dishes. I like that this place almost always has everything in stock. There are many Caribbean restaurants in the area that run out of popular items like \"jerk chicken\" by 2 pm and won't make any more. This place is good for that but the only problem is their flavour :( ... It's not the best Caribbean food in town... Very average....lacking that authentic flavour... And The meat is Sometimes dry. The festivals are pretty good though. Stew chicken doesn't taste like Jamaican brown chicken at all... Rice and peas again are lacking flavour."}
{"text":"Small place but friendly people, great jerk chicken, and price was just right."}
{"text":"Not bad, the rice was spicy had nice taste. Chicken was alright sorry i forgot to mention I had the jerk chicken. I don't have much to compare it to, I would come back it's close to my place."}
