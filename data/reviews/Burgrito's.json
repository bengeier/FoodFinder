{"text":"These guys are the new kids in town and they're out to please. The service here was AMAZING! I asked about if the steak was spicy and the employee offered to whip me up a little batch to taste on the house. I was surprised to see their menu is mostly either burgers or burritos with just the one burgito though again, the employee was awesome and said he could make anything into a burrito if I wanted. 
The food was a little expensive but certainly filling. Flavor was good and fresh. There are about 6 or so tables inside-very casual. Check them out if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I headed to Burgrito's over the weekend. It was UW graduation weekend, so many of the restaurants downtown were packed. We headed to Monroe St and those eating spaces were all full as well, except this one. I had read a couple good reviews on the spot and it is an interesting concept, so we decided to settle in.

The staff wasn't impolite, but they certainly weren't very chatty either. I ordered the Burgrito and my wife just a plain cheeseburger with a side of fries, 2 fountain sodas as well. The total was $30 which I wasn't expecting, especially for what came out to the table. 

Mine was literally just a burger that instead of a bun was wrapped in a tortilla (I don't know what more I was expecting, but I've seen McDonald's doing this to for a \"healthier\" option), so was a little disappointed. My wife's burger was pretty dry. Fries were decent, but not great. Also not a great place for small children, there was only one high chair and the straps were broken so she kept accidentally slipping through the leg area.

Probably ok for hangover food, but I wouldn't plan on stopping back again."}
{"text":"Went to this place three times: the first time the service was very slow, but the food was good.  The next time, Saturday April 14, went in and were immediately told, \"We're not accepting walk ins\". The phone was ringing constantly and the employees just weren't answering it.  We were told we could possibly get service if we ordered online, but they would not take orders in person.  As it turned out, their website was down, so it wasn't actually possible to place an online order.  We were turned away without so much as a coupon, and were not served even though the restaurant was open and there were others seated.  
Went back for the third (and final) time: placed an online order as a safeguard and went to pick it up.  Even though it was about a week later, they were still turning people away saying, \"we're not accepting walk in orders.\"  When I gave them my info, they had not started my order, and took a significant amount of time to even find it.  The most senior employee did apologize, said he would have comped the food if we hadn't already paid online, and personally guaranteed me that the order would be ready in 15 minutes.  About 25 minutes later, he came over, and said they would comp the order after all if I gave him my info.  He failed to mention that they did not actually intend to prepare the food.  I waited patiently another 15 minutes, as the obviously still open, staffed, functional kitchen continued to prepare food, and serve customers who arrived *after* me to pick up online orders. Finally, after I'd been there about 45 minutes total waiting on an order that I had already paid for and was supposed to be ready for pickup, I went up and asked if they had an updated estimate of when my order would be ready.  It was only at this point that I was told they were closing the kitchens and would not be making my order.  After guaranteeing it would be done in 15 minutes.  And after watching me sit there and wait for 45 minutes.  After making other online orders for customers who arrived after I did.  Promising me a future refund that I am dubious I will receive.  I drove 20 minutes to get there, waited 45 minutes, and drove 20 minutes home.  With no food, and they kept my money.  Massive waste of my time, and they charged me for an order they never made and did not refund when they finally said they would not be making it.  It is disappointing, because this looked like a unique restaurant. But due to their astonishingly poor management and unbelievably bad customer service, I would highly recommend you take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Such an interesting and tasty experience. I don't often eat burritos but having a burger and fries in one makes it worth my while. Extremely friendly staff and relaxed setting."}
{"text":"Not sure what to say, but we have been there twice and left because they couldn't serve food. The first time they said it would take over an hour, tonight they stopped taking orders. Sorry, we won't be back. Too bad that location has such a bad omen."}
{"text":"Really good food, and very unique as well. But plan to be there at least half an hour. It seems as though they're still figuring out how to run everything efficiently, because every time I have gone there I have had to wait 20+ minutes for my food, even when I'm the only customer in the restaurant. Definitely would recommend trying it out at least once because there's nowhere else like this place in Madison, so I do hope they figure out how to prepare the food more quickly and efficiently. Make sure you call in with an order well in advance, unless if you have time to spend waiting for your food.

Edit: changed from 2 stars to one star because it's been almost 40 minutes and I still haven't gotten my food. I wanted to like this place so badly, but this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken burrito with guacamole. The chicken was really salty, and I didn't get any guac (even though it costs extra). My boyfriend ordered a burgrito that he really liked. It's a burger and fries inside of a tortilla. We ordered delivery, and the delivery guy was really friendly!"}
{"text":"I was really hungover when I went to Burgrito's. Like, really hungover. It was one of those days that made me think about quitting alcohol. Needless to say, I was in desperate need for some junk food. It seemed like the perfect time to finally try Burgrito's.

Since I was too hungover to drive, my fiancee drove me so that I could pick up my carry out order. The food traveled well! My burgrito and loaded fries were still hot and melty when we got home. The burgrito was pretty awesome. It's simply a well-made bacon cheeseburger wrapped in a hot tortilla along with fries instead of placed between buns. Since tortillas aren't airy like burger buns, the bacon cheeseburger goodness is delivered to your in a more dense and concentrated bite than a normal burger. I liked it, and it was my saving grace in the wake of Hangoverzilla.

Those loaded fries, however, were pretty bad. You can't really go wrong with cheese and bacon from a fast food place, but the ranch they use tastes funky. It has kind of a sweet vinegar flavor. The worst part was the fries. They just had way too much salt on them. They must have added extra salt because the fries inside of the burgrito didn't ruin the whole thing like this did.

While I found my burgrito to be pretty good, I found that those loaded fries were unforgivably bad. If you find yourself at Burgrito's, stick to their signature dish. It tastes as good as it sounds. However, you should avoid the loaded fries no matter how hungover you are."}
{"text":"Went there again last night. Service was friendly and prompt despite about 6 groups of people there ordering around same time. Something I missed the first time through: They don't take cash (unless you have exact change.) Only credit. Their chip reader is really quick through which is good. Still no complaints from us on the ambiance or food."}
{"text":"Burger + Burrito = Yum!

Burgrito's is a peppy little joint on Monroe Street. They serve burgers, burritos, burrito bowls, and a mashup called a burgrito.

The burgrito is essentially a burger and fries wrapped in a tortilla, sort of like the Applebees quesadilla burger. It comes served with lettuce, diced tomatoes, and a chipotle sauce. I also added pickles and carmelized onions. I have a cold, and the flavors still punched through my lessened sense of taste.

The service was courteous and efficient, and the only negative is the challenging traffic and parking situation due to the Monroe Street construction. I hope this place can survive that!"}
{"text":"I haven't been in to Burgrito's just yet, but I have had a couple meals. So far, I am a fan! 

The idea of a burger in a burrito seemed really weird to me, but when I tried it for the first time, it totally made sense. It was so good! The fries were nice and salty with a perfect crispness, the burger was cooked perfectly, and it really just made for a delicious, unique meal. 

I know they offer a lot of other options. I haven't gotten that far yet, but I will be sure to try more. If everything is fun and yummy as the burgritos, I know I won't be disappointed."}
