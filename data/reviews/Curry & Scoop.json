{"text":"I placed a catering order for Chicken Tikka Masala and Methi Malaai Paneer and the quality of food was very disappointing. The sauce was extremely watery for both curries. The almost half tray Chicken curry had less than a small bowl( cereal bowl) of chicken in it. The Paneer dish was very salty."}
{"text":"I recently tried the Cut Mirchi, Veg Biryani and the Indian ice cream. Looks like this place is under new management. Cut Mirchi was one of the best I have tried in the valley. The biryani was good as well. I loved the ice cream - the Metha Pan flavor. I would definitely recommend to try this place out..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the vegetarian appetizers - mirchi Bhaji and Alu ki Tikki. If you can not handle spices order mild, even medium was pretty spicy. Chana Masala and Malai Kofta were also great along with Garlic Naan for main course and then topped by Tutti Frutti ice cream was delicious. Unfortunately there are no restrooms so one has to use towellets to clean hands before and after food. Definitely affordable prices."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food. We had a family party this weekend and had originally planned to order food from another indian restaurant. But, i came to know about this place from a colleague and decided to give it a try. 

The food was awesome. Everyone at our party was curious on where we got the food as they all felt that it tasted like home food(healthy and high quality). The price was very reasonable. 

Our menu included 

1. Veg Cutlet: It was really crispy and retained lesser oil for a fried food. 
2. Veg Briyani: I always judge an indian restaurant based on the Briyani they serve and trust me they serve one of the best Briyani's in the valley. 
3. Veg Kothu parota: The spice was great. all the veggies were cooked to perfection and blended well together 
4. Malai Kofta: The curry was mild and yet flavorful 
5. Chapathi: Very soft and went well with the Malai Kofta. 
6. Gulab Jamun: These were really huge and perfectly soaked. There was a pinch of Cardamon and Pistachio flavor to it that made the taste rich.
7. Besar Pista Ice cream: This was recommended to us by Curry & Scoop. And OMG, they tasted awesome. 

We served only Veg in our party and couldn't try the non-veg side of C&S's menu. But, I hear C&S's non-veg food selections are better. I cant wait to try the non-veg entries. Will sure be a regular for both the Curry selections and Scoop(/Ice cream) selections."}
{"text":"Indian food and ice cream!  The food is excellent. I had the chicken biryani and mango lassi and both was very good. Must ask to add up the spice level if you're good with spicy good. The paratha is the most famous item on the menu and was very good too. 

On the ice cream menu, there are a lot of selections including classic flavors and exotic flavors as well. Definitely go for the exotic flavors. You can ask for single scoop mix with 2 flavors. I had the badam with saffron and it was excellent."}
{"text":"I had the large chicken tikka masala and the large chettinad masala. I was surprised that they didn't come with rice or naan like I read in the other reviews. The chicken tikka masala had pieces of bell pepper in it and on the first day was sweet and flavorful. The chettinad masala was spicy and also flavorful. After the first day, I found that I liked the chettinad masala better, even though initially I liked the chicken tikka masala better.  Both of the dishes were quite spicy."}
{"text":"Wow! Came in for lunch and got paneer tikka masala. Very good and I'm super full after. Interesting interesting idea to have combination with ice cream. 

Only negative is there was way too much onion in the food. So unless you're obsessed with onion, I'd recommend to request no or light onion. 

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was very surprised to see this location now has Indian food. It was a cupcake place then ice cream.  Cute and clean inside. Love the vegetarian offerings. The potato appetizer was delish! I had the bowl with rice and paneer which was spicy and great. 
Very reasonably priced too.
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"An Amazing Tandoori chicken that I ever tasted in the Valley for just 2.99 dollars!!! A must try!!"}
{"text":"My first time here. I ordered take out and gladly so. It was a bit awkward when I walked in because no one was behind the register- no employees to be found. I starred at the ice cream options for a good 5 minutes before someone came out to give me my food. 

I am impressed by the price and food itself reminds me of Indian street food! I can't wait to come back and try some of the ice cream :) but during this first visit I got the chicken biryani and chicken 65. Both were good, I liked the chicken 65 more, the flavor was great! The biryani was a bit dry - hard to say how old it was but you can tell when food is over a day old ;) 
I'll be back to try other options. I'll definitely be getting the chicken 65 again, I'm not sure why it's called that but to me they were like boneless Indian chicken wing? Haha"}
{"text":"First time there! The guy was super friendly and not only allowed us to try multiple flavors but also explained all the Indian flavors and even had pictured of where each flavor came from. I haven tried the curry yet, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved here from El Paso and we are trying out all the Indian restaurants we can to find our new favorites. We've tried at least 5 so far and this is by far the best!! I love the 'snack and ice cream' concept. Tried the Gulkand ice cream and it was bomb. The Tikka masala was spicy enough (yay!!) and the prices are very fair. Don't pass this place up !!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing the paneer ticka was spicy and full of flavor and the curry French fries were amazing 

We also had the Samosas and the pistachio ice cream. I wish they offered the calaflour dish everyone was talking about on yelp. 

Can't wait to go back really reasonable and the   chief was friendly and really made sure we enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOD. This place is a hidden treasure. Everything is delicious from the Curry to the endless amounts of Ice Cream options."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food joints in town. This comes from a picky eater. I ate up a couple of times and it was great. Right levels of spice, taste which was important to me. 
I ended up ordering Indian food from here for a party and it was a huge hit. Unbeatable for the price/quality/quantity."}
{"text":"Best Indian food ever! Great staff! Prices are good. Must try their signature rose petal ice cream! It was truly amazing! I can't wait to go back to try everything!"}
{"text":"Curry curry curry!

I love me some curry. We stopped in one night for a random side adventure. While I love Chinese curry, Indonesian curry, Thai curry, and Japanese curry, I never had Indian curry. I was impressed. We had a wide arrray of items like the Tikka Fries, Chicken Curry, Vada Pap, and Vegetable Fried Rice. Everything had good flavor and spice. I also like the ice cream here. It's a nice cool treat after you set your mouth on fire!

The wife likes it here so I'm sure we'll be back. I recommend this casual little joint to everyone."}
{"text":"I love this place. The management is polite,customer-oriented  and the food is delish. They usually have a special of the day but didn't this past Saturday. Hopefully it is not a permanent thing. My son always tags along for the fries. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"The flavors are so good! Excellent place to stop and pick up dinner! I like that they change the menu seasonally and the mango lasse is delicious!"}
{"text":"This review only applies to the ice cream. We stopped in one night. The woman working was very friendly and let us try the flavors we weren't familial with--they have both Indian and the \"standard\" US flavors. We settled on a scoop of chai and a scoop of chocolate chip. The chocolate chip tasted a bit freezer burned, chalky, and was full of ice crystals. The $2 carton of Kroger brand is better than this. The chai was better. Richer, creamier, but there were still ice crystals. The food has great reviews and I'm tempted to try it but the ice cream was really disappointing."}
{"text":"Curry & Scoop... I don't even know how to say everything I feel about this place, it is SO delicious!! Friends and I came here on a whim because we were intrigued by its name, and I'm so glad we did -this has to be my new favorite Indian restaurant of all time - The portions are ridiculously large, the seasonings are perfect, it is fast and affordable, and the bearded worker who helped us, was so knowledgeable and friendly!  

I got the chicken biryani and samosas for dinner, and ended up saving more than half because I was full! It was a little spicy for me, but definitely a good kind of burn haha

I also sampled every ice cream flavor, and if you even only kind of like sweets, you must come here!! My favorites were the gulkand (rose and honey flavor) and the kesar badam (saffron and almond flavor), but honestly there are no \"bad\" flavors. If you're in the area or craving Indian food, or even if you're not, definitely give Curry & Scoop a try.. you won't regret it!! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's great curry and fantastic ice cream with new flavors cycled through often. The flavors are varied and Indian inspired, and amazing. The customer service is always great and I'm never disappointed when I go in no matter what I get."}
{"text":"Mixing Indian food and ice cream is the best idea ever! Made in house mango ice cream was out of this world! I had paneer tikka and chicken curry, both of which were delicious. The staff was incredibly friendly, and even pulled out my chair for me to be seated when my food arrived. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've tried every single ice cream they make here and they are all excellent (even if some flavors aren't necessarily my favorite). We have ordered a large selection of the rest of the menu and we've never been disappointed. It is a unique combination that we really enjoy."}
{"text":"Went In there for the first time today, had a great experience! Delicious food and the ice cream made in house was out of this world. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My only regret is not trying it sooner. We had several main dishes. The eggplant fry was a real highlight with great textures and flavor from the peanuts. Prices are great and the staff is very nice. They have both classic ice cream flavors and more exciting Indian flavors. 

I could go on and on about the food, but just go try it."}
{"text":"Definitely my new go-to for gimme-the-heat-sweats biryani!   This place has killer Indian food in a quick casual environment and a wild selection of house-made ice cream flavors that include things like Golkund and Rasamalai...  and are f---king spectacular!

I love bringing the kids here to broaden their palates a bit (if they're gonna try something new, it's sure easier when it's ice cream)."}
{"text":"The last thing you can do is to serve Costco's Naan. This is the main  reason I am writing this review.

Chicken curry was ok but the chicken was hard. 
Gobi Manchurian was too sweet, i guess the chef ended up adding more sauce.
Very disappointed and wont recommend this place for good authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"Curry and ice cream might seem like a crazy idea, but it is crazy good. The curry is flavorful and spicy (which is delightful) and then you can cool off with a delicious Indian ice cream (also delightful). It is a must try. I have been here twice already and will definitely come back again for more curry and ice cream."}
{"text":"Quick, simple, no hassle  Indian food. Menu is pretty impressive for a small shop like this. Friendly service and great prices. 
Was worried about there not being a lot of choices but I was wrong. They have a lunch menu, a dinner menu, catering menu, and not to mention ice cream  can't go wrong with that . Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"A small little Indian place, yet amazing options on homemade ice creams.
They have a small menu for Indian chaats and curries/biryani.
Ordered -
Veggie Kothu paratha - tasted good, pepper was little on higher side. No sides was given with it. Good evening meal though.
Vada pay- had this thing after ~4 years maybe. Was about to cry.. Lol. Give it a shot, it's good.
Veggie Cutlet - guessing it's a frozen ones and not freshly made. So not a big deal breaker here.
Gulkhand and Coconut ice cream - Best and best and best.. Really loved it. In fact they have new flavors added/experimented. Don't blame me if you don't find coconut ice cream one day.

Small place, Good ambience. FYI - there are no restrooms .

I would rate this place 4.5."}
{"text":"First you take the curry and you scoop it, you scoop it...right onto your plate! 

We had Chicken Tikka, Malai Kofta, French Fries with Tikka Sauce, and Chicken 65. I enjoyed all the food we have sampled and the prices of the food even more! 

The ice cream, however, was a tad too sweet for my liking and costs almost as much as the food -- $4.99 for a double scoop of a specialty flavor is the same price as getting one of the curries. 

I would probably get food to go next time due to the odd tables and chairs that were a little uncomfortable, an unusual lower light fixture that kept getting in the way (silly, light), and the food is serve in to-go containers when you dine-in anyway. 

But for quick, cheap, and delectable take out Curry & Scoop hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled because it doesn't look like other Indian restaurants, the food is great!  I've been a few times now and the food is consistently freshly made, really flavorful and has a good amount of spice. 

Plenty of veggie options - the gobi Manchurian is nice and crispy with a great tangy sauce and the veggie sauté's are nice & spicy with a little sweetness from caramelized onion.  I tried the Malai Kofta today and it was awesome, potato & paneer dumplings in a rich, creamy sauce - very filling.  Good place to share a few different things with friends.

I haven't tried the ice-cream yet, looks great, but I've enjoyed all the food menu items.  I do wish they'd use more eco-friendly containers, I've been taking mine home and reusing them."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome first impression! So this place is brand-spankin'-new. I walked in about 10 min before closing. When I saw something about \"Indian inspired ice cream flavors\" as I passed by, it just sounded like something I couldn't NOT try! So upon entry, I was welcomed by a very kind woman who I got to chat with about the place. She informed me that a few elements of the business weren't available yet (specifically the Curry aspect of it), but they'd be up and running and offering it very soon. It was really great to see many of the Indian inspired flavored ice cream tubs almost down to nothing! She informed me that people walk in and request samples of pretty much all the flavors (24 different ones) ALL the time! And she's happy to oblige :). I wound up trying a few flavors and ultimately took home 3 separate (very hefty scoops) of Rum Raisin, Saffron & Pistachio, and Mango ice cream. All amazing! Can't wait to try their curries! Will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"We have come to love this little gem!  When you walk through the door, the smells from all of the Indian spices hit you and your sense that good, flavorful food is about to happen is spot on!  

First, they make ice cream.  Seems odd that an Indian restaurant would make ice cream but they do and they have an extensive selection.  I'm in love with the Cherry Amaretto and it is my go-to every time I'm there.  The creamy ice cream base is perfect with just the perfect hint of almond and it is full of pieces of cherries.

Ok, the food...so I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy food so ordered everything on that level of spice.  The cook even brought me some yogurt to help tone down things.  We ordered a huge variety of items because we wanted to try everything!  The Samosa's were so good and full of potato and vegetables.  We also had the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is my favorite.  The eggplant was good although even with mild spice it had a bite.  

Love, love, love this place!  Why four instead of five stars?  I am not a fan of Styrofoam because of the chemicals and I know they are cheap but there are so many other plate products out there that are better!"}
{"text":"Tried their Indian fried rice ( a fusion of chinese fried rice with Indian spices) and chicken 65 ( dried chunk of chicken pieces wrapped in indian spices) . Loved it. Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I ordered a curry dish and an appetizer to go for under $10. You can't do that anywhere else for this kind of quality food. This is the first time I eat here. Flavor and texture of food was great. Don't change anything Curry & Scoop! I'm coming back to try your ice cream and bringing a friend."}
{"text":"If you love Indian food then you are going to love this place. My kids are picky but absolutely loved the food. We didn't know what to order and the employee behind the counter was so helpful and knowledgeable in the dishes. He recommended the pepper chicken and the paneer chicken masala. Both were fabulous and just the right spice to them. The best part is we got to have ice cream afterwards."}
{"text":"Their carrot halwa \"was\" amazing the first time we got it..
And because of that made a mistake to get it the seocnd time and that too extra scoos. And they have put essences, and color in the ice cream. It used to be cream in color with flakes of carrot and now it's orange in color
Bad!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food has the best flavors and their ice cream has to be the best in Tempe! The guys that work there are friendly, make great recommendations and have created such a welcoming environment. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is probably the most consistent Indian restaurant in the valley in terms of quality and taste of food. This place never disappoints. The food menu is decent. My favorite items are paneer chilli, chicken biryani and chicken kottu paratha. 
The ice cream variety here is unparalleled. I sometimes visit just for the ice creams. Favorite is gulkand (rose petal). 
Must visit place for Indian food and ice cream lovers."}
{"text":"Tried a new local restaurant in my neighborhood Curry & Scoop. I did not know what to expect from this small little restaurant. I ended up getting the CNS pepper chicken lunch plate talk about a bang for your buck the chicken was nice and soft the flavors were amazing. The restaurant what's so cute the staff was so kind and polite talked me through the menu then after the meal asked if I wanted ice cream talked about all the flavors I wanted to be Aventuras and try a flavor I never tried but I had to stick with my butter pecan. Have to say definitely going back and telling all my friends about it"}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal but the service was even better! The server was very informative and patient with us. He ran us through the menu and described in detail. He even kindly offered a free appetizer. I would recommend this to anybody."}
{"text":"The 5 -star rating is based on what I tried. We ordered Indian Chicken fried rice (they have vegetables fried rice too), Chicken 65, and biriyani. Biriyani was very average. However, the Chicken 65 was absolutely fantastic. It is spicy enough to enjoy and crispy enough to savor. Chicken fried rice was also very good. I would say it was what I expected. At the end of the feast, :) we took 2 scoops of Mango and Gulkand and the ice creams were very good. Worth it! We have already tried the place couple of times and will visit again when we want to eat Chicken 65 and Chicken fried rice.
One thing to note, the place is small. Most people were taking out."}
{"text":"The food is marvelous. I will have to say the naan saved the day because the three curries I ordered were very spicy. The music and atmosphere are fun and upbeat."}
{"text":"Very very unimpressed... Saw all the great reviews so had to try it for myself so I ordered carry out.. I actually ordered chicken tikka masala ended up getting paneer tikka masala it was salty, Bland and the paneer was hard as rocks. Also ordered their chicken briyani... chicken was dry as well as the rice no salt at all... will never go there again!!!! The prices may be good but the food is horrible!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I decided that we were in the mood for some cheap Indian food and found this place by chance on Yelp. By the time we arrived, it was a bit late and there wasn't really anyone in there, so service was a bit slow that night (it may just be a today thing, I don't know how their service usually is). Considering it was our first time in, the person that helped us out at the counter went out of his way to describe some of the dishes that he personally recommended and was popular at the area. My friends decided on getting the chicken tikka masala while I got a different dish (something that had black pepper), with sides of rice and naan bread (you have to order the side separately, which is fine, considering that the total still comes up to around under $10) (also, the naan bread was a bit on the crispy side, but that's just a personal opinion).  While the service may have been slow that night, the dishes were worth the wait and were very filling and very tasty, especially for the price that they were at (other Indian places I've been to served very similar quality food for almost double the price, so this place was very good taste-to-price wise).

The person that helped us out was also very attentive to make sure that we were satisfied with our food and made sure to come out if we had any questions for him. Since a few of us had enough room for dessert, he gave some personal recommendations on what kind of ice cream to get. We ended up trying out their rose, lychee, and gulkand and kesar flavors, which we all loved. It was very light in flavor, but their ice cream is so soft and filling.

While the service has been slow that night, the service that we did receive was absolutely phenomenal and the dishes we've had were very delicious, especially for the price."}
{"text":"My daughter's birthday dinner was a total hit at curry & scoop. Our guests totally loved the food and ambience . Just loved the authentic taste. Indian inspired icecreams are out of the world . Meeta pan icecream is my personal favourite . 
I do recommend curry & scoop if you are craving for Indian food."}
{"text":"Hot eats, cool treats Indian style! This spot used to be a generic cupcake place which then turned into Jalsa ice cream which has now evolved into Curry and Scoop. 

The shop offers various chaat, biriyani, curries, and both American and Indian style ice creams. All the food items on the menu sounded delicious and it was hard to pick out just a few to snack on. I finally decided on the cut mirchi and chicken 65. 

The mirchi was maybe a 7/10 in spiciness for me, enough heat to put some fire in your belly but mild enough that I could still taste the flavor of the chilis and batter. I've only had mirchi at one other place, so I only have one other experience to compare to. While I liked the taste and heat of the chilis in this version, I prefer a lighter batter. This batter was more dense and thin. 

The chicken 65 was tender and juicy, but had a lighter flavor than other versions I've had. It was still enjoyable though and was served with sliced red onion and topped with cilantro. 

I sampled a few Indian influenced ice cream flavors. I tried the two summer special flavors: sitaphal and thandai, and also had a sample of the saffron pistachio. While I liked the flavor of the sitaphal (AKA sugar apple or sweetsop) the texture was too grainy for my tastes. The saffron pistachio had a rich creaminess and I could definitely taste the saffron flavor. I ultimately chose the thandai since it was a limited time special. I've never had the thandai in its typical drink form but I liked the delicate, herbal and slightly floral wisp of flavor with the creamy ice cream. For your reference a thandai drink has almonds, fennel seeds, magaztari seeds, rose petals, pepper, vetiver seeds, cardamom, saffron, milk and sugar in it.

Service was very friendly and accommodating. There were a lot of people here for a Sunday night which is always a good sign that your shop is selling a great product! 

The space is small but they manage to pack quite a few tables and a couch area in this spot. One small negative was that the table tops we were sitting at were warped and the table itself was wobbly. 

I love the idea of having savory snacks and ice cream all in the same spot and I like the unique nature of the ice cream they serve. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The owner is so nice and kind and the food and ice cream is fantastic. The only bad thing about this place is the second time we came, the guy who helped us (not the owner) was absolutely rude, interrupted us multiple times, and acted like he would rather be anywhere else than helping us. Sad."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday. 

Got take out: chicken tikka masala & paneer masala. Both came w rice & naan. Both dishes were super flavorful, and spicy. You can tell this is HOMEMADE food not prepackaged. Very delicious & portion size was perfect. 

I also got a scoop of the mango fig ice cream. It was a perfect blend. I feel like the fog really mellowed out the mango so together it was refreshing, sweet, but not overpowering. 

The guy who helped us was very friendly, helpful, professional, and patient. 

Had leftovers next day along w ice cream I didn't finish. Perfect snack w the ice cream as a little dessert to cool off the spice! Sooo good. 

Will definitely be coming back to try other options"}
{"text":"The food tasted delicious, the ice cream was delicious and the customer service was great. Only complaint is we didn't find much chicken in our chicken tikka masala. Might come back for the ice cream though."}
{"text":"I skipped the scoop, only because the chicken biryani was sooo filling! My rice had all the seasoning at the bottom of the container which I thought was a bit weird, but once mixed it was all good. Chicken was moist, loved the onion and egg. Never actually had lemon with my biryani before so that was a first. The yogurt sauce, I don't know it's name, was a bit thick. I heard someone ask spice level but I was never asked when I ordered, wish I was food needed a little more spice. The price was also really good! I need to go back to try the chicken 65 and the scoops!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream and friendly service

A cute place with some different Ice cream flavors as well as the usual staples like vanilla and chocolate. Since it's an Indian place, I recommend trying the gulkand or other more exotic flavors.

The server was friendly and very patient as we decided what we wanted, and offered samples galore. Overall I think this place could embrace its offerings more in the decor but it's a gem nonetheless. And interesting that they offer both sweet and savory - I'd like to return to try their Indian fare. 

They also offer a rewards program...buy 10 scoops get one free."}
{"text":"This place has the vibe of a food truck-turned-brick and mortar. The owner was taking orders and waiting tables, and the food was home-cooked, fresh, and so very piping hot. We had the fried cauliflower and a chicken tikka masala, along with some super fresh and buttery garlic naan. We could have eaten more, but saved room for the carrot halwa and tutti frutti Indian ice creams. The food was fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced. The only thing they could improve on is the addition of a bathroom. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has the smallest quantity and the cheapest Indian food in the valley. We tried the south Indian kothu parotta and the taste was up to the mark. The biryani was a disappointing though as the rice and chicken felt little old."}
{"text":"Spicy and good. Helped explain the menu. 1-5 degrees of hot. So if you say 5 let me know how that goes. I had #3 and could have gone for #4 maybe. Like Indian food, check it. I didn't try the ice cream but a few folks came in and that's what they ordered. Peace."}
{"text":"I was driving by and decided to stop in.  Didn't know what to expect so it was indian curry and ice cream.  Interesting concept.  I ordered a chicken curry to go.  As I was waiting, I sampled the indian flavored ice creams.  They were AMAZING.  Don't bother getting the chocolate/vanilla standard flavors.  The rose petal ice cream, mango, and pumpkin ice creams were insanely good.  They make the indian flavored ice creams in house.  

So I ordered a few ice creams to go.  When I got home and tried the curry, it was alright.  The chapati wasn't that great.  If they upped their paratha/chappathi/naan game and made the curries solid, this joint would be popping.  

BUT, come for the ice cream.  It's the best."}
{"text":"We ordered food for a birthday party. Taste was great and the quantity was more than enough.  We ordered masala vada for the appetizer. This was a big hit and the size was just right. I'd definitely recommend giving Curry and Scoop a try.

Thank you Srini, for the good food."}
{"text":"Great food, very flavorful. If you like spicy, any of the dishes are for you. If you can't take he heat, order MILD. Prices are very conservative ( the ice cream is more than the food) and the ice cream is awesome. We ordered the green tea ice cream- my new favorite."}
{"text":"A. [     ] amazing ice cream! An Extremely rich explosion of flavor. Came for desert the food smells amazing, coming back to try it out!"}
{"text":"This was exactly what I was looking for.   Great Indian curry and interesting ice cream flavors.  My wife had lychee and I had chai flavor ice cream.   Simple surroundings.   Clean and pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This place has such awesome food. They have  a special menu item called Kerala Parotta and that was so good. Spicy and super flavorful. 
You have to try their Tikka fries too. They also have a great assortment of Indian ice cream flavors along with regular flavors.
Eat spicy food and then eat ice cream! Great combination."}
{"text":"Nice! It is clean and inexpensive for a quick bite to eat. Pander tikki Masala is spiced nicely, Indian grain rice is authentic.  Staff is friendly and helpful and let us try several ice cream flavors.  Ice cream scoops are huge, one scoop is plenty with a meal. Try the mango & fig: yummy!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Crowded place during lunchtime even sometimes with a longer waiting line. Service is average. A good place to try some red curry!"}
{"text":"Indian food and ice cream at a great price, what's not to love?

When my friends and I went, we ordered the Gobi Manchurian: which is cauliflower fried in a spicy sauce that makes it taste like spicy buffalo wings, the Chicken Tikka Masala: a classic curry, and the Chicken Biryani: which is a rice dish with spices and slightly spicy.

Ice cream flavors included everything from chai to jackfruit to lychee, and honestly, it was fun talking to the server and tasting all the different flavors! 

There are lots of great Indian food places in Phoenix and Tempe, and if you're looking for a cheap and fun meal, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Sooo good. Got the chicken tikka masala and biryani and omg this was amazing!! The chicken was juicy and tender and the overall spices were so flavorful."}
{"text":"You know how many Indian food jokes I know?
Naan.

Ba-dum-tss!

I am an Indian food noob.  This is my second time trying Indian food after a ten-year hiatus.  The first time I had the cuisine, my body rejected life itself.  Like seriously, I was stuck in the bathroom all night, cursing whatever deity that punished my G.I. with such pain.  I think I aged like 50 years in there and I don't know how I didn't become, \"The Girl That Lives in Her Bathroom.\"  How's that for a visual, yo.

Enough bathroom talk.  Let's talk food!

Vada Pao:  This was fun to eat.  Imagine a giant deep-fried potato fritter/croquette nestled in between a sweet squishy bun.  Top it with a green chili pepper chutney and a sweet dark-colored chutney and it was amazing.  Did you know this is also called a \"Bombay Burger?\"  While delicious, it was way too much for my stomach as we actually received our appetizer at the end of the meal.  

Chicken Curry:  At medium spice, it was a slow steady heat.  The first few bites was an explosion of flavor.  It felt like there were fireworks going off in my mouth and I needed to order some rice to cool off my mouth.  After getting some rice, the heat just continued to grow with every bite.  Towards the end, it was pointed out to me that my complexion went a bit rosy around the cheeks.  Is there alcohol in this?  Am I getting the Asian Flush?  Oh well.  It tasted great and I loved every bite.  The curry was velvety and just all around good eats.

Vegetable Indian Fried Rice:  So since I had chicken in our curry, I went and got vegetables in the fried rice.  I think I'll always get the vegetable fried rice here.  It had deep-fried cauliflower in it which made it fun to eat and gave it a nice texture.  Yum!  I got the rice at a mild heat since I wasn't feeling like absolutely killing myself with Indian spice.

Tikka Fries:  Just get these.  Tikka masala is like Ketchup and Curry's lovechild.  You'll love it!  The fries are even topped with crushed dried chili flakes.  

An applause for the bold and addicting flavors of Curry & Scoop, y'all.  As I type this, I feel an inferno in my stomach and I'm absolutely scared to poop.  Spice isn't a taste but a pain.  The pain is what makes spice so addicting.  I guess I'm a masochist!"}
{"text":"I got the chickpeas & the chicken tikka masala. It was really good. When you get there you aren't really sure if anyone is working or if they open because no one is up front & they stay in the back. I would suggest that they either stay up front or have a loud enough bell to notify them that someone has walked in. This would be nice so you're not just waiting around for someone to help you. The person who came in after me did the same & even asked me if anyone was there. Other than that I really liked the food."}

{"text":"I am committed to dining in locally-owned and specifically south Tempe local restaurants. Curry and Scoop happens to be a gem. They welcomed our request for recommendations. Food was terrific! Gobi Manchurian reminded me of the same dish in one of NYC finest Indian restaurants. Chili Chicken outstanding. 
Portions and pricing = value. Decided to return the following evening to try Speciality Ice Cream - authentic and wonderful flavors. Adding Curry and Scoop to my list of one of South Tempe's best neighborhood restaurants."}
