{"text":"I tried this place based upon the recommendation of a friend. There is no shortage of pizza places in this general area so one has to actually do something different to stand out. I would say Herk's accomplishes this admirably. 

First, they have a nice selection of specialty pizzas I am working my way through. The Longhorn, which is my friend's favorite is quite good and the garlic parm crust is delicious. Other reviewers have mentioned the Dirty Mac and I, having tried it, also recommend you try this abomination. It truly does taste and smell like a Big Mac. My only real complaint about it is that I think it needs a lot more ground beef on it but , as it stands, it raises the interesting realization that, when you eat a Big Mac, you aren't really tasting the meat, but rather everything else such as bun, thousand island, pickles, american cheese, etc. Speaking of crust, this is another thing that sets them apart. The crust has a really nice chew to it and all their pizzas seem to come with some sort of seasoning (the Dirty Mac comes with a sesame seed crust). 

The chicken wings are also quite good and come in a larger variety of flavors than just buffalo and bbq (although the buffalo is good, even if hot buffalo isn't even remotely hot, as was my experience). 

All in all, give it a shot. I have a feeling this is the type of place that you will either really like or really hate. I fall solidly in the former category."}
{"text":"After living in Pittsburgh for 4 years my husband and I have finally found a GREAT pizza place!! We have not yet ordered a specialty pizza, but as far as the regular pizzas go... the ingredients are fresh and delicious, the crust is yummy and the owner and employees are super friendly!  This is definitely our new go to take out joint!"}
{"text":"There's no good pizza in this area which is a shame because our family loves pizza. We thought we'd give Herk's a try since they just opened up and WOW. We got the family deal. Ordered a steak sandwich, carolina tang wings and a pepperoni pizza. They brush the crust with garlic butter and sprinkle parmesan cheese over it. It's like eating a breadstick. The wings were crispy and loaded with sauce. They have a nice selection of flavors too. But the best part was the cheese steak was GRILLED. They actually cook it there instead of slapping a frozen stake-um on some day old bread. 

The food was awesome. Best in the area. The service was friendly and quick and they're not any more expensive than anyone else in town. If you haven't been to Herk's, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best pizza in the Pittsburgh area! No matter how many times you eat it, it is like the first time every time: savory and delicious!"}
{"text":"VISITORS, YOUR SEARCH HAS ENDED! I was traveling down I-79 and needed gas.  Took the nearest exit and happened upon a BP station a mile or so off the freeway.   As I pumped...I saw the OPEN light at Herk's Pizza just up the road.  Hungry with a long 4 hour drive ahead with nothing but bad food options....I decided to try this \"Local\" Pizza joint as I'm apt to do.  I always order a simple Pepperoni pizza when trying out a new place because I think it best shows what the place is about.  First, the 2 folks working were friendly and took my order right away, and even offered up that I could get a Large for the same price as a small with a promotion they had.  Bonus points for not being greedy.  Got out to my car (no seating here)....started my engine and AC....and dug right in to the box.   QUITE SIMPLY THE BEST PIZZA I'VE HAD IN YEARS!!!  From the Classic Pepperoni (the small ones!) to thick layer of cheese, the sauce was spot on and not too heavy/sweet/light, and the garlic buttered and parmesan covered crust......AMAZING!  Will definitely be a part of every trip to Pittsburgh from now on!  YOU FOLKS ARE SO LUCKY!!

{"text":"Amazing pizza. We order from Herk's all the time. Their specialty pizzas are great, like the dirty Mac it is amazing and tastes just like you're eating a Big Mac. The only complaint that I have, my order is never ready on time. I have to admit, it's always worth the wait, but just quote me an honest wait time!!"}
{"text":"What a great pizza place! Yum Yum! I ordered delivery last Friday when I was looking for a non-meat option for lent. I'm very glad that I read the reviews and chose Herk's. We ordered the margherita pizza, side salad and side of haluski. Herk's has sides of haluski and mac n cheese for lent. Great option. The haluski was buttery and delicious. Just like the church ladies used to make it. The side salad was fairly standard for a pizza joint. Iceberg, tomatoes, olives, cheese. The pizza was exactly what I was looking for. Ooey, gooey cheese. Tomatoes. Spinach. And a crispy crust with garlic oil and parm cheese. The crust made the pizza. If you are looking for some great lent options, give Herk's a try. I can't wait to try the other unique options."}
{"text":"update - just ordered another pizza and it came quickly and was tasty. no complaints this time. glad we tried again!"}
{"text":"Herk's is your standard local pizza joint. They sell a good product, but when I called to order something for lunch, the phone was busy, non-stop for about 15 minutes. No matter how good the product is, if I can't get a hold of you, then I can't give you my money! It might be time to invest in an online ordering system, or another phone line."}
{"text":"My LORD! is the Dirty MAC a delicious hot mess of a pizza! It's 1000 Island Dressing, american cheese, ground meat, onions, lettuce, and pickle like Big Mac or Superburger. It doesn't sound oike it would be good but it is. Delivery was fast considering it came from Heidelberg. The fries with bacon, ranch, and cheese were really good also. Docking a point for the bland cinnamon sticks."}
{"text":"Hails to the local Pennysaver tabloid for giving Kay and I another pizza delivery option to explore. Herk's has an astonishing delivery range, one I was told from the driver might be scaled down depending on how things play out, but for now they do deliver to Beechview, and for the most part, we were grateful for the quality grub that came our way.

The Dirty Mac is one of their \"signature pizzas\" and will be a blessing to some and an abomination to others. What it attempts to pull off and succeeds in doing is merging a Big Mac or a Superburger inside a pizza crust framework. Instead of tomato sauce, there is Thousand Island Dressing. In lieu of Mozzarella, you'll get American. Ground beef, onions, pickles,and lettuce shredded into confetti complete the pie.

You, the reader, are hoping that I despised it in the name of good taste.

Well, I didn't. 

Prepare to give up on my work forever.

A marvelous shambles, this Value-Meal-gone-wrong was laid upon an odd, crisped, bronze crust that was peppered with sesame seeds and was scrumptious enough to eat alone. Smoldering, sleazy, sinful, saccharine, and strangely sublime, I've never had a pizza quite like it and doubt I ever will again. Don't let The Clown get a hold of this recipe. 

The Works Fries were also a fresh-cut delight that were topped with a couple of cheeses, bacon, and were seconded by some ranch dressing. I was shocked that they held up as well as they did, tasting fresh from the hot fat despite the relatively long drive. 

Only the Cinnamon Sticks truly disappointed as they merely tasted like stale, leftover pizza dough dusted with sugar 'n spice. 

Dessert aside, Herk's works for me."}
{"text":"Have liked the pizza and wings...was hungry for an Italian hoagie.  Very good hoagie...not as good as my fav...but very good!  Very large hoagie! Very good price!"}
