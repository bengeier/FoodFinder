{"text":"Love this bar. Great chill place for a great cocktail. Bobby and Rosemary are an amazing bartending team!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Rachelle has been our server many times and makes for a fun and delicious experience. Had the first Friday menu with wine pairings by Hidden Tracks Bottle Shop and it was fantastic.  Come by and experience a neighborhood spot with a great Chef!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Food is amazing! Highly suggest the baby back ribs and the pulled pork & chicken. Very friendly staff. We were greeted immediately upon walking in the door. Our waitress Rachelle was very knowledgeable about the drinks & food menu. The host even stopped by our table to ask if we were doing ok. Atmosphere was great. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"wow how disappointing. visited this bar as part of a bar crawl package. where to start. majorly understaffed. imagine booking a hundred plus people in your venue and staffing three bartenders. bouncer was aggressive. finally made it inside. their special was $3 shots, ordered 6 and was charged $50+. bartender shrugged and said she \"heard me wrong\" not sure how that works but okay. ordered food and waited nearly an hour just to receive cold fried food. if you're looking to be overcharged and under valued I highly recommend this establishment. If you have some respect for yourself and the people you're with I'd recommend a jack in the box before this place. steer clear."}
{"text":"We ordered food from Chambers and it was delicious. Perfect meal and will definitely visit the restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders and great service. Down to earth vibe, superior food! Try the steak, try the fish n' chips, try it all!  This is my new spot downtown."}
{"text":"Came in for a beer and got immediate service. Waiter and bartender were great. Very nice place."}
{"text":"Our first stop here was with friends and we had drinks and appetizers. Both the food & service were great. We tried the pretzel with mustard dip and the wings.   We went back to have dinner and it was delicious!  The steak dinner was cooked exactly as ordered and it was very good. One of us got a full rack of ribs and split it between the spicy bbq and the Carolina tangy bbq. Both were fabulous and the spicy bbq isn't too spicy...just enough to be tangy and have great flavor.   Along with the fantastic food, the service was EXCELLENT!  We were hanging out watching basketball and the waitress (Dem) was very attentive while letting us know there was no rush.  She was awesome!    We went out for a nice, big dinner and we were not disappointed!  We'll be back for this and for happy hour, for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this little neighborhood joint.  It's \"Cheer's\" in downtown Phoenix.     Best wait staff ever! Rochelle is the bomb!     Warning: stand up nights does attract local yokels!  Open mic comedy is a mixed blessing but always worth the time!    Best thing: a better scotch selection than most places In downtown."}
{"text":"Late lunch on a Sunday. Service was good. Ribs were good, beer was also good but a tad pricy ($7). The hammer was $10 for pretzels. Regardless, the place was pretty dumpy: seats were OLD, cushions were MOLDY and filthy, made us want to wash our hands AFTER the meal. With so many more choices in PHX center, methinks not again!!!"}
{"text":"Drinks were great! Christy Moore-McClendon (bartender) was rude, but sexy & overall fanfuckingtastic!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place for brunch and happy hour! The cute young bartender Rosemary is really great at keeping people happy and entertained and can make some killer drinks! I see some bad reviews for this place and I'm truly confused, all the changes that have been made have definitely added class to the establishment but it remains to be a local favorite because of an awesome staff and great selection of beer and scotch. Best patio in downtown Phoenix, especially on a lovely day like today. Definitely recommend for dates or meetings, or if you just want a friendly face to talk to."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last night after a couple of other places downtown were a bust. Great atmosphere inside and everyone working was so friendly and nice. The soft, warm pretzel served with hot cheese was like a meal in itself. My son and I both ordered the sliced rib eye sandwich, 30 minutes later the server came out to tell us they only had enough rib eye for one sandwich which was okay but I wish we had be told this before waiting so long. I did have a bite of his ribeye sandwich and it was good enough I'll come back to get my own."}
{"text":"The staff are mostly the same as the previous owners. They are friendly & helpful especially the bartender. She's great. The over haul had some of the same heavy dark carved woods & beautiful floors. Nothing too shocking on the re-do. Wish both stalls in the ladies room worked but they still don't unfortunately. Can't say how the food is as we didn't try it. Just cruised in for a cocktail on a Friday p.m. I'll update the review if/when I try the fare."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices and MNF deals. We tried many of the appetizers and they were all great!! Sliders, fries, bacon wrapped jalapeños, pepperoni bites. Plenty of good beers and an extensive drink menu."}
{"text":"We came here for the urban ale trail... This was the best experience we had all day! They were so attentive and made sure even the line outside was provided with snacks and water before beer was available. Once inside the servers were constantly checking in and serving more to make sure EVERYONE in the place was treated well!"}
{"text":"Burger was soooo good! Cheesecake is delicious. Fries not my fave, but overall very pleased!"}
{"text":"Basically, Rosemary the bartender makes Chambers rock. I'd give HER 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Comfort food that that's warms the soul and delights your taste buds. The fish and chips were amazing and the bartenders are hot! Excellent customer service with a smile. Good company and great food!"}
{"text":"Awful food awful service go somewhere else...worst burgers dry cheese cake dry dry ck tenders....seriously how do they stay in biz...believe it or not twin peaks has seriously good"}
{"text":"Great bar, they carried Moscato, been all over looking for it. The bartender was great, friendly, and did a great job."}
{"text":"Greated with a warm hello. Server was pleasant, but was semi knowledgeable about the menu, it was her first day.  Once food arrived there was instant disappointment. Yelp pictures created an anticipation that was not fulfilled. Medium burger was well, flavors did not match the description."}
{"text":"Last night our party of 18 had a great meal and excellent service at Chambers.  I made reservations a month in advance and they were happy to take it,  accommodate a large party,  separate checks, and no gratuity added. Everyone in our party expressed how pleased they were with the food,  the service,  the process,  and the environment. THANK YOU for adding to our great night out."}
{"text":"The newly-renovated and debuted Chambers has a lush interior, with more room to dance now that the VIP section has been removed. The food is amazing, especially the crab cakes. I was lucky enough to be there to also see the debut of Mike and the Lucky Strikes, an extremely talented band with a full horn section. Perfect place to chill with your friends and hear great music."}
{"text":"They had just opened when I came here and they handed everyone a $15 giftcard. How awesome is that?! FREE DRINKS YES!  Me and my friend ordered a couple of wine and whiskey with coke and a lot of water (to stay hydrated, you know.) The bartenders attended to our needs right away each time. They never left us hanging. Cool!   This place has live music and is small. I think they need to turn the music down being that the area is small and it makes it louder.  Cleanliness was pretty up to par. :)"}
{"text":"Alix is an awesome bartender. So is Bobby. So is Dana. So is Rochelle. Actually everyone that works there are just fantastic people."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Rochelle (maybe Rachelle?) is a tasty babe to the max.  She has awesome hair and a winning personality. Great music and vibe. Come here or else!"}
{"text":"Just discovered Chambers on First.  Nice atmosphere great happy hour and nice menu with lots of choices and very tasty too."}
{"text":"Went here for a girls night after we worked up an appetite while wandering around First Friday. The place is very nice, what I would call \"fancy, but comfortable\". Would be a perfect place for a date night. The wait staff were friendly, the food was delicious (I had the crab cakes), and the live music was really, really good. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Cool, laid back vibe with amazing service and drink selection. Not to mention live music. Must see!"}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday afternoon for some drinks and to watch some football.  This place is essentially the same as when it was the Turf except they got rid of the horse betting machines and awkward stage.  Nice atmosphere, super friendly staff and good drinks too!"}
{"text":"Relatively dead for the semi-finals football games. Couldn't hear the sound at all, then bartender turned it up very loudly, and no muting during the ads. Prompt service, good wings. Also ordered nachos, and they were totally flavorless. Chips were stale, no spice, some ground meat (maybe chicken?). It's a great space, they just need to pay attention to the reviews!"}
{"text":"Umm.. I had a not-so-good experience here. I went on a Friday early evening expecting an amazing happy hour, but it was quite the contrary. It was not busy at all for a Friday. This should have been a warning sign. My server was AWFUL. She couldn't even tell what the happy hour specials were. They were also not printed on any menu. It took her about 15 minutes to even tell me what was on special. She appeared listless and disheveled. Maybe even high. The happy hour specials were basically only $1-3 off the original price, which was pretty disappointing. The food was NOT good at all. It was fried bar type food, which lacked seasoning, freshness, and appeal. The plates looked very sad. We struggled through our meal and then server shorted me on my change. Needless to say, I won't be back. I'm only giving one star for the ambiance, which did not match the food or service. They won't last like this. Too many good places to eat downtown."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  However the aesthetic is really no different than the dumpy old Turf that it used to be.  Also, 9 dollars for a pint of Grapefruit Sclupin.  Ha!  This isn't Los Angeles.  Go to Angels Trumpet.  It's cheaper, easier on the eyes and they have more than one person serving."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! Ordered the Fish and Chips. The chips (fries) were rubbery and cold. The fish has ZERO flavor and they use tarter sauce from a can. Absolute trash of a restaurant."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Chambers, great service and great food. Happy hour is the time to go, half off wine and appetizers. I ordered the quesadillas and smoked chicken wing. The order of quesadillas came with a salsa. I wasn't impressed with the salsa it tasted very similar to marinara sauce. My mom enjoyed the salsa, she said it did not taste like marinara. The order of quesadillas was filing enough. I ordered the smoked chicken wing because I am a huge fan of wings. The wings were small in size, didn't have much meat on dem bones. 4 out of 5 overall I do recommend you try this joint out. I would go back!"}
{"text":"I got to stop by this place during the recent Urban Wine Walk event. First off, way to go running the event - it was well organized and well staffed. Great ambiance here; like a cool lounge. Nice sized patio and friendly service. I'd love to visit this place again for dinner. During our visit I heard them announce they do wine tastings some times too; sounds like a good excuse to go out to me."}
{"text":"Phoenix can be a lonely city but planted firmly in the middle of this loneliness are a few places one might easily miss but shouldn't.  Downtown Phoenix, in particular, boasts some of the more friendlier and refreshing bars and eateries in the valley.  Three years ago, I stumbled upon Chambers On First and kind of never left.  Simply put, it's Cheers smack dab in the middle of a city where no one really knows your name and if you've ever arrived in an unfamiliar landscape with that sentiment and found a place where you are immediately and always welcome, then you'll know what I'm saying.  The drink selection is plentiful, the food is far above par but the most appealing and unforgettable part of Chambers, is the dedication of the staff who truly always knows your name.   Thank you to the entire Chambers crew for making me feel at home right from the start.  You guys simply rock.  Love always."}
{"text":"This is clearly a hidden gem!  The food is absolutely off the chain!!!  We have been four days in a row!  It's hard to decide what to order as everything is amazing and you'll find yourself ordering more than one item!  The ribs are the best we've had, amazing chicken wings, fried pickles are bomb, shaved rib eye sandwich with au jus is crazy delish and crazy enough the best hummus I've had in a restaurant!  Staff are kind and great service - calling out Tiffany as she is great, cool atmosphere.  Once you go, you'll be a regular, trust me!  This restaurant rocks and they have great happy hour too!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Chambers to have a drink with some friends and we had a wonderful server. Kelly took care of us and kept the drinks flowing. Would definitely come in again."}
{"text":"We popped in after a very underwhelming experience at Pomo's next door. I don't regret going here at all! Kelly was a great waitress. Even though she the only waitress in the joint, she acknowledged us soon after we sat down. She told us in a friendly manner she'd be right with us as she headed to tend to another table. That type of acknowledgement is all I ever ask for from restaurant staff. The drinks and food, decor and overall environment was perfect! I've never had wings so good! Will definitely return and recommend others as well!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Chambers. It's charming and quite fun! I have a great time every time I go there. The bartender and waitstaff are very attentive. Not only is the food amazing but the drinks were unique and very yummy too! I had the blueberry mule which was absolutely delicious. After trying mine the rest of the table ended up ordering one as well. And don't even get me started on the breaded mozzarella balls!  100% would definitely recommend this place to anybody!"}
{"text":"Chambers was really pleasantly surprising! My husband and I went about 5pm during the week. I know it was an odd time, but we were the only people in there. The server let us know that it was happy hour until 7 and all appetizers were half off. Score.   We ordered three appetizers to share and our bill totaled $19. Amazing.  We had sliders, zucchini and a quesadilla. The quesadilla was a little weird, although not bad, and the server did warn us that it wasn't a traditional quesadilla. It has raw onions, rice, jalapeño cream cheese and chicken inside. Not my favorite combination but it didn't offend me either.   The atmosphere inside is dark and stuffy feeling but it is decorated well. There is a patio that is west facing. It was 110 out when we visited so we decided not to sit on the patio even if there were misters. We didn't feel like baking our brains that day.   I will definitely visit again to try more of the regular menu items. The service is excellent and both girls who helped us were sweet and seemed to like their jobs. I can't believe I've been eating at angels trumpet right across the street for all this time and I've never seen this place! It's definitely worth a visit especially for some delicious and cheap happy hour  snacks."}
{"text":"Chambers was not our first choice. Or our second. It was a last-ditch effort to watch the Dodgers lose in game 7. And man, did that add to the experience.   What restaurant isn't packed on a Wednesday night? In all seriousness, we were allowed to pick our seat in front of the projector, were diligently and patiently waited on all night, and the apps weren't terrible either.  If I'm in the area again I'll have to try out their dining experience instead of pretending they're a sports bar."}
{"text":"I was here for a special event (FA Cup Soccer Final, Sunday 9AM), so maybe not the best description of Chambers on a regular day or night. Regardless, I think this place and its people are awesome! Located in downtown Phoenix, but when you walk in you get the UK feels right away. Chambers has the Phoenix Blues (Chelsea supporters) in on game days. Sometimes it is a small crowd, but this was a big game, with over 100 supporters in attendance. Although they seemed a bit surprised by the large crowd, the staff handled everything exceptionally well. I didn't catch the bartenders name but she busted her ass both setting up and serving. They have a decent draft list, with many pub regulars (Harp, Stella, etc...) and a few AZ beers mixed in (Papago, Oak Creek.) The bar and pub layout is spacious with plenty of room to get around. It looks like there is a small stage where live music takes place. I will be back to Chambers to check out the regular vibe, and hit the menu!"}
{"text":"Chambers, my hat's off to YOU!  During the scrum that is the annual City of Phx's Urban Ale Trail event 2 weeks ago, you had terrific foresight to have quite adequately staffed your restaurant/pub for our fervent crowd.  Your servers took great care of us sweaty pub-crawlers and really did a great job of making sense out of our senselessness!  I miss the Turf Bar, but, wait, not anymore, raise a glass to Chambers, and see what I am talking about!"}
{"text":"So today's visit was specifically to watch a soccer match at 9:30 AM. Nice location being that its in downtown phoenix, just a pain when it comes to looking for parking and having to pay to park. Either way the selection of beers on tap was typical with a pub. I unfortunately did not have an appetite to eat but next time will make an effort to try out there breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"Can't give 5 stars as I only ordered drinks but went with friends very chill atmosphere friends enjoyed the food a little pricey but overall good experience"}
{"text":"Popped in for some lunch in this inconspicuous lounge.  This restaurant has a nice lounge feel with a cool, relaxed Irish-gothic vibe, including some swanky chandeliers.  Per my bartender, Rachelle's, recommendation, I ordered the sliced ribeye sandwich with au jus with waffle fries.   It was a very tasty sandwich with crispy fries.  A very nice lounge with fantastic, attentive service.!"}
{"text":"Chambers has good food. Lots of good beers too on drafts! Staff is friendly, live music, chill hangout spot."}
{"text":"My friends and i came to watch the Bears & Packers game, only one of our members has been here before and suggested it as a regular game-watch spot. That friend was absolutely correct!!! Our wings were super tasted, I personally got Ruben Sliders and they too are wonderful!!! Great time"}
{"text":"Randomly chose this place to eat and it was excellent. The service was great, the food was yummy, awesome atmosphere, chill cool place with a nice bar. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what they are trying to do here. It appears that they are trying to make the transition from Turf and make it into an upscale bar and I'm not sure it works. It's basically a nice bar with bar food fare."}
{"text":"Good people, good food! A great neighborhood pub. With lots of other places in the area, if you have never been in the downtown Phoenix area, take it from a local, check out north downtown and start at Chambers!"}
{"text":"Came in late late night and it seems to be the gathering place for industry people at 2am! Wonderful patrons. In and outdoor seating. Lots of street parking. Love the local draft pint selections.  Late night food is available with sides. I got a toasted white bread tuna melt with a side of cottage cheese. Pal had a beautifully charred marked chicken sandwich with a cole slaw side that he ate all up first."}
{"text":"My hangout for Chelsea matches with the Phoenix Blues. Good food, great beer with friendly service. A place to go for a relaxed spot in downtown PHX."}
{"text":"Mostly locals, quality homemade comfort food, friendly staff, and positive vibes (eclectic, varied customers - everyone is open-minded).  It's sometimes a little slow, but that don't let that bother you - this is definitely a neighborhood restaurant.  Weekend nights it gets pretty packed, especially when ASU students are around, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Chelsea game this morning and had a blast. We sat at the bar and were offered breakfast and lunch menus. My husband ordered the breakfast burrito with sausage and it came with some potatoes. I ordered the chicken strips that did not come with a side and we both enjoyed our meals. Well vodka was some off brand and was $6, the next level up was $8 so sadly this isn't a place I would go to drink but they had plenty of tv's and big screens and a rambunctious soccer (futball) crowd singing chants and hooting and hollering. Fun atmosphere and artwork on the walls. Service was disorganized but overall timely. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Downtown Phx bar and grill ! Have been going downtown for 35 + years. Best service, friendly, great food. My new spot for lunch. Thumbs up to Chambers !!"}
{"text":"Attentive wait staff, great food, and the perfect atmosphere. Rosemary and Demery go above and beyond to make my Saturday mornings here more than enjoyable. If you are looking for a quiet brunch spot with chill music and BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS AND BLOODY MARY'S FROM 10 AM - 2PM this is it. As a person that can find the negative elements in any situation, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Chambers or their employees. This is exactly what downtown phoenix needs."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink after a Pops concert. Friendly hostess and bar staff, cool decor, interesting menu. Was described to us as an \"Irish Pub\". Ok I see the parallel but this place is more. Observed several interesting dishes enjoyed by fellow bar patrons. I cannot wait to return to enjoy them myself. As a man who knows a bit about shrimp I saw the shrimp and chips dish and it killed me not to try that night. I will be back soon to enjoy the food!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, drinks were perfect, and food was great (the pretzel could've be better if it was softer but it was still good). They have a nice patio out from as well"}
{"text":"4.50 for 4 spears of asparagus...the veggie burger was pretty good for a place like this actually but I was really hoping for the pretzel bun that was on the minis. The nectar of the god drink was delicious! My friends didn't like their ribs at all, friend thought her pasts was ok, and other friend was obsessed w her salad. Gave 3 stars for the AMAZING service."}
{"text":"Thia bar was like a classy pub. Loved the pictures on the wall and the decor and vibe of this place. It was dead, we nearly had the whole place to ourselves. Our server was attentive and made good suggestions for my drinks. I'm trying to get into whiskey so the server suggested a flight. I went with the Mac Attack; it was 3 shot size servings of Macallan 12,15, & 18. I loved them all and got a whiskey ginger as well. They had a great selection of whiskeys and other crafted cocktails. My sister got the ribs and loved them she said the meat literally fell off the bone. Bonerific! I loved the slaw that came with the ribs too. The fried pickles were meh but you can't really go wrong with fried pickles. Anyways, overall we loved this place. Great location, food, drinks, & service. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because they charge 50¢ for extra ranch! And we weren't told about the extra cost."}
{"text":"What a great place. Fantastic happy hour, decent craft beer choice, great food. Large selection of Scotch, Bourbons/ whiskeys, tequila. ..you name it. Excellent wings and bar food. Bartender Rosemary was the highlight.  Beautiful smile with fantastic service.  Will definitely go back when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Chicken was mediocre at best. The service was ok but nothing special. I think the bartender had friends in to watch the game. They seemed to have all his attention. I'd go back for drinks but not if I wanted good food and service."}
{"text":"Food was decent. I got a patty melt and my friend got pulled pork sliders. No complaints there!  Beer prices are absurd though. Got two Ballast Point IPAs and they came out to $9 each. Not sure how they justify that but I am not sure I'll be back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a going-away luncheon for a close friend and fellow co-worker... So glad I did! The food was Great! The drinks were just what we needed on a hot day and the place was just as I hoped it would be (based my judgements off the pictures).. quiet, cozy, great decor and atmosphere.. and the staff was attentive. But not too much that we had to pause our conversations and such.. I'll be taking my hubby here for a date night next time we are in the downtown area! Truly loved it!"}
{"text":"Chambers on First is a excellent neighborhood pub! Awesome staff! We spent our New Year's Day there with friends enjoying football, the draft specials, and the $5 burgers which are especially the best deal in town! Our bartender, Rachelle, is wonderful and did a great job! This is why we go there!  We always tell friends that everyone needs to check out Chambers for weekend breakfasts, lunch and happy hour specials! They will be happy that they did! Wishing everyone a Happy New Year... and you gotta go to Chambers!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly but super slow especially for a downtown lunch spot. People are on a time schedule! Food took forever and my Reuben was cold and soggy on the bottom and not enough cheese, fries were fine. My friends chicken sandwich was good, fries were cold. Underwhelming patty melt, the bread was way bigger than the patty and not grilled or cheesy and gooey enough. Her mushroom risotto was good though."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this place since it was Turf. The name changed and so did the interior, but the business itself did not.  Firstly, the renovations are great. This place still very much is a pub....with fancy chandeliers. I'm not sure what the owner is going for. But I like chandeliers so hey, can't really complain there.  I've only been here late at night but my most recent visit was a few weekends ago. For a Saturday night, this place wasn't all that busy.   One of the major factors in making a decision as to what bar to go to is whether they serve food. Chambers does have a late night menu and is one of the only downtown bars that does. They offer standard bar fare, however as a vegetarian who was quite hungry it was unfortunate that their main dish menu had 0 vegetarian options. The only things available were on the appetizer menu and consisted of fried items/hummus. Its understandable that you wouldn't have a lot to pick from on a late night menu but I think at least offering a veggie burger might be a thing to consider in the future. According to the menu, they do have a black bean burger so I'm not sure how much trouble it would be to add that to the late night menu. I ordered the hummus which was alright.   The other issue I have is with the variety of beers and the price of said beers. I feel, just as I did with Turf--the same. It is overpriced, on average about $7-$8 for a beer that I could get a for about $5 elsewhere. I'm really into craft beer and have a fairly good grasp on how much standard local beer costs at nearby establishments. It's kind of a disappointment.   Overall, I think the bar has a great aesthetic but misses the mark where it matters-the food & drinks."}
{"text":"Being new to Phoenix, I've been on a quest to find new places to eat and to consider my \"go-to's.\" Chambers is most certainly one of them. First of all, they have  a patio, which I took advantage of on a rare occasion 70-degree evening in May. Second, they have an extensive cocktail, beer, and wine menu. Third (and almost most-importantly) they know how to cook a steak medium rare and sautée vegetables to perfection. So, what is most important? Easy answer: all of this is a mere 5-minute walk from my new Phoenix home.  Is Chambers one of my new \"go-to's?\" He'll yeah!"}
{"text":"Not a very impressive place.  I can over look the dingy old tired look of the place, the strange smell! The film on the beer glass! But I can't over look the rude bar tender and how unacommadative she was about putting an NFL game on, especially the home team.  Plus the televisions are out of focus and no matter where you sit there isn't a good viewing location.  There are better bars for drinks eats and fun, I'd recommend Angels Trumpet House, Corduroy's or even Durants! All within walking distance!"}
{"text":"The food is surprisingly good! The reason for the 3 stars are because of the service and the decor. Its confusing, it has pub aspects but it's not a pub. They had an Irish band but they don't wanna be a pub. IDK... The servers were a little lost. Difficult to get a hold of them and when we did they ask if who our server was. It happened a few times. I think it is a new staff and they are just getting the hang of it. However the food is good. We ordered all of the appetizers and they were awesome."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm very very impressed by the food here. I got their pasta and substituted shrimp (instead of chicken. It was cooked in a white wine sauce,  and flavorful as promised: Garlicky, rich and the mushrooms were sauteed perfectly. And the bread, for some reason, was really delicious also. I'm not a huge bread fan but I want to say it was grilled and olive oil which definitely made all the difference.   Then let's talk about that chocolate cake! Extremely rich and decadent. Oh my goodness!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Decided to give it a go. Ended up being a Great Lunch! Enjoyed the Ribeye sandwich & a entree Salad. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! It's our go to place and never disappointed. Rochelle is a phenomenal waitress. I hope you get her:) the food is delicious and they always accommodate picky eaters. Plus whiskey selection is amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a whim.  I was liked the casual bar vibe, but I was impressed with the friendly service and my lunch choice of a Reuben sandwich and squash bisque.  It was perfect, and what I hoped for.  My wife loved her bacon cheese burger.  This place a winner for those who want a nice casual lunch, but restaurant quality."}
