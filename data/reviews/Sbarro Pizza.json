{"text":"I ordered a slice of Hawaiian pizza. It was cheap for airport food , about $5.50. It was almost tasteless and pretty slim on the toppings. I guess you get what you pay for and I gave it three stars because it was a generous slice and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Greasy, over-priced, fast food, chain store...please...don't waste your money."}
{"text":"How did this place get here?  I thought it was US only.  Anyhoo, it is a very limited menu compared to their usual offerings but,  thankfully they have the $5.29 sausage stuffed two-crust pizza.  When that thing is covered with Sbarro boil-in-bag sauce, it is a damn fine bit of processed food.  Too bad they don't have the brocolli and spinach stuffed two-crust, that thing is worthy of more stars.  Too bad they don't have chintzy American beer like Miller High Life, that would earn something also."}
{"text":"Best and ONLY NYC style chain for delicious, thin, foldable, cheesy and greasy goodness!!! Not for the whiny Sicilian/dry sauce filled Chicago style pizza lovers that like to choke on a ton of dough! Wish Sbarro or a NEW chain like it had more locations!"}
{"text":"Sbarro's is too greasy-the pizza that is. I enjoyed the salad and my friend liked the pasta that she got. I can only imagine how many calories are in a slice of their cheese pizza!"}
{"text":"Bland, over cooked from multiple reheatings pizza. Around $5 a slice isn't too bad for airport priced food, but that's about as good as it gets."}
