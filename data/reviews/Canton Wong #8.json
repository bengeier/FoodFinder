{"text":"Worst place ever. Very terrible food. Five stars reviews are misleading.
Order orange and sesame  chicken, wonton soup and chow mien all taste horrible.
Even the soda and hot te had a nasty flavor as if they used to much Raid spray.
The place it self should be a warning but we read some good reviews  about the place and had five stars but that was not my experience at all."}
{"text":"Hard to find delivery in south Phoenix except for pizza. We gave it a shot. We tried calling but it went straight to voicemail. Waited a couple of minutes and tried again. Delivery was an hour wait. We went for it anyways. They showed up 40 minutes late. 

The food was very good including the wait. we will definitely try again. I could tell they were busy. Very happy to have one more choice in south phoenix/lavern"}
{"text":"I love this place! The workers here are super friendly ;) Delivery is always so quick and everything I've tried is yummy-yum!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best chinese food you can get delivered. There aren't a lot of options in south phoenix for delivery, but if you are in canton wong's delivery area, i highly recommend them. The food is delicious, portions are large, and the price is cheap. i love the wonton soup and the fried rice. Haven't ordered anything i didn't like!"}
{"text":"We didnt feel like going out and decided to order in.  Compared to most delivery restaurants of this style, we were happy not to get a salt bomb for a meal.  Only quibbles were ordering two larges and only getting one rice and their online menu not being accurate with regards to pricing.  Good flavor on the Kung pao."}
{"text":"Decent food, when in the mood for Chinese I go here. Sometimes I even have it delivered. Food is good and service is great."}
{"text":"Considering that finding delivery in South Phoenix is nearly impossible, this place is a gem. We stopped in to get take out because they do not have an online menu, and we were rather pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food, not to mention the great prices... Under $4 for lunch??? Seriously!.  The staff was friendly and the food was quickly prepared and hot when we drove it home.  We would order from here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"My roommate and I order from here a lot because its the only Chinese place near us that delivers to us. And I have to say, as broke college students, this is not bad. Not great but not bad. For the price, its worth it. All my orange, chicken, gen taos chicken, and others like it have been crunchy and great with a bowl of rice. Their pork fried rice is pretty good. I do think their chow mien is very oily and if you order a dish w/ meat and veggies, they tend to tip the scale with more veggies than meat. But over all my experience has been favorable. We always get the fried wontons and crab puffs. NOTE CRAB PUFFS ARE JUST CREAM CHEESE WONTONS! lol. Delivery is on point though, food has never been cold and arrives fast enough. Been there once, probably wouldn't eat there because the vibe feels kinda weird to me."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was really good.  Was skeptical cause of the building, but the menu looked good and prices were reasonable.  Ordered take out and had a Orange Chicken Dinner special....portions were huge..lots of chicken...three times more than you would get at Panda express..the Sauce was not spicy at all...which was disapointing"}
{"text":"Great food. Always ordered delivery. Very nice people and have never had a problem. Quick service! Small or large parties can order from here and everyone loved the food."}
{"text":"If you want food poisoning I'd highly recommend the Sweet and Sour Chicken! Won't ever order from here again"}
{"text":"I ordered food today at 12:20 and didn't receive my order till 2:05. My food was Luke warm at best, greasy and not worth my $20!!! Needless to say I will never be ordering from this Chinese restaurant ever again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Chinese delivery in south Phoenix, you betcha! Good food, ample portions, quick efficent delivery - my kind of place. I ordered the seasame chicken and potstickers, both were excellent and delivered while still piping hot."}
{"text":"Arrived on time, still hot. Cream puffs were still crisp.  My daughter ate all of it and she's five. I got teriyaki chicken and a large orange chicken and cream puffs. Less than 20 Bucks! Yummy too! We still have a good sized helping or two for leftovers"}
{"text":"The chicken fried rice is delicious! It's very flavorful. They also have the best, huge jalape√±o wings!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery almost 2 hours ago. I was originally told 45 mins. I called twice to be told the driver is on his way. I live 5 miles from this place. The woman who I finally talked to said that I was being unreasonable and that I needed to wait another 20 mins or so. She was willing to cancel my order so I know it wasn't on its way and that's almost 2 hours after ordering. This is the 2nd time I've ordered from them, the first wasn't that good to have to put up with being bullied on a order one puts on their credit card...tell them you pay cash maybe that'll help!"}
{"text":"I WILL NOT eat here ever again!!! I used to love this place great specials, delivery and good chinese food. The last and final time I ordered from here I got my delivery order and found a handful of baby roaches in my chow mein, that was 3 years ago. I have not eaten here since and I never will return"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised that food was hot and delicious each time.  I enjoyed the combo rice minus pork, kung pao chicken and shrimp and the orange chicken made spicy.  My  friend had the beef and broccoli said it was very good.  I don\"t live that far away yet delivery really takes the 35-40min wait they say...I like to think this has a lot to do with the hot fresh made when you order factor:)"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood Chinese dive.  Don't let the looks fool you - the owners are friendly, the food is good, and there's plenty of it.  I always tell myself I'm going to try something new, but I just can't ever get past the Kung Pao Two, which is my favorite (the owner always knows what I'm getting before I even order).  I've tried a taste of other dishes when there with my sis & her family, and have never tasted anything I didn't like.  Oh, and the egg rolls are PERFECT (at least I think they are)."}
{"text":"If I have to order for delivery, my choices are limited. I try not to order pizza, because the pizza in Arizona sucks. With that said, I love to order Chinese, and this place not only delivers on time, but with good prices and great food. If you order over 20 dollars, the delivery is free, and that is a bonus. I love their egg rolls, always hot and a great taste. Did I mention the rice is never dry and old? Friendly service, and fast on time delivery makes this place my favorite for Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious. The only problem I have is that the customer service is not always great and the dining area looks old and dirty all the time. The prices are well worth it for the food you get!"}
{"text":"We live in South Phoenix and were craving chinese food so decided to give this place a try.  Decided to call in our order to take out so we could check out the joint.  The lady on the phone was polite and wasn't hard to understand (had that problem with other places) and said our order would be ready in 10 mins.  Sweet.

Just about every place in this area looks a little sketchy - thats normal.  The inside was very clean and had lots of seating.  Got there to pick up the order, before paying, the young lady reviewed the order which I thought was extra nice.  The owner, I assume, gave me our bags of food and was really nice.

My husband and I decided to get one each of chicken, beef and pork and share (with lots of leftovers!!!).  The orange chicken was good, and the breading wasn't too crispy, which is a plus.  The beef broccoli was delicious!  I thought all beef broccoli was the same, but this meat was so flavorful and seasoned amazingly!  The Mu Shu pork was the best!  Seriously, the best mu shu I've had.  Ever."}
{"text":"One the best (hands down) Chinese places in south phoenix!!! Great prices for huge amounts of food. Love the lunch/dinner combos they have. You can get a dinner combo for under $10. They give you so much food you can't eat it alone. Me and my girlfriend always share the sweet and sour chicken dinner combo and we never finish it. You can call in orders and pick them up in \"15 mins or less\" (as the Chinese lady states)

Small restaurant but very comfortable and family oriented. Not crowded like other places; so you will sit down right when you walk in. 

The only thing I really dislike is the chicken wings. I feel like they fry them too long and in old oil. I ate one before and it hurt my tummy. I would NOT recommend the fried chicken 

Overall good little Chinese spot."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Hot & fresh food. Dinner specials, too! 
Tried delivery three times. Each time my food was fresh and piping hot.
Pork fried rice is bomb."}
{"text":"This place is great. And the owners are friendly, which can be hard to find. What makes this place the best is that they deliver. And their Sizzling Rice Seafood soup is delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered the house chicken lunch special, which was ok. I ate in and noticed a strong unpleasant smell when I walked in. Not sure what it was. The staff was really friendly and the lunch special is a good value."}
{"text":"Impressive!  I'm deducting a star, because the place is not a very comfortable dining experience and I think they needed more help.  

The food was five star.  Dad ordered the almond chicken. I ordered the szechuan chicken and an order of mixed vegetables (which I didn't need because both chicken dishes came with a healthy portion of veggies).  But, everything was really, really good (for the super-cheap price).  The food was hot and prepared quickly.  

The place got busy quickly after we got our food.  They did seem understaffed, so I'm not sure how they typically run this place.  Next time, I will order takeout and call before.  Definitely a keeper!!"}
{"text":"Actually a very good place to get Chinese food. I personally do not like the common Chinese food places so I try other ones and this one seems to be a cook to order which is better. My orange chicken, white rice, and tasty chow mein noodles are hot and fresh. The only thing that is not so great is that this place is a bit difficult to find and may not seem like a restaurant."}
{"text":"As Kristin C. noted, this place is now called Canton Wong #8.  

We tried Canton Wong for the first time last night, and based on our first experience, I think it warrants a solid 3+ stars.  We called in an order of Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken, Egg Fried Rice, and Crab (or maybe 
just Cream Cheese?) Puffs on the way home from our kickboxing class.  Kind of defeats the purpose of the kickboxing class, I guess, except that we probably would have eaten the Chinese anyway.

I must admit that I was skeptical about Canton Wong #8 because of the location and the *extremely* low prices, and when the man on the phone told us that our order would be ready for pickup in 5 minutes, my skepticism grew.  Needless to say that when we arrived to find that the front door of the restaurant was locked, I started to think that I should have trusted my instincts and stayed away.

Luckily, after beginning to follow arrows painted on the building around a dimly lit alley that led past the dumpsters, we heard someone opening the front door to let us in.  The inside of the restaurant is nothing fancy, but appeared clean.  Everyone working there was very friendly, and they also told us that they've expanded their delivery to include our development and others south of Dobbins.  Everything we ordered--which was more than enough to serve as dinner for two last night *and* lunch for two today--came to less than $20, and the crab/cream cheese puffs mentioned above came free with our order of more than $15.

Relative to my expectations, the food was amazing.  Both the beef and chicken were high-quality, nothing was too greasy, and despite eating much more than I should have, I didn't feel gross after the meal.  Judged more objectively, the food was good but not great.  None of our dishes was particularly flavorful, and I was disappointed to find that the Mongolian Beef--billed as spicy on the menu--was utterly bland.

These caveats aside, I'm thrilled to have found a solid neighborhood (Americanized) Chinese delivery place.  Note, too, that Canton Wong #8 has an unbelievable lunch special; entrees start at about $3.50, and combos pairing an entree with steamed or fried rice and an eggroll run a seriously affordable $4.15.

Next time, I plan to ask for my food to be prepared extra spicy.  If Canton Wong #8 is able to oblige, it will definitely merit a 4th star."}
{"text":"I got delivery today for my daughters sleepover birthday party.  I was impressed and so were the kids and adults.  I wanted to get a big variety so that each child could have something they enjoy.  We had:
Beef with Broccoli - $7.50 (the large size was smaller than other items)
Bean Curd Family Style (veggie) - $6/25 (large size smaller than others but pretty tasty)
Fried Wonton (10) - $3.15 
Cream Puff (10) - kids really liked - gone right away
Cashew Chicken - $6.99 (large size smaller than others)
Orange Chicken - $6.99 - seriously huge and the first thing to be eaten all gone
Teriyaki Chicken - $6.99 - huge and very popular item
Vegetable Fried Rice - $5.59 (large size smaller than others)
Vegetable Egg Foo Young - $6.75 - huge and delicious.  kids weren't impressed but i was
Vegetable Chop Suey - $6.55 (large size smaller than others) This wasn't my favorite item
2 Vegetable Chow Mein - $6.55 - huge and the kids loved it.  both big ones were gone fast
Chicken Fried Rice - free for spending $25 with coupon on their website.  One little girl loved it.

Total bill was $82.97 to feed 13 kids and 4 adults with tons of leftovers in the fridge.  Great deal!  Took 45 minutes for delivery on a Saturday night at 4:30 PM."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here for the first time today.  Food was pretty good, prices are totally reasonable, and they have a lot of choices.  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"canton wong#8 is amazing  keep it up love the food:) love the food:):) !!! keep it up:):):)   thank you guys your the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"The price is fair, the service is good, and on a Friday evening the wait is forever, but the food is worth it. Amazing!! The best tasting Chinese food in town. Call ahead and be sure and order some won tons with your meal. Thank me later."}
{"text":"My favorite go-to for lazy days when I don't want to cook. The whole menu is AWESOME i try something different all the time and I am NEVER disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is always hot, fresh, and delicious. Service is quick. It's our go-to Chinese restaurant. Especially because they deliver."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall, blink and you passed it, but man their food is so freaking good! Love their food!"}
{"text":"I had hoped it would be a little better. The reviews on here where 4 even 5 stars. I wasn't impressed. The egg drop soup looked like they made it from powder and a lot of water. Lo-mein was just okay. Differently would not order the cashew chicken again. They just put cashews on top of the box."}
{"text":"Not as good as when they first opened but it's aiight. Shrimp with lobster sauce is my jam!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of this building fool you! The food here is awesome! In a choice between renovating their building and just cooking delicious food, the owners have apparently decided to prioritize the latter. I'll admit that at first I was afraid to try it out. This establishment is located a couple of blocks down from a bank where robbers coming out of the bank were supposedly in turn robbed themselves before making their escape.  However, I was intrigued by all of the positive reviews of this place and even one of my neighbors suggested we try it. 

Being originally from the east coast, I had become accustomed to the way Chinese food is prepared over there. Until now, I had not had any Chinese food over here that was made anything like the way they make it back home. To me, it was one disappointment after another.  I was starting to wonder if I would honestly have to go back to the east coast in order to enjoy Chinese food again.

Then I found this place!

While there are understandably some variations in flavoring, the food at Canton Wong #8 is almost exactly the way they make it back home. I was shocked! I tried the sweet and sour chicken and it was excellent! The sauce was not too tangy or too sweet like at the other places here that I tried. There was actually chicken inside of the fried dough (as opposed to there being chicken-flavored fried matter). The fried rice had bits of fried egg in it, which I really enjoyed! The eggroll shells were crispy and didn't only have chopped up cabbage (or whatever it is) stuffed inside them.  The crab puffs were stupendous! As a bonus, the meal even came with lo mein.  It wasn't seasoned quite like they make it back home, but a little soy sauce did the trick.

I will definitely come back to this place!

NOTE: The lunch combo prices are about $6 per plate and the dinner combo prices are about $9 per plate."}
{"text":"Canton Wong #8 from a ex- NewYorker's perspective........

Neighborhood - commercial area, busy area.

Location - looks like an old house converted to a restaurant.  Bars on windows but area seems safe during business hours.  Order at counter.  There are a few tables for dining on-site as I did.  Most people go for take-out.


Service - family operated, good communication skills and very friendly!

Food - I ordered a dinner combo with Sweet and Sour Chicken.  It was HUGH.  Chicken, lo mein with chicken,  fried rice, egg roll and 2 crab puffs.  All for $7.99!

I will return."}
{"text":"Good food, half hour delivery. Fair 
priced. Repeating the order and delivery address is tedious. Highly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"Tried to call in order. Girl who answered the phone seemed lost and requested we be place on hold. (Hold as in place on counter and left to hear their personal conversations for over 5mins) Another women picked up seemed even more confused than the first on what we trying to do (how hard is we'd like to place a to go order). Finally gave up hung up on them and called our normal place just down the street from them. So much for trying something new."}
{"text":"Wow I just had a great sweet and sour chicken lunch! Every aspect of this meal was tasty, no complaints. Chicken was great and service was top notch! Very happy, will be back again for sure! Nice mom and pop spot. Gonna try something else next time. Excited to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has great tasting Chinese food for pretty good prices...the reason I'm giving it one star was because my sister found a dead black bug that looked like a water bug in the chicken fried rice...not so appetizing if you ask me....I won't be back here."}
{"text":"We order from this restaurant at work at least twice a week, the food is good and decently priced and they deliver which is great! I get the spicy pepper beef or the king pao two and they are amazing. Egg rolls also very good"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Ended up tossing $25 worth of food because it didn't taste right. The meat was hard and didn't taste great, the crab puffs were soggy and the egg rolls were kinda cold. Never will order from here again."}
{"text":"The building is old but the inside is clean.  the family that runs this place is very friendly.  we eat here almost every sunday.   I love the egg foo young with vegetables.   We often order broccoli beef or happy family too.   The prices are $2-3 less than others, and the location is close to home.  Portions are always enough for 2 meals."}
{"text":"Hands down best Chinese food in phx! Might be a far drive but you won't be sorry.  Portions are enough for two days and satisfy any craving for REAL Chinese food."}
{"text":"I think that Myles and Kristin already said a lot of what you need to know about this sketchy-looking but oh-so-handy-to-have-nearby Chinese place, so I'll just hammer out the highlights:

-Closed Mondays 
-Delivery area goes from 34th Street (E) to 35th Ave (W) and 1-17 (N) to Dobbins (S). Do note, though, that we live off of 19th Ave south of Dobbins (about 1 mile south of the southernmost boundary of the delivery zone) and they said that they would deliver to us without a problem, so definitely still try if you're just outside of the zone. 
-There is a $12 pre-tax minimum for delivery 
-Food is decent quality for the price and not as greasy as one would expect
-Paper menus have some decent coupons on them. Best one gives you 10 free crab puffs or 3 free egg rolls with purchase of $15 or more
-Lunch specials are ridiculously cheap (from $3.50 - $4.50 for entree and rice; $4.15 to $4.88 for entree, rice, egg roll, and crab puff) and are served until 3:30 pm

Definitely not worth driving to if you don't live in South Phoenix. However, if you do live in South Phoenix, this is a cheap and reliable Chinese dine-in, pick-up, and delivery place."}
{"text":"Love their food! Their shrimp with lobster sauce is one of the best I've had! The same delivery man comes to my door every time for nearly a decade! You get great portions for the price!"}
{"text":"They have the Best customer service. I Love ordering from this place. Great menu abd the Delivery is good too."}
{"text":"I was desperate for Chinese today and I found a spot that delivered,  so I was super amped. I have never tried this spot before, so I was a little apprehensive,  but nonetheless,  I went for it. The lady who took my order was pleasant and the food came to us very fast, but as soon as I opened the door to receive my food,  I got a whiff of a strange smell. Not the wonderful smell of good quality Chinese,   but some straight gutter,  low quality ish. I opened the bag and the smell of old grease and burnt food hit my nostrils. I order veggie fried rice,  veggie egg rolls and fried chicken wings.  And all of it smelled old af.  I made sure I said a prayer before I ate the food.  The egg rolls tasted like cinnamon fried something, so pretty much... I was eating everything that they fried the the food in,  so basically I got a  Chinese food bonus,  everything I ordered plus the free taste of old fried desert... It's my lucky day!  The Rice had the same fried,  sweet,  dirty taste.  I threw all of it away, and the  chicken was greasy af... So greasy I could use it on the creaky  door hinges in my house, enough to shine your shoes,my shoes and even  enough grease to use on my face so I can prepare for battle and give them a straight up ass whopping for serving this disgusting food. 
 I abhor this place,  and so should you."}
{"text":"I love getting take-out and delivery from this foodery. They have awesome combo plates, and their egg rolls are really unique. The cream cheese puffs could be bigger, I'd rather have fewer big ones than several tiny ones. But that's just my opinion. My top three favorite dishes, orange chicken, chicken chow mein, and beef fried rice."}
{"text":"It's always hard to try out a new Chinese place but tonight we decided to take a gamble and ordered take out. The kids and I tried out the dinner combinations (orange chicken & sweet and sour pork) that also came with fried rice, lo mein, an egg roll and crab puffs. The portion size was huge!! The food was good for the price and amount given. We all kind of wondered where the crab was in the crab puff but it was a good fried wonton with cream cheese inside. My SO ordered the orange chicken dinner which came with steamed rice. It was just about the same price but nearly as much food. He was drooling over the rest of our plates and he is the only one who does not have any leftovers. I'm sure we will order again only next time I think we will try the delivery service."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood Chinese delivery place.  Sure, you can eat there too, but I think it tastes even better when I'm curled up on my sofa.

They have a pretty good delivery area and their food is pretty darn tasty.  It's not as good as a few places that used to deliver to me in other parts of town, but considering my location, I need to be happy w/ what I have.  

The prices are awesome.  That is definitely a bonus.  Ordering dinner there once often equals at least 2 dinners at my house, and often 2 dinners and a lunch.  

The only advantage to going there, is that they have those cool drinks w/ the little tapioca balls in the drink.  I keep meaning to go by just to try one. I think they are called Boba drinks?  Hard to remember when I haven't gotten it and they aren't listed on their to go menu.  

Anyhow, it's worth trying if you're in the neighborhood.  And if you like those drinks - I know there aren't too many places in Phx that have them yet."}
