{"text":"Best goddamn wings in the city. I try to make it for wing night a couple times a month and oooooohhh lawwrrrdddd I am never disappointed. The service is hit or miss. The barkeep is a BITCH!!!!!!!! But I avoid her at all costs so I usually have a great time. But those wings...oh man... they are what dreams are made of..... 

5 STARS!"}
{"text":"I've only been to the Hose & Hound a couple of times at lunchtime. The best thing is the quick service. I'd say the food is sub-par, however, I've only tried a salad and a sandwich. A lot of people around me were ordering hot dishes, which looked tasty, but then again, I was hungry.
I quite enjoyed their house salad dressing, however the cajun chicken on my salad was dry and crunchy. A decent meal, but I've had much better."}
{"text":"I left smelling like smoke, even though no one was smoking in the establishment.  The food was decent and beers were good, but because of the smokey smell I wouldn't be coming back."}
{"text":"They say this place is haunted by a ghost monkey. The pub is inside the remains of an old fire hall in Inglewood, and legend has it that the fire chief's pet monkey still roams the floor at night causing all sorts of disturbances.
I can't say for sure if that's true because I've never had a ghost monkey interfere with my drinking there, but the barkeep seems to think something is going on.
Which doesn't seem to matter to the thrones of Inglewood residents who treat the Hose & Hound like the best pub in the area to meet up with a friend for a drink. It has an upstairs that overlooks the main floor that once housed fire trucks and you get a sense right away that the place has a history.
It offers all your favourite types of brew and on weekends hosts local live music. If you find yourself in Inglewood, stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite pub in Calgary based on my experiences there. Can only speak for the wings as far as food but they are some of, if not the best in the city (yet to try mug shotz). Very meaty and great flavours, definitely worth checking out on Wednesdays! Beer selection is good too and service has always been great. Cool crowd/ building and a great location in trendy inglewood."}
{"text":"Being a resident in Inglewood I am a firm believer in supporting the neighbourhood. Well, sometimes you just fall in love with places in your 'hood and sometimes you don't. In the Hose and Hounds case, I did.

I frequent the Hose at least once a week for everything from meatball Thursdays (.25 cents a meatball and you get to choose any wing sauce you want on them), to wings to the amazing nachos and everything in between. Never ordered anything I didn't like.

One of my favourite spots to hang out with a couple drinks after work  or in the middle of the afternoon or after a fun day of rafting. 

The staff are very personable and efficient. No complaints here, except they may on occasion poke fun at me :)

Give it a try. It's unique, has a diverse crowd and is an all-around fun Inglewood time."}
{"text":"I've been here for drinks before and enjoyed the atmosphere, so when we were wandering around Inglewood hungry I thought why not stop at this friendly neighbourhood pub.  

I'm not sure if it was an off day, but service was definitely lacking.  We sat on the patio and maybe waited 15 minutes before I decided to get up and grab the menus for our table, which finally got our server to come over and visit us.  She took our orders and brought our drinks fast enough, but we did wait quite awhile for the food even though it wasn't that busy.  Once we got our food though, we didn't really see our server after that, so we definitely couldn't get any refills on drinks. 

The food was alright, absolute pub food is what you are going to get here.  Nothing exciting, but just enough to not be terrible.  My friend and I ordered the nachos and in my opinion, they are very expensive for what you get ($15).  Plus, if you get the nachos, don't add chicken on top... $5.50 for a tiny sprinkling of small cubes of chicken - not worth it.  We definitely did not know the chicken on top would cost that much, $20 for very bland, small nachos?  Not again.

Overall, I'd only go here for drinks again.  The atmosphere is nice enough for grabbing some cool brews with pals, but dinner?  No thanks, there are better options down the street."}
{"text":"I give it 3 because of the service. 4 for alright food. Not sure why, but servers here just don't seem to remember they have tables. When you ask after waiting for 15 minutes , they get snarky and seems to not want to bother with you. Happens a lot. Especially upstairs. Otherwise, the food and booze is pretty good."}
{"text":"Always come here while working the Flames games. Staff always remembers us and our orders. Food is great, atmosphere is your typical neighborhood pub feel."}
{"text":"Had 2 vastly different experiences there. The first was a perfectly pleasant Canada Day dinner with friends on the patio. The food was pretty good and the service was also fine. The atmosphere on the patio is lively, but not too loud. It's also decently enclosed so you don't necessarily feel like you're right beside 9th Ave.

My second and more recent visit was pretty much the opposite experience. The waitress took our drink orders and basically never came back unless we tried very hard to wave her down. The first time we tried to get food, she walked away after taking down the orders of only half of our table. We were there for an hour and a half, and the waitress did not once ask if we wanted more drinks. In the end, we decided to just get the bill and leave. The bill alone took another 15-20 minutes to get. It seemed like our server was actively trying to avoid us. I'm not very picky when it comes to service, but this was the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant.

Based on my first visit, I'd give the place 4 stars. Based on the second, I'd give it 1 star. I'll probably give the place another chance; the establishment itself is fine, as is the food. Hopefully we'll get another waitress next time."}
{"text":"The Hose is the pre-game hangout for my buddy whenever the Flames are playing. Grab some food and a couple of drinks before the game, talk to the usual server and then a short walk over to the 'dome.

Food - Your usual pub fare but consistently good quality makes it a sure bet since with some pubs, you chance it every time you order. They do have a surprisingly good Chicken Mulligatawny soup and wraps.

Drinks - There are usually some sort of special on, especially on game night. I stick with the Big Rock stuff to keep things simple.

Service/Ambience - Jamie's our usual server and she rocks! The ambience is lively with televisions placed throughout the establishment complete with your pool table, jukebox, couple of arcade games and firehall decorations.

P.S. - I would love to see this ghost monkey!"}
{"text":"Had a pint or two with a buddy and shared 2lbs of the Chili Lime (my fav at this place) and then some 2 Alarm Hot Wings. The 2 Alarm could have been hotter but my bad for not ordering the 3 Alarm I guess. 

Quick and friendly service, good price and once again reaffirms it as one of my favorite wing places in town."}
{"text":"The Hose and Hound is the equivalent of Inglewood's Village pub and is located on 9th Avenue. I work in Highfield and pass it almost every day when I go downtown on business.  It's located in an old fire-hall building and has a wonderful ambience and old world charm. I go there when I can, and usually go there in large groups. Recently I had a \"teambuilding\" session there with my staff, as I figure that there is nothing better than rallying the troops in a fire-hall, when things are on fire, in one's organisation....
  
I like pubs when the grub is good and when the service is earthy and friendly. While I know that buxom waitresses are no longer pub fare, I still yearn for those colonial and imperial days, where the public house was somewhat indistinguishable from the bawdy house. But I digress. 

This pub is in a great location and offers a wide range of great pub food and beer.  I am not a beer drinker, so tend to order Ciders when I go to pubs.  I also restrict my food choices to, well you guessed it, fish and chips, steak pies and quesadillas (why else would you go to a pub???)  Although, I suspect that Geoffrey Chaucer would turn in his grave if he knew that Pubs were serving Mexican Quesadillas. The fish is nothing less than halibut, and their steak pies include Spolumbo Sausage. What can I say? Quite a culinary titillation and tease for Calgarians. 

All in all, great service, whether on your own, or in large groups. My test of good restaurant service and management, is to see whether, they can cope with large groups, before they are all stressed out and the orders all screwed up, and the food arrives cold and at the wrong tables! They appear to know how to cope with this problem, without getting flustered!   

Finally when a pub offers you wings, ribs, fries and meatballs by the pound, then you know they mean business. Someone needs to remind them however, that Canada is a metric Country, and that they should be offering these things by the KILOGRAM! 

Try this joint. You won't be disappointed with the food and beer. But don't go there to watch The National with Wendy Mesley."}
{"text":"NOT your Monday Night Football spot. We will never to back after this.

3 of us were there on Monday, Sept 27, 2010 to watch Monday Night Football on the big screens. Too bad 4 ladies got there before us and put $10 in the jukebox. The main floor was EMPTY but for the 7 men there to watch the game in silence with Elton John's Candle In the Wind, and Mariah Carey and Women in Song II blasting from the speakers. 

We asked if they could put the sound on and they, in their snotty-est, said that the women were there first. We asked again and got it from the bartender lady so we left.

I called the manager the next day and told her. She called back and said the ladies were there first. 

From the way that they handled it we will never go back. EVER and we used to go there 3 times a month. And we will tell all we know to avoid it - which we are.

And the food was crap too."}
{"text":"Thursday night is meatball night!

It was a new experience to order meatballs for 25 cents each, just like wing night. Being able to choose any wing flavour for 10 meatballs at a time was a fun twist, and my friends and I were hooked!

We tried lemon pepper, chilli & lime, teriyaki, honey garlic, apple BBQ, and salt & pepper. They were all standouts, but teriyaki was my favourite. Super filling and good for sharing with a group of people. 

We also had the poutine, which uses cheddar cheese but was layered well with a savoury, dark gravy . Pints of Wild Rose were also on special.

I've been to the Hose on wing night (Wednesdays) and it is usually pretty packed, but Meatball Night had plenty of seating, upstairs and downstairs.

It's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, usually for drinks but we stopped in here for a meal on a Friday after work.

Okay so the decor is tired and a little bit out of the 90's (or maybe 80's) but it is clean and surprisingly large inside. They also have two decent sized patios during the summer. I suspect the extra summer seating was why we didn't have a hard time finding a table inside even though it was busy.

Service was quick and efficient. They didn't offer up any specials or recommendations but we didn't ask either. I kind of got the feeling they expected us to know already. We ordered a couple of beers and some nachos to start. The nachos probably would have been enough for us to eat but we were piglets and ordered main dishes. I had the souvlaki greek salad and my partner had the steak sandwich. He was impressed by the size of the steak compared to other places. He ordered gravy for his fries and it had a funky taste so we'd both probably pass on gravy for future visits. The salad was also good - huge portion.

This is a great neighbourhood place that seems to appeal to a lot of different types of people.  Worth checking out if you are nearby!"}
{"text":"Sometime around 2002 I went to the Hose & Hound for the first time and there was a fire. A real live fire and firemen and everything showed up. My friend and I watched as the pub called the Hose & Hound filled with firemen on every floor and we looked at each other and thought, \"well this is fun entertainment!\"

Sadly, we were embarrassingly wrong, since it was a real fire. Being the last people in the pub (because we were watching the 'entertainment') we were asked by a nice fireman to exit the building while they made sure it was safe.

If the Hose & Hound had fireman entertainment where people in yellow suits ran around like it was a real fire hall and, I donno, gave away free drink coupons or something, this joint would get 5 big stars from me for 'fun quirky entertainment'. But since they don't, they get two. Not because my friend and I were stupid when we were 21; no sense in punishing a pub for not thinking up fun entertainment; but because this place is just a run-of-the-mill neighborhood pub.

There's nothing wrong with a neighborhood pub, it's usually full of regulars, they know your order, it's in YOUR neighborhood; all those are nice things. But there's also nothing especially exciting about Hose & Hound. The menu is everyday pub food, the drinks are nothing out-of-the-ordinary; but hell, if you need a cold beer with a side of potato skins and live in the area; this might just be the place for you.

T."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the staff here. Seriously, just awesome people who like their jobs and are good at what they do. All the times we've come here service is great and after coming a few times, the staff remember us and are always super friendly with us.

We come here now and again for pints or sometimes catch the Cesar specials, and it's always fun. Chill atmosphere with a mixed unpretentious crowd. This place has plenty of regulars and I can see why, it makes for the perfect local pub. There's lots of space here as well, and we've never had any problem finding a place to sit. I haven't tried the eats here but friends have and it looks like your typical pub fare.

Good for a pint stop in Inglewood and it's also a nice place for biking too as it's accessible from the river trails."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great selection of beers!! Live music as well on Friday's and Saturday's I think !!"}
{"text":"A decent little pub. I like how it looks inside defiantly unique but I found the menu to be a bit plain and \"same ol\" that goes for the beer options too. 

I ordered a taco salad and I have to say that it was very delicious, but c'mon.... lets be honest, taco salads are as safe as it gets. 

Our waitress was on it and I liked her cool approach and attitude. I'd come back."}
{"text":"How could they get everything wrong?!?
The eggs Benedict had rock hard centers, the fish & chips was a crust of batter with no fish inside (literally empty!) And the grilled cheese was cold.

I will never come again."}
{"text":"Just walked 6 blocks for a appy and drinks at 9:25 on a Monday.    They were closing and sent us away."}
{"text":"I don't drink, but I LOVE coming to this pub. The food is great for a little pub, and the whole aura is great! The inside is adorable, but I LOVE the covered patio. That part to me is fantastic. I only gave 4 stars because parking is major poop, but I suppose that comes with the area."}
{"text":"After catching a show at The Ironwood, a group of us were out taking a walk in Inglewood and we ended up at The Hose & Hound.

I love the vibe of this place. I love the fact that this pub is located in Calgary's original #3 Fire Station and I especially love the firefighting theme that runs throughout the place. With vintage equipment and photos on the wall, it's hard not to feel as though you've escaped into another realm after having step foot in here.

The staff is amazingly friendly, the food and drinks are reasonably priced and the location is prime - who doesn't love Inglewood?!??!

All we need in here now is a constant supply of Calgary's finest firefighters and then it's ON. ;)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and beer. Patio is ok in the summer time. Had the velvet fog from wild rose and enjoyed it. The fish dish I had was good as well and I would have it again."}
{"text":"The Hose and Hound was recently sold and the new owners underwent renovations. It just opened back up to the public last week and we stopped in after helping my brother move. 

Nicely done! It seems to be brighter in there but the skylight was already there, but they opened up some of the internal areas like removing the ledge above the bar - that opened up the bar. 

The H&H still has the same great service and still has their Eggs Benny for Sunday brunch. The hollandaise sauce taste like it is freshly made in house and is delicious. 

Check them out - an awesome stop in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"An average pub. Large patios in the front and side are good for groups. The food is ok, the beer is standard. Specials can be really cheap so if you're looking for a bargain try Thursday night meatballs... a decent sharesy for 50 cents!"}
{"text":"Amy served ya tonight and was absolutely fantastic!! She recommended the pork ribs and I can honestly say they are the best ribs I have ever eaten. They were fall off the bone good. We also had the bison burger which was equally delicious!

Frank has totally redone this bar and improved the food and service immensely!

Live music on the patio! Couldn't ask for a better night!!"}
{"text":"Decent, very kitsch neighborhood pub in a great section of Inglewood with lots of seating, parking and a small selection of things even a vegan can eat. But it's pub food, so expect everything from salads to cocktails to have a big fat slice of ham in it. With all the games, it reminds me of the Albatross in Berkeley :). All it's missing are the board games (which I could take or leave, since board games at a bar can get a little unsanitary)... and the following:

1) There are no yam fries on the menu. That's a paddlin'. 

2) When I said \"small vegan selection\" I meant 2 appetizers and 2 sides: the Naan bruschetta, the dumplings and spring roll combo (if you ask for no dumplings), sautéed veggies and the fries. I came here incredibly hungry once and the menu made me a sad panda, while I watched friends consume salads full of shredded ham. A veggie burger on the menu could make up for this. Even a dry hockey puck is better than no hockey puck. At least the hockey puck means you're trying.

In short, until they add the above; if you're a vegan/vegetarian, eat before you stop here so you have a nice booze sponge to soak up all the lovely Red Velvets you're going to drink here later."}
{"text":"Let's go 3.5 for this. This is nothing wrong with this place, but there is also nothing remarkable about it either. 

Cool little place, great patio, and never too busy. I had a chef's salad and strongbow and both were good. Chef's salad was different than what I picture a chef's salad, still good and one of the few options I could have."}
{"text":"I have zero complaints with the Hose 'n' Hound
But it didnt really stand out in anyway, its a bit expensive for a neighborhood pub, but thats cause its being Trendy in Inglewood I assume. Its the best pub in the area I have been to."}
{"text":"I'm downgrading it to 4 stars as the last 3-4 times I have been there the food has not been as good. 

Still this is one of my favorite pubs in south Calgary. It is one of the few pubs in our city that has history-- It is a pub inside a historic fire station. There is lots of light: skylights, big windows and a great patio. A nice change from the dark boarded windows typical Irish pub/bar feel."}
{"text":"I love this Pub.  Any excuse to take folks there is good enough for me!  This year we were there for my girlfriend's Birthday.  We  ate there before going to the Ironwood.  

The decor is great, and yes, it is haunted.  Look up the history on their webpage online sometime and you'll be amazed at the rich history of this wonderful place. One of the bathroooms is perpetually cold upstairs and there was a haunted pub tour here. 

As for the normal (as opposed to Para-normal) goings on, the wait-staff  are knowledgeable, personable and efficient.   In particular my favourite young gal who you have to go visit for yourself is one of the main reasons I  praise the service at the H & H.  Our very attractive\"Pheonx Girl \"(Our family nickname for her)  has impressed everyone she's served and she never ceases to look good,  give great advice on the newest things on the menu and she's fun to talk to as well.  

We sat upstairs last time we were there and it's a nice private place which I realized later we'd been to in it's first incarnation as  The Firehosue restaurant. 

 It's much more fun as a pub and the beer is good,  Wine's not too bad either.  

I like the apple pork burger.   I loved the nachos in summer and my friend adores that Madagascar sauce (can't get it anywhere but the H & H!) on the Mini-Wellies.  And the Bruschetta is light and nice to munch while drinking.  The Calamari is good, too.

The Patio is a cool respite form walking around in Inglewood on a hot summer day.   

And they have a Celiac Menus for those who are gluten intolerant and for the Vegans there's a ltitle this and that too!  

I'd recommend an aftnoon visit for a couple of appies because they're always so interesting or tasty you can't have just one!

This summer you'll find me sipping some good brew out on the cool patio listening for the haunted horses ... and chatting to Our Favourite Waitress!"}
{"text":"This is priced as, and has the atmosphere of a 'dive' but the quality of the food, service, and even the drinks totally exceed the expectations of the cash you throw down. We ordered 6 things between the four of us and nothing was cooked less than perfect. I had jalapeno chowder (yum!!) myself and could not be happier. Usually when one sees a hodge-podge of cuisines on a pub menu it's a little red flag that everything will just be okay, but we tried off the gluten free menu (bbq sandwich), appetizers (quesadillas and wings), soups (jalapeno chowder), salads (garden and caesar) and entrees (steak) and everything was awesome. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always get good service and have never had a bad meal. (Keep in mind it's a pub). Only thing pulling my rating down is the prices. Things are VERY expensive considering the venue and quality."}
{"text":"Love this place and come here often because of the location. Staff is great, service is awesome.

But, either the food has this get better or the prices have to go down. Everything I've ordered - burgers, salads, apps - are mediocre at best. Except wings. Wings are always good."}
{"text":"Visited to meet up with a friend, ordered a Poutine and Taco Salad. I've been here before but it was about a year ago with the same friend. I don't understand his appreciation for this pub outside of get-together. 

The food, the service, and the ambiance are \"meh\". In fact, I think you have to be a regular to like it at all. Another thing I noticed was once I'd paid my bill the waitress was gone. My meeting continued but from the server it was basically \"Ok thanks for your money & tip now get out of here\". The reality was I was hoping there was something I could think of ordering to redeem the experience but that was not happening. 

Only positive was the fact there were many places to sit and it didn't feel cramped in (on a Saturday night)- but maybe that's not surprising.

* Fair Price/Product Comparison
* Seating

(missing * for: service, food quality/wow factor, and consistency)"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS. Great food, surprisingly so. The Halibut Chowder and Halibut burger are first-class/top shelf. Friendly, courteous service. Decor a bit rough. Nice patio. Likely the best value in Inglewood. Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Attended a Stampede Party at the Hose and Hound on their outdoor covered patio area. I'm probably under-scoring the Hose and Hound a bit based on this experience as I think part of the appeal is dining inside. Why? Because the Hose in Hound is actually built in a former Firehall and is a piece of Calgary's history! Unfortunately most of the original building is gone other than the original brick façade, but there's still a bit of a historical draw to this place with a number of ghost stories that go along with it!

The outdoor patio was nothing special; it's aesthetically simple and doesn't offer anything other than having a covered section which we appreciated on the scorching hot day. They have a pretty decent selection of beers on tap which I welcomed, but the food was average at best for me. We tried various appetizers including wings, meatballs, spring rolls, pizza and veggies. The meatballs were probably the best of the bunch, but still just mediocre for me. Our server was quick and efficient, but seemed to feign a kind demeanor which was a put-off for me.

I'd consider it a decent enough place to grab a pint, but I'd probably grab a meal elsewhere. Definitely worth checking out if you're big on paranormal activity though ;-)."}
{"text":"First of one of the best covered patios in Calgary.  The only thing that could make it better is having roll down tarps for the sides for if the wind and rain pick up.  Big space with lots of tables and heaters.  Good daily specials like two for one appys and happy hour specials on drinks.   Menu is typical pub fare but there are some healthier options like salads if you are so inclined.  Portions decent.  I've never left feeling hungry.  Each time I've been service has been good.  Even if it's busy and service is slower they are consistently friendly and give it their all."}
{"text":"Given that I don't like pub food I give this place high marks. There are a number of items on the menu that I actually like which almost never happens. The souvlaki plate is flavorful. The rice has feta cheese, black olives, onions, tomatoes and oregano. The chicken skewer is always moist and the tzatziki is made with sour cream and dill which is wrong but for some reason still good. My other favorite is the halibut burger which is always moist too. The fish is pan fried and not breaded (I hate breaded fish sandwiches) and comes with homemade tartar sauce and capers. I get it with the house salad which comes with this mouth watering dressing only made by them which must contain soya sauce and ginger or something. The servers are all tough but friendly and they get to know their regulars. The building was an old firehouse and the pub pays homage to that. They have tasty daily specials and a different soup for each day of the week that is made from scratch. My favorite is beer and cheddar soup. The best part for most people will be the bar that boasts many beers on tap. There are also pool tables and dart boards upstairs as well as a jukebox with hundreds of selections. If you are looking for a pub for dinner this is the one."}
{"text":"Great pub, stopped here after a visit to the zoo when we had a day to kill after hiking in the Rockies for a week.

I grabbed a Rickard's Red and the Beef taco salad. Beer as typical for Rickard's was great and the taco salad was just what I needed as I wasn't in the mood for a big burger or something overly heavy.

If I lived locally would definitely give this place another go as it had a great atmosphere. 

Oh a 'celebrity note', while we were eating here, the hubby of Gwen Steffani, Gavin Rossdale was eating outside, and it seemed to have the wait staff all in a buzz."}
{"text":"Most awful experience! Went to settle up the bill at the end of the night and the server pinched cash that had been left on the table by some that had left earlier. When she denied that the bill had been settled up, as there had been witnesses to the contrary, she said she was never paid and if they had paid someone else she had no knowledge. I asked if we could check if someone else had settled them up and she said it was my problem to go an deal with it. The bar manager also refused to investigate the situation and let the woman serving us be rude and abusive. 

Horrible customer service and staff who steal - such a shame for a great neighborhood pub that we frequently visit. A whole lot of inappropriate behavior!"}
{"text":"They sell beer, with plenty of choices. Especially love the wild rose. Great service with a smile (Meagan) putting up and joining in with our shenanigans. Clean bathroom, all around comfortable place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Average at bestfor inner city! If you have average expectations you won't be disappointed. Needs to improve menu as one can get far better elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"I heard the Hose and Hound is haunted - I don't know that for sure but it's always on those lists in local magazines. You know, in slow months or the October issue - the spookiest places in Calgary...! Please. Not that I don't buy the haunted, because trust me, I do. I still run down the stairs after I go to the bathroom at my grandma's house because for mmm my entire life I have been convinced ghosts grab me out of the toilet. But I don't particularly enjoy formula magazines. 

Hose and Hound has been around for ages and ages - it's a staple in Inglewood. It might even be the only true public house in the neighborhood, as in true pub. I'm not sure though - I'll have to investigate further most definitely. 

I haven't been there in a few years and most certainly not sober or during the day time. So I walked in and wasn't 100% sure that I was the clientele are generally after. Mostly older gentlemen, many of the \"biker\" variety. And I was wearing my pink sun dress and little green shoesies. We got a few stares but I kept my chin up and we choose a seat by the window. 

Sat down and ordered, and I noticed the fantastic cathedral ceilings - heyzeus. And how they were sky lighted so there is this fantastic sunshine just pouring in. Tres impressive. It certainly compensates for the cigarettes burns in the bench seating upholstery. Who really cares anyway, right? I peaked through the windows, admiring the original brick and the huge patio and the mature trees. Ugh - so nice. And then a fly sat on my arm. Hmm. 

The food came out - traditional Wellington's and a 10'' pizza (which has 8 slices, am I the only person who measures a pizza NOT by the inch but by the number of slices so I know how many people can partake?) with sausage (SpolYUMbo's!) white onion, pepperoni and red pepper. The food was great - the SMOKES the horseradish is to die for. I took a little bit and LITERALLY the back of my head was on fire. Insane in my membrane - literally. The wellie's were great even without the horseradish. Yum yum in my tum tum. 

The pizza was also very good - I like it when the pizza comes out hot enough to have ewwy gewwy cheese and not hot enough to burn the roof of your mouth to a hole of blisters, which will eliminate any chance you have to enjoy your pizza (or coffee for that matter). 

So the food was fantastic, the server was really nice but why only three stars? I don't like sharing my food with flies, I think I saw someone else's from the night before on the carpet and the patio wasn't open on a sunny Sunday afternoon. ????? 

Part of me wants them to renovate and make it all nice - and then I'm like, nice? What is nice? Is that hip and trendy? Do I really want it to turn into some yuppie joint with the word \"vino\" in the name? Because that might be the beginning of the end of the soul of Inglewood and Ramsay, Calgary's last remaining artisan district. 

That's puzzle for another day, I guess."}
{"text":"I declare Thursdays Hose & Hound day.  Why?  The Hose & Hound already claimed Thursdays as Meatball Day on their specials list.  

I stopped in after a frisbee game last night with my team for some yummy grub (I can always count on the Hose & Hound).  The bottom of the menu told me that meatballs were on special.  $0.25 per meatball, and available in any of the flavours they offer for wings.  DELICIOUS.

30 meatballs later, we left satisfied.  Three cheers for Meatball Thursday.  Hip hip...."}
{"text":"Great pub.
I have yet to visit the patio yet..but the service has been great both times we've been.

Price wise the food is a little on the high-side for this style of pub, but it is delicious. The prices of the drinks, especially during happy hour specials makes up for it.

Great, fast fun service. All the gals we've met have been fantastic.
The Owner is a hoot! Super friendly and you can tell he cares about his pub being a part of the community!

I've had the Chicken and Waffles burger AMAZING! YUM. WORTH. EVERY. PENNY.
The mini Yorkies appetizer is fantastic - but hey: Watch out for that horse raddish it'll take your head off!

Second time out: I had the Perogy and Bratwurst platter.
Not too greasy, and just the right amount of food. Not too much, but not too little.
(if not a little heavy due to the sour cream and cheese) But if you're in the mood for that delicious home cooked type food - you can't go wrong!

My wife has had the mac and cheese and she still talks about it.

Definitely worth many visits to sample their entire menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I went down to Inglewood to try Eat! Eat!, but we got there after it had closed.  We wandered down the street a bit and came across the Hose and Hound.  I had been there before, but only for beers.  We decided to try it out.

At 3 pm on a Tuesday, this place wasn't busy.  It was great to sit out on the patio (they have a long, skinny patio by the entrance that is in the sun, and a bigger patio under cover on the east side of the building) and enjoy our meal.

I ordered the Reuben sandwich and she ordered the clubhouse.  Our waitress, Megan, was efficient and nice.  She checked up on us every now and then, but not so frequently that it got annoying.

Her clubhouse was good, although the meat was nothing special (it was deli sliced turkey, not meat pulled off the bird).  It didn't have the middle piece of bread, which was good because it made it manageable to eat.  Her salad was cold and the house dressing was good.

My reuben was delicious!  It was packed with pastrami and sauerkraut, and the mustard they gave on the side went very well with it.  The fries were okay, but a bit overcooked.  The gravy was excellent -- dark, thick, and packed with flavour.  I'm fairly certain the ketchup wasn't Heinz, which is disappointing because it's a fairly inexpensive thing to cheap out on.  It was runny and lacked a lot of taste.

The group behind us was drinking some beers and they looked good and cold!  Definitely a good option on a hot summer day.

The Hose and Hound is a staple in Inglewood, and somewhere that would be great before or after a game at the (nearby) Saddledome.  I'll be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. 

The waitress barely spoke to us and when she did she was cold and abrupt. She hastily asked if we wanted drinks without providing any menus. It took at least 15 minutes between every single interaction (sitting down, getting menus, getting drinks, getting food, paying bill). Every interaction ended with her storming off without acknowledging our presence. When the credit card machine gave us instructions in French she got mad at us and grabbed it out of our hands, telling us we were doing everything wrong. Then she asked us how much of a tip we wanted to leave her. You ever have service so bad it becomes comical? This was it. 

Food was ok but WAY overpriced for the portion size. Service alone made me not want to return."}
{"text":"This is a great neighbourhood pub, with that actual 'pub feel'. I've been told it really was a fire station back in the day, but they converted it well. For those of you who'd like to visit the shops in Inglewood, you'll find many of them were once houses or other such buildings turned businesses.
This place is great for a lazy Saturday afternoon out on the patio, or an evening out with your work buddies for a beer :)"}
{"text":"A birthday breakfast at Kane's thwarted by them closing early brought my gentleman friend and I to the Hose and Hound. 

I was at least counting on nachos or a salad as (perhaps I've not mentioned this) I don't eat gluten or most meat, which makes bar food, or really any restaurants difficult when not pre-planned.

The menu has a great selection of foods and is a great choice for people who have diverse eating needs. Gluten free pizza, several salads and rice dishes plus lots of delicious looking pub food treats.

I had the Mediterranean salad (sans sausage). Real talk: was this the best salad I've ever had? No. But it was fulfilling, cheap and just what I wanted.

Tip, don't get coffee. Not worth the money and gravity is right across the way."}
{"text":"I love this place for the atmosphere and historical importance.. but my last experience there was atrocious. Our waitress was a complete bitch (and I don't throw that term around lightly). Every time she came to the table she stormed off. My soup came out cold and it took about 10 minutes to come back. I'm pretty sure they nuked it for those whole 10 minutes because it was ungodly hot. When we paid, our credit card was making the machine act weird and she lost her patience and had even more of an attitude. I really hope she was having a bad day, but if she was ever my server again I would leave."}
{"text":"Not all pubs are created equal... and it's nice to find another unique one as this. And by unique I mean the cool building and haunted back story... Just ask anyone who works there about the Monkey and Orbs. 

The pub food is what you would expect from a pub but I like the Hose & Hound for these reasons:

(1) Great friendly fun servers
(2) Quick kitchen to table service
(3) Cool historical building
(4) Great location in Inglewood"}
{"text":"This place just renovated and went under new management. I'm here during Stampede and what a great escape from the craziness of downtown. 

Yet! Still fun for love of live music that is low enough to talk and close enough to watch the hustle and bustle. 

Frank, the owner is an amazing guy and Amy, the server not only recommended great food, but was friendly as hell. 

I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area that is looking for amazing food and a great time!

I'd highly recommend the ribs!!"}
{"text":"Finally, I can check off visiting the Hose and Hound after many an Inglewood trek. The high points for me were sitting on the second level, seeing the cigarette machine (A pack for $16) that only takes loonies or toonies, and scoring a $2 off coupon for toilet paper in the bathroom off of the new ad display.

It was rainy, so we couldn't explore the patio. The food was average, the beer was cold and they have Buck Hunter.

Inglewood's pub scene is definitely hurting, but check out the Hose and Hound for a drink."}
{"text":"Prices are biting, menu is rather common, and while the place is large inside - actual spaces are crumpled, with servers squeezing between the crowd...

It is not a bad place, but rather overboard playing a \"neighbourhood bar in a poshy area. And as much as \"poshy\" refers to \"false classy\", Hose and Hound is just there in that group, with everything - design included.

I would not hesitate to get there with a few friends though - the place is not genuinely bad, just average. Acceptably so."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet, I've been so many times!    The wings are delicious - have to try the Franky butters - which are a hot sauce with melted parmesean cheese on top.  They are to die for!   This place is a standard pub with all the regular offerings (nachos, wings, burgers etc.)   I wish they had a better beer selection though, as their offerings are quite limited."}
