{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at The County General this Sunday, after reading a lot of the write ups about this place in Toronto publications, I was excited to eat here.

I arrived with my girlfriend at around 730pm and was told there would be a 15 minute wait for a table. I happily obliged to dine at the bar. The decor and ambiance of the bar is warm and welcoming. I especially liked the liberal use of wood throughout the place.

The menu is small. I ordered some kimchi and a wedge salad to start. The kimchi was nice and spicy and the wedge salad was well prepared. 

I also had the County Drive In--a maker's mark/cream soda concoction that was refreshing.

We ordered the White Bean Meat Ball and Chicken Thigh Sandwich as entrees. The Chicken thigh sandwich was out of this world. The buttermilk battered crust was so crispy and had a real unique friend taste to it. The avocado cutney was also very fresh and limey--just the way I like it. The bun was also fantastic. Overall, its a very well-crafted sandwich and all the flavors were balanced. The same goes for the White Bean Meatball--served open face on a piece of crusty bread. My girlfriend couldn't believe something so delicious could be made without meat.

Overall, this is a nice addition to the neighborhood and I wish them great success. I hope that they switch up the menu more often because I definitely like to see what else they can put out."}
{"text":"Ok service, lousy sound system , crappy music, over cooked eggs. Good Ceasar, if a bit pricey. No need to ever go back."}
{"text":"Been living down the street from here for over a year now and finally checked it out with the husband on Sunday. 

Overall it was a very good experience, we made a reservation for 7pm but it was probably unnecessary, some good traffic coming in off the street but it wasn't busy. Perhaps around 8 or 9 this would be a different story. 

We started with drinks, I ordered a Steamwhistle but they were unfortunately out, fine I'll have a Mill St. My husband had Tommy's Margarita. The drink list is quite extensive I'm just not big on fancy cocktails, I'm all about the food! His margarita was deliciously tart and had a definite bite of tequila which was nice - but unfortunately no salt rim, so we probably wouldn't get it again. 

For food I ordered a deviled egg - they were out of these too, now I was officially disappointed. Husband had  couple of oysters to start and I went right for my main, the famous fried chicken thigh sandwich. It was very very good. I am not a huge avocado fan but it was very citrusy and added a really nice balance to the delectable fried chicken. The breading was crisp and the bun was perfectly soft. Fries on the side were good too mostly due to the homemade ketchup - a tangy/spiced version of the classic.

Husband had the Yorkshire BBQ Pork. This was a surprising dish, really well composed and perfectly executed. The pork was essentially a barbecued loin with a nice crust on the outside and slathered in kansas city bbq sauce. It was beautifully cooked and paired so well with the sweetish sauce and meaty, rich collared greens. I could have eaten a loaf of the cornbread that had real kernels of corn inside for a nice textural contrast. 

We passed on dessert this time but we will be back. Hopefully they'll have a deviled egg for me!"}
{"text":"There is no better way to celebrate running a half-marathon than gorging on fried chicken. And that is exactly what we did!

We got to the County General around 7pm on a gorgeous Sunday evening. We were quickly seated on the patio and ordered several cocktails. We asked for the fried chicken for 2 and the waitress promptly laid down a huge sheet of paper. Shortly afterwards, a lovely gentleman came and dumped several pounds of fried chicken on said sheet of paper. We happily dove in with our hands and fingers (there really is no need for cutlery with this meal) and it was heaven! I loved the chicken in hoisin sauce but unfortunately the chicken in the korean sauce was too spicy for me."}
{"text":"Service was EXCELLENT. I got in just before the dinner rush and was seated immediately. Servers came by to refill my water reguarly.

I had the falafel burger with the salad - both were really good. I love the dressing on the salad, and the burger was yummy though a bit crumbly if that bothers you. I also had the cinnamon limeade which was REALLY lime-y (not my taste)  but unique.

Prices are decent too!"}
{"text":"What a phenomenal place! After living in NYC for the last 2 years (born and raised in the burbs of Toronto), I'd really been craving some good small shop eats. And WOW, this place hit it out of the park on all accounts.

2 friends and I went to this establishment on a Friday night with a reservation (a must for this small restaurant!), and were seated almost immediately on arrival.

Two of us were drinking and started off with the Travelling man and Turkey shoot.
For food, everything was shared.

Appetizers:
Dark wing duck (duck wings in hoisin sauce) - great
Steamed buns with pork sliders - great
Cauliflower poutine - absolutely amazing!

Mains:
Chicken platter for two - stellar! 
Kielbasa with cabbage - acceptable

Desert:
Two more cocktails, St. Elizabeth and Leavin' Eden. 
Followed with The King (banana bread, bacon, toffee, peanut butter) for desert.

Overall, the food was on point, the drinks were tasty, and our server was wonderful.
Total was $170 + tip.


TL;DR:
1) Make a reservation
2) Share the food because there's such good stuff there!
3) Grab some well thought out cocktails
4) Be weary that there's only one server for the entire establishment, so be patient.
5) Enjoy the awesome food."}
{"text":"Went tonight with my partner and looking over the cocktail list i thought WOW 15 dollars for a 2 oz drink better be good.  i received my drink it was good but not 15 good..... move on to the pork belly which was bland bland bland actually tasted like cold day old chicken.  I ordered a burger and my partner had a fried chicken thigh sandwich and boy oh boy was it tasteless and dry, it takes a lot to make a chicken thigh dry, so i guess thats a plus for the kitchen.  My burger was worst patty i have ever experienced, mayo and pickle lol are you serious for 12 dollars and its 4 oz give me break.  It is unfortunate that such a place should open in this neighborhood and have such horrible food.  I gave them one star because the fries were great and if anyone from the county is reading this , please take not that when a customer eats half the meal and says\"this was really dry and bland\" you should comp the item."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. One of my personal faves for dinner and brunch. The atmosphere is perfect. The staff and service is always friendly and personal but the best part is that the food is to die for. This place knows meat and uses a head to tail type approach but whats great is that their vegetarian dishes are also amazing. 

If you want flavour and a good time night or day this is the place to go. It a small spot so groups of 4 or more are tricky but its worth the wait.

Oh and I didn't even get to the fact that they single handedly brought back the picnic to Trinity Bellwoods with their $10 picnic baskets. Genius!

PS. Try their Scotch Bonnet hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Five of us showed up for brunch on the Monday of the long weekend.  We were the second table through the door.  We were disappointed that they didn't' have their signature dish available for us, the chicken thigh sandwich.  Anyways we order, but something got messed up and every single table had received their food and had finished before us.  My wife asked the waitress for bread and the girl told my wife that they don't do that here and walked away.  The manager knew we were upset as it had been an hour since we ordered and brought our food out within five minutes.  I think they had forgotten about our food.  No one came to check on us in that hour and the waitress told us she couldn't give my wife a piece of bread.  I know they were really busy, but i get really upset when they act like we don't deserve to be there.  I ate the pigs head and it did not agree with me or my bum,"}
{"text":"If the idea here is to have unrealistically high prices with a high mark up to limit customers, then congrats. 

- Burger was decent but appetizer sized.
- Fries were standard issue for any restaurant. 
- One of the meals we got was uncooked chicken. Not just a little underdone, raw in spots."}
{"text":"The menu though somewhat on the meaty heavy side is actually very tasty. I had a burger which was so delicious it was possibly one of the best burgers I have had in a while. Although somewhat pricey for a casual joint it's an excellent place to hang out and have drinks. 
Oh try not to trip over all the hipsters there !"}
{"text":"The fried chicken thigh sandwich was juicy and tasty. However, the portion was definitely small and it was a bit overpriced. The flavours were definitely there, but I'm afraid anyone with a hearty appetite will not be satisfied. I'd definitely recommend this meal for lunch and for anyone who may not mind spending a little extra cash for a small portion."}
{"text":"The Splendido guys get a chance to show their relaxed and casual side at their new bar, The County General, on Queen West. My early visit in their first week shows their strong restaurant chops in full-effect. It's a relaxed spot, with high-quality food and a great cocktail/drink list. 

Tomato Sandwich
This was really excellent. Light and summery, with fantastic heirloom tomatoes. It's simple, but a really great mix of flavours. Comes sided with a little pot of spiced fries and a house-made ketchup with strong notes of chipotle.

Chicken Sandwich
Liked the cilantro in here. Went well with the crunchy onions. The sandwich was about the size of your fist. The bread looked house-baked given the custom sizing. Sided with a little pot of fries.

Pork Belly Sandwiches
Chef Victor Barry's favourite, as he'd told us when he was doing the rounds of the tables. Three flavours: kimchi, apple slaw, and avocado chutney. I only had the apple. Nice flavours; about what you'd expect. The hot sauce is kicky and will surprise you.

White Bean, Ham & Mustard Soup
I really enjoyed this simple and hearty soup. It's got a rich body with lovely flavours all stewed together. I would get this again.

Apple Pie
The crust was really nice; thin and it shattered when I attacked it with my fork. However, the filling was too sweet for me (I prefer a more tart apple pie).

Maple Walnut Ice Cream
Nice. Good chunks of walnut. Wanted a ribbon of maple taffy in it, but when do I want _less_ maple taffy?

It's a bar, so the music and noise levels were high. Conversation is still very possible though. Food portions for one are on the smaller side, so keep that in mind. I am looking forward to going back and trying the larger for-two dishes! I'm also wanted to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Great place. The thigh chicken sandwich was great and the staff were kind. Music is amazing and cool little patio. 

I wouldn't mind seeing the portions slightly bigger"}
{"text":"I visited the County General during the Ice Storm and found myself not wanting to leave.  Before I get to the food, I just want to say this is one of the most cozy and comfortable bars I have been to.  My friend and I opted to sit at the bar (great choice, got to interact with the incredible bartender and experiment with various great cocktails). The music was an incredible mix of rock from the 80's and 90's and made me feel quite nostalgic I must say. 

Food: 
When we visited, it was during their weekend brunch. I opted for the Burger with a fried egg on top and the fries.  I must say, the burger was cooked perfectly and was incredibly tasty.  The fries, with a homemade ketchup, were very fresh and crispy.  

My friend opted for the more traditional Eggs Benedict and he was blown away.

Overall, our first meal there was fantastic and I am very much looking forward to trying more menu items. 

Cocktails:
The cocktails are just incredible.  After eating, we just sat and enjoyed the music and multiple cocktails.  There are many bourbon-based cocktails as well as a few other spirits.  There is definitely something on the list that will appeal to most everybody.  As well, the bartender was incredibly engaging and created a couple of non-menu cocktails based on our tastes.  

Although I have only visited once to date, I must give The County General 5 stars as the food was great, the cocktail was great and I was truly sad to leave to head back home."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious. Great atmosphere. Place to go for brunch.

Can never say no to fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Walking through the door, I was surprised to see how small the County General is. The restaurant is quite narrow, containing about six two-tops and a long bar with seating. Luckily, my boyfriend and I were able to grab a seat within 5 minutes at around 12:30 on a Saturday (got there just in time as there were a few two-tops freeing up).  

Since it was a Saturday, we were served the brunch menu (weekends from 11am to 4pm). I started going through the drinks menu first and was disappointed to see that they didn't have any fresh juice - one of my brunch musts! However, when I saw the homemade Rosemary Lemonade ($3) on the menu, I knew I had to order it. I'm a sucker for fresh lemonade. This was definitely one of the sourest lemonades I've had, but I still really enjoyed it. I couldn't really taste the rosemary in it though, not that I'm complaining

One of the things we ordered was the Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich - buttermilk chicken, milk bun, avocado chutney, coriander and green onion ($14). The first thing I thought when it was presented to us was the size of the bun. Although the size of the chicken was decent, the bun was slider-sized - a poor chicken to bun ratio. Overall, a great sandwich. I just found myself wanting more bun.

The other main we ordered was the Corned Beef Hash - pork belly, ham, brisket, crisp potato, scallion, fresh herbs ($16). I couldn't really differentiate between the pork belly, ham and brisket, but this was a pretty tasty hash. 

Since the portions in general weren't very big, we decided to go with a dessert, the Salted Caramel Cupcake ($3). By this point, I wasn't surprised by the small cupcake that arrived at our table. I liked the salted caramel filling but I wasn't a huge fan of the cupcake itself as I found it to be a big dry and crumbly."}
{"text":"Dear County General....new ownership has not been a blessing for you.  I have been to the County General on many occasions and have always ordered the same thing, KFC for 2.  It is tasty and generous in terms of portion size as always, but it is just not as delicious as it used to be.  Along with that, which is the one thing that made me write this review, is that the service has taken a nose dive.  We were not greeted upon entry, because the bartender was talking up some girl and the server was sweeping, so after two minutes I peeped up to say that we needed a table, a table that we had reserved by the way, in the very empty restaurant.  Service did not improve, waits were long, and we did not feel that the 17% tip we gave was earned, but more expected.  Overall still tasty, but service sucks.  I want more for $113 for two!!  Please try harder.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, I keep getting their burger with fries. It's heavenly! Prefect seasoning on the burger, and their homemade ketchup is freakishly good, I bought a jar of it for home. I liked it more without cheese, as whatever cheese they use is a bit strong for me. They gave me a sample of their soup once too, omg one of the best soups I've ever tasted. Atmosphere is cool, relaxed, staff is super friendly. Love it here."}
{"text":"The 6oz burger is as excellent as everyone says, especially with cheese and bacon thrown in the mix. The fries are spicy, making them disappear quickly off your plate whether by your own hand or that of your dinner mates.

The cocktails are tasty but overpriced for their quality, which is why I'm knocking this place down to 4 stars. Otherwise the ambiance is excellent, the bar is attractive, and it makes a great place for deep conversations."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I ate at the County General today. Although the staff were extremely nice and welcoming they walked a freshly killed pig through the front door into the restaurant and to the kitchen. Head, legs, belly sliced open and bleeding. Officially a vegetarian to this place. Spent the whole night puking.. thanks for that."}
{"text":"Big yawn for over priced boring brunch and lunch!  Because of their awesome experience as restauranteurs I think they will eventually fix this place.  If not for the pedigree, I would give them max a year.  The sheep will move on to the next wannabe spot and TCG better have a plan then."}
{"text":"The food was boring and I found the whole experience rather trite--I mean, this 'fresh from the farm!' stuff just puts me to sleep.  Toronto really bums me out sometimes.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll put my mink on and eat caviar alone in my room."}
{"text":"Pork chilli was amazing and so were the drinks. The place itself is casual and has a cool vibe. Service was great. They were blasting punk rock so we couldn't hear anything across the table but aside from that everything was great."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant and decided to try it out for lunch. I got the fried chicken thigh sandwich which was so cute and small. I really liked the avocado chutney they had on the bun and the piece of chicken was huge for the bun so I had to cut off a bit to make it easier to eat! It was the perfect portion of food for me which meant that I could not finish the fries. 
I was surprised how empty it was for lunch on a Friday but it started to pick up near the end of our meal. I would love to come back for brunch.. mhmm.."}
{"text":"Another overrated hipster hangout amongst many that have sprung up around the area. The food portions were small, bland, and the prices outrageous. The service was extremely slow and pretentious. I went there for breakfast. The egg(s?) was/were blah and fries were minimal. The only thing worth noting was the theme. On the surface it looked great, with the folksy and trendy rural decor, but not worth it."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant on Queen West. Everything about it is spectacular. The fried chicken sandwich is to die for - just a little avocado can do the trick in making a truly great sandwich. Drinks are delicious. Service impeccable. Always a place to see and be seen since there are such big windows. Sit at the bar or a table, both are nice."}
{"text":"I went here for Sunday brunch with friends and we were greatly disappointed.

We were waiting outside with a bunch of other people until well after 11am when they supposedly open. Inside we could see the staff having coffee.

I ordered the burger, which I got with the side salad. I asked for the burger medium-well and it came charred and hard as a rock and tasteless. My friend asked for the burger medium and it ended up the same as mine.

My salad had hair in it and I mentioned it to the waitress who just smiled at me and took my plate away.

Portions are kinda small to begin with (as one of my friends said, \"I paid $14 for a single slider?!\") and then I didn't eat my salad so I had to eat lunch by 1pm. 

I guess I should have made more of a fuss but I was too tired and just couldn't bother. 

There were so many things that were disappointing. I don't think I would ever go back. Brunch for two with tax and tip was $50."}
{"text":"Popped in on Sunday in the late afternoon for a quick bite before we headed to a dinner party. 

Wait...that sounds weird. Lemme explain. Had been out all day, had only eaten a Clif bar for breakfast, needed something in my stomach.

Got there at about 4:45pm, they were just about to switch to the dinner menu (at 5pm). We were shown to a great time, right in the window. The space is beautiful, tables and chairs are made out of thick unfinished wood, and the bar is more of an installation than bar. It's a gorgeous space. The restaurant was full by 5:10pm, patrons seemed to be mostly connected with the restaurant (owner was at the table next to us with his family, chef and co-owner of Splendido was two tables down, someone from Toronto Stanard was taking pictures of the space).

Ordered drinks, I had Muskoka's dark ale ($7 for a pint). Decided to share a small plate ordered the Smoked Pork Belly Sliders ($10) and two orders of deviled eggs ($1.50 each order, essentially one full egg per order). 

The Smoked Pork Belly sliders came on steamed buns, very similar to the outside of a steamed Chinese pork bun. Three sliders in total, each came dressed with different condiments. #1 was topped with kim chi (very David Chang Momofuko of them), #2 was topped with an apple slaw, #3 with an avacado chutney (and cilantro). All three were delicious, I enjoyed the kim chi one the best. The pork was cooked perfectly, super moist, fatty and smoky. Deviled eggs were very good as well.

Service was friendly and professional. Would love to go back for a full meal!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken thigh burger at County General is definitely worth the hike out to Queen St. West, come early to avoid the first seating crowd if you don't want to be disappointed during brunch hours. The burger's buns are lovingly slathered with butter and has a nice charred flavour, the avocado filling is rich and the bright green colour makes the burger very inviting. The piece de resistance is the meat - from the best part of the chicken, the thighs are soaked in a beautiful brine for a delicious bite and deep fried to perfection - crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside."}
{"text":"Had a burger & fries. Was quite tasty, but the portions were very minuscule --especially considering the price. Not the greatest value; however, the environment was nice."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. The service has always been great. If you get there when there's a line, you can leave your phone number on their list and there are plenty of fun shops to browse around the area. 

I don't think I'm ordering the right dishes... I had the croque madame a while back. The serving size was generous. The peameal seemed a bit bland, but that might have been because of the fries (which were tasty but on the saltier side). It looks like they have since taken this dish off their menu. 

I had the okonomiyaki more recently. I didn't love it, but I was expecting something very different. Okonomiyaki is typically made with a flour-based batter, but I think their cabbage was held together with melted cheese? The smoked pork was delicious and the cabbage was very flavourful, but by the end, I felt like all I had eaten was a ton of gooey cheese. Maybe if the description was \"flourless okonomiyaki\" or \"deconstructed okonomiyaki\" or \"cheesy grilled cabbage\", I would have enjoyed this dish more.

If I go here again, I'll probably try one of their signature dishes, like the chicken thigh sandwich."}
{"text":"The room is quite small and narrow, with room for perhaps 20-30.  We sat at the bar, which I liked since we were far away from the hustle and bustle near the entrance door.

Drinks selection is very focused.  There are a handful of Muskoka beers on tap including seasonal varieties.  All wines are from the Niagara region.  The menu is similar in its simplicity.  Sometimes, less is more and I think theCG executes this well.

From my vantage point at the bar, I must say that everything that came out of the kitchen looked good!  I had the fried chicken thigh sandwhich and my partner had the steak frites (a hanger steak from Cumbrae Farms).  This is southern comfort food at its best!  The County burger and pork tacos looked like items I would want to order next time.  Portions are not big, but plentiful enough. 

Service was very professional.  It was a busy Friday and the staff seem so busy that there is very little time for chatter.

The County General is a great place to stop in if you want to treat yourself to a gourmet but casual meal after a stressful ride on the Queen street car, without breaking the bank.  Meal for 2 with no starters, 1 drink each, was about $65. 

Would definitely come back for the burger/tacos again."}
{"text":"My husband and I are big foodie and we don't normally write review in general. However, our experience two nights ago at County General was so unbelievably bad that I just need to write a review.

I heard great things about this place so hubby and I decided to try it out. Food was not bad... Not great but it passed for that type of restaurant.  However, the service was terrible.  Since the moment we sat down the waitress was quite not pleasant, very snotty.  Dinner experience was okay overall.  When we asked for the bill and they were having technical difficulty with the credit card machine. We initially was okay with waiting for them to fix it, however after 1/2 hr... We got really annoyed not because they were taking forever to fix it but the service we got during that time was unbelievable. Nobody came to check up on us or to let us know how much longer we will have to wait or ask us if we needed a drink or refill our water... We sat there completely invisible to them. 

I would not recommend this place to anyone for sure.  Service is big thing to me....and this place just does not do it for us."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2.5 stars. Yes, it's got that I'm too cool to eat anywhere but the trendy faux causal rustic, non fancy, but interior budget of half a million dollars to make everything appear as if they don't give a shit. 
I am not hear to pretend I'm above all that. (I'm a hipster douchebag myself)
But the too cool for service attitude is what bugged me here, along with  many other places that are similar in this city. I'm talking not even eye contact between me and the server and an attitude as if I should be so privileged to be eating here service the whole time.

Me and a friend had brunch there today. My friend arrived before me. The tone was set when I walked in and the same server walk right to to the table next to my friends table (she was sitting at the table right by the window) to bring their food, blocking me for getting to my friend, then walking way. Looking at me both twice without saying a word. Thanks for the warm welcome. 

The food was good. Nothing overwhelming or outstanding, but good quality and well made.
Maybe I had a really horrible waitress, but it really turned me off from going back here. Service is a big part of the dinning experience, so unless the food is beyond this world, service this bad can never get m back."}
{"text":"I came with a friend who has is a celiac and they were extremely accommodating about her gluten issues. I always look favourably upon a restaurant that's sensitive to people's needs. I had the calamari tacos and when I asked them to grill the calamari instead of deep frying, it wasn't a problem. The tacos were delicious and my friend thoroughly enjoyed her steak frites. My only issue is that the music was *way* too loud. The songs were good, but it was hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Come all the time. A fantastic friendly atmosphere. Great food, especially the chicken. Knowledgeable when it comes to great bourbon. Riverside highlights."}
{"text":"I came to this teeny tiny restaurant with a small group after a guy in a store recommended it highly to a friend and I as some of the best fried chicken in the city. Right off the bat when we arrived our reservation was lost or the person who took it never actually wrote it down. It wasn't busy so we were seated right away anyways and the service was fantastic the whole time. We ordered a chicken dinner and some small plates to share. The chicken dinner seemed kinda pricey at almost $50 but since we were told it was a whole chicken and seemed to come with fixings we decided it wasn't such a bad value. The chicken came in chopped up chunks that certainly didn't look like it amounted to a whole chicken and what looked like fixings on the menu is really just a bunch of toppings the server sprinkles and squirts on top of the chicken at the table. The chicken was amazing, cooked perfectly with lots of flavour but we all agreed it was definitely not worth the price for the amount you get. Would be worth it if it included a vegetable or even some fries. We also ordered the artichoke Mac and cheese which was good and the chicken and waffles. The waffles says it comes with chicken parfait but what they really mean is pate. This was really good and worth ordering. Chicken liver pate with cherry compote on a fresh warm waffle. A good place for snacks but I wouldn't order the chicken dinner again, too much of a rip off."}
{"text":"In the old Oddfellow space on the corner of Queen and Shaw is the rustic newly opened County General.  The brains and proprietaries of Splendido are behind this and were inspired by one of my favourite gastro pubs in NYC - the Spotted Pig; this woodsy jewel, in the Queen West neighbourhood which has already become a hot spot.

We went for brunch and were lucky enough to get the cozy money seat right at the window where we weren't sitting elbow to elbow with our neighbours and able to have a conversation without having someone ease drop and interrupt.  The menu is simple with casual and comforting fare. 
The coffee was an espresso based coffee and was a great way to kick start your day.
We order the classic egg benedict were were standard, nothing too crazy nor memorable, just a nice brunch dish.  
We also decide after the recommendation of our server to select the decadent corn beef hash which comes with a small squirt size bottle of house made hot sauce.  There are flavours and textures in the hash that make it unique and interesting and it was a heavy but good choice.  

The dishes are served with a side of frites served in a lowball glass, triple cooked to make it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, sprinkled with spice alongside house made smokey sweet ketchup. 

I am dying to come back for their coveted the fried-chicken sandwich which just sounds amazing and is reinforced by foursquare as the most popular tip.
County General"}
{"text":"Today was our second time going to The County General and the first time I've actually had the opportunity to write a review.  Unlike the reviewers below, it seems as though I came on an off night.  The service was tepid and the food was mediocre.

For starters, we got the roasted bone marrow, which was served with two pieces of bread and grated cheese.  Dunking bits of the bread inside the marrow and sprinkling some of the cheese on top was quite delicious.  Overall, It tasted fine - if a bit greasy - and was probably the best part of our meal.  

Next, we had the Chicken sandwich, which my friend had with the fried egg, and the burger, which I ordered with cheese.  When I took a bite of the chicken sandwich, all I tasted was a mouthful of salt.  I almost spat out the bite I had because the saltiness was too overwhelming.  For me, then, it was a thumbs down.  According to my friend, though, you needed to bite into the sandwich with the avocado chutney and the cilantro to counter the chicken's saltiness; he claimed that it was \"almost a bit\" too salty for him but that otherwise, it was fine.  This, of course, isn't exactly the most ringing endorsement.

The burger itself was...okay.  To be honest, I feel like the char that formed the outside of the patty obscured the taste of the beef.  For the first few bites, *all* I could taste was the char.  When doused with their homemade ketchup, the burger tasted better.  The cheese also added more flavour.  It wasn't the worst burger I've ever had but it certainly was far from being the best.  At $16 ($14 + $2 extra for the cheese), this burger was a tad overpriced.  I almost wish I'd ordered the steak frites, which the people next to me had; at $4 more, the servings were more sizeable and the steak actually looked quite good.

What left a bad impression for me, though, was the poor service.  The woman who was working tonight was quite nice and friendly and consistently checked on her customers.  The man, though, embodied the worst of Queen West hipsterism.  He didn't really check our table and didn't refill our water jug even after we asked him twice.  He forgot the order of steamed pork buns that the couple next to us asked for; when they couple called him on it, he shrugged and issued a half-hearted apology.  When a couple that came in inquired how long they needed to wait for a table, he wasn't entirely responsive; when the couple asked him whether a table would be ready in 30 minutes, he said drolly, \"something like that,\" shrugged, and walked away.  

Again, maybe it was an off-night, but the combination of the poor service, the mediocre food, and the fact that the servings were a tad bit too small makes me disinclined to return."}
{"text":"I always drove by this place but never went in to try it until last weekend.  My friend suggested to come here for a Sunday brunch to celebrate her birthday.  

We arrived at the restaurant by 11:30 am and the place was already full and we had to put our name on the waiting list.  We were told it would be about a 45 minute wait.  Mind you, we were a party of 4 and there were only two tables that could seat us so it explained the wait time.  

I ordered the eggs Benedict ($14) and it was a popular item on their menu.  I thought they made this very well and the eggs were cooked to perfection.  I also ordered a grapefruit juice ($4) and although it was freshly squeezed or appeared to be, there wasn't much in the glass.  

Food was decent and wouldn't say it was more expensive than other brunch places.  They have an extensive alcohol menu at your disposal especially mixed cocktails and premium drinks.  This would be the place to be if you love a bit of alcohol with your Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night at 6:30, based on what I heard I was expecting to wait, but since it was the holidays this week, I think it was slower than usual.  There were some tables available, but I opted to sit at the bar as I was only meeting one friend there for dinner and I don't mind sitting at the bar....ordered a drink while I waited for my friend (a Ruby Tuesday - was quite good!).

When my friend arrived, we both ordered the Smoked Pork Belly & Steamed buns and an order of fries to share...it was enough for the two of us.  The food came pretty quickly and everything was great.  Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff.

I went in for lunch with a friend and we were ignored for the first 5 minutes. A male server finally came over to wipe and set the table. We said hello and thank you to the server who didn't acknowledge us in any way. He finally returned with a bottle of water which he aggressively topped up our glasses, and slammed the bottle on the table, again not saying a word. We felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome in this restaurant so we decided to leave to find a more inviting atmosphere. As we were on our way out the server finally decided to open his mouth for the first time to sarcastically say \"Thanks, see you later guys!\"
I'm not sure what we did to offend this server, but I can say I will NOT be trying this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Tried this out on Friday night on a whim, and were lucky to get seats, because the place was PACKED. We ended up sitting at the bar, and even this was after a 20-minute wait. But the staff were great - took our name & cell phone number when we first arrived, and said they'd call us in 20 minutes to update us. And true to their word, they called us exactly 20 minutes later. They suggested a spot would arise at the bar shortly, and welcomed us to come back and wait inside. My husband had a drink while we waited. We saw much of this throughout our meal - people sitting on the windowsill having a drink while waiting for a table to come up.

The food was great, but as all the other reviewers mention, small portions. We treated it more like tapas, and ordered 2 mains and 3 starters between the two of us. I had the burger, my husband had the pork sliders. Both were delicious. We also had the coleslaw, Kim chi, and an order of fries. My husband, happy to be out on a Friday night, tried a few different beers, which are all local - Muskoka, Steamwhistle, and Mill Street. I opted for the non-alcoholic Rosemary Lemonade, which was nice and refreshing!

The vibe was cool, the music was upbeat, and the crowd was happy. We will likely return, but not expecting to be filled up!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Toronto! I crave this restaurant almost every week, and if it weren't for my expanding waistline, I would definitely indulge more than I do.  The drinks are unique and refreshing (although a bit pricey) - the Blueberry Bourbon Fashion and Strawberry Serrano Margarita are my go-to orders.  

It is an absolute MUST to order the \"KFC\" Chicken for Two. Don't be afraid to dig in with your hands! BBQ sauce (sweet and spicy) is poured over the chicken and avocado cream is drizzled over top to make this irresistible. Drooling yet?

Small restaurant so make sure to reserve a table - it's worth planning ahead!"}
{"text":"I was going to Yelp this earlier, but the County General sent me straight into a food coma once I got home. Well done, General, well done.

So I've been waiting to go to CG for lunch for a while now and today was my lucky day. Situated at the fantastic neighbourhood of Queen West, the restaurant location is top notch, with the large windows facing east. Natural light went perfectly with the wooden interiors. The decor was simple but classy.

Service was good but the food took quite a while to come out. We arrived at 1:30 ish, when probably the first lunch rush just ended and the second wave of late lunchers came in. Unfortunately, we were the last table to get our food.

The menu items were very well thought-out and put together. I had the fish cakes with vegan potato leek soup. Both delicious. The portion is potentially a little small for the big eaters out there (3 small fish cakes) but I was told of this beforehand, and that the quality of the cakes are really high and should be satisfying. They were. The fish cakes were so delicately made and the soy emulsion was paired so well. My friend had the Reuben which was a highly recommended item for you carnivores. I tried a bite and the flavour was really rich. Warning: it's greasy and drippy - if you have a hand/mouth/grease/mess-phobia when you're eating, stay away!

Apple pie for dessert - perfect amount of sweetness, for me. I'm not into extreme sweets but this was just right. Initially our pie was not too warm, so they took it back and gave us a new warm slice with ice cream on the side! Def added to our long meal time, but worth it. The vanilla ice cream they get (from Kawartha Dairy, I believe?) was really tasty... possibly my new fave vanilla ice cream! 

Overall great experience. Will definitely be back soon!

{"text":"We went to celebrate my belated birthday with my girlfriends and to be clear, I was the one who picked the restaurant. That said, I have to say that it is with sadness that I write this review. This was not my first time at The County General but it was my first disappointment. I was very excited to go there in the last week of  chef Garth Legree and as I had a great experience in the place not too long ago, my expectations were somewhat high.

The menu was new and our server had a hard time explaining the dishes, not to mention that she could not comment on the new dishes as she hadn't tried them. I may be too critical but any respectful establishment should not only explain the new dishes on the menu, but also have their staff tasting the dishes so they can comment on them and provide suggestions to patrons. 

I had the rib eye with an Italian red pepper sauce and broccoli and peanut. This is a dish meant to shared by two. In my humble opinion, the dish was just plain wrong. I could not even believe I was eating a rib eye. The meet was tough and not properly butchered. The sauce was bad, the rib eye was not cut against the grain and had a ton of cartilage.

The highlight of the night was the Jamaican ginger beer! I am sure I would still come back there because they have a fantastic chicken sandwich, great cocktails and a fun English bartender. The rest...not so much."}
{"text":"A five star in its category without any doubt. Cozy and nicely decorated, friendly staff, quick service and yummy food.
I didn't try any drink but they take it pretty serious with all flavors and spices they have at the bar. The lemonade ginger soft drink was perfect and refreshing.  We had chicken thigh sandwich and pulled pork and both of them were perfect and delicious. You can substitute the fries with with salad which had one of the best dressing I ever had. Will come again to try the KFC for two."}
{"text":"14 months living in the area and always wanted to go. Don't mind the noise don't mind the wait but $15 shitty Pinot ($25 @ lcbo) and that 'you can't find better' directly from the owner. It's here to stay cause of the allure but it's most people's one and done."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots! Really unique food with small portions great for sampling! My only gripe is that the change the menu quite often so I've fallen in love with a lot of things they no longer serve. C'est la vie"}
{"text":"10 of us went for the whole suckling pig roast. It was an AMAZING experience. We started with the bottle of whiskey which we mixed with this ginger lemonade which combined to create such a tasty drink (think basic, gingery whiskey sour). 

Then the pig came out whole so we could see it and take some pictures. They cut it all up for us and started bringing out plates. They had different types of bread, including baos and different sauce although it would have been nice to have some bbq sauce which they didn't have. They sides were also included; the kale ceasar was sooo good as were the roasted root vegetables.  When we wanted more sides they were brought out no charge and at the end of the night there was pig left over which we packed up with us. 

They also let you funnel the whiskey with the pigs ear! Super fun/ a litlle gross.
#homnomnom

I would definitely recommend this!"}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwiches and a good list of drinks. Conveniently close to Bell Trinity Park, so a nice dinner after an afternoon in the park."}
{"text":"YIKES. I had read that the service had attitude, but I didn't know what I was getting into. Watch out for the really tanned waitress who walks around the place like she rules the world. I've never seen such attitude for no apparent reason in my entire life. The one star is for the food that's fairly good. The rude waitress and generally bad service and disorganization was significant enough to destroy the other 4 stars.
They should make some staffing changes if they know what's good for them.."}
{"text":"This was the worst brunch of my life.  My husband and I each ordered a Huevos Rancheros with added chicken.  What arrived was basically a basket of tortilla chips with a small bit of scrambled eggs and barely a sprinkling of feta, some guacamole squeezed out of a tube, some cold refried beans squeezed out of a tube, and some fresh tomato salsa.  The chicken and salsa were very nice, however, there was so little actual substantial food amongst the chips, I literally left hungry.  The kicker?  $15 plus $5 for added chicken, making it a $40 meal + for the two of us.  Yikes.  The service was great and fast, but could not even begin to make up for the terrible meal.  Will never return.  This was the epitome of cheaping out and gouging to turn a huge profit on a simple meal.  Every Huevos Rancheros I've ever ordered has been a huge filling slather of eggs, beans, *fresh* made guacomole, gooey cheese, etc etc.  Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Still Hungry!! 
I am writing this review soley based on the brunch I had today that left me feeling unsatified and ripped off. I literally had to go to Tim Hortons to get a second breakfast.  Yes, Tim Hortons. How sad. 

First, let me say that I have worked in the hospitality industry for about 25 years and currently work for a food supplier so I have a very good understanding about food costing. I am in restaurants every day. 

I have heard good things about The County General and I will go back and hopefully have a better experience.  I loved the design and the service was good, however my $15 pulled pork eggs benedict was pretty disappointing.  My breakfast consisted of two under poached eggs on one piece of toast with approx 1.5 - 2oz of pork (served on the side?) and french fries.  Half of the egg was left behind it was so runny and there was nothing to soak it up with.  On the plus side, it did taste good - which is why i'm giving it 3 stars. Literally the smallest breakfast portion I have ever received in a restaurant.
I'm not looking to be full, but I do expect to be satisfied.  The total cost of this to the operator is about $1.50 max. That's a pretty good margin. So to look on the menu and see that I could have a burger, chicken thighs or trout dinner  for about the same price. I am feeling pretty ripped off. 
So, in the end I spent $23, then had to go spend another $4 at Tim Hortons to stop my stomach from rumbling. 
I will go back, but not for their brunch!"}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend and we loved it!  Its a super cute little space and both the food and service were great.  We had the chicken for 2 and it was delicious.  It came with some yummy dipping sauces and some tasty little biscuits.  The server was super friendly and overall I really dug the vibe.  Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I've only been for brunch and have had the grilled cheese and the chicken thigh sandwich-both very tasty and unique. Seating is a bit uncomfortable, close tables (if you can even get one) and they don't take resos. Drinks are so great that the bar is happening even at 1pm in the afternoon-I've never seen so many people order booze at brunch"}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Great food and good selection, my husband loves the pulled pork and I love the vegan options, fantastic menu, great food, cool spot!"}

The County General appeared out of nowhere (for me) and then it started getting all these reviews online. It seemed to be one of the next hot spot to dine at, with bloggers writing about them one day after another. Also, I was seeing one of bloggers I follow on twitter going back to The County General one night after another- when I see people going back to same restaurant so many times, it makes me think that this restaurant must be something special, yes?

I was seeing reviews and pictures online over and over until I decided that it was time for me to check it out. If it's that good, I wanted it to become my go-to place as well- and to be one of few who tried it out first! (This was back in early January)

I dropped by the restaurant on a weekday with 4 other people around 8pm and it was packed already. I tried to make reservation but apparently they don't take it for dinner time.

There were 3-4 groups waiting before we arrived so we waited around 30 minutes before we were finally seated.

Everyone working there was super friendly and attentive. Overall I really liked the atmosphere because it made me feel like I was at some neighborhood restaurant just around the corner.

Ordered: Rosemary Lemonade 4/5

* Glass of lemonade with hint of rosemary for $3
* This was super refreshing and it was different from your ordinary lemonade with the rosemary scent
* It had stronger hint of rosemary than I thought it would

Ordered: Two Way Fried Chicken 3/5

* Tamari Glazed, County Spice Rub and Lettuce Wrap for $36
* I was really excited to try this because I've seen pictures and it looked amazing
* Served with BBQ sauce, guacamole, radish, chili, green onions, homemade kimchi, red onions, cilantro and ginger
* Lettuce is served in a dimsum basket
* Chicken is fresh and juicy, you can def tell that it's good quality
* Home made KimChi  was actually quite decent (better than some kimchi served at Korean restaurants)
* BBQ sauce was little spicy which went well with the chicken
* For $36, chicken is small and it's not enough to be shared between 2 people
* I shared it with my sister and we were still hungry after the meal
* You are suppose to take a chicken piece and wrap it in lettuce with some of the condiments
* With the lettuce wrap and kimchi, this was korean bbq ssam style
* I am glad I tried it but it's not something I would go back for

Ordered: Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich 4/5

* Buttermilk chicken, milk bun, avocado chutney, coriander, green onion and fries for $12
* Another popular dish off from their menu
* Many reviews mention how small these burgers are
* This is really that small, the chicken itself is decent size but the milk bun is tiny
* Chicken is super fresh and crispy
* It's basically taking all the condiments from the Two Way Fried Chicken and making a burger with it
* The bun is soft and compliments the meat with avocado chutney 
* Def different from your ordinary chicken burger

Ordered: Frites 5/5

* Bowl of fries for $3
* Fries were crispy but a little too salty
* Good to order as a side if you are sharing two way fried chicken with someone else

Summary: 

I enjoyed my experience at The Country General and am glad I paid a visit. However, I wasn't really fully satisfied when I left. I do understand the quality over quantity structure, but for the price I paid- I didn't get much food.  I loved the concept, but didn't love the price. For what they serve and the type of cuisine they work with, I felt that it was a little too pricey overall."}
{"text":"Came in to the restaurant at about the same time as 2 other couples, and were seated immediately.  The restaurant hadn't become full until we arrived.  We ordered an appetizer and 2 mains, and the appetizer (Bone Marrow) came out fairly quickly, but we waited a very very long time for the mains to come out.

The waiter didn't check on or say anything to us until 25-30 minutes after we had finished the appetizer, saying our food was on the way.  The other 2 couples had pretty much finished their meals and our mains had not arrived yet.  After waiting another 10 minutes we decided to leave.  My guess is that he forgot to put the order for our mains in.  We would have been ok with the wait if the waiter wasn't so smug and matter-of-fact about things."}
{"text":"My brother is a huge fan of this place. I agree the drinks are awesome. It's a small place with limited seating and a nice little patio in the summer. Came here for lunch, and it wasn't as good. The food was decent, but not great compared with dinner. SOuthern cuisine done quite well."}
{"text":"Drank the best Gin & Tonics here. The bartender really takes pride in making his own tonic water and generally a drink nerd you need when you're looking to sip on the best. Atmosphere is cozy and the music isn't too loud. Try the fried chicken and waffles if you get the chance. Hands down the best within the West Queen West neighborhood."}
{"text":"came here for brunch with a friend, who had suggested it based on its meat-happy dishes. we waited only 10 minutes for a table, and there were a lot of attractive hipster patrons, if you like a side of eye candy with your brunch.

service was great. the hostess gave great recommendations and was very helpful. my friend ordered the chicken thigh sandwich and i ordered the pulled pork eggs benedict. 

she was highly complimentary of her sandwich, and i loved mine as well. the consistency of the hollandaise was perfect, and there was more pulled pork than i expected to get. so it was a happy surprise. 

would definitely come here again. happy customer."}
{"text":"Overpriced, meh food. Cheeseburger was OK if a little small for $17. Fries were tiny potato remnants, mostly about 3cm long or less. Fried chicken looks undercooked and skin is a bit slimy, but I was explained that it's brined for 24 hours and cooked sous vide for 2 hours, and always served a little pink. Apparently lots of people ask about this, but nowhere does it explain that on the menu or anywhere in the restaurant. It's also not particularly good for all the work they put into it. COB salad was edible, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich.
Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich.
Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich.

I had a dream about this sandwich ($14).
In my dream it was still one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had.
* Juicy and crispy buttermilk fried chicken
* Some sort of small slightly sweet milk bun
* Avocado Chutney

We came here for brunch.  
I feel like I'll never be able to try their brunch because all I want is another sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing! Went for brunch with a few friends and we all enjoyed our meals. Drinks were great as well. A perfect start to the weekend."}
{"text":"On a cool night, we went to County General for a quick bite, and were surprised by the quality of the food as well as its originality.  I had the daily special of fried sweet breads and pork on polenta, and liked the chef's use of crunchy, smooth, and fatty items in the dish.

The chef here also has other techniques seldom used, including coriander seeds cooked in a gastrique of vinegar and sugar in the salad.  For bonus points, I was able to point out what used to be at my place on their mural print of 19th century Toronto.

This place has made it into my favourites list."}
{"text":"Mr. H found this place in his never ending quest for awesome cocktails. We finally made the trip and it was so worth it.

Although their most popular drink is the Old Fashioned, we had to pick other options because they ran out of the ingredients needed. Mr. H had the Manhattan and I had both the Generals Cup (yum!) and the Drifter (double yum!!). The drinks were fantastic but of course we had to try their Fried Chicken as well. The bartender recommended the beans to go with it and I hate beans! The beans came first and I decided to give it a go since I was starving. It tasted so good! The mix of garlic and lime was so delicious that I now look at beans in a whole new light. 

The Fried Chicken is a treat, they serve it on a wax paper placed in front of you, the server places the chicken and then describes the sauces and topping while she pours it in front of you. Mr. H who is a health freak wiped it clean... it's the first time I've had fried chicken and not felt sick after. That's an accomplishment.

This place is definitely going on the 'return-to' list."}
{"text":"Unique spin on great food. the chicken sandwich is a dinner fave, the eggs benny and croque madam are awesome for brunch!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 7 on a Wednesday and were seated right away. The service was friendly but we felt sort of rushed through the meal. It would make sense if it was a bit busier, but there were free tables around, specially near the end of our meal, so I was perplexed. Perhaps they're too used to having to do that on the weekends. 

The food itself was decent. I had the mussels in toasted coconut curry with county fries and remoulade. My friend had the buttermilk fried chicken thigh sandwich with fries. The mussels were okay. I wish they took on more of the curry flavour. The fries and remoulade were fantastic, and the homemade ketchup was really good too. I enjoyed the fried chicken sandwich more than the mussels. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and so juicy. 

Next time, I'll try the County Fried Chicken, which seems to have been nicknamed Korean Fried Chicken by you lot. I ordered the mussels because on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 6-10 it comes with Woodhouse lager for $18."}
{"text":"5 star food. 4 star service. 1 or less stars for the bar manager who fucked up our visit. Just rude and unhelpful. And seemed like we didn't want to be there"}
{"text":"Can I just start with stating how much I love bourbon, and how many mixed drinks they had that were bourbon based xD? 

Anyhow, I ordered the fried chicken thigh sandwich, added bacon and cheese (CAUSE WHAT IN LIFE IS NOT GOOD WITH CHEESE AND BACON? Shh, I can hear you trying to think of something. Stop. Wasted effort.) and I'd like to add it was delicious. For $2 I only got one slice of what I didn't originally notice as bacon, so that may have not been as good of an idea as I originally thought but whatevs, bacon. The cheese, however, super melty and beautiful. The \"avocado chutney\" which, unless you're unfamiliar with what chutney is, is basically guacamole, was savory and creamy; the pickled onion (I know, sounds gross right?) were surprisingly sweet and crunchy, contributing to the sandwich well, and the chicken, which was definitely in properly marinated in buttermilk (which makes the best chicken btw, you should try it at home one day w/ onions and your favourite seasonings) stacked between two creamy, milk buns, was yummy. Don't let the size of this thing fool you, the sandwich and the fries (lightly salted, ketchup on the side, real potatoes) are definitely filling. 

And the bourbon cocktail, wheewh! Delicious. Made strong, just the way I like it. 

The only con is  the quantity for the price. The sandwich looks small, the cocktail comes in a mini mason jar, and upon first sight, you'll wonder why you're here, but its definitely a worthwhile experience. 

Decor: rustic-y; plates that remind me of my mother and her fleamarket obsession of the early 90's, checkered cloth napkins, mason jars- a very country-ee feel. Thus why I suspect its called the county gen (harhar, I'm brilliant I know.) 

That, and also the water comes in old liquor bottles. Looks cool! 

Only thing: come before 4, as it was busy when I got there, there's only one server, and seating is limited. Other than that, enjoy! 

(P.S. BOURBON!!)"}

Went for brunch even tho this place seems to be known for exciting drink options. Had the chicken fried sandwich ($16) with fries which was very tasty and well done. Tried the county burger ($16) with salad as well. The burger is good if you like horse radish otherwise maybe pass on this. Salad was great. The dressing is light. 

The environment is very relaxed and decor was somewhat is a country, barn mash up. This place also has a lot of love for Jack Daniels whiskey.

Would come back for a slow morning brunch to enjoy the scenery. Would recommend the more interesting items on the list. The grilled cheese and \"the greesy spoon\" didn't pop out as anything different than your roommates cooking."}
{"text":"Was sort of looking forward to this place... But no dice. I came here on a rainy Friday night for drinks. You'd think from all the wood and rooster knick-knacks there would be cosy feeling. But sadly, it wasn't there. We ordered lackluster drinks that tasted like boozy lemon tea (great for a patio day!) and chicken wings.  The wings had what looked like a homemade sauce on them (yum!) but were undercooked (yuck). 

All in all the place felt like a university bar trying a bit too hard."}
{"text":"I had the fried chicken thigh sandwich which was really good. The chicken was very tender and juicy. My only qualm was the cilantro (not a big fan of cilantro) in the sandwich which I forgot to ask for it to be removed. I came with a friend and they had the porchetta which was equally as good. She said the potato salad was also very good. Also tried the margarita (a little on the pricey side as the drink cost as much as my meal), but was also very good. Enough kick without being too bitter.

Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I very rarely give low reviews so when I do, you bet the restaurant sucks! In fact, it has to suck a lot.

My boyfriend and I came here for date night. Upon coming in we were told to seat ourselves, we chose a table near the front and watched as the waitress brought out some fried chicken for the table next to us (it looked very good). We waited for around 20 minutes and no one had come to our table to set up the table and bring us water. My bf whispered to me \"5 more minutes and we're leaving\". That probably should have been a sign that the restaurant was no good. However, a few minutes later, a disheveled waitress showed up with a cask of water and two glasses. 

We were definitely ready to order by then (also because we looked at the menu before coming) but without asking, she left again and didn't come back until 15 minutes later. By that time I was haaaaaangry. We got the county fried chicken as that's what we had come here to eat. It looked very delicious but turned out to be very under-seasoned, under-whelming and over-cooked. (aka cooked until the chicken was dry) Overall, it was pretty expensive ($40 for the 2lb Country Fried Chicken) with not much flavour and the service was non-existent. DO NOT EAT HERE (if you value your money and calories)!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, the wait is 45mins to 1 hour for a Saturday brunch.  The french toast wasn't crispy enough for my liking at a price point of $1.  The chocolate banana pancake snack was pretty good for $5.  Eggs Bennedict were decent, 1 egg was poached perfectly, but the other was half overcooked as it only oozed a tiny bit of yolk.  The sausage and egg were good.  Someone shared their duck confit and we all felt it was too dry and overcooked as well."}
{"text":"Came here early Sunday morning with my best friend before her dress fitting. We originally wanted to go to Lady Marmalade but the line up was ridiculous! Service here was very fast, very friendly. And they always made sure our water glasses were always full. 
I ordered the pulled pork eggs Benedict.
THE BEST pulled pork eggs benedict I ever tried/had! The pulled pork was so tender, and the spices in the pork married very well with the perfectly poached eggs (check out that runny #eggporn though ) and hollandaise sauce! The veggies added a refreshing crunch to the dish. The eggs benedict was slightly spicy too, which I LOVED! Definitely bringing the FHubs here to try it out because I know he will love the pulled pork (he's a huge fan of pulled pork in general! )"}
{"text":"OMG! If I ever have to choose a last meal, I'm coming here! The fried chicken for two was da bomb! Mic drop!!!"}
{"text":"General, you deserve a dishonorable discharge.

Their \"Fried\" Chicken = Burnt on the Grill Poulette.
AND the dishes were SMALL. $14 mains is the norm.

Reclaimed-wood-style joint, designed for Queen W bitter-shop shoppers
(who are you?) and 905ers wishing to bathe in some chic grease. 

Some might label it under \"Hipster\", but this would actually attribute some style sensibilities. 
This place is more like Joey's does it hipster."}
{"text":"The food was decent, and bonus points for having a good gluten free burger buns. However, I felt it was overpriced for what you get. I ordered takeout and I was really craving a hearty burger and fries and I was still hungry afterwards. The fries they gave me were just the little bits that were probably just sitting at the bottom of the fryer. Overall, I was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"The 6oz County General Burger was one of the most satisfying burgers I had slayed in a long time. It came topped with mustard, mayo, pickles and ottawa valley cheddar on a milk bun. I ordered it medium rare and it came perfectly medium rare - 140 °F exploding with juice. Near the top of the menu there it states that to anything on the menu you can smoked bacon to it for $3 and a fried egg for $1...So I added both to the burger! 

When the burger arrived it looked much smaller than I had imagined in my head, however don't be fooled by cover. By the time I savoured the last bite I was fully satisfied and went on using fries to wipe up the yolk based puddle below me. 

Crucial facts:

-fries are well done
-neat wooden platters are used instead of plates
-mediocre service
-every year of El Dorado Rum (Guyana) available
-house hot sauce is scotch bonnet based and excrutiatingly hot

I will definitely be back to the general to try the fried chicken thigh sandwich and the rest of their neat cocktails."}
{"text":"Came here on Canadian Thanksgiving for a lovely brunch. Their mushroom and leek omelet was FANTASTIC. Highly recommend it. Their french fries were also delicious, and I like that they do half fries half salad. Brunch. Essential.

Beautiful space, but tables are small and close together, so be prepared to be cozy to the people sitting next to you!"}
{"text":"This small joint has friendly staff, a fun atmosphere, and great drinks. There is a small but good local beer list and their fried chicken for 2 is a sight to be seen. A must order for dinner. For apps, Their pork buns are great, order one of each. Try the cocktail of the day, listed on the board and get to know the awesome bartenders."}
{"text":"The dish we specifically went for was spectacular-  fried chicken done two ways - all cutlery is cleared, wax paper is laid down, and the chicken is tipped straight onto the table, dressed in front of you and you dive in hands first. delightful! 

That said, the bored-looking, gum-chewing, unknowledgeable wait staff really detracted from the experience  (Sorry i don't know ontario wines was our waiter's response to a wine question, in a restaurant which only offers ontario wines!)"}
{"text":"Just a huge Thanks to the fine folks at County General for an outstanding 
Experience last night. Great Food! Great service! Best Mushroom Caps EVER!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails and environment. Maybe expected a little bit more in terms of friendly service."}
{"text":"Went there with my roommate when we were craving a really tasty meal. Not disappointed!!! We shared the beet goat cheese salad to start and the gnocchi. I highly recommend the gnocchi, so good. I got the burger with fries and she got the chicken thigh sandwich with house salad. Both very very good and very friendly service. Bartender/server was very sweet and friendly, he brought us some dipping sauces to try (aioli and scotch bonnet hot sauce) which amped up the flavours even more. We saw the people beside us getting the fried chicken for two, next time defiantly getting that. Also they have a rib special during one day of the week so we'll be back for that. Delicious, filling, friendly, comfortable atmosphere, no complaints."}
{"text":"I came in on a Wednesday for lunch. It restaurant was already half full by 1:00pm. The place is very cozy and cool (to sit and chill). I ordered the popular choice, fried chicken sandwich. It looked a lot smaller than an average \"sandwich/burger size\", but honestly, it filled me up. The chicken was very tender and the bun was just the right amount of chewiness. And as my side, I got a garden salad and it was seasoned soooo well! Glad I got the healthier choice because it was delicious! As a nice gesture, they gave me a small fruit salad. I ate and actually didn't like it at all. Glad that was free. Overall the experience was nice. The waitress isn't the friendliest, but she did her job. The other waiter was always attentive and kept pouring the water in our cups whenever he saw it low. :) very nicely done Monsieur! I'd definitely come back. The food was quality."}
{"text":"This is a solid place without a doubt! I enjoyed my burger and salad which had great flavour. Portions were pretty small but hit the spot. Prices for drinks  are steep considering u can order a meal there for the same price as a drink but they are very generous pours. It's a good vibe here and I like how they have platters to share. Nice intimate atmosphere w great music selection."}
{"text":"I just moved into the neighbourhood and there are a lot wicked places to eat. County G is one of the best. Yummy cocktails and snacks - who knew chickpeas could taste so good as fries?  I didn't get to order the KFC but want to! It looks amaze and the presentation is fun all spread out on the table. They have mini macs, like every other snack menu in town, but they make them with pork belly which is a nice little twist.  County G is in my top 5..."}
{"text":"I just didn't like it.

I liked my drink.  But it was 5 sips worth, and I much prefer the margarita at La Carnita.  My food was uninspired. I've had a better pork bun (noodle bar), better 'big mac' (416 snack bar), better chicken wings, better cornbread and better crispy duck (which was so sad. How can you mess up crispy duck!?).   The root bear cheesecake smelled like buttered popcorn and tasted like plain ol' cheesecake*.

I just didn't \"get\" it.  I liked the vibe, the service was whatever (neither here nor there), the bathroom was nice.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again, but if someone brought me there, I would go to be polite.  Definite room for vast improvement.

*I did not do the ordering on this occasion."}
{"text":"Just finished having the most delicious brunch here! According to the people sitting next to our table, the Cesar's are to die for! Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to try one but will definitely be returning. 

We ordered the county burger and the fried chicken thigh sandwich. Both were very delicious and came with either a side of fries or a salad. I would highly recommend the salad as it wasn't your typical iceberg lettuce but a Boston lettuce base with sliced radish and cucumber and I believe a balsamic dressing. 

The county burger was very juicy. If you enjoy eating horseradish, there's a very strong horseradish flavour in this dish. I could have used a little less of sauce in my burger but overall, I still enjoyed it and would recommend it. 

The fried chicken thigh sandwich was also delicious. The chicken was very juicy and there was just the right amount of crisp on the outside. 

Overall, the county general is small, quaint and very clean. It's great for small groups but would definitely recommend reservations if you are a large group as there isn't much seating. :) 

I also have to commend the staff for their excellent service."}
{"text":"Can confirm that the dishes are adult prices at child's portions. The pork sandwich was tasty though. But yeah, it's not much bigger than a slider."}
{"text":"My fiancee and i have been here a number of times - from visiting and checking multiple times for our space on the waiting list to sit when they first opened, to bringing our family there whenever we can now that the initial hype has calmed slightly.

It truly is one of our favourites in Toronto for modern Canadian food, amazing cocktails (thanks Jeff Carroll!) - especially their signature Sunday Picnic and County Drive In... absolutely love those and you will too.

We've enjoyed their awesome Croque Madame for Sunday brunch, and for dinner service here are our favourites:

Chicken Thigh Sandwish - juicy and flavourful; awesome since they opened.

Trio of Pork Buns - so tasty, soft steamed buns; great for sharing!

Two Way Fried Chicken -- you will absolutely love it... packed with flavour, and so awesome to share amongst ~4 people after they dump it directly on the table. Yes you will feel like an animal but the trendy place doesn't make you look like one - all of us carnivores are doing it.

Atmostphere is excellent, though sometimes music can be too loud. They have been very accomodating to nudge it down a bit for us. Really enjoy this place i can't say enough."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and got the chicken thigh sandwich with salad for the side.  The sandwich was great as was the salad.  Will come again soon for the rest of the menu.  Awesome."}
{"text":"She dumped saucy, crispy Korean Fried Chicken ($40, enough for two) on wax paper in front of us two skinny girls.  And of course(!) we wanted the coriander and squirt of mystery green sauce!  When she left, we also dumped our plate of unrelated salad on too, inspired.  Then we mawed down.  Mau-ed?  Mowed?  The couple-on-a-date next to us salivated over our thighs and breast meat--we got the LAST order of this KFC at 8:30pm.

The drinks were so horribly over-priced, we opted for the spiked cider and lime-ade, which were like, $5 each.  Because a chicken dinner bill does not need to be $70 on a Monday.  They were love-potion good, btw.

Bad points? Girl was indolent and slack-jawed (until the chicken actually came, we were orphaned).  Maybe she shared in the effects of the County General's dimmer switch?  It was dark.  Service like that was the only salmonella-y thing.  Tears mixed into our tabledumpful.

All said, nothing, NOTHING could mitigate the PURE BLISS of that meat.  Go.  Maybe not on a Monday night shift (?)."}
{"text":"Wanted to give 5 stars, but just not quite there.

Food was very good. Two in the group had the Beet and Hummus sandwich and said it was very good.  Another had the burger and said is was good. I had the Chicken Thigh Sandwich which was good, but not great. (food is 3.5 stars)

The bar is excellent.  They have a nice beer selection and know how to make good craft cocktails.  Very nice. (bar is 5 stars)

They also were very professional and able to accommodate a sever peanut allergy with one of the members of our party. (Service and attitude 5 stars)

What was odd was the very loud heavy metal being played.  I don't mean loud and a bit edgy. I mean silly loud.  At 7:30 PM.  It was odd and took quite a bit away from the experience."}
{"text":"3.5*

Contemporary rustic ambience, great, friendly service, good but really pricy food. 

I had the deep fried chicken thigh sandwich. 
the chicken was juicy but it wasn't very deep fried. the sandwich was also TINY and really difficult to eat because it was tiny but piled high. 
more like a slightly bigger slider than a normal sized burger or sandwich. it was pretty tasty, but for $14...definitely very pricy. 

after inhaling the sandwich, which came with fries, we had to go to Nadege for macarons and other desserts. 

nice to try once, but not sure i'd come back"}
{"text":"The drink prices here SUCK. $15 for a regular glass of red wine? No thanks. Food is good. However, service is slow and the music selection of angsty rock will make any conversation near impossible."}
{"text":"Pemeal bacon on the eggs benny is as fresh as it gets.  Homemade rim/celery salt on the ceasars is unreal.  The banana bread french toast...do i even need to opine? the name speaks for itself.  Great ambiance, staff, and delicious food. All the muskoka brewery beers you've heard of and more, and a rum/bourbon roster as deep as any in the city.  Do yourself a favor."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place but the food was over priced and terrible. Don't have the eggs Benny, the smoke on the hollandaise is so over done that you can't taste any of the small portion you get for $14. When we sent back the food they offered us a free entrée but nothing else on the bench menu looked good, truly a miss.

The service was good and the drinks and drink selection is fantastic and I'd return for drinks but never for food. Such a disappointment for a place that should have a stellar brunch menu considering it's location"}
{"text":"Wish we had known the following before we came and dropped $50+ on fried chicken. Important to note that the head chef left years ago. Their once-famous \"Korean Fried Chicken\" is no longer here. Instead, it seems the remaining chefs have tried to recreate the previous chef's supposed masterpiece (can't say, never tried it but reviews/videos from his time look amazing), falling way short in terms of quality and taste. Yet, they somehow justify raising the price up to $44 for two portions which consists of sandy breading that is fused to somewhat moist dark meat and dry pieces of white meat. For the same price (even less if you go during their happy hour), you're better off going to Bar Fancy just down the street and getting truly the best fried chicken in town.

Seems like they have other popular offerings here (brunch, jerk chicken). Maybe they should just take the fried chicken off the menu."}
{"text":"Their Chicken Sandwich is made out of fresh ingrediences and is simple but very good. Nevertheless its expensive and small.

- Rating only for the food. Price doesnt make a difference."}
{"text":"I could give them a 5 alone for the single thing I had ordered here to eat in my one and only visit to the place because I was THAT impressed.

Friday afternoon a bit of a late lunch mid afternoon and my Yelp buddy Colin and I came here while on a Queen West crawl for some real sit down food.  

To start off this place is kind of tiny yes.  They say they have events inside with parties hosting dozens but I look at the space and I can't see how you can fit that many people in here but they do one way or another and as long as they aren't breaking the law it's all good.  

Now on the the food... The table is a thick wooden chopping block type of surface with a thick and solid feel to it.  When we had ordered drinks and the KFC for two little did I know what was in store.  For those that aren't aware these days KFC is commonly known as \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\" you know that Colonel Sanders place where the cole slaw is the color of pistachio ice cream and the macaroni salad is neon orange (colors inspired by Gatorade perhaps?).  

NO.  Hell no am I talking about that KFC.  KFC is for Korean Fried Chicken which has these days taken over my whole fried chicken desire both gladly and sadly at the same time.  I can't keep eating this dish with such frequency.  I grow worrisome about my health!.  Still if you're going to indulge yourself with deep fried chicken and you do it as (cough) occasionally as I do consider the Country General as one of your next stops to partake in a completely unhealthy way to cook such a delectable dish.

So back to our cutting board kind of table... our server comes over and brings this parchment paper type of covering for our table and I'm thinking... OK I mean sure I can be messy but it's not like I have a coaster for my drink and I'm not THAT messy.  This table is wood ok so he just wants to protect it... ok no worries mate it's all good I just wasn't expecting a piece of paper on our table after we were seated - NO biggie.

Then our server returns with our \"KFC for Two\"... he's holding a tray with 2 plates of chicken and all these garnishes and stuff.  At this point I'm just expecting him to place the plates of chicken down on the paper and we're about to help outselves to the food and in the back of my mind I'm thinking that hey, we don't have any side plates...

then BOOM!... buddy dumps the plate on to the table, just right onto the paper in the middle of us both... shaking the plate to make sure all the sauce comes off and then grabs the 2nd plate and then BOOM also dumps that plate on the the middle of the table.  

He then goes on to start sprinkling sesame seeds all over the chicken and then grabs some sort of other purple chopped vegetable (he said what it was but I think I was too blown away to absorb what it was) and then shakes something green and leafy on top and then grabs a squeeze bottle of green stuff and starts drizzling our mound of chicken that's on the table and also giving us each a healthy squeeze swirl of sauce each at the end.  

I was like Whiskey Tango Foxtrot just happened?  I just witnessed something I've not seen before at any other restaurant happen at this tiny little bar at the corner of Shaw and Queen.

It was like watching an artist put together an abstract in under a minute right in front of me.  The last few artistic squirts of sauce actually came pretty close to my phone but what a show even if it was more of a skit.  I was so shocked to see what just happened I had almost forgot we had to eat.

The chicken came in two different flavors while one was spicier the other was sweeter but both were good.  There was 2 drum sticks and 2 unsplit wings in the process so it's like split an entire chicken but those were the only bones we had to deal with as the rest was boneless.  It wasn't super filling but wow for 38 bucks and the tastes and presentation it's like something just so amazing and cool for a small bar.  Honestly I wasn't expecting to be served like that but it was a most pleasant surprise and it wasn't all glitz, the food was really good too.

Normally I'm against having KFC with such a quantity of sauce but the flavor made up for it.  The chicken itself wasn't overly crunchy as most KFC places make it whether thinly battered or with a thicker version this version was more the taste and mix of ingredients than the crisp of the chicken itself which in itself isn't exactly what I've seen in my past experiences with KFC but this was definitely the most unique attempt at putting something out there that's WAY different from everything else out there with the taste of the dish to back it up.

The County General is trying to get their lunch on these days.  They have a loyalty card and offer 10 dollar specials for lunch as well.  While they have 2 locations on Queen, this one we went to is on the west side and the other is on the east side.

At this point if you called heads or tails you'd win either way.  Cool idea... good food and service."}
{"text":"Next, the Crispy Pig Ears arrived.  I believe I have had fried pig ears before but not in this fashion.  The pig ears were fried and definitely crispy and a little spicy.  There was a container of sauce made of maple syrup, scallion, and spicy mayo.  Mmm, this was absolutely divine!!  The crispy pig ears were like potato chips, once you start, you just can't stop!  There were such delectable and tasty snacks that completely satisfied my taste buds' preference for salty and savory bite-sized snacks.  The combination of spicy mayo, scallion, and maple syrup was also an absolute perfect sauce.  I absolutely loved this!"}
{"text":"Have been to County General multiple times with many different kinds of people with different tastes, and have never left with a disappointed person. 

My preferred day to visit is Sundays. In the evening it's relatively empty. We never have problems getting a table. It should be noted that it's rather small location, so going with a big group isn't ideal. If there are 4 of you, you're fine. 

I also like going on Sunday evenings, because I absolutely love their \"Sunday Bunday\" special which is available after 5 pm: fresh made sticky buns with a variety of fillings and sauces, served with apple slaw on the side. My favourite is the fried chicken and pulled pork, but they also have veggie options. The sauces are served in little squeeze bottles and include sesame seed mayo, \"poison coffee\" and a flavourful and potent hot sauce. All this comes served on a platter, so some assembly required which I prefer. I can choose what I like and how much of it there is. You can buy extra buns if you have more filling left over. 

Service has always been great. I've always had the same server, the Abercrombie and Fitch model looking guy who is attentive, pleasant, and checks on us frequently. I really appreciate good service. 

All in all, really good, quiet spot for a small group of friends to chat and eat some good food."}
{"text":"**1/2 stars

In the mood for something a little more casual we stumbled upon The County General, the joint I've been meaning to check out for some time for the famed fried chicken thigh sandwich.

I must say I really love the décor.  Panels of wood line the ceiling leading to an impressive wall of jenga-like blocks with the signature white coq serving as the focal point.  Mr. Pig makes an appearance alongside with \"Eat Me\" scribbled on the chalkboard he holds up.  Atop the bar shelves you'll find heads of various carnivores adorned with the likes of sunglasses.  I thought they were quite cute.

The rectangular restaurant does not allow for a whole lot of seating though the space seems more accommodating towards large groups than small ones.

The young staff here are all very easy-going and while I wouldn't call them inattentive, they work at their own pace.

We opted to start with the Trio of Steamed Pork Buns ($12) with green apple slaw, avocado chutney and kimchee served with a bottle of hot sauce for those wanting to add a little heat.  The steamed buns were spot on, elastic but soft and supple - I dare say even better than most Chinese restaurants make.  My favourite flavour was the green apple slaw, with the kimchee being a nay for me.  It just overpowered the flavour of the pork.

Then came the infamous Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich ($14) which gets a lot of \"tender\" lovin' care, being done up sous-vide for an extra juicy bird.  However, where the texture wins, the flavour loses out.  This had to have been one of the blandest fried chicken sandwiches I've had and adding no salt to injury with the use of a rather mild-flavoured avocado does nothing to save the poor clucker.  We opted for a side of fries instead of salad which was served with a delicious house-made ketchup.  I think the Bibb lettuce would've had more crispiness to it.  Maybe I should've ordered the salad after all.

If you're a fan of variety then skip dessert because there is but one.  Tonight it was a Peanut Butter Trifle layered with cake, peanut brittle and chocolate mousse.  They should change their name to Pirate General as discovering the layers was like digging for treasure.  Perhaps serving it in a mason jar so that you could see all the layers would be a good compass to navigate my incomplete spoonfuls of dessert.  The texture of the mousse was a little off for me and the presentation could use some work.  Flavour-wise it was not bad.

Our bill came to $45 including tax and tip.  My meal here was like a roller coaster.  It started on a high with the steamed pork bun trio, then a low with the chicken thigh sandwich, and then the ride was over with the mediocre dessert.

And as you may or may not know, the restaurant is Carlo Catallo and Victor Barry's (Splendido) stab at casual dining.  If I were mom and dad, I'd say Splendido is the overachieving older child who never fails to please and the County General would be younger spoiled brat who doesn't give a sh!t about pleasing the parents."}
{"text":"Stopped in on  Sunday somwehere between brunch and dinner and got a seat right away. With the 'no reservations' trend in this city, we've taken to eating at weird times in order to try the \"it\" places without the hours of waiting. So far, so good.

I began my order with a County Drive In cocktail, which was a beautiful pink color  and arrived in a nice tall mug. While I was skeptical at first of the combination of ingredients, I was pleasantly surprised by how refreshing it was and really enjoyed it. Not enough, however, to order another at $12/pop.

We had some oysters to start. They were fine, and the apple mignonette was delicious, although there could have been more of it. 

From there, we went on to split a burger and the chicken thigh sandwich.

The burger was small but tasty, albeit a bit overcooked since we ordered it medium and there was NO pink in the center. 

Now, the chicken thigh sandwich was just the opposite. It WAS pink in the center, and the texture was a little questionable, too. When we called our server over to let her know, she assured us that it was just a result of their cooking method (sous vide followed by  flash fry) and that all bacteria had been killed. She did not offer to cook the chicken more; she told us if we were uncomfortable eating it we should order something else. At that point, we were pretty grossed out and called it quits. 

I was super bummed out about the chicken because I was looking forward to coming back with friends to try the KFC chicken- it looks so delicious and fun! However, if they use the same cooking method on that chicken as they do on the thigh sandwich, I'm afraid that's a dealbreaker. Even if it IS safe (which I'm not sure I buy) it was still disgusting."}
{"text":"Really disappointing, ate Breakfast here this morning, I had a egg Benedict only to receive it so runny that it was barely cooked, our waitress didnt even come back to check up on us or to ask how the food was. Second time I have come here this year and been thoroughly dissapointed. Establishments like this add to the crappy food that is available in the city and on Queen St. Places like this wont be around for much longer if they continue this."}
{"text":"Finger licking tasty ! 

We came here for lunch on a lovely Friday afternoon. It was one of the few places in the area still serving at 3pm. 

It's small but has great character. We sat by the window and people watched. 

The portions aren't huge but they are filling. We got the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and the county club. Both were succulent and every bite was juicy. 

I recommend both. 

It's a bit on the pricier side $15 each, but a great treat. Too bad we were still stuffed and couldn't have dessert. 

Yum."}
{"text":"The County General should be called The Dam, Woodchucks, or Termite Haven...
Here, it's wooden everything. The bar, the tables, the floors, and even the wooden palettes they serve your food on. Not a problem as much as just an interesting move. 

I was looking forward to the County General. It's best described as modern hipster. Hipster because the diners are all pretty much hipsters, and the servers are just as casual as the food they serve. The prices also reflect the growing rent costs around the neighborhood. 

My group of 3 arrived around 1:40PM for Sunday brunch. Walking in was difficult and a bit uncomfortable. It was a small place that had a smaller standing area. We had to constantly press our backs against the wall so that the busy waitress could do her job. After around 8 minutes we were seated. Not at the bar but at a couples seat. I didn't have too many issues with that, but in consideration to the other diners 5 inches beside us, we were cramped while seated. This made getting up, getting in and out very difficult for everyone.

Other than it being a small \"woody\" space, the environment was casual but busy. It's ideal for couples and maybe a date. The brunch choices were simple and limited. Although I rarely have a big issue with small menus, this one was probably the smallest I've had to order from. The brunch selection had about 7 items, larger than the 5 items from the lunch menu, making both menus bare boned.   

We all ordered the Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich with fries/salad. This sandwich was really delicious. Very tasty, seasoned right, juicy and creamy from the avocado. Probably the best chicken sandwich I've had. The cilantro and avocado really sets the sandwich apart. The fries were also very good, especially with the dipping sauce which tasted like chalet sauce... Both components were delicious.

My one gripe was that the portions were pretty small. Given the semi-selections of the menu, I expected something more filling to justify. Although delicious, it was not worth the full 14$ bucks. My buddy actually mentioned that he contemplated over ordering another dish, although expensive. He was still hungry. Beer is also expensive. $5 for a bottle of tankhouse? That's local domestic beer in a bottle...

For whatever reason the server wasn't too polite when it came to paying our bill. Some wanted to pay with debit/credit. The server expected us to know exactly how much we wanted to pay each. Without the time split the bill and calculate in our heads at that moment, we simply didn't know and said so. She gave us attitude and made it seem like it was a big hassle for her to print 3 bills of the same order so we could pay accordingly. Could have been an off day for her or a classic County General faux pas, but it left an anger that lasted for one of us that day. 

Overall the food was good. They served the me best, but smallest, chicken sandwich I've had. It's expensive to eat here considering the portions.The quality of food is great and you can taste it, but if you've been to Fabarnak, you can appreciate that great food doesn't and shouldn't arrive at an empty wallet. The atmosphere is a bit tight and going at peak hours is dangerous, but the casual and friendly environment makes it better."}
{"text":"Welcome to lunch at my grandmother's; it was the china plates and the light, airy feel to the bar (no my grandmother's kitchen is not a bar but it always felt light and airy and she always served meals on china plates).

I have been meaning to try this place for a long time. I grabbed a group of people and thankfully decided to make a reservation (I was advised you can only make a reservation at lunch times and for tables up to 6 people).

Service was great; coffee fresh and delicious. 

I opted for the burger; so delicious! My OH had the fried chicken thigh sandwich (which was so good he refused our usual 'bite for a bite' rule). 

Dessert; so it is my understanding that they have a chosen dessert...this time it was birthday cake...which as one would expect is served with a candle. I loved it! 

Super busy place; the line up was considerable. They do take out...it is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Went here for some food and drinks. Place is small but nice with a little outside patio. They had a great drink special when we went for a shot a tallboy $9. Had the county burger and chips the burger was tiny but did taste really good! The County chicken is really good to. I would rate a 4/5 but the burger was just way to small I thought it was a slider but overall cool place"}
{"text":"I'm glad all the hipster joints are pretty much in the same area, makes it easier for me to avoid.
Tried their \"famous\" chicken thigh sandwich, it was gross. Not crunchy at all and the sous vide technique doesn't work, chicken tasted like a rubber band. If you're going to stick my chicken in a deep fryer it better come out crispy... Out."}
{"text":"Chicken Thigh Sandwich, is great! All I had here though, it's quite small and $14 is really expensive but I am in hipster doofus central so I guess that's the norm now"}
{"text":"We got here around 11 only because we didn't want to line up at Brioche. The place had a couple people on the patio and a few inside. 
We ordered two Americano's, the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict and the General Burger with Salad. 

We finished our coffees and waited and waited...finally asking her where our meal was and considering no one ordered before or after us it should have been pretty fast.......but no we waited at least 30 minutes.......Finally the young lady brought us our plates and low and behold they were ice cold. We complained because I'm not eating ice cold food and paying them for it.  She took the plates away and returned a short time later....it was a fraction warmer but at this point I was starving so leave the plate. 

Now I started to eat probably the best burger I've ever had in months....can't say my whole life because there are allot of good burgers out there - I'm not kidding this burger was outstanding......The cheese, the sauce and the bun all were deviously delicious !!! Just wonderful. My friend loved her pulled pork eggs benny...it looked amazing and I tasted the pulled pork and it was \"amazeballs\" and I'm sure she will write her own Yelp review. The salad with the burger was dressed with the most delicate dressing that was outstanding! 

I will say the server was nice, but considering at one point we were the only ones in the restaurant they were not very attentive and service was very slow! So....because if that, they loose a star....... 

Will I be back .....100% ......must try other items on the menu !"}

Just a few bites from our full experience.."}
{"text":"My 3 reasons of why I love this place:

1) Damn that fried chicken is good. The presentation and sauces is just spot on. The scotch bell pepper hot sauce is ridiculous on the chicken as well as on anything else. You feel like pilfering a little bottle of it cause it's so good. My only rub is that sometimes the chicken gets sold out before the night is done! 

2) The cocktails and the bartenders. Drinks are fantastic here and the bartenders know their dranks. The creations are lovely and dangerous. Alcoholics, you've been warned!

3) The size. I'm partial to smaller restaurants. I like the feeling of compactness, how can you see what everyone else is eating. The easy-going conversations that are layered over each other.  

I've had lunch and dinner here before, and highly recommend anytime."}
{"text":"Service was great although the price I paid for the miniature chicken sandwich was not great at all. I spent $30 and was still STARVING after. Don't come here if you're hungry. Not to mention I asked for fries with the sandwich not a salad. Food came with a salad, I asked for the fries. When the bill came they charged me for the fries. The drinks looked great though."}
{"text":"Great little spot that offers funky fusion comfort food. Sounds like an oxymoron, but what else would you call buttermilk fried chicken thighs (or pulled pork)  on steamed bao buns with a side of apple slaw (with peanuts & jalapeños)? Besides delicious!
Loved the deep fried cauliflower Poutine!

Cons: limited menu with some great dishes only available for two people. (Oh and it's best if you like bar loud rock music.)

Pros: food is reasonably priced, delicious, and insanely creative.

Additional pro: Ben, the bartender. Super cute, energetic, and sweet!"}
{"text":"County General is our go-to neighbourhood spot (we live around the corner so probably go a little too often). We always sit at the bar where the service is friendly and quick and you can also watch whatever sporting event is going on. 

The food is outstanding! I love how I can add grilled chicken to anything on the menu. The chicken is always fresh and tender. You should try the green beans with it! it's a perfect light dinner and has way more flavour than your moms green beans.  My boyfriend ordered the cornbread add chicken last night and we couldn't believe how friggin good it was."}
{"text":"I went here last night on a \"follow-up-to-a-speed-dating-match\" date.  I chose it because it was close to her work and because she is more into cocktails than beer.

So yeah, let's jump right in with the cocktails, especially that Manhattan.  Advertised as the city's best, I was VERY intrigued since the Manhattan used to be my favourite until I met the Negroni.  I can report that their Manhattan earns itsreputation with me.  I wouldn't regularly pay $18 for a cocktail but if I did, I can only hope it would be as delicious.  

After that I tried their fancy daq and this was also a big hit.  Sweet but not too sweet, complex but not too complex.  Far better than any daiquiri I have ever attempted at home.

And note--the drinks here pack a good punch.  

My date had their special of the day which was kind of like a lemon rickey with tea.  I was highly skeptical but one sip won me over.  Cool and refreshing, perfect for the day's humidity.  

So clearly this place knows what they are doing when it comes to libation.  I'd go again just for that reason.

But then there is the food.  We just had small bites: cornbread, fried green tomatoes and the hard boiled egg.  All of it was incredibly good, original in taste and presentation and left me wanting more.  I really want to come back for a proper brunch of dinner.

Service was great--quick and knowledgeable about the cocktails.  

We sat outside but the inside appeared to be a nice setting.

Very highly recommended, especially on a date where you seek to impress.  Not a good place for groups unless you are just a foursome.  Probably works if you just want to pop into the bar for a drink but this has more of a restaurant feel to it than a bar.  So, if you want to sit, savor and chat with the bartender about their home made bitters, this would be a good place.  If you want to pick up and listen to music, there are other places for you."}
{"text":"I can't remember ever having anything as good as the Okonomiyaki.  It was amazingly good...  I mean really extra \"Ghost Busters\" good.  I also shared the burger which was great.  A fantastic place to take a girl on a date although it is a bit tight and a tad on the cold side but it kept things interesting.
Don't forget to make a reservation."}
{"text":"We had the KFC which was a bit high in price.  $40 - to be shared (2 people).  But the flavours was amazing.  They laid down wax paper.  Placed the chicken on the paper.  Then sprinkles mint, cilantro and pickled onions(so yummy!). Plus an avacado dressing over top.  I would definitely recommend this meal.
We ate outside on the patio.  This was last summer.  (sorry just getting around now to doing the review).  Staff was really great.  Not only were they nice to our dog, but they brought us a dish of water for her."}
{"text":"Really happy that The Country General decided to open up a location here in Riverside neighbourhood. I have never been to the Queen St W location mainly due not having an opportunity so I was looking forward to sampling the menu here with a friend.

The atmosphere can be described as cozy, rustic, charming, and romantic. Probably an ideal place for a first date but that\'92s not why I was there (re: fooood).

Happy hour is M-F from 500pm to 630pm. :-)

The service staff are friendly and they help keep the atmosphere casual and cheerful. The food came out quick but it was paced such that the table was not overwhelmed with your drinks, water, sharing plates, and your mains.

I would recommend the cauliflower poutine (the cauliflower had a great sear on it), the braised lamb shank (combined with the tempura okra) was also a delight, and the hoisin & expresso glazed duck wing had good flavour.

I could definitely see myself coming back again especially if they rotate the menu seasonally."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and really loved the fresh, country, farm theme.  

We sat outside on their new patio/bar where we basically face Shaw St and are inches from folks walking by, but it provided us with lots of people watching opportunities!

Food-wise, we had the Chicken Sandwich, Fish Sandwich of the Day and Cinnamon Limeade.  Everything was delicious, but portions were certainly a tad small.  
-The Chicken Sandwich was wonderful.  Chicken was crispy, moist and well seasoned.  I loved the accouterments from the avocado to the onions to the bun.  Accompanying fries were double-fried and worth the calories, but not truly amazing
-The Fish Sandwich was a seabass.  The fish was nicely seared, but slightly burnt on one side.  It was tasty and I enjoyed the accompanying green salad.  Very fresh: boston bibb lettuce with radishes, chives tossed in an onion vinaigrette.  
-Cinnamon Limade: Deliciously refreshing!  Fresh lime juice with a hint of cinnamon.  Nice sweetness and perfect on a hot summer day!  Not bad for $2.5

I found the service to bad a tad slow.  I sometimes felt forgotten outside, but server was generally pleasant.  

Overall, a super pleasant experience and would totally return!"}
{"text":"The lady had Eggs Benedict with pemeal bacon, she never eats bacon so this was huge, she described the bacon as really tender and not overly salty, all in all the best bacon she's had but as mentioned above she never eats bacon so take it with a grain of salt. However she's a big egg's Benedict  fan and she would describe it as better than Cora's and on par with Stockyards. You can get salad instead of fries, as per pics. 

My whole reason for making the trek down here was for the chicken thigh sandwhich and it was awesome, even better than I had imagined and I was imagining big time. Lightly fried, super tender, super juicy and not overly salty, the avocado, parsley and onions went well. Even the bun tasted different like those sweet Chinese buns, w0ot. The whole meal itself looked small but it filled me up but I tend not to eat too much for lunch. 

We went around 330pm and had troubles getting a seat but I can imagine this place gets super busy, be aware that brunch ends at 4pm and when arriving 330-4pm you get the wtf are you doing treatment, for example only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars cause the waiter was kinda pushing us out due to us being there beyond the brunch time. I guess they clean up and prepare for dinner after 4pm but maybe instead of saying \"so you're done?\" you can say \"anything else I can help you with?\", especially when my rosemary ice tea is 3/4 full (was really good). 

I'd skip the cup cake and venture down Queen W to D'lsih, tried the red velvet and was more like muffin with not much taste unfortunately. 

Anyway I'll definitely be back to try the rest and will try to get there at 3pm to avoid the evil eye!

Pro tip: You get a jug of water when seated and I just kept refilling my rosemary ice tea cause the lemonade was still strong even after diluting with water and it comes with tons of ice. Also free parking on Shaw."}
{"text":"I'd always been curious about this place, and have heard great things about their Korean Fried Chicken and their option of feeding 10-15 people an entire suckling pig. However, stopping in for a late brunch neither of those things were appropriate, and as such I ordered off the regular brunch menu.

I went with the Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich with fries. I'll admit, it was okay but even with the avocado spread was rather lacking in flavour. Their house made dipping sauce that came with the fries (I'm not sure what to call it, as it isn't really spicy enough to be dubbed hot sauce, although at the time of writing this review I'm actually wondering if its the same sauce they use on the KFC) was actually the best tasting part of the meal. I ended up pouring this stuff on the fries and on the sandwich and things at least stepped up their enjoyment. 

Drink menu also underwhelmed a bit. Only 1 beer (Hacker Pschorr) on tap but a few decent bottles and cans ($6-$8) of Ontario craft brews. Cocktails ranging from $12-18.
All in all we had a decent lunch but I likely won't be rushing back unless I gather another 9 people to try that suckling pig on for size."}
{"text":"Iffen yer in the area and needs you some good eats and a cup full o' hooch, git yer ass down to the County General. And by good eats, I mean you order yerself their Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich and stuff that sucker into yer facehole, pronto. The chicken is crispy, lightly spiced, and juicier than a ripe Georgia peach. It comes on a sweet-ish milk bun that's got a generous schmear of \"avocado chutney\" (if yer a common folk like me, I jus' call it guacamole). Hooo-ey! It's damn good.

The portions are smaller than your typical North American chain restaurant conglomerate food trough (so don't come here if you're expecting a burger the size of your head), but the quality of the ingredients and attention to detail make the price well worth it. Service was decent. You're not going to get your ass kissed here, but you'll get everything you need in a timely fashion. 

Also dug the cocktail menu here. None of that fancy high falootin' appletinis that the cityfolk drink. Nosirree. Here, you'll find mainly whiskeys and rums, in all types of qualities. Go on a \"flight night,\" like I did, and sample a bunch. There's wines and beer, but... don't be a wuss. Grow a set and drink like a man. 

I'd visit County General again in two shakes of a lamb's tail. You should get your boots scootin' and head there yourself."}
{"text":"3.5/5

This place was decent... I came here in hopes of trying some of the best fried chicken I've had in my life - but actually came up pretty disappointed. Their fried chicken lacked any crisp at all, and was a little on the dry side. However, the sauces that accompanied it were so good that it almost made up for it. The dish came with gochujang, hoisin espresso BBQ, and avocado sauces, and was garnished with toasted sesame and pickled onions. Steamed buns came on the side to scoop up whatever sauce you had left over.

We ordered the fried chicken portion for one ($20) along with the south of the border county ribs portion for one ($22), and had the crispy pig ears ($7) to start.

The crispy pig ears were a great appetizer. They came in thin strips, almost like shoestring fries. It was tossed in maple syrup and came with a spicy mayo/remoulade sauce. Chewy and tasty.

The ribs were also good. The meat was so tender and could barely cling to the bone. We got 6 small ribs, accompanied by sweet potato puree and plantain chips, again, to scoop up the remaining sauce.

For drinks, we had the loose lips lager ($8) and the Shiny vegan cider ($7). They had a long list of drinks including craft beers, cocktails, and wines.

The County General is a place with a more compact menu, but they definitely excel in the dishes they do. I enjoyed the Asian influences, from the gochujang to the steamed buns and hoisin sauce. It was a decent fusion, although I wasn't that big a fan of their take on Korean Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"Monday Brunch!?  amazing.

Nice place, great atmosphere, great service.
Had the 3 course Monday Bourbon Brunch for $20.

1. Bourbon Caesar - cool twist. proper size. I'd like to see the clamato a little spicier, but the awesome spice mix on the rim made up for it. 

2. Wild Turkey Eggs Benedict, Brown Butter Béarnaise, Smoked Bourbon Peameal - eggs a little undercooked and sauce a little heavy on the butter but still delicious.  Beans as a side was a nice touch, and lots of flavour.

3. Espresso Panna Cotta w/ house donut and (preserved peaches?)
-panna cotta was one of the best i've had.  not overly gelatinous, soft texture almost like a mousse. lots of espresso flavour, and you could see the espresso grinds settled on the bottom, so you know it's from scratch.  Also a nice small piece, not a tall mound like you see sometimes.
-Donut was great, chewy deep fried, and hearty with lots of flavour. also not too sweet.
-fruit went really well, and the three together was a killer mouthful."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. I ordered the steak and eggs, the waitress yanked the menu out from under my arm, without asking me how I would like my steak and eggs. When I did ask, she launched into a long explanation about it's up to the chef to decide... Gimme a break, it's not like I'm at 5 star French restaurant!!! Anyhow, after the explanation she asked how I wanted them. 
She could've just spared the explanation.  

I got my food the way I wanted it, and it was very good. There was only 1 egg with my steak and eggs, but it was a good one. 
There was a lovely arugula salad, and a red pepper sauce that was perfect with the rare steak. Delicious meal, but prepare for typical hipster server attitude 'I shouldn't be here serving you, I'm busy planning my next tat.'"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Brunch
Specialty: Farmer Inspired - Seasonal Cooking 
Menu items: Croque Madame, Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich & Eggs Benedict

The County General lives up to the all the buzz and talk you've all been hearing. Its a tiny restaurant located in a big city, serving farmer inspired dishes, with a rustic decor and plating and a fantastic menu.
For all brunch lovers out there, looking for a homey breakfast done right, using fresh ingredients, The County General is the place to be at. As the weather warms in this rather cold city, I long for those warm Sundays where the act of \"brunching\" becomes a fundamental part of one's weekend.

I would describe brunch at The County General as tasty and comforting with a \"farmy\" feel to it. Their Croque Madame is certainly representative of that and a crowd pleaser with a decadent cheese melting conception.
The Croque Madame is simply a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with a twist. The twist being the soft béchamel sauce, the use of hand crafted specialty cheeses and the added element of a fresh sunny side-up egg.
Served with your choice of french fries or salad, this sandwich is melted ooey-gooey goodness on a hard-wood cutting tray.

Although sandwiches seem to be what drives the Toronto crowds to the County General, it seems their big hit, whether for brunch, lunch or dinner is still the infamous Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich.
This sandwich has been praised and talked about all over the city, and its popularity does match its taste. I mean, who would have thought of taking tender pieces of chicken thighs (which in my mind are the best part of a chicken), soaking them in buttermilk, then frying them to perfection and assembling in a mix of avocado chutney, pickled red onions and coriander (aka cilantro), on a milk bun...truly mouth-watering.
The way to eat this sandwich is by squeezing the top bun down until the master piece is bite-able, and then sinking your teeth into what 's about to become a great brunching experience.

Last but not least, I would like to give an honorary mention to County General's Eggs Benny.
Although I can attest I have had better eggs benny experiences, such as the one from the already closed Hoof Cafe (thanks for ruining me for life btw); I would say CG's Eggs Benedict are quite good and worth the try. They tend to be more rustic and dry than your typical benny, but the hollandaise is quite fresh and tasty and the eggs are done just right. So if you are a Benedict fan, you would not go wrong with these.

As a parting thought, I would also like to give a mention to CG's coffee. I had one of the best cappuccinos there. Their coffee is done to perfection and the milk is frothy and fresh. So much so, that I even doubled on my coffee order that day!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"I'd probably give this place a 3.5 if I could. My friend and I decided to grab brunch here on Canada Day. We were probably there at 11:30am, about half an hour from when they opened (holiday hours), they usually open at 10am I believe. It was not too overly crowded/packed. 

I ordered the Chicken Thigh Burger ($14) with avocado chutney, pickled red onion and cilantro. This comes with a side option of salad or soup. I decided on the soup, which was squash (I LOVE squash). I tried it first and found it hot, tasty, smooth and just a bit spicy. Pretty yummy. However, I thought the chicken thigh burger was just good, not great. Bread was slightly toasted as a nice touch though. 

Meanwhile, my friend ordered the Pulled Pork Eggs Benny ($14) with smoked pork, 2 poached eggs, cornbread and hollandaise. It looked really yummy and my friend said the pork was very tender but I'm surprised that it didn't come with any fries or side dish. A bit pricy considering other places will give you a side usually with your eggs benny. 

Overall, I did have a nice brunch here. Food was good and staff was polite and cordial. Wait time for our food was pretty long though and probably why I took a star off. Like it was long enough that we both were wondering if they forgot our order. Weird since place wasn't packed. Not sure if it was because of my soup? If I'm ever in the area, maybe I'll go back for the dinner dishes? See if my experience will be better."}
{"text":"The service was decent drinks came slow but the waiter was beautiful. Ribs were extremely but the BBQ sauce lacked smoke and that pungent spice that should accompany it, the chicken thigh sandwich was extremely greasy could not eat it, the fries where outstanding though with the homemade ketchup, the summer corn salad also was over dressed and lacklustre"}
{"text":"Nice chill place. Dont advise on large groups going because the place is tight. Food options are limited. Had the county burger which was delicious. Good drink menu. Definitely more of a drink place. Patio is tiny but chill."}
{"text":"Great Cuban music, comfy ambience, DELICIOUS chicken sandwich with tropical zing, fresh local produce in the crunchy salad, house made ketchup with tang that made me eat ALL of my mother-in-law's fries. Adorable and efficient waitress, talented bartender. Great cocktails! Mocktails too! Great outdoor bar with a miniature forest along Shaw street. Surprisingly comfortable, sturdy wooden chairs and benches. Stumbled on it by accident, and grateful we did!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend ate here about two weeks ago. here's the play by play. (spoiler alert, I wouldn't go back) 

- Enjoyed our server, found him to be very nice and attentive to us. 

- the Caesar was quite tasty my girlfriend had, nothing special though. But my specialty drink was sub par. 
The Sunday Picnic 12
El Dorado 5yr Rum, Averna
Cinnamon, Vanilla & Root Beer. 

-found there to be to much vanilla, over taking the other flavors. which is disappointing considering this is one of their \"specialty\" drinks. 

- as for our food. I ordered two \"bites\", the \"pork bun\" \"little mac\" was very tender but lacking in flavor. frankly the bun they had used was the best part. The \"Devilled egg\" with crispy chicken skin on top was by far my favorite thing I ordered, very good, just exploding with flavors. 

- as for our main meals I had the \"Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich\" since that is what they are known for. Again disappointed found it to be VERY salty all I could taste was the salt (and I personally much rather something salty than sweet), same goes with their fries. salt,salt,salt by the end of my meal my lips hurt. 

-Unfortunately My girlfriend didn't fair much better. Ordered the wings but turns out they had just switched them to \"duck wings\" they just hadn't had the chance to fix the menu. She still ordered them, our server said they had sold out of them the past two nights. High expectations were just slapped onto that order right then and there. *drum roll* 

low and behold, salty... and to top it off their was a feather cooked into the batter, pulled it out no biggie. Now I did enjoy the flavor of them, once getting past the salt rock of a batter they make. Sadly though we were interrupted half way through our meal by a few hungry wasps who had made landing on the duck wings. which made for an early exit at the County General. 

all in all. wouldn't go back. There are far to many other great places in the city to try out than give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Food and service always good! A little disappointed they took omelettes off the menu. They once had a kimchi omelette special that was great. As a substitution I got the shanghai scrambler, which was also good. Portion sizes are nice, but can be a bit expensive. Sounds odd, but I really like the side salad! Good dressing."}
{"text":"Brunch Menu Review
My husband, our friend and I came here around 3:00pm for a late lunch. After hearing good things about the fried chicken, my husband and our friend ordered the chicken thigh sandwich. Both stated that the chicken was completely bland - no salt or spices at all. They each ordered a sauce to spread on the chicken because they literally said it was tasteless. 

They were out of south of the border, so I ordered the Huevos Mexicana. It was like breakfast nachos, but instead of piling the ingredients on top of the chips, there were two squirts of avocado something and some refried beans which were, you guessed it, flavorless.  

The good thing about this place was definitely their service and their fresh squeezed juices. All in all, disappointed. Will not return."}
{"text":"Worst brunch ever!!!! We've gone to this restaurant for dinner on two occasions and enjoyed the meal.  What a mistake trying it for brunch - the \"French toast\" was ONE slice of Wonderbread dipped in egg and some sour cabbage filler on the side - hardly a good pair to start with let alone leaving you starving afterward.  In a city full of artisan bakeries with amazing bread options they use chemical prepackaged white bread - worse than most cheap diners I've been to.  And, the pancake was literally ONE pancake.  With two beverages our bill was over $50 and we were left wholly unsatisfied.  TAKE A PASS ON THIS ONE."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for brunch and was not disappointed!  Had the mushroom and leek omelet and shared the cheddar scones with sage butter and the chocolate chip pancake with banana and caramel sauce.  Now my omelet was good..I am not much of an egg person but every once in awhile I get a craving.  So I fulfilled it here.  But oh..my...god....the scones were delish!  Light and airy and oh so cheddar-y!  But the hit of the brunch for me was the pancake.  This is no ordinary chocolate chip pancake.  First of all I think the name is a bit misleading...there really isn't any chocolate chips..all the chocolate is inside the pancake, but it is done wonderfully so it is not that annoyingly sweet taste.  The bananas with the sauce just make it divine!  The scones and pancake are more like sides to a dish - not a main meal...however next time I might just order those dishes as my main. They were definitely better thanb my omelet.

This place does not take resos for brunch and they get packed.  If you are not there by 11am, well then aim for coming around 12:30pm.  Service was amazing - from the time I called to inquire about resos (the woman on the phone was so pleasant and asked me how my day was going!  Who does that?!).  Our server was really nice...my friend had to send something back b/c it looked a little under done and they were quite happy to re-do the order to the way she liked it.  No attitude or anything at all.  Amazing!  Will definitely come back and try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday, and we had arranged for the roast pig.  While we were waiting for the pig we warmed up with bourbon and watermelon lemonade, which was awesome.  We had some appetizers as well, including coleslaw and corn bread.  Then the main event arrived, a whole pig slow roasted.  It was so good, tender and juicy, and we had 5 different sauces to dip in.  Really enjoyed the whole experience, though ours wasn't typical in that the roast pig is a special order you have to place well in advance.  I scanned the menu and lots of good southern influenced items on it.  Funky atmosphere with indie rock pounding out, so if you're looking for quiet ambience this is not the place.  Well stocked bar and small patio.  Props to Carlo the owner and Aaron the bartender for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday during the long weekend -- no line ups at 10:30 AM, so easily, our party of five dined peacefully.  There were a couple burger orders -- well done meat seemed to be the choice of my dining companions, and they enjoyed it tremendously.  The fries were fine.  I had the fried chicken thigh burger with fries.  It was delicious.  The kid had the chorizo pizza pocket with a sunny side egg on top and it was a VERY big success!  For drinks, I had the cinnamon limeade -- tart and refreshing way to start the day.  Very enjoyable meal.  Service was with a smile.  Can't complain."}
{"text":"I had been biking by the former OddFellows waiting patiently to see what would replace it.  The anticipation has paid off in spades with County General.

We arrived after the lunch crowd to find ourselves seated quickly by the friendly staff.

Originally, I had planned to go here for brunch. After reading all the reviews, i am really happy I didn't!  We were, at times, the only people sitting in there.

I tried their Fried Chicken Thigh sandwich.  Um...yummy and amazing! I devoured this sandwich. It suffered an immediate death upon its arrival in front of me. A flavorful and juicy fried chicken made with a  layer of this refreshing and surprising avocado chutney with red onions and cilantro.  All this nestled between a milk bun. 
Sure, it is an awkward shape but easily solved to eat by cutting in half and spearing it with the little stick it comes with

This was served with its salted house fries and in house made ketchup.  Heavenly.

The chef told us this fabulous factoid, they only use locally sourced and in season products makes this a real gem. It was really nice of him to come by and chat on top of clearing our plates.  Crazy, huh? But awesome.

We tried a couple of their desserts: a chocolate cupcake(a salted caramel center) with butter cream icing and double chocolate cookie. Please try it. It tastes home baked.  

The decor echoes a modern farmhouse. Check out the photos and you will see what I mean. Cozy and queen west chic.

Portions and pricing.  A lot  of debate on this one but as far as my lunch experience is concerned thoroughly satisfied. I left that meal with a real smile.  I felt I got a lot more than what I paid for."}
{"text":"Pros: 
- The pairing of food and ingredients are pretty unique and creative
-Must try the crispy pig ears! Sweet mixed with savoy. The sriracha mayo gave it a nice kick. Amazing pairing of flavours!
- Fried chicken sandwich was crispy and avocado gave it creamy taste
- French toast wasn't bad. Really tasted the egg
- The sausage on the eggs benedict was flavoured well  

Cons:
- Portions of food is small for the price we paid. Still felt hungry after my meal! Definitely wasn't a bang for my buck.
- The Duck Confit Cassoulet was a disappointment. The duck was dry and the maple bacon beans didn't have much flavour (though, I am not really a fan of beans). The poached egg was really the only thing I liked
- Arnold Palmer drink is a mix of ice tea and lemonade. This was very sour.
- Disappointed that I was mislead about wait time. The four of us got there at 11:30am for brunch. The waitress told us it would be a half an hour wait, but it ended up being an 1 hour and 15 minutes! The waitress did get my number so that she could call us when the table was ready, but I wished they gave us more of an accurate range of wait time. There are no reservations for Sunday brunch. 
Another thing, this place is not good for large groups. They only have 2 tables for 4 people and the rest is pretty much 2 seaters.

I noticed that some of their items change weekly so it may worth another try, but this is a toss up - unique food, but not worth the price....hm...."}
{"text":"Love the burgers here, unfortunately the last time we went we were never given the opportunity to order food. We were passed the menu, and told to sit where we liked so we choose the bar. After ordering drinks, I held the menu and made eyes with the waitress, who never thought to actually take or order. Too bad, I really wanted a burger. We left after 30 min."}
{"text":"While walking Queen West on a Thursday evening, we decided to stop in for a beer. Atmosphere was very cosy, music was great (a little loud). And it turned out food was great. 
My date had Mussels w/ Chorizo and I had County Burger with a simple but delicious green side salad. Very good. 
Definitely worthy of a return visit. 
Cheers"}
{"text":"The food is some of the best I've ever had. They have happy hour specials on drinks ($3 beers until 630pm) 

Wait staff are friendly and very knowledgeable about the food. 

Don't be afraid of the pinkish looking fried chicken in the sandwich - it's done (they had to explain to me that it was cooked sous vide). And I was able to get it without cilantro! Perfectly juicy and crispy, and the salad was a great complement. 

Dim and cozy ambience - I was stuffed and will definitely need to come back for dessert."}
{"text":"I came to the County General on a late Thursday night dinner and found the place mostly empty. The restaurant is set up in a long almost-alleyway space with most of the tables clustered near the entrance and a bunch of seats along the bar. The music was loud and pounding but the servers were friendly and service is quick. 

I had the curried cauliflower salad with additional fried chicken. It was surprisingly good, the bulgur was mixed with these little black dried berries that lent a fragrant crunch and strange fruitiness to the dish. Turned out they were caraway seeds that had been treated to give a sweet and sour taste. It was a good salad, slightly more greasy due to the fried chicken and the herb oil but still interesting. An extra star for their ability to serve me something I haven't seen before."}
{"text":"I hate to give such a terrible review because I live in Riverside and I am all about supporting the local businesses, but this place needs to know (if you are reading) that your food is absolutely horrible. The chicken thigh sandwich barely has any meat and the meat that is in there tastes gross. It looks undercooked, yes I know it is cooked sous-vide, but it is still undercooked. The eggs benny are nasty and the prices for each of these are $14. Also, they put peanuts in their salad... why not walnuts? Is it because peanuts are cheap and you put them out with your beers for clients? 

It is cute and cozy inside, but PLEASE improve your menu. I so desperately wanted to like this place, but can't say that I do."}
{"text":"I really want to give it a 3.5 star but we're restricted here on yelp. 

Stopped in for a quick dinner last night by the bar. There were couples who were dining there, there were short queues for the tables (30-60 minutes depending how big your party is).

We all know it's a small place. They are well-staffed, it took them quite a while to get my drink order. I started with their bourbon figgy dew. I haven't had a good cocktail in a long time in the city. This is one of my new favs!

Yes, like other reviews, the portions tend to be on the small side. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, slaw, and fries. I really didn't need the fries, since I ordered the cocktail. The gentlemen next to me said he could have ordered another sandwich, but he wants to finish his beer instead. 

Fries were blah, wish the portion was bigger and not served in a glass or just have better fries for goodness sake! Ketchup was different. It was organic? Or was it just sweeter and less heavy as Heinz?

I enjoyed the chicken sandwich, but I know I have friennds who would not like it because there's cilantro in the toppings. The chicken is yummy, but I had to spit out some small pieces of bone or ligaments.

Slaw was good and refreshing. Right amount of oil and vinegar and a bit of heat in the seasoning. 

Nobody was waiting for my seat, but i felt rushed since the waitress kept asking me if I was finished with my sandwich when clearly there was a big piece left and I never finished my fries. Did she want to finish my fries or something? She could have asked, I would have given it to her. Shrug."}
{"text":"I'd been to the County General before and was impressed, but I really wanted to come back and try their much-lauded hamburger. My dining companion and I rolled into the joint at around noon on a Saturday and, after a five minute wait, were directed to two spots at the bar.

Our server immediately poured us some water and asked if we'd like anything else to drink. I was fine with water, but my dining companion asked for a Sprite. The server apologetically said that there was no Sprite to be had but that he could make him a Limeaid. The drink received, my dining companion couldn't stop raving about the beverage. I'll have to sample it next time.

We both subsequently ordered the hamburger. I asked for a side salad and my dining companion went with fries. 20 minutes later the burgers made their appearance. I started with the salad and was immediately impressed. A mixture of lettuce, onions, and thinly sliced radishes, the salad was perfection. The dressing was almost addictive, and I was sad to finish it.

The burger, on the other hand, was a bit of a letdown. The meat itself was way above average. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and it didn't have any unnecessary crap mixed in. The problem was the horseradish spread. It was simply overpowering, with the heavy vinegar taste obliterating any and all other flavors. I remarked that it tasted like a horseradish sandwich with a little meat in it. A huge disappointment.

I'd order the burger again, certainly, but next time I'd ask for all the condiments on the side. Oh, and my dining companion's fries were very much better than usual."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the food, service and drinks are excellent.  The burger is one of the best in the city.

The only thing that holds it back from getting five stars is there is a ventilation issue.  You end up smelling like a fryer the rest of the night so it's not a good place to go if you are heading somewhere else after dinner.  If so bring some fabreeze with you.  Sometimes it's more intense than others but suppose it has to do with how much fried chicken is ordered.

The food is so good that it's worth it but hope they can get that sorted out."}
{"text":"Worst dinner of 2015. Pork buns were lackluster tiny and mediocre. Veggie oka-whatever was ok- could have lived without it. No poutine or tuna available on a Saturday go figure. So we'll take the duck wing.. Basic teriyaki sauce on a dark meat wing woop dee doo. For the main course we had the fried chicken. The waiter brings out some wax paper on the table like its some glamorous presentation. Out comes 3 tiny pieces of kfc and a few bottles of sauce. $30 later i want to shoot myself. We split a few burgers- who the hell splits burgers? At least this was decent so I enjoyed my 6 bites. Save room for dessert? Good this place serves a peanut butter brick covered in crap cream and some tiny garbage cookies. $200 down the drain. Yelp please create a 0 star option!"}
{"text":"The place was great, our server was super friendly. I got the thigh fried chicken sandwich and added bacon. I enjoyed it. The fried chicken wasn't too greasy and the sandwich had a lot of flavor. The fries very cooked to perfection, golden brown and crispy! Must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The County General is so good, I still get flashbacks of my meals there. It's like having dinner at your grandmother's cottage with inventive ingredients and perfect flavours. 

For starters, it's a great brunch spot. Anywhere in Toronto where brunch is served well, you can bet it's pretty darn good. Be prepared to wait for brunch, sometimes for lunch and dinner. Be sure to ignore the overworked servers, the screaming babies, the loud music, the overdressed hipsters and anyone else who is huffing and puffing for the line. It's definitely worth it. 

My favourite brunch item (which they no longer have, likely because it was seasonal and winter) is the pork belly hash. Perfectly flavoured, right moist taste with the potatoes and served with their homemade ketchup. Second best item is the famous buttermilk chicken thigh sandwich. The avocado chutney is perfect on that sandwich. A warning though on their eggs benny, the peameal is smoked and can be a bit dry, which might not suit everyone's tastebuds. 

Also, to note:
BEST ROASTED BONE MARROW in a NON-FRENCH RESTAURANT!

Definitely check it out during Happy Hour, along with the pork belly trio and bun. What they are trying to do at County General is akin to a Momofuku take on flavour pairing, especially with pork. 

As much as I love their menu, the tacos are not the best, so stick to your hearty protein plates and enjoy the plentiful alcohol selection. I would recommend the limeade in a Toronto heat, and ask for a warm rummy apple cider if it's chilly outside. Sailor Jerry is ok on its own, but I would recommend digging into their great selection of Rum & Bourbon for a real treat. 

On a parting note, the coffee is served in a really cute cup, just the way it would be served at home."}
{"text":"Casual, rustic themed restaurant on Queen West.  Despite the name and a southern home cooking feel, the menu had some asian inspiration (pork buns, crispy won ton).  The food was tasty but the portions were definitely on the small side ($5 for a single 'bite' pork bun was a little much).

Interesting burbon selection too"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio which overlooked the sidewalk, kind of cool. The menu does not have many options to choose from. Our waiter was very nice. I split the deviled egg with my friend and it was honestly the best deviled egg I've ever had in my life. It was garnished with fried chicken skin which was so tasty. I had the chicken thigh sandwich which was just okay. I could not have the guacamole it was served with due to a food intolerance and I had asked the server if it could be replaced with another sauce. Unfortunately, they did not replace it with anything else so the sandwich was a bit plain. I'm sure that it's normally quite good though."}
{"text":"I met up with two friends here tonight. It's a small place, and only has a few tables. So we had to wait a little bit before getting a table. They ended up not being able to pull two tables together to seat 3, so they did the next best thing--turn the table so there's enough space for two people to sit on one side. I didn't mind this one bit, just glad we got a table and didn't have to wait too long.

We ordered the chicken liver with smoked bread for apetizer, the two-way fried chicken, two sides (egg gratin and some veggies)...had some beer with that, and then a cake that consisted of mutiple layers of things (chocolate, vanilla, ganache, salted caramel, and \"other goodness\"). I really enjoyed everything we had. I think we could have easily ordered one or two more things and I would have happily eaten all of it =)  Definitely get the fried chicken though. It is supposed to be eaten with our hands, and so they served it _on_ the table instead of on a plate. It's been a while since I've eaten like this and then be able to lick my fingers afterwards!

I would definitely come here again. I would give this an overall rating of either a 4.5 or a 5. I'm rather surprised at some of the lower scores it's received so far."}
{"text":"We have been to County for a sit down dinner, and taken a picnic basket to the park. The food is good, tasty, but not world shattering. The chicken sandwich is my go to. In the summer, check out the patio, it's amazing! 
All in all, this is a good dining experience."}
{"text":"On my second time there, the first time was so long ago I forgot, I remembered that the food was good, but also that it is wayyy overpriced. They're duck confrit pancake is ok, but nothing special and you pay $6!!!, for one small-medium sized pancake, and my girlfriend's chicken sandwich with salad, average sized and ok in her opinion was $14. And the coffee, although very good, is a whopping $3.50 for a very small cup, and you get no break on refills. Yikes! There are tons of other places to go folks, that serve great food, even better, without soaking patrons like this spot."}
{"text":"The Calamari wraps were amazing. Not chewy, perfectly done. The fries they have are very tasty, the ketchup is slightly sweet with a hint of apple, and the restaurant looks very nice. We never had to ask for more water once, and the staff were very attentive. Definitely a great place to try. Very good and not that expensive."}
{"text":"Great drink options & bartending. Only had the burger, mainly drinks. Great service, sat at bar. Def recommend this spot. Good walking area. Parked on side street."}
{"text":"Great little joint! Food was really good for the price point. Service was great as well. Tired the chicken sandwich and the curried cauliflower salad. I see why it made it to toronto's top 100. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Who knew Brussel Sprouts could taste this good?
I've gotta say, this is my ideal restaurant experience. Healthy, delicious food made with high quality ingredients. I loved the food and the service here. I had the Falafel burger, with side salad. It was amazing!!! My date had the Pork Schnitzel and he liked it a lot too.But the highlight of the meal were the brussel sprouts. Mouth-watering. This is a joint you want to frequent on the regular."}
{"text":"I walked in with a friend and we were met with an idiotic comment by the waiter: \"Do you need help?\" I responded by saying that we were there to have supper! 
We took a seat and ordered the overpriced 20$ county chicken with $7 fries. $20 for a Bland HALF chicken!!! Wtf

The chicken was dusted with bits of what looked like chicken feed! These bits were chewy and stale! The leg piece was pink and bloody near the bone! 
When I notified the waiter of the raw bloody appearance of the chicken leg, he was dismissive and said it was perfectly safe to consume!   He added further that in California they serve raw chicken!!! I came for fried chicken and not for his foolish rant on raw chicken consumption in Cali!!!! If that is his justification for serving me disgustingly bloody chicken, then he needs to learn common sense!!! Bloody bastard! 

Chicken was also severely under-seasoned! Bland! 

Customer service was comatose! (Absent customer service!)

Save your precious money and avoid this place! The chicken is bland and bloody! Disgusting and regrettable experience!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper tonight at The County General (Queen W/Shaw).It's the first time I've been there.

We got there about 6:30 and had to wait about a half hour for a seat ... so we were told to sit by the window (we sat on the window sill and had a glass of bubbly Riesling).

Two seats opened at the bar and they were ours ... the place was jammed.

I ordered the 6oz County Burger and Gord ordered the Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich.  He said his sandwich was really good.  My burger was juicy and delicious!

The ketchup for the fries was made there ... it had a bite to it and you could really taste cinnamon.

The food is good and there's definitely a vibe. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Note: this is a delayed review as I have eaten here weeks ago. Also should mention I have eaten here in it's former guise Oddfellows and really enjoyed the communal table concept and sad to see it go

Brunch (for which there is a wait if you come as more than 2 people)
First the atmosphere: consisted mostly of young professionals, but the slightly alternative vintage bike crowd. Amazing soundtrack. Heard 3 Smiths songs, which always gets me excited. In fact, that might have skewed my impression of the meal. 

Service: Not memorable but not bad (sat at bar) .

Food: Had the Croque Madame with two pints Muskoka Brewery Mad Tom IPA (yes, for brunch, which is why I don't remember what the side was). The sandwich was great, definitely very tasty, served at the right temperature and very satisfying after my morning game of squash. I personally prefer gruyere for melting, but this cheese (bechamel) worked very well as well.


Dinner (not so much wait)
Atmosphere: again, young professionals, this time in blazers or even full-on suits. Music not as memorable (though still good) and a little loud for a casual conversation.

Service: again, not memorable.

Food: Started with the roasted bone marrow (something I have not had in years) which was very pleasing. Nicely prepared, easily spreadable. Definitely got the appetite going. Had the fried chicken thigh sandwich. Amazing. Not oily or greasy at all. Light and crispy batter. Properly cooked and still tender. Very good quality bird. A bit on the small side though. Both me and friend definitely walked away not entirely satisfied (in fact, we went to Hawker Bar immediately afterwards for more snacks).

Solid overall place. Would return for the brunch primarily."}
{"text":"Came back here late one evening for fries and booze. I was initially disappointed that the figgy dew had been taken off the menu, but recovered as we made our way through several other cocktails. Man, these guys pour a smooth drink! They always seem to include a \"blammo!\" ingredient, but just enough to keep the beverage interesting. 

It was late one Saturday night - the place was full, but not crowded. Good for tipsy conversations and late-night snacks."}
{"text":"Every single thing in the menu is good. Burger and chicken thigh sandwich are my go to. Usually split the fries and a county salad. The homemade ketchup is amazing. Service is super 'cheersy' in that they get to know you quick and they treat you like a local. If you have the time, absolutely do the county friend chicken for two. What an amazing display!"}
{"text":"I was here with my friend for brunch. We were there around 1:30 so it wasn't very busy. My friend loves this place and he always orders Eggs Benedict (one of their popular dishes for brunch). The decoration is funky but creative; the atmosphere is warm and fun. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. 

Limited choices on the menu for brunch and soft beverages (pops and juices). But for those who love alcohols, they have a variety of cocktails, and local beers. 

I ordered Croque Madame. It's basically just pulled pork and cheese (lots of cheese) filled in toasted breads, and salad on the side. The food presentation is unique and creative. I love their salad but just not a fan of their pickle onions ( i have mild allergy to onions). The pulled pork was amazing but I couldn't finish my dish because it was too cheesy for me (less cheese next time). My friend ordered extra crispy bacon with maple syrup on top and it was pretty tasty!

I was confused when it came to choosing drink. Their celery soda got my attention. I was scared to order it, but the staff said it's one of her favourites so why not. It was basically just fresh squeezed celery with hint of lemon. I didn't regret order the drink and I would like to say thank you to the staff. The drink was very refreshing and it really cooled me down during that hot day.

The food was decent and was reasonable priced."}
{"text":"I went here last week with a foodie friend. 

VIBE: This place, which was the old Oddfellows, really does feel like a farmhouse: wood encompasses the interiors and there's a very cool collage of photos representing Cumbrae farms, where County General sources their meat. And with good reason: almost everything is house made, including the ketchup. We went on a dreary Monday night at around 6 p.m. and were able to get the seat near the window. Looking out at the bus stop of the corner of Queen and Shaw provides endless entertainment. The clientele are casual and relaxed whether it's friends having dinner or a father and son bonding over soup. Service is also casual (yet professional) and very friendly. 

WHAT WE ATE: We split the pork belly and  steamed buns (with Kim Chi, Avocado Chutney, Green Apple Slaw) and the famous fried chicken thigh sandwich. 

The pork belly was cooked to perfection but I felt it lacked a bit of flavour; the sauces made up for it however. The buns were moist and fresh. I think it's a fair price for $10. 

The thigh sandwich was delectable! Cooked sous-vide, it didn't taste \"fried\" at all and the buttermilk enabled it to retain its flavour. The avocado was a nice surprise and so fresh, I wouldn't be surprised if it came right from the market. DAMN! That said, $14 was a bit pricey for its size. However, it's a worthy splurge and one of those Toronto cravings I know I'll have in the future.  The accompaniment of fries (served in a glass) was a nice side but a bit of a weird spice for me. That said, they were still pretty tasty but it reminded me of the fries from Weber's hamburger place on Highway 11. Weber's fries have the best spice and in comparison, CG's version was a bit off mark. 

NOTE: the sandwich is kind of awkward looking; you'll also look awkward eating it. So my advice is to get it cut in half. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK: I'll be \"counting\" on returning to County General soon! YES SIR!"}
{"text":"Great service. Sitting at the bar with the tastiest ceasar I've ever had - none of that mott's crap!! Busy and small place but great staff - the chef heard we wanted to try the pigs head and came out to personally tell us he would have some made if we wait 30 mins. We ordered it and a burger and the mussels for 1 (lemongrass broth). Highly recommend as a casual dinner date that doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Tasty food, friendly service, great Caesars and classic rock. This place is a consistent and reliable choice."}
{"text":"I've only had dinner here, though multiple times... including 'late night'.

The music here, from what I can tell, is always fantastic. Their playlists contain a stellar collection of multiple genres so anybody you go with should be happy.

The service is great - I've had the same server a few times. She's super laid back, pays attention to details and doesn't waste any time lingering about. She's in when you need her, and out when you don't.

The food is mostly good, a *bit* bland and I can't help but notice that the portions aren't great which then makes me feel like it's a bit overpriced. IE my Cesar salad w/ bacon didn't even have a full strip worth of bacon.  

Also, I was disappointed by the desert after deciding to treat myself. I didn't bother ordering any on consequent visits.

The room is really nice, cozy and has a good warm vibe - it is narrow but that's probably more of a problem for the servers and shouldn't have any reflection on your experience unless you've got some pretty severe diagnosed claustrophobia."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My fiance and I go here whenever we are in the neighbourhood.  So far everything I've had I've liked.  In particular, I love the cauliflower pakora burger and the kale salad with cripsy capers.  It's a definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"The most satisfying meals I have ever had! It's a kind of meal when you have a smile on your face 2 hrs after..I Salute thee County General for having items on the menu like South of the Equator ($12) which consisted of the best corn bread I have ever tasted, poached eggs, and toasted Plantains, my friend ordered the Huevos Mexicana ($14) which consisted of scrambled eggs, salsa, guacamole, and best tortilla chips on this side of the border...

The vibe is cool, the food is rich, the music is bumping and the beat is thumping!!! The best place to bring ones out of towner friends and show them what Queen West is ALL about!!"}
{"text":"1) chicken for 2 more like chicken for 4
2) food is great, chicken delicious, flavours work well, not over spiced, not heavy handed with the sauce, sweet buns are boss, pickled onion is pickled right and saw a waitress walking over a sick looking burger with a beautiful runny fried egg on it
3) they make good drinks, like really good drinks"}
{"text":"Great bourbon selection and good cocktail happy hour deals during the week. Seats are a bit limited so call ahead for reservation. Food is decent but I really only come for the Fried Thigh Sandwich.. damn good. They changed the menu very recently and going towards family style.. Luckily for me, they added a fried chicken platter so naturally, I was happy. A bit on the pricey side, but I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Decided to check out The County General for brunch the other day, as my goal is to check out new places on the regular, instead of always gravitating towards our old faithfuls :) This place is definitely cool and hipster on the inside but you can tell it's just newly opened, as they are still ironing out the details of running a new restaurant, waitstaff and kitchen in general. But that's what to expect when checking out a new spot during the first few months. 

The menu for brunch was decent, but feel it would be better with more non-pork options for us non-pork eaters :), but it was still good nonetheless. I opted for an early grey tea (which they had run out of so I had orange pekoe instead) and the fried chicken thigh sandwich, while my friend chose a latte and the french omelet. It took quite a while for our server to take our order, and the girls sitting next to us who had come in about 15 minutes later, received their food 20 minutes before we did (hence, the ironing out details of a new resto). But our server was really nice and pleasant and super accomodating. 

The omelet was nice, but had something missing - it was a bit on the plain side, only with herbs (this was one of the few options for my non-pork eating friend :). My fried chicken thigh sandwich was tasty, the chicken cooked perfectly. The bun was quite small, but was exceptionally fresh and homemade. Both came with either a side of salad or fries. I chose the salad (The salad was lovely and fresh, and I loved the seasonal local ingredients), while my friend had mentally opted for the fries, which she forgot to mention to our server. He brought hers out with salad, however when she mentioned wanting the fries instead to him, without hesitation, he brought her a fresh order of fries and left her salad as well, which was very nice of him (proper etiquette, however a lot of restaurants seem to forget this small detail!). The fries were dee-lish, and all in all it was a good experience in a cool venue. It doesn't make it to my list of fave brunch spots in the city, but I definitely wouldn't steer someone away as it was quite decent and worth checking out if in the neighbourhood. I'll definitely have to go back for dinner as it looks quite enticing :)"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and it really reminds you of a 50's lunch counter.  The staff were very attentive and actually quite funny. And the Korean Fried Chicken for Two?  Oh that was to die for! Juicy and tender chicken gently fried and then dipped in your favorite sauces!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a second visit for brunch. Not sure why this place seems to be so underrated, but I love it! I suppose it's a good thing because it means when I come for brunch, I know there won't be line ups.

I was slightly disappointed that they didn't have the fried cauliflower anymore! I remember last time I ordered it and it was amazing. But then again, that was like over a year ago.

Pulled pork Eggs Benny ($14)
Loved this dish! Really flavorful.The eggs were made just right, nice and runny. I love how the poached eggs were served on corn bread, not your typical egg muffin so it was slightly sweet, with a spongy texture. Interesting how the pulled pork was served on the side, the meat was really tender and the sauce was on point. Only comment was the veggies that came along with it were slightly too salty. Generally places place the pulled pork in the eggs benny, but I thought it was neat how the pulled pork was served on the side, so it was like literally breakfast and lunch side by side. 

Chicken thigh sandwich with Potato Soup ($14)
Remember to ask for the chicken to be cooked int heir 'secret menu' or 'house special' way, can't remember what term they used but the chicken was deep fried and tossed in their special sauce which tasted amazing. The sandwich was really tasty. The soup was a potato bacon leek soup. The soup was flavorful, not bland at all and the bacon added a nice crisp.

The food was slightly slow though, which wasn't ideal since the restaurant wasn't packed.
Really like the atmosphere here - they open up the windows and there's also a nice patio too"}
{"text":"Wait staff is pleasant, genuine, and knowledgeable! Food is very good.  The KFC is delicious as is the Chicken Thigh Sandwich. That avocado Aioli is incredible!! 

It's a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait for a table. But trust me, it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I leave a restaurant and feel elated. I love an amazing restaurant experience, few things make me happier. The lunch I just had at the county general was superb. F'n fantastic. 

Good quality ingredients, prepared respectfully and with care make for tasty food. Really tasty food - the burger was juicy, the bun was food-stylist perfect - the fries are slightly spicy, cooled nicely by a dip in their homemade ketchup, the salad with its shallot vinaigrette, parsley, and cilantro was one of the best side salads I have experienced in this city. 

The atmosphere, the music, the amazing non-alcoholic drink list (and don't worry...there's an alcoholic list too!),  the reclaimed wood tables and chairs and the food make this my new go-to lunch spot when I am in West Queen West."}
{"text":"Had an excellent burger and fries for lunch during their first lunch service yesterday. 

Service was very friendly, and down-to-earth. 

Nice wine list with many by-the-glass, and a creative original cocktails menu, as well as full bar with good selection of bourbons and whiskeys.

Cool woody interior design. Bar stools, and tables for two, so it's inviting and comfortable to dine/drink there solo or with others.

I can tell this is going to be a terrific casual place to bring a date."}
{"text":"It was a lucky find. I had their fried chicken and it was neat that they served it on parchment paper. I was glad they did because fried chicken gets messy and to already ha e the table as your plate didn't make you feel as bad if you made a mess!"}
{"text":"The County General is a really nice place to grab a bite or some drinks when you're in the Queen West area. The staff are friendly, attentive, and quick. 

There's a cool cabin-like atmosphere which makes for a relaxed, casual dining experience, whether you grab a seat out on the small patio, at a table at the front of the house, or right by the bar. You can expect some sort of chilled out music to be playing softly in the background. It's a great place to bring guests because it's not big enough to be loud and overly packed with patrons.

This location is rather small but doesn't feel cramped, and the food is the centre of attraction. Order the County Fried Chicken and they just might finish preparing the delicious Korean inspired dish right on your table (seriously, not even kidding).

Must-try items:
County Fried Chicken (for one or two)
Chicken Tenders 
County Burger
Fried Chicken Thigh sandwich

There are very affordable daily lunch specials that come up to $10 flat with a side included. Not to mention that the drink selection here is very extensive. These are just a few of the many reasons I'll be coming back often in the near future."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Get anything with chicken on it! Too bad their dishes can be a bit inconsistent.

I quite like the County General, from its woody interior to its large window and to its minuscule patio - it gives it a homey, westerny feel. The service is generally pretty good, though can be a bit slow, so if you're in a rush, order quickly!

The menu is succinct and mostly pretty good, especially their chicken. You must order their FRIED CHICKEN THIGH SANDWICH or the FRIED CHICKEN FOR TWO - you won't be disappointed! The dinner for 2 gives you a wide assortment of garnishes and sauces, and lettuce to wrap that fried goodness in. I've had the COUNTY BURGER which is pretty solid and deceptively small (you will be full!). the BIG SALAD is exactly that, but kinda bland. Though primarily a meatarian's paradise, they do offer some veggie selection: My DC ordered the WHITE BEAN \"MEATBALL\" SANDWICH, which is crusted in panko. He quite liked it so at least you veggie friends won't starve here! 

My one big complaint, though, is that while the quality of their dishes is mostly good, it can be inconsistent. On one occasion, they even \"ran out\" of the friend chicken sandwich...just as we rolled in for lunch at 12:02, and there weren't any other patrons. :S"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Really nice staff. The Bean & Pork soup could be a meal by its self, amazing! The Fried Chicken sandwich almost melted in my mouth, delicious! Our spicy Bloody Clamato's did the trick. A heavenly lunch indeed!"}
{"text":"Once again rude service this time from a male waiter. He would not provide a recommendation and pissed off that our table was there . I cannot enjoy my food if the staff is hostile."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with the best decor! I loveeeeee the heirloom tomato sandwich, fried chicken thigh sandwich and the croque madame. I usually get the fries to share! The heirloom tomato sandwich is my favorite because I can always taste how fresh the tomatoes are! :) The presentation is also really nice/appealing. Really good drinks here as well and the bartenders/staff are super friendly :)"}
{"text":"I love the set up of The County General. 

The side patio with wild vegetarian and rustic furniture for sure is cottage like.. simple and countrysidish.

My Yelp brunch buddies were really excited to try out their Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich ($14)  while I decide to have their Croque Madame Sandwich ($14).

I enjoyed my Croque Madame which was hearty and rich, thanks to the Bechamel Sauce. My brunch mates both said they were not happy with their fried chicken. Bland tasting? And I was not even offered a taste? How come they finished eating so fast? Maybe because of the small portions or they were just hungry?

Portion for sure are on the small side... as we decided to hit up The Drake for a late late brunch..."}
{"text":"Okay so the food is good, dependable.  The chicken is delish but they do pile o quite of but of sauces and toppings which seem overkill.

Been here a couple of time and both times have had a rather snippy waitress serve our table.  I think this will have to become a take-out only place unless that server leaves as it ruins the dining experience."}
{"text":"Great experience. Drinks were expertly crafted truly an excellent Manhattan. Food was delicious. The cornbread is sublime."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times - with groups, with my partner, with the in-laws - and it has always delivered. Great bar menu/bartenders and the food is delicious. We always get the fried chicken for two. It's really fun; they lay out waxed paper on your table and just dump a big bucket of chicken in front of you with spices, herbs and BBQ sauce layered on top. I must say, I was disappointed when I went last week (after a bit of an absence) that the fried chicken no longer comes with sides of biscuits and coleslaw. I did love the addition of sweet pickles to the chicken, but missed the sides dearly. A bite of fresh coleslaw is really needed to break up the heaviness/meatiness of a table full of fried chicken. It didn't even seem like you could order them separately. And I don't think the price of the meal decreased either."}
{"text":"When I came here for brunch on Sunday morning I was met with a line-up of like-minded diners also looking for grub at this new spot on Queen West. I'm not too keen on waiting for breakfast (you better believe I get cranky) but I left my cell phone number with the hostess and wandered the neighbourhood. In about 25 minutes, I was sitting at the bar eager to get my brunch on.

Like a lot of newer and trendy restaurants in Toronto this place has more wood than a lumberyard. From the dark wood floors, to the ceiling decorated with various sizes of cut 1x2s and the long wood benches you can be sure some trees took a hit in the name of food. Slender light fixtures like black Maglites point straight down over the tables, which suggests an interesting mood come nightfall. On a Sunday afternoon however, the west-facing windows mean a flood of natural light.  

Brunch is served from 11-4 on weekends. They have an omelette, eggs benedict, corn beef hash, a burger and the option I couldn't resist: a fried chicken sandwich. It's a whole chicken thigh fried in buttermilk batter and served on a MiniDisc sized milk bun with avocado, onion, and coriander. I opted to get it served with Bibb lettuce salad. The salad was great and made with fresh seasonal vegetables. I wasn't blown away by the chicken sandwich though. I was expecting something crispy; instead the chicken was soggy which made the already-difficult task of eating a chicken thigh poking out of a diminutive bun into a sloppy and difficult task. And I would dare say that the meat was *slightly* undercooked on the inside. I'm the type that hates overcooked and dry chicken, so I'm exactly complaining, but pink isn't perfect in my books. 

I'd definitely come back to try something else on the menu, or return for evening drinks. Seems like a really cool spot.

Obligatory Title Pun: In GENERAL you can COUNT on it. 

Menu Readability: Typewriter typeface on natural paper. Yawn.

Need to mention: The appear to have a very well-designed cocktail menu  which is heavy on the bourbon and whiskey. I approve.

What this place teaches me about myself: I shall start measuring the sizes of things with discontinued Sony products."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 5 on a Monday evening.  We ordered food and drinks. Their website says half price cocktails. We get the bill and noticed we got charged full price so we asked the waiter his response was \"We asked our IT guy to update it. We no longer offer this promo.  It ended a month ago and the request to update the site was put in last week.\"  We asked if he'd honor the false advertisement on their site and his response was 'No!'.  I've been here numerous times but I will never go again.  He could have mentioned that the promo is no longer valid when we started ordering drinks.   False advertisement + failed to tell us the promo ended + don't honor their site promo.  I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on the weekend and were seated quickly. It was good but the portion sizes were small which was too bad. A bit pricey as well."}
{"text":"Great service! Staff is very pleasant and knowledgeable. Their beer and cocktails are delicious. Food is delicious.  It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait for a table. And it's worth is as the food is incredible!"}
{"text":"Stopped by The County General for dinner tonight. Had the sausage platter, which was pretty good but a little bit pricey. The service was amazing, our waiter remembered us from the last time we were here (which was a while ago). All in all this place is a great place to eat !"}
{"text":"Disappointed today. Their chicken thigh sandwich staple was a disappointment. Like a chicken you buy from grocery store. :("}
{"text":"The County General has been on my radar ever since it opened. Opened by the folks behind Splendido, the tiny space at Queen St and just east of Ossington offers comfort food in a casual setting. Upon arrival, I was surprised at how tiny the space is. I had difficulty slipping into my seat!

As usual, I ordered for my mom and me, and we split everything. My first choice was the popular fried chicken thigh sandwich: buttermilk chicken, milk bun, avocado chutney, coriander, and green onion. I've read many reviews commenting on the small size of the sandwich. Of course, my mom and I have tiny appetites, so we weren't really concerned about the small portion. The side salad was very simple- mixed greens dressed with some olive oil and vinegar. It was a good counterbalance to a fried chicken sandwich.

I like the sandwich. But then again, I also like McChicken a lot, so maybe that's not saying much. The fried chicken thigh was nice and moist (I hate dry chicken) and avocado just makes everything better. Other than that, however, there was nothing remarkable about it (except perhaps it was the cutest fried chicken sandwich I've ever eaten).

My second order was a Croque Madame with country ham, grilled bread, béchamel, fried egg and herb salad. I loved the rusticity of the sandwich! The grilled bread had the perfect crunch and was so delicious with all the components. In particular, the country ham was super flavourful; I've never quite had ham like this before. Naturally, I love anything topped with sunny side up egg, and this was no exception. The croque madame definitely trumped the fried chicken sandwich.   

Our bill came in a cute flower pot, which was another charming touch. All in all, we had a pretty good brunch, but I wasn't blown away by any means. This restaurant is a nice spot in the neighbourhood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for brunch."}
{"text":"What an amazing find!!!  We needed to kill a few hours around Toronto and found this through Yelp. I have to think folks are giving this lower ratings to keep it a secret.  The \"KFC\" for two was cooked perfectly and the Beef tartar tacos (2) where to die for. Whether you like Bourbon or not, the house special \"Smoking Jacket\" is a drink to truly enjoy. I will be bringing my friends to this place!"}
{"text":"I was here for Bourbon Week so I have to caveat this review with that.  Many things I tried weren't otherwise available.

The atmosphere is warm and the small size of the venue makes it  feel intimate.  They had made a special version of an Old Fashioned that I loved but isn't normally available.  That said, I tried a couple of other cocktails and they were very well made.  The gin and tonic was amazing - which was something.  I have never been particularly impressed with gin and tonic.  The tapas were excellent, I had the duck and fish tacos.  I loved both but unfortunately once again I think neither are normally available.  If they predict the quality of what is on offer generally, I look forward to coming back and trying other options."}
{"text":"I went to the County General for brunch last Saturday morning. As most people, I love brunch. Friends, coffee, good food, maybe even a cocktail.

Twice in my life I have walked away angry from a brunch experience, and County General has the pleasure of being one of those times.

Let's be clear, people want one thing at brunch --  coffee. So when I was told that they only had Americano's to offer as coffee, I should have known this spot would leave me deeply dissatisfied. When said Americano arrived in the tiniest of mugs, and should actually have just been called an Allongé, I actually gasped out loud.

So here I am, greatly short on caffein and enjoyment and I peruse the menu. Interesting offerings, so I regain some hope. 

I order the South of the Border breakfast ($12), and I love bacon, so I order a side of what their menu labels as \"Perth Bacon\" for $5. What's Perth bacon I ask? The waitress has no idea. My friend pipes in \"maybe its from Australia\"?

Breakfast arrives. I obviously have no coffee left, and on principal I am not spending another $3.50 on two sips of a mis-named Americano. 

To the surprise of no one, breakfast is tiny. Like, \"where are we going to eat after this?\" tiny. Two poached eggs (mind you, perfectly cooked), a 3 inch by 1/2 inch long piece of corn bread, and some sauce. Everything under seasoned. Nothing delicious.

But at least I have \"Perth Bacon\" coming. Oh.. there it is.. 3 pieces of just regular bacon you get at a diner, but costs $5 here.  

22 seconds after receiving our meals, we were done. Doesn't take long to eat what amounts to an amuse bouche.

I pay for my friend's breakfast, my bill, FOR BRUNCH, came to $77.  $77 for under seasoned, petite food, and 2 sips of coffee each.

I looked around and saw a lineup out the door, and for the 2nd time that morning, gasped out loud... 

The County General is disrespectful to the dollar. They disrespect of customer's hard earned money. They work off an assumption that my money should be taken for granted and that I owe you something for being there. That's not how it works. If I am choosing to spend almost $100 at your brunch, respect my money, and give me value in the ways of service, food quantity, and food quality.

Why did I rate this terrible experience 2 stars and not 1? I do appreciate a perfectly poached egg!

TL;DR  ...Lots of money for a couple of under seasoned bites of food."}
{"text":"I'll abide by this General's laws any day. Especially the ones that dictate that when there, I must eat their scratch-made meals paired with artisan bourbon cocktails. Lock me up and throw away the county key, General. 

Last time I was here I had pork pot pie, and it was more of a stew topped with a crust, but regardless of its deconstruction it was creamy and hit the spot. I paired it with an old fashioned or three and they were top notch. Clink clink.

The ambiance is crowded, wooden and full of bubbly Queen W locals. Like me. If you think we could be friends, you'll probably like this place. If you think I'm a hipster who pays too much for sandwiches, this place isn't for you. 

PEPPER POINTS for having their bathroom on the main floor. I'm so GD sick of dungeon bathrooms."}
{"text":"Great place for good drinks in a central location. Any of their chicken items are very tasty. I ordered the chicken burger that they have with fries. My friends ordered the fried chicken for two. If you like sauce that is the dish for you! Great cozy place but not on my A list for Toronto restaurants."}
{"text":"Poped in one wednesday evening to give it a go. With 7 Tables and a bar for about 8 people, let's just say, you can always expect a wait. The staff is pretty great, and they'll take your number to call you as soon as you spot becomes available.

I like the atmosphere. It's that usual queen west hipster chic.

The main dishes are made for people who love flavours but don't necessarily love a full meal. I love places that serve meals that leave you wanting more, and this place certainly fulfills that - at least the prices are very reasonable, that you don't feel like you've been taken for a ride.

THE FOOD
6 oz Burger. Delicious. The quality of the meat, the bun, the mustard, pickle, and whatever else was a part of that burger, as quaint as it was, was damn delicious. Just thinking about it, makes me want to go back there. The price quite reasonable.

Ordered an appetizer of fries, and only being $3 I was impressed by the serving, compared to the main dishes.

Overall the atmosphere is great, the seating is limited, the food is cooked to perfection. If you don't mind the wait, I absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The drinks were nifty but the food was a disaster. I had the tourtière, best description \"Ass\" even my consistently ravenous dog kicked it around a couple minutes before putting in away. My lady had the chicken sandwich, \"what a bore\" I tasted.. No actually I did not... it was tasteless ... 
Love the ambiance and decor of the joint, and for sure would make a sweet drinking spot but I would honestly never ever attempt  to order food there again. 

Like really bad though.."}
{"text":"Got to County General about 5 mins before it opens and there was already a line up.  Recommend their fried chicken burger with fries.  I actually ordered the salad as a side but I ate more of my friend's fries than my salad.  Dish looks small but it's very filling!"}
