{"text":"Lousy customer service ; avoid at all cost - there's nothing breathtaking about the experience - you might just lose your breath dealing with incompetence. They took 150$ deposit from me and have yet to refund it 2 months later. 4 exchanges that had me dealing with immature and rude receptionists - a director that doesn't call back (I'm not the only one to say this by the way) . And honestly the place is not as nice as in the pictures. Stay elsewhere or rent a chalet you'll be much more at peace ."}
{"text":"We stayed here with our three kids and my mom. I highly recommend it - a great place. The Laurentians is one of the of the most beautiful landscapes on the planet - gently rolling hills, small lakes, scenic roads. We were here from very far away in the US, in winter, and it was well worth it. When we were there, this area north of Montreal was  bright with snow, and from the hotel we saw broad vistas of the lake and trees covered in the fluffy stuff. 

The kids and us had a long list of winter sports to sample nearby: tubing, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing and of course there would have been downhill skiing and snowboarding if we had time. They also loved the outdoor pools of different temperatures that were trippy to use in sub-zero weather. The food is fantastic and we ate well at the breakfast buffet and the dinners, which we had in the less expensive of the three restaurant options. Both my meals there - one with grilled vegetables and the other of sausages - were sophisticated and yummy. 

The rooms are clean and comfortable and up to date, with great bathrooms and space to put your clothes, and a sofa to relax on in front of a fireplace. The hotel has two buildings and the one we stayed in is geared to couples in its somewhat goofy branding, but it was perfect for everybody, including my mom, who uses a wheelchair. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They accommodated our various requests and went out of their way to help us out with information or anything else we asked for. 

There is a definite contrast here between the Laurentians vs. the corporate boutique-hotel soundtrack in the lobby, with the Victoria's Secret videos playing behind the reception desk. These touches were put there to create a metropolitan, couples vibe, and I think for  a lot of people this signifies \"cool\", but the natural beauty of the landscape outside and the friendliness of the staff comes through stronger, and is a better representation of what this part of the world is all about. In the nearby towns, there are plenty of tchatchke stores, that play up rustic Canadiana, or Quebec-iana, and the hotel could have played up the rustic or historical angle, and instead chose to go the Y2K metro-boutique-hotel route. The Y2K vibe would be distracting and get in the way, but these touches really end at the lobby and the rest of the hotel is just modern and comfortable.

It was a great experience for us, and being from so far away made it all the more special, even exotic. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially visitors from far away who want to experience a very special part of Quebec and Canada."}
{"text":"Good evening
This would be my 5th visit and I must say things have been getting worst over time.
For 250$/night here is my experience.

The spa outside and facilities are nice, the problem was the room

1- half the lights don't work, at 9pm, called reception they said they would send someone. No one showed up, called again still no one came all day. We went to sleep.

2- 2 televisions in the room,cone doesn't work and other is burned from the heat below it.

3- no such room service to change towels or anything

4- coffee and tea machine were so dirty there was still pieces of food still stuck to them.

5- the water to drink had way way too much chlorine.

6- the room (probably from carpet) smelled so bad we had to keep windows open all the time.

Look the place is good and 4/5 times our experience was good, this year they raised the price by 75$ only to make our experience worst. I guess cut corners, lower costs, maximize profits.

Won't be back here again,not worth and many other competition.

Good luck on your experiences"}
{"text":"Always love coming here.

I've had some pretty great memories from dancing to electric eel in the hot tubs at night to tanning by the pool with nothing but sunshine in sight.

I'm in love with the fire pit in the middle of the pool it's my fav part and I'm guessing everyone as well. Only thing that sucks is usually one is out of service on our last trip two were down but we still had 2 open.

Rooms are great ! Huge bed with sliding wall beside the bath tub so you can watch the tv from the tub or just have a conversation with someone lol. The double sided fireplace is great really sets the mood. Great kitchen so bring your own food depending how many days you're staying."}
{"text":"Bistro 260 is quite tacky. The food is OK, the service is OK, everything is just OK. We ended up here because Viking in Ste-Marguerite was closed. I have no intention on coming back. It's quite pricey and didn't wow me. If you're staying at the hotel, i guess you dont have much choice. I would have loved for them to have a cool bistro with yummy bistro favorites like a steak frites, onion soup etc. Plus, who serves a cold brownie with ice cream?! You put ice cream to cool the brownie, no?"}
{"text":"For 2 years now, hubby's employers have their Christmas office diner/party at l'Estérel, which includes one night.

This year, we decided to book the Friday as well and make it an adult weekend only! 

The rooms are very comfortable (beds and pillows too), having all that you may need, all renovated as a \"suite\" like. There is a small fridge and dishes and a microwave. You cannot cook a meal, but you may certainly heat something already prepared that you bought at the grocery store.

We visited the hot/cold spa; which is a love of mine. I was a bit let down, lacking greatly in \"relaxing\" space inside. Maybe they are making a new room (there was construction)...

I was certainly not impressed with the diner (over 300 people, so, i was not expecting much either), but their breakfast brunch were very good on both mornings.

Its a beautiful place for sure, surrounding lake and mountains, but as for what to do during the day, there is nothing much to keep you around during the winter months."}
{"text":"We stayed here for 2 nights (from Friday to Sunday). The resort has 2 hotels, we stayed in hotel Émotion.
There is nothing negative to say about this resort. 
** We did not try any, but the hotel offers a lot of activities according to the season. We loved the fact that it's only an hour away from Montreal.
We enjoyed spending time there as a couple, but both agree that our kids (1 & 5 years old) would like it too (we plan on going back with them).

Decor : 
This place is beautiful both inside and out. Everything is very modern, but warm and welcoming.
The rooms are very nice, clean, and the views are stunning. Outside, everything is spa oriented and peaceful.

Accommodations : 
The rooms are very well designed. We stayed in one of the smaller suites and did not regret it one bit. It's an open space concept with sleeping, lounging and eating area ; as well as a kitchenette. THE BALCONIES are amazing. minimum 100sq ft with nice furniture. I would suggest you spend the extra couple of dollars and book a Lake View room.

Spa : 
The hot baths, warm pools, steam rooms (etc) are an absolute must. We went when it was between -5 and 7 degrees outside, and were in no way affected by the cold. Enjoy!

Amerispa : 
There is an Amerispa on site that offer various services. Book ahead. They seem to be quite busy. TAKE NOTE : they are pricey. I would STRONGLY SUGGEST you buy vouchers from WaySpa (.com) and take advantage of the fact that they are affiliates.

Restaurant(s):
L'ultime - AMAZING. Everything was absolutely delicious. We were truly blown away. Definitely take the 5 course Table D'Hote pricing (about 60$), it's worth it. We loved the tartars (cold appetizer), the veal filet mignon melts in your mouth and the deer was outstanding. The desserts will convert you. The chefs creation and the mi-cuit are aboslute musts.
Bistro 260 - Very good bistro food. They have everything from pizzas to tartar (not cheap pizza). Nothing disappointed us. SUGGESTION : try the Esterel burger. Absolutely succulent. Bistro 260 is the menu you have in your room for room service. 

Staff : 
We were impressed by the professionalism of the staff. Everyone was very nice and fully bilingual. Calling for room service or for reception to bring you anything you need is a no-brainer. They were always quick and courteous. 
     - Restaurant staff : Polite and knowledgeable. They suggest wines and explain their menus clearly."}
{"text":"Very nice resort! Amazing view to the lake and rooms are super clean. Spa is very pleasant and personals are very friendly. Just around 1:15 hour from Montreal... Strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I stayed one night here in December, for a short weekend getaway with my girlfriend. Overall, the experience was extremely nice. The rooms are very spacious, very nicely furnished, with a luxurious bathroom and a gas fireplace. The fireplace is a such a nice thing to have on a cold winter day. The other great thing is the access to the spa with four massive hot tubs, a sauna and a hammam. We were almost alone when using the facilities and really enjoyed it. The only downside was regarding the many christmas parties that were happening at that time. The hotel was completely booked for companies and they took over the lobbies for cocktails and were generally loud guests. There was a party happening in the room adjacent to ours past midnight and the front desk did not pick up the phone for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"This review is after my second stay (first stay was three years ago)

A very nice location. Beautiful scenery with the lake. Nice facilities with regards to spas,  beach along with nice pools.

However, the building itself seems to be maintained minimally  with  dirty windows and passable common areas state and cleanliness. There is definitely a sense that the operating management is lacking and that the resort is degrading with time.

The restaurants are average with a relatively slow service and too-high pricing for the quality (at the Champlain notably). 

An  important issue is with the training of the staff. They do not seem to have received courtesy training that most high-end resorts should offer. 

Bottom line: very nice location, maintenance could be improved, staff training could be improved, and  pricing should be reviewed accordingly. Lacking operating management."}
{"text":"Grand besoin d'un très court séjour de repos. Spa, massage, calme, bonne bouffe... L'estérel est l'endroit idéal pour se ressourcer. Les chambres sont superbes, modernes, très propres, bien équipées. Dès le check-in, l'hôtesse nous offre un cocktail, gracieuseté de l'hôtel. Comme nous avions sacs à la main, nous avons décidé de le prendre un peu plus tard. Après un massage, pur délice. Dans l'hôtel se trouve Amerispa, où tous les services habituels de spa sont offerts. De plus, bains nordiques et saunas sont sur place. Super pour fin de semaine en amoureux ou séjour relaxant entre filles. Notre forfait incluait le déjeuner. Celui-ci est servi dans le restaurant Champlain, avec vue sur le lac. Wow. Déjeuner abondant, délicieux et à volonté. Seul bémol, le foyer bien que magnifique dans la chambre, dégage toujours une légère flamme, ce qui fait que la chambre est toujours un peu chaude, même en baissant la température de la chambre. J'y retourne c'est certain."}
{"text":"Came for a romantic getaway from our little one for the first time to celebrate our anniversary. Unfortunately it definitely did not live up to the hype. First floor room without a view. The Rok restaurant was over priced and not worth it. Paid $40 for a steak that we had to hack up with a steak knife and cook ourselves on a hot rock. The only saving grace was the crab cakes and the Tom Collins. Would never recommend this to anyone as a getaway worth the price. We asked if something could be done for this special occasion and we received 6 mediocre chocolate bites. Value versus the price was not worth it. Not the worst place we have ever stayed at but have been to less expensive places with better experiences. Requested lake view but were given a barely visible golf course view due to the resort being booked up  however the place was extremely quiet. Hard to believe that this place was at capacity."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful overnight at Esterel Resort.  We had a fabulous one bedroom with it's own hot tub overlooking the lake!  

Excellent experience with the 5 course meal in the main restaurant (Sal a Manger L'ultime) overlooking the frozen lake was great! You get a choice of soup or salad, then warm appetizer or cold.  There are about 5 of each warm and 5 of each cold with some being extra.  I had the soup (tomato) mushroom medley which was amazing!  For the main course choices as Elk, Rabbit, Lamb, Beef, Chicken, Salmon, Halibut, Lobster have something to suit anyone!  My choice was the Halibut.  Again very good!  My wife wasn't so impressed with the salmon. She thought it to be a bit bland.  Her vegetables she thought were lacking flavour as well!  For desert you have a choice of 5 or 6 different decadent choices.  I ordered the duo creme brûlée!  One was vanilla the other was coffee!  She ordered some sort of rich chocolate cake/brownie with caramel! It was fantastic!  This restaurant is a \"1 glass\" Wine Spectator recognized and has a very nice yet expensive list! Opus One 2007 for $700 a bottle? A tad gouging!  Otherwise regular restaurant wine pricing!  

We went into the other restaurant (Rok) after where they were grilling meat on a hot stone!  Interesting concept but quite the smell in the restaurant!  Especially when you are cooking Halibut! 

They have three restaurant choices, so it really does suit the resort feel!  L'esterel is fresh, modern in design and a very nice place to come if you would like a nice getaway or conference! Accommodations are new, modern and comfortable!  Breakfast buffet was very plentiful in the morning!  A vast selection of healthy and unhealthy!  All in all quite satisfied!"}
{"text":"The company I work for had our sales conference Monday to today ... it was held at the Estérel Resort which is about 1.5 hours NE of Montreal.  There are about 60 of us from across Canada.

Alas, because our days were jammed packed because of the conference, I didn't have time to enjoy the spa or check out the grounds.

Here's my room ... it was very nice!  The kitchen was stocked.  The bathroom was huge!  The tub was big and deep  and I soaked in it both nights with bubble bath.

I wasn't crazy about the food (except for Monday night).  When we arrived on Monday evening, many of us were hungry so we had a late supper at the bistro on site.  I was hungry and ordered beef ribs and potatoes au gratin.  You can imagine my (and everyone else's) wonderment when they arrived.  Though the potatoes were barely warm, the ribs were delicious and there was more than enough to share!

The rest of our meals weren't great.  Our lunches were buffet in one of the restaurants.  There was a pasta selection both days which I found kind of cold and hard (so sitting out too long).  There was a fish selection both days (a white fish yesterday and salmon today) ... I'm not a fish lover so didn't try them.  Yesterday's meat choice was beef with a weird texture and chewy.  Today's meat was some kind of game (venison maybe?) sausage which I passed on.  Supper last night was served to us in one of the boardroom and there were a couple courses ... rabbit and apple on a big spoon (I passed), mushrooms on a puff pastry (I passed), a small pork roast on pancetta with veggies (I ate the pork and it was okay) and a chocolate dessert square (which was okay).

It seemed like a fun place to spend some time regardless of the season."}
{"text":"Séjour tout simplement PARFAIT à l'Esterel!! Nous avons passé 3 jours (2 nuits) et n'avons rien à dire sur notre escapade! Nous avions une chambre vue sur le lac dans l'hôtel Évolution et la vue vaut le coût!! Toutes les chambres sont équipées d'une cuisinette et d'un foyer 3 faces: c'est vraiment super et confortable. Nous avons bien profité des bains nordiques et des saunas, et nous sommes allés marcher dans les sentiers extérieurs. Le service était remarquable. Nous n'avons pas testé les restos de l'hôtel alors je ne peux pas juger. C'est un endroit parfait pour une escapade d'amoureux, je veux y retourner!!!"}
{"text":"Exactly a year after my last stay, my boyfriend and I spoiled ourselves to another early Christmas treat. This time we spent 3 nights on the Evolution side of the resort which is marketed as more family friendly due to the extra queen murphy bed and closed bathroom. (All bathrooms on the other side of the hotel have a sliding door near the bath so it opens to your bedroom for a romantic soak).

We stayed in room 1204 which is on the ground floor facing the front of the hotel (not the lake) and also had our private hot tub. As with both hotels sides, many of the ground floor rooms come with private spas so I strongly recommend this option if you want the privacy and freedom of using it whenever you please. This time we did try the exterior spas as well and loved the experience. I didn't realise that there are little gas fireplaces in the middle of each spa so it's a great sight at night.

The rooms on the Evolution side are beautiful, decorated in tones of turquoise and grey, they look a little more modern compared to the Emotion side which has a lot of orange and fall foliage colors. 
Although we did not have the option of a panoramic suite as per our last visit, all rooms are very spacious at around 600sqt. I will tell you though that the panoramic windows do make a huge difference in terms of bringing in light as you are surrounded in 3 walls of floor to ceiling glass. We stayed in our rooms alot and I'm someone who loves to read so I was missing the natural sunlight and found that I had to turn on the lamps even during the day. The balconies above us also block a little of the light, so that may be something to consider if you love bright open spaces- try a corner panoramic room instead.

Our mini kitchenette did not have a stove top compared to our panoramic suite, I was not aware of this as I was planning on cooking. You do still however have a toaster oven, microwave, electric kettle, mini fridge and sink. We weren't huge fans of the food at the restaurants, so it's great advantage to be able to eat in your room.

The bed was very comfortable, just the right amount of firmness and plushness, the bathroom is super spacious and housecleaning did a great job of stopping by everyday to replenish our towels and supplies. Unlike my previous stay, I did not have any issues with the sink or toilet blockage and everything looked very well maintained.

I feel confident saying that no matter which room you choose it'll be well worth it, I can see myself coming to Esterel every year, it's just like having your own luxurious cottage away from home up north.

There are many winter packages and promotions during this time of year, it's the perfect gift and sure to please yourself or your loved ones. Come on the weekdays if you can, cheaper and much quieter. You will have all the facilities to yourself."}
