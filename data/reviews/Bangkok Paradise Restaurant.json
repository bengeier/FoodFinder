{"text":"In a neighbourhood rife with delicious food at incredible prices, I have no problem saying Bangkok Paradise is more than just the best Thai for your dollar...it's one of the best and most affordable restaurants on Queen West. 
The $7 lunch special is a godsend. With 4 options, there's something bound to tickle your Thai food fancy. I'm a big fan of the green curry. It comes with a spring roll and the most delicious vegetable soup I've ever had, and - like a lot of restaurants - it's not exclusive to dining in (so you don't have that dine-in guilt of denying the up-sell with a drink).
Being close to home, I've ventured there for dinner as well. The staff is always friendly and the food always tastes fresh and delicious.
I recommend the peanut chicken dish - a mix of sweet and savory, it's a safe bet for those who, like me, don't consider themselves Thai food experts.
By far the best Thai food restaurant between Spadina and Bathurst."}
{"text":"There are two broad types of Thai restaurants in Toronto. Those where the chicken is fatty and tendony, and those where the chicken is fatless and tendonless. Bangkok Paradise is one of the latter. The green curry chicken is great, and all of the dishes are quite reliably good.

The decor is not great, however, so if you can get take-out or delivery, all the better. The lunch specials are very cheap and nice; you can call ahead and pick up your lunch combo quick."}
{"text":"I ordered a Hot & Sour soup. It tasted like nothing but had the texture of cold, congealed turkey gravy. I was starving and could not stomach more than a couple sips."}
{"text":"Terrible, Absolutely terrible. Anyone here claiming this is good food let alone good Thai food has never eaten a meal with flavour before. Try Koh San Road or Sukho Thai if you want Thai food that actually tastes like Thai food. It was disgusting. Had the pork basil noodles- I promise I'm not on joking that in the whole dish was 4 basil leaves - the dish was basil pork but they decided that it wasn't worthy of the basil. My friend ordered the same +same problem. No flavour. Dry. Overcooked. The pork was indistinguishable from dog food. The pad Thai was as dry as an old boot. The edamame was older than time itself, tasteless, underseasoned, overcooked, garbage. Literally the worst I've had, and I've eaten it a lot. Seriously guys, this place is utter garbage. Save your money and go to the restaurants I mentioned earlier, this place is just bad."}
{"text":"Ok, so my husband says I should give Bangkok Paradise a three, but I refuse. 

Here's the story.  We went once in a big group over a year ago and the food was pretty good.  Nothing to run the streets screaming about, but it was enjoyable.  It came out quickly, portions were big, food was yummy.  Fine.

Most recently, we got lazy, couldn't get tickets to the Blue Jays opening game (booo) and decided to order in, stay in and stay comfy.  We used Justeat.ca, put in our orders with instructions (basic stuff like no egg, no tofu, spicy, etc.) and hoped for the best.  We ordered spring rolls, they were great.  Fresh, crunchy, dipping sauce was spicy.  Awesome.

We both ordered variations of basil noodles (we're an exciting couple, I know) and got dry, bland noodles.  His \"seafood\" basil noodles had three pieces of seafood.  Best of all, my basil noodles were chock full of egg and tofu.  That's right, exactly what I asked them not to include.  Either the chef has an effed up sense of humor or they literally disregard requests.  Either way, I wasn't amused.  I shall continue my search for awesome Thai food in Toronto."}
{"text":"My usual thai food order consists of Veggie Pad Thai & Red Curry.
I ordered the same last night for delivery, and it definitely didnt disappoint. The curry was nice and creamy like I like it and the pad thai was fresh and not soggy at all.
Add it to my list of acceptable take out."}
{"text":"Avoid! I ordered takeout from here this week and it was easily the WORST Thai I have ever had. I don't think anyone nvolved with this restaurant are Thai or know anything about cooking Thai food. 
The pad thai - big lump of orange noodles with no meat, tofu, onions or peanuts. I also ordered the radnar and they used the wrong rice noodles and t was just a clump of noodles sitting in this flavorless grey sauce. The worst was the curry and the cashew nut chicken. The curry - could barely ke out any curry taste and it did not taste as if any coconut milk was used. The cashew nut chicken was like a chinese style stir fry in a grey, watery, flavorless gravy. 

All in all horrible food. We had plenty of leftovers but nobody wanted to eat them.

Oh. The rice was ok."}
{"text":"For Take-out only- as I can't stand to sit down in the brick-colored tile covered room with not much in the way of decor. If you don't have a place to take it out to, eat in if you must.  I have found their green curry to be one of the more complex flavours in town. My favorite thai dish has become the glass noodles with Shrimp. The take out portions are enormous!  I can hardly eat half of it. It has this flavor that is addictive. I can't speak to many other dishes. The service is super friendly and it's a real mom and pop kind of place. I recommend this over most Thai places in town. Worth a trip to taste the green curry! 
$25 for 2 meals and dessert"}
{"text":"Got delivery the other day. Ordered the green chicken curry and the pad thai.  The green chicken curry was very good with the right amount of spice.  The pad thai on the other end was super bland, one of the worst I had tried.  I got to go try some other dishes next time as I am mixed on this place at this time."}
{"text":"Wow. The worst pad Thai I've seen or eaten. Sorry, I only had one bite. The sight of it was enough to turn me off. The mango chicken looked like it came from Manchu wok. Super sweet sauce. It was edible and not as bad as the pad Thai. The food was cheap in price and cheap in quality. You get what you pay for. Not sure what kind of food this was, but it was definitely not Thai food."}
{"text":"Great Mango Salad, my alltime favorite Thai dish
Coconut soup with chicken - tom kha gai not great, had many better
Pad Thai kinda blah, 
Red curry lamb was so so, and was a small portion
Loved the Sticky Rice with Mango dessert!

Wouldnt recommend, but would try again"}
{"text":"While it is right on Queen St. West, it's kind of hard to find because the sign overhead no longer says Bangkok Paradise, but has the name of a sushi place, and the Bangkok Paradise sign is now a small one in the window.  I passed it once, thinking it was no longer around.   They now do sushi and Thai.

I had the chicken hot and sour soup, a couple of chicken satay, and the lamb curry.  It was very good.  You got a good portion of meat, unlike some places I have been.  I wasn't asked how hot I wanted the curry, but it came out pretty spicy which was good.

I read some reviews here that mark down the restaurant for its decor - it seemed fine to me.

Prices were reasonable, so I would consider this a good value."}
{"text":"Bland bland bland food. Had the chicken pad thai, was dry and lacking in flavour.  Texture was decent enough. Quick delivery tho! :') was fairly inexpensive as well. Which, you get what you pay for..."}
{"text":"Got the red curry lamb with rice after reading one decent review on it.

It was barely edible. The lamb was in slices (never seen lamb like this?), tasted very gamey and so very chewy. Am I eating lamb or gum? I honestly can't tell. 

The curry was very mild for red curry which wasn't a horrible thing for me (someone who doesn't enjoy spicy) but if you were in the mood for some kick with your curry, don't get this. 
I agree with past reviewers that this is the worst place I've ever gotten delivery from. Also probably the worst thai food I've gotten. The prices aren't cheap either at 13.99 for the lamb curry

The veggies were alright hence the 2 stars but it's so hard to screw up vegetables. 

Perhaps there are a few decent dishes warranting the other 3+ stars reviews but 100% DON'T get anything with lamb. With so many great thai places downtown, I would avoid coming to Bangkok Paradise."}
{"text":"While I've never had 'authentic' thai food, I *am* picky about what I eat.

This is one of those meals I CRAVE, every so often.

I always get the same thing:
Veggie pad thai, no tofu, extra veggies &
Golden Curry Chicken w/coconut rice
and 4 veggie spring rolls.
And it comes to about $34. 


It's also a meal the keeps giving - 
You order this, and it will keep you full for days.

I never eat in, as the find the atmosphere cold & dreary, but the tables and chairs are wobbly. 

Just call ahead, and place your order for pick up. 
OR, if you're lazy (or sick) they do have delivery, which is quicker than most delivery places in Toronto. 

This yummy food, is total feel-good food, and you won't regret trying it."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!! 
This is NOT in any way shape or form Thai food.
I suspect the owners are Chinese as the food used is mainly chinese ingredients. The owners should be ashamed they are parading their dishes as thai when clearly they are not cooking thai cuisine.

The food is bland and boring and has not one single ounce of Thai flavour to the dishes. The Pad See Eew I ordered was a sloppy mess with the wrong noodles used, no sweet soy just a hot mess of Chinese stir fry.

The salads I ordered I will not even eat, the beef is wet and soft and is really suspicious, I don't know how they cooked it. There is no lime or fish sauce in the salads, just awful.

I got 2 mango cold rolls which were big and fresh, but one can't really go wrong rolling up some vegetables in rice paper. Dipping sauce was watered down and horrible.

Do yourself a favour and not order from here if you are after a Thai meal because you certainly won't get it."}
{"text":"Forgot to order rice with my order (thought it was included with the dish), but good thing I had some instant uncle bens to heat up.

Ordered thai basil chicken and padthai.  well, the uncle bens rice was easily the best part of the meal.

avoid this place !"}
{"text":"Got delivery from Bangkok paradise. Food was ok, nothing special but not bad.  I did find 2 peices of steel wool in my food and bit down on a 3rd.  Called them and were met with an overly rude individual who basically told us tough luck.  After saying we will get the health inspector in their restaurant they said they will bring us our money back at some point tonight.  Wouldn't recommend this restaurant as they obviously have no cleaning standard or food safety standard.

Watch out!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Pre-Set Dinner for 2 over the phone.  Considering the menu is \"Pre-Set\" it was a replica scene from \"Dude where's my car\" where the woman over the phone kept saying \"and thennnn\".  Took us at least 6 times to explain the phone number and address to her.  She said it would be at least 45 minutes.

We went downstairs to grab some drinks from the grocery store.  25 minutes tops we were gone.  In that Time we'd \"missed\" the delivery.  Called them back and they said they'd be on the way.  Another 30 minutes later I get a text saying the driver is downstairs of my condo to go to the door.   We go downstairs.  No driver.  Another 20 minutes goes by and finally we receive 2 burnt, cold spring rolls, clumpy unseasoned pad thai, and the most boring green curry I've ever eaten.  And Green Thai curry is My.Favorite.Food. EVER!!!!  

The coconut mushroom soup was really good however...once mircowaved,

Never again.  No.  Just... No."}
{"text":"This place is a long time favorite of mine on Queen West. They used to be a few doors down and have now combined with a sushi restaurant called I (heart) sushi. So if you're planning on going there, look for the sushi place. 
I usually order for take out or delivery. Their food is very reliable, they're typically fast (for pick-up), delivery is the standard Toronto delivery, between 45-60mins regardless of how far you live. 
I've never eaten at the restaurant so can't review service but the place is not overly inviting. It's very simple."}
{"text":"I just had to give a low rating to offset all the other high ones to warn people away.

I should've known it was not going to be good when I couldn't find the restaurant on Queen Street W. Up and down the street I went in puzzlement until I called them to inquire as to their location. I then realized that there is no Bangkok Paradise of its own, in fact i was now part of \"I Love Sushi\". Hrmm... japanese and thai in one? Not off to a good start. Reminds me of all the Asian restaurants I see in small non-Asian towns, where they seem to think Japanese, Thai, Chinese food are all the same, and crammed into one restaurant for people that don't know better. That might be ok for those places, but c'mon... this is Toronto.

Anyways, this was confirmed by the food I picked up. The shrimp pad thai was bland and flavourless. It was simply noodles mixed in some orange sauce, with 4 shrimps, and no vegetables. All for $9.99. This is possibly the worst pad thai I've ever had, and I've had plenty, including in Thailand. Honestly you would be better off getting it from Thai Express - fresh, tasty and cheap.

The only redeeming feature was the red and green curry we ordered. That was passable, and it had an appropriate amount of meat and veggies. Which made the lacklustre pad thai all the more puzzling.

With so many other superior thai places in town, I seriously can not think of a single reason to give this restaurant another try."}
{"text":"After a pretty difficult day, I decided not to cook and to order take-out instead.  I went on Orderit.ca and found this place that delivers and does not charge a delivery fee.  Well, that sounded perfect for my lazy butt today so I went ahead and placed an online order.

I called 20 minutes later just to make sure that they are working on it.  The lady said that the order left the restaurant but did not know when it would arrive.  40 mins later, I call again and now I'm getting really hungry and cranky, she calls driver and says he's coming.  I realized that I pre-tipped.  The driver comes and hands me the food but doesn't let go of the bag while he gives me an excuse of why he's late.  Kinda sucks, if this was pizza, it would have been free.

I say thanks and then close the door.  I don't buy the story, but feel a little bad that the store will probably not payout my pre-tipped amount to the driver. 

The pad thai is kinda warm but clumpy and there's not enough sauce.  The curry is a dinky little portion.  The curry is pretty good though.  Overall, bad experience, will probably not order from here again."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is perfect for my lunch take out. Never fails to be a decent bite and there are a lots of options on the menu. Service rocks. I was actually picking up my food one day and an old man at the counter who was complimenting the staff actually turned to me and said it was the best service of his life (he was pretty funny, actually).
I echo the other sentiments of the decor being a bit drab, but the food is great, so I can get past it!"}
{"text":"Easily the worst place I've ever gotten delivery from.

The hot and sour soup smelled very metallic and I couldn't get myself to try even a little. The Golden Curry was bland and more potatoes and carrots than curry. The Pad Thai looked anemic and disgusting. The appetizer platter was edible.

I wasn't expecting great Thai food from here but what we got was so disappointing. The lack of quality and care are worrying and I won't be surprised if I get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Far from \"Paradise\".  This place must be run by Chinese, posing as Thai.  Nothing is Thai about this. This is obviously Chinese style cooking. Heaving frying / cooking with oil and Chinese style sauce. Complete let down. Just like Chinese run sushi restaurants. Stick to Chinese cooking and advertise you restaurant as such and don't imitate something you can't replicate."}
{"text":"Used to live above the place, and ate here ALL the time...but the orginal owners moved on..I havent tried it since the 2005 when they left and the new management took over."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from the place. They arrived right at the expected time they told me. The pineapple fried rice was decent... but it didn't taste Thai at all. More like Chinese food. Still, it was decent. The green curry chicken is super delicious though so that bumps this place up to 4 stars. Pretty good portion sizes."}
