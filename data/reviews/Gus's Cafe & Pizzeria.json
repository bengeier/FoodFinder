{"text":"Order a pizza and Greek salad, must say pizza great, Greek salad not one I would order again from there, tasteless, consisted of huge chunks of tomatoes, cucumbers some green peppers a little bit of feta cheese. A waste of money, it was actually the worst Greek salad I have every had."}
{"text":"Expected painful experience for restaurant in this small Professional building across street from Foothills Hospital.  Quite surprised to find great home-y food - they even have great sizing on the pizzas - 6\" ones!  And the Greek salad had no lettuce and good olives which was appreciated."}
{"text":"Pizza made with so much love it will make you cry.   This is absolutely positively most sincerely my most favourite pizza place in Calgary. Why? Greek style pizza made with fresh crust daily (even a couple times time throughout the day as far as I understand). The sauce and toppings are fresh and generous as well as the cheese... Oh the cheese... *drool* A perfectly crafted pie that I know you will love! We love it so much we have ordered delivery and pickup even though it is further away from us.  What I recommend - Roma, Ceaser salad and super super yum garlic toast.   The staff are wonderful here as well. So wonderful they usually remember your last order and are very good with names and faces as their customers are always repeat ones in the community and surrounding area. The restaurant is small but always clean and there are always fresh carnation flowers set on the tables. The food is so good the staff eat at work every night at their own designated table!   Perfect pie. So do it!"}
{"text":"This is a small, somewhat Spartan family run restaurant In the Foothills Professional Building.  Their main focus is pizza, and while my wife enjoys it, I'm personally not a big fan.  The cheese is not quite bubbly or stretchy enough, and it is on the top, making the deli meats underneath a little poached rather than crispy.  Maybe that's your bag, but I'd suggest going with the ample and vibrant Greek salad, along with the quesadilla."}
{"text":"I was meeting up with a large group of friends recently, and one of them recommended we go to Gus's for dinner. I must say, it was an excellent choice! So one down side to this place is location. I'm from the south, I drive up to Foothills fairly often so I'm good with the route, but unfortunately this place is just a little bit beyond my general knowledge of the area so I did get lost trying to get into the parking lot. The other downside: I think you have to pay for parking. We were there on a Saturday night so the waitress said we didn't have to, but it sounds like you would on other days.   Beyond that I really have nothing to complain about. It's called a Cafe for good reason. It's quaint and homey and is the same size and atmosphere as a cafe making it a really good place to hang out with friends. My group was about 20 and most restaurant staff would be kind of moody with a group of that size but they were really polite (granted we were the only people there). You'd also think with a group of that size ordering at once they'd be really slow at giving us our food (especially with only two kitchen staff) but they were on par with other places. They make mini pizza's (6\") which I think is pretty sweet. The menu isn't too fancy but they have some really good sandwich, and pasta choices, but the biggest seller probably is the pizza.   The one thing I really loved was that the waitress wasn't pushy. We sat for hours after finishing our food just to talk, and the only reason we knew they closed at ten was because a couple of us asked, not because they were standing there trying to force us out.  All in all, great atmosphere, fabulous customer service, and pretty darned good food."}
{"text":"Fast service and food was delicious!!!  I wasn't sure to eat here because of the way it looks from outside (part of an old building) but I gave it a try after reading good reviews on yelp. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and good quality. Clean place and friendly people."}
{"text":"Best pizza in they city of Calgary.  Pricey yes, but this is real pizza, not bad cheese on cardboard. So if you are a grown up, this is the pizza for you!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza!! Great homemade taste!! Staff are always pleasant!! I work at FMC and when we're doing pizza lunches for staff and docs.. Gus's is always requested! Just wish you were open a bit later for us nurses who finish work at 11:30pm!!"}
{"text":"Now these people know how to make pizza I come here whenever I can I love there pizza another great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best meat sauce, couldn't finish eating my meal cause it just had an off taste to it. And delivery driver was a mess. He called cause he said I gave the wrong address but I'm pretty sure I know my own address and eventually he found my house and he could wait a couple minutes for me to find change I was short on cause I thought I had given an exact amount, and when I finally went to give the change he was gone."}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Salad was ok. Bruschetta was not good. I'd go back for pizza that's about it. Great place for take out pizza."}
{"text":"Aaack! I'm going to regret writing this review as I honestly believe Gus' is one of Calgary's hidden gems. Located at the base of a medical building across from Foothills Hospital, one unacquainted wouldn't think to expect a whole lot given that restaurants on hospital or medical complex property are usually just only a tad better than what a porter might bring on a tray in to your hospital room....  Well Gus' is far from that. Gus' serves Greek/Traditional style pizza and it's delicious. The dough is baked to perfection and the topping are plentiful and fresh.   Take out is also an option, but because seats are always quite easy to come by, there's no reason not to dine in!"}
{"text":"I tend to stop in here when I have appointments in this building.  It's delicious food - I heart the Roma pizza particularly, a veggie pizza topped with feta, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomotoes and some other things which are a bit different and quite yummy.     This is just a small place and it's quite busy (hospital staff are regulars) so I'd make a lunch reservation or come early.     One thing I like best about lunching here is that they validate parking for the building there which can be quite pricey... thus,  I like to grab a bite and head to my afternoon appointments with validated parking and some yummy pizza in my tummy.  To validate parking you need to park and go directly into the resturant.  Tell the server (usually the owner) your plate and stall number and she'll validate your parking in the system.  No need to visit the parking meter or anything like that.  I do have to warn you to remember and do this first thing after entering the lot - that lot is viciously patrolled and tickets are steep ($90)."}
{"text":"The pizza at Gus's is exactly what I look for: lots of cheese, decent sized crust (and dough base), and a good amount of toppings. Checks all of my boxes. I will definitely be back the next time I need some 'za in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Went to this place thanks to the suggestion by the birthday girl, and let me tell you, it was a nice surprise... You have several options such as soups, sandwiches, salads, pasta, subs, and of course pizzas (on different sizes). I decided to order a lasagna and I was very pleased with my choice. Just be careful if you are watching your carbs... the lasagna came with garlic bread which definitely surpassed my daily carbs intake. They have take-out food, we saw people picking up several pizzas and other food items. There is validated parking, you don't need to enter it in the machine, just give your plate and parking stall number to the server and s/he will validate it for you."}
{"text":"I work at the hospital across the street and this evening myself and two friends from work decided to try out Gus's. We ran over and were nervous when we saw that the restaurant was full save our reserved table (we only have a certain amount of time for dinner). Service was good and fast...the pizza my partners ordered looked great..my bruschetta as semi-gross, only tomatoes and they were the mushy spongy kind. French onion soup was tasty. I'd go back, but for pizza or salad only."}
{"text":"Usually love the pizza at this place (however the last time we had it for takeout the crust was soggy and it was far below their usual quality). That being said, we have enjoyed many meals here - the food is usually great and the pizza, delicious!"}
{"text":"Love going to this super cute restaurant! I work quite close to Gus's and it has been a go to place for our work lunches. We either visit the restaurant or order delivery.   The service is great and you can really see that the owners and servers really care about their customers.  The portion sizes of their food is great. Their pasta dishes are good for 2 people, in my opinion, as it is quite huge. Ive tried all of them and all of them and they are all good. Their pizzas are also quite good - I would definitely recommend their ham and pineapple pizza and their veggie pizza.  Gus's restaurant is a bit small so you have to make sure to call beforehand to reserve a table especially if you are a large group.   So I definitely recommend Gus's for sit down and delivery."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that I am slightly disappointed by Gus's Cafe.  I was hoping that, since I moved in right across the street, this would be my new favourite place for lunch, dinner and late-night take-out.  Sadly, it will not be my new most frequented place.  I find the food to be of a mediocre quality.  I'm not sure what kind of cheese they use on their pizza, but it was very bland and not as yummy and cheesy as other pizza's I've had.  It did have a homemade feel to it, but not restaurant quality homemade... if that makes any sense.  The pasta I ordered for delivery one day also didn't quite make par either.  I was feeling particularly lazy one weekend and thought a nice, fresh pasta would really hit the spot.  Unfortunately the pasta didn't seem that fresh.  The pasta on the bottom of the box was rather hard and crunchy, and the sauce was just poured on, not mixed around at all.  I will say that I quite enjoy the people working there.  They are nice and always in a good mood to joke around with you.  The prices of the food aren't too terrible either.  For the size of the proportions, it's actually quite reasonable.  I haven't completely given up on Gus's, but I won't say it's my favourite either."}
{"text":"Definately a hidden gem! I loved this place! Fairly small and clean restaurant, the service was really good as well!  Loved their pizza, but their macaroni and cheese was out of this world! Served bubbling hot to the table it was the perfect creamy mac and cheese. Good portion too! I had the best lunch the next day ;) Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"Every time we get Gus's at the hospital, it is excellent! I super love their pizza and they have always delivered exactly what we ordered exactly on time. The pizza is my absolute favourite!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! I've been to Italian restaurants that charge twice as much and not this good. Great portion sizing.   The restaurant itself is quite humble, as it is situated in a business building. For a more casual encounter.   Would eat here again. Wasn't too busy, waitress was a nice lady."}
{"text":"When you work at FMC your lunch options are how you say, limited. Luckily, just across the street there lies Gus's Cafe which makes some of my favourite pizza in the city.  They have about 12 tables inside the restaurant, but they offer a 6\" pizza which is perfect for lunch. You feel fancy sitting amongst all the healthcare providers, cause you can tell, they all have their AHS IDs out.  When we need to cater, Gus's is perfect for it, other than pizza they offer a rockin' greek salad to accompany your meal. I try to restrict the number of slices I eat, but when it's Gus's I usually have at least 3.  So very tasty. You can't go wrong with any selection, but I dig the Gus's special."}
