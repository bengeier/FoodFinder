{"text":"Ordered a Philadelphia roll, it literally has kraft cheese slices on it.. I've always had cream cheese in it.  So gross!! Salmon avocado roll falling apart. Will not eat here again! Very low quality!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a new Sushi Place you must check out Sakuri Sushi Japan.  We just happened to walk around the neighborhood and stumbled upon it and today was there grand opening.  The place is very clean, the service was excellent, and the food was awesome.   They have cool shushi boats!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fairly ridiculous portion. Soup and salad comes out ONLY half a bowl if any. Everything are fairly typical. However, for the price, I have gone to much much better restaurant for the same typical food. This would be my first and also my last for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful little sushi joint that is hidden away in the strip mall off of center street and 64th ave.

Great food! Love their Caterpillar Roll. It is amazing, delicious unagi/eel and creamy avocado on top of a fresh salmon roll and smothered in a finger licking teriyaki sauce!! They also have excellent \"shooters\" which is pan seared salmon with this sweet and tart sauce on top. Yum~ 

They also have really good bento boxes that are not miniscule and are very fresh. They have great teriyaki chicken (I usually am not a huge fan of teriyaki but I have no idea if it is the sauce or crispiness that is just sooo good!). I have been there about 5-6 times in the last 2 months since I discovered them.

Service is friendly, although, each time there seems to be less and less waitstaff...
The only reason they did not get 5 stars is that I have had better sashimi elsewhere in terms of quantity and quality.

Overall, though I really love this place. This neighborhood has been lacking a sushi place for a while and is now a convenient solution for my sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"This place is a small sushi shop amongst other restaurants, however it's worth the visit.

Their food is pretty average, and there isn't anything to special, however the service was great, with the waitress always being avaliable and helpful."}
{"text":"Our family loves the food here!  Prices are great, food quality is excellent and portions size is plenty.  The sushi is always fresh, but their ramen?  Wow!  It's seriously exceptional!  The broth is bursting with flavor, the egg is always perfect and the pork melts in your mouth.  The only thing I don't like about coming here is I can never decide what to order because everything is so good.  Ok maybe that's a good thing. We go here at least once and week. The staff are super friendly and truly care about the customer's experience.  Keep up the good work Iris and crew!  You have many happy customers because of your food and service."}
{"text":"Having lived in Vancouver for 18 years before coming to Calgary for school, I'm used to and spoiled by the cheap yet good quality sashimi back home.

I came here due to a friend's recommendation of their salmon don. For $13, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the fish. Their soy sauce (which had hints of sesame oil and sugar) complemented the dish well. It also came with a small serving of salad and miso soup. The service was quick and attentive.

Overall, I had a good experience and would like to return!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise it is to find this little gem hidden in my neighborhood! Must say, the portion sizes are exceptional...the BBQ salmon skin roll is huge! Really good value. 

I started with miso soup and loved every bit of it. Definitely no bland soup here, it was full of flavor. The salmon sashimi was fresh and beautiful, as was the chopped scallop temaki. This was a bonus as the nori wrap was toasted nicely and still crisp when it arrived. 

The BBQ salmon skin maki...for $4.00 I was expecting six small pieces of maki with little bits of salmon skin. BUT NOOOO, they impressed me again with four lovely large maki pieces full of crispy skin and cucumber. The sweet sauce was drizzled on without soaking the roll. 

To finish off my delightful meal, I just couldn't resist a little green tea ice cream. (Just the thought of it enticed another satisfied diner to order some as well.)

I will definitely be back...with friends!"}
{"text":"This new Japanese restaurant opened in the NW about six weeks ago.  We had been there for both lunch and dinner.  

For dinner, we had their love boat, which was $34.  The food is served in an actual 'boat', that takes up a lot of space... which is why a lot of restaurant don't use this old school serving 'boat' anymore.  However, I like it as it makes a presentation statement.  The food itself was decent.  It hits the spot but isn't the best sushi I have ever had.  

For lunch, we tried their bento boxes.  All their bento boxes includes a soft drink which you can substitue for a miso soup.   I had the bento box that included sushi, sashimi, and california rolls.  It was $13, which is what I kind of expected.  The quality of fish was good and preparation of the sushi rice was good... again not the best in town, but average or above for sure.

The service was good... the waitress was friendly.   The place was a bit quiet when we went for dinner on a weeknight and was welll looked after.  During our lunch experience, the place was more busy.  The waitress definitely had her hands full and therefore was a bit unorganized.  However, she was friendly and tried her best to look after us.  The owner also came by to see if we are looked after as well... Overall I have good experiences with this restaurant and will for sure make a return trip down the road."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a different sushi place and went here based on yelp reviews. It was a Thu night and restaurant was practically empty - lady gestured for us to sit anywhere, so we headed for the table by the window and the lady stopped us telling us it was reserved. Went to sit at the small table beside that too and she also said it was reserved.  No reserved signs put on the table until we made a fuss about it - and by the time we finished eating and left STILL nobody had taken those reserved seats, which only meant she didn't want to serve us in an area she'd have to clean separately after. 

Should've trusted my gut to leave when we first came, as the place smelled fishy and service was slow. Sushi rolls were also nothing spectacular, but very mayonnaisey (so if that's what you like then a good place to go)."}
{"text":"Weekends in Calgary are the best. After a couple hours at the grounds, our group wanted sushi and one of my friends randomly looked up and found Sushi Mori. I had no idea that they serve ramen but when I saw it on the menu, I was stoked! Located in a random strip mall area all the way out in Thorncliffe neighbourhood, I knew it was going to be good the instant I saw the outside. Hello hidden gem.

We arrived pretty late Saturday evening (around 9pm) but there were still quite a few tables occupied. When you first walk in, they have a daily special menu which I highly recommend you look at. I glanced at it and from what I remember, they had a couple really good deals. 20 pieces of sashimi for $24.00??? Wow. Dealz. I also spotted a lobster dinner for four that was going for $108.00. Sounded like a lot of food for a really reasonable price. Next time!

- Tom yum BBQ pork ramen ($13.95) - tom yum ramen??? Um, yes, it's going dowwwwwwwwwwwwwn. The broth was intense, packed with tons of flavour and even had a satisfying kick to it. This is why people are addicted to ramen. When you have a good bowl, you're hooked. The BBQ pork was melt in your mouth tender with a smoky char to contrast all the fattiness surrounding it. If you like fat, you'll love the way Sushi Mori does their chashu. Oh, and can't forget about the egg. Perfectly done with the right consistency and ooze. Brilliant.
- Spicy miso BBQ pork ramen ($13.95) - I had a taste of the spicy miso broth. Good flavour but mine was definitely the winner out of the two. My friend agreed. Haha, the grass is always greener on the other side.
- Teriyaki beef with rice ($11.95) - comes with a miso soup and salad. Another friend tried out one of their don bowls. Seemed pretty standard but she enjoyed it.

Awesome little spot for sushi and ramen! I can't believe there are so many places like this in Calgary to eat at. So jelly. The ramen list just keeps on getting better and better for me in Cowtown. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The owner is a nasty lady who has bad manners and sets a poor example of customer service for her staff.

food took very long to come out post order. Presentation was careless and the \"special\" Spider roll had only 4 peices at a premium cost of $13.50 **see photo attached 

SAVE YOUR MONEY. And search for another local sushi establishment to support. This place is shit and the customer service is a joke"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch once and I was impressed.  Their lunch portions are huge.  I could not finish it all so I had a decent sized afternoon snack.

Prices are reasonable too compared to other Japanese restaurants.

They have Bento box combinations and lunch specials."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome!! The place is clean and the service is fast and friendly. 
I'm always excited to show up there and have amazing service and food that melt in your mouth. I sushi there is so so fresh and tasty.  One of my favorite places in Calgary"}
{"text":"This little Japanese place is a very good value. Salmon sashimi slices are huge, one Salmon Don is enough to fill you up. Their Ramen is pretty good too, the pork neck pieces with the Ramen were super tender though the noodles themselves are just ok. They did say their Ramen soup base is made with over ten hours and has no MSG. 

Very nice neighbourhood restaurant and prices are reasonable for Japanese fair. The service we received was also top notch."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood spot.  The restaurant is small and cozy. My friend and I ordered the sushi & sashimi deluxe platter for two.  For $38.95, you get 10 pieces of sashimi, 8 pieces of sushi, 1/2 seafood futo maki, a cucumber roll and a dynamite roll, it's also serves with soup and salad. The sashimi were very generously cut, nice large pieces.  All the fish were fresh tasting, none had any fishy smell. Unfortunately they were out of miso soup, so we didn't get the full platter experience. Admittedly, everything we tried wasn't unique or different from any other sushi place in the city, BUT for the price, you get ample food and as fresh sushi as one can get in calgary. I recommend this neighborhood gem."}
