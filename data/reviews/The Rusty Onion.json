{"text":"Food is just ok, service has always been pretty good. It's a quiet spot with a great patio.  And I really don't mind paying an extra $2.50 to sub onion rings as my side.  But charging 50 cents for a side of ranch dressing us RIDICULOUS."}
{"text":"This place is my neighborhood bar.  Can't be beat. The food is always tasty. The pizza is great. My hubby loves the BBQ chicken pizza."}
{"text":"Much improved since they first opened - this was my fourth visit, haven't been in for a few months and was pleasantly surprised that it had a great crowd for a Saturday night, live music was so good we gave him a tip. Had drinks and dinner with five other people, everyone commented that our service was excellent and that the food prices had been reduced from our last visit. I hope that others are willing to give it another try too!  I've had the hippie black bean burger and it is great, portion size is good and they have a great selection of craft beer and more of a wine list now too"}
{"text":"Good food & Local beer selection Friendly staff & Owners on site and involved  The gluten free pizza was good. Not cross contamination from gluten in the kitchen.   Vegan cheese not bad either."}
{"text":"Called at the last minute after a wedding with a party of 16 and they did a great job!  We hade everything from burgers to chicken sandwiches to calzone to pizza to salads.... and it was all great.  So sorry I do not remember our servers name but she couldn't have done a better job."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an excellent dinner here this evening.   We shared a Popeyes salad which was a delicious spinach salad wth Gorgonzola cheese.   Then I had the Greek pizza that was super tasty.   Our server was really sweet and prompt with everything.   The owner came over and introduced herself and had a pleasant conversation with us.   Great place!   We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent beer! I live right around the corner and have been several times in the last couple of weeks.   The staff has been very attentive each time I've been. The owner Jimmy has been there to ensure quality every single time I've visited.   I've had bee sting wings, chicken cheese steak, the Eye-talian pizza, and buffalo fries to name a few. It's definitely worth a first and second trip. Pick up some fried Oreos before you leave."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to trying this place and finally made it there this past Saturday after a long day of shopping.  The staff is friendly and my pizza was GREAT!  Love the fresh jalapenos!  My daughter's pizza however was EXTREMELY greasy.  She had pepperoni and the grease literally ran down her arm and ultimately there was a PUDDLE of grease on her plate.  Not good.  The atmosphere is great and the beer was cold (although I had to go up to the bar twice to pick it up b/c my waitress kept forgetting to bring it to me.  I've been a waitress so I know things get hectic so it didn't bother me but it defiantly isn't something you want to ignore as an owner.   I'm planning to go back this week to try some other menu items.  I'm a HUGE buffalo hot wing lover so those for me will be the true test!"}
{"text":"I am in search of the perfect pineapple pizza. And The Rusty Onion's pineapple ham pizza is absolutely scrumptious. The crust is so fluffy an compliments the cheesy cheese, tasty tomato sauce, yummy ham, and juicy pineapple deliciously. It's a great size because I had enough to enjoy for the next day's lunch. I've had about 10 non-chain pineapple pizzas in the last year and this one is at the top. Whenever someone asks me what a few of my top pizzas are, Rusty Onion is the first restaurant I mention.  The atmosphere is really cool because it used to be a car shop I think, so the garage door can open up on nice days. When I went, it was a delightful evening and we sat outside on the patio. There was chill live music also. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been here couple times. The staff is really friendly and service is good. The pizzas are also good. was there on a trivia night...good amount of crowd on a weekday. Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I finally tried The Rusty Onion, after driving by it for a year. I called in a order for carry out and the owner answered the phone who was very friendly. I have tried almost every pizza place in Charlotte and there is a lot of good pizza to be found. I appreciate the differences in all of my favorite places, I just ordered a Pepperoni pizza because I am kind of a purist and really love the cheese, sauce and crust. This pizza had a great unique combination of chewy crust and cheese with very flavorful sauce. It was a little heavy on the sauce which is one of the things liked about it. The pepperonis where huge and tasted amazing. It was a good change from the pizza I usually eat. I look forward to trying the Great balls of fire pizza and wings next time.  The place was nice inside with a nice bar and good vibe. I like the garage door that leads outside to the patio and look forward to coming back and sitting outside."}
{"text":"I felt ignored when I walked into this place. I waited a while for someone to at least ask if I would like a drink of water or would I like a menu. When someone finally came up to me they asked me to give them a few more minutes.  HELLO may I have a menu please while I wait for you to return. Finally I had enough and left. . I would suggest they provide better customer service to \"ALL\".."}
{"text":"I've been twice in one week. The first time was a Monday night & it was delicious! I got the philly cheese steak with sweet potato fries & cannoli to go. It was the best meal ever!   I returned later that week, on Friday, to try the rusty onion app & get another philly. I was EXTREMELY disappointed second time around. Chips for app were burnt as were my fries & sub. I asked for no peppers but they still put red peppers - even seemed to notice the mistake before I left but still gave me the wrong sandwich. I'll give them another shot because the first time was so great but I was disappointed the second visit.  The staff are friendly but seem lost at times. I realize it's a new business but I feel like they need more experienced staff that want to help, not staff that keep trying to pass the buck. I sincerely hope they read & implement the reviews they receive because they could be GREAT! Perhaps they need my expertise... ;-)"}
{"text":"This place gets 2 stars only because they have a great beer list - otherwise forget it. We ordered a pizza and salad. The food was mediocre at best. And where on this earth are you CHARGED for cheese on a pizza, as if it's a topping and not an essential part of pizza! Since all you get for the base price is dough and sauce, it gets pretty expensive pretty fast when you add toppings at $.75 -$1.25 each. The sauce had no spices whatsoever; no oregano, no basil, no pepper - just tomato sauce. Could have been canned Hunt's' tomato sauce. Really??  We got pepperoni, onions, mushrooms and fresh mozzarella (we ordered mozzarella, they chose to put the more expensive fresh mozzarella on it) - it was all BLAND! Onions had no flavor and even the pepperoni lacked punch. The mushrooms were from a CAN!! Get real folks!   Ditto the salad. Lots of different greens, tomato, onion, cheese - how can you make that turn out flavorless? They just have a knack for sucking the flavor out of good food I guess.  One 10\" pizza, one side salad, 1 beer, 1 glass of wine  -  $36.53. Too pricey for me.  One other thing: they have lots of TVs so if you like sports bars....however, they had ALL of them on LOUD and not all the same game. Impossible to eat inside if you want conversation. Service isn't great either.  Won't go back & will caution others to stay away. Too bad because with a little tweaking and a chef with culinary skills it could be a good place."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Miranda tonight. Really enjoyed the live music too by Todd Murray. Pizza crust is perfection - crispy and buttery. The wings were meaty. I typically like then a bit saucier, but these were pretty good. I prefer carrots with my wings and they were able to accommodate my preference. The tiramisu was creamy and hit the spot after our meal. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about here but the people were so nice! They didn't have a lot of onion things on the menu which I thought was weird. We did get the onion rings which I personally was not a fan of. They were coated in a corn meal like seasoning and they were really really thick. I ended up peeling off most of it but the dip was really good!  The chicken wings, were great! The sauce was delicious too! I'm even pretty certain the ranch that came with the celery was house made.  We got take out and I think we were the only ones. The place was pretty full with people dining in. The lady that checked us out said we could also get delivery! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been coming to rusty since I moved to Charlotte. The food is excellent and the staff is even better. The normal bartender Holly is awesome. She is super friendly and will always have you laughing."}
{"text":"Gotta love the local bar with great local beers on draft and moderately priced bar food. Buffalo pizza is really good. I sub buffalo sauce for mild for an extra kick.   Bartender is super laid back and they always mix up the beers on tap. Right beside the office and home so PLEASE stay in business!    Only suggestion is to get some seafood on the menu: oysters, shrimp cocktail, something.. For when pizza and pasta is too heavy."}
{"text":"Can't evaluate anything but the pizza because we just did take out. The pizza is nothing to write home about. They offer something called a cheeseburger pizza, which is to be avoided at all costs - very gross. It seemed even to have pickles on it. Not a good flavor combo. We also ordered a standard cheese pizza, which was so- so. For the price, it has to be better. When they talk about how unique they are in the marketing materials, they must not be referring to their pizza (although I guess the cheeseburger pizza was uniquely disgusting- perhaps they mean that).   That being said, it looks like they have a cool beer selection and interior space, so may be worth going to eat there if the pizza itself isn't a big deal to you."}
{"text":"I have seen the sign for the Rusty Onion up for several months and was very excited to see that it finally opened. After reading several reviews we were a little hesitant to try it but chalked those poor reviews up to grand opening jitters. I'm glad we tried it out. I'm pretty sure the owner of the restaurant held the door open for us and welcomed us in. We were promptly seated and greeted but our super sweet waitress. We ordered a large pizza half mac & cheese and the other half Philly Cheesesteak. I really enjoyed my half of the mac & cheese. It was very flavorful and delicious. My husband enjoyed his Philly but suggested adding some A1 sauce.  The music was fun, the restaurant was clean and looked really nice, and service was great. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The place looks nice great patio but, The atmosphere is dull I tried to hang out and get comfortable but definitely not a place for that.Just grab a meal and go. They always manage to serve me under cooked fries which is an annoyance. The server was nice but it's just so boring there."}
{"text":"Specialty pizzas are amazing - and I'm normally a traditional pizza person. Even the lobster bisque was delicious! Lots of lobster. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Plenty of beers to choose from.  On a football Sunday, you can easily get a table.  My burger was VERY tasty and but a little extra greasy (it was their signature burger - The Rusty Onion Burger).  My boys had the pizza and a calzone, very healthy sized portions.  The bathrooms are clean.  Plenty of patio seating, but we chose to sit inside.  The bench that runs along one of the walls was an odd height in relation to the table so I felt like I was hunched over to eat. The service is a little slow, but I didn't mind the pace.  All in all it's a decent local bar/restaurant, convenient to my home, and I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Yum!!Take out Greek Salad & Eye Italian sub...Best Greek Salad Ive tasted in awhile~my daughter has raved about it now I know why. Service was quick & staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Finally a real Italian menu....best cheese steak this side of Pat's or Gino's......they got Wiz!    And the local beer selection washes it all down in style..... a new CLT landmark is born"}
{"text":"I know several customers that overheard the situation last night with the \"wing man\" review below. Needless to say his account of the event seems to serve his future fictional writing ambitions well.  I think this would be the same person that chooses to go to Costco and refuses to buy the full case but wants it for the full case price."}
{"text":"Along with the other reviews, we also waited and waited for the ONION to open.  We were hoping for good food and a fun bar to relax at close to home.  Well the bar part is great, the service is wonderful, the bartenders are great.  However the food really needs some help.  We have been there on 3 different occasions, the food was OK one time, and really not so good the 2nd and 3rd time. My boyfriend NEVER sends anything back, sent a pizza back.  They really need to work on adding flavor and being consistent.  We are hoping this is just a case of growing pains and the management and kitchen will figure it out.  Rusty Onion I hope you are reading your reviews, we really want to hang out there!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and some wings before the game. My bud ordered the pizza and wing special. Really good pizza! Watch out for the fresh jalapeños!! Definitely try the \"beesting\" wings!!! My Ass is on fire!"}
{"text":"Delicious garlic knots. Pizza was delicious... Could taste the fresh ingredients!   Service was excellent, great variety of beers on tap, and even had live music.   5 all around!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night so this review is based strictly on the food, not the service. We ordered two calzones, one pepperoni one sausage. When we got home we were EXTREMELY disappointed when we opened the boxes. The calzones were completely flat, with barely any cheese in them at all. On my pepperoni one almost half the calzone had no cheese on it whatsoever. Also the bread was hard as a rock, it hurt to bite into the parts that had no cheese. Needless to say we will not be back..."}
{"text":"Much better now that they changed the menu and added some favorites.  I didn't have much hope for the place when they first opened but now they have gotten their act together and the food and service is much, much better.  Recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Finally a great pizza place! I moved from NYC and have been searching from a pizza place for two years now! You have to try the calamari delicious. My husband and I were so impressed we had to compliment the owner and found out it was a family business. The owner is super friendly and originally from NYC! Love it!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner there on Saturday night.  The shrimp pasta special was awesome.  They really have a good selection of craft beers too.  The singer/guitar player they had added a special touch and I don't think he took a break during the 2.5 hours we were there.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"I've been here twice within days of opening.    The pizzas were great....We love the creative menu.  They Rusty Onion app is delicious, although it would be nice to have more toppings with the chips. Their version of the Philly cheese steak is excellent (have not tried it with the cheese whiz yet).  The tempura mushroom batter appetizer is delicious too. We also devoured the Canolis...mmmm. And oh yeah...The craft beer selection alone is worth coming out for by itself. The beer comes out at the perfect temperature for enjoying this kind of quality.  I have read some of the other reviews....In my experience, you cannot expect glitch free experiences the first week or so of a newly opened establishment,especially one pulling off a menu like this.....Not a franchise, but locally home grown restaurant.  Be patient people!    Fresh food, great beer and a very cool atmosphere make this a great destination."}
{"text":"Great pizza and apps.  The Rusty Onion was very good though could have used more onions.  Will defintely return.  Thiis was our first visit."}
{"text":"Gotta say- they nailed it. 5-star draft beer list, great atmosphere, strong offering for a menu. Weston was our bartender. Knowledgeable about the menu-and recommended a couple of appetizers.  For a Sunday night this place was perfect.  They closed at 10, but didn't rush us out.  Finally found a place that Carmel Road needed.  Looking forward to going back with the gents and exploring the beer menu a little further"}
{"text":"My friend and I  Ike to try new places so we checked this one out.  The weather was nice and they had the doors open to the patio.  The greeter was friendly and the server was attentive.  The problem was the food.  The French fries were very under cooked and greasy, no salt.  The garlic nots were missing garlic and were relatively greasy and under cooked also.  The marinara dipping sauce was fairly tasty.  My friends Philly cheesesteak was very greasy with very few onions and peppers on it.  She did find one mushroom.  I ordered the Italian sub with no onions.  After picking the onions off my sandwich I found the meats terribly dry and the vinaigrette dressing seemed to be missing until the very last few bite of the first half of the sub where I found the bread soaked in balsamic vinegar.  The server apologized and the manager came over and apologized also.  He did want to know what the food issues were,, hopefully so he could correct them.   Our food was free and he gave us a coupon for future use.  I really appreciate his concern and graciousness and I wish him luck in the future but if he doesn't get his kitchen straightened out, I believe his restaurant will be short lived."}
{"text":"Such a terrific craft beer and pizza place! Very cool place to hang out with friends and relax. We tried a local IPA and the cherry cider along with a white pizza which was delectable. I highly recommend giving it a try :)"}
{"text":"Good pizza at a decent price and the service was excellent. I especially want to thank the bar tender who saw my young son playing around with the Ms. Pac-man machine and gave him money to play the game. What a great gesture. I will come back just for the service and staff."}
{"text":"We noticed that this place had a nice patio and some live music so we decided to try it out. We enjoyed sitting outside but the food wasn't very good. My husbands burger was bland and overcooked. He also said the mushrooms on it weren't good. I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and it just didn't taste very good. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"All around good place for pub type food, full service bar and TV galore.  Fairly a kid friendly place with their own menu. Has an outside sitting area where a large garage type door rolls open to have a more open air feel to the restaurant. The wait staff are attentive and give this place an overall above average rating. Happy eating (and drinking too)."}
{"text":"Great food and sevice will be coming back again ... i went for lunch ... the food was good went back agian had drinks today i like there food one of my new favorite places to eat"}
{"text":"I had a great time. I hate that Ashley A. had a bad first experience, and truly hope that she will give this place a second chance. They might have had a rough start, but they definitely had their stuff together for the dinner rush.   We got there and saw a couple of chairs open at the bar and decided to head over there. As soon as we sat down the bartender came over, introduced herself and asked what we would like to drink and if we needed menus.   We ordered our appetizer while we sipped on our first beer - they have a nice selection to choose from by the way. When we got The Rusty Onion, we dug right in. It was a GREAT start to our meal. The caramelized onions, pita chips and sauce are a perfect combination, with just the right amount of spice. Shortly after getting our appetizer, we decided to go ahead and put in our dinner order.  We couldn't choose just one pie, so we got two personal sized (10\") pies - The Eye-talian Stallion and the Cheeseburger Dy-no-mite. I have been thinking of coming up with my own Italian sub-style pizza, before I really had the chance to do it on my own, BOOM! I find it at The Rusty Onion. The Eye-talian Stallion is exactly what I had in mind, plus some. The Kalamata olives and artichokes really make this pizza pop. The Cheeseburger Dy-no-mite is the perfect compromise if you can't decide whether you want a pizza or a burger, and it even comes complete with their special sauce drizzled over freshly-shredded lettuce. We couldn't have been happier with the choices we made.  The food all came out hot and timely. Our bartender was very attentive, without being intrusive to our evening, and we ended up staying for a few more rounds than we had planned.  This place is a must to put on your list of places to try. I am looking forward to trying out more items from their menu."}
{"text":"Love the bartenders here and I can always count on a warm welcome when I walk through the door. Seasonal beer selection is really good..lots of pumpkin beer to be had!"}
{"text":"Ate there last Friday, sort of a taste test to see what they offer, my first time. Had The Rusty Onion appetizer, fried/baked flatbread pieces, with a thick dipping mixture and marinated onions, both in very small containers hooked to the basket of bread. Not very good, bread overdone, difficult to get both sides on it, and neither side all that good. Also got the Buffalo Wings, which only come in HOT, although they do offer other types of wings aside from Buffalo style. They were very hot, but did have some flavor. Unfortunately, the wings right around the corner in the same plaza, at Flip N Chicken, are much better, and less money. I then ordered a main course, the Meatball Ravioli. 30 minutes later, without anyone ever serving me the ravioli, I got up, left a $20 to cover what I had eaten, and left. Very disappointing and I won't be back, nor will the people who were depending on my advance scouting to see if they wanted to try it. Not impressed with the menu variety at all. Carmela's Pizza, the restaurant that used to occupy that space, had great pizza and wings. Too bad they are no longer there."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Food is always good and priced right. Best chicken tenders in town. Kids love them as well as Mac N Cheese. Nice change for the area!! Also great place for outside dining."}
{"text":"Great spot for sports and food; pizza was delicious! We had garlic knots and an 18 inch pie, along with several excellent craft beers; all great. Service was excellent too. We will definitely be back!!! And the table next to us ordered chicken parm; the portion size was ENORMOUS!!!"}
{"text":"My main complaint is the RAW jalepenos on the pizza.  Why do some restaurants do this??? I'm sure someone out there likes it, but I think the majority of people prefer not to cry between bites of otherwise very bland pizza!  Please at least note on the menu that they aren't pickled!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place another try since we are so close, but this time we were there for lunch.  Kevin got the wings - half Italian, half buffalo.  This is the only reason I'm giving this 1 star, the wings were half decent, so I'm being generous with the star.  Italian was nothing like I've had, they were good! Buffalo were too spicy, and I usually get hot on wings, still good flavor.  I got the philly steak with onions, mushrooms, peppers, and provalone cheese. Huge disappointment, with all of those flavors, it was highly bland.  There was absolutely no flavor to the beef, reminded me of frozen shaved beef I can buy at the grocery store.  Service was annoying this time.  Maybe it was because they weren't busy, but the server was slow with her 4 tables and the hostess was helping out, so both checking on us.  Example: food arrives from bartender, she asks what we need, and we are good to go.  Server comes over and says well that looks yummy, I'll let you eat and I'll check on you later.  Eat a few bites, hostess comes by and checks on how things are going. Moments later server comes back and checks on us.  Moments later as we are still eating, server comes back and asks us about dessert, once we say no she goes away and comes back with check.  Really?? Chill out and let us enjoy our bland food.  I'm done giving this place a try.  Go to the other restaurants in this shopping center, they are 5 times better."}
{"text":"This was my husband and I first time attempting to dine here.  He suggested here because we pass it daily and admired the outdoor open sitting options. Upon arrival the host greeted and sat is immediately. It was not busy maybe 8 tables occupied in total.   Good sign so far.  About 2mins a waitress came and took our order.  We just wanted aan appetizer and 12 wings. The drinks came fast.. I ordered a martini which was delish! My husband a beer.   Then we waited 5 mins, 10 mins, 15 mins .. during this time 3 to 4 more tables were seated. 20 mins , still waiting on our little 12 wings. Waitress finally stops by and said, \"let me go check on your wing order\". I said thanks.. 28 mins still waiting for our wings but the other tables now have drinks and appetizers.  30mins my husband said, \"let's pay and leave,  this is ridiculous\". I found the waitress asked for the check.  She said, \"your wings are coming the ticket got lost\". Thank you,  but it's, now 35mins of waiting,  no thank you.  We paid her. As we reached the door she came out with wings saying they're ready now.  I just turned and we left.  Maybe this was just an off night.  I don't know.  But unsure if we'll visit again."}
{"text":"Don't quite understand the poor reviews.   I thought everything was really good.   Homemade ranch dressing is to die for.  Wings are perfect. .. And I know as I am from Buffalo.  Amazing."}
{"text":"1st off I've been to the Rusty Onion a number of times as its close to my office. The food is good. I'm on a special diet right now which limits what I can eat (no fries onion rings ect.) I asked for a heathy side , fruit or something like that. The only item they offered was a salad at a 2.50 up charge. I asked what they charge for sides normally and was told 4.00 I was transferred 3 times finally speaking with a man who said he was the owner. I explained my diet situation and asked if in place of a side I could not eat if I could get a unsweet tea instead. ( cost to him probably a NICKLE) he went into this long story about food cost and would not accommodate a regular customer. I was pretty shock by his stance in a customer based business. I did not appreciate the treatment and did not order the 10.00 item I was planning on. So he loses a sales over a NICKLE item and LOSES a customer for now. Shame on you RUSTY ONION way to many options for this type of NON Customer Service. I'm sure they will be long gone soon. PM"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant tonight with a friend for dinner, I ended up ordering what was on special which was the \"Chicken Santorini pasta\"  The lemon cream sauce was so tasty!  Truly a hit!  Our waiter, Andrew, was a delight!  He played the dish up very descriptive,  sold it to me!  He told us what the special was for the evening, very attentive and friendly.   I ended up eating my leftovers, allowed my brother to taste it, he couldn't believe how good it was!  Thank you and I will see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Great Service.  Excellent local beer selection.  The food is really good"}
{"text":"We went last night and each got salads and pizzas, beer & wine. Their ranch is definitely a winner - it would also taste great for dipping French fries.  My boyfriend got the Great Balls of Fire pizza, and thought it was good but wanted more meatballs on it, or bigger pieces of meatball. I got the Shroomin Fun Guy pizza which I thought was the best pizza I have had in years!!  Carmelized onions, goat cheese, arugula, mushrooms. They top it with white truffle oil, and they don't skimp on it like most places do. The flavors of this pizza are amazing. The service was attentive and the manager(?) also came and checked on us, too. Oh - and we took home a (homemade) meatball sub for my daughter and all agreed it was VERY good. We will definitely be frequenting this great neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Drinks are good. But food is not good. And there was a couple arguing in the parking lot. I know that's not their fault but. The food is not good. Maybe the pizza is we didn't try that."}
{"text":"Great place for dining informally with friends. There are seating accommodations inside at tables, bar or high tops as well as patio seating. Bright and cheery atmosphere with variety of menu items. Pizza is exceptionally good with a lunch menu offering a slice  with a salad. The food was served in a timely manner and beverages were refilled often. Prices seemed very reasonable. Wait staff was efficient and attentive. Premises including restroom were very clean and we'll stocked."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good!  Good brew selection too.  Ordered a build your own pizza that came to $30.  One ingredient was $4 as a topping. Smoked gouda.  I asked why it wasn't told to me that it wasn't $1.75 and the mgr told me \"prices are subject to change \".  Then said \"Gouda prices are high right now and we smother the pie with it\".  BS: do you see it smothered on the pie?  L"}
{"text":"First time here - no need to go back.  At all.  I don't know where to begin with my review! First of all, it was just me and my daughter for lunch.  The first thing I noticed was that EVERYTHING on the lunch menu was priced at $12 and up.  In order to keep our lunch tab below $25, we decided to order from the app menu.  Let me tell you first WHAT we ordered, and then I'll come back to HOW it tasted:  cheese fries and bacon bits, an order of SIX wings (yes, just six), one diet coke (that we split), and one piece of cake.  Total of our bill? $27.50.  I'm sorry, but come on!  The fries were laughable: they were simply fries with BACOS (the fake bacon that you shake out of a jar) and Cheez Wiz.  I swear.  Cheez Wiz.  The orange, gross, thick fake Cheez Wiz.  The wings were tiny - and they charged $7.00 for a plate of SIX wings.  To add insult to injury, there were shriveled, anemic looking carrots and celery as a \"side\" to the wings.  We tried to make up for our terrible lunch experience by ordering something called Chocolate Spoon Cake.  Again....a pretty tiny piece, which was really nothing more than a hard chunk of overly-sweet fudge - for $6.50.  Unbelievable.  I try not to give overly bad or mean reviews - I realize that all restaurants have bad days from time to time.  But this one really ticked me off, because the food quality was cheap and poor, and it was abundantly clear that this is one of the MANY, MANY, MANY Charlotte restaurants that thinks they can charge ridiculous prices because of the zip code - for below-adequate food.  (I mean come one....Cheez Wiz?)  Shameful.  I will definitely not go back - and would recommend to others that you not waste your money even trying it.  Overall, I think Yelpers in Charlotte need to raise their own personal bars - because I see lots of 3's and 4's (stars) restaurants on here - when my own experience with the restaurant is a 1 or 2 at best."}
{"text":"So, I really want to LOVE this place.  Unfortunately, I don't.  My husband and I have been here twice.  Once for drinks, another time dinner and beers.      Let's start with the positives (and why I will be going back and giving it another try):   1.  The beer selection is great.  They have so many local craft brews on tap, it's wonderful!  With that said, there are a few places in the area with an equally great, or better, beer selection (Duckworth's, Mellow Mushroom) and better food.   2.  The decor inside is awesome.  They have these really cool lampshades that are painted with the local Charlotte Brewery's logos.  They are very cool.   3.  The staff is very friendly, maybe a little too friendly.  While nice is great, my husband, our friend and I must have been interrupted no less than 15 times during our dinner by various people asking us if everything was OK.  That said, it was their second week open and I understand being overstaffed and it's your new job.  If the manager tells you to go around and check on tables, that's what you do, but it was overkill. 4.  The onion rings were yummy.  Now the not so great: 1.  As mentioned above: Too many people interrupting our meal. 2.  Single bathroom.  I know this may be out of the owner's control, but I hate when a bar/restaurant has just one bathroom.  This means you are always, more often than not, waiting outside.  Waiting outside at this place means waiting in a narrow hallway where servers are coming in and out of the kitchen, it's just awkward. 3.  Our food was not good.  They are a pizzeria, we had two separate servers tell us that the cheeseburger pizza tastes, \"Just like a Big Mac\".  It didn't.  It was flavorless and the crust was not fantastic.  For me, the crust makes the pizza...this was blah.  With all of that said, my husband and I will go back.  I will try something other than their pizza.  Our friend said their pasta was good.  I hope to give a more positive update after our next trip!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty laid back place that's good for a night to just hang out. There was live music that was pretty good and the food was decent. I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza, and although it wasn't the greatest BCP I've had (that award goes to a place in Nashville) it was very good. For an appetizer it was the Rusty Onion, and to be honest it wasn't much more than some pieces of flatbread with onions and sauce on top (but the sauce was very good). It was fairly typical bar food but I have no complaints.   Except they charged me for a small cup of ranch.  I'll give it a 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance and have been wanting to walk over with my two dogs since they supposedly have a dog-friendly patio as it states in a post on their Facebook page back in June when they were determining the patio status. So, yesterday me with my two small dogs and a friend with his dog walked over to sit on the patio and have a few beers. Well, they are not dog-friendly on the patio to our disappointment, which is the only reason we tried the restaurant. We agreed to tether our dogs to the fence railing right outside the patio gate and sit at the table right by the gate. All was OK and we decided to try the pizza. Before finishing, the manager (I think) who allowed us to tether the dogs by the gate entry to the patio came out and said the owner was in and very upset about the dogs. Anyway, long story short...  The beer selection is awesome. Our service was wonderful -- Victoria. The pizza was fairly good but too pricey for what it is. ($22.50 for a 16\" specialty pizza, for example)  I doubt we patronize the restaurant much more because the attractive feature for us was the dog-friendly patio. It's a shame as there are many responsible dog owners in the area who would walk over and enjoy the patio.  Dec. 11, 2013: Decided to try this restaurant again. I was pleased to see they have brought the insanely high former specialty pizza prices down to a reasonable level of 10\" $10, 14\" $14, 18\" $18...and it's nice to have three size choices now instead of only 10\" and 16\". It was also nice they allowed me to do a half and half pizza choice on a 14\" to try two of their specialties.  I would still go here far more often if they were dog-friendly on the patio. The Mexican restaurant a few doors down allows dogs on their patio so they get most of my business in the area. I got various reasons at The Rusty Onion of why they changed their dog-friendly policy with one person saying any restaurant that serves food cannot allow dogs on the patio. Completely false, as I told him. There's a plethora of restaurants in Charlotte that allow dogs with their owners -- that's good business and definitely brings in more money for the proprietor!  http://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/city/charlotte_nc_us/"}
{"text":"We are back! This visit was much better than the last time. While my husband and I enjoyed our food and drinks, my brother and his girlfriend had a rougher night with their orders. There was a new bartender who was struggling to make a decent mojito and they volunteered to be her guinea pigs. After 3 attempts, though, they switched to beer. The manager took the mojitos off of their bill. She made a tasty cherry rum and coke, though. A little too much ice, but she's learning. Next came the food. They ordered the cheeseburger dynamite pizza and did not enjoy it. They tried to play it off while being honest with our waitress. Soon after, a manager came over and insisted they order another pizza or sandwich because he \"wouldn't let them \"eave with a bad taste in their mouths\".  While tonight was an off-night for half of our table, the service was amazing. It blew us away.   Our server's name was Sheldon and I highly recommend her. She was a lot of fun and handled everything really well while still having fun with us.   Summary: amazing service, food was a large improvement over last time, and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent wings, great beer! Staff was knowledgable and friendly. Would most certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Finally found this place...and glad I did!! The drink specials are a deal and the food plentiful! I also found the staff pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Food. Drinks. Pizza.  Strombolis. And even desserts.  Live music, too.  This place should be more crowded than it is.  Love it."}
{"text":"Did a small taste testing for lunch today to get a feel for the menu. Had the Buffalo wings, which only came in Hot (no less spicy options) which I think is a mistake. Good flavor, but Flip N Chicken, in the same shopping center has better and more options. However, while hot as promised, pretty good if too hot for most people (in my opinion). Then had The Rusty Onion appetizer, which wasn't very good. Flatbread chips, and a small amount of dip with another small serving of Carmelites onions. Perhaps if served differently I might like it better, but as is, disjointed and difficult to combine the three ingredients. if this is a Signature piece, it needs to be revised considerably. Finally, ordered the Meatball Ravioli, waited 30 minutes, never came. Left $20 to cover what I ate and left. Not very promising, won't be back."}
{"text":"Ehh- Not impressed but not repulsed. Average bar with average (semi-overpriced) food. . Patio looks cool but has always been empty when we stop by. Drink specials are minimal.  Last time, my sister and I ordered a Pineapple Upside Down shot. Keep in mind, this normally taste like sweet pineapple deliciousness.... ours however tasted like an odd combination of Butterscotch and ... well, just butterscotch. It was awful. We only took a tiny sip since the smell was so off in the beginning. I asked the server what in the world was in this shot because it did NOT taste right and I didn't want it. She asked what it taste like- I said Butterscotch. She went and asked the bartender what was in the shot (they had a long convo) and she finally came back and told me it had like vodka, pineapple juice, butterscotch liqueor and something else (it was random whatever it was). And then she immediately explained how they can't do anything about the shots if we don't like them, but I could order another one. Ummm, no thanks sweetie, if your bar puts butterscotch in shots like that, I don't think I will like the rest of your concoctions lol.  Maybe one day down the road, when I'm tired of all the other places around me and happen to get a coupon for this place, I may go back... but only for pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here on numerous occasions and the food is great! From the buffalo chicken salad to the humongous portions of pizza slices. The pizza is made in house, which I love, and it has just the right amount of salty touch. I also like that it's not overly crowded and tucked away in a great spot."}
{"text":"Do you giggle like a 16 year old boy every time you see/hear The Rusty Onion?  I know I do.  I am not sure why it sounds like it belongs in a dirty joke, but whatever.   I had seen varying reviews on Yelp, knew it was a new place to try and I needed to get fuel at the Exxon near it, so I figured I might as well try it out.  Located in the pretty recently renovated Carmel Commons shopping center, on the Carmel Rd side near Great Wall of China South, the signage makes it pretty easy to spot.  At 5:30 on a Wednesday night, the eating crowd was light, but the bar was about half-full.  Several large TV's were in various places.  The restaurant has wooden tables chairs, high top tables with wooden chairs and seating at the bar.  They also had several iron tables and chairs on the patio, but July in Charlotte isn't always prime outdoor seating.  I also noticed that there is a big roll up door at the front of the restaurant - maybe for some fresh air when it gets cooler and doesn't rain every stinking day.  It was a nice looking place (I have never been to this location in any of it's previous iterations), but as with every new restaurant I have been to recently, it has finished concrete floors and an open ceiling which makes it LOUD - I mean deafening loud (which could be a sign I am getting old).  There were 3 tables seated and maybe a dozen people at the bar and I couldn't hear myself think.  I could only imagine on a night full of drunks and/or kids - eesh.    I had looked at the menu online prior to going and knew I wasn't going to pay $7 for 6 wings.  From another review, the app The Rusty Onion didn't seem to be worth the price either (though their apps were priced for what the going rate of most are around town).  Salads and sandwiches seemed to be reasonably priced.  Specialty pizzas are $13.50 for a 10\" or $22.50 for a 16\" (which made me cringe, that is higher than I have seen at Hawthorne's, Libretto's, etc.).  I wasn't terribly hungry, so I just went with a build-your-own pizza which starts at $9.50 and then sky-rockets per topping from there.  I just got a plain old white/garlic & EVOO sauce with mozzarella on it.   The pizza crust was fantastic!  The last two pizzas I have had from other places (white pizzas, I like white pizzas, less indigestion...) seemed to be the new standard of a crust that tastes burned.  I don't like that.  This crust was substantial, just slightly thicker than thin, with a good bite/crunch to it that held up well to the very last bite with no flop at all.  I was a big fan of the pizza and would gladly go back to try more.  For a basic build-your-own cheese pizza (no toppings) and water to drink, my tab was just over $10.  The service was fine, I had no issue with waiting an inordinate amount of time for my pizza at 5:30 - it actually got to the table pretty darn fast and it was smoking hot.  My water was kept filled and my waitress was pleasant.  Aside from it being very loud with some items a little on the pricy side, I would definitely return for the pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in a while! So glad we tried this place. Will for sure be returning. Also the spoon chocolate cake is to die for!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live right across the street, and after months of driving by and commenting how we should try the Rusty Onion, we finally pulled the trigger last night! We split the Rusty Onion app, he got the Eye-talian sandwich with fries, and I got the Portobello Pie with the house salad (also came with bread). I loved my meal- it was unique, delicious, and filling! He loved the fried but wasn't crazy about the sandwich- said it was salty but it could have been because of the Italian meats which can tend to be salty. The app was delicious- sauteed onions and a garlicky cream sauce over toasted pita bread- I could have eaten that pita bread all night! Yum. Overall we left happy and are planning to go back to try more of their menu. The total for our meal was $38 including tip."}
{"text":"Service starting out was slow,  but our server made up for it and was very attentive.   We got the entree house salad and Greek pizza.  The salad was,  we'll a simple salad.   A bit pricey,  but fresh.   The ranch dressing is very thick and creamy.  Very yummy.   The Greek pizza was perfect!  Crust was crispy and thin.   No soggy anywhere on this bad boy.   Feta cheese, tomatoes, kalmota olives, banana peppers and mozzarella cheese on a garlic extra Virgin olive oil base.   Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Friday...not too busy ....service was good...only thing I can find less than favorable are the the cheddar bacon fries.... Tasted like canned cheese and (red ) imitation bacon bits...with undercooked cold fries... Fried Pickles were awesome and chicken wings were tasty ! Will definitely go back just know not to order those again...."}
{"text":"Ok, they would get more stars if the wings were larger. They make their dressings in house and they taste great.  Wait staff is wonderful, love talking to them and service is stellar. Mac and cheese is excellent, so bring the kids. Ordered the cannoli, there small ones, great snack! Cream is made in house, very good but take it from an Italian...crush up pistachio and dip ends in. Add chocolate chips :) I would go back again to try pizza and home made bahklava."}
{"text":"The food is okay , I like there pizza and there gyro . I thought there nachos where to salty and there water for some reason always taste funny . But there ice tea is good . There staff is okay the first time I been there the waitress was very nice. The  other time  I was there the waitress I had was nice but kind of ditsy."}
{"text":"I'm sure I will need to update this review in a few weeks when we visit the restaurant again.  We went on one of their first nights open, and I believe that you have to be patient with a restaurant that just opened!   We live close by and have been watching the space anticipating the opening.   Great little pizza place with tons of TVs and local beers on draft.  The pizza options were awesome....there are a bunch on their menu I can't wait to try.  I ordered the cheeseburger pizza this time - it was good.    Our main problem was the appetizer we ordered was nothing like how it was described on the menu.....it was missing the spinach and pesto, plus they added salsa to the bread instead of bruschetta, yuck!   But after bringing it to the manager's attention, they fixed this and brought us a new one.  I would think that they would have removed this item from our bill, but it was still on there."}
{"text":"The Rusty Onion is in an awesome location and has a great vibe to it. The Monday draft beer special is unbeatable also.  We got the Rusty Onion appetizer and it was awesome! Wish there was more on the plate. We had pasta, salad, and pizza. Every category of food has a cool take on the traditional and also traditional choices. Overall, the food was great!  The owner came by the table and she was very nice. We'll definitely be coming back, especially Mondays!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in south Charlotte! My favorite is the Presto Pesto with blackened chicken. Love their wings too!! Great service too, love the bartender Holly!"}
{"text":"First time here today on a Saturday! Atmosphere was laid back & inviting. Food was excellent! We ordered wings and got both barballo & honey BBQ.. which were both excellent! Also ordered the meat lovers Stromboli which was perfect!  Our server Ashtyn was very sweet & attentive! So glad we found this place as we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great for TVs if you want to watch more than one game at a time.   The service is average to bad sometimes. The food is always good to average, not much of a salad selection, if you're really into that. Beer selection is not my favorite, but they do have many to choose from. The pizza is good, I don't recommend the garlic knots. There are a lot of them, but they don't have much flavor."}
{"text":"Took one of our friends from Lancaster here and enjoyed watching his first time here.  He made the comment that a place with this kind of beer selection with mediocre food would be worth the trip and so would one with this kind of food with plain beer but getting both was amazing.  Lol, that was why me and the wife took him to our favorite neighborhood place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have always been pleased with the service and most of the food. It's a cute place with a friendly atmosphere although the name is a little weird.  Most of the time I sit out on the patio but I have spent a night at the bar and another night dining inside.   The Noble Cider they have on tap is amazing. It's a tart cherry flavor with a decent alcohol content so be careful!  Get the Tuscany bread it will not dissapoint you. Really the only thing that would is the calamari-- just not impressive...."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends. A nice patio area, friendly,helpful staff and hands on management"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Saturday at 9pm. Moping floors around us, empty drinks for 10 min. No sign of management anywhere."}
{"text":"The pizza here is so amazing. My s.o and I had the Bianca and it was full of flavor. They have a really great beer selection too. The bartender was very interactive. They do not just play one football game .. they attend to everyone who wants to see a certain game. They had a live musician there when we went and it was awesome background music. They have a huge area for outdoor seating which is great for Charlotte because we have wonderful weather here."}
{"text":"We liked the look of this new pizza place! The Rusty Onion appetizer was very good but overpriced for what it was. We ordered the Eye-talian Stallion pizza. The toppings were very good and plentiful but my family thought the crust was a bit dry and flavorless. The staff was very friendly. We'll give this new restaurant another try soon!"}
{"text":"Solid option.  Great service, hope this persists after the \"newness\" has worn off.  Broad menu though I did go with pizza which was great.    I had been a regular Brooklyn Pizza guy but think Rusty Onion will be my new go-to spot.   Went for work lunch so couldn't sample any of the extensive draft beers offered but will definitely return for dinner.  Amazing beer list."}
{"text":"Our first stop in Charlotte! Friendly spot, locals were nice, and the pizza was amazing! Highly recommend this pizza, trust me if you like Sausage, Bacon, Ham, Pepperoni, the HOT CARNIVORE is what you want! I also had a local craft beer called Hop Drop & Roll - it was a little bitter so I give it 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"Decent Italian food, very nice bar.  You can do a lot worse than this place."}
{"text":"This place looks much better on the inside than out!  Good pizza (they offer pizza by the slice at lunch) but the menu is a bit over priced.   Pretty good TV coverage so it could be a decent watering hole in South Charlotte!  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I decided to go back to The Rusty Onion today, and I was quite impressed. My boss went earlier this afternoon and was astonished by how good of a time he had there (after about 3-4 of his own terrible lunch trips to The Rusty Onion), and he recommended that I try it. He was so certain that my experience would be a good one that he said he would pay for my meal if it went otherwise.  My server was Cory and she was well versed in the specials and was very sweet. Eric and the hostess came by a few times to make sure that my food was good as well. Overall, the service was EXCELLENT! The food was delicious as well! I finally had the experience I had hoped for since they first opened. Can't wait to try the gluten free pizza next time. If you've had a bad experience at this restaurant, I definitely recommend giving it a second try."}
{"text":"Went last night with my family. Kid-friendly, great pizza, great service, and good beer list.  The manager and staff were very friendly and said they will be starting Trivia on Thursdays and are open late for the late-night crowd. I see this becoming a popular place very quickly."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Grabbed food from here the other day. Need to go back and try their pizza. Had the wings which were pretty good."}
{"text":"I was really impressed when we walked into the Rusty Onion. They must have put a lot of money into renovating the space - it looks great (no idea how it used to look tho).  We sat at the bar for a couple drafts and to share a pizza. They have a good selection of Charlotte & NC beers at a great price, score! We started with the Greek Salad - it was really big and the dressing and ingredients were A-OK (except for the dried cranberries, that threw me off). For our pizza, we shared the Great Balls of Fire - a meatball pizza with tomatoes and red peppers. We ordered ours with banana peppers instead. All-in-all the ingredients were fresh, but everything about it was just bland. Almost like the dough needed some salt or something?   The bartenders were fairly \"green\" but they did check on us, we just got the vibe that the restaurant hired a lot of inexperienced people.  Overall, we liked the Rusty Onion, but I doubt we'll be back. Definitely not my favorite pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great food. The meatballs are excellent!! I have been here multiple times and have never had a bad meal.  The reason for the 3 stars is the atmosphere at night.  The live music is WAY too loud. We don't come here very often because of the music.  It is so loud you can't talk to the person next to you. Please Please stop the music! ! Your restaurant would be so much nicer!"}
{"text":"Thursday lunch splurge - onion rings and pizza. I have never found onion rings that come remotely close to South 21's, but these were pretty great! I had a small \"Shroomin' Fun Guy\" pizza. Great crust, lots of flavor in the mushrooms, carmelized onions and spinach. We sat near the kitchen, so saw all the big plates of food coming out. Huge sandwiches and salads and beautiful pizzas. Impressed and will be back."}
{"text":"Saw the sign driving by several times and so I met 6 friends there for lunch the other day. Now they promote themselves as \"The Best NY style Pizza\" in Charlotte but it is much more than that. The menu is extensive with Pizza, sandwiches, salads and the traditional italian fare. I did have the Pizza special which was 2 giant slices, with everything on it, small salad and a drink for $8.95!  It was very good pizza and I took one slice home in a box. My friends all commented that the food was delicious, huge portions and they felt it Beat our regular spot for NY style Pizza. The other benefit was that it has tons of seating available, easy handicap access which was important to us, outdoor seating and an upbeat Hostess. One other benny was the Bar, they have like 50 beers and ales to choose from,  ain't nothing better than a good slice with your favorite beverage....we will be back soon cause I want to try the Sausage Stromboli....my bud said it was Great!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place NO stars but you can't if you want to write a review!!!! Had a friend visiting from out of town and our other friends wanted to meet up there it was my first and last time EVER there. I ordered a apple martini with absolut once it arrived it just tasted like apple sour I told the waitress I'm sorry I just didn't like it mind you I took a tiny sip so tiny it looked like I never drank it our waitress took it back and some lady said WE can't take it back all of our liquor is measured by five counts and I had to pay for it!!! WTF was that suppose to mean I just wanted my drink replaced and minus the lesson in drink Making I know how a martini should taste!!! So NEVER mind the customer was not satisfied I asked for the manager she said there wasn't one I gave her the 8.00 that she desperately needed we left and went to CHAR BAR 7 where the service was AWESOME!!!!! Sad when it's all about the count and not their customer you will NEVER get my friends or family money in your restaurant and the owner can thank the fake manager and horrible bartender on Saturday 11/18/16!!!!!"}
{"text":"My review here is based entirely off of a single lunch experience which consisted of a pizza covered in Mac and Cheese.  I feel confident with these 5 stars.  Now, I know what you're thinking, that a Mac and Cheese pizza is going to be some bar food hastily tossed together because people love mac and cheese, but this stuff is legit.  The sauce is creamy and awesome, and it's just covered edge to edge in melted cheese.  Is it good for you?  No, it is not, but you should have known that from its name.  You're not here to eat healthy.  You're here to eat a pizza covered in macaroni and cheese.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Came here for Trivia with a few friends last Thursday. The menu looked pretty good so I was looking forward to eating here.  I ordered the pickle fries as an appetizer. Pretty good! I like that it was different from the usual fried pickles appetizer and the aioli was yummy.  As my entree I ordered the portabella pie. I was expecting a large portion, as it was listed under entrees, and the description made it sound like a portabella cap stuffed, much like a stuffed mushroom appetizer that I am familiar with. However, when the plate arrived, it was a bit smaller than anticipated. I was glad that I had a salad to help fill me up. The taste was great, so if you are interested in a smaller dinner, this is a good option.   My group ordered drinks, and they came out mostly okay - we had a few mix ups that perhaps could have been avoided. For example, I ordered white wine and my friend across the table ordered champagne. But the servers brought out 2 glasses of white wine. When I got my check, there was a drink on there that I hadn't ordered. I know we all get mixed up sometimes, but taking care of the little details would have made our experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we just had to try this place out.....in a word.....fantastic.   The good was great and the ambiance was just what you would expect from a name like the Rusty Onion.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the (not overpowering) live music was a great touch.  I strongly recommend going"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my family tonight. The rusty onion was delicious!! Everything was great. Service was good and friendly also. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We love the Rusty Onion! We usually go on Tuesday or Friday when hey have live music and it's great! The pizza is DELICIOUS, thin but substantial crust(I hate floppy pizza). The owners, Jimmy and Maria are always there and come by to say hi which creates a very personal experience! The bar tenders Holly and Ivan are so great! I never even have to ask for anything! They know what we like and make sure we have it! It's a great place that you will absolutely love going to!!"}
{"text":"Just not a fan of their pizza . Good service and good atmosphere , lots of tvs - I imagine would be a good spot for football. But just disappointed in the pizza ! The mushroom goat cheese had no flavor at all. Unfortunately I might come back for  beer  but not for the food"}
{"text":"Our lunch group from the workplace makes this a common stop! The first few times it was frustrating because we went well over our allotted one-hour lunch time due to the fact they are typically pretty busy for lunch - especially on any given Friday.  After a few conversations with the owner, who knew other folks from our dealership, clued us in on an easier process. We now call ahead as soon as we leave - typically always sticking with the one slice o' pie, side salad and cold beverage lunch special - it will be arriving to our table about the same time we are. Bravo! Now that's a well done work lunch.  Speaking of the aforementioned lunch special: damn, that's tasty! Every day they pick a different specialty pie and then you pick a caesar or garden salad and your choice of soda or tea. Last step: Enjoy! Simple as that.  BeeTeeDubs: I have yet to spot a rusty onion on any of my pies...  Don't forget the good beer specials throughout the month as well... Saluti!"}
{"text":"Really big fan of this place! I lived across the street pretty muc and had my fair share of their different menu items. One of the best things I can say about this place was when you couldn't get wings ANYWHERE else in town on Super Bowl Sunday, The Rusty Onion had my back! I picked up an order of 50 wings which were great and didn't have to tough any crazy crowds!  If you are looking for a solid choice for dinner give this place a try you shouldn't be let down."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for a second time. My neighbors love this place and wanted to get some pizza to go. Delivery was about 45 mins, not bad at all. We got a classic cheese pizza and it was delicious. It wasn't greasy and had the right amount of cheese. We also tried something different- the Italian stallion. It was a white pizza with salami and artichokes. It was delicious and different. Overall, this place is pretty good!!  They also do trivia on thursdays."}
{"text":"Slow service with very few other patrons. Hard to make extra money when getting the first beer to the table takes more than 10 minutes.  I had the boneless wings and the chicken was dry and just bland. The portion was large however. My friend had the fried chicken sandwich which was just ok.  Menu was typical bar food with what looked to be good pizza. Might go back for the pie."}
{"text":"Delicious !!!! Two times I've been there the staff has been very helpful and recommended great appetizers. Great place defiantly recommend it and will go back!!"}
{"text":"Solid experience before a movie last weekend. Live music on the weekend was a plus. Calzone was tasty, marinara delicious and homemade. Good beer selections and make sure to check the specials."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try and ordered a large pizza to go. We were able to do half & half of two different kinds of their specialty options... Even though it look good & smelled good it was so disappointing... The dough was hard and chewy.  I picked it up and the drive home was about 15min. When I got home it was a bit cold but warm enough to eat but like I said the dough was chewy and hard. So we warm it up but it made it worst... Crust was hard as a rock and we had to pull on every bite :-/ ... May try again or may not ... The staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"The service, ambiance and food all make a statement of what this restaurant is all about. Amazing!   They of course serve \"bar type food\" but I would argue that it's way better than most of the chain restaurants. Point is, give  it a try!"}
{"text":"Below average! Nothing impressive at all, very poor service, plain flavorless hamburger with cold canned mushrooms, too much mustard and cold bun- better burgers at home by far. Frozen onion rings that were really embarrassing to see being served at a restaurant. Place was less than half full at 7:30 on Friday.  I do not recommend, and will not go back."}
{"text":"Went to the Rusty Onion for the first time tonight. We had an amazing appetizer called The Rusty Onion, highly recommend it!  I had the California Chicken Sandwich and Sweet Potato fries for my entrée.  Delicious!!  I will be going back and I would absolutely recommend it!  Great prices, great service, great food!!"}
{"text":"The bartenders are always Moody, bathrooms are always nasty, the pizzas is so so,  the mystery beer specials are hit or miss depends if staff chilled the beer, lots of beer on tap ???? if they have them, seems to be a lot of drama at the place, I have been at the place at least 3/5 times, so i have gave it time to get it their sh... together"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch while I was working in Charlotte and the building has a really nice atmosphere, typical pizza/bar vibes with a dozenish tvs all turned to various sports.   I was there with three coworkers between us we had the special of the day pizza (which I can't recall because I had pepperoni), cheese and pepperoni pizza and a salad and the food was excellent and made in a proper brick oven.   We were the only ones there (it was only 11am) so the service was very fast. The beer selection looked good. I say looked because work frowns on me drinking on the clock.   Nothing extraordinary but definitely a nice spot to grab some pizza or watch the game."}
{"text":"Ok. I would like to say the food is good, not great. I ordered a calzone and the rusty onion app. The app was not worth the money. The best part of the calzone was the cheese. They have a nice open patio, but the interior decor could use an update. This place is loud! Too loud. Stay away if you don't like children. There are tons running around. The service was terrible. The server kept touching me, calling me nicknames, walking away in the middle of my order. She kept making jokes and was very unprofessional. Trivia night is Thursday, so it gets even louder inside. I might come back, but this is not a place I would frequent."}
{"text":"I have been to the onion several times and love it.The pizza crust has a buttery flavor that is second to none.You have to try the \"eye\"talion stallion.It is the best pizza I have ever tasted.The staff is friendly and efficient.It has a great bar and local beers."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our time here, and will be back. From the time we walked in, to the moment we left, it was a great experience.   We ordered the Carnivore Pizza and Chicken Parmesan. Y'all. The Caesar Salad was crisp, crunchy (croutons), savory (shaved parmesan), and the dressing was as it should be. Sometimes the little things make all the difference, and that was the case here.  Pizza was hot, and meaty, and the chicken Parmesan was clearly prepared fresh, not some warmed up frozen block.    Plenty of beer on tap and a friendly crowd of patrons, give it a shot fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"First, I want to start with my favorite thing about this place is the atmosphere. I went here for lunch on a Thursday and they were busy! The bar was almost full! So that was a great sign!  It's a pizza joint but with a local craft feel. I ordered the Greek salad and it was delicious! I could have done without the cranberries but it was still good! I then ordered the pepperoni pizza by the slice and it was HUGE!  One with a salad was all that I needed for lunch.  I want to go back and have a beer soon! Possibly a happy hour?!?!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Rusty Onion a few time now since opening.  I know that the first day is not as good as when the kinks get worked out. My first trip the food was OK.  I had my family there and we all ordered different things from the menu.   My pizza was bland as others had said in the early days of opening, but after I responded to the restaurant owner about what had happened, he and his staff were open to listen to what happened to me and quickly looked to correct the problem at hand.   I went back and got a pizza, and I have to tell you that it was Excellent. My test came when i finally had a chance to have the pizza, 1 hour after I picked it up... If a pie is good an hour later, you know IT'S GooD !....  Now, The owner is a family friend, and I am not writing this as a favor, but I have been honest with him since day one that I have known him... He honestly looks to make every patrons experience special...   I went back on my lunch hour last week, and had the Cheese Steak sandwich... It was really good... I think the mark of someone that wants to be proactive in his business is when after I was done, I was able to call him up and give him suggestions to make it even better... That's what Jimmy is capable of doing...  I look forward to many more nights dining @ the Rusty Onion as it continues to improve...   PS... 11 local NC Beers on Draft and how many more in bottles, makes for a great watering hole..."}
{"text":"Do you want to hear the same song multiple times while eating?   If you like Guns and Roses then this is the place for you!  I've been here three times now because it's close by... I won't be giving them another shot. The food is as generic. Worse than generic. It's bad generic food.   Meh.  With that being said... my S/O loves this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the Rusty Onion this past Friday and I was not impressed...  We found this place online and despite some prior bad reviews we decided to check it out. We came in for a quick bite and a beer. Food was mediocre at best, beer selection was OK but not what you would expect from a place that claims to be a pour house. There were servers just sitting around at tables...we had to wait about 10 min for the bartender to show up and no one offered us a menu or a drink.  When the bartender did finally show up she stunk like cigarettes and had a very unprofessional appearance. She gave minimal service... The entire staff was crowded around one end of the bar talking amongst themselves it took 3 tries just to get our check so we could leave!  I defiantly won't be recommending it to friends and we will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pizza was ready in time, (i picked up)staff was super friendly. Good ambiance. Tasty and as described"}
{"text":"This place it's cool. I would love to have a girls night or a couple date night here. The food is delicious. The wings are crispy and hot. But not dry. There's a great selection of food. From sandwiches, pizzas, and full size entrees. There was some live music. Well a guy on a keyboard. But he played/sang songs that was fun to sing along with."}
{"text":"The food is ok. I've been a few times since it's just across the street from my job. I used to love the Calamari. It would have the tenticals included in theirs. But now it's just the rings and they taste frozen. I used to go a lot more when they had wings on special for lunch. But when they saw it get a lot popular, they took the special off for the lunch crowd. I thought this was super shady and stop going. I recently went back and had the Salmon Caesar Salad special. Their Caesar salads used to be pretty good but this salad was a D at best. The cheese was grated so thick it was hard to chew and the salmon was bland and tasted frozen & served on the side of the salad, not actually a part of the salad. The wings used to be really good but i havent had them recently. This place used to be awesome but it has Def gone downhill. I do like the waitresses tho. They are always so friendly and they get to know you the more you go. Seems they still get a pretty good lunch crowd. But I doubt I'll be giving it another go."}
