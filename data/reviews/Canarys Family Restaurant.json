{"text":"We were in Cleveland for the weekend. We stopped by this spot based on previous reviews. I wanted something besides the over-priced breakfast options at our hotel. This is a small business, and thankfully not a chain restaurant environment. There were the locals who appeared to be regulars and with whom the waitresses conversed. It was a good old-fashioned American restaurant experience. The breakfast was good, the service was exceptional, and the atmosphere was welcoming. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"As far as fast, easy and inexpensive eats this place takes the cake. Service is always friendly and the food is hot and decent, especially for the price. This place is a great Saturday morning breakfast joint."}
{"text":"It's a great little diner with AMAZING prices for the amount and quality of food. Great atmosphere and bright colors make it super welcoming. Went for dinner and the waitresses, though young, were super friendly and rally attentive. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Nice clean no frills restaurant with excellent service!  Very good food at great prices. They seem to have a lot of regulars which says a lot."}
{"text":"This place is a bargain for the price. The staff is quick, the food is average. Breakfast is the best meal served there."}
{"text":"went there for breakfast today.  it was very busy and we had a group of 7 .  we did not waite too long.  waitress was prompt and took our order within a very short time.  the food was great and the the price was a real surprise.  will be going back."}
{"text":"I like it because everyone crams in and you get out there FULL for $3-5.  Not going to say its the best but good for the price."}
{"text":"- this feels like the kind of family restaurant that has been serving the same food, on the same plates, on the same tables, with the same chairs.... forever.... and it should not change. - came here for breakfast while staying near the airport - and it 100% hit the spot when looking for a big, fast, easy no-frills breakfast. - country fried steak. yes.  - cash only."}
{"text":"The biscuit (for sausage gravy & biscuit) was buttery.  The combo breakfast was just enough for pancakes ...and it was all a great prices.  The waitstaff is absolutely fabulous and friendly."}
{"text":"Food is good with a nice price. Free dessert.... Friendly waitress....wish the soda would come in larger glasses...have to constantly get refills. All in all well worth the price.....was going to Somers and wow!!! Raised all price $2 or more...ridiculous.... Senior meals went up as well.....canarys is a better choice..."}
{"text":"Love Canary's. The service is always quick and pleasant. The food is great,  especially for the price. So glad it's right down the street."}
{"text":"Nice mom and pop diner. We stopped in for breakfast before getting on the road. Great service, delicious food and the prices are great too."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around.  Super fast service, very cheap prices. Take note: Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Cleveland rocks?!?! Canary's...not so much. We were just visiting Cleveland for a few days and wanted somewhere \"new\" and \"different\". When I think of diners, I think of something that has its name built from the ground up. We decided to search for something and this popped up as a choice with eh you could say decent reviews. So hubby and I jumped on it. As we pulled up to the bright yellow sign with the little yellow bird, I couldn't help but start to laugh then cracked a joke at the place being empty. Even the chef had time to go out and throw some trash away at the dumpster. Of course, us wanting to try something \"different\" still managed to get out of the car and venture inside. I politely asked the lady at the front if it was a seat yourself place, she said yes then said yes but sit on the left. So guess it changed quickly as we then turned around to go to the left. As we sat down and noticed only two guests in the dining room older than 50-60, we knew we were in for a treat. The walls and ceiling were multicolored as if it were a Mexican restaurant prior. The ceiling fans were from a 6th grade science geeks bedroom that were now collecting dust. The pie and cake display had an abundance of desserts that looked store bought. Also proudly displayed two big boxes of baking soda to keep the desserts \"fresh\". (No, we didn't get dessert) Luckily they are proactive on keeping the bugs away from the sweets with the bug trap underneath the display so we all can see. Maybe the 6th grade boy uses them for his bug collections for allowing them to rent his ceiling fans. My husband and I ordered breakfast. He ordered scrambled eggs and cheese and sausage with 3 golden brown pancakes. I ordered the pork chop breakfast with 3 over easy eggs, home fries, and toast. As the food was delivered shortly after, it didn't look terribly bad. But every thing was bland. No seasoning whatsoever. My husband could smell that his pancakes were a little on the crispy side. They tried to hide the fact that one side of the pancakes were burnt by actually placing the golden brown side up. But when you can smell the burnt you already knew to flip them over and see. He purposely cut off what he could and she most definitely saw and avoided our table. Didn't ask if we were okay or needed anything. But honestly, I would be embarrassed too. My pork chops tasted as if they were in the deep freeze for a year then flash thawed and fried with no salt or pepper. Just in straight oil. The toast was far from toast. It just seemed a little stale with Paula Deans serving of butter from 6 of her recipes on each slice. It dripped off the bread. We both didn't finish our plates. As we were getting up to leave she finally ask if we need to go boxes. I really thought she was insulting my intelligence. I guarantee she doesn't even eat there. And yes, she mentioned that it was raining cats and dogs so maybe as if we should stay until it gets done or slows down. No thanks, we are hungry for some food. This is far from a renown diner. I doubt this place will make it. But cheers if it does. I do not recommend this at all."}
{"text":"The only thing positive about this dining experience was our waitress. Attentive, smiled, and prompt. The food tasted as if it had been dropped off the back end of the Sysco truck and either microwaved or deep-fried before giving it to us."}
{"text":"Cute family restaurant. The servers were really friendly, and they did a great job helping one another out since it was so busy. Even though they were slammed, we still always had refills of everything and our dirty plates were cleared. The food came out fast and tasted good. They have lots of breakfast options, your normal diner type food. It appears that they also do lunch and dinner, although im not completely sure of their hours. I caught a glimpse of the kitchen and it seemed clean from what I could see. Restaurant area was clean. The food was extremely reasonably priced, I almost couldn't believe it. I got pancakes, toast, and hashbrowns, all a la carte, for around 6 dollars. Great deal. Good place for a quick cheap breakfast."}
{"text":"Just like North Olmsted's location. Fast, affordable, and delicious! Best breakfast around!"}
{"text":"Lauren S got it right.  This place is for regulars who have eaten here for years.  The food was like eating a banquet frozen dinner."}
{"text":"great prices .. no frills but when you see the prices you will know why .. always friendly .. food always good (for what you pay .. keep that in mind .. don't go in for a 3 dollar meal & expect anything less than a 3 dollar meal) .. breakfast deals cannot be beat .. always interesting people watching if you are into that sort of thing .. the best food in town? .. no .. but hardly the worst despite some of the negative reviews of my fellow \"Yelpers\" .. a go to for us when we are nearby & looking for a meal easy on the budget & quick to the table .. CASH ONLY is the only part you gotta remember .. ATM across the street but best to come prepared .. they make no exceptions & will NOT take a debit or credit card"}
{"text":"Been going here a year with no issues. The place does alot of business so sometimes you have to wait for a spot (even the owners family waits!!!) people all over flock to this place. I hear people talking to the staff that come from surrounding cities/suburbs. It's no surprise, they started treating my fiance and i like family and the food has always been great for the price. Don't get me started on the prices......jesus i don't think i've ever had even close to a $20 check for the two of us. We sometimes have 3 or four of us for breakfast and i don't break a twenty with tip. I go here for breakfasts, lunches and dinners. My only wish is that they would buy the closed down animal hospital and expand. LOL. If you don't like this place then you got a screw loose."}
{"text":"Ah, it's so hard to lean on Yelp when a restaurant could easily swing one way or the other: the classic no-frills breakfast joint you return to again and again, versus the holy-crap-get-me-outta-here dive diner. Unfortunately, Canarys was the latter.  Coming in here, I literally wanted to turn on m' heel and leave again. It's very dark, dingy, outdated, depressing, and 70s (and not in a groovy way). The waitresses were very sweet, but the coffee, the food, the atmosphere, were all pretty gross.   I get how a place like this can work for this clientele: the people who live in-town, work in-town, and have been coming since the dawn of time. But it's not a fit for folks like me and my family, who are looking for good food at good prices. Sorry Canarys...=("}
{"text":"Family favorite. No frills. Cash only. Good/Quick/Cheap. If you're looking for a place like Bob Evans, this ain't it. But the regulars come here for breakfast, lunch & early-bird dinner specials. Been going here since I was a kid, and it's changed very little, thankfully."}
{"text":"Went here on a layover a couple of weeks ago with 2 fellow flight attendants.  Our Captain highly recommended the place.  Pilots are notoriously cheap & hence why he liked this place so much.  If you are staying at a nearby hotel & you are hungry & you don't have much money in your wallet you will love this place!  You will find yourself dining with a lot of senior citizens.  There is nothing wrong with this I must add.  They have learned over their many years where to get the best bang for your buck.    One friend had the cheeseburger & fries.  Perfectly adequate & a bargain at $4.54 including tax.  Another friend had a breakfast special of 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, & 2 bacon for $3.25 incl. tax.  I was the hungriest of the 3 of us & went for a seafood combo that included fish, shrimps, scallops, cole slaw, baked potato & green salad all for $8 including tax!    Our server was nice enough but the bus boy/cashier was super friendly.  Warm welcome & good bye."}
{"text":"This experience was not recent, but I forgot that I never reviewed! I haven't been back to Canary's since. The waitress brought over a cup of ranch- without putting it on a plate. She carried it with her thumb in the dip. That's worth repeating- SHE HAD HER THUMB IN THE RANCH. After she set it down on the table and took her dumb thumb out of it, she licked her thumb.   Ew.  I shudder just recalling the incident.  That alone was enough to keep us from going back."}
{"text":"Nothing here is over $10 for breakfast. Just eat here already. The Mexican skillet is phenomenal. Party of 7 we got our food in under 10 mins, and our total bill was $12."}
