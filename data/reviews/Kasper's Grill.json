{"text":"I give it one star as of Dec 22nd 2014 only because this is UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP!   I have indeed eaten here before, under the PREVIOUS ownership and agree whole-heartedly with most of the previous reviews written here, but  wasn't able to add to them at the time.

I came here a second time but I MUST give 1 star as my experience here was simply... not good.  

Husband & I already went to 2 other places this day and they were not open, so last and final stop #3 before heading home....Kaspers Grill.

Mind you, already been here (for breakfast) under the old ownership, and now we were going to try lunch.  

1)  what to drink?  well, with the ELEVEN bottles of wine on display ON the wall, ON the shelf... we each decided to go with a glass of red wine.  Waitress says, only white, zinfandel, and moscato; NO red wine.  We opt for a heinekin  (these wines do not appeal to us and/or too sweet for our taste)

strike 2)  starter appetizer ON THE MENU, fried calamari.  Well, waitress came back and said they didn't have any today.

strike 3)  ok... no appetizer, we'll just order our lunch.  Husband selects a sandwich wrap with sirloin; I select the french dip sandwich -BOTH ON THE MENU.  The Chef comes out and says, \"we don't have either of the items you have ordered.  I was taking these off the menu but the waitress did not know that....\"

OK!  STRIKE THREE, YOU ARE OUT!!  

I asked, \"Has this recently changed ownership because I noticed that this place was closed for a few weeks then reopened?\"  He answered, \"yes\".

All in all...I was quite discouraged and politely stated that we decided to drink our heinekins and leave.    

I *MAY* return, when it is\"READY TO BE OPEN FOR BUSINESS\" ( I didn't say that to them, btw).  Sadly, I hesitate to return because of the poor management in just opening this business under the new management.... I therefore have no comment on the food because we didn't eat any.  (We went home for lunch)."}
{"text":"Nice little place.  I had a burger and it was well prepared and very tasty.  My wife ordered a veggie sandwich and she said it was very good.  The owner (at least I think it was the owner) was very attentive and on top of things.  He made sure we had a nice experience and went the extra mile to make sure my young daughter enjoyed her meal.  

Definitely will be coming back.  Their breakfast items sounded pretty good so I think we may try that next."}
{"text":"Went to Kaspers when it was under the previous management (did not know hands had changed until I read the reviews). We loved the breakfast and the potatoes and grits were fabulous!! Just went today at noon and was quite disappointed. Grits tasted bland and gummy. Not the same recipe. There were only 3 tables yet we waited 45 min for our eggs & bacon meals. Potatoes still good but not worth the long wait. Definitely understaffed for a Sunday brunch time. Not worth another try for lunch. I will keep checking reviews before I go back.... Sad because it's one of very few non-chain restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our time and meal there! The wait staff (our waitress) was kind and inviting and changed the TV and music selection(without us even saying anything) to a cartoon to please our children! The food was good and well prepared (I had a steak and enjoyed it although a little heavy on seasoning. I will go back and plan to for their wing night!"}
{"text":"Great new cafe in the mallard church prosperity road area.   Waffles are authentic and omelets are fluffy.  Need to support the locals!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out for the first time today and ordered the blackened chicken sandwich. The bun was really good and toasted perfectly. The chicken was well seasoned and grilled to perfection. Initially, I wished they'd given me more fries, but the sandwich was so big I was glad they didn't. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I think my 1 star is being generous.  Not only did we walk out, but others were preparing to as well.  I am certain that both the waitress and the cook were stoned.  The service was horrendous.  The food was cold, bland and terrible.  In addition, they were out of most of their breakfast foods (even bread for toast) during the breakfast hours.  The waitress was indifferent and forgot she took our order twice.  I had a few bites and could not eat anymore.  My husband had more simply because he was starving.  He was sick later that morning.  I really try to support small businesses, but I sure hope this one gets closed. The patrons were commiserating with each other.  Yes, it was that bad."}
{"text":"Not even sure it deserved a 1 star - but - I was a bit apprehensive as we walked into the restaurant at 12:00pm on a Sunday to discover there was only 1 other couple in the restaurant. (That's always a red flag for me). The restaurant itself was bright, cheerful and inviting.

I look at their Food Rating - thank goodness it was a 97 - ahh, that's good I thought.

The waitress seemed spaced out to say the least; she gave us the wrong menus, kept running back and forth to get confirmation to our questions from the cook, I guess, slow, finally when all was said and done, she said she was new. (Well that there was no hamburger meat. (who doesn't have hamburger meat available when you have burgers on the menu?) Then my husband ordered a pork chop off the dinner menu. Well wouldn't you know, a few minutes later the waitress was back to tell him that there were no dinners on the lunch menu. Well, he wound up scrapping the barrel and ended up getting eggs and steak (they sell breakfast items all day long.)

I order a Reuben sandwich (Reuben s can be a hard sandwich to make). There was way too much corned beef on the sandwich, and barely any sauerkraut or 1000 Dressing on it. The bread on the top was nice and crispy, the bottom was soggy. I did ask the waitress for more sauerkraut, which she finally brought out after she forgot it a couple of times. 

We had a restaurant.com coupon, which we were actually going to give to the people sitting next to us, as we did not plan to come back to visit this restaurant after all the snaffews. The waitress said she didn't have a clue how to work the cash register to credit back the other couple their money so they could use the coupon, so, they couldn't use it.

It was a horrible experience and we will not be going there again."}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time and loved it.  The special was a pork chop stuffed with peppers, sausage, and dressing and I decided to give it a try. It was amazing!  The food excelled in both presentation and taste. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"At dinnertime, we had great service; pleasant and effective member of the wait staff.  Surprised that there were a few true craft beers (in bottles, no taps).  Ate a dinner for two, each with a beer and spent $30.   I'd say that the food was just \"ok\".  The place is small and has minimal \"atmosphere\".  For instance, we didn't feel like lingering with another beer.  Which is all to say that based on the so-so food and the minimalist atmosphere, the prices seemed a bit on the high side.  I'm thinking they're trying to be just a bit more than they are.  Maybe a decent lunch place, though."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few weeks ago for breakfast and I was happy to see they had a crowd because when they initially opened as Kasper's Cafe' it never seemed crowded.  I ordered the pancakes with eggs and bacon and it was really good.  The only negative was the wait time because they were so busy.  I would definitely go back.  Also, the price was great for the amount of food.  The pancakes, eggs, and bacon were about $5 -- definitely cheaper and closer than Cracker Barrel and IHOP."}
{"text":"I was surprised about some of the bad reviews, but everyone is titled to their own opinion. I went to Kasper's Grill because I wanted to try something new. There are way too many franchise spots in the surrounding area. I work near here so I like to be able to grab a quick bite and get back to work. 

After my girlfriend and I got a table, we were helped by a friendly waitress who was happy to help with whatever we needed. The food arrived promptly and it was very well made. She ordered a burger and I ordered the Cajun Pasta. The burger was juicy, and my Cajun Pasta was full of flavor. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering from there and it will be my last. The chicken wings were dry, no flavor and the cheese sticks were cold. When I called to complain, the guy I spoke to only made up excuses. I paid 20 bucks for food I ultimately threw in the trash."}
{"text":"We stopped by this little gem a couple of days ago for lunch. Everything about this restaurant was perfect. The dining room was small and quiet, the staff were attentive, helpful, and plesant, the food was fresh, hot, and expertly prepared. The bacon cheeseburger I had was one of the best I've had in Charlotte, and my boyfriend loved his Reuben. We will be returning often."}
{"text":"First time here today, on a lunch date with the wife. She got the Baked Bacon & Turkey, and I got the French Dip.
PROS:
- Both sandwiches were tasty. Not \"out of this world,\" but a good lunch. The fries were good as well.
- The front staff are very friendly and welcoming.
CONS:
- The ambiance is just so-so. It lacked a certain homey warmth we like to see in a local cafe.
- The chef (who I think is the owner as well) does not come across as super friendly. We caught eyes a couple times while he was in the kitchen (it's a small place), but not once did he crack a smile. Perhaps he was just \"in the zone\" on his work.
- We were in the mood for a couple IPAs, so we ordered the only ones on the beer menu, which was very slim pickings in the first place. Unfortunately, when they arrived (bottles already opened), they were \"pale ales\" and not true IPAs (any self-respecting IPA drinker knows a pale ale tastes VERY different than an IPA). We brought this to the manager's (at least we think she was the manager) attention, and while she DID apologize and state that they would be correcting the menu for the future, she did NOT offer to comp our beers. Granted, we drank them (they were already open, so to pour them out would be true \"alcohol abuse\"!), but I would expect at least a 50% discount given the inaccuracy of their menu. As it was, we paid $8 for a couple pale ales we could've purchased across the street for a couple bucks.

In the end, while we enjoyed a nice lunch together, my wife and I probably will not be frequenting this local cafe even though it is only a mile from our house. We hope the business does well though. It's been sad to see so many businesses come and go in that location, so it'd be nice to see one stick around longer and thrive."}
{"text":"Tried the grill for the first time today.  We were looking for a brunch since it was Sunday.   After checking yelp,  we decided to give it a try.  We were very surprised it was not busier than it was although the rainy weather may have been the issue.  The food was plated very elegantly and just the right amount.  The eggs were perfect. . Not greasy and the potatoes were cooked perfect with great flavor.   After checking the lunch and dinner menus we will definitely be back.  They have wine specials and an intriguing menu.  Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say.  Had lunch with a friend, I ordered the fire cracker shrimp my friend had a the fried tilapia sandwich (blackend or grilled options as well),  Both were very good, service was great, atmosphere was quaint.  Very clean bathroom (at least the women's).  Will return."}
{"text":"I've been to Kaspers Grill a few times for a burger to go, but today I sat in.  The cocktail I had was amazing, the portions were more than filling and the service was prompt.  I highly recommend this as a quick lunch spot or even a place to have an affordable dinner with an amazing drink to compliment after work."}
{"text":"Probably the worst food and worst management and worst app that I have seen in a long time. This restaurant has gone out of business a few times and reopened a few times. Each time getting worse and worse"}
{"text":"We had a yummy brunch!  I really want this business to succeed, so I want to add some glows and grows. 
Glows: The corned beef hash and strawberry french toast had the perfect flavors. Truly amazing and delicious. Everyone was so nice and friendly-great service! The waitress was so attentive and my coffee was never empty. The owner came out to the dining room between orders to check on his guests and make sure everyone was enjoying their meals. 
Grows: the atmosphere is a little odd. I expected a diner with the menu options, but the inside looks exactly what it is, a restaurant space that's been in many different hands and has no theming. A coat of white paint to cover the mustard sponge paint would go a long way to brighten the dining area. 
The servings were HUGE!  And your plate is pretty much made up of the one thing you order, no sides included. I'd love to see the serving sizes reduced, kept at the same price, and then have a side added - fresh fruit would have been great. 

All in all, I'll probably be back, but will probably end up splitting a dish due to the size of each plate. Thanks for the delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"I'm trying to make it a habit to try more local vs chain, at least once a week. I'm becoming more pleasantly surprised  each time.  This restaurant looks like a hole in the wall,  quite small in the office space, but decor and food make up for exterior. 

Traditional American cuisine, burgers, fries, fish, kabobs, grilled cheese, etc. Menu was limited due to kitchen remodeling,  but great food nonetheless. We got burgers and chicken kabobs.  Mushroom Burger was HUGE, sweet potato fries were seasoned just right.  Not the best burger I've had but better than most.  We would definitely go again but try to switch up options."}
{"text":"I went out for a late lunch with my girlfriend on a Sunday afternoon.

Exterior Impression:
The side with the sign on the front is very classy, the side with it appears to be chalk board paint, looks trashy and needs to be maintained, desperately. 

Interior Impression:
Very very cute, everything was decorated on the inside for the fall season

Service Impression:
My waiter did not seem knowledgeable about the menu, however we dismissed it as him being new. Later we learned he appeared to be the owner's son?

Food Impression:
I wash happy with my nacho plate, real cheese was used, we were both happy. We also ordered a side of mash potatoes. Or should I say, Garlic.
I love garlic, I put it in practically everything, however, there is a strong limit on how much garlic you should use. 

Overall: 
I would give this place one more chance, but I am not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly and my husbands meal was great. That's the end of the good news. I ordered a glass of house Cabernet, server came back several minutes later to say they were out of the house wine and the next available choice was $10.99 per glass. Ok, fine. I really wanted wine so I went with it. Oh, I should mention that it's Valentine's Day and a Saturday night at 6pm...and there was only ONE server in the joint. Granted, it's a small restaurant but she quickly became overwhelmed and the service took a hit. She walked us through the menu because there were 5-6 items they were out of. Considering the small menu size, being out of that much product is odd. Especially on Valentine's Day.  We order, lots of time passes, then our food emerges from the kitchen and our friendly server heads our way. The folks next to us asked the server what she was carrying and she actually stopped at their table and put our plates in front of them while giving them a description of what it was. That's just weird. When she was done showcasing our dinners she brought it over to us. Again, husband's ragin' Cajun pasta dish was great. I got chicken parm and it was pretty bad however the presentation on both was good. While we were eating, a young guy came in to speak with the server about a paycheck dispute. They had a lengthy, heated conversation right there in front of all the customers. It appeared that our server is also the GM or possible part owner. Anyway, it got awkward fast. We're trying to have a nice dinner, not witness employee drama. Overall, it was a bad experience and it's important to point out that one can be friendly and incompetent at the same time."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Great food! I ordered the pecan belgian waffle and its probably the best I've had...will definitely visit again.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is a tough review went to Kasper's for lunch with my wife, because it was highly recommended especially for their burgers, We were disappointed with the service, and found out they were under new management. The food was not bad we would probably try it again once management fixes some of their problems."}
