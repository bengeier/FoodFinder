{"text":"Spent the day during St. Patrick's day downtown, going inside the Arcade we decided on pizza however there was a problem as soon as things began. Taking my order, the man behind the register was fumbling with numbers and orders until the total looked a bit over priced; I had ordered 2 slices of Chicken Pizza and A Stromboli with a Medium drink for my companion, however when I got the recipt I noticed 3 additional charges. 

At first I was alright with them charging me for an extra slice however, the discrepancy began when I asked them if they could just give me my money back. The fellow who waited on me, made a big deal about it and asked if I would just take a third slice, at first I Was alright with it however, he then proceeded to take my receipt off me and did not return it

The following issue is when I sat down and decided to ask for a copy, the man asked if he could write me a reciept to which I agreed to...he just etched a number down and handed it over to me! Not the charges or any OTHER additional information, this is when things began to get quite frustrating and aggravating, with the man even getting an attitude with me!

I decided I had had enough, I took my three slices back and asked for a refund seeing as how they were playing some sort of game with me. They began to complain and even spoke up \"What am I supposed to do with these slices?\" 
I Just wanted my money back, the guy threw his arms up and stomped away, the entire experience itself with POOR and I would NOT recommend anyone attempt to buy from them and IF You do, keep a good eye on your transactions. Someone there is pocketing the money they're cheating out of people there."}
{"text":"I'm going to say that this is a Sbarro....you've been to Sbarro right?  Regardless you will be getting pizza that's not quite as good as a reputable local joint but it's better than Pizza Hut or Dominoes with large foldable slices of pizza.

I would usually give a big chain 3 stars as a base to judge other establiahments , however this particular Sbarro handles the lunch crowd quick and efficentelly and limits waiting.  This is HUGE because lunch time is valuable time and often limited.  I've not had to wait more than just a few minutes to get a fresh slice and a soda.  

There are better Pizza places downtown, but for speed and a decent slice this is a place to go."}
{"text":"Breakfast pizza- check
Good pizza- check
Heavy accents by the employees- check

What more could you ask for? Sbarro's in the 5th Avenue Place food court overall is just what you need and that's quick pizza. The main problem is their food can be greasy whether it's pizza or their potatoes, I hate when food tastes like grease or you use have a roll of paper towels just to dry it off. I think pizza is all about what style you are into so I think everyone who reviews any pizzeria is biased to some degree. I think the price is kind of high but the slices are always big so it's a give an take."}
