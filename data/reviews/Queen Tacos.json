{"text":"Amazing! Friendly service and great food. I usually order the mulitas. They also have LA style street corn. Happy to find a place like this in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've tried a few trucks around town and THIS truck is by far a gem!! Randomly came across it while doing a bank run, and I'm so happy I did. I make about 2 visits a week, because why not? Foods amazing and always fresh, the owner is super friendly they always know my order by the time I make it to the window, and the service is quick. From a self-proclaimed taco enthusiast, I HIGHLY recommend their carne asada !"}
