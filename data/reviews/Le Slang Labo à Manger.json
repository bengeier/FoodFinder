{"text":"Sea bass was delicious - cooked perfectly over the grill , well seasoned and accompanied by tasty & eye-pleasing medley of  veggies. Cocktails were great. Service is pleasant and professional.   Too bad loud music makes it  hard  to relax & enjoy table conversation."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great food and great service! I'm definitely going back! The grilled octopus was melt in your mouth.  So tender and tasty, I'm still dreaming about it.  The tuna tartar was incredibly fresh and don't get me started on the burrata... Wow! Sooo good! We truly enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"This place is now closed. No surprise. 

Went here for dinner w my husband. Good points: decent cocktails, nice relaxed casual decor & good appetizers. I had the beet salad & my husband had firecracker shrimp. Bad points: The mains were meh. My husband had the ribs which were ok - not bad but nothing to remember. I had the steak. My steak was undercooked and not warm - yuck. Also for what the place is, it's appetizers are too pricey. 

The service was great (which is why I gave 3 vs 2 stars). I was asked why I didn't eat my steak & after I said why they removed it from our bill & asked if I'd like anything else (I didn't. Cold steak put me off). 



Won't be rushing back here since Montreal has way too many good restaurant options.

Dinner for 2 w cocktail & a bottle of wine =$150-$175"}
{"text":"Wonderful new place in NDG- really a step above the rest, and Slang will attract people who live downtown. The ambiance is modern and chic. The bar is vert well equipped and serves up wonderful infused drinks- here's another plus- Slang serves filtered and carbonated water, with a conscience- it's on tap. 

We loved the octopus and the dumplings as starters, excellent choices. The catch of the day was also perfectly balanced. Slang also serves it's own own fresh baked roll with churned butter- nice touch.

The staff here is very attentive, without being pushy or sticky. We also greatly enjoyed looking into the kitchen at the young, creative and professional staff. This team is tight- and they know what they're doing. The restaurant was full, but there was no panic or sense of disorganization. Management is experienced.

The price- 2 starters (very good sized portions) a salad and a main, with two cocktails and a bottle of wine, under 200$- 

This team has struck the perfect balance for this neighbourhood- we're thankful.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Slang.  First was shortly after they opened and second was this evening.  They have been open now two or three months.  On our first visit the food was nice and there were understandable glitches that come from a new opening.   The owners, a couple, were obviously excited and mingled with their friends.   

 Tonite, our second visit, the food was nice and the service was attentive. The young staff our attentive.  However we won't be returning.  The owners continued to mingle only with their friends. Whether at the bar or seated. Made no effort to ask any other patrons how their evening was.   It felt very cliquy. very uncomfortable.  For two hundred dollars it would have been nice if they at least  pretended they were happy we were there.  

This is a first. Very unusual and very uncomfortable.  It's too bad."}
{"text":"Location: On Monkland, corner of Oxford. Street parking available and it's not a pain in the arse to find. The closest subway is Villa Maria - cross the street and walk straight on down. 

The place: I like the space - minimal decor, lots of dark floors and walls, dimly lit, very casual vibe. They have a decent-sized terrace as well. 

The food: I split an appetizer with my date and we decided to go for the firecracker shrimp. The shrimp were quite big, and from a flavor perspective, they were pretty darn good with just a tiny hint of heat. My main was the Saigon salad - black soba noodles (served cold), shaved beets, cabbage, Taro and mango with a sesame vinaigrette. Frankly, I wanted to love this dish but I just liked it. My plate was basically layers of shaved vegetables on top of noodles that were hidden at the very bottom of the plate, and a vinaigrette served on the side. Personally, I think the dish would be better if it was served mixed - as in, mix that sh*t up instead of making me work for it. I also felt like it was lacking something and that something was meat. Chicken or shrimp would have completed the salad for me. Lastly, I think chunks of beets (or other veggies) would have been nicer than shaved veggies. In any case, the salad was good, just not the best cold noodle dish I've had. My date had the salmon and enjoyed it.  We didn't have dessert because, frankly, their desserts were incredibly boring.

Service: Very friendly. The hostess was super smiley and helpful, and our waiter was as well.

Price point: For what it is, I think it's a little pricey. As another reviewer mentioned, their starters are very expensive. For half an appetizer, my main and wine, it cost me $40."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner, table of 10. The music was amazing, the service was very good and the staff was very friendly ! Went on a Saturday night, the restaurant was full and vibrant ! Loved it ( parking was a little difficult )"}
{"text":"Went with a group 9, on a Saturday night, and was extremely surprised (in a great way) with the speed of service, amazing flavors, and overall experience! 

The guys (3) split 3 apps and 3 mains. General Tao Calamari, extremely tasty, Burratta Salad, delicious and Grilled Octopus, better than average! For the mains, Lamb Chops, unreal, Ribs, spectacular and Lamb Filled Pasta, exceptional. 

Again, great evening, great vibe for this NEW local spot! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this resto for a while and finally went last weekend and I was greatly disappointed. It first started that we reserved for 3 people and when we got there to find out that the reservations were wrongly taken and the maitre D did not make us feel welcomed we stood in the entrance awaiting while he tried to shuffle their mistake on valentine weekend not really wanting to put 2 tables together for a party of 3 although there was 3 sets throughout d resto that could have been put together to then finally doing it.  I ordered appetizers to learn that they were out of grilled asparagus that they offered on the menu and the 9$ supposedly giant tiger shrimp was barely the size of that of a medium regular shrimp almost the size of my thumb.  Then I ordered a $20 burger which they brought to me raw (they never asked what cooking I wished for)and the same for another person in the party. We both sent back the burgers and they brought back 1/2 d burger as they permitted themselves to cut off the burger from where we had verified to see if it was more cooked so at the end of the day we paid $20 for half a burger. Never did anyone apologize.  The service was awful and not very pleasant they were simply pleasant when we decided not to have coffee nor dessert there as we couldn't take it.  Once the bill was given to us then the server was pleasant and then at that point the rude MaitreD thank us for understanding him when we came in not sure what he thank us for he was extremely rude and tick us off we should have cut our loss then and walk out! I never write up reviews but this was so bad that I definitely wanted to take the time to advise so no one can have a ruined planned evening."}
{"text":"The look, menu / bar menu, service and food were actually quite good but at the end of the night I used the restroom and it was so astonishingly disgusting that I was repulsed by the place. I don't even know if I can adequately describe how putrid the washrooms were - the soap dispenser was broken, there was human waste all over the back and all around the toilet seat, there were chunks of vomit down the wall, dusty cobb webs hung from the ceiling - just absolutely disgusting. I couldn't help but wonder if that was representative of what passes for clean in the kitchen as well. What a shame about this place!"}
{"text":"Bel ajout pour NDG sur Monkland, joli resto tendance/design, délicieux cocktails de qualité, menu varié, terrasse extérieure, très bon service des serveurs par contre prix un peu cher, ça monte vite. 3 cocktails, 2 tacos, 1 plat de gnocchis, 1 Slang Burger, le tout avec taxes + service, 122$ donc quand même bon, mais pour ocassions spéciales, je dirais."}
{"text":"Nice place on Monkland for a casual night out. Chill vibe, good drinks and DJ playing decent tracks. Food was pretty good. Try the fried calamari. I know I know... Been there, don't that. But try it. Comes close to one of my fave fried calamari dishes. Has a great sweet and sour sauce with sesame seeds. The agnolotti was pretty good; pasta was perfectly al dente. All portions are pretty decent. Service left a bit to be desired though."}
{"text":"This is first in Montreal where 7 different restaurants come in together to pull off this amazing Sunday brunch.  Many foodies, bloggers, chefs and friends were invited to this gluttonous event. It happens every first Sunday of the Month and you have to reserve in advance!

Four courses were on the set menu with two dishes per course for the first three. We were welcomed with a bourbon maple shooter and then sipped on our Bellini while waiting for our food. The dj was amazing and it was so much fun seeing all the Montreal food lovers reunited for this amazing party."}
{"text":"The service is exceptional! They found a way to accommodate a baby seat that I wanted to keep elevated on a chair next to me. They left a bottle of water on our table and kept refilling the glasses. And they kept checking on us throughout the meal to make sure everything was ok. 
The food was also really good. I shared a Saigon salad with my hubby. And ordered the red snapper as a main. My hubby got the tuna tartar and quinoa salad. All were delicious. It was just annoying to peal the skin off the red snapper. 
The place has a certain class to it. 
The down side is that the portions are small and I was still hungry after the meal. Also it was expensive. 
It's still a cute place. I would come back for a glass of wine on the terrace."}
