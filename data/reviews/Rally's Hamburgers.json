{"text":"Um, this place is amazing. We laughed ourselves silly reading the negative reviews in the voice of an angry 8 year old stomping their feet while we waited for less than 5 min. It's fast food people and it is deeelicious. Nice staff too.   As one who specializes in late night drive through's, I understand the complexity of the interaction. Shake machine's are frequently down (which can certainly be maddening) and wait times can seem like an eternity to the third shift worker and those who have long since parted from sobriety. But let me tell you, it is worth the wait and better than others I've frequented. 5 stars"}
{"text":"They make your food fast which is nice, but barely give you anything to drink. They fill your cup up with mostly ice."}
{"text":"The burgers were good. Nothing spectacular. The chili cheese fries were good but nothing spectacular. The banana milkshake was on fleek doe"}
{"text":"It looks a little dirty when you walk up or go through the drive thru.  Staff  was professional, fast and courteous enough.  Food was okay (not great but not god awful).  I've only been to this location once and most likely will never go again.  ANYONE WHO GIVES THIS LOCATION 5 STARS IS CLEARLY A DRUG ADDICT OR AN EMPLOYEE FROM THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"This was the second time we went there. Had a less than impressive visit the first time but we figured with it being opening weekend we would give them a break.  This time the service was just as bad. Upon placing the order for some combos we were told they didn't have drinks. How can a fast food place not have drinks? Then we waited in line for almost 10 minutes waiting to get served by a rude girl who seemed more interested in what was going on inside rather than dealing with customers.  The food is mediocre and the large fries are a joke. Don't waste your extra money.   It is a shame this place is ran so badly. We were hoping it would be like other Rallys we have been to. Looks like we won't be going back now."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I placed my order for 2 All-American Cheeseburgers ahead of the family of five who placed a large order. After a 10-12 minute wait, the family of five got their order first while I had to wait an additional 5 minutes.  The excuse given by the employee was they were busy and short-staffed!! I don't see how that makes a difference in whose order is prepared first. Will never return to this Rally's location...not even worth one Star."}
{"text":"VERY SLOW!!! Waited in line for 30 minutes with no way to get out. Food was great, service not do much"}
{"text":"Went back today and they actually fix it so I change my review nail Was delicious the first time I went I couldn't stop thinking about going back the second time I went they had a truck blocking the drive thru with their groceries being delivered for the store my food was not good call them to tell them but they never answer the phone the phone just beeped but that is the number for them I hope they improve I'm glad to see their back the staff was very friendly but the food needed to be improved needed to come out hot I will give them another try and a couple weeks hopefully it will be better cuz the first time was delicious"}
{"text":"Not worth it at all. Way overpriced for what you get. No different than BK. Damn it! All I wanted was a half way decent burger."}
{"text":"Food is usually hot and fresh. Always open Drive thru burgers, fish, chicken, hot dogs, wings, dessert. DELICIOS FRENCH FRIES  CONS: Menu is really small and far from the speaker so it is better to walk up."}
{"text":"Listen to the reviews! Worst service I've ever had and the food was just as bad. I've never left a burger unfinished until I ate here. The fries were stale, the bacon on the burger had the consistency of rubber and the bun was soggy with grease.  Go to the Carl's Jr across the street and grab an All Natural Burger for your fast food fix."}
{"text":"WORST fast food service EVER.  I went to grab something FAST (key word) to go and I waited in the drive thru line JUST to order for 10mins and then when I got there was told \"just a min\" and 5mins later she finally took my order (mind you there were NO cars at the window).  When I pulled up to the window I got my drink and then was told to go park and they would bring my order out.  Looked like I was not the only one, there were the others siting waiting in their cars.  I did ask before I left the window how long it would be and she told me 3mins....10mins later here comes my food.  There is a wall that runs in front of the parking spots to the bldg so when the food came out they bring it to the wall for me to get OUT which I can't because I have a broken foot and on crutches.  THERE WAS A REASON I WAS ORDERING FROM THE DRIVE THRU."}
{"text":"Sean is right about the location (so funny) but the fries are really good, I also drank a banana shake (lots of sugar) its ok if your looking for tasty fries."}
{"text":"Staff seems like they are cluless, and the food def is NOT worth the wait. 3 cars in front of me & took nearly 20 mins to finally get my food. Do yourself a favor & keep driving.."}
{"text":"Way over priced. Should've went to McDonald's across the street. Ordered a coke it was watered down so I asked to change for a sprite and still water downed . The chicken sandwich wasn't as big as I thought it would be. Only good thing is their fries."}
{"text":"I do not know why this place has such low stars- I am not a fan of fast food I am a classy man but I was in the area and I took the kids here for some burgers and fries. I am not too big of a fan of this food but by far the \"Baconzilla\" burger is absolutely delicious and the best I have ever eaten- the fries are also seasoned really well and good! The only problem is you are forced to sit outside and it is sort of a bad neighborhood. Now my kids are always asking Bab can we go to Rallys instead of Carls Jr or Burger King they used to ask for. Good place all around I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I was super excited to see a Rally's open up in Phoenix. It's still a drive for me, but not as far as the Tempe location.   My husband and I both had a bacon cheddar crisp burger (or something like that), an apple pie, and we shared an order of fully loaded fries. First off, the fries were AMAZING. They brought me good memories of Checker's back home in Orlando. They have ranch, cheese sauce and bacon. Mmmmm. The burger was just OK. It was a decent size, but it had a weird sauce that neither of us liked very much. My husband said he felt like he was eating a hot dog because of the taste of the sauce. I was thinking the same thing before he even said it. It's like a sweet sort of sauce that clashes with the rest of the burger IMO. The apple pies were pretty good, too.   As far as the wait time, we went around 11:30 a.m. on a Monday morning and were greeted immediately. We had our food in about two minutes. We walked up to the window instead of going through the drive through though.   The location is really, really rough. A lot of shady looking characters walking around. If it looks like that late morning on a weekday I can't imagine what it looks like on a weekend night. I'll have to forego any Rally's cravings if they hit during that time. All in all it was a good experience. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am much more impressed with this new Rally's (opened 2013) than the other locations that I'm willing to make the farther drive.  The service is very fast, and the food tastes very good.  Love the promotions and pricing.  2 for $3, 2 for $4, 2 for $5.  Delicious.  Personal favorites are Two Cheesy and the American Double Melt.  Burgers aren't as ambitiously delicious as Swensons or Five Guys, but the value and reasonably great taste definitely makes this a great place to go without breaking the bank.  You get much better beef than McDonalds and Burger King and better prices."}
{"text":"The place should be called drive thru and pull around to the parking lot and wait for your order. Been here a couple of times and that's been the common theme. Last time they forgot about me as I waited almost 20 minutes when they weren't even busy. I had to walk back up to the window before they even began prepping my food. 3 minutes so far on this wait (or enough time to write this review... And I don't type fast). I joked with the girl at the window before pulling to the lot about waiting. Losing my sense of humor. 6 minutes gone. Drive thru is dead and nobody at the walk up window. Really 10 minutes???  Time to go walk up and claim my food."}
{"text":"Love the the chicken bites, service is slow and borderline, but 9/!10 the food rocks!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Fast service.  Fabulous burgers and the fries were spot on.  Will definitely be back!!!!   Just wish they would open one in the far west valley!!!!"}
{"text":"GROSS.DIRTY.CHAOS.FILTHY. Those are just a few words I can think of to describe this location. Took almost 30 minutes in the drive-thru waiting for our order. Had to give the simple order 3 times and they still got it wrong. So sick after we ate. The fries tasted like the oil was very old. Will never never never return."}
{"text":"Good things come to those who wait... so i hear... thankfully I came at 12:30am when no one was here.... but wait, we still had to wait 15 mins for our food... when no other customers were here... but it was super amazing... in conclusion, good things come to those who wait...."}
{"text":"So much better than Tempe. Fast and accurate service and delicious food. Central Phoenix does it right! You guys are great. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Horrible place to eat. Just went there tonight and it was not great.  The menu board's light didn't work on the one I was at.  The shake machine is broken. The customer service was horrible and I didn't even get the right change back.  Then when I get home the food wasn't even the correct food.  The lady took my order and kept asking me if the order was correct and which sandwich had cheese and which didn't and they still got it fucking wrong.  How pathetic!!! Will never eat hear again and it's a shame because the looked good."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time fast service and decent customer service. Had to wait 10 minutes for my food. Order the 4 for 3 and when I got my burger it was almost all bun. I opened it up and was shocked to how bad the quality of the burger was. I won't be back. I'm extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Waited at the drive through speaker for 10 minutes with no response and then just reversed and left."}
{"text":"its been forever since ive been to rallys.. so glad i came back!  pros: plenty of seating food served was fresh french fries were yummy!! gotta luv baconator! lol staff was friendly place was clean cons: high prices no trays given for dine in use, everything bagged like it was to go only .. weird apparently they have no plastic knives to cut ur burgers.. but did offer to cut it for us. will i come back? i sure will :) i stayed full all evening on the meal i had there!!"}
{"text":"It's not common for me to dole out one star, since most places have something that redeems itself.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case for this location.  This was my third visit and the second one for my husband since we moved out to Mesa, and each time was abysmal for several reasons.  First, the food quality is terrible.  The first time, their fries were so cold that they were hard and inedible, and the burger wasn't made properly.  They left off a condiment.  I thought perhaps it was a fluke, since Rally's foods is usually good, but the second and third time was more of the same.  Second, they are the slowest fast-food joint I've been too in a long time.  They ask you to hold while you're at the speaker -- even though no one's in drive-thru.  They take forever to come to the window when you finally pull up after having ordered.  And they take forever to bring your food.    Third, their service is shoddy.  The guys here just don't care.  Every time I felt like I was talking to robots.  Considering minimum wage in Arizona is damn near $11 per hour, they can't claim that it's because they're underpaid.  These guys just don't care.  Period.  Foiurth, their parking lot and surrounding area are just dirty and unkempt, with visible litter and debris.  Checker's, what they're called in the South, was my go-to place because of their stone-groove-winner fries and fresh food.  The Mesa location has ensured that Chick-Fil-A will be my soul fast-food discretion."}
{"text":"Have been sitting in line for 20 minutes now and am going to be late for work as I am trapped and can't back out! Don't they have enough staff? It is dinner time already! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Went there pretty late around 12am. Pulled up to the drive through window and said it would be 3 separate orders. They told me I could only do one order per car. So I order all my food and then ask if I can also get a cup of water. They told me they would have to charge me $2.50 for the cup. Are you kidding me? For a cup of water that's supposed to be free?? I told them no thanks and they ask if this is all under one order. I ask them \"didn't you just tell me only one order for car? So yea\" while I hear people laughing in the background. So unprofessional. Wouldn't be surprised if they spit in our food even though they were the ones being rude. Never going back."}
{"text":"The drive-thru takes way to long it's ridiculous almost 30 min I can't believe this can't even leave because I'm stuck behind cars...need to work on this"}
{"text":"Mcdonalds didn't have their shake machine up during their lunch rush, so I went across the street and had absolutely no problem getting 3 here! Friendly staff, the shakes were properly mixed and not sloppy. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"When we arrived there at 10:20 pm we were told that their system was down and they couldn't take any orders. Outside of the questionable excuse, we saw them give someone food when we pulled up to take our order. Most of the employees were sitting around doing nothing. Apparently they didn't want to do their job, which is fine because we won't be back at this location again."}
{"text":"I haven't had a Big Buford in years. Pittsburgh use to have three Rally's locations, but they have all been closed for almost ten years. I love Rally's so much I have driven to Cleveland just to get it!   The last time I was there they had a Philly Cheesesteak Cheeseburger. Yeah you hear that right! A Philly Cheesesteak Cheeseburger! It was f'ing amazing! A cheeseburger on Texas toast topped with Philly Cheesesteak! Whoever thought of this burger is an utter genius!   The next time we went we got American Double Melts. They're delicious as well! They even offer wings now. You can choose from Medium Buffalo, Honey BBQ, Asian Kick, Angry Buffalo and Garlic Parmesan.   Don't even get me started on those delicious loaded fries covered in cheese, ranch dressing and bacon!   They also have chili dogs, fish sandwiches, and chicken sandwiches. Their milkshakes are great too!   Time for another trip to Cleveland!   http://www.checkers.com"}
{"text":"Keep up the good work. Went there today. Fast and friendly service. As well as fresh food."}
{"text":"Not as good as I remembered from the midwest, but still decent. There was a quite a bit of wait at the drive through window for them to pass the oder out. It was a simple order, just a Buford and a drink, probably took about 10 mins. However, I do realize this is a new location and it looked like there was a guy training employees at the same time.  Not a show stopper, I will be back when future cravings call."}
{"text":"I would have been better off going to McDonald's across the street.. Waiting in line for over 15 min, just to get a cold hamburger and fries.. WILL NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"The outside tables have never been wiped down.in two years never seen the tables clean.bird droppings all over tables.bird droppings dropping from overhead rafters.if not a health hazard I wonder why."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot I live right down the street and I love their fries. I got in drive thru at 3:09 2 people in front of me, 2 behind. I ordered 2 meals and they asked me to park and wait because it will take awhile to make my food, which is perfectly fine. 27 mins later he brings out my food. The fries were old over cooked and cold, I ordered a large fry and it was less than half full. My small fry was full but also old & over cooked and cold. Both burgers were also wrong. I'm not sure what is going on there but I'm not going back at night   The owner was wearing an $80 affliction shirt why can't he spend that money to replace the parking lot."}
{"text":"Pulled in to this restaurant en route to San Diego...I have lived in Chicago all my life and the Rallys on the Southside moved twice as fast as this place! I mean 20 min in the walk up for two entrees?? I got full on my pop before my food came. Cheese wasn't melted on my burger..smh..Come on yall...we gotta do better"}
{"text":"This location is just as good as the Tempe one. I use to go out of my way before I moved tp Tempe to eat here.  It's that good!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by for dinner and am extremely annoyed. There were probably 4-5 people working and not many customers at all. I got greeted and when I started ordering the man didn't say anything and then asked me to repeat the meal again, so I did and both times I said no ranch on the burger medium with their smoothie. Then I ordered my second meal with only ketchup mayo cheese and lettuce on my burger, medium with a Dr Pepper. When I got to the window the 4 or 5 people working were talking about casual things, chatting about how long each of them worked there and not really paying attention to the customers. I also think one of them was the manager. When I got my order and drove all the way home I saw I got one burger with ranch. One burger with onions pickles mayo mustard ketchup and cheese. A small fry and a medium fry. A smoothie. And a coke. I work in fast food. I get that there can sometimes be mistakes, I get that you want to chat with your co workers. I absolutely hate when customers don't really understand that we are human behind the counter and sometimes get something wrong.. But 4 things??? If it was just the ranch or the onions and mustard, no biggie. Just the coke, fine, it's just a drink. The wrong size fry, I would like to get what I paid for, but it's the difference of a few cents. Whatever. But all four mistakes in one small order? While the crew is talking, and not paying attention? Maybe there are some things that can easily be worked on."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service...they were running a special ..Bogo Big Buford Sandwich. I asked for 2 so I could get special...I noticed that only one was put in bag...when I returned and spoke to staff/manager he insisted I only asked for one... I said \"you've gotta be kidding me?\" \"Really?\" \"You think I would return from being a mile down the road because I wasn't 100% sure I asked for 2?\" Manager insisted I only asked for one and told me I would have to pay for another to get Bogo deal...Bogus mind games...unprofessional!!! Never again.. also wrote they're corporate office...super lame..."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Crap fries soggy and small!! Hard hamburger bun! Burger taste like crap! Literally! Rally's in Tempe is good this place is brand new and takes no pride in there food or service...I am so disappointed!"}
{"text":"Honestly its in a bad part of town, but the food is as good as it gets. I could eat here every day if i didnt get so damn fat. The fries melt in your mouth and the burgers are priced nice and the meals are portioned right. I dont understand the negative comments really and i eat here a few times a month."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time (and believe me, you'll sit in the drive-thru long enough to watch an entire episode of \"Pawn Stars\" on your phone while you wait) or your $$. Food is HORRIBLE, ate half my burger and threw it away. Their \"famous\" fries? tasteless. Threw them out too. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First off, one of the drive through machines didn't work. We sat there for 5 minutes until we realized it. Not a big deal. I ordered a Baconzilla, two chili dogs, chicken bites, loaded fries, a sprite and a Hi-C. They forget my two drinks and the side of ranch that came with the bites. Wasn't too inpressed with my first visit here. Food was good though, hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Took a minute at 330am, which is weird considering the time of the morning. Out of lettuce and tomato as well which could be because of delivery day."}
{"text":"Piece of shit place, been on drive thru for almost 30 minutes then they tell me to go park cause theyre barely going to fry my wings like really? Ive seen people parked before i got here and still waiting All reviews talk about slow service so why not hire more employees for fast service?"}
{"text":"New Rally's location and some much needed variety for the area. A few points, this location is very busy, it's been open for a couple weeks now and the customers are non stop.   The Baconzilla and fries were very good, the wait was a bit long. It's a new location though and the employees are still a bit green.   I hope Rally's sees the success they are having at this location and improve the facilities some more."}
{"text":"I could have sworn I had Rally's before in my lifetime, but after I tried those fries, there is no way that I had it before because I definitely would have remembered it! The fries are THE BEST! The burger wasn't anything special, definitely can settle for burger king since it isn't much of a difference. They really do have a lot to choose from, but I doubt if I'll try, I gag at the thought of a chili cheese burger..*eek*   Furthermore, I will be back for more fries!"}
{"text":"Wish i could give no stars. Management is unprofessional, unsanitary, and rude.  Order a sandwich took a bite, order was wrong took food back spoke to manager Ana. Most disgusting health code violation. She took my sandwich which i had already bitten. Told staff open my sandwich put correct ingredients in, gave back bitten sandwich and began preparing other orders without switching gloves. Huge health code violation. DISGUSTING. Who knows how many orders she tainted with such disgusting habits. Poor Management all around."}
{"text":"Just HOW do you run a fast food place this poorly?? I have been here 26 minutes and I'm still 3 cars away from the window. Did they just absolutely forget to train their employees? Ps it's 3:45, not in any way a rush. It took 10 minutes to get to the speaker, sat at the speaker another 8 minutes before someone came on in the quietest voice possible. I asked if a combo came with a small drink and fries how much would it be to upgrade to medium. A question they must get litterally 200 times a day. Answer: \"hold on\"  FOUR minutes later she comes back and says \"a medium drink is $2.09\" which is technically correct but in no way an answer to the question I asked. I just gave up and took the small combo.   This review took me a further five minutes to write and I haven't moved an inch. Even if this is the best burger I ever ate (who are we kidding) I will never ever ever be back.  I get the message, Rally's, loud and clear. F you, too!"}
{"text":"Was super excited to learn of this location. Although other reviews stated slow service, rude staff and bad food,.. We were skeptical to try this location. On pure convenience we chose this, and we were so glad we did. Service was great and fast! Food was just as amazing as I remembered growing up. Definitely a great spot and flashback to the great Rally's experience!! We came on a Saturday at 1PM. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"12:45am and the staff was really nice and super fast. I got the Oreo fudge milkshake. Fantastic!! You gotta get one!"}
{"text":"If there's any national promotion that Rally's has running, don't expect this location to follow or abide by them! There's currently a $1 Fries promotion that expires on June 17th per their website and social media; however their cashiers are saying the promotion had already ended. This is part for the course for this particular location, as even the coupons Rally's puts out, they will refuse to honour. Even if there is no purchase limit posted, they will refuse to budge and will only grant one item.  Their customer service is a joke, as they still haven't resolved a matter from nearly 4 months ago."}
{"text":"9 times out of 10 they always run out of food. The customer service is always crap. Usually laughing in the background when taking drive thru orders. Just all around bad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The service is par, but the food always tastes so amazing!  Every time I come here I have to order the super cup of the awesome  fries.  I recommend this place to everyone! My only suggestions is use the drive-through and then eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Slowest \"fast food\" place I've ever been. Rude employees too. I just waited in the drive through for THIRTEEN minutes and there was only one car ahead of me! This place is freakin terrible. The food is okay, but the service is so bad I won't come back."}
{"text":"I like how everyone in Cleveland Rallys around LeBron James. I'm very appreciative of that.  The sad thing is that in the old days, I thought Checkers and Rallys were something special. One of my fave things about going to Tampa, for example, was that Checkers down there would serve us up 2 for 2 chicken sandwiches and burgers and I loved them. I was a fool.  Rally's is basically the same as Checker's, they are identical but for the name. Same owners, same menu. They're in many different states, and Buffalo started getting them now. This location on the East Side of Cleveland sells cheap food late night, and some of it is passable but most of it is awful. They do have very cheap milkshakes though, including an amazing idea: snack size shakes for well under $2. The chocolate is ok."}
{"text":"No major issues they were fast, friendly, and courteous. The food was okay nothing special it was packaged a bit messy. This is my first time to a rally's and the burgers were really small (they were like the hamburger size from mcdonalds the $1 ones ) The fries  were made different and were very tasty. My son ordered a blue slushee and he enjoyed it very much. I also ordered the boneless wings and they were okay, but for me they were super spicy and again they were served messy. If I had to choose a fast food restaurant again this would not be one for me."}
{"text":"the rally's employees need to learn how to step up their game & work together and get food out timely. It's just seem like they don't have very bright people working at this location"}
{"text":"Super slow service for 10 o'clock at night.   It's been 15 minutes since we pulled into the drive thru and we just got our food.   Our teenage son loves the food but I find it repulsive."}
{"text":"I been eating rally,siknce 59th and Indian school in the hood I was glad to see they made one still west in phoenix on camelback. Frys are the same as usual the red koolaide slushie is on point. And buffallo wings and boneless are and chicken strips are all hitters.. late night is kinda when they rush u the shit but it's still all good."}
{"text":"Nice workers horrible food bad management. How do run out of French fries and bacon? Who ever orders supplies is a bonehead and should be fired."}
{"text":"Convenient location, friendly service.  Generally good food, but some items a bit over the top.  Their basic burgers are the best.  Well cooked, fresh toppings.  The basic Rally Burger is probably their best item.  Drinks are very generous, fries are interesting."}
{"text":"Best fries ever!  This location is old and needs Some TLC. Service can be slow and the drive thru is always backed up. The speaker is old so it's hard to hear the person when ordering. But the fries are wonderful. I will go here just to get the fries. Rally's offers some good deals with $2-3 meals. Can I get a \"Heck Yeah\". They do have some good burgers too. The BBQ burger is pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Usually I'd hand this place a solid 3 stars because I do like me some Rally's fries..... But I guess they were so busy they couldn't help but keep messing up the order. A side note-carpool to this location because they have a double drive thru. If you have a passenger you can take the left lane which is always faster cause no one uses it. It's like an HOV lane for food.   Ordered food for me & my employees and when I received the order it was a little light. I was missing 2 burgers & a fry. The fry was on the receipt, they just missed it but somehow they forgot to add the 2 burgers to the order, even tho she confirmed it back at the drive thru speaker. So I had to dish out some more coin and wait for them to make me some more food.   Food is decent but I guess today just wasn't their day. I won't be giving up on them but I would like to see a little better customer service & speed cause thats the name of the game race fans!"}
{"text":"630PM Tuesday Night. Pulled up, lady was nice.  I ordered the wings (Frank's hot sauce flavor ) and fries.  Waited. ...maybe 5mins? It wasn't bad wait...for wings...  I just read the bad reviews here and laughed as they handed my order, the lady was taking another order behind the guy handing my food and both apologized for the wait. It seriously wasn't, but I  appreciate the apology and he even said, everything's fresh. LoL  The sauce on the wings was delicious! I don't know how its made, but the wings had skin and it made them slime like, not like my favorite, wing stop. But who gets wings at a burger place?  Me. Who doesn't care for burgers, and just really wanted the fries. And those tasted just like I remember! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Three words: Big Buford Combo!  Ok, two more: Seasoned Fries!"}
{"text":"Any review saying that this place isn't the worst is fake. You will not spend less then 20 minutes going through their drive thru, and not to mention they always have you pull over to the front because your order isn't ready, and they always take sooooo damn long. One night my boyfriend and I got 2 milkshakes and ended up being there for 40 minutes!! The staff is very unfriendly and unprofessional and I feel like I'm talking to idiots every time I come here. Every time I use a coupon I tell them when I order that I'm using one, and then when I get to the window and remind them that I'm using a coupon they proceed to bitch at me for \"not telling them at the window\" which I did.  They give back the wrong amount of change sometimes too."}
{"text":"Awesome food and decent service. Really liked the chicken sandwich. Fries are delicious! Looking forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"They Have decent food ,I mean what do you expect from a fast food restaurant could be better but it does taste good, just take a little bit longer to grab your order if you were to order at the window, instead of the drive-thru! There tends to be a lot of people who hang out there mostly homeless people and it tends to be dirty I think with new management and new employees it will more likely succeed!"}
{"text":"We had a $40 dollar order with 4 ppl and the order was very difficult with cut burgers no pickles no this no that and food came out all CORRECT  and was amazing!!!!!!!!! Thank you staff!!!"}
{"text":"The line was fast, and considering there are 2 drive-thru's, I don't know what took them so long with these other customers that reviewed this place. The food was actually pretty crappy, although the fries were good. I probably won't go there again. You truly get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The service here is TRASH! I've literally had my order messed up time after time. And the workers take no ownership of the problem. To get a meal replacement I had to go through hoops which was so unnecessary seeing as how the mistake was made by them. All in all I love rally's, but this location is full of workers who simply don't give a damn about their work. Even down to the managers, they didn't take anything serious here."}
{"text":"Rally's is my favorite fast food joint and since they are rare to find anymore I have to stop when I visit a friend in University Heights. 3 of us went down and ordered at the takeout window.  In total we ordered 4 Burgers, 1 Chicken Sandwich, 3 Large Fries, 2 Orders of Chicken Bites, a Large Coke and Medium Banana Shake. A decent size order all bagged individually and ready in 5 minutes or less.  I was shocked at how fast this place was. And based in other reviews it doesn't seem like the norm but during our visit it was lightning quick.  The service was very friendly too.  The food was hot and fresh. I had 2 Double Rally Cheeseburgers and a Large Fry. The fries were hot enough that I had to let them cool a bit. Rally's has the best fries around in my opinion. And he burgers were excellent. My buddy loved his Banana Shake so maybe I'll try that next time. All in all it was a good experience for us."}
{"text":"On Thursday my husband went and got Rally's for dinner. Normally when we have gone its been hot, fresh, and service on point. This time he said service was slow and there was not that many cars there. Didnt give a receipt or ask if he wanted one. When he got home my double fish sandwhich which luckily I only took a small bite was undercooked and smelled old, fries cold, and even though my husband tried cooking it in the oven I still didnt feel safe to eat it cause it still smelled. I emailed a complaint and all I got was a quick response and a ticket number saying oh we will look into with managment there thanks for your input. No here is a couple coupons to get something for free, no calls from them , and their lucky I dont sue them cause if I had ate the sandwhich I got I could have gotten food poisoning. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"The service here is horrendous. Once you get your food it's pretty good but be prepared to wait 20-30 minutes for a simple burger. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"When I discovered there was gonna be a Rallys closer to home I got excited. Beforehand I read reviews and they weren't exactly flattering. Now that I came here first hand and experienced it for myself I was let down. The burger is good but doesn't hold any originality it taste like Wendy's. The fries are on point with the crispy crunchy and right balance of seasoning. My friend went with the Saharan Desert Super Dehydrated Chicken Tenders. Which I provided pictures of the what they're supposed to look like and what he got. In the end this wasn't what it used to be and adding insalt (insult) to injury the wait for refills was as long as waiting for you're pizza to get delivered. This place needs better management and a bigger crew."}
{"text":"Orders are always messed up...never remembers to give sauce, and not really sure if anyone speaks english there.. My boyfriend took 3 of us to rallys and everyone single one of us was upset with our order..my chicken was served cold, and they messed up 2 of the bacon burgers...BACON BURGERS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BACON ON THEM"}
{"text":"Hmmmm boiled beef pattys"}
{"text":"Those fries though.....Only reason we go there. I don't like the burgers or chicken sandwiches. But the fries- Yummy"}
{"text":"Before I wrote this review I read the other ones I don't usually go myself my girl goes and picks up the food for me food is always hot food is always good I cannot comment on the service but I like rally burger"}
{"text":"I am really trying to like this place but they are doing nothing to help me out. Going through the drive-thru you are forced to drive by a huge garbage bin that is usually overflowing with nasty-looking trash. Then there are the menu boards that usually have catsup or other sauce smeared across them. I once reported this to the attendant taking my order and she promised to have someone clean it up. Several days later it was still there in same spot. Last night I drove up and thought the place was closed because it was so dimly lit. I realized that it was because both menu boards were dark. I reported this to the order taker who mumbled something about having someone turn them on. They were still off when I left. Then there's the customer service. The gal last night had no idea what she was doing. I wanted the chili dog and asked her if I could have the combo. She had to ask someone what I was talking about. I guess I should have said \"Number Ten.\" DUH. When I got to the window, there was no greeting and no \"Thank you.\" When I thanked her for my order, she just grunted \"Uh huh.\" No trace of a smile. Remind me again why I go here? I guess for the $1.00 chocolate soft serve cone. But I just decided I'm giving that up for Lent.  Probably never to return."}
{"text":"I've visited this Rally's many times over the past couple of months, they're open late and I'm a night owl so it's convenient when I want something other than snacks. I've never had a problem with them getting my order correct and despite the late nights and long lines their staff is always extremely friendly and helpful. I have worked a drive-thru and food service before so I understand sometimes it may take a while to get the food but once they get me through the drive-thru I never regret going  *edit: after writing this review I checked my bank account and it said that I had been charged twice, once for my $1 ice cream cons and once for another $3 which I assume was the next person's order. However, I wasn't given a receipt so I couldn't prove the transaction was made so there wasn't anything they could do. Despite this, I went back another time and this time I asked for one moment to look at the menu and after 10 seconds a man said \"come on I'm waiting on you\" There wasn't a line, in fact I was the only person there. Not like he had anywhere else to be. 2 stars, I won't be going back and I'm sad I spoke so highly of them."}
{"text":"Ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and got half a chicken patty on it. Also ordered a bacon roadhouse and the bacon was inedible. There was no line, rally's was not busy at all at this time. Not sure why the food was so terrible when other locations are great"}
{"text":"Best fries anyone will ever eat in the history or future of ever. They are deep fried, crispy as a mother, and seasoned with awesomeness. End here, do not order further except for maybe a soft drink or something. Their burgers are baaaaaaad, not like throw it up and go to the hospital bad, but like why did I spend my hard earned money on this shit when mcdonalds is across the street? If Mcdonalds is the bottom of the barrel in burgers, then Rally's is like the sludge that settles and solidifies below that.   Their milkshakes are okie dokie I guess.  FRIES FRIES FRIES!"}
{"text":"Shake machine not working?  And no lids for small cups? Didn't they just open this place?  Annoying first visit.  I'm writting as I sit in the drive through waiting for my food window is open and I can hear the manager saying goddammit and workers swearing. I rather drive a long way to a classier Rallys I waited so long for this one to open and I'm not happy. You need professional workers."}
{"text":"Have been to this rally's multiple times and it just gets worse each time. The food is always delicious but the service is terrible. Always takes way too long even if you're the only one there. The employees are always rude and could care less about your order. The condition of the building and parking lot is horrible. Be warned there is a giant pothole as you enter the drive thru!!"}
{"text":"It's the kind of place you go to when nothing else is open or near by. The service sucks most of the time  And more than once they don't have items that they put on the  menu. They do have wings and burgers and bacon fries."}
{"text":"This place is a complete joke. I love rally's and the food but the costumer service is horrible. I've come because I love the food but every time the managers and employees ruin my experience. They are completely rude and will make you wait to order till they are done talking, give you attitude, and argue with you over everything. Don't come to this rally's the experience is horrible and unenjoyable."}
{"text":"Honestly I think the food here is great, the drive thru is usually pretty slow however, and it certainly won't win any awards for cleanliness. But I mean-it's a fast food restaurant in the heart of the ghetto, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"WOW. Worst fast food experience and worst fast food I have had in my life to-date. And I have eaten at Del Taco a few times.   I had been to Rally's a bunch growing up in San Diego, and I had decent memories until this last Sunday. Now that this location (which had looked dilapidated for some time now) was open [again?], we decided to go and check it out. Also, my boyfriend had never experienced Rally's. Realizing it was newly opened, we figured it's going to be busy but it wasn't that bad. I have seen the McDonald's down the street busier on weeknight. We waited for nearly 10 MINUTES at the drive-thru speaker just to order. After the first 6 minutes, a guy came on and asked us to give him another second and he'd be right with us. Yeah...no. I was getting really annoyed, I mean I don't mind waiting, just communicate. You have a microphone attached to your face.   When we actually interacted with the guy at the window, he was so distracted. There was even a manager there constantly at his register taking over who didn't interject or apologize or seem to be helping at all. When he went to hand us our food, he got distracted and even pulled it back, as if he messed up or forgot what he was doing, and then just sat there talking into headset, dangling our ticket-to-finally-go-home in his hands. I am like \"disengage already\"!   (Hindsight, I shouldn't have been so hasty to accept the order.)   We order two of the bacon crisp cheeseburger or whatevers and a medium fry (SEE PHOTOS). GROSS. These were like ABC burgers - already been chewed. I have had a better burger from an inner-city elementary school. And the fries, which they brag about being 'famous', were famously TASTELESS...and stale.   Anyway. I hated it. Hope you don't end up like me. If you do go, don't look at the pictures because that's not what you're getting."}
{"text":"I'm telling you, being from NY is a complete disadvantage when it comes to food in Arizona. Nothing, I mean NOTHING tastes as good as it does in NY! Anyway, it would appear that Checker's/Rally's is one of those \"don't know what you got 'till it's gone\" type of places. I always took Checker's for granted when I lived in NY and then one day in Arizona I was craving their fries and to my surprise, the only one relatively close to me was a Rally's and it was almost 45 minutes away! I mean I like their fries but I didn't 45 minute drive like them. Well, believe it or not, my husband and I had been trying to eat out less and it really only took about two weeks of home cooked meals for our bodies to adjust, I'm guessing, because this food had our stomachs twisted. Like, instant regret twisted and the food wasn't even that good!   We came here sometime last week after having ran some errands. We hadn't eaten lunch and decided to treat ourselves to fast food since we had been doing so good (lol, counterproductive but whatever). This Rally's is in the hood, y'all. I'm not bougie by any means and I know the hood has some of the best food but this area was seedy af. We ordered a checker burger with cheese meal, a funnel cake, and a 2 for $3 fry burger and fish sandwich. I didn't even make it half way through my fish sandwich because it was so dry but that's probably my fault for not asking for extra tartar sauce. The fries were just okay and that's weird because their fries are usually so bangin'! This is just one of those \"better on the east coast\" places I guess. We ordered a large and medium fry and we left most of them completely uneaten. The food was so underwhelming. As we drove home though, we started to feel it. We just felt bloated and tired and horrible, it was not worth it. I'm glad I came here to try it out since I had been craving Checker's since I moved and completely forgot to go on my trip back home but we won't be back to this location which is the only one relatively close to where we live. We'll wait until we get back to NY."}
{"text":"I was excited for this to open in the neighborhood, but I have to say i was \"rally\" disappointed. The food was awful, the fries were cold, and the burger tasted like it had been sitting there all day. I didn't even eat it, after one bite I threw it out. I hope the owners read these reviews and make some changes."}
{"text":"We were starving and so excited to get some food here. Pull up to the drive-thru and are immediately told, \"We're not taking orders for the next 20-30 minutes.\" No other explanation. 3 groups of people were eating outside. Extremely disappointed by this. Will not be coming back. I'd stay far away from this location."}
{"text":"TL;DR version - great service, great food, great experience, definitely going back.  Long version - This location just opened (hallelujah, finally a Rally Burger that isn't at least half an hour away from my house!) and they were super busy when I visited last night, but the man at the drive-thru window was very friendly, apologizing for the short wait, and the food was awesome, especially the fries, plus there are two drive-thru lanes, one of which requires the transaction to take place through the passenger's side window rather than drive's side, a welcome alternative for someone like me with a stuck-in-the-up-position driver's side window.  Hopefully without getting TOO nostalgic, I gotta say, I've really missed Rally's. There used to be one in the same parking lot as my dad's office, but it closed years ago. Whenever I can manage to visit another Rally's, I always remember visiting my dad at work and how he'd always buy me some fries if I made my best cute face.  Anyway, glad this one opened relatively close by. I'll have to take my dad ASAP!"}
{"text":"This place looks like it belongs in a war zone. Go thru the drive thru and watch for all the potholes.  I was afraid a gang member was going to walk up to my car window.  Shame on the owner of this one.  I saw a special on TV with CEO of the company...undercover boss.  He should visit this place....just shut it down."}
{"text":"I've been on the phone with my partner for the past 15 min. while he sits in line at a duel ordering station, only to be verbally assisted by what I assume was English letting him know the auxiliary ordering lane was closed. After getting back in line the sorry excuse for a teller had an attitude again. It's a fast food join, things should be simple and pleasant \"lane close\" signage would have made it easier and the low quality of customer service could have been disguised. Minimum wage, minimum service."}
{"text":"I don't know if one of the employees saw the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld and decided that emulating him was her life's calling or something, but in any case, one of the employees (who has been here a long time, unfortunately) is quite possibly the rudest cashier I've ever met in my lifetime. She hates repeating things and when we ask her to repeat what she said, she always includes a long and audible sigh. I found it particularly hilarious that she claimed to be \"busy\" with \"a lot going on\" right after she told the person to whom she was speaking on her cell phone to \"hold on\" and she gave me a very canned apology when I told her she was very rude and that I was going to contact management. I think she works on Friday nights, so unless you want to receive a nice helping of attitude with your food, you're better off going someplace else on Friday night.  It's a shame, too, because Rally's makes some amazing food. Their Double BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, fries, chili dogs, Big Bufords, and Spicy Chicken sandwiches have been consistently excellent for over 10 years; I used to live in West Park, and there was great rejoicing when they opened a Rally's on Warren Road way back in the day. Every visit to Rally's is a cause for celebration, and when the aforementioned cashier isn't there to rain on my parade, it's a 5 star establishment."}
{"text":"This location was on the CBS dirty dining list. They were advised to immediately correct their issues or legal action will be taken against the. I'd advise against this location"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst service of of ANY fast food place in the Valley..doesn't matter what time you go, they hire morons to work here. It is tragic because anywhere else you get their burgers the places are normally on point."}
