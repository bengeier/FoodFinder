{"text":"I thought the food was very good, but the dining experience was horrible.  It was a great night to sit on the patio, which is exactly what we did.  The wait for a table was reasonable.  We received a patio seat under the tree.  There were raccoons living in the tree on the patio and walking around dropping insects and pieces of the tree.  I was uncomfortable by the raccoon family (at least 6) walking around above our heads so we switched to a different table.  Later, one of the baby raccoons fell onto someone's table and plate of food - then into their lap! The raccoon was injured and running around the patio.  The mother raccoon came down to get it and both ran off, only to return later.  I found this incredibly disgusting, as raccoons are very dirty animals.  The staff found it to be adorable that the family lives there and informed us the mother raccoon has new babies every year.  They also informed us babies have previously fallen to their death from the tree during dinner hours.  This is not really the dining experience I wanted when sitting on a patio trying to enjoy my food and friends.  I was paranoid another was going to fall during our whole meal.  I would even go as far as to say I think this is an issue for the health department."}
{"text":"I moved to Cleveland about 3 weeks ago. I went here on a late Sunday afternoon to have a few glasses of wine and enjoy a nice, light meal on a patio (it was an abnormally gorgeous day).  I walked in around 6 and was immediately seated on the patio at a barrel table in the shade.  

The service was great.  I ordered a glass of Prosecco and pulled out my book.  The waiter immediately cued in on the fact that I was there to relax and enjoy the weather, and was incredibly accommodating.  The Prosecco was delicious, and after my first glass, I ordered the Pacific Rim Salad.  The vegetables were really fresh, and the dressing was pretty good as well (I ordered it on the side). 

The atmosphere was lovely.  I will definitely go back to the Wine Bar with my friends in the future."}
{"text":"We were here last night. Food was a 5, service was a 2.

I get it, it's late and no one wants to work late, but the server realllllllllly must've not wanted to be there. She was totally disinterested and gave off snobby, negative vibes from the get go. I wish I knew her name (tall brunette, bangs) but that doesn't come out when you greet EVERY table with \"ya guys want drinks?\" Ew. We love coming to this restaurant but man she threw a wrench in our moods."}
{"text":"Im finding it difficult to give this place even one star. I've been here a handful of times for happy hour which is great, but the servers are typically dismissive & inattentive. I noticed they had Brunch that was dog friendly and was excited so tried it two Sundays ago with my pups- big mistake. Could hardly flag down a host to get a seat, and when she finally did come out to us she seemed truly annoyed that we were there! Our service was very slow, and although the food was pretty tasty, the staff just seemed put out.
Today I thought, maybe I'll give this place one more shot- but once again walked onto the patio with the dogs and got a snarky response from a sour faced hostess that, \"we're not sitting people on the patio today.\"
There were other people sitting out there! I don't understand! If you do have have at least half way decent social skills do not work at a restaurant!
I will NOT be back"}
{"text":"Loved the patio!  Decent wine list.  Food was OK.  Lack of service is why we will not return - even though we are frequently in the area!  The worst service I have ever encountered!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and loved it! Select wines are $5 a glass and the back patio is awesome, there is a fireplace and trees with lights strung up. The food menu looked great and reasonably priced, I'll definitely be back to try one of the cheese boards."}
{"text":"Had a bridal shower here.  Really cool venue for this kind of event, and the food was great, but unfortunately we did not have enough food for everyone and were told we could not have more because they \"ran out\".  (We were told that they plan for each person to  have only 1/2 of a waffle, which are quite small to begin with, but our guests got only 1/4 waffle and some didn't even get any!)   In the interest of full disclosure, we did have 2 extra guests who did not RSVP and so our numbers were a bit higher than anticipated, but were shocked that a restaurant who focuses on this sort of event could not accommodate this tiny change and ESPECIALLY when we were told that they \"ran out\".

We were also charged for non-alcoholic beverages which we were told would be included as part of the overall price of brunch.    

Though the events manager kindly offered to send us a gift card for the restaurant, we were told we could NOT be refunded for the mistaken drink charges, and only got an apology about the food situation.  Seemed unprofessional and inaccurate in addition to being some pretty awful customer service.  When spending more than $500 on an event, I'd expect a service manager to be more upset about this major problem.

Though I loved the food and the atmosphere, I'd most definitely go elsewhere in the future! And if you're looking for a place to have a shower, I would only consider this place if you're flexible and OK with your guests not having the best part of the brunch! Also, over-estimate guests rather than under-estimate for sure...since apparently its too much to ask to throw about 1.5 extra waffles in a pan!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and it gets worse each time.  Service has been consistently bad each time I've been there, yet the last time was downright deplorable.  They have a large patio dining area and we were one of only 4 tables with patrons when we arrived, there were two servers and each walked by us no less that 10 times before one finally said in passing, that she would be right with us - we had been sitting without even water for 15 minutes at this point.  When she finally did come back we told her we were ready to order, but she just wanted to take the drink order and made it clear she wasn't taking the food order.  4 drinks and she messed it up - took another 10 plus min's.  When she took our dinner order, I suggested she write it down, and she said no she's remember, to which I responded 'like our drinks?'  needless to say our food order was all wrong, not one of us got what we ordered, and my food was cold and flavorless."}
{"text":"As a beer and liquor drinker, a wine bar isn't my typical spot, but this place offers all sorts of alcohol and has big-screen tvs, so it is guy friendly--being a guy I appreciate that. Wine Bar serves food from a limited menu and has a very nice outdoor patio...they'll open the overhead door on nice days and nights, creating a spacious indoor/outdoor hangout. The crowd encompasses a wide age range, in groups and the occasional couple--nice place to bring a date or find one. It draws quite a crowd on Thursdays and Fridays. Did I mention that the servers, hostesses and bartenders are gorgeous? I hear that the owners plan on opening a steakhouse nearby."}
{"text":"Great wine bar with outdoor seating, great wine selection, and a delicious menu."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, very good wine selection and food selection.  Just stopped for a glass of wine and to check it out for a future night out.  Will be back for the full experience!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my mother and brother while I was in town visiting my family. 
Wow, when I lived in Cleveland this street was just a quiet little stretch of nothing behind Mitchells Ice Cream, now it's a hoppin' block of restaurants! 

Love the indoor and outdoor seating, and the open front, we sat up front and had a nice kind of half indoor, half outdoor experience, which was perfect for the cool and lovely summer evening. 

My mother had  Pinot Grigio, and I had Chardonnay, and both were lovely and well priced. 

The cheese plate was tasty, good cheese options and lovely little accompaniments, the fresh fennel is a great touch. If you like soft, creamy cheeses try the Delice de Borgogne, you will not regret it. 

I had the mussels, my mother had the shrimp, and we split a strawberry salad, and all three were lovely. The mussels that day were sriracha and kale, and they were great. I love all of those ingredients, so it was pretty much a match made in heaven. The salad was lovely too. My brother had one of the flatbreads and was also happy.

We shared a creme brulee for dessert. The flavor of the day was creamy orange and it was also lovely. 

Noticed some people complained about the waitstaff, so just wanted to add that our waitress was lovely. Seated us immediately, came around to check on us just the right amount of times, wasn't too pushy, etc. 

Great spot, will definitely return when I'm next in town!"}
{"text":"We tried Wine Bar last night and had a great experiance. We had a bottle of the Gray Slate reisling which was excellent. We shared a cheese board, an order of truffle fried, and the mussles. All were great. The cheese board included a really delicious whipped brie, and a nice honey comb. All in all a great local spot I am sure we will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Wine Bar in Rocky River is a long awaited and much appreciated addition to the already idyllic town on lake on the west side.

Rocco Whalen, of Fahrenheit Tremont, has created an elegant, charming atmosphere which is every bit what one would expect from this powerhouse chef and savvy restaurateur.  

Wine Bar has a fantastic patio complete with pergola and abundant, beautiful outdoor seating for dining and relaxing. The grounds are landscaped and inviting and yet the atmosphere allows for casual repast.

Inside the decor promises warm and cozy conversation fireside or, perhaps, some of Rocco's delectable victuals in the dark paneled bar with luxurious granite top.

The design allows for an indoor/outdoor experience by the ingenuity of a glass \"garage\" door which opens the Wine Bar to the  warm weather.

This is the place to be and I encourage everyone to stop in to this little jewel nestled in the heart of Rocky River.

This is an update: Went for dinner and drinks Saturday night. We sat outside. It was glorious. The wine list is what I expect. Top Notch. Rocco Loves his friends in Napa and they return the favor. The flat bread pizzas were fantastic. They look like they came out of an Italian Mamma's kitchen, fresh, inspired....delicious. Wino fries, need I say more. The menu is full service, not just bar snacks, however, even the light fare is substantial enough for a meal."}
{"text":"A little disappointed in this place. They said they couldn't accomodate a party of 15 on the weekend. That their kitchen could not handle \"that many plates\". Also turned us down for a tasting on the weekend too. Sorry we basically handed you a $750 party and you turned us down. Gladly will take our business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Just through my birthday party at Wine Bar Rocky River on the outdoor (enclosed) patio this past Saturday. Wonderful food, excellent service (Len) and plenty of drinks! The staff and event planner (Megan) were thorough, organized and accomodating to all requests. I would not hesitate in chosing this location again for another party. The patio was warm, inviting and festive. Len, our personal server, made the guests feel comfortable and was timely, organized and friendly! Thank you to the staff at Wine Bar Rocky River for yet another great party!"}
{"text":"Great pattio, great food, amazing wine selections. From the moment u walk in to the time u leave...its just makes u forget u have to go back to work. Donna was our server with an answer to all our questions. Its a place u wanna try a dish at a time. Try the cheese board and u wont regret it. We'lll b back this sunday!!!"}
{"text":"Love the wine bar, especially the happy hour that starts so early! You can never go wrong with one of their $5 glasses of wine and an app after work! We sat out on the enclosed patio, which was a bit drafty, but they had a nice fire going to keep it warm. Our waiter was incredibly attentive and on top of everything. This is just a great place all around to either grab one glass of wine for happy hour or to have a meal (we once celebrated a friend's birthday there and they put us in a private room for it - super nice). It is also nice in the summer when they have the patio open, it's a nice night and the lights strung and lit up - super intimate for a date - you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Pros:  
- ambiance outside: they have a warmly lit area with some beautiful plants and a fire pit. 
- people:  the people (guests) are a cool, friendly crowd
- cheese boards aren't bad at all
- proximity to Mitchell's ice cream :) 
- good bar for watching a game

Cons:
- slow service 
- ambiance inside is lacking. 
- wines slightly overpriced but they may have happy hour deals, not sure 
- most wines (glass pours) are American.  This is standard at most bars and restaurants in CLE but I was a little disappointed with this considering it's a wine bar."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio.  Good food.  Terrible service.  We were seated promptly, but our waiter was rude to us.  He didn't even look at us when he was talking, and then refused to replace a glass of wine that had a fly in it.  After arguing, he conceded to bring out a half-glass replacement since the wine had been partially consumed already.  There are plenty of other places to go with nice patios, so I won't be in a hurry to go back to one with bad service.  We all liked the wine that we ordered, but I don't feel qualified to comment on the selection or pricing of their wine list."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Happy Hour, Brunch and a drink after dinner. I come here fairly often and they have one of the best patios around. The patio gives a certain ambiance that makes you feel swanky without the swanky price tag. You can get a glass of wine starting at $6.50 and go from there. They also offer mixed drinks and a changing variety of craft bottled beers. The menu has recently changed but I have never had an item I haven't liked. The brunch menu is great as well. 

The only warning I have is the parking lot, I have YET to be in an accident but it's dangerous going in and out of the lot."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I just wish they had a more extensive selection of WINES!  Natalie and Len are absolutely awesome. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying that my knowledge of wine is about average for anyone who actually enjoys wine on any sort of regular basis (so I guess that would make me above average in regards to the general population). Therefore, I can't really review a place named \"Wine Bar\" as critically as, well, a critic, but I can say I had a great time here. The inside reminded me of a Bavarian beer hall without the huge tables. There are snug, comfy booths and tables in the main room. The patio is very romantic, covered in twinkle lights. 

If you are looking to talk to intelligent and/or educated women over the age of 25, this is the spot to do it."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The potstickers were a delicious surprise for sure! Kelsey, you are a gem! Excellent food and extraordinary service. Thank you for having fun with us!"}
{"text":"Fun place to meet girlfriends for happy hour. I had the margarita flatbread last time I was there. Very tasty."}
{"text":"If I remember correctly, happy hour is something like 11am-4pm.  But don't quote me on that.  Went in here around 3:30pm on a Thursday (hey, I like to keep it light).  We were the only people in the place.  Extensive wine list and the food looks to be pretty good.  Parking in the lot adjacent to the wine bar is tight."}
{"text":"This review is for the food service on the patio only. I went to the Rocky River Wine Bar with absolutely no expectations about the food or service, and I was happy I went. The food was excellent and the service was charming.

It was a clear, warm day around noon and they weren't very busy. We decided to sit on the patio. Our delightful server, Olivia, was right there to take our drink orders. She proved quite apt, and the rest of our visit was made more enjoyable by her personality and service.

I ordered the hamburger, which was excellent and came with fries seasoned with lemon zest and parsley which were also excellent. My date got the mozzarella and three tomato salad and she loved it.

Overall, the experience was very nice and I would definitely come back to the Rocky River Wine Bar, maybe even to try the wine."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Wine Bar Rocky River. It is set a little bit back off the road, you almost forget where you're at.

First things first... there is a somewhat small parking lot next to the restaurant but additional parking is available across the street.

When you arrive the first thing you see is a covered patio (& an uncovered portion too) - which is perfect for enjoying a couple glasses of wine with friends (or a date)! Inside there are tables, (side note -  both inside & outside are good for groups) a few booths, and a bar area. The menu includes a variety of delicious salads (my personal favorite is the wedge salad), small bites (chicken sliders are fantastic), various flatbreads (Merguaz Sausage is a hit), sandwiches, and various other items including pot roast, poached salmon, chicken confit, & a black angus wino burger. 

The wine selection is broad as you would expect at a 'wine' bar & there is a selection of wines available from 3pm-7pm Monday - Friday for $4 a glass. Great choice for a happy hour. My personal favorite - although not available on the cheap is the red zinfandel.

The waitstaff is very chill, approachable, & knowledgeable about the selections. 

As for bathrooms, I encountered a single stall women's room that was super clean and included a large mirror and counter space perfect for setting a purse or doing a quick makeup refresh.

All in all - this place is a great find!"}
{"text":"This is such a wonderful place! My boyfriend and I had our anniversary dinner here and we had an amazing time. 

They have wine on tap inside which is neat - we were able to easily sample a few different things while waiting for a table outside. It was beautiful outside so there was no wait inside but I knew I wanted to be on that awesome patio! 

We got a bottle of wine and a cheese plate. About the only thing we didn't love were the crackers that came with the cheese, they were the kind you could get (cheaply) in the store. Not super impressive. I would have liked fresh bread or something instead but the cheese and the items that came with it were very tasty!  We also got the Wino Fries appetizer and it was delicious! Malt vinegar mayo.. heaven! 

I had the eggplant pasta entree and was blown away by it. Probably one of the most creative and flavorful eggplant dishes I have ever had. 

I can't wait to go back here! Our bill was high but we were splurging.. I'd like to go back and just get a flatbread and sip wine on the patio. It's really gorgeous and the staff were all very friendly. We had a fantastic time here. 

Oh, and I'm 23 and was definitely the youngest person here. Not an issue, just worth pointing out. It's an older crowd but I didn't feel awkward being there or anything."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for appetizers and wine. Hidden gem located just 15 min west of the city. Wine Bar is not the biggest place, but gives off a fantastic vibe and they have a full bar and patio area as well. 

Reasonably priced wine/spirits and food has been fantastic both times. Customer service was spotty last time but the servers are always friendly. 

The cheeseboard is fantastic and pairs nicely with their different wine selections. Best mussels I have EVER had. I would also recommend the Ahi Tuna Sliders which were very fresh. I look forward to trying more on the menu!"}
{"text":"One of Cleveland's hidden gems, about 15 mins from downtown.  Great patio, wine is reasonable priced, and service isn't bad either.  Good place to take a date or for a girls night out."}
{"text":"Great experience. Wonderful service and a nice ambiance! We ordered a white blend from Australia which was fruity and refreshing. Also ordered the mozzarella, grilled peach, heirloom tomato and prosciutto salad... This was fantastic. Highly recommend! The pizzas are also very good. Great for a date night!"}
{"text":"Great food and outdoor seating :) They even had live jazz music the night I went."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to my hometown of Cleveland, I ended up at Wine Bar with my very recently divorced 24 year old cousin. Keeping in mind that the only time I have ever seen him drink wine was champagne during the reception of his ill-advised wedding, I found our presence at a place named \"Wine Bar\" curious to say the least.

The patio/beer garden was charming, the bar was tasteful, and I was uncomfortable from the beginning. 

\"Why would you want to come here to get over your break-up? I was under the impression that you wanted to get semi-conscious drunk and pass out on the couch.\" I said

\"Cougars.\" responds my cousin.

Well, that this bar has in spades. Nipped, tucked, and with ex-husband's credit card in hand, ladies in their 40s and 50s frequent this place in DROVES. If you're looking for your mom's friends to buy you drinks, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Granted, I'm not a wine person. But after a good experience at CLE Urban Winery on the East Side, I was looking forward to this. I'm going to give the flight a fail. I asked them to surprise me, confessed my limited palate/knowledge/experience, and just said to keep price in the mid-range. I ended up with all reds and they all tasted vinegary. 
Moving in to the food, it was jus meh. Our group was there on a Sunday at the tail end of brunch. I ordered the Vegetable Scramble, which comes with potatoes. The omelette was meh, kinda blah. The potatoes weren't seasoned and had a texture I can only guess is indicative of their past life in a freezer. 
Our server was nice, and the atmosphere was very wine cellar-ish with lots of wood. Parking in the back was easy. They do have Vegan & GF options."}
{"text":"It was a pretty good hang out for a girls night.  My friend Catherine took me there there for the first time.  I had a glass of Reisling and a glass of their sweetest red.  (I had to drive so I had to cut myself off after 2 :( )  

The Brie Avocado Bruschetta was really good with plenty of tomatoes- it was a good combo of the sweet, savory, and salty.  It went deliciously well with Reisling.  We had their Savory plate with the red wine- the ale cheddar (THE BEST, CREAMIEST CHEESE I HAVE EVER HAD).  I wasn't a fan of the blue cheese or their soft Swiss.  The salami was really good and filling; however, it was a little too greasy for my tastes.  I wasn't crazy about their cracker pairing with the coldcuts and cheese though.

The atmosphere was cutely decorated with wine barrels and grape vines. With a rustic Italian villa feel to it with the stucco on the walls and the wine crates used as wall covers all over.  

I was really disappointed that they didn't have any Robert Mondavi- particularly any OPUS ONE (I LOVE LOVE LOVE OPUS ONE- i would sell my kidney for a good vintage).  The Reisling was extremely sweet- almost on the border line of a dessert wine for my tastes.  The red was had an overly bitter bite at first tastes and mellowed out as it moved around the palate.  It was even worse when we ate the cheese before drinking the red.  

The service was relatively attentive yet not overbearing and he was helpful in narrowing our wine selections.  However, there would be times where we would be out of wine and water, waiting for the waiter to come back with more drinks.  

For 2 glasses of wine and 2 appetizers we spent 32.00 each, which is bad, but it isn't great either.  

I was also surprised at their small wine selection.  I have been to restaurants with a comparable wine selection in comparision to theirs before.  However, their delicious appetizers certainly compensate for their selection.  It gets three stars because of the ehh wine selection and relatively good food."}
{"text":"Typically I NEVER have anything negative to say about this establishment. That being said, today I was very disappointed in the tomato salad that I ALWAYS order.... Touted in the description with heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella, shaved prosciutto, basil AND grilled peaches. Who wouldn't want that?!? So to be served my \"regular\" and find canned, never touching the grill peaches ( in the PEAK) of peach season was incredibly disappointing and baffling. It won't make me not come back as I love this establishment, but a WILL remind them that the peaches should be grilled, and when in season should be absolutely fresh... Just sayin"}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service. I went in for lunch with my family and  grandmother with hearing aids. The food was absolutely wonderful and we all cleaned our plates. However, our server was short and quite rude, she was not attentive at all. We were sat near the kitchen door and could hear their rap music blaring the entire meal. My grandma has trouble hearing and her hearing aids pick up background noise. She asked the waitress if they could turn it down and the waitress looked shocked and snapped at her saying \"You want me to tell them to turn it down?!\" She then ran to the kitchen and screamed loud enough for us to hear for them to turn it down. We didn't see her for another 15 minutes til when she came back and dropped the check on the table and left again. Overall, we loved the cute atmosphere of the place and the wonderful food but the service ruined the experience."}
{"text":"I like the Rocky River Wine bar and there's never a shortage of wine! :)

This place has some decent eats too.  On my last visit my friend and I split a bottle of red and she ordered the Lamb 'za.  Pretty tasty!  

I haven't ever had a bad experience here.  I love coming during the week when it is a little less hoppin' but this place is great no matter when.  Come during the summer too and experience the lovely patio!

I think you'll find something here...and if not, you can walk your sorry self to Mitchell's for some ice cream to cheer you up."}
{"text":"This spot is a hidden gem! Literally hidden off of the road, this cozy restaurant has an amazing atmosphere with string lights outside/ outdoor seating area. Their wine menu includes anything and everything and their menu has plenty of options from salad to pizza to nice entrees such as scallops. My boyfriend and I shared two appetizers, the pork meatballs and the chicken lettuce wraps. The wraps had a hearty amount of chicken in them and were pretty good! Wasn't too crazy about the hot sauce included, but the soy sauce to dip it in was good. The pork meatballs were bomb with a little baguette to eat them with! Additionally, we were still slightly hungry so we shared a four cheese flatbread with plenty left over! The pizza was amazing, I would definitely go back to this place in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere in the summer.  The patio is amazing.  Prices are a bit steep for what you get.  The cheese platter appetizer is really good though.  It comes with a hunk of honeycomb....nice touch!  I'd like to see some live music here....but so far I've not encountered any.  Also, parking can be a bit frustrating.  But for the atmosphere alone, its definitely worth it.  Nice place to just go and sit for conversation."}
{"text":"This is favorite bar in the Rocky River/ Lakewood area hands down. The bartenders are great people and the food is fantastic. I've tried maybe 5 different dishes so far and each one was pretty darn good. The fireplace is a great feature in the winter and the patio is awesome to have in the summer. April is awesome, Jason is awesome, they're all good people. Great place for a date."}
{"text":"Patio is amazing as well as the 4 seasons room! The menu changes seems with the season which is nice. It's quaint and everyone always seems like they're enjoying themselves when they're working which says a lot about a place! Service is good 90% of the time but don't go when it's super busy as service seems to be very slow and staff sometimes overwhelmed. All in all tho, it is one of my go to places!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Depends on the server and chefs. Was a regular for over a year until the bartender decided he liked us enough to never leave us alone to enjoy ourselves, and thought it was ok to complain about his employer, kitchen staff, manager, and customers (uhm, hello, I'm a customer. Not the brightest bulb I've ever met) 

That being said, he is my biggest issue with this place lately. The food is usually amazing although sometimes off key. The menu changes regularly (thumbs up!) without taking away fan favorites (two thumbs up!). Decent wine list. Never had a cocktail that was well made. It is a wine bar after all."}
{"text":"THE UP-SIDE:  Wine Bar in Rocky River is a welcome addition to the West Side.  It offers a fine selection of wine, a pretty decent menu, and some nice atmosphere.  There are three main seating areas, each with a unique character.  

The indoor bar seating area is reminiscent of a your average microbrew bar.  With lots of room, a long bar, and deep booths, this area has the most activity and can be a little loud at night.

The indoor fireplace area is smaller, quiet and perfect for a first date over wine.  With the fireplace roaring, this is my favorite area.

The outdoor patio is really nice, and a perfect fit for the quiet surroundings.

THE DOWN-SIDE:  As mentioned, the indoor bar area can be a little loud at night.  

THE SUM-IT-UP:  The Wine Bar in Rocky River isn't my favorite wine bar in Cleveland, but it does provide a welcome addition to this side of town.  Go here for a perfect first date and sit close to the fire.  Good stuff.  :-)"}
{"text":"Food was good and the atmosphere outside is awesome! The server was non-existant. I had to go find her to order our second round of drinks. We had empty glasses for 10+ minutes. I had to go find her to order our entrees. I had to wave her down twice to get our water glasses filled. I had to go find her to pay for our bill.wasn't because they were overly busy. One time she was sitting at bar talking with her server friends."}
{"text":"Can't beleive I haven't written a review yet. I've recommended to so many people. Wine bar is an exceptional slice of the west side. Good wine. Good service. Great brunch.

Most recently I had stopped in with a friend for dinner after work. We were supposed to make it to a movie right after but dinner kept us a little too enticed for a little too long. Not a bad thing at all. 

Chose a wine, Gewurztraminer, for my friend -- and a tasty beer, of which its name escapes me, for myself. 

We then couldn't decide on sweet or savory cheese plate. In the end the answer was both. Why deny ourselves a bevy of cheeses along with sweet relishes, fruits, salami, and yes, prosciutto. Next up, entrees. Well we'll call them small plates as my belly was already full of cheese. Her choice: Chicken, bacon and ranch flatbread. Simple, flavorful, and fun. My choice: Pork belly with honey, almonds, and greens. Good flavor when everything was combined. I think the pork was a bit overcooked. Glad they offer it though as not many restaurants, especially in Cleveland, would make that kind of a dish. 

Overall we had a great night. Service was very good, our waitress was friendly and informative. Left almost full and a bit buzzed. Success!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place for a drink out on the patio. Great wine selection and great plates of food to share. The service can be a little slow, which can be frustrating, but it's always busy, so I'm sure that's why. Definitely  sit outside, inside can get kind of loud. Totally an example of why I love the westside."}
{"text":"Just went again to wine bar in Rocky River and my life has changed! I went with the exact meal I ordered last time - the best sauce put on calamari I have ever had, and the most delicious Asian salad ever! 

This time my friend and I decided to splurge for desert and order the S'more Lava Cake - it honestly changed my life! It was soooooo good and just the perfect end to a meal when we split it.  It is a lava cake covered in toasted marshmallow and graham cracker and then I believe in addition to the chocolate lava there is a little bit of marshmallow in the middle.  I have been dreaming about it all day and already want to go back.  It is so reasonably priced for a dessert to.  

If you go - you MUST get dessert!"}
{"text":"As other reviewers state, this restaurant has great ambiance. If you like outdoor dining, the patio is really special. But I guess I'm odd because I actually come for the food. A friend came with me and decided to order 3 different appetizers at $5.00 each since it was happy hour. I was able to sample two of them, one being the pork meatballs. Yuck! neither of us liked them. Very very dry. Another choice was the truffle fries which were average. As for me, I ordered one of the salads, can't remember the name of it but it was Asian style. It also was average. Also, our server didn't pay much attention to us and it wasn't all that busy. So if I'm in the mood for more average food and mediocre service I might come back."}
{"text":"I had such a great dinning experience here last evening! I came with some friends on a busy Friday night. We grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. We were sat in under our expected wait time. The restaurant has dimmed lighting and candles in the center of the table which creates such a cute environment to sit and try new wines with friends or a date night. They have an extremely great and extensive wine selection by the glass or bottle. Everyone enjoyed their food as well. The staff is friendly. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Here is why.

First time: I was out on the \"west side\" checking out boutiques and my friend and I saw WINE BAR and made a sharp right down the twisted driveway to the enchanting restaurant. It was very romantic. We shared a bottle of wine, the Baby Spinach Salad (yum!) and the Bruschetta. Since the Wine Bar was fairly new it wasn't too crowded so it was perfect!

Since: I have been there on reunion nights with my high school friends sitting on the patio in the summer and most recently was there last weekend with my mom. She has been dying to try it and I knew it was close so we went for dinner. The menu changes from time to time which is nice. This time-again we split the salad and something new to me-we tried the Black Bean Raviolis. They were delicious!!!

From the girls at the door to our waitress-I am never disappointed. Wine choices galore and an excellent menu, I will be back! Anyone heading out to Rocky River I am sure to recommend the Wine Bar!!!"}
{"text":"I had a nice visit at the Wine Bar Rocky River, in Rocky River, Ohio.  This was my first visit here, and I was initially impressed with the wonderful ambiance.  Upon entry, one thing that immediately came to mind was that I wished my wife was with me because this restaurant would be perfect for a date.  
 
The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating available.  Since it was a beautiful evening, I opted for the outdoor seating at a small but cozy table under the beautifully-strung overhead lighting.  There were a few other parties nearby also enjoying the outdoor experience.  
 
This restaurant has an excellent selection of wines and main entrees along with a wide variety of appetizers.  I walked in thinking I'd get something more classy, but the signature burger and fries sounded simple and delicious.  It was amazing.

My waitress was attentive throughout my experience, and checked on me regularly to make sure I was satisfied.  Although she was quite professional, she lacked the friendliness that I would have preferred and she seemed rather introverted.  

Overall, I enjoyed my experience at the Wine Bar Rocky River.  This is a solid four-star restaurant, and it could be a five-star restaurant with subtle improvements."}
{"text":"Frequent this place ALOT.  Was able to enjoy the outside patio this time around.  Great wine selection and food."}
{"text":"I am looking forward to giving this place a 5 star rating when: 
1) I'm actually planning on coming here and don't just come one a whim
2) Can actually try the food
3) It is nicer outside so I can enjoy the patio properly

That being said this place was still pretty impressive. My date and I came here on a whim after seeing a movie so we could chat a little more and grab a couple glasses of wine. While the by-the-glass wine list wasn't very extensive there were some very good choices and they were also pretty reasonably priced. 

Also, I have to note that while you can't get a glass of a lot of the wines, you can sample quite a few of the bottles for about a dollar and some change which is a great feature that not a lot of wine bars have, definitely takes a little of the guessing out of getting a bottle that you haven't had before.

We were seated in the patio area by the fire place which was cozy and also very romantic in the least cheesy way possible. The decor was tasteful but a little rustic, it reminded me of places in Colorado in ski towns that are upscale but hip and a little outdoorsy. I imagine the patio space would be absolutely heavenly in the summer.

The service was great, really attentive and the two selections we got (a wine from Valpolicella, and one called the improvisor) were pretty good, we definitely enjoyed the Valpolicella one better but we didn't ask for recommendations so the fault is our own. 

All in all, it was a great experience and I definitely want to come back and check out the food."}
{"text":"Adorable AF! I can't believe it took me as long as it did to finally get around to trying this place. My mom and I went for lunch after spending the day shopping in Rocky River and it was  the perfect end to a great day. 

Their space is so cute with wooden booths/ bar tables. I am kicking myself for not going in the Summer...their outdoor seating/ patio looked darling. There was a backroom that looked like a shower was going on in. Great option for a small gathering! 

We both had the Asian salad which was exactly what we needed after working up an appetite, but not wanting to eat too much. Great salad! We ordered the truffle fries and split them...sinfully tasty.I will for sure be going back ASAP."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere which was matched by warm and friendly service.  Sat at the bar around midnight,  had some small plates, all of which were very good.
Chickpea tacos and their homemade, freshly cut potato chips (which I normally would never order, but, now kind of crave) were nice. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very friendly and the food was awesome.  Pulled pork flatbread and pork taco's highly recommend.  Wine was superb!
A+++++"}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the years.  Sat in both the dining room and the bar..  Great appetizers.  Nice summer patio.   Once I had dinner in the \"tent\" in the winter that was set up and the noise level was almost unbearable.   Other than that... a good late night wine spot."}
{"text":"The goat cheese fondue is amazing. The ahi tuna sliders were also pretty damn good. I got the burger but it wasn't anything too special. Extensive wine list obviously. I don't know if I'd go back again, but definitely advise to try it at least once."}
{"text":"cutest patio ever! A really good hang out place with friends in the summer. I ordered white wine and sparking wine and loved both. Had hummus with my drinks and it was really tasty too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a wonderful Place.  The
Service was great,. Food was excellent.  
A peaceful relaxing restaurant.  For warmer weather outside they have a relaxing fire pit. It was an enjoyable evening.  Can't wait to go back.  
As we were walking out the owner thank us .....I was so impressed and felt appreciated...."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing, great wine selection and the food was very good. It is definitely one of my favorite restaurants now. I can't get over how beautiful this place is."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, great selection of wines. Maybe add some foliage on the patio to enhance the mood."}
{"text":"Solid wine selection and friendly staff. My entree was definitely a disappointment however....my steak was not medium rare, it was medium well. The dish definitely underperformed on all levels...I'd recommend this place for wine and small plates."}
{"text":"Hi, my name is Cara and I have a wine problem. 

Well, it's not a problem per se, it's an undying love for anything vino. This includes the feeling, taste and the light bites that often come along with it. So, yes, this includes wine bars like the gloriously cozy one in Rocky River. 

I'm not sure how you could have a bad experience here. Feed me wine, cheese, flat breads and other noshies and I'm golden. Place me in front of a toasty fire in the wintertime while all this consumption is happening and you've just upped the ante, big time. 

All the nibbles I've had--delicious. All the wines I've tried--picked carefully and thoughtfully by the knowledgeable staff. Service? No complaints here. On top of it all, this west side wine bar is well equipped for all seasons with a gorgeous outdoor patio. You just can't go wrong. 

I actually really appreciate the smaller size of this establishment. It's lends well to intimate conversations and a more personal experience. 

So yeah, when I'm on the west side of Cleveland... you very well might find me here with a group of my girlfriends or on a cozy date with my man. Try it, lighten up a little and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Wine Bar! this is mine and my mother's favorite spot to catch up and relax on a patio. We have always had excellent service and food that is to die for! We always struggle with what to order because we want to try everything but love what we've ordered in the past!"}
{"text":"This place makes me not want to hate on the suburbs so much.  It is a fantastic place to go - especially in the summers.  They have one of the best patio's I've seen in the Cleveland Area, and it really creates an ambiance that is relaxing and enjoyable.  

I would choose WBRR if you want to be able to have a conversation with those you are with during the dinner hours, but would warn that it becomes more of a trendy hangout/bar later in the evening. 
 
Food = good, drinks = good ... Wine Bar Rocky River - goooooooood!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite hangout to go to in Westlake or Rocky River. Looking for a great place to do Girls Night? Try Wine Bar! 

I've been here more than a handful of times and visited this evening. The waiters and hostess were genuine and friendly. My two girlfriends and I enjoyed a delicious bottle of Californian Reisling for $23, a lamb quesadilla, and Brie Avocado Bruschetta (apparently, this is their top seller).  I loved our wine and my quesadilla! I've also had some of their salads, flat breads, and burgers and know I've really enjoyed every thing I've eaten here. 

The patio (in the summers) is adorable and was so charming with it's Christmas lights today as well. I always feel comfortable and cozy hanging out here. It's definitely a Cleveland Favorite!!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness we have been here before to know that this place can be great. The food today however was totally burnt ( potstickers, hamburger) and Cuban was  dry, no sauce. Hope that this will improve fast. We love your patio and menu but we expect food that is eatable. Please work on helping your chef to put out good food."}
{"text":"I love Rocky River wine bar! I have been here for happy hours and dinners and both have been great experiences. If you go in the summer they have the cutest outdoor patio, and part of it is covered. True to a wine bar they have a great wine menu with a wide selection. However, for the beer fans there is also a pretty large menu. I've been a fan of all of the food items I've tried here and I enjoy trying something different everytime I come here. It's the perfect place for a date night or drinks with friends. I do want to try the Brunch here as well."}
{"text":"Wine bar has become one of my \"go to\" restaurants!
I absolutely love the outside patio. They string lights outside which gives it a very warm and romantic feel. They also have a great selection of wine.
Most importantly the service is always super quick and attentive! 
I always get the bread service.... IT'S SOO GOOD!!!! It comes with warm bread and a side of honey butter, rosemary hummus and olive tapenade. On our last visit we had the mussels on special which were very savory and tasty. I had the crab cake sliders and my husband had the potstickers. The sliders were awesome, I would definitely recommend. 

I just love this place and intend to go back many times this up coming summer!

Ask or sit in Alexis's section she's amazing!"}
{"text":"Had my daughter's bridal shower here.  Overall venue was nice, food was delicious.  However, be careful when picking this venue - I would suggest no more than 25 guests for the covered patio - otherwise tight fit and difficult to move around.  Secondly, the catering manager (Megan) did not make an appearance so keep that in mind - Given the costs I just assumed she would make an appearance to check on things.  We were told there would be menus at each seat (we even went over the bride and groom's name for the cards in person with Megan) but alas no menus, no Megan, no luck.  Good place for small parties, assuming it doesn't rain.  If it does, you will be put inside with the public and will not be happy so make sure the weather will be dry!

Rather expensive with no personal service so choose wisely!"}
{"text":"It's funny that I haven't been to Wine Bar RR until just this week. Been in CLE for a LONG time, try to hit places that I hear about, but never got around to this one. After a few hours on a friend's boat at the marina the 6 of us stopped by for dinner. Too bad a downpour closed the outdoor dining section-what a cozy venue. The indoor bar room was nice as well-dark woods, casual but nice, lots of booths. While waiting at the bar I couldn't help but notice the copper cups on a backbar shelf. Must be the power of suggestion but I ordered a great Moscow Mule while waiting for our table. Food was very good, well presented and our service was excellent. The best a reviewer can say is that they will return - and I certainly will do that, particularly for the outdoor patio,"}
{"text":"I really wish I liked this place more since I happen to live very close by and my other go-to places are tartine, salmon Dave's and Georgetown grill. So before the others start thinking that I have a drinking problem I would love to add one more place I love to the list. 
But the sad truth is that I only ended up going there only once this year on a beautiful sunny day when friends suggested to meet up there. 

The patio is great! If you live in the area I feel like there is no better place to have a nice glass of wine outside except at tartine. 

The wines I have chosen and have been served there were always good but then I usually know what I would like to order, which grape from which region etc.

I have never ordered food there so I cannot review any meals but I always thought that the menu looked ok for a wine bar. 
Seems like a good variety of stuff to pick on that can accompany your wine. 
After all for me personally what I expect from a wine bar most is good wine and atmosphere. 
 
And that is exactly the problem. Inside there is no atmosphere at all. Well maybe that of a sports bar. 
It is not cozy at all, not sexy, modern nor romantic. 
If you'd make it a bit nicer inside I'd be back in a jiffy to check it out."}
{"text":"I recommend the rocky river wine bar for small groups of people who are looking for intimate and intelligent conversation. Preferably two people. I've always had the best time with only one other person. The wine list is more than adequate for someone who is slightly less than a connoisseur. The ambiance is romantic and intimate. Ive always been there late at night and the service has been prompt and informed. The bartenders seem more knowledgeable than the wait staff. Around  seven to eight dollars for a large serving of wine. Not bad. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was under whelming and for a wine bar the wine selection was lack luster. The bar service was pathetic no personality. If they get a more lively staff and a better wine selection worth going again but I'll pass on food."}
{"text":"The Wine Bar Rocky River nestles behind the buildings fronting Linda street and this quiet location provides one of the finest patio seating experiences in town.  The wine selection is excellent, and when we went for lunch, their salads were outstanding.  I had the grilled salmon salad and was delighted with a lovely piece of firm, perfectly grilled salmon on a bed of greens lightly dressed with a tangy balsamic.  My lunch partner had the duck confit salad, which was also delicious.

The real treat here, though, is a weekly wine tasting event they call \"Flight School.\"  Every Wednesday at 6pm this tasting matches 5 2-ounce pours of wine with five small plate accompaniments.  Each week the wines and the foods change.  

This is not just an ongoing advertisement for their regular menu.  The chef creates special dishes for each tasting, so you will get to experience great food that's really special.  Every dish we had was delicious, and the wine pairings were outstanding.

Best of all? This event only costs $20 per person.  A 20% gratuity is automatically added to the bill, but we did not object to paying it as the service was attentive and friendly.

Reservations are required because the events fill up quickly.  We will definitely be returning, and often."}
{"text":"Had my sister in laws bridal shower here yesterday. The food was excellent and the wine was good. The staff was extremely helpful and was there whenever we needed something. I have no complaints other than it was a little difficult to find. Google maps was no help at all, the sign was a little small. We parked down the street and ended up walking after having to turn around a few times. It was a nice event. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The place is fantastic for summer nights on the patio. I might actually totally relocate there once  Cleveland winter (all 6 moths of it) ends. 
In winter it's a bit crowded and loud. Something is missing. And not only summer. Maybe they need more candles, softer booths, less light, better music, I am not sure. 
However I never had a horrible experience there. I just never felt \"loved\" there, but I am a very spoiled customer to begin with.
 They do have really good wine selection, tasty salads and nice service. And once they stop over salting calamari  I promise to upgrade them to 4 starts."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I had the tuna tacos and they were amazing. The service however made the whole experience horrible. We had a server that was so inattentive and didn't even care that she made our experience horrible. She would bring out drinks that we ordered in the beginning after the good came and we basically had to pray that she would come back in time for us to have an order placed or even to pick up the check. Definitely not giving this lack of service place our money again."}
{"text":"Wine bar is one of my go-to places for girl's night. Whether we are out on the patio in the summer or inside relaxing at a booth in the winter, I always feel at home. I prefer it to the wine bar at Crocker Park because the atmosphere is more casual and because they have more food options. I can't say I've loved everything I've had here (wasn't wild about the risotto balls and the desserts have been just ok) but I love their cheese and meat board options. Flatbreads are always a good option too. Service, much like at their sister restaurant Market down the street, can be slow and/or just plain flippant. We had a server here once that actually told us he was really more of a craft beer guy and hence didn't have strong opinions about wine. Just one occasion. Great wine selection (although I'm not picky, I just like to see a variety of prices and varietals) but I agree that food is a tad overpriced."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out but they don't know how to run the business, or maybe they just don't need more customers. Called the place to make a reservation for 18 people, they said we can't, you need to do it online and someone will contact you. I filled out the online form and the next day they emailed me saying we don't take reservations, you need to call the restaurant and arrange for seating. 
Not going through more hoops, I'm sure other places will be more than happy to accommodate us."}
{"text":"Wine Bar hosted my rehearsal dinner a few months ago and did an outstanding job! Created a Tuscan themed buffet for my guests. Came up with options off menu to fit my requested theme. The food was delicious. And the service was on point. Love Wine Bar's food and will never hesitate to recommend for a private event."}
{"text":"Love this place. Has an awesome outdoor setting. Their plates are smaller portions but amazing! Better in the summer but just as good in the winter!"}
{"text":"Although the patio and food are nicely done, the customer service is POOR!  We had a half glass of red wine spilt on an expensive shirt by our server, Len.  Not only was the glass not complimentary after that, but a new glass was not offered.  Furthermore, the only way this accident was addressed, was with a very rude statement of \"if the stain doesn't come out, call me tomorrow and we'll see what we can do.\"  We understand that accidents happen, but that is unacceptable and poor service!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"SUCH a fun place! I go with my parents whenever I'm home. My dad isn't much of a wine guy, but my mom and I LOVE wine, and we're always able to find something that all three of us like"}
{"text":"Food was beauitful presented, atmosphere was welcoming, however due to the quaility of the food, it was not worth the price."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot with a great wine selection and good food. We tried a bottle of the Malbec called La Posta Pizzella and it was very good. For under $30 it was fantastic. I tried the Ahi tuna sliders which were very fresh, The seasoned fries they serve it with are great too! They give you a pretty big portion of fries which is a plus.

It did take awhile for our server to come take our order but we weren't in a rush so It wasn't a big deal. She was also great at recommending a good bottle of wine. The atmosphere here is very nice and I love the big booths they have. This is a great place to sit for awhile, catch up with friends and enjoy a nice bottle of wine. I'm glad Rocky River has a great spot like this!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so romantic and the patio is perfect for a summer night! I can't say enough good things about this little wine bar. Service was top notch. We shared the bruschetta as an appetizer. I had the summer berry salad, hubs had the soup du jour (sweet potato and chorizo... Um, amazing). We shared the chorizo flatbread for dinner. The perfect location on the west side for a date night or to go out with the girls. The decor on the inside is rustic and chic. I can't wait to come back and spend another summer evening on the patio!"}
{"text":"I went to the Wine Bar Rocky River, yes that is the name not the reverse, this weekend. Initially I was impressed with the overall size and the different environments that they have created. There is a lot of outdoor seating (it was winter but I saw the patio space) and then they have three interior rooms. Upon entering the main area, we were greeted by a lovely lady who was quick to get us seated. She cleared off a high top table and secured it for us even though a couple of other people were quick to swoop in and try to take it. The atmosphere was nice, wine and food selection was also great. I only had wine that night but will return for food and drinks. One great surprise it seems their kitchen is open to 2am!! These types of places are rare to find in Cleveland. 

Here is where the stars start falling off my rating... 

The server assigned to our table was curt, unplugged and rude. She quickly took our wine order and my side of club soda. I asked her the difference between two types of Zins and her response was..\"oh that one is better\"....\"better\" in wine descriptions doesn't go very far in helping describe the wine. I didn't want to Tango with this server so I just said \"ok\" to the \"better\" wine. She was quick to bring our wine...and barely made eye contact and completely forgot my club soda and she whipped by so fast, there was no point in telling her. She did stop by much later on to see how we were doing but we were so put off my her lack of friendliness there was no point asking her for anything. When we finally asked for the bill, she brought the bill and flop it on the table with an outstretched arm god forbid she would actually have to walk up to the table and stop for a moment, gave an insincere \"thank you\" and left. There was a MUCH friendlier male server whom we looked at other tables he was assisting with \"server envy\". 

The other factor which dropped off a star was the noise....the later it became, the noise level rose in the \"main\" room we were in. 

I will definitely go back, try a different server and different room and see if Wine Bar RR can earn some stars back."}
{"text":"What happened  to the menu? Appitzer selection  is horrible.  I used to love this place. So many new restaurants in River...tons of choices. Until the menu is changed I would skip this place."}
{"text":"First time to the rocky river wine bar.... Great service! Amazing patio area, inside area is small. Great service, small beer and drink selection a larger wine menu. The food was decent. Worth a try, a mix between a upscale wine bar and Your local bar. 3.5 stars !"}
{"text":"I may be a little biased since this is in stumbling distance from my house, but I think this is one of the nicest patios to spend a summer evening on with a frosty beverage. It's smack in the middle of Rocky River's \"downtown\" but traffic and passerby noise (with the possible exception of the faint din of rug rats coming from Mitchell's) largely disappears because it's set back from the road.  In less lovely weather, the inside is warm and welcoming. 

The menu has gone through some evolution, but it appears to have settled into a good formula of starters, salads, small plates, and entrees. A couple of the items they opened the place with have sadly disappeared (multiple dipping sauces for the calamari, and the creme brûlée flight) but I still love their food for the most part. Their wino fries with Cabernet ketchup stand out, as well as a good assortment of flat breads to soak up the wine. 

I am far from a wine expert, but I never have trouble locating something good to drink with the help of a server. They seem to be fairly versed in all of the offerings. The Wine Bar also has a smallish but well-chosen beer list and some nice liquors. 

Service is generally good, but I have had a couple of instances where servers vanish for long periods of time. 

While I agree with a previous reviewer's pointing out that there may be a few cougars to be found here, this is far from Viagra Triangle material, thankfully. The crowd is diverse and laid-back, with most parties coming to eat and drink and socialize rather than to be seen."}
{"text":"I think its strange that their name is Wine Bar Rocky River instead of Rocky River Wine Bar.  I also enjoy their website name - winebarrr.com.  Surely that is winebar and then rr for \"Rocky River\", but when I read it, my ye ol' speakin' pirate side takes over and says it like \"Wine Barrrrrgh!!\""}
{"text":"This is my favorite wine bar in town by far. Great wines, good food and super knowledgeable and friendly staff. One of the best patios in the area with plenty of seating. We especially liked the cheese board. They are open later during the week than a lot of places too which is nice."}
{"text":"Mac n cheese is a must!!! Spicy cheesy bacon bowl spoon mouth MUST!  House burger with truffle fries  is another must!  Our server hit spot on with both of those recommendations. We will be going back. Celebrating the wife's birthday we indulged in a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and dessert. I let our server know that something chocolatey and gooey was what my wife deserves and she brought us the exact definition of it: a S'mores bomb. Chocolate cake oozing with gooey goodness carefully caressed by a toasted marshmallow fortress. 

The flat bread left plenty to be desired steer clear and order 2 of something else. 

So good. So happy."}
{"text":"I have gone here multiple times and have always enjoyed it. IT has such a fun bar and backyard patio to meet up with friends during the summer. They have a great offering for brunch along with a perfect happy hour. It is a wine bar so they have a huge selection of wine but also have additional alcohol selections.

The food is delicious, a little pricey, but that is the only thing I can say. It is a great place for a date, a friend fathering or just a girls night out. Always is perfect for special occasions like wedding showers which I have seen multiple times happening there. This is a great location to grab a bite or even just a drink and some apps in the heart of Rocky River, just a short drive from downtown."}
{"text":"The Wine Bar has a great atmosphere. In the summer months, the patio is a great place to hang out and have a couple glasses from their great selection of wine. I love a place where you can tell the waiter what you like, and they bring you a glass of exactly what you were in the mood for. 

I was here for a work function most recently, and they were great. All of the food was delicious! What stuck out most was mini reubens and curry chicken on pita. The whole group couldn't get enough. 

I definitely have \"Flight School\" on my list of things to do where you can try samples of different wines. Wine Bar would be great for girls night out too!"}
{"text":"I think that Wine Bar Rocky River is experiencing an identity crisis. Here's why:

When you think \"Wine Bar,\" you certainly conjure up images of something quite like this place; dim and sexily lit...fireplaces...very nice date-night or event atmosphere. 

The music, however, was...surfing music? In the middle of winter...I distinctly remember thinking: \"How weird that they're playing the Beach Boys in a wine bar...\"
Similarly, the staff was dressed very casually, the service was very slow and the prices didn't seem to match the quality of food. 

I also find restaurants who deny its customers complimentary bread to be stuffy and stingy. =(  I was very sad with no bread. =( 

Like I said, not a terrible experience, just what seemed to be the restaurant equivalent of an identity crisis. Nothing memorable about this experience, which is what delayed my review for months on end. All I remember is that I don't remember much, and therefore probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This Wine Bar has the best patio in Rocky River.  It's quaint and lovely.  They have a good selection of wines for both my husband and I who like white and red respectively.  My only complaint is that I wish they served flights.

The food also is very good.  While we didn't eat this past visit, I have had the flat iron steak and it was delicious.  The cheese boards are also a good choice, as well as the flat bread pizzas, which are always winners.  

I've also had private events here for work and the staff is MORE than accommodating."}
{"text":"I've been to WBRR a few times, but never really appreciated it until last Tuesday afternoon when a friend met me after I got out from a tough day at work. It was practically empty, just a few groups of 2 or 3 scattered around. These people REALLY know their wine. And the food is pretty tasty too. Columbia Crest Cab is superb - and I should know I drank most of a bottle :) 

Chill place to just sit and talk with one friend or many. We laughed, we cried, and when we did, the bartender brought us some Kleenex. Gotta love a place like that."}
{"text":"I wanted to recommend Rocky River wine bar for any small event that you may be having. I had my daughter's wedding shower there this weekend and it turned out perfect. Lisa and April the servers were helpful,  calming took care of everything so I could enjoy the day. The food was outstanding. Everybody really enjoyed their self and I'll think of them again for any event."}
{"text":"I love everything about this wine bar! From the romantic atmosphere with your hunny, or a girls night out on the back patio. There is not one bad item on the menu, and the cocktails and wine selection is phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE...did I say I LOVE this place!

Nice little hidden gem with an amazing patio, great service, amazing wine and fantastic food. They have a great happy hour which is honored throughout the restaurant and the patio. I've never once been disappointment with this location and I frequently go here."}
{"text":"Dear Summer,
Please return quickly so I can spend my happy hours on the patio of the wine bar enjoying my favorite pinot grigio and possibly some flat bread and sweet potato fries. I will bring all my friends and we will sit for hours (and be shocked when our bill comes with 45 glasses on it). I do enjoy the wine bar in the winter but it really shines in the summer.
Sincerely,
Maura"}
{"text":"I am such a huge fan of the Wine Bar in Rocky River. I am surprised I haven't reviewed them before because they are my Go-to spot for wine, date night, girls night, special occasions and more!

The wine list is wonderful. It is ever-changing and their sommelier clearly selects the best bottles to serve. There is something for every pallet and a knowledgeable staff to help you find what that is.

I've had some great meals at the Wine Bar. One of my favorite things (which I don't think is on the menu right now) was House chips with malt vinegar aioli. Perfect potatoes with bacon, bleu cheese and scallions with a malt vinegar aioli dip. So amazing.

The ambiance of this restaurant is just as charming as the food, drink and service. The outdoor patio is one of the best places in Cleveland to relax with a beverage. They keep it heated on chilly nights and we've sat out there as late as November before. The restaurant is not huge, but we've never had a problem getting a table or booking the space for a party. 

My only complaint would be parking. The lot is shared with some antique shops, so you often have to park across the street. Truthfully, I'd park across town for Wine Bar.  :-)"}
{"text":"You know, I keep going back to Wine Bar and each time I leave more and more disappointed. There is something about it...I'm not sure if it's the lackluster waitstaff or the wobbly tables or something else.

I WANT to like it...It's got a cute patio and a big tree and italian lights.

But, there is one problem on my last visit from which this place will never recover.  And that problem is PUBIC HAIR.  In the food.  Seriously, folks.  Can't make this stuff up.

Not only was there *clearly* a hair on our pizza, upon alerting the waitress, she responds \"I'm sure that's not a pubic hair.\" She fetched her manager, who came over to our table and says \"I'll see what I can do\".  Not \"sorry\" or \"let me take care of this for you\".

They removed a small percentage of our bill, but we still managed to leave paying around a hundred bucks.  That's $100.  For pubic hair pizza.

I'd be embarrassed if this were my restaurant."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back in the summer to sit on the patio and enjoy a glass of wine or three!
Great selection of wine and their menu was pretty darn tasty too! 
This place is seriously hidden behind little antique shop with parking in the rear.  The spot is not only seclude but they have a gorgeous patio with beautiful sting lights that provide a nice ambience reminiscent of a little European cafe.  
Our waiter on our most recent visit was not only attentive but very helpful with helping us navigate their wine selection.  Three glasses later and we were ready to add some nibbles.  Their menu is pretty standard gastropub fare but none the less very tasty.  Their burger was fantastic especially with the tomato jam and the parmesan fries were the prefect combo of crispy outside and fluffy inside.  Their pizza's were also quite delicious as well.
Once the patio is reopened we plan to return, have a few glasses of wine, and try their cheese plate next."}
{"text":"I just found out this place has brunch! Sundays 10-3. There was no trouble getting a seat at noon without a reservation, but the place was still pretty busy. 

The menu is of decent size with many good sounding options. Of the three entries I saw, I thought the portions were pretty large as well. 

I ordered the Breakfast Flatbread. It sounded amazing. Visually it was kind of monochromatic and underwhelming, but it was large and tasted great. There was just enough maple syrup on it to give it a good smell and a hint of it in every other bite. That sweetness was balanced with a chorizo sausage gravy with bacon in it. A lot of cheese topped everything and it must have been 2-3 scrambled eggs were on the very top. 

The Bloody Mary was also good. It had just the right amount of spiciness. For a less zesty drink the Brunch Punch was good. It changes weekly according to the menu but the one I had with lavender something and lemon was good and smooth. 

The server was a bit indifferent, and the service overall a bit slow, but with good drinks and a cozy atmosphere I didn't really mind a leisurely pace to the most important meal of the week - brunch."}
{"text":"Date night is always so amazing here!!! April the bartender is so helpful when we are indecisive about what wines to try.  The food is really great and I highly recommend this place to everyone! Thank you for offering such a wonderful place for a nice date night. A real gem!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while looking for a nice glass of wine with friends and we were not disappointed! The bartender was very attentive and friendly to our needs and even all the customers were near helped contribute to the great time we were having. It was a very low-key night, but in the best way! The atmosphere of the bar is ideal for stopping with friends to enjoy a nice glass of wine (or a few)! Would definitely recommend checking it out- I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great wine selection and nice to have wine bar over on the west side of Cleveland. 

The setting is fantastic and the outdoor patio is great. Very nice setting and the food is pretty good.

the only downside is that it is a bit small and the wait can take forever to get a table."}
{"text":"This is a story about a manager doing her job and rescuing what could have been a disastrous evening and a one star review. Let me first say that I adore this wine bar. The service is exemplery, the wine list is diverse and easy to navigate, and the food is delicious. So what was the problem? Apparently the hostess was having a bad day. And that's okay. I do her job part time at the Velvet Tango Room and I know how tough it is to put on a smile when you really feel like shoving people out the door. But it's my job to do just that. Unfortunately this hostess felt the need to take out her bad day on the customers. She was curt, rude, and never even attempted to make eye contact or a smile. I felt unwanted. A nuisance to her.

So I did something I have never done before. I asked to speak to the manager. She was gracious, apologetic, and accomodating. My entire evening went from awful to fabulous. I felt like I was important as a customer and was assured that the problem would be addressed and fixed. I proceeded to have a lovely bottle of wine with my girlfriend, decided to order dinner, and stayed for coffee and desert. Otherwise I was willing to walk out the door. Well played blond manager girl, well played."}
{"text":"forgot about this little gem there for a while. I decided to make the wine bar my spot to celebrate my birthday. Once again I was delighted with a great meal. Wine was fresh as always. For as many bottles of wine they sell by the glass, i have yet to have a glass of wine that was turned!

Ive always been a fan of their cheese fondue. They just updated it and it is now a smoked gouda fondue. with croutons and sweet pots. This is prob my favorite fondue so far. melty goudness that was to over powering that made me keep wanting more. I would have finished the whole fondue if i wasnt trying to save room for my entree. 

For my entree i ordered the beef osso bucco over parmesean polenta. the dish overall was satisfying. the polenta lacked a lot of flavor, i could not taste the parmesean. This might be because im used to eating parmesean risotto and was expecting the tasted to be on that level, but it could have been done a little better.  the beef was very tender and melted in my mouth like it should, i dont want to say it was bland because it was not. However is was missing some kind of pop. I still enjoyed the dish.

Service...meh. server was not attentive. took a while to greet us. and get our drinks. only stopped back at the table to drop off the check."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have to say that every time I like it, but don't love it. The outside patio in the summer is charming. The inside in colder weather is warm and cozy.

OK so why only three stars if it is cozy and charming?  I think it comes down to the food and service. The food is good, but no good happy hour specials and service is friendly but again, just not that exceptional. 

Last night I ordered the burger, which was good, but come on what burger is worth $13 in Cleveland?  They boast about their flatbreads, which again, are good but after all it is pretty much pizza for yuppies and not sure worth the price. I think I would frequent this place more if they had better happy hour incentives."}
{"text":"LOVE me some WINE! And, now... I absolutely LOVE me some RR Wine Bar!! We planned a little holiday get together from work at WBRR this past Sunday and the experience was flawless in my opinion. Food, Drinks, service, experience .... all were amazing! Since it was my first time there, I passed the location- so if you are blind like me, there IS a big sign that says Wine Bar with an arrow- and the road takes you behind Tommy's and places you in front of the most quaint, adorable wine bar I've seen. 

Although the yelp listing says no reservations, if you have a party of 8+, they will do call ahead \"reservations\". So, I was able to pencil 15 of us in a few days before. 

We were seated in a private room, which was beyond adorable!! Super rustic feel with candles and brick and wood. A fireplace was in the corner with TV above it. My buffalo bills fanatic friend was super excited she could watch her game and still socialize with everyone! 

Wine recommendations were spot on. Everyone enjoyed what they got, and my one friend and I shared 2 bottles of the Josh Cellars Cabernet after asking the waitress which one she recommended. A plus of this bottle she recommended, it was about 1/3 of the cost of the rest of the bottles! 

Food was really good as well. I tried the drunken goat cheese, which was okay - I didn't enjoy the fact that it was sweet (because of the topping), but it was decent and everyone else loved it. For my meal, I got two apps - the risotto arancini and the Bruschetta (brie, avocado tomato, and garlic aioli)- DELISH!! I also nibbled food off of other plates and will be getting the Wino fries next time - YUMMY dill, vinegary goodness!! I also had a bite of Brick pressed Amish Chicken- it came on a bed of orzo which was phenomenal! 

The service was great, they weren't busy at all so I'm sure that had a lot to do with it, but the waitress was SO nice and attentive. I hope when I return on a busier night, I'm just as impressed by the service.

They have a LARGE, BEAUTIFUL patio and I cannot wait to frequent this place in the summer!! I don't have a dog, but my coworkers mentioned you can bring your dogs on the patio -- just a tip for you dog-owning wine lovers :) Can't wait to try their Brunch menu either!! 

ALSO- not sure if this happens every year, but they have a giving tree by the bar and there are wine bottles all over it. You can buy a bottle of wine for 15 dollars and they will donate the money to a family in need in RR :) So sweet!! Got a great bottle off that tree!"}
