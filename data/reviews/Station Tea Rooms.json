{"text":"For anyone looking for something out of the ordinary,then this place is worth a visit.The site is the station and yard at Cloughton on the old Whitby to Scarborough railway,closed by British Railways in 1965.The station building is a tearoom and B&B and the goods shed has been renovated to provide self catering accomodation.In part of the gardens is a 1962 grounded railway coach which has also been converted to provide further self catering facilities.The remainder of the gardens are given over to tables and seating for the tearoom.The station platform is largely intact,even sporting a signal at one end.We sat in the gardens which in days gone by would have been the track and passing loop.The menu is typical village tearoom fayre  sandwiches,toasties,panninis,cakes,cream teas etc.Service was prompt and the staff friendly.The food and drink was satisfactory and the prices were in line with similar businesses.If you find yourself in the area then pop in,if only for the novelty of something different."}
{"text":"If you want a treat on a nice summers day the station tea rooms is the place. Sadly there has no trains since he Beeching cuts but the station house still looks good.I did n't know what to buy a friend for her birthday and took her there for morning coffee and there was a nice selection of snacks and lovely cakes ,scones etc. We sat outside in a pretty garden. it is has its own car park but as most of the former Scarborough to Whitby railway line is a good and very popular walk this is a good stop off.I am waiting for the opportunity to for lunch as I think it will be good."}
{"text":"Have visited the Tea Rooms as well as stayed in the B&B (they also have a railway carriage and converted goods shed for self-catering). Food in the Tea Rooms is first rate and the B&B breakfasts are too. Staff very friendly and helpful. You can sit in the garden which is lovely - well away from traffic noise and fumes! Home made food at it's very best - I'll definitely go back."}
