{"text":"WoW..!!!! Getting it right brings on an all new meaning at Damiano's Pizza. I have three girls that are very picky on how they like their pizza. Not only did they listen, they got it right and boy was it good. We have gone back again and again and the food is amazing. Try the chicken wings and pizza, you wont be sorry. It's not your cookie cutter pizza place. IT'S AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed that Damianos pizza has closed! After all the reviews on Yelp about how delicious their pizzas were . I was disappointed it was closed down"}
{"text":"First time trying Damiano's for carry out and my family of 4 loved it.  I've tried other pizza places in the \"Sunrise\" area because I live over here, but this is the first time I've reviewed 1.  Just by chance I was checking out Yelp and family wanted pizza, looked up my area and saw it, gave it a chance and we are set. 1 Xlarge cheese , 1 Xlarge sausage.  Will be back again."}
