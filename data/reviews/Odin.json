{"text":"I saw photos of this space from a blogto review and checked it out when i was in the neighbourhood a few weeks ago. it is a cool looking spot. i had a latte, it was good, but not super different than other cafes I frequent.  service was pleasant, though the guy who was at the register did not have great English, and got confused when I asked if they had decaf espresso, as I didn't see the menu. I was overcharged for a latte and a separate espresso, but the other staff was quick to help with my order so it was resolved without issues.  the place had individuals spreadout across the room working on laptops, one per table, and spaced out equally on bar seating. they have two chairs next to the entrance which worked fine for me.  overall it was pleasant, but given the location and price for me, I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite coffee shops in Toronto. They serve great coffee and know what they're doing. I loved the vanilla bean latte. I would come here to study or chat with friends. Definitely would recommend studying here, as the natural lighting and comfortable seating make for a great space for concentration, especially sipping on a perfectly frothed latte. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere - ultra cool modern vibe - great tasting coffee and baked goods.  You have to be a savvy person to understand why this is such a cool spot to frequent......and well travelled.  Great job for bringing a new spin on European flavour to a growing community of enthusiast for your philosophy!"}
{"text":"The worst baristas and the worst customer service.  I go in an order 2 large brew coffees. I pay and then 30 seconds later a barista tells me that it will take 5 minutes to get me the 2 large coffees. 10 minutes later they hand me 2 large coffees that are only half full!!! When I ask them to fill them up to the top properly, they tell me they are all out of brewed coffee and can't fill them up. Ridiculous.  Plus they hire staff who don't speak English. So half the time when I order, the barista doesn't understand what I'm asking for. Not ok."}
{"text":"Cool space, great coffee, kind people behind the counter! The area is beginning to come around, Odin is an indication of what is to come!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Definitely something different from most of the coffee shops in the area. Baked goods are delicious and a step up from most. Coffee is very good, not the absolute best, but overall a wonderful spot if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Lots of time invested into this beautiful space. Don't come expecting to get your coffee \"grab and go\" style. They like to take their time with the art of pouring a latte. Also, their food/treat selection is on point. I'm sure this place is going to be packed during the Pan Am games..."}
{"text":"Pros: Cute and bright atmosphere Baked goods looked fabulous (although did not try) Good place for a quick coffee/catch up Good amount of seating and space  Solid soundtrack  Cons: Severely understaffed for a Sunday morning brunch rush. Three people working to take orders/prep coffee/make food for a lineup of 10 and over 20 sitting customers Food was not very good. Four different people had four different items and we were all underwhelmed. Breakfast sandwiches are overpriced for how little ingredients are in them. Should not shrink them further by putting in a Panini maker, looks like dehydrated food you would get in space (and tasted that way too). Potpie was fine but likely not made in-house, the Shakshuka was underwhelming and the portion was small.  This place should stick to what it does best, café treats and hot drinks or evolve their food menu/chef to reflect better ingredients and preparation. Would go back if in the Cork Town area but would not go out of my way to check this place out."}
{"text":"In love with the atmosphere! White, light wood and big windows makes it a bright clean atmosphere. Wifi isn't very fast but the music is perfect for working."}
{"text":"I love this place, great decoration and good coffee. I don't get the negative reviews though, I think it's just a honest place doing honest business. I've been here for more than 5 times and I will continue to come."}
{"text":"Great environment and good coffee. I get work done here on the regular. Staff is great too."}
{"text":"Although some may be swayed by the 'interesting' architectural choices and ultra-modern design, I was overall not impressed with this spot. The coffee was expensive (almost two dollars more than other cafés in the area) even though the portion was small and the espresso was just decent, and the space itself was cold and uncomfortable. Even the espresso machines built into the counter, while they looked pretty cool, seemed over the top and the barista himself told me they're just more difficult to clean and maintain. Although some of the nouveau riche types (which I suppose is their demographic considering the new condos across the street) may find this appealing, I'm not interested in paying for all the overly designed space and overly high tech equipment, especially when the product is mediocre.  That being said, the service was pretty nice and the baristas were welcoming, but I'd rather see the same nice people working in another coffee shop where the coffee is better and the bar stools have upholstery."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop with a good vibe. It is incredibly beautiful inside and they have a lot of really neat greenery all around.  They serve a variety of really nice coffee's and delicious baked goods along with some pretty decent healthy options as well. The staff are lovely.  Happy to have this gem in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I have to say architecture is the star here ... but why such high ceilings for the prices? and I realize the servings used to be too big in Toronto at most restaurants and that is not healthy but why not have choices??? if we want something we should have the choice Corktown is soooo sadly lacking in choices  I live so close to Odin but choose not to go there until they have a decent affordable interesting menu"}
{"text":"Good espresso and clean, individual toilets with a communal sink. Love the design of this place. Nice patio too. Drink was made fast and they call it out. Lots of muscley single men with laptops."}
{"text":"Great music, great architecture, perfect for winding down after a long work day. Excellent coffee and beer. Will return over and over and over again. Cute baristas too."}
{"text":"pretty good. i LOVE the interior space and the succulents are a nice touch- great if you love having your coffee in an inspired space. not that much seating during a saturday afternoon and a lot of poeple camp out here with laptops, which took up the majority of the seating. I would probably like to see a maximum seat-time implemented so that there was more seating available for other patrons.   also they're either going cash free very soon or are already cash free."}
{"text":"It's a lot smaller than it seems in photos! It's so pretty and the people who both work and come here are suuuper nice. I got the cappuccino and the salted caramel brownie, the brownie is super chocolately. It's a really nice place to just sit here and study."}
{"text":"I would compare the experience at Odin to spending time in an Apple store, but with seats, coffee and no annoying apple sales people.  This is a cool coffee shop to hang out in.  Their signature Chai tea latte was tasty and sweet, although not a lot of Chai taste to it, still very pleasant to drink.  The decor is bright and airy as the pictures suggest."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are always friendly and polite and the interior decor is very sleek. I love the coffee and the fresh pastries. My weekend mornings always start here. Top grade."}
{"text":"Visited here as I got some gift cards from my condo for free. It is a bit overpriced. The latte was okay and the matcha flavour could not be tasted at all."}
{"text":"Coffee has been consistently average each time i visit.  Super close, so I'm definitely factoring in convenience.  For everyone raving about the design...Eh? The whole place just is unappealing in terms of comfy factor. You call it minimalist and Scandinavian-esque, I call it airport lounge chic. Agree to disagree?  Also their machines may seem cool, but they are inconvenient as can be, and one time I spent (not exaggerating) 10mins waiting while a repair guy fixed one. Just unnecessarily high tech? Again, nothing specifically wrong with the product, I'd just rather be at Tandem down the street.   Tldr: not my top neighborhood pick."}
{"text":"The is a new spot in the up and coming King East. Sadly this repeats the poor mantra of style over substance. The architecture which some may find interesting is an exercise on form over function IMO. I am talking hard edges on the counters, concrete furniture , uncomfortable seating all of this that is waiting for accident to happen. They also offer alcoholic beverages which might make them a hit when the athletes move in nearby for the Pan Am games. Ah well this might appeal for the demographics they are aiming for but sadly this gimmick is lost on moi.  The scone we tried was forgetful. Now the main reason we came here cappuccino. Here is the verdict Espresso:Weak Crema': OK Milk froth: Below Average Latte Art: OK A very average iteration of cappuccino."}
{"text":"It's not bad for a coffee shop. Coffee selection is very good. And it's not very busy during the day which is nice. I'm not sure if it's a good place to work remotely from. They always have the music turned up too hight and the seating is very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Great decor!!! I'm a big fan of their interior design. Natural, simple and modern style make you wanna stay there and kill time for a whole afternoon.  I think they use coffee beans from Pilot. Pilot Heritage is my favorite from this brand, recommend!   I really wanna try the filter coffee but still unavailable."}
{"text":"Beautiful space.  Servers a little snooty and unsmiling but they carry my favourite juice Owl and Goose so this a good stopping area for refreshments after running the DVP trail."}
{"text":"Decor - 4.5 stars at least The place is quite clean and nicely decorated. Quite modern and lots of room. I went there in the morning so it's not really packed at the time. Actually, it's quite peace and quiet.  Coffee - 4 stars I ordered a green tea latte and my other half got a latte. Both drinks are ok and not too bad! I'd say if u like coffee, this place is acceptable.   Food - 3.5 stars We also got some food for breakfast while I am here. A sandwich with chicken and a yogurt parfait. The yogurt parfait is the one that I remember the most. The yorgurt is not too sweet and with lots of granola crunchy stuff which I like. :) However, don't expect too much from the food presentation ... but it's not expensive either if u check out the menu so I am ok with it...  All in all, mainly it's a coffee shop so I don't think u will be disappointed if u come for a cup of coffee or latte ... as for food, if u r hungry, grab a byte just don't give too much expectation and u won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"\"By the door we noticed a fun use of driftwood with roped glass airplants suspended randomly. Overall, we found plenty of fun artistic angles thought.\" \"This is an open-concept cafe where one orders at the bar looking at their folded menus, which includes plenty of sandwich, wrap and empanada options.\" \"It is probably even better to visit as a lounge - there are beers on tap and plenty of harder stuff to choose from.\" Just a few bites from our full review.."}
{"text":"Really solid 3.5 star experience here.  This coffee shop just west of the the Don Valley River dazzles with their bold Nordic architectural designs and large space. The exposed ceiling, artwork, and sensible choices for furniture.  The food and drinks are done on par with what you would expect elsewhere but the design of Odin is what set it apart from their neighbourhood rivals.  Although I don't like to work in coffee shops or cafes, this could be a place that provides that productive or inspirational setting one needs to get things done.  Sunday service seems to be very casual and slow-paced which is okay. I ended up having to wipe down our table from all the crumbs and splatter from the previous customers but that wasn't an issue for me. Rather just do it myself then try to stretch the staff too much for a Sunday.  They are a full service cafe with food, coffee, tea, and that oft-sought after mid-day libation. They have a few options on draft and some more canned options.  I shared a turkey chorizo egg-wrap with my YEA as I had yet to have lunch and I would give it a thumbs up. Pressed in a panini press, it was an agreeable choice for the both of us. Tasted as advertised with no complaints.  We tried an almond croissant and cheddar & chive scone to go with our chai and jasmine teas. We sat back and admired the design of the cafe whilst having a conversation over our teas.  Ended up spending a full hour and half at Odin enjoying ourselves on a Sunday. That was just fine by us."}
{"text":"Nice place to go but not much seating every time I've been it's been packed so I've only ever stayed once. Cute area and decor if you want a nice insta pic"}
{"text":"Not even going to lie, I came here just for the insta-opp.   Aside from the amazing Scandinavian-inspired design of the interior which I came here for, I was very impressed by the personable staff and great lattes.   I also ordered the green juice the empanada. The juice was definite not worth the price (~ $7 I believe for a tiny bottle), and the empanada was a miss. It was one of those ready to bake things I can probably buy at the supermarket, and not worth the ~ $4 each given the small size.   Overall verdict: Great coffee, service, and atmosphere. Food was a miss."}
{"text":"Highly modern coffee place in a new neighbourhood. Beautiful, clean, modern interior, staff is very friendly, coffee is good. They also have an outdoor patio, really nice and modern. Nice place to hang out if you visit the area."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the negative reviews for this place. Odin is super ambitious - they're an espresso bar, brunch, lunch, and drink spot. So far I've been here three times to work and I'm in love. It is the perfect coffee shop to work from. They have plugs, lots of seats, good music, and most people who come here are working away quietly. Plus the architecture in here is insane. It's gorgeous with natural light pouring in all over the place.  I bought one of their healthy cookies, made of fruits, veggies and nuts and it was awesome. Boyfriend had a cheddar scone and loved it. They serve Pilot coffee and prepare it well. I've had two flat whites and an americano. All really good."}
{"text":"Sleek modern decor, nice staff but the guys that own the place are not very personable. Been there a number of times and they act as though the customers are just walking wallets and not people. It's a little too chain like in it's feel for me. Like a fancy Starbucks. No soul. Check out Tandem coffee which is not far and the owners are super super sweet and make better coffee."}
{"text":"Bad hard seats! Shared table? (why are all the coffee shops in Toronto  the exact copy of each other, I don't want to sit at a big shared table, slash study hall) I want a comfy seat for my expensive beverage lol! Sat at the only free seat, (shared table) for a person to sit directly opposite me, and shout into her laptop (Skype)... over priced, mediocre coffee! This place - Not for me"}
{"text":"It is an ambitious cafe but the architecture IS the star at this place. They are very smart with marketing and selling themselves on social media but the quality of the drinks or the food is not too different. It's simply a hipster cafe that is well designed and executed."}
{"text":"Beautifully designed cafe in Corktown. This Nordic inspired space also serves wine and beers in the evening! The service was subpar as the owners don't seem to really care about their customers - but the place is beautiful, so it's a little bit bitter sweet"}
{"text":"Delicious espresso,  very tasty,  not burnt or bitter. Excellent service,  our barista was very knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"I went to Odin to check out the Scandinavian vibe after living in Norway briefly.  The staff was friendly, but food/drink was kind of just like any other cafe (and pricey). I had a skinny latte (pretty standard) and Egg/kale breakfast sandwich which was served on an English Muffin (no sides, just straight up sandwich). I'm surprised there aren't more open-faced / seafood options given the Scandinavian inspiration.   A neat space - there are games and plenty of reading material; it'd be a good area to post-up for the afternoon & work. Very airy & open, with lots of clean lines.   I'd go back for an afternoon of work and/or to try drinks. Otherwise, it was just A-OK."}
{"text":"I keep seeing pictures of this place (eg. local publications of hot new neighbourbood places; Instagram; etc.). I had no bloody clue it was literally right across the bridge from my own neighbourhood! So close, all I had to do is brave the short walk to the wrong side of the Don River, and boom there it is, tucked in a condo building right about where King East ends.  Feeding into the instant up and coming-ness of the area, much of Odin's attraction is the obtuse ultramodern angular interior, that'll excite design nerds and Instagramming hip creatives (and remind me of plywood design projects we would do back in university). Sure is a grand welcomed change from the plethora of hipster cafes in the city that are cliche-heavy in reclaimed wood, exposed brick and vintage decor. But as cool, clean and well-lit as the place looks, form seems to precede function: the formed concrete tables and bars are not the most practical surface to work on, and feels more appropriate for a prison than a cafe. Also to note are the uncomfortable skeletal bar chairs (makes me want to start a prison cafeteria riot after an hour of bearing my painful arse). And confusing array of wifi networks. They do have a small patio though.  Odin is one of those seems-to-be-trending-in-town ambiguous cafes+bar concepts where alcohol is also served--not a lot, though they do have a couple of indie brews on tap, and open late later in the calendar week. They make much of the grub served, and decent coffee. Not big on tea however. Absolutely friendly staff though; it hardly felt pretentious or stuffy beyond the painful aesthetics of the place. It's never crowded whenever I go in or pass by it; a general mix of target-market young professionals tapping away on laptops (which seems to be more the vibe here), chillin' locals and the like to be found inside.  {TTC: 504 to River Street. If you find yourself on a Queen streetcar, that'll also work.]"}
{"text":"Beautifully designed interior and excellent coffee. I'd come here again just for the decor of this place! They sell Pilot beans here which was a plus - saved me a trip to the actual store. It's a great place to work or hangout for a long period of time. The bar stools are a bit uncomfy though. The place felt quiet enough even though it was packed when I went."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere for studying and getting work done. It looked more spacious in pictures but it also wasn't really packed. However, that is likely because it is a weekday that I came here. The interior is minimalistic in design, so it lends to the modern look, which I really enjoy. The coffee is great and so is the food, but, all the foods I have ordered were all reheated so they are pre-prepared from my one-time experience. I say this because I was under the impression it was freshly made, but I guess that was silly of me? Anyway, I would definitely come back and suggest this place for studying or just grabbing coffee with friends to chat but not to eat."}
{"text":"I find Odin to be very aesthetically pleasing and gramworthy. You can tell they've put much effort in designing the space and I just wish it was a bit closer to Yonge St. so I can visit more often. I enjoyed their iced latte, which wasn't too heavy or too light. If there is one thing they could improve on (or two), it'd be their carrot cake and more seating's. I recommend Odin for those looking to catch up over coffee in awesome ambiance or simply study!"}
{"text":"Cool interior space! Very modern and spacious, with a comfortable feel too.  I had an americano which was brewed well, with a nice aromatic flavor. I had the \"everything\" cookie which was decent, a bit buttery but I guess that's cookies are about.  Staff was friendly and the space was inviting making me want to return again soon. I think they have a menu of food so I want to try more next time for sure."}
{"text":"Nice space, polite staff ... my flat white... flat. Probably single espresso with too much milk. Rather go to Rooster or Dark Horse. You"}
{"text":"This cafe's got the dopest aesthetics. Drinks aren't too shabby here but I definitely love the atmosphere more."}
{"text":"Interior design is unique and nice. Friendly ambience and staff. One of the bests in Corktown!"}
{"text":"Very cute interior + impatient service.. I ordered a green tea latte for here, but was given a paper cup, so I asked if its possible to switch. The girl looked very unhappy and immediately poured it into a regular tea cup. Of course, the latte art was gone.."}
{"text":"Really like the cafe-slash-bar concept. Very Aussie. Good people behind the bar. Good draft. Great coffee."}
{"text":"Solid cafe/bar to hangout in! Design nerds - you will love this space. There is so much attention to every aspect of design from the blond wood grid-like shelves to their custom mugs to the modern stainless steel water pitcher to the bathrooms. While there is not a ton of seating, there is a good variety (little stool for being social or reading a book, regular tables to sit with your computer, or bar stools for whatever (not the most comfortable option, be warned). I really enjoyed sitting here and reading -- the vibe is relaxed and they play nice acoustic music. They have lots of reading material and even a small area of items for sales (resuable mugs, Wallpaper city guides, toques, t-shirts).   I had tried their chai tea latte, which was pretty standard. I have also tried one of their cold-pressed juices that had carrots and oranges - very sweet and refreshing. They have a small selection of food items -- cookies, empanadas, brownies, and grad and go salads. If you come at night, they have some bar snacks but I have only been here in the daytime.   Staff are really friendly. Zero attitude. When I have been there it's been a mix of laptop-toting students, families with young kids, people there on some sort of meeting... basically anyone can feel at home here."}
{"text":"Odin is truly one of a kind. I have yet to find a cafe that covers all bases. It's great for a great coffee, brunch, lazy afternoons & a chill night out.  5 stars for the coffee. From their lattes to cortado's, they are always good. They also make a mean matcha latte.   5 stars for the food. Odin has the usual cookies, brownies & cakes. They also have amazing empanadas, breakfast dishes (pancakes, shakshuka), paninis & other delicious pairings. They also carry ready-made salads, juice & chocolate.   5 stars for their liquor & beer options. Not only is Odin open early, but also late on Friday's & Saturday's. It's a great spot to grab a drink & have a chill night.  5 starts for the friendly staff. They are always super friendly & attentive to their customers.    Lastly, (& most obviously) the decor. The Scandinavian design is absolutely beautiful. The layout allows for lots of workspace, plus communal seating. I absolutely love the Magis stools, which are way more comfortable then they look. The only downside is that it does get packed with the usual laptop club. Luckily the weather is starting to warm up again, because Odin also has a fantastic patio.  If you haven't already been, go now!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop with an even cooler vibe.  I love the brightness that Odin has. Lots of Windows, light, white furniture accidents with cementish table tops. The chairs somehow mimic the logo in a cool way.  The staff was friendly. I was surprised that this place wasn't more busy.  I had their original Corktown burrito. At first I was nervous because I thought the food would be frozen (read: store bought). I was completely wrong. The homemade burrito was pressed for me and was delicious. I could have done without the corn, but loved the spice from the chorizo.  I also had a Caramel latte (cold). The cup was small, but the taste was light and refreshing. It wasn't overly Caramel. Some may like that overly surgery sweetness, but honestly what they gave you is all you need.  They offer other little knick knacks to buy like t shirts, coffee cups, and more.  They also sell ice cream sandwiches and beer/wine. What don't they sell?  Had I had more time in Toronto I definitely would have spent more time at Odin."}
{"text":"Discovered Odin when I first started a new job in the area and I've never been disappointed. I mean, the coffee probably comes from Valhalla so.........  The cafe is beautifully decorated and well lit, and it's a nice working environment as evidenced by the people who seem to always be there working away/studying. The place definitely has that cool cafe vibe. Interesting note is that Odin also serves alcoholic beverages (although I've yet to order them myself).  I've generally ordered only either Americano's or Latte's from Odin during my visits but both options have never let me down. The latte's do tend to be a bit on the cooler side at times so I just have to ask for the milk to be steamed a bit hotter as it gets cold quickly on my walk. Odin also carries a few food options available. I've had one of their empanadas (I believe the beef) and although it was a bit on the pricey side for the size of the empanada, it was a nice breakfast option aside from the usual bagels and sandwiches of other coffee shops.  Will continue to be back for sure!"}
{"text":"A cool new place that just opened up on King east. They serve Pilot coffee and make all types. They also have tasty treats from cookies to Empanadas. It is naturally well lit as it is a corner unit and has a very cool urban feel. They are waiting for their liquor license and will then open at night time as a drinks bar. In the summer they will open up a cool patio where you can enjoy all their tasty drinks. I look forward to frequenting this cool new spot in this up and coming neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try the cafes in this over overcaffeinated little section of Toronto and Odin is my first venture into this area. Atmosphere: Very airy and spacious. There is a lot of light because of the large windows and high ceilings. The seating a combination of bar height seating, bench seating and normal tables.  Food: Coffee was good as I would expect, we tried a couple of the snacks. They have some unique concoctions on the food side and they all turned out to be pretty good.  Washroom: Different concept here. It felt like you were entering a dressing room. The washroom stalls are in the back against the wall, with the common sink just in front of them. A wall blocks the view of the washroom from the rest of the cafe. Smart concept as it saves on space and has more stalls then your typical establishment of this size. In conclusion, if you are in the neighbourhood you should should check it out. Parents: No high chairs"}
{"text":"I really dig the interior. Its got a very modern, Scandinavian, feel to it. This is definitely a place to go if you do not want to deal with crowded, loud cafes. From my experience it has always been quiet, airy and atmospheric here. There is always a place to sit, and of course the coffee is delicious. The tea's are nothing special in my opinion but the option is there in case you prefer it over coffee. I really like the peace and quiet you get when visiting Odin"}
{"text":"Coffee was okay but not mind-blowing given the many options in Toronto. I had an americano.   Decor and vibe was nice and conducive to a couple hours of work. Would maybe visit again if I'm in the area but definitely wouldn't go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Overpriced but tasty. It's a beautiful spot and a great place to come to study or do some work. Well designed and friendly staff, however I can't justify the cost of the food. Drinks are reasonable but breakfast for two, takeout, cost $17.27 for a very basic meal, equivalent to a Tim Hortons breakfast sandwich in size, however better flavors."}
{"text":"Odin is located on King St. E. close by the Distillery District and Canary District. Dropped by on a Monday morning after running errands around the area. It was not busy and I ordered an Avocado toast and Americano. The many windows of the cafe allow for natural light to fill the entire place up. The decor has a Nordic theme to it and is reflected in the white furniture and wooden accents of the place. Service was friendly and the vibe of the cafe was relaxing. Will definitely stop by if I am around the area again!"}
{"text":"been waiting, and waiting, and WAITING to try this place out, yesterday I finally had the chance!  I was at my limit for coffee for the day, so I figured I would come in to see what option I had, i was a bit taken back by the décor of the café, it was so simple, but it felt absolutely powerful to be standing inside this café, i know it sounds super weird to say that but, i literally felt the power of Odin running through me. i grabbed a menu and checked out my options, settled on a cup of berry tea, this tea was super hot when it came into my hands, and i had nothing but time to kill so i went and grabbed a seat and took the whole atmosphere of the café in. the bathroom situation is a bit odd, its 4 separate stalls shared by a communal hand washing station with faucets that have a single handle really close to the ledge of the wall vanity. when i was able to drink my hot tea, all I could think of was DAMN this is a Damn good cup of tea.  i was boosted by this fact for the rest of the day, all i could think about was how good my cup of tea was. the place is spotless, extremely well lit, and the staff are super friendly. very very good transit options, and some street parking.  i cant wait to be in this neighborhood to be reunited with my powerful tea.  AND a nice little fun fact at the end of the review, the tea bag was not a traditional tea-bag, it was one of those hand made bags complete with a knot at the top.  very very happy and i cant waiiiiiiiiiit to go back :)"}
