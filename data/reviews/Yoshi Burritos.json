{"text":"With so many sushi burrito spots around this one doesn't really stand out. My burrito was really lacking flavor. And my friends poke bowl was lacking sides. You could add on more but for the price I  feel that adding some seaweed salad or veggies shouldn't cost extra. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just okay. Large portions compared to some of the other, tastier, sushi burrito spots in town, but have an over abundance of cheap fillers like imitation crab and lack flavor. Very friendly staff and overall enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! it's like all my favorite sushi and poke ingredients in one bowl. Friendly and helpful staff. Go here now!"}
{"text":"Tried Yoshi Burrito for the first time today. The flavor was definitely a 5/5 but the I found the burritos to be a bit small for the price. Between the helpful staff and delicious food, I'll be back. The Mexican street corn was too notch as well!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The fish taste so so fresh, (I am very picky when it comes to sushi)  and there are so many tasty options! I chose to build my own sushi burrito,the employee was very nice, she recommended a good sauce to pair with it,  and the dining area was very clean. Sooo , great food, great customer service, and super clean, Definitely going to be my new go to spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"So yummy. Really fresh fish and the nicest staff. I got the bowl and they let me taste sauces before I made a decision. 
The brown rice was perfectly cooked. My husband got the sushi burrito. He loves it too."}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna bowl was awesome!! Service was great and the place is spotless! This is so important when serving fish! I crave YoshI burrito, can't wait to try more!!"}
{"text":"The miso soup is amazing! Staff is awesome and friendly. Lourdes was very nice! highly recommend"}
{"text":"Been to a few of these places. But Yoshi burrito stands out. The employees are smiling ready to answer any questions. Very friendly. The portion is huge. Either bowl or roll. Each time I come here ( 7 times since November) the food is always fresh. Please keep up the good work. Also owner/manger Harland walks around to see how our meal is"}
{"text":"Sorry Yoshi burrito but I Was very disappointed. I Tried this place cause it was close to my house. The sushi burrito was awful but the sushi bowl was ok. Go the extra miles and go to soho or Jaburrito."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, great quality food. Nice selections of veggies and topping for bowls. The place was clean, plenty of seating and nice and air conditioned. 

We ordered two build your own bowls with ahi tuna poke and the poke was great, loved the selection of sauces, and the portions were very filling. I couldn't finish the bowl if I wanted to.

We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Quality and tasty sushi ingredients in a burrito? HECK Yeah!!! This is magic in the forest right here. Tasted very fresh. This will become a regular stop for me. I made a promise to myself to stop eating out so much. That just went out the window. Thanks guys. Both food and service is top notch."}
{"text":"Yoshi Burito is my favorite sushi burrito/bowl place. The staff are super friendly and accomodating and the sushi is super fresh. Portions are very generous as well!"}
{"text":"I had a Yoshi Burrito with Ahi Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail which was amazing!  Plus, the Poke Salad topped it all! I highly recommend this spot for fresh tasting fish."}
{"text":"Awesome light , filling , dynamically flavored sushi rolls, with a young vibrant and engaging staff of cool young buck working !  Definitely recommend having come from out of town!"}
{"text":"Got the yellowtail poke bowl. Sooooooooo good! I'll definitely come back for more and more!"}
{"text":"Favorite new sushi burrito place. Wonderful food, great friendly staff! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The bowls are good. I enjoyed the corn very much and just needed a little more sauce in the sushi bowl. Prices are pretty decent and service is really good. Would return and try other items from the menu."}
{"text":"With sushi burrito places popping up left and right, this place stands out by mixing the meat with the sauce before adding it to the bowl! And they're friendly, offering free sides of sauces on the side and making recommendations. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Love the presentation of the bowl unlike soho sushi.  Needs to have more choices and have better tasting rice.  Not a fan of their spicy tuna because of the cut of it."}
{"text":"My boys and I come here all the time. The fish is fresh and portions are generous. The restaurant is super clean and prices are great. The staff is always friendly and they remember us every time we come in. My favorite is the Yoshi burrito with seaweed paper. They always accommodate my son who doesn't eat fish. He creates his own roll. I recommend Yoshi Burrito to everyone. I eat sushi all the time and they are the best!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They are conveniently located in the same shopping center as Target on Grand Canyon and flamingo. I ordered the ronin it was fantastic. The staff including the owners were friendly and fast. Priced very well too. Lastly for those who need a healthy protein packed meal after working out at LVAC this is the place."}
{"text":"Very friendly guys, hopefully open soon in DtLV! Food was great! Yoshi roll hits the spot. Will definitely try each signature roll when their rewards program rolls out. Door was kind of confusing at night, there's no signs on it but it's like stepping into a different world. Inside looks clean but it feels like there's decorations missing. I don't feel like they are doing something different than Jaburrito or Soho but I'm glad I don't have to go too far for one. Awesome job guys!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, big portions, and lots of ingredients in the poke bowls and burritos. Best poke bowl I've had. Perfect way to refuel after climbing red rocks or hiking."}
{"text":"Beef,chicken bowl and katana roll!!! 
Food looks and taste bomb!!!
The staff are amazing always smiling!!
Take bowls home for later..."}
{"text":"I love this place! I get a byo rice bowl and add veggies and tofu! They have a great and flavorful selection for people who don't eat fish (me). My bowl is reasonably priced at around $6.50. The staff is extremely friendly and I am satisfied every time I leave. They close at 10 pm which is pretty late compared to most places! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good sushi bowls and burritos at a great location.  Place is large and the service was good.  Try the street corn!"}
{"text":"First, let me just say, the workers were super friendly and wonderful.  They also have a digital punch card/cash back system which is cool.  We ordered a couple of sushi burritos off the menu and unfortunately, they didn't have as much flavor as I liked.  Ingredients were nice and tasted fresh but the sauces used were pretty bland.  It was worth a try but I'll stick with Soho Sushi Burrito.  I was really hoping for a home run here.  I may come back and try again sometime."}
{"text":"Got the white rice with double salmon, avocado, mango, masago and tempura crunchies and it was perfect. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"My husband has been wanting a sushi burrito restaurant to open closer to where we live. Great food and customer service! We will back for sure."}
{"text":"So yummy and the staff is very friendly. Place looks clean and food is wonderful. Hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"What I had was yummy so far!  I can't wait to try more :) I'm just glad it's conveniently close to work."}
{"text":"Staffs are nice. Food is great, price is reasonable. Place is clean and you can tell that it is well maintained for sanitation."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! New spot, great location and the experience was overall fantastic.  First time here and I really liked the food and service.  With the latest surge in sushi burrito and poke places, it Can be tricky finding authentic tastes , so I was very happy with the trip to Yoshi.  Nothing over the top relative pricing and tons of fish packed into a delicious, tightly rolled seaweed paper burrito!  

They accommodated my request to change the sauce on one of their specialty burritos , the Yoshi, without any hesitation and helped us all through the menu options .  The Yoshi was packed with 3 different types of fish, fresh jalepeno, rice and a few crunch wontons and I added Siracha and sweet chili .... so good ! 

The service was attentive and nice and even checked on us while eating.  I was impressed and left with a very full belly.  

The only thing that bummed me out was the lack of taro chips! I love them so much and it's such a treat to enjoy them in Vegas so I was hoping they would offer, but they don't carry them . Sad face..... but I surely wouldn't let this stop be from coming back !"}
{"text":"I love all the new and upcoming sushi burrito joints this one has got to be my favorite! Great food great variety great prices!"}
{"text":"Good stuff!  Awesome concept.  Can't wait to get another bowl!  There is something for everyone.  It's like Chipotle meets good sushi!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been here it never disappoints. I usually get the build your own bowl and they give you such big bowls that I can never really finish it. But their fish is fresh, their bowl and burrito are tasty. I keep coming back whenever I crave for a burrito bowl."}
{"text":"First of all I just want to say that this dissatisfied review is in no way the responsibility of the very friendly and accommodating staff. They are what kept me coming back.

Since I have been going here, the experience has steadily declined. First they had a generous rewards program but I guess decided it was giving too much away so they changed it. 

But, more importantly, the food. Each time I have gone they seem to be giving me progressively less fish and sides until today I felt like I got a mound of white rice with a pinch of each fish and 1 bite of eel, and a pinch of seaweed salad.  Each scoop of protein is like almost 3 dollars? For whatever reason today my volcano bowl came with a ton of jalapenos and some spicy powder but none of the creamy mayo that seems to balance out the heat... so my face is on fire and I'm not feeling satisfied by this meal, leaving a huge pile of unfinished white rice which took up most of the container. Perhaps I should have asked for more and offered to pay if I needed to? Maybe I should have asked for the more generous chef to prepare my food? 

As an avid weight lifter, I used to come here after a workout and still be unable to finish the meal no matter how hard I tried. What happened? As much as I love this kind of food I can't justify paying $14 dollars for that again because I'm not a small child, no disrespect."}
{"text":"I have never had poke before in my life. Then I decided to check it out since in love raw fish. I tried it the first time and got it delieved from Uber Eats and OMG..It was amazing! I tried their aloha bowl 2 times already. The third time I created my own bowl with all the aloha ingredients but added extra fish and a side of seaweed salad. I can say I am now addicted. Please don't stop making delicious food. You guys are the best. I am going to order it again tonight."}
{"text":"Rise and fall of Yoshi's Burritos
I was excited when they first opened up since it's close by my house. After tonight's visit it will be my last time coming here. I ordered the Yoshi burrito and I had to keep reminding them what I wanted to add in and to replace a sauce. Even though they wrote it down that didn't matter considering they messed it up twice. Service has gone downhill which is sad since they just opened up. Oh well time to find a new spot to get my sushi burrito cravings"}
{"text":"So fresh, love the build your Bowl. Awesome prices. Bowls sizes are a good portion. Great customer service! I could get addicted:)"}
{"text":"Awesome place to try something other then the typical burger or pizza. Plenty of stuff to try from their menu. Friendly staff, great vibe and amazing food. I come here at least once a week to get my fix! Do yourself the favor and stop in if you're on the southwest side of town."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and it's STILL good! Been to other places w a similar set up but they don't give generous scoops of your protein choice like this place. Great healthy options! Miso soup is really thick tho, which I've never experienced before. I was a little worried that one of the employees hair was gunna touch my food.. she has super long black hair in braided pigtails.. thankfully it didn't."}
{"text":"Went to a few places in town to eat sushi bowls, Yoshi burrito is by far the best place I've been too. Great place to go eat, personal favorite Godzilla bowl! Staff is friendly, clean, professional. Dining area is also kept very neat."}
{"text":"Great customer service, but very below average burritos compared to other places. Even the miso soup was bad and miso soup is hard to mess up."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the staff is super friendly! I had the Spicy Tuna Poke bowl and flavors mixed together so well. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm absolutely stunned. The service was amazing & the food is too. I got the Salmon Poke bowl and loved it, I just forgot to say no wasabi. I also got Mexican street corn (not cob style) and caramel filled churros. 

I love that this place has variety & how close it is to my house. They also offer some type of rewards program that is free to sign up, you just give them your number and name. I got $1 just for signing up! If I'm not mistaken it's $.50 every time you come in but I'd confirm it with them. You can choose to save that amount you get and let the amount grow or you can use it on your order. If you save up enough, you can get a free poke bowl (or another offering) 

I didn't get the ladies name that helped me but Julian was super kind and really helpful! 

I def will be back next time!"}
{"text":"I am an old school sushi fan.  I was raised by a Japanese stepmother since the age of 10 back n in '75 and when we moved to Hawaii when I was 12 she started working at a popular Japanese restaurant in Waikiki so I was a young inductee.  Nothing I have had from Yoshi has been anything but great - especially the tuna.  I have been to others similar and they have prepackaged shoyu and wasabi and they were skimpy on giving them out.  Yoshi's has a condiment bar making the experience far better and more like the Roberto's delivery that it's designed around.."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for awhile and certainly glad I did! Upon entering the establishment, you are greeted with friendly and helpful staff, who are very knowledgeable about their products they offer.  They offer a wide variety on their menu. Everything from sushi burritos, poke bowls, byo bowls, Mexican street corn, even churros. I'm one who absolutely loooooooves salmon and if you can serve me a fresh bite, you've got a customer for life. So I ordered the Salmon Poke Bowl (salmon, green onion, seaweed salad, red onion, edamame, masago, avocado, cucumber, sesame seeds, & wonton strips) on rice for $9.95. Everything was fresh, their seaweed salad is to die for & the salmon was on point! The blend of all the ingredients, coupled with their Yoshi Poke sauce (wasabi yuzu sauce with a hint of citrus) made this a winning combination.  I wasn't to keen on the rice, little to moist for my taste, but all in all, I'd give the poke bowl 3 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"On the quest to find a reliable spot for poke bowls/ sushi burritos, I was very excited to try out Yoshi Burritos. Conveniently located near Target and Cinnaholic, it's in a great spot for em to drop by while running errands.

Ordered: Buddha Roll (ahi tuna, masago, seaweed salad, cucumber, jalapeno, guacamole, red onion, lettuce, wonton strips,yoshi poke & yum yum sauce) $8.95 and a side of Mexican street corn $1.55.

Taste: Buddha roll had a nice balance of flavors, but wasn't the best I've ever had. Portion of fish was greater than the toppings, so definitely felt worth while price wise. I had asked for them to not include the jalapenos, however as I was eating the burrito I noticed that there were several pieces of jalapeno included (I should have been more attentive when they were making my food, but I got distracted by the other menu listings).Size of the burrito was more on the long/skinny side, but I felt satisfied after eating. The Mexican street corn was just ok. It did not provide the flavors I was expecting (missing the acidity) and portion size was smaller than I would have preferred for a side. 

My quest for poke bowls/ sushi burritos continues..but I will consider trying Yoshi Burritos again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is aweseome!!! Food was great for a great price and the service was amazing. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"5m from home and just 2m from lvac flamingo. Their ingredients are fresh, quick service. You can substitute the ingredients if you don't want ( onion, tomato etc)!
They can do bowl for you if you don't want wrap.
I love their food and since it's close to my house i come here almost 3-4 times a week."}
{"text":"My first thought when I walked in was that it was very similar to Soho- same minimal style, same red-black-white decor scheme, same salsa bar items, even a similar little mascot dude pictured on the wall. The location itself was clean, and the staff were friendly.

Ordered a bowl and a burrito to split with m guy- the $6 Ronin burrito isn't a bad deal for the large portion and the flavors worked well together. Their featured bowls are a small list with only one protein each, which I found odd. The salmon bowl was unimpressive, with a huge portion of hot(!) rice and an overwhelming wasabi flavor that wasn't in the description.

 Seems the staff mixed up the sauces for our items, but since we ordered takeout I couldn't address it with them. I found it interesting that the menu has quesadillas and elote, but haven't tried either yet. I'll likely try this place again after a nearby workout, but Yoshi has a few kinks to workout and some improvements to make to stand out from the many other options around."}
{"text":"good burrito. ordering on the phone waa easy. guys at the counter were nice when I went in to pay.  restaurant is pretty inside."}
{"text":"I tried the Samurai burrito. I did not like it. The seaweed they wrap the burrito in gave me a severe headache. While I was eating, an employee had the audacity to mop the floor while I was the only customer there eating on a Friday night. I had to eat my meal and smell the strong powerful scent of ammonia and mop water.I wasted $11.85 on a terrible meal. I won't be coming back here.There are many options out there.Nobody asked me how my meal was.A complete waste of my time and hard earned money."}
{"text":"I ended up seeing this spot while running errands and had to stop and try it! I got the poke bowl with pretty much everything on it hehehe. The girls were super sweet and helpful since it's been awhile that I've ordered a poke bowl. I would say definitely try it out! Only giving it a 4 though because they didn't have the variety of mixings that I'm use to. Hopefully that will change as they get bigger. But still a must try! I ate every bite!"}
{"text":"I came in & personalized my own bowl, one of the best I've had!! All the ingredients were fresh and sauces were really good too. I liked the atmosphere & the staff was friendly as well, making it an overall great experience, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really hate to write a bad review but my husband and I had lunch here last Sunday and two days later we are still both feeling sick from what we ate. I don't know if the fish that they serve is not kept properly or up to standards but we have never felt this horrible after eating poke before. And we have pretty strong stomachs. You'd think after 24 hours it would pass but this is bad."}
{"text":"Love those burritos places popping everywhere now. This one is I think just a bit more expensive but the poke was excellent. They mixed the fish separately with the sauces before adding it to the bowl. Really good!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit and probably last for a while. I ordered Ninja roll w/seaweed paper plus a side order of miso soup (which you get it for free by checking in on Yelp). The roll itself tasted good for the most part, but it fell apart as I ate along. I think this is because the roll was not made tight enough or there was too much stuff and the seaweed paper wasn't big enough, so I ended up with a mass at the end. Now I will suggest you not to waste your money on the miso soup. The soup is so diluted that you can't tell the flavor at all other than there were some pieces of green onions and tofu in it. I make miso soup at home occasionally, so I do know how it's supposed to be and this soup here is no where near it I have to say. You would be better off spending your money on a bottle of water. However the young people that work behind the counter are very courteous and offer good service."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. I found it decently priced for seafood and very tasty. I got the Katana roll, yum. The staff was very helpful and kind. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I like making my own plate customized for me! The employees were very patient with our questions and put a lot of the options (like the sauces) on the side so we can experiment with the flavors. I have to give the young lady Kat a special thank you for being extra nice and accommodating. I personally love the bowls and suggest them over the burrito. My wife disagrees and prefers the wrap style food."}
{"text":"For me its important that where I am spending my food dollars, owners and employees serving understand that its not only about quality of ingredients and how it is put together(flavors) but making a real connection with your guest; that make a memorable experience. 

Thank you for the hospitality and preparing a delicious SB."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I am usually not one to try something new but I have many friends who love this place so I gave it a shot. 
I ordered the Godzilla adding Avocado. It was delicious! I will definitely be back. So fresh and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Something different, worth trying once. Value is lacking for the price you pay on most items."}
{"text":"Got the kitana and thought it was pretty good. It was huge I thought. Tried the street corn, was  actually decent"}
{"text":"Staying nearby for work and stumbled upon this thanks to a helpful Cali friend. In SoCal poke places are all over and I was concerned how could the desert compare? Well this place ROCKS! The serving sizes are inconsistent (Been here three times in a week) but, the service is EXCELLENT! I have been waited on by three different employees and all of them so friendly and helpful truly amazing must be a great place to work. I do build your own poke bowl and have bee very, very happy. Don't forget to check in and get some free miso soup! FYI also an inconsistent size..."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The fish is so fresh and the attendants are friendly. They let you sample the different sauces before you choose for your burrito. The prices are amazing! The portions are huge and I spend less than at a sushi restaurant for a smaller roll."}
{"text":"So happy to have sushi burritos on this side of town.  Our order got mixed up because of an incorrect picture of the menu posted.  We wanted Yoshi burritos but got the Ninja burritos instead. I hate crab mix so that wasn't gonna fly.  The owner was very accommodating replaced our rolls and even included 2 free edamame and mochi ice creams.  Everything tasted fresh and flavourful. The only thing I would ask for is a bit more sauce.  My 2 year old is going thru a salmon roll phase, so we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First I want to say that the people there were super friendly and helpful!!
My 11 year took a bite of my Katana Burrito and said \"It tastes like heaven\" lol! I modified the burrito a bit and left off the cucumbers, lettuce and jalapeños ... still delicious and fresh. 
The Mexican street corn is a must and the caramel filled churro was delicious. 
We checked in and got the free Miso soup! (Yay!) 
We live close and it was so good, I joined the rewards program. :)"}
{"text":"These guys have been awesome each time I go in. Every time the crew is super polite, even when a rush is happening. Out of all the sushi burrito places I've been to in Vegas, this is definitely my go to. 

The burritos also have a very generous sizing when it comes to portions compared to others, like Jaburritos, but it's the perfect amount for a meal. Trying a poke bowl out today; will edit once I've gotten home and given it a shot!

Edit: Aloha bowl with double Ahi and half/half white rice and greens. I have to say it was absolutely filling! I loved the little touch of spice in the sauce that added to the flavor. Only thing that was a bit off putting was the hot rice amidst the cold items. I'll probably go with full on mixed greens next time and save the rice for a burrito. =D"}
{"text":"Picked up Build your own spicy tuna rolls for the drive back to CA.  We didn't eat it right away so it was a little hard to eat in the dark.  Taste was pretty good but I think I prefer warm rice.  Maybe I should have ordered the bowl instead...  
Overall we enjoyed our rolls."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, Such a pleasure to order, they must have a great training program. 
Had a yoshi bowl, it was quite tasty and portions are big, Ingredients were all fresh and crispy. 
They also have my favorite Japanese canned coffee UCC which is a rarity. Very clean establishment worth stopping in if your in the neighborhood for sure."}
{"text":"First time here and I'll be back!  Fresh ingredients - I ordered the Buddha and it was excellent. Portion was quite large, and splitting it was enough for both."}
{"text":"Super good and fresh and you can customize it however you want which for me was key since Im on a restrictive diet.
Ive gone three times and ill go again."}
{"text":"This place gets it right. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu, and it's all great. They even get the temp of the rice right. High quality and consistent. All of the fish taste really fresh every single time, and the shrimp tempura is always delicious and crunchy.I wish the sold bottles of their sauces."}
{"text":"I've always loved Poke Bowls and I've tried a lot of them. For me, above anything the freshness of the fish has to be good in order to be called good poke. The quality of the fish at Yoshi Burritos was actually pretty good! There are also a lot of add ons, which is great! My favorite is mangos! There's not that many places that offer mangoes in their poke bowls but I was really happy they had those here. They also are very generous with their add ons, so I definitely think I was getting my money's worth. If you check in, they offer free miso soup, which was great cause it completes the whole meal. It's also a lot of food, so you can always split the bowl between two meals. The staff there were also very nice! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the Ninja sushi roll and my husband got the ahi tuna poke bowl. Both were amazing! We also got a side of Mexican street corn, and churros filled with caramel. Everything is reasonably priced and the food quality is outstanding. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There's nothing really special about this place it's just another mediocre sushi burrito place and if you get one of the non sushi burritos they are repulsive"}
{"text":"I got the salmon poke bowl. It was so delicious. The service was great.  The place is super clean. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's meh. This place has been open for a month and the staff still doesn't know the menu. They take orders on post it notes, the flow of the line is poor and there's nothing really exciting about what they offer. Try it if you want, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, especially when compared to Soho Sushi Burrito. Sad attempt at a great concept. This is the kind of place that was opened with the sole intention of making a profit. This place has no heart. No separate menu for vegans or vegetarians. Sushi rice tastes like plain white rice. Not cooked right either. Poor selection of toppings and no vegan mayo or unagi. So disappointing. Soho Sushi Burrito forever."}
{"text":"The poke is decent but the service is not that great. We were greeted by several girls when we walked in. None of them asked if we needed help with the menu and pressured us to order quickly. Our order was taken by one girl and passed along to another girl to make. They were very slow at making the actual meal. The girls working just seemed very disorganized. It took about 15 minutes to get our meal and when I asked for a sauce on the side it took an additional 10 minutes to get it. The girls try to make conversation with the customers but it gets pretty awkward because they don't have the menu memorized so it takes them longer to prepare your food. The food is fine but not for the amount of time you have to wait to eat it."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have eaten here allot since it it right across from LVAC. So it's perfect after a workout. It's quick, the food is great you can choose between wraps or bowls and the bowl have even healthier options serving over mixed greens. Their sauces are killer too. My kids love their street corn and churros."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this place has some awesome food...There's not one thing on the menu that's not good...The people that work there are friendly and always make you feel welcome...if you're looking for some awesome sushi bowls or sushi burritos...Check this place out and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is AMAZING!!! My husband and I come in once or twice a week and are extremely happy every time! The staff is so sweet, the food is fresh and the price is perfect! :)"}
{"text":"There's a lot of sushi burrito places in town, but this doesn't hold a candle to Soho or Jaburritos. The staff was friendly, and their menu offered a twist on a few out of the ordinary items. 

The floors definitely could have used a good mop though. The floor was oddly sticky in the area I was sitting. However, there was just something off with the flavor of my burrito; thus, I just couldn't bring myself to finish my burrito. There's a first time for everything, and this place is closer to me; however, it's just not completely worth it for me. The quality of the fish just didn't taste right, which I think could have been an account of the rice being a little too over cooked. I also got a fortune cookie with my meal, but it was already partially opened. There's other sushi burrito places in town, but this is definitely a last choice for me. I'll choose to travel to somewhere where I know quality is ensured in their food and establishment.


Update: I ended up getting really sick a few hours after eating here."}
{"text":"This place is so good. They don't skimp on the filing and the price is affordable.  The people are really nice and the place is clean.  I am going to be coming back often.  If your looking for a great sushi burrito place or poke I recommend you come here."}
{"text":"Loved Yoshi Burrito! I'm new to the sushi world and don't know what a lot of the stuff were. They were quick to explain and help me build the perfect burrito! Also they were super friendly and the lady even came up to me after I was finished and asked how I liked it and if there was anything else they could do. Definitely recommend! Thanks Yoshi Burrito!"}
{"text":"So this place wasn't bad, but it wasn't top notch. I think the food quality has potential, but I came at a poorly staffed time. I ordered the Ronin, it was super cheap compared to everything else. The fish tasted really fishy, like is this a little past it's prime? I checked in and got a free miss soup. It took them five minutes to bring it out and it was ice cold. It looked good though. If I go back I think I'll try something else. Also, it was super busy, but it took forever for people to get their order."}
{"text":"I come to Yoshi burritos there's nothing but face and a smile to go with it. Your crew makes it very customer oriented friendly to the point where I have to come here and eat very often the treat me like I'm family and I enjoy it"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The soft shell crab is my favorite. The owner Went out of his way just to ask us how the meal was. Great place"}
{"text":"Giving this place a 4 stars because I had ordered a yoshi burrito and it was so bland I couldn't even take the flavor of it all. 
The staff was super awesome and the manger was very helpful as well. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"WOW... this is ONE OF THE BEST in vegas!  Again, I thinking i'm getting hooked up with huge portions but only to have my ego slammed (bc i thought i was so cool they hooked it up) by them telling me these portions are NORMAL!! I really like that they have street corn as a side. They basically have most of the same menu that majority of the sushi burrito place but what stets them apart is their sauces... they're AWESOME! ....suggestion try the sesame sauce. REALLY check this place out.... I'm sure you'll like it!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited when they opened down the street from me! The amount of fish they provide in every dish is generous. Their homemade sauces have great flavors and aren't too salty or heavy. 
I never order a bowl and feel like I'm not getting what I paid for. They increased the size of their bowls since opening and I feel like they also increased the amount of protein. And if you don't feel like it's enough protein, you can order a double portion for only $1.50.
You have the option to make your own bowl, order a specialty bowl or a specialty roll. Any of these options are priced under  $10.
Make sure you join their rewards program too! And they offer LVAC members a discount."}
{"text":"I had no problem with the staff but the burrito wasn't good at all. Nothing was good about it. Not even the rice. They leave raw fish uncovered all day and it's abundantly clear the fish isn't fresh just by the look of it. Definitely wouldn't suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious! If you've never had a sushi burrito this place will make you an instant fan!  Friendly helpful staff and quick, delicious, healthy food. I'm sold!"}
{"text":"Damn it!!!! I wish I could've loved this place cuz it's close by my house but I guess I have to drive far for my burrito fix!! There portion are huge but there yum yum sauce lacks flavor so my burrito was bland I'm so sad I'm at home dipping it in soy sauce..anyways great customer service that's for sure but I won't be back sorry"}
{"text":"I have tried this place several times because it is across the street. I am an avid sushi fan and was excited for them to open near my home. I have brought lots of friends and have watched them evolve. I love eel and used to order it in my bowl. The first time it was alright but the next two times I pulled significant fish bones out of it.  I had spoken to the owner and he apologized saying that all eel is prepared that way. It's not. I have eaten eel for the last 15 years and never once have I pulled bones out of it. I let the first time slide but the second was too much. I decided that the fish was still good quality so I would just avoid the eel from now on.  Today, I decided to go back after I hadn't for several months and I ordered a bowl with salmon and spicy tuna. The quality has gone down significantly. The fish is not fresh, the salmon doesn't taste like salmon and it is so mushy that my fork disappears into it. Gross!!!! Also this potentially carries food-born illness bacteria. It also did not have one similar flavor note to what salmon tastes like. It tasted like fishy aluminum. How horrible.  As having been in food and beverage management for several years, I can safely say that I will not be going back here until they improve their quality.  They'll be lucky if I don't send a health department rep there for a surprise visit. I did not see the quality of the rest of the fish as I had someone else pick up my meal for me.  My stomach has started to turn since I quit eating the bowl. Raw foods are extremely delicate to handle and the company should absolutely not sacrifice quality for price! You can get people sick!"}
{"text":"My family came in for the first time and enjoyed it.  Their prices are reasonable, customer service was great!  The staff made us feel welcomed, answered all our questions clearly, and checked on us while we were eating.  The menu has a wide variety of options, including pick your own.  I picked a bowl with soft shell crab and toppings.  Overall, it was tasty and a good size.  The reason for 4 stars is that there was too much rice, not enough meat.  We will be going back :)."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi burrito and poke bowl place.  Always very fresh and filling."}
{"text":"I built my own sushi burrito roll :D !!!  I'm sure my excitement about this is equivalent to the little kids who built a bearrrr.  Except my sushi burrito is better!  You know why kids?  You can't eat bears.  And you can't put Yumz sauce on a bearrr... okay pungkins.  One day you'll understand.  

What'd I pick?  The seaweed paper.  It's gotta be like an actual sushi roll right - for a first timer sushi burrito trying spicy raw seafood loving hungry person who decided to skip lunch today (breeeaaathe) :/

Alright, ready... 
Proteins: Spicy tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail.  
Sauces: Wasabi aioli and Avocado cilantro (drools).  
Veggies: Cilantro, Cucumber, Red onion, Seaweed salad.  

It's about to happennnn!  Please add Masago.  Lookin' good ;)  $8.95.  That's decent.  Thanks for helping me!  I'll add tip... An hour or so later.  Well done!  I shall bring these exact ingredients list back for another.

The space and seating is a good size, not huge, mostly two seater tables.  Simple wall designs and looks clean.  The ceiling is really high.  If this place picks up crazy business, there'd be room to build second floor seating possibly.  

They sell authentic green teas.  I'm saying authentic cuz I can't decipher the characters on the bottles.  There are regular fountain drinks also.  It's self serve next to the plastic utensils and napkins.  I didn't get to ask if there are free refills.  And there are extras like jalapenos, miscellaneous spicy sauces, and pickled ginger on the side of the register - allowed to help ourselves.

Friendly and really helpful customer service.  Their countertop is short, so this place only had 3 workers handling my order.  They wear disposable gloves; important.  I'm very grateful they let me sample 3 other sauces that are not in my burrito: Yumz, Sesame, and Unagi.  Yumz is my fave and I'll add it in next time.  Cya' again Yoshi!"}
{"text":"My first time in this place. Better than what I was expecting. Pleasant surprise, got the Aloha and my wife got the Godzilla."}
{"text":"I came here with my two friends to eat and all I can say is they are extremely friendly, fast paced service and clean up incredibly. I'm coming back for sure sometime soon with how amazing they are and how delicious the food was. It was a good amount too unlike other places that seem to be stingy with the amount they add on."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see a sushi burrito spot finally open closer to my house. I'm a SoHo Sushi Burrito girl. I'm a little disappointed with Yoshi though. They were very stingy with the amount of fish they put into the burrito. Not like SoHo where they pack it in! The burrito lacked flavor, it all blended together and nothing really caught my attention. Its also slightly smaller in comparison to SoHo. Don't get me wrong, it did taste good... but the fish didn't stand out and have the flavor it should. It was pretty basic. The customer service was great. But, you could tell they just opened. He didn't really know the menu too well and had to keep double checking if he had everything correct. But, they were all professional and nice. I'll come back, but only if I'm to lazy to drive to SoHo."}
{"text":"Great Flavors and affordable ...! The healthiest fast food I know of... Try the Yoshi Burrito..! Highly recommended !!!good job"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying sushi burrito and I am hooked!!! I bought the Yoshi Burrito and it was amazingly yammi. I will definitely be going back for more. Service was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"They lack flavor! It tasted bland for the most part. I had to find where the sauce is in order to enjoy my bite. The sauce were also subtle; there was no \"omg so good\" effect to it. Regarding the fish, the salmon was okay, but the tuna didn't really tasted fresh. We went at 9pm though so that might be the reason why.
We got kimono and Yoshi rolls. Maybe, if there's a next time, we'll try their bowls and ask extra extra sauce to coat every pieces of fish.
Regarding the store, they need to care more about their tables. We had to dust of crumbs from our table. Giving the staff the extra star for explaining to us their menu since it was our first time there. Overall there are much better sushi burritos/bowls in town."}
{"text":"We love coming here. The food is good and fish is fresh. I get their build your own bowl mixed greens and spicy tuna. My daughter gets a california roll with a tempera shrimp sushi burrito. The service is good and they are friendly. Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Ahi tuna poke bowl was amazing!!! Very fresh! Customer service was excellent. Very clean restaurant which is a must for me!!! Can't wait to go back again and again and again! My new favorite spot to eat!"}
{"text":"My seaweed was soggy it took 15 minutes to get my food. It was 52 degrees we understand you have dark windows but your door was wide open and it was an unpleasant experience because I was unable to enjoy my food because I was freezing."}
{"text":"Bomb.com renewed my faith in sushi burritos at reasonable prices. Kinda weird placement in the middle of the shopping center it's in, but really righteous burrito that utilized fish as well as surimi."}
{"text":"This place is so YUM!! We had the salmon poke bowl & an unagi burrito. The fish is fresh & the sauces are superb. Also make sure to try their Mexican Corn & churro as a side. Loved the staff here too. Got to meet the owners & they have a pretty cool vision for the place. Everyone here is incredibly friendly. Will be back next time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable! Everything was fresh, made to order, and portion was generous. I appreciated the friendliness of the staff and the flexibility when I asked for a burrito to be cut for my kids to share. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have yet to find a sushi burrito spot that I don't like. The major pluses here are that I've never had to wait in a long line, parking is super easy, they have interesting things on the menu besides sushi bowls and burritos, such as street corn and desserts and unique drinks, and the staff is all super friendly every time I go. I love where they're located, too, as there are so many options for food, so if you're with a picky group you can all get what you want (I've gone for chicken teriyaki while my SO got Yoshi Burritos and we met in the middle )."}
{"text":"What a nice find! Friendly, accommodating, fun menu, so much to choose from! Loved it! Will be back for more! Wish they would be more environment friendly tho and use compostable dishes instead of regular plastic! Hope to see that change in the future!"}
{"text":"A but sloppy but hey it's a sushi burrito! Quick easy and got what ya asked for! Ordered the godzilla roll comes with a few proteins I would highly suggest this place it was the perfect size!"}
{"text":"Great service! Food came out quickly made to order fresh right in front of you. Clean restaurant and staff very friendly Awesome food try spicy tuna bowl and Mexican st corn!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of poke bowl places, but this one is my favorite! It's always clean and organized, the fish and veggies are always fresh, the staff is always friendly, and I get my bowl exactly the way I want. Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"I just received my kimono roll that I ordered through Uber eats and omg is it good!! It's honestly my first time ever eating a sushi burrito and I can't believe I waited this long. The salmon has a really fresh taste to it and it has kick to it, which was even better. Sucks I didn't get the avocado that I added when I placed the order but it's okay next time I'll just go in and maybe try something else, which I'm sure it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Our food was great and my husband said the staff was friendly when he picked up our order. I'm glad this place is so close to our home."}
{"text":"To start off the service is amazing! Everyone was nice and prepared the burritos fast. The burritos were a little over filled but that is a positive for me because that means more fish. The atmosphere was really good and the establishment was clean. 
The food, however, was disappointing. If you have ever had soho burrito you probably will not like this place. I ordered the kimono. There was plenty of salmon but even-though it tasted fresh the pieces were cut too small and tasted dry. The poco de gallo did not taste fresh at all and distorted the flavor of the burrito. It took me by surprise that they used regular rice instead of sushi rice. With each bite it was just a mouthful of bland rice with no taste. Overall the burrito was bland and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Cat was very informative ! I kinda wandered in didn't know what I wanted but knew what I didn't like and cat was able to help me out and provided awesome service , 10/10 will be back thank you !"}
{"text":"Julian gave great customer service and hooked me up with all the eel sauce I wanted! The burritos were great and loaded with meat. My only complaint is the seaweed wrap didn't cover the ends of the burrito so things were leaking out and it fell apart easily. Be careful because spicy is pretty darn spicy."}
{"text":"Yes! Thank you for coming to this side of town! I no longer have to drive all the way to jabburito. Food is just as good!"}
{"text":"Random trip to Vegas was feeling for some poke bowl since the last time I had one was when I came to sin city a year ago, it was good and generous."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a super friendly staff! We've been a few times this week and have brought family members to try it also and they all love it! We will be back soon I'm sure! The Katana is delicious even with my substitutions because I'm picky but it is sooo good!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here with the kids to eat dinner after going to Flip-In Xtreme. They are very friendly here and the kids and I loved the food. The owner put on Kung Fu Panda on the TV for the kids to watch. There was good music on in the background too. I love the concept of sushi in a bowl. I ordered the Katana in a bowl and it's AMAZING!! She even gave me extra sauce to try so I tried the Avocado and Cilantro and it was fantastic. I highly recommend this place. It's not crowded either which we liked so we could hear each other. :)"}
{"text":"I was so overwhelmed due to never experiencing a sushi burrito. The staff was super friendly and patient! I believe Gene was the gentleman who assisted me and he was very knowledgeable! He let me try a few things which guided me in the right direction and I thoroughly enjoyed my first sushi burrito!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit was a success. Clean dining area and bathroom with a helpful staff. I ordered the Yoshi Burrito and loved it. Conveniently located close to my house so I will definitely be a regular.

*They also offer UNLV student discounts. Go Rebels!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm really impressed with Yoshi Burrito! I'm in town from LA and the sushi burrito thing is huge there, so naturally I wanted to try the new spots here. Much like JA burritos on rainbow you walk down a line choosing toppings for a sushi bowl or burrito. The quality is A+ very fresh! The place is very clean and the employees are nice and helpful. I'll definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning for a quick breakfast/lunch.

The service is exceptional, although it is a fast service concept, you never feel rushed out by the staff like other places, they really take the time to listen and accommodate all your needs, I am very picky when it comes to food, but the staff did everything possible to make my food the way I wanted to. 

I will def be back, they got everything for me to return
Caring staff
Good/healthy food
Reasonable prices
Super Clean  ^_^"}
{"text":"YOSHI BURRITOS IS BOMB.COM! My regular order for me and my coworker are the miyagi w added veggies & the katana with a side of their poke sauce & wasabi. So good and always made perfectly :) Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"So good! I tried Poke about a month ago and I've been hooked ever since. Saw this was a new spot in my area and decided to give it a try. So happy I did. I ordered a Samurai seaweed wrapped burrito which was incredible. Portion sizes were massive ended up having half for dinner that night. The girls who prepared my food and rang me up were extremely friendly. Had a nice conversation about the origin of Poke with the girl who prepared my burrito. Definitely will be back in the future whenever the Poke urge strikes again"}
{"text":"I've had dinner 2 nights in a row from here! My daughter LOVES their simple chicken teriyaki bowl ( a steal for $5!) their $2 street corn is amazing! Love this little restaurant, employees are always so sweet"}
{"text":"Place is a joke. Limited add on's. Everything is an extra charge. When this place first opened they included Alot of additional toppings but now it's just upcharge everything. You lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place. There were so many great reviews that I thought, hey this could be amazing because my fellow Yelpers said so. Instead I was so disappointed and I didn't even get through half of my meal before throwing it away. My husband who normally can eat anything threw his away after eating half of it. The salmon was fishy and mushy, the rice seemed like it was made a few days ago, the tempura shrimp was ok and the imitation crab had this sweet sauce mixed in with it which I didn't like at all.  We came here after work so it was busy but they were fairly efficient when it came time to order. I am just disappointed in the outcome as I love poke, sushi, etc. I, myself would not come back knowing that there are definitely other places that will float my boat, but that's just my two cents."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to get sushi they have great customer service and they always greet me with a warm welcome the employees are really nice and energetic. And the sushi roll that I got was delicious I believe it was called the Yoshi and it's by far my favorite I'll be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"We love coming here. The staff is great and the food is good!

They have set items in the menu that you can customize and you can always build your own. My usual is the Ronin. Depending on the day, I'll get the sushi burrito or the sushi bowl add cilantro and red onions. I don't eat very much in one sitting so I will usually eat one half then save the other half the next day for lunch. 

Who knew that you could do something different with sushi and it be such a hit!"}
{"text":"Yellowtail bowl is my favorite. I'm so glad I found this place close to my house. It is a delicious lunch that is healthy too. I'm pretty sure I come here too often."}
{"text":"Ordered Yoshi for takeout and we got two yoshis, the street corn and seaweed salad. What I love about the sushi burrito was that the flavor didn't overpower the sushi, it was super subtle so that you could still taste the sushi, but it could have used just a teeny bit more sauce. The street corn was good and so was the seaweed salad, and our food came at the estimated arrival, which is also good! Definitely would try this place again"}
{"text":"Well, I was greeted by the staff . Had to wait at least 5 minutes before I could order . There was only 3 people in front of me. The fish I got didn't seem too fresh but it wasn't disgusting , besides the fact that my unagi had BONES in it !!! After all my years of getting sushi this was a first. I'm so glad I got a bowl and not a burrito , I was able to pick them all out and toss them . There goes the extra $1.50 for that. I got it to go , I don't like how they put hot rice for your sushi bowl, it made everything that is suppose to be cold warm . Not a fan"}
{"text":"Whoa! We came for dinner and the place had one other family. Majority of ordered were to go from other patrons.

Samurai roll was huge, just like a burrito.  It was very satisfying and the taste was on point.  The miso soup was just as delicious as well.

Poke bowl, came with everything and then some.  Wife loved it and was impressed of how.much they put in the bowl.

Definitely coming back and trying a different roll."}
{"text":"First time here had a yoshi burrito on flour tortilla, wow very delicious and different.I will recommend this place to everyone. The food here  is rockin the young lady was very pleasant and helpful. My burrito was a good size. I will definitely return to this great spot"}
{"text":"I have no idea why a Japanese/sushi-inspired place has Mexican street corn but I LIKE IT. Best street corn I've ever had in my life. I got the yellow tail bowl and I hate to cheat on my other poke restaurants but this is hands down the best poke bowl I've ever had. I like that they added edamame and won ton strips. Seaweed salad and won ton strips were great but if I could go back I would just order 4 sides of that corn tho!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and an even better staff. When you walk in, you're instantly greeted with smiles. They ask if you've been there before (we hadn't) then go through the menu with you. We ordered a burrito and two bowls. I had the spicy one and it was amazing!! My husband had another one and he loved it as well. My daughter inhaled the burrito without a second thought. 
I would drive out of my way to visit it again."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the burrito and bowls were very tasty. Wish they had better tasty chips like Soho Burrito does. Still well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here three Thursdays in a row and I love this place. I spend $14 for dinner, and it's delicious and filling. They don't skimp on the sauce, which I personally appreciate, and their eel sauce is freaking amazing. This is my new permanent Thursday dinner place to go to before my board game meetup group."}
{"text":"One of my favorite poke spots. They do not skip on the sauce and toppings...always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Food was great I had a build your own with soy paper, salmon, yellowtail, cucumber, avacado, seaweed salad, yoshi poke sauce, and wasabi aoli. The staff was very helpful and nice. Place isnt badly priced."}
{"text":"I love sushi. When this place opened several months ago it was a game changer. The owner is a pretty cool guy, I'm so bad with names lol. I came in tonight towards closing time ( I hate doing that ) but I was greeted by Abril & Glenda. Honestly all I got was smiles and courtesy especially towards closing time. You don't find service like this today no where.  This is why they have customer loyalty, one because your food is the bomb dot com & also your employees are wonderful. That's the difference. Glenda and Abril, I had a rough day today, and your personalities made me reset into a better mood. Thanks for the smiles, laughs, and world class customer service. You guys rock!!"}
{"text":"Felt like a Soho sushi burrito knock off. And sadly they didn't quite do it. 
The workers were slightly rude with a chip on their shoulder and the whole process was very disorganized ...they had us indicate what rice we wanted and what menu item we were ordering, and then had us pay...then go back in line against the flow to put the toppings on (which had already started to be put on without our request or knowledge, so corrections had to be made which were met with an attitude). The whole process did not flow well and if we had questions they were answered reluctantly.  The quantity of food was good but this place may need more time to get in the swing of things, get organized, train positive workers, etc.
The one star review is because I received a private message on 2/1/17 from the owner- he basically stalked and 'researched' me.  He looked up where I was from (hometown), claimed he knew my husband was in the military, he knew my husband's name, excused the male worker that was rude to us of being pregnant (what?), and claimed to know WHERE I CURRENTLY LIVE and WORK. Totally inappropriate and creepy! We definitely won't be going back here, and I've reported him to Yelp. He has claimed I'm lying however I have actual screenshots of his message to me.  Screenshots don't lie. These were forwarded to Yelp and I saved them in the event the police would need to get involved. Sadly, even though I actually liked the food, due to the clearly inappropriate behavior from the owner, I will not be returning. 
*This is a factual honest review based on my experience at the business and based on the interaction from the owner."}
{"text":"The girl working could not have been nicer. She helped my daughter and I out when we couldn't decide (very patiently!) made great recommendations, and even let me customize my roll. Everything was fresh and good. The only slight disappointment was the miso soup - lukewarm and too salty. It is a ton of food, so come hungry! I am excited to try more options from the menu. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi burrito place I have been to. The burritos taste amazing, and the service is great. The environment is pretty laid back and comfortable. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try sushi burrito for the first time."}
{"text":"Great fresh food helpful staff seaweed is great! Very clean and large menu fish and items"}
{"text":"Of all the sushi burrito and poke places I've been to...I'd say this place is by far the worst. They charge for almost every little topping like seaweed salad (which is usually a given in any poke bowl free of charge at other places). I ordered a build your own poke bowl. Added tuna and spicy tuna over a bed of brown rice. Toppings of seweed salad (extra charge), cream cheese, red onion, ice berg lettuce, edamame (also extra charge) and cucumbers. I also chose the chipotle mayo as the sauce and it just tasted weird. Not good. I ended up throwing away half of it out. 
It's so ridiculous that they charge extra for half the toppings when most other places are free toppings. Will most likely not come back."}
{"text":"Came in around 9 pm on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy but there were a couple of people ordering. Idk if anyone else thinks this but I can usually tell how my visit will be based on how they welcome me in, especially if they're closing within the hour. I felt the staff was more annoyed that we came rather than excited. 

Took a look at their menu & I didn't really like any of their signature bowls besides the salmon poke. You can make your bowl with white rice, brown rice, or mixed greens. I opted for the brown rice. The bowl came with 2 different sauces. 

There are so so many poke places opening in the vegas valley. The competition is pretty high & though yoshi burrito isn't bad, i didn't think it stood out. The fish was alright, it wasn't crazy fresh. If I'm in the neighborhood, I'll probably come back. Otherwise, it's not something I'd make the trip for."}
{"text":"My nose always leads the way. When I first stepped in, I knew this place would be good, because it did not smell fishy. I ordered a mixed greens salad bowl with Spicy tuna and yellowtail. The salad was fresh and crispy, nit wilted like most places. The fish was great too! The staff was very nice and helpful with suggestions. Thank you for an enjoyable and quick lunch."}
{"text":"I was out on a little shopping trip to IKEA with my son and he told me about this new place over by Target that specializes in Sushi Burritos.  Thought I'd give it a try as Target was my last stop of the day.  So we gave it a shot.  GLAD I DID!!!  It was YUMMY!!!  I had a Buddha Roll that was very filling.  Even though they have a set menu I was able to customize my meal to my liking.  That's a plus for me!!!  Everything including the fish was fresh and the staff was very helpful as they guided my through all the fixings.  My son had a Poke Bowl which he's had before and was not disappointed!!!  This place was very clean, well maintained and fresh.  I will definitely be back and excited to try the Poke Bowls!!"}
{"text":"SO i came here before and i ordered a bowl and i really wasnt feeling it , but this time i got the burrito and got to choose every specific topping on my sushi burrito and it was bomb. I now learned that the bowl i had last time had some kind of wasabi sauce on it that just made my bowl taste not great . I usually wouldnt come back after a bad experience but the owner was sure a second try would change my mind and it definitely did. I recommend customizing your own bowl/burrito so you know exactly what ur getting as to getting the specials that already come with the toppings. Super great service here. I now come here regularly(:"}
{"text":"GOOD
Great customer service..and willing to take the time to walk you thru the process if you've never been.  

I built mine off the standard ones that you can order by spicing it up and adding some texture to my burrito. 

They let you taste the sauces prior so u can know what you're getting into.

All the reviews of people complaining about  being mushy I don't understand....you're eating raw fish and sauces in a burrito. Of course its gonne be \"mushy\"...add some texture to it with tempura, vegetables or something people! 

BAD
The flavor and spice profiles are not as vibrant as they could be for those that like it hot and spicy =)  kudos to the friendly staff"}
{"text":"Unsanitary and staff are insufficiently trained to prepare food according to health code.

1) Server leaned halfway into the kitchen to ask for an ingredient, except instead of walking in, she grabbed onto the wall.   Without changing her gloves, she began to prepare burritos and bowls for customers.  

2) In preparing a sushi bowl, the server began to put cold refrigerated raw fish onto steaming hot bed of rice.  I mentioned to the staff that is not safe and defeats the purpose of keeping raw fish refrigerated in the first place.  Her response was this is how we have always made it here.  I asked her to put the raw tuna in a separate container and I'll simply wait for the rice to cool down.  The rice was so hot, even 30mins after leaving, the rice was still too hot to be used and i ended up eating that separately.

As for the free miso soup check in, it was more miso flavored water with 3 mini cubes of tofu.  Rather than preparing it ahead of time in proper proportions, it was made by squeezing miso out of a plastic bottle and then she walked it over to the plain hot water dispenser.  

The owners spent money on investing in the restaurant but the staff needs better training and oversight.  With all the sushi burrito joints in the valley, I am reluctant to visit Yoshi Burritos again."}
{"text":"I am a loyal customer with Yoshi. Fast and friendly service. It takes me just about 5-15m to have my food depend how busy they are. I always have Kuma bowl with grilled salmon and brown rice. Taste perfect. Their street corns are good as well. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Recently moved from LA and I am very glad I found Yoshi.  

Food : My favorite is the Volcano, always fresh and high quality ingredients 

Staff : very friendly and accommodating as well. 

Location : is very convenient too, inside is spacious and airy.

Definitely recommend this place it's fast, fresh and affordable ! Thank you Yoshi for my healthy and yummy lunch and dinner ^_^"}
{"text":"These poke places that are popping up everywhere are like Chipotle ; you create your own meal. So long as the ingredients are fresh you can't really criticize what you get. My poke bowl was good and the staff accommodating. That said, I got a free bowl of miso soup through a Yelp offer and it was the worst miso soup I have ever had. It tasted like warm tap water."}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly but a little ditzy so make sure you pay attention to what you're ordering and when they make it. It's not always the same. It's really tasty. I highly recommend the ahi tuna with mango habanero, avocado and cucumbers."}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly and patient as I asked to try most of their sauces. Compared to other poke/sushi burrito places, their prices are pretty good for their portions! I probably save a dollar or two from my three proteins compared to other places. Some places charge extra for seaweed salad (this place doesn't, which is a plus for me!). On top of that, every time I come the music is on point!"}
{"text":"We came to visit this place once again - but Maggie made the best salad which we ever had over here.
Thank we will be back.."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over a year now. I started coming for the Monthly car meets they host, and the food. 

Customer Service: Every single time I come here it is always the best service ever. Everybody there is super friendly and willing to help. Also the owner or his son is always there and they take the time to check on the clients and try to improve as much as possible.

The food: I became a Vegan 10 month's ago but before then the fish was always fresh and of good quality. My only gripe is that they don't have a Real Vegetarian, or Vegan menu to pick from. When I eat there I have to custom build my own food but the ingredients are always good. 

The Atmosphere: They hold a Car Meet every month and it is pretty cool. They have all types of vehicles, everything from domestic to import to bikes it's pretty sweet. They usually have a DJ booth playing music and they do free raffles. I won fifty dollar at one of these events. 

Discounts: They give military discount and if you are there for the meet they give you discounts as well. They also have a loyalty program that uses your phone number.

The good: Excellent service, good food and a pretty cool environment.

The Bad: Not enough options for Vegetarians or Vegans. Also the last two car meets security has had their panties in a bunch, the guy this time was much nicer but the guy last month was yelling and trying to kick everybody out. This time they took away the music. I hope management figures it out because I have a feelings the meets might stop."}
{"text":"Looove this place!! Some toppings cost extra but it still costs less than some \"more popular\" places. The staff is absolutely wonderful. And I love their Hawaiian poke option they recently added."}
{"text":"First time in & service was amazing! Food was fresh, delicious & big portions! i ordered a 'make it yourself' spicy tuna & salmon on greens bowl. you get to pick sides & sauces. I loved it so much i had to order something to go!! I ordered the Katana. You can order any style Burrito, roll or bowl. Great concept & the owners are friendly hands on & always around."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! As soon as you walk in you get this positive vibe as the staff welcomes you. They have such a large variety of foods to choose from. Out of all the sushi burrito places this is my favorite !"}
{"text":"Not great quality meats. We got the meal for free cause they were missing all kinds of ingredients."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING. I came in after going to the gym looking for something on the healthier side and this place had it. Great service and very knowledgeable team. They all had all my answers to what was in their sauces. I order the custom bowl and their brown rice was cooked really well, not crunchy or too soft. Chicken had a good flavor and especially loved their Avocado cilantro sauce... I'll definitely make another visit soon!! Thanks Yoshi Burritos!"}
{"text":"honestly the only reason im giving two stars is cause the staff was nice. there was nothing really worthwhile about this. no flavor whatsoever and its more expensive than other places that ive been to. i basically paid more money for a lesser burrito than i couldve got somewhere else. the rice was sub par the salmon tasted old the eel sauce wasnt that great just about everything was subpar"}
{"text":"Poke bowls are my favorite food trend of 2017, and this place is great. There's plenty of fish, all the flavors are right. It's a perfect $10 meal."}
{"text":"The food is great. Ingredients are fresh. Get a lot of food for the reasonable pricing. Location is ideal. I stop in at least once a week."}
{"text":"I am pretty impressed. I didn't think I would like it. But I guess I found a new sushi bowl spot . the Bonus is good because I don't have to travel to far from home."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place since it's nearby and overall I was very pleased.  The employees were very very nice. Prices were good, I had the spicy tuna bowl. The portions were good and everything tasted just fine. I would definitely go back.

The owner rung me up and he too was very nice.  They still have a few small things that need to be taken care of, but that's normal with a new business."}
{"text":"Hello yelpers!

This is an update from my last visit here. First of all the owner Harland had talk to me about coming back and trying it out again. Me and my Fiancé came in and ask for the owner Harland but he wasnt in,we both got bowls I got the build your own bowl with ahi tuna, salmon and yellowtail with seaweed salad, tamatoes, and masago, to top it off with wasabi aoli and spicy mayo. My Fiancé got the yellowtail poke bowl. We both got it to go, once we got home we started digging in. Mine and my fiancé's bowl's were tasty and fresh, it was a big improvement from the last visit with layers of freshness and flavor to hit your taste buds. The fish wasn't mushy and there was no red dye in the tuna.

Overall the experience with customer service is excellent with the staff and like i said this place is clean. This place is convenient since its close to the LVAC gym, this will be our to go spot after the gym to get our GAINS! Thank you to Harland and to his friendly staff for making a better experience for us this time."}
{"text":"After going to many sushi burrito places... I'm least impressed with this one. Service was incredibly slow (with the girl writing down 'no cucumbers' on the post it for my order... and then the next girl attempting to throw cucumbers on until I said NO! She never LOOKED at the post it!). Employees seemed to be more engrossed with chatting to each other... rather than the customers in front of them. I got the Kimono and meh. It was ok. Sauce was ok... it was just not impressive at all.

With sushi burrito and poke places all around Vegas... I would rather go anywhere else but Yoshi Burrito."}
{"text":"Located next to Cinnaholic off of Grand Canyon Quietly opened on Saturday, 11/19/16 is yet the newest eatery serving poke bowls and sushi burritos.

Service was very friendly including the owner who came over to say hello as I was finishing lunch. Fish and additions were fresh, similar to offerings at other poke places."}
{"text":"Really good and very filling.  I have tried a couple of the burritos.  The fish is pretty fresh, and I like that they offer three different wraps for the rolls.  There is something for everyone.  They also use recyclable material for their doggie bags.  That's a really nice touch.  I have been twice and will go again.  I'm really looking forward to trying a bunch of stuff.  I did see someone else's post mention that they have a frequent rewards program, but I was never told about that.  The only reason they got three stars is 1 - they don't have many sauces to choose from and the ones they do have are either really hot or really bland.  2 - Their staff doesn't seem to know that much about service.  One girl talked to me while she was getting stuff out of the oven.  I couldn't hear what she was telling me about the menu.  One of the guys told us he would bring out the appetizer we ordered, and he never did.  I had to go up and get it.  The staff just needs a little more training in customer service.  I felt a little like I was at McDonald's drive thru.  If they spent a little more time with customers - especially ones that are new - the customer may just find their favorite and come back over and over."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to check this place out since it's right by cinnaholic and our favorite target. The place is very clean  and staff is super friendly and helpful.

I got their signature ahi poke bowl. Everything tasted very fresh  and the flavors meshed very well together. Nice size portion of ahi as well.

My sister got the Buddha roll, which she very was good but not exactly extraordinary. She did note that the portion of fish was greater than topping which we appreciate since you are mostly paying for the fish :P the burrito itself wasn't particular large, but still satisfying.

We also tried the Mexican street corn which we felt was a miss due to the lack of lime. 

Not my number one choice for poke/sushi burritos, but it is a viable option when nearby."}
{"text":"A recent trend that has taken over Las Vegas is the concept of a sushi burrito. Yes, you heard that right, a sushi burrito. First sushi donuts, then sushi tacos, now sushi burritos. Hey, I'm not complaining. 
We went to Yoshi, next to Cinnaholic, for lunch. The sushi burrito is just what it sounds like, and after conversing with one of the managers, she recommended the Katana. It had all my favorite sushi ingredients: Spicy tuna, Shrimp tempura, Crab, Avocado, \"Yum Yum\" sauce aka spicy mayo, and Sesame Soy sauce. As I saw her create my burrito, I kept thinking to myself, this is so much bigger than just a normal sushi roll - it's obnoxiously large!!- but how does it taste? When I took my first bite, my tastebuds went into sushi ecstasy! This was one the of best things I've had in a really long time. I'm so jealous our desert sister city has a billion places to grab these and you can even order them online. Sushi Burritos on demand?! Please migrate to Phoenix! Please!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi burrito place. Fresh fish, delicious sauces, generous portions and great value. I ordered a variety of sushi for four people today and we all we very pleased, even the harshest of critics with us was raving about this place. We ordered the yoshi, miyagi, ronin, yellowtail poke bowl, ahi tuna poke bowl and some sides. I thought that I ordered just enough for four people, but the portions were so generous that we have some left for later. Everything was delicious and healthy. This is now our new go to place for sushi."}
{"text":"Yoshi Burrito is a new spot and honestly, I'm extremely satisfied . I'm typically very picky when it comes to sushi, especially when it's turned into a burrito.. Today I had my 2nd sushi burrito from Yoshi and again, in love . Their food is always fresh, filling and always hits the spot just right  The staff are super friendly and very accommadating. Today I ordered the Buddha but didn't want anything too spicy, so they removed the jalapeños.. I highly recommend this spot to anyone who loves sushi with a twist! ?????"}
{"text":"This wonderful new addition to Vegas is next to my favorite place cinnaholic and now I have two great things next to one another. 

I order the burrito with yellowtail not sure the name is my favored here, also tried a teriyaki bowl for the first time and was very impressed. 

Clean, staff seems a little new but hey they just opened will be back"}
{"text":"Yoshi birritos has the absolute nicest and happiest staff ever! Everything was very fresh and yummy, cant wait to return."}
{"text":"The good: the food here is good. Fresh ingredients. Chipotle-like setup. I ordered a preset ninja burrito. Good mix of fillings. Plus I got a FREE miso soup for checking in on Yelp. The bad: to call it a burrito is a misnomer. It's more like a glorified roll. The size of this ROLL is tiny. I finished it in 6 bites. The photos made it look like it would be the size of an actual burrito. IT'S NOT. Not sure why this place doesn't have more business...literally no one here on a Friday night dinner time. Plus they aren't closing for another 3 hours and one of the employees kept sweeping up a storm with a broom right next to me. Really unsanitary"}
{"text":"Its my 2nd time here and it didnt disappoint! staff was friendly and the food was great! G had great customer service! 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Absolutly wonderful service could not ask for a more friendly person in the other side of the counter!!! Got exactly what i wanted and i am happy to say that my stomach is surely satisfied"}
{"text":"Nice new spot!!! Quality great Tasting food. I had the Ahi tuna bowl. Wow!!! Great flavor. Quick too. GreAt lunch spot if your on limited timeframe. Support your local spots."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, the establishment was clean.

The menu is primarily poke based, but upon seeing that they had elote in a cup, I was very excited.

For only $1.55 a pop, it came in a good sized container for 1.5 people.
Inside, it carried charred corn which was nice, the melted cheese was an interesting mix despite it not having the normal cotija, it had some of the red powder which idr, .. there was mayo involved, and a sprig of cilantro, BUT IT WAS MISSING A VERY IMPORTANT INGREDIENT: the lime! 
What I'm used to is bbqed corn slathered in butter, mayo, cotija cheese, the red powder and lime juice, so this was a departure from home.

I'm really sad that I didn't try it while I was there, otherwise I would have said something. What would have been a 4 star review shot down to two. There was no acidity whatsoever, just pure creaminess - I was a sad panda."}
{"text":"Their bowls & burritos aren't that much different from any other places in town, but I will say that their staff is super friendly & their overall customer service is outstanding.  

If you're an LVAC member, they offer you a discount. And they also have a rewards program for frequent customers."}
{"text":"Pretty decent menu with a little bit of variety. The fish tasted fresh, which is a definite plus. The restaurant was clean and the staff was super nice and friendly! They also had 90s jams playing and you really can't go wrong with that ;) I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best bowls around. Somehow the portion size is always slightly different depending on staff. They are all very young and seem to be learning. Nevertheless the ingredients are too notch and I always enjoy their sushi bowls."}
{"text":"I always build my own sushi burrito with same ingredients to compare between different restaurants. Yoshi's is decent but a bit blander compared to other sushi burrito joints. Rice lacks flavor. Nice touch that they scoop up fresh avocado straight from the fruit half. Prefer jaburritos to this place."}
{"text":"Went in on a recommendation from a friend. Waited in line for 15 min. Then waited another 40 min for food??
WTF then asked the girl if my order was ready. Nope sorry we have to get the postmate orders done first?? 
Food was ok not the best. Have been to Sushi Tower and it is the best in Las Vegas!! Don't waste your time Yoshi Burritos sucks and service is crap. Ken Mckinster"}
{"text":"I would recommend coming here if you are looking for an affordable, quick and healthier alternative around the area. I usually create my own bowls and I like that they have a good selection of toppings. Price for creating your own bowl is between $6-9 but the portion is big. I ordered the yellowtail and the salmon it didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked it to be but it was good. Overall It wouldn't be my go to poke spot but I would come here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, and the sweetest people. I highly recommend the bowls and taro. Try it!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest: I didn't think I'd enjoy the food. When I was stepping up to order, I thought. \"this is probably a mistake.\" Subway/Qdoba style places just tend to have that effect on me.

Luckily I was wrong--the food is actually pretty good; the sushi isn't the best you're going to find but it's good enough, the serving size is generous, and the staff is friendly. It's actually a place I would go back to.

I recommend the Yoshi wrap, which is what I had."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! This place was a definite find! The food is always fresh. The staff is very friendly and accommodating if you order something and want extra sauce or no avocado for example. I love this place, I've gotten everyone at my work hooked on this place. I highly recommend checking it out! I always get there Ninja Burrito, good price for quality food."}
{"text":"I had the BEST experience with this restaurant this evening. Being a newby to sushi burritos and bowls, the lady helped me figure out my perfect burrito, and had a very pleasant conversation with me during it. I decided to have spicy tuna, crab and shrimp tempura in my burrito and it was delightful!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow ! I have been here twice already back to back since its opened a week ago and I absolutely love this place ! It's so yummy!! I tried the Yoshi burrito which was amazing and full of flavor . On my next visit I went with some friends so we got to try a few different things on the menu. This time I got the Tiger Roll and the meat was so tender and good . My friend got the ahi tuna poke which was amazing and we also tried the samurai roll . All full of flavor and so good . I would highly recommend this new spot for sure . Friendly staff and super clean . I will definitely be back for sure ."}
{"text":"Local boy! First timer! Food and service, \"ONO\" enjoyed the Ahi poke bowl and grilled teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"Very good ', creative concept, fresh clean friendly-even the guests are! I let the prep guy pick his fave and it was great! I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Had a simple dinner of Hawaiian Poke with ponzu sauce, rice and side salad of seaweed for dinner tonight.  The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable. It's the closest Poke place to my house for convenience, but there's a lot of other competition out there especially around 215 and Rainbow."}
{"text":"Update: Their old prices are back?! Raising a star for that and will return to the original 5 once I get a chance to go back and have another taste for myself! thanks Yoshi Burritos!

Past:
There has been a price increase which is rather substantial with their menu change, and even smaller portions to go with it, along with a reduction of their rewards program. The food, service, and quality has all otherwise been good and stayed the same. It's a bit of a shame since it was one of my favorite places close by, too. 

The owner responded stating that they would have went out of business otherwise, but now I can't really say much to distinguish them from the other comparable poke places. I just wish I had reviewed and promoted them more before so that they wouldn't have had to raise their prices! I can see how the location isn't very visible to the streets and thus might affect business as well without word of mouth and promotions."}
{"text":"Food is great, fresh, tasty and reasonably priced! Make your own is the way to go, my salmon and spicy tuna bowl was very satisfying. 

However, I've been here a few times and service has been consistently slow, I know they are new, but hopefully they can make a bowl faster than what I have experienced. Watching the person behind counter making the bowl is just painful sometimes, way too slow."}
{"text":"I am glad to have this place opened not far from my place.  The foods are tasty and good value, will be back!."}
{"text":"Place is awesome! Mine and my girlfriends new favorite spot! Staff is excellent and very helpful"}
{"text":"My fiancé Ordered the \"ronin\" burrito and the spicy tuna tasted funny. She was sick within 10 minutes of eating it and we had to stay home for the day."}
