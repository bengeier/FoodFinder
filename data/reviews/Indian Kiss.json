{"text":"Tried their take out recently. Big portion, but I found the food to be just ok. Don't get me wrong, it's good but there's better places in the neighborhood for Indian."}
{"text":"Service was pleasant, but slow. This is definitely not fast food. They make to order so lunches are a min 15 minute wait.   Also, My chicken has a strange texture, too tough am hoping it's actually chicken. You really have to put a lot of trust in a food service that has the advantage of masking their proteins in heavy sauces. I could just be paranoid, but am not going to go back.   Driving there is not recommended either. The proprietor of the convenience store next door threatened to have my car towed when he didn't immediately realize i was a customer of the plaza."}
{"text":"First off,  let me preface this review with saying that ALL Indian food makes me run to the bathroom and evacuate, not just this place.  Bon appetite!  Firstly, the location is phenomenal!  It's walking distance from my condo and if I'm stopping there on my way home from work, there's plenty of parking along the side, next to the Gas Station!  Secondly, the price is great!  My wife and got an order of Butter Paneer, naan, and rice and it only cost us $25.  One order was more than enough for both of us.  We always call ahead and order due to it being a take-out establishment and not a traditional restaurant.  It's always ready when we get there which is pretty awesome considering it's all made-to-order!  The taste of the food is really what matters and this place tastes great!  Everything I've tried from here is has been awesome!.    I've never been to India and eaten their food, (because every Indian person I've ever talked to tells me India is a horrible place and I should never go,) but having Indian Kiss steps away from where I live is amazing!  Now, where's that bathroom?"}
{"text":"I've only had one thing here - the butter chicken. The first time, it was amazing. I had it during some Junction festival when vendors were selling smaller portions of their wares for cheaper. I ordered it again during regular working hours and for some reason, it wasn't quite as good. Also, the chickpea:meat ratio was too high."}
{"text":"Ok great place!!! Drive by this place randomly and finally fit take out. No regrets. I had to call ahead because the wait time was a bit long, 45min. When j got there the girl was super nice and have excellent customer service. And while I was waiting she was friendly and very helpful.  It's kinda pricy but you do get a lot of food.   Ok let's talk about the food. I got the butter chicken:  deliciousness blends of spices. Chicken was clean and not dry. It's a little on the tomatoy tasting side but some ppl love that. I will def try the other dishes next time. I also got the chicken biryani. Very yummy.   What I didn't like was the naan, it was too oily and a lil chewy.   The place doesn't allow for dine in.  All in all can't wait to go back!!! Everything seems to be made fresh."}
{"text":"I love how close it is to my place.   I've ordered a few times and have never been disappointed in my selection. I recently introduced my friend to this place and Indian food in general and she also enjoyed.   The chicken tikka and butter chicken are absolutely delicious! The veggie korma was pretty tasty too. Portions are generous, we even had enough leftover for lunch the next day! But the one thing on the menu that you absolutely need to order is the garlic naan. Your taste buds will thank me. Use that delicious bread to sop up all that yummy sauce"}
{"text":"My favourite Indian take-out in north-west Toronto. Hands-down. The chicken tikka masala and chicken biryani will not disappoint you, I promise.  The service is always great too. The last time, they said my nhan bread was burned, and insisted on giving me a credit on my next order, even though I repeatedly told them the nhan looked great."}
{"text":"Indian Kiss is hands down the freshest, most flavorful Indian restaurant in the Junction. I moved into a nearby condo about 14 months ago and popped my head in once to check the prices...they seemed a tad higher than what I was used to but I finally caved a few weeks later and was NOT disappointed. Have ordered from them over a dozen times, often for guests who've loved it too.  Yummy stuff."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing, have been ordering from them for the past 2 years, always very friendly service, very generous portions and the 30 min wait is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Food is good in general, but it is a bit to pricey for what you get. I got some lamb curry and chicken masala, but it came with no more than five small pieces of each. I would have given it more stars if I didn't feel overcharged"}
