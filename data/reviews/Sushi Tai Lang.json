{"text":"Ive been there couples of time and always had great service with friendly staff! Good variety and quality of food(and excellent price!) . i only wish they add tuna on their menu but besides that everything fill my requirements for an all u can eat sushi. Will come back for sure ..especially on lunch time since the price is very low."}
{"text":"Favorite all you can eat sushi restaurant in Montreal. Lunch is 16 dallors taxes and tips included. For the price, the sushi is nice. A tip: go there at around 1-2 where there are less people. The sushi tastes fresher. Really nice dragon rolls."}
{"text":"I go dear regularly for lunch. It used to be 13$ for lunch if you pays cash, now  its 16$ and its still a great deal.   The sushis are better than at most all you can eat sushis. I mean nobody pretends its the finest sushis ever, but the rice tastes good, there is a lot of variety and the fish tastes fresh. Their nigris are really good, and so are their rock'and'roll maki rolls.  Service fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The start of our gastronomic experience kicked off in a way you'd hope in all top quality restaurants: being screamed at by the welcoming host the moment you step in the door. After much confusion we realised he was just trying to tell us that the $11.99 \"all you can eat\" offer had finished for the day and was now $14. Just in case we couldn't quite get this, he helpfully \"wrote\" the number 14 on his hand with his finger, about 14 times, just to make sure the message was clear. Well, we didn't even want to take the \"all you can eat\" offer, but thanks anyway for making sure the price was imprinted in my brain until the day I die. Being determined diners (read: hungry), this wasn't enough to deter us, so we decided to give it a go. We opted for the $8.99 lunch special, which consisted of a choice of meal (hot or sushi), soup, salad and a drink. We waited quite a long time for the soup and salad to come, so in the meantime we took in the surroundings, which consisted of: 1. Other diners waiting endlessly for their meal, 2. Cheery Christmas lights (in October), and 3. A waiter who looked about 12 years old, moping around the place but not seeming to be really doing anything. Eventually we got the soup and salad, well I say salad - it was iceberg lettuce in a bowl with dressing poured over it. Despite the simplicity, it was actually rather refreshing and the miso soup was not too bad either. We considered this to be a good start and decided the food here was probably pretty acceptable. WE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. In fact, the dressing-drizzled iceberg turned out to be the best thing on the menu. Here are a few tips if you decide to come here: 1. Bring your own rice. What they use appears to be cooked several days earlier and recycled probably with the help of the microwave (see below). 2. Hell, bring your own sushi. To find out why, read on. 3. Don't order the sushi with the \"grilled\" fillings. Unless you want to watch the chef warm it up in the microwave (see above), and you enjoy food eating food that is so dry you may as well have ordered a large glass of Sahara. 4. Forget about the drink. If you're lucky they'll bring it just as you're finishing the meal. If not, just grab it on your way out.  As for the service, the restaurant wasn't busy (it was 3pm on a Sunday), yet there were several \"waiters\", none of which seemed to have the first clue what was going on.  Helpfully, when we'd finished the meal, the waiter brought us the \"all you can eat\" menu (even though we didn't take that offer - even though I did still remember the price), which was either because a) we still looked hungry, or b) he thought we hadn't had enough punishment. And when we paid the bill, the guy taking the payment had a distinct \"sorry to have ruined your afternoon, I understand you're probably not going to tip us\" look on his face. In summary, don't eat here unless you had your tastebuds extracted at an early age or you consider good service in a restaurant \"overrated\"."}
{"text":"The price is very cheap. Usually all you can eat sushi restaurants are 27$ or so per person on weekends, but this one was only 11.99$ at lunch. To celebrate their one year anniversary, it was super cheap when I went.  There is a big selection of delicious food, but sometimes the orders get confused and they give you the wrong food. Sushi is nicely made and all the hot dishes seem freshly made and, well, hot. Many vegetarian options as well, which they mark with a little vegetable icon (cute and practical!). The spicy avocado rolls and the deep fried banana desserts are to die for!!  However, service is a bit slow and the waiters seem inexperience. The cashier made it VERY CLEAR that tips aren't included in the bill. I wish they could've been a bit more polite, but overall my experience was pretty good and I highly recommend this place for a rather cheap, filling and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"It was late, I was hungry, this place was close at hand. I figured, a miso soup, maybe some gyoza, and out the door. the folks behind the counter looked pre-occupied and shifty. Some bigger, vaguely sinister guys lurking about. Other than that, the place was empty. I watched the kid assemble my order in the back. He sneezed, wiped his schnot up with his bare hands and continued to prepare my stuff.  WTF? Not wanting to incur an ugly scenario, and bowing to my cowardice, I paid the few shekels for the food, depositing it immediately into the garbage can out front, and went to the Vietnamese place next door to get something to eat..."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. All u can eat sushi for cheap. Free wifi, though it can be kind of slow. Over all, I liked this place and will most likely come back to it whenever I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"I was curious to try this restaurant as i saw it every time i walked on St-Denis street. This is a pretty new restaurant as it only opens a couples of months ago. My Girlfriend  was feeling to eat sushis so we decided to try this restaurant.The decoration is nice and the server are amiable, and we were pleasantly surprise by the quality of the food.   It's an all you can eat and for 20$ you can eat as much  sushis you want.  I recommend you don't eat too many sushi of the same kind and choose to taste more flavour. The service is quick and we enjoy a nice evening as it was one cold Montreal night outside so the sushi warm our heart and satisfy our appetite much !  I recommend it !      J'était curieux d'essayer ce nouveau restaurant, que j'avais vu chaque fois que je déambulait sur la rue St-Denis.     Ma copine avait le goût de manger des sushi nous avons donc décidé de l'essayer  C'est un nouveau restaurant ouvert que depuis quelques mois seulement.  La décoration est appropriée à un restaurant de sushi ce que j'ai bien apprécié, les personnel est très aimable, et nous avons été plaisament surpris par la qualité de la nourriture.     Pour 20$ pour pouvez manger autant de sushi que vous le voulez !  Je vous recommande de ne pas commander seulement des sushi de la même sorte afin de pouvoir goûter le plus de saveurs possibles ! Les service est rapide et nous avons bien aprécié cette belle soirée  passée par cette froide nuit de décembre à déguster d'excellents sushis !  Je vous le recommande !"}
{"text":"Moyennement propre, sushis très ordinaires et bourrés de riz. Par contre c'est pas cher. Ils ne prennent pas les cartes, ils ne parlent pas tous français. Nous n'y retournerons pas."}
{"text":"The sushi is normal, the miso soup is so so. They don't provide Wasabi's  and ginger , you need to ask them, then they will take to you. I feel so bad. The worst thing is my boyfriend's and my stomach feel weird and uncomfortable after we ate the food. Don't go anymore."}
{"text":"MONTREAL TRIP (May 2016) Very very affordable sushi specials! Was a staple during my visit and the service was pretty alright too."}
{"text":"ROTTEN SALMON. Took one bite and spat it out immediately. Put me off for the rest of the meal. Food poisoning is on the menu at this place.   I'm not a picky person by any stretch of the imagination, and honestly would never set my expectations high for an all-you-can eat sushi place, but I was hungry and I thought it would do the trick. When I was done gagging from the salmon, I went downstairs to discreetly tell the sweet waitress that their salmon was well past its expiration date. I informed her of the fetid fish in a way so that the other patrons wouldn't hear my complaint. To be fair I've eaten here once before and the food was alright. I figured they were just having an off night. The waitress was very kind and came to apologetically clear my nearly untouched plate. I finished my vegetable tempura, didn't touch any more of my fish rolls and went to pay my bill. The owner of the restaurant was at the cash as the waitress handed me my bill. I told them that all I'd eaten was the tempura, miso soup and  salad and asked if they could give me a reduced rate on account of the bad fish. The owner refused, told me not to worry about it and said the salmon was fine. I expressed my dissatisfaction and finally dropped $25 on my $20 bill (having worked in restaurants for 10 years, I didn't want to stiff my waitress. It's not her fault that the owner doesn't give a shit about his customers). $25 for some mediocre tempura and a horrible taste in my mouth that I can't seem to shake.   Suffice to say I'm never returning to this restaurant again and neither should you, if you care about your health."}
{"text":"Nothing exceptional, do not stand out in quality but VERY GOOD PRICE! For lunch it cost us two only 25$ tips included! And it's all you can eat!!!!"}
{"text":"Must-try!  Amazing fresh all-you-can-eat sushi and other Asian dishes for $11 at lunch and $18 at dinner. Crazy inexpensive prices for delicious sushi. The place is nice and has different levels, very friendly and quick service.  The owner at the cash was rude and didn't say one word while we were paying but that didn't change how good the sushi was."}
{"text":"Sushi in the Latin Quarter!  The pricing was confusing.  There was a sign outside that advertised a deal.  Inside, the prices were more expensive.  Oldest trick in the book?  Well, the interior was pretty cool, and the sushi ended up being pretty good after a bit of clarification/negotiation.  Plus the waitress was very nice."}
