{"text":"Food, Drinks & Service A+++++++++ The waitress was extremely friendly and made several great suggestions. She kept bringing us sample tasters of off menu items through the meal. The food arrived quickly, presentation was beautiful, portions were perfect and everything tasted delicious.  Try this kosher restaurant out, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Una experiencia gastron√≥mica Kosher gigantesca ... todo estaba perfecto tanto la cualidad de los productos que del servicio ... Felicitaciones !"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS RESTAURANT.  This was the worst meal I've had in Toronto.  The extremely overpriced food ($50-$80 for an entree!) tasted like it was prepared by a fry-cook.  Unlike the old Marron which had a classically-trained French chef, the new dishes are very dull and unoriginal.  Our dishes did not taste fresh (crusty tough meat, solidified gross gravy).  The service was moderately competent (although they made numerous mistakes with orders and information) and more-or-less friendly.  Nonetheless, this new iteration of Marron (without the old chef) is the worst value for money I've experienced in this city.  Moreover, even if the dishes were a fraction of the price, the quality still leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"We came here right after landing in Toronto and went straight to the restaurant they treated us incredibly took our orders right away and staff was very good! We ordered the ribeye steaks and they were cooked to perfection! And the side dishes were quite great as well! Highly recommend for business meetings and when you want to treat yourself or for special occasions."}
{"text":"Yum! Love coming here. Recently we went for lunch and it's nice and quiet at that time. If you're going for dinner make sure to make a reservation. Elegant kosher meat menu. Great for celebrating occasions. Dates. Meetings. Try the burger !"}
{"text":"I was quite skeptical about trying out this place as the interior was a very basic. Upon sitting down with a graded and presented with the option of drinks. This is not a place to have drinks as everything that was offered or suggested on bar rail was very cheap alcohol (Smirnoff, cheap rum no belevedere or high end stuff).. so we decided to just stick to whiskey (jack Daniels).  We decided to get a charcuterie board which was all kosher beef. It was delicious so we decided to order a main course, since there were two of us we opted for the 32oz steak and decided we would just share.  I have to say being a food junkie and having tried over 100s of restaurants, the flavour in the steak was just Unbelievable! I must say do not judge this restaurant by its design or bar menu... But just wait until you try it's authentic home made recipe style food! Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Since the new ownership several weeks ago many changes have been implemented.  Firstly, the menu is fantastic. The presentation is very impressive, and since I've been there more than once, I can confidently say that it's quite consistent regardless of how busy.  The service is definitely a highlight, with the friendly staff and even the owners frequenting our table, ensuring that all is to our liking.  We started with a tuna tartar, and then had the boneless rib eye steaks as our main. To be honest, my steak (15oz) had more fat than meat on it, but it was good nonetheless.  You can ask for a sampler plate of the desserts, which, by the way, were quite exquisite considering that they're parve.  If you're a couple, get ready to fork out AT LEAST $250. I'd say it's worth it (for a celebration of some sort) and recommend you try it... At least once. After all, how many fine-dining kosher meat establishments are you familiar with?.."}
