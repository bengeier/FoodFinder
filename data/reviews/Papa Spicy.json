{"text":"I went to Papa Spicy three times today:  first time, last time, only time.  I am royally pissed with the twits on Yelp who so highly recommended the restaurant's signature dish, the spicy fish hot pot.  Some people clearly have their taste buds ins tuches.   For $21-$30 you get a tasteless, seemingly boiled fish replete with all fins. You have the privilege of adding broth to the dish for an extra $4. Miniscule  quantities of veggies are added at $1 per selection but $2 for every choice beyond three. Go figure!  We paid an extra $4 to add a few thin rolled-up slices of beef.  We asked for taro noodles and eventually got 5 carefully wrapped tiny bundles insufficient to even remotely serve one person.  The dish cost us about $40, an outrageous amount for unmitigated tasteless crap. Management and service are less than competent.  We had to complain to get our taro noodles.  Our waiter seemed content with his explanation that we got tasteless green squares of kelp instead because on their printed selection sheet the checked off English \"taro noodles\" was mistranslated as \"kelp\" in an adjoining Chinese symbol.  We had to hound our waiter to get a ladle and spoons.  Initially he delivered only 3 spoons despite there being 4 members in our group.  Counting was obviously not his forte. This was undoubtedly the most disappointing Chinese dish I have experienced in my 66 years on this planet."}
{"text":"Good food, loved the barbecue fish. Wait time is not too long. Staff are friendly too."}
{"text":"I ordered the Turboat fish classic spicy flavour and added yam, dried beancurd, King oyster mushroom, black fungus, needle mushroom, radish, and chinese cabbage. In total including tax and 10% gratuity came to $55.86. For 2 hungry people, we devoured this. It's not the cheapest hot pot but for the quality, it's worth it. The turboat fish came highly recommended but next time, I will try a cheaper fish to see if my opinion changes. The classic spicy flavour is at most, medium spicy to most people. Next time, I will ask to make it spicier or try a different flavour."}
{"text":"we had a bbq fish and 3 veg sides. Food was okay, fuel burnt too fast, just wish service could be less sloppy and more welcoming. I only reviewed because they offered 10% off if we put a review on yelp."}
{"text":"Overpriced food. Cash only. Worst service. Coupon rejected without stating take out only. Not recommended and will never come again."}
{"text":"This place was actually pretty decent. We got the halibut with sichuan soup base and it was pretty much a pre-set hot pot. However, service was relatively quick and we were sat down pretty quickly on a Sunday night. For two people - the proportions were pretty much spot on and we finished the entire thing. However, there was nothing really special and we felt like it was kind of overpriced. Tips are included in the final bill."}
{"text":"Been there twice for there grilled fish, or you can call it fish hot pot. It is GREAT! It has good varieties in flavor base choice. It's not overly salty but not blah. Taste right good for me!  Very worth of trying."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim with some friends one night not really knowing what this place was. We didn't go for the hot pot type meal, but instead ordered a few of the regular dishes to share: rice with shrimp, stewed pork ribs with potatoes, spicy fried chicken with chillies, some kind of noodles with vegetables, and custard buns.   All the food was really excellent -- we were pleasantly surprised since we'd never heard of the place before. The fried chicken was delicious and crispy without being greasy, and the noodles had a lot of garlic flavour which I enjoyed. This place differs from your standard Chinese restaurant in that the menu is much smaller, offering a few dishes which are very different from each other rather than an enormous menu with many variations on the same dishes (which is good in its own way, just not what you get here). I'd say it's also a little more expensive than typical Chinatown fare. We were all very pleased with the food and will come back.   The only downside to this place is that they take cash only, which we were slightly unprepared for, so take note of that if you go. Otherwise an excellent find!"}
{"text":"The menu looked good and the food on customers' tables looked great so we decided to give it a try.   The waiter was very helpful and answered our questions. They explained that for the hot pots you choose a fish($20-30), a soup base($3-5), and then 3 veggies($3 and then 1.99 for each additional). Plus there are other dishes and you can have chicken hot pot. We also asked for tea and water- both were nice. The tea was good and strong; the water had slices of lime.   We ordered tilapia, Szechuan spicy, with frog legs, noodles, radish, cabbage, and mushrooms. The fish itself is fantastic- well seasoned and cooked. It was golden and crispy outside and soft inside. My partner was also very happy that it was filled and covered in peppercorns (there are also nonspicy options). I think there should have been more veggies though since they were almost nonexistent after cooking for while. The frog legs were also a little bland but not bad. The noodles were good. Next time I will probably order things like noodles, tofu, yams, mushrooms- things that can really withstand the simmer.  It came out to about $46 for two people including the 10% tip which is automatically added. Not bad but not cheap. They also only take cash but have an ATM. The ATM charges you $1.75 but they gave me $2 to cover the fee- a very nice surprise!  Overall, we were very happy with the meal and will be adding it to our list of dinner spots. If you like fish, hot pot, or spicy food I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of Americanized Chinese foods but not so much of classic Chinese dishes like hotpot and barbecue fish. My recent visit to China changed that completely. To compare with barbecue fish I ate in Shenzhen recently, I decided to try out Papa Spicy in Chinatown.   The ambience of this place is very similar to Chinese places in Chinatown, nothing special. We got Bass fish with classic spicy soup base. We topped it up with mushroom, potatoes, cabbage and bean sprouts. It was very tasty, even the cabbage tasted good with their amazing soup base.   P.S If you can't handle Asian spicy, make sure you ask the server for less spicy option unless you like that morning fire."}
{"text":"We visited this location after craving spicy chinese hotpot but not wanting to pay the price. Papa Spicy specialized in \"BBQ/Hotpot fish\". Essentially, a whole fish is either grilled or fried and then put into a hotpot where it bathes in a soup broth (there are 6 choices carrying from spicy to not spicy). You can then select what you want to add as toppings from a list at a fee of $2 for vegetables and $4 for meat (the toppings are the regular hotpot choices). The dish then comes in a large tray on a burner with the fish and the toppings bathing in the soup base.   We went for the $20.99 fish (mainly because neither of us knew our fishes...)and added fresh tofu, cabbage, vermicelli and beef. Together, with two bowls of rice, it came to a total of $47 including tax and tips.   The food while it satisfied our cravings for hotpot, was in my opinion a bit too much on the oily side. Everything was covered with a thin film of red chilli oil. The fish also came cold ... Which was indicative of it being prepared ahead of time and frozen/defrosted? Toppings were not the most generous but not too bad either.   Overall, not a bad experience but I don't think I would come back on a regular basis  They take cash only and charge a mandatory 10% tip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a franchise. I would say the taste is consistent and the amount of each order is adequate. I overheard that the restaurant is partnered with the other restaurant called Tasty Hunan Cuisine. Both make spicy food, such as a hot pot style bbq fishes, or regular Chinese stir style spicy food.   I don't usually enjoy these super spicy food since the taste is very strong. However, this restaurant does a better job to keep the spicy flavour but also make each order flavorful.  We ordered the country style stir-fried pork with green pepper, steamed tilapia,  and Lettuce with Chinese cheese sauce. I have to see the chef did a real job to highlight the specific flavour in each dish. It is spicy for the pork but due to the green peppers and the garlic, it smells very tasty and refreshing. The lettuce with the sauce offers a different taste, which is more flavourful than those typical lettuce dishes in other Chinese restaurants. The taste of the fish is average but no flaw to make a critique on it.  I will definitely to revisit this place again next time in downtown."}
{"text":"Always a great place to try a fried fish hot pot experience. Not like your regular hot pot, this place is really yummy and authentic."}
{"text":"Ordering from this menu can be pretty confusing if you've never had hot pot style. The waitress here was extremely patient and helpful though. We ordered the bass bbq fish in classic spicy with 3 vegetable toppings and 1 meat topping. Rice is also extra by small bowls or big bowls.  Besides their main hotpot dishes they also have a variety of regular menu items.  The fish (like the reviews below) did come cold meaning it was pre-prepared which is fine I guess considering it still tasted excellent. Our bill came out to $56 after tax and tip. It feels a bit too expensive. I would prefer if the hotpot itself included some vegetables and toppings instead of having to get those extra (3 for $3 for veggies and $4 each for meat).  I would definitely come back though because I love this kind of food or hotpot in general.   Note: they are cash only but do accept wechat pay!"}
{"text":"This is such a yummy joint for spicy fish hot pot. I got the regular spicy broth with tilapia  and added veggies ($1 each for first 3) and meats ($3.99 each). So my pot ended up being a nice hot pot filled with crispy fried fish, lotus, beef slices, shrimp paste, tofu, beef tripe, and enoki mushrooms.   To accompany the food I ordered a bowl of rice. Wow, I never had before such a satisfying meal for lunch! The broth wasn't extremely spicy and had a flavourful taste. I really enjoyed chewing on the fish skin (my favourite part!) and dipping the fish meat back into the broth. Overall, the meal was highly enjoyable."}
{"text":"I never expected I can have authentic Chinese food here in Canada. But their food was so good that I would recommend to everyone who want to have authentic Chinese food. I ordered the fish pot with classic spicy. The fish is fresh and tasty. Will come again! Very good service and decent priced."}
{"text":"Me and my bf are probably the very first customers when this location opened. It was great at that time, then we visited about 4 times after over the course of the next couple months and I have to say it became probably the worst restaurant in Chinatown.   Couple of things: the amount of food got significantly less while the price stayed the same. The containers got smaller as well. We didn't track how a specific flavour went for several months cuz every time we tried different options, in general I would say it's definitely not as good as it firstly opened. The dishes are very salty and consist of 90% pepper and 10% meat sliced into the minimum possible thickness.   Also need to be careful when reading the menu since there's some tricks they put in it. All the other fishes are priced per serve, only catfish is priced per pound, in the smallest font.   In terms of the payment! They accept every possible ways to pay EXCEPT debit and credit that everybody is using. They even went the extra mile to accept WeChat and Alipay which is popular in China and needed to be converted into Chinese currency. Oh did I forget to mention that they even take E-Transfer too. I don't know if there's some shady tax related issue involved in this but I just found it's really inconvenient for the customers. Yes they do cover the service fee if you withdraw cash from the ATM in store but why don't just put a debit machine in there!?   Lastly, by default they put a 10% tips on every bill regardless the group size. I just found it's uncomfortable that it becomes such a mandatory thing so the last time we insisted them to take it off and we paid whatever the amount we feel like.   I know this comment probably sounds like a rant about this restaurant but we are just so disappointed about how Papa Spicy has become."}
