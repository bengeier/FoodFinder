{"text":"You always know what you're getting at Rudy's. Great service, great food and a really laid back atmosphere. There always something on the TV and great music playing at just the right volume."}
{"text":"I lived in Austin for 2 years and Rudy's was my FAVORITE place in town. I thought I died and went to heaven when I saw that they were opening one in Chandler. Since it opened only a few weeks ago, I have visited twice but my husband is there almost daily. It is that good. This is a BBQ joint. Most Rudy's in Texas are attached to a gas station - this one is not. So this isn't a fancy restaurant - but who wants that for BBQ. You order at the counter, get your food served on butcher paper and get as many slices of white or wheat bread as you desire. The brisket melts in your mouth, get the cutters choice. Moist, delicious, heaven. You can order by the slice or pound increaments - such as 1/4lb etc. The pulled pork and ribs are also amazing. The sides could be a meal by themselves - the creamed corn - SCRUMPTOUS! Cole slaw - fabulous and potato salad - AWESOME. The only side I am not a big fan of are the beans - just don't personally like ranch beans. There are also puddings available for desert but i am always too full to try them. 
Since anyone who has ever visited the great state of Texas is now lining up to get their BBQ fix there is a line, but it moves fast and is absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Really good food.. The moist brisket, sausage and potato salad were amazing. Chicken wasn't bad.  Bread tasted like homemade but butter could have been softer. Affordable bbq in a fun setting."}
{"text":"This is the BBQ that anyone from The Lone Star State will know and be thankful for.  Having moved here roughly 8 years ago from Texas, my wife and I have been at a loss for \"real\" bbq until Rudy's opened up last week.  It's just as one should expect; brisket is lean and flavorful enough to stand on it's own without the use of sauce.  Thankfully, Rudy's \"sause\" is just an added bonus.  Be sure to choose carefully as Rudy's offers both moist and lean brisket.  The moist will be a bit fattier but no less wonderful.  Service was excellent and prompt for a wait that went out the door.  The fact that there was a group from Houston to our left and Austin to our right at the counter only confirmed what real bbq lovers already know about this wonderful establishment.
Menu is the same as Texas locations:  Pork sausage, turkey, brisket, ribs, etc, and  white bread with your meal.

Now please move into Gilbert."}
{"text":"I usually like this place but this evening I ordered a brisket sandwich and must report that it was sadly not up to par. It was over cooked and very dry. I had to over saturate it with sauce eat., Normally the meat is quite juicy and overall the sandwich or brisket alone are really good choices... I certainly hope this is not any indication of things to come, because if what I ate this time was typical or becomes the new standard I will avoid this place without question."}
{"text":"I had the lean brisket, which was tender but dry. The plan was to add bar-b-que sauce onto the meat but bottle dispensers were stingy with the sauce. The sides were good, but not outstanding. The lack of even a paper plate to put your meal on was the final straw. For the money spent I will not be going back to Rudy's."}
{"text":"Stopped late in the day...still had great selection of food tried ribs,brisket,and pulled pork...could not resist peach cobbler...everything was so delicious.  The service was excellent.   Purchased bottle of spicy sauce...nice bite to it!!!
Going back for breakfast..."}
{"text":"Wanted BBQ. low-and-behold two joints right next to eat other. The only reason we chose Rudy's was because it was busier, we assumed because it was better of the two....
Scanned the restaurant; picnic tables, clean and open. OK., awesome I can bring my toddler and not worry about her ruining other peoples' meals.
Greeted right away by a lady at the \"country store\". She asked us if have been before which we hadn't, I replied that we needed help (I have a20mo and a 4mo infant in a carrier). She came over to show us the menu, the line to place our orders and let us know that the cashier can give us samples of the meats. Fan-frickin-tabulous.


We figured out our order then went to the counter. ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE. 
Miss boring-as-all-get-out brunette. She didn't even look at us. HELLooooo.
She wasn't even up at the register, but back about a foot. I asked if they had a kid's menu, she mumbled something incoherent. What??? So 2 registers down was a young man so we passed on miss head in the clouds. As we head to the other register the cashier left. ARGGGGGG! Back to the brunette.
I start the order..... turkey sandwich and brisket sandwich..... to which she yells back and a man starts carving. Sandwiches were brought FAST. Then we ordered potato salad (get it yourself from the fridge), corn and new potatoes. She turns and gets the corn and potatoes, meanwhile my sandwiches are getting cold. COLD.
She tap-types on her register and then says our total. Excuse me, can I order drinks????? Her bubbly reply (add sarcasm) \"oh yeah\".

We grab napkins and a table, apply the bbq sauce and dig in..... to ice COLD meat sandwiches.

Quick back track to the menu...
NO KID's MENU?
No mac and cheese?
No fries?
No cornbread?
No green beans?
No salad?


The good
Turkey was moist and had a good flavor, would have been excellent if warm.
Husband said brisket was really really good, but cold.

The bad
-Sause sucks, worse sauce I ever tasted. Like water and pepper. They have 2 sauces and both taste the same. One has a ton of pepper, the other has more.
-Potato salad, really is potato salad so difficult?
-Corn was soggy and had no flavor.
-Red potatoes (called NEW POTATOES here) are water logged gross.


The ugly
-Napkins on the other side of the restaurant in a dispenser on the wall (bathroom 3-fold paper towel dispenser).
-STYROFOAM- THE DEVIL OF THE PLANET.


One star for the country store greeting gal.
One star for the turkey.

I'll be back for the turkey and a soda, skip the sides and bring my own sauce."}
{"text":"Love the brisket, ribs and being able to buy by the LB.

I recommend this laid back atmosphere for some good BBQ."}
{"text":"Was as I expected it, not bad by any means but did not leave me strongly desiring a return trip. Fair value and good overall appearance/cleanliness etc. Just not raving about it."}
{"text":"Always a great meal, fast and tasty indoor or outdoor seating. Easy way to eat paleo if that's your meal choice as no meat has sauce on it when you order. 

Come and bring the family or just yourself. I enjoyed the jalape√±o sausage."}
{"text":"Wow, I was in the VIP section of the BBQ and Beer festival that happened two weeks ago in Chandler and Rudy's was being served in that area. I had never experienced their BBQ before since they are very far from both downtown Tempe where I live and downtown Phoenix where I work. I am so glad that I was Blessed to experience their food finally. WOW, the tender and delectable beef brisket blew my hair back in a good way. The pulled pork was equally delectable and the potato side and coleslaw were out of this world. The staff that were working the event were awesome as well. I must say that the beans were disgusting, but everything else made my taste buds do a little dance!

Cheers"}
{"text":"They made me like beef brisket. Not just like, but savor it, love it! That alone earned them four stars. The fifth star is because of their PHENOMENALLY friendly service. From before I even walked in they were helpful in holding the door for me (Tip: once you walk in, walk straight to the back of the store to order if you are dining in). They gave me the full run down of the place and how to order. 
I had a half dozen free samples, and eventually ordered the spicy chopped beef sandwich, .5lb of burnt ends (lean brisket with the INCREDIBLY good crispy bits on the end. Not on the menu, but they took care of me), a medium Dr. Pepper, and a side of Rudy's beans. They use Holsum brand bread and offer unlimited white or wheat bread. The total was $17 and change.
The sandwich was the best BBQ sandwich I've ever had. It's hard to explain in writing how incredible it was. First, there was a lot of it. Second, it set off every flavor receptor in my mouth without overwhelming them. By that I mean it wasn't too spicy, and I believe it's flavored so anyone could enjoy it no matter what their taste preferences. It needed no toppings or sauces.
I started out this review talking about the brisket for a reason. Incredible as the spicy chopped pork sandwich was, the lean burnt ends were better. They tore apart perfectly, had almost zero fat, and the fat they did have HELPED rather than hurt the meat by adding an extra punch of flavor without being greasy or chunky. They were moist enough to not need sauce though they did offer two types which I didn't try. I didn't want to spoil the perfection.
The beans I didn't like. I tried two bites, then threw them out. I was expecting something more like Bush's baked beans.
The bean issue aside, my experience here was incredible and I will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"We drove from Tempe for lunch with co-workers, we loved the food. Though its not the best BBQ place like the one's in Texas, it deserves better comparing to similar restaurants in Phoenix area. Their sauce is best & food was well done. Got a pound of chicken, new potato with butter for sides. The backyard kind of ambiance is really nice."}
{"text":"Went to Rudy's Saturday night and was really disappointed.  Ordered baby backs at 7:30 and they only had 4.  Said it would be 30 MINUTES before they had more.  Really, out of ribs at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  Might have been a blessing in disguise as they were TOUGH and minimal meat...did order 2 pork ribs and they were pretty good.  Otherwise, very disappointed in the food...."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, great barb-Q, until yesterday. Have food poisoning after eating the baby back ribs yesterday. Purchased around 7pm. Be careful."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good smoked BBQ place, this is the place for you! I didn't like the BBQ sauce to much but the brisket and baby back ribs were great! Also try the fully loaded potato with cheese and brisket!! The cream of corn here was above and beyond!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a traditional country restaurant this is it. Once you walk in you know it's not a typical restaurant with the picnic table set up and the way they serve your food. I recommend rudys to anyone who likes BBQ and a country atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very disappointed...heard lots of good things and always saw a long line.....food was just not that good in my opinion.  Did not live up to hype."}
{"text":"Great moist brisket! Awesome red potatoes, and southern style peach cobbler!"}
{"text":"I first had Rudy's in San Antonio, Texas while visiting my husband.  It was the best barbeque I had ever had.  When they opened up the one in Chandler, my husband and I were overjoyed.  We stop by every time we go through Chandler.  We live in Tucson, so it is a treat for us.  And it is right off of I-10.  
The people there are very courteous.  They are also extremely helpful.  The place is always clean, and they work really fast.  I am never dissatisfied when we visit.  It isn't as interactive as the San Antonio ones, but it works for the people out here.  I love it...
My husband loves the moist brisket and beans.  I love the spicy chop.  My kids love the chicken.  And, my brother said the ribs are awesome.  We always grab some Rudy's sauce to bring home with us.  We don't get the sissy sauce like people we know.  A plus is that the sauce doesn't kill my stomach like most barbeque sauces."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The brisket is so good!  I love all their sides. It's hard to only pick a few!  The wait can get pretty long, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back and get another sausage sandwich.  I had the regular,  my wife got the brisket sandwich. Both were great and full of flavor,  and the potato salad was great.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Rudy's. Anytime I'm down in Chandler I make sure I stop by. The baby back ribs & the moist brisket are my favorites with sissy sause."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the 1st time...and the line was long.  Was briefed by the server...p/u your sides...pick your meat...tell them how much weight of meat you want...also get unlimited slices of bread (white/wheat).  Boom you got your meal.  So I figured...instead of getting the sandwich...I can just make my own with the bread they gave me.   Liked how they weighed all the meat before you.  1/2lb of brisket didn't seem like a lot in my basket...but seemed liked what everybody was getting in around me. So figured that was enough and if you eat it with their bread it'll fill you up.  Lean Brisket taste good...sauce was good...nothing that wowed me.  Wouldn't drive out of my way to get here.  Average BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way out of Phoenix, I couldn't help myself ordering a bit of everything because everything looked and smelled so good.  Not to mention them giving you samples of everything gets you hooked!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the state,    amazing Brisket and try the Prime Rib if you never had it.  I have been to Rudy's in New Mexico and a few locations in Austin, TX home to some great BBQ and this location holds it own.   I just wish they had more locations and centrally located -  its a far drive to the last exit (Chandler Blvd) on the way to Tucson before you hit the Gila River Reservation.    Please put one in Scottsdale or North Phoenix or Mesa ,  or all of the above.    Thanks,  BBQ lover"}
{"text":"This may be the worst BBQ I have even had and I grew up on Memphis where it's a staple. I had a turkey sandwich and a brisket sandwich. They were not much bigger than a McDonald's cheeseburger. The turkey was ok but the brisket was just plain nasty. The only flavor I tasted was smoke, smoke and make smoke. Hair terrible. Maybe it was a bad day who knows"}
{"text":"Food wasn't too savory.  The service, however was great.  They don't offer spicy sauce options.  Too me the food was sort of bland."}
{"text":"I love Rudy's barbecue. The food, that sauce they call BBQ sauce( they should rename it cuz its way better than others I've had), and especially the good prices. Only reason im not givin it 5 stars is the cash register lady had a huuuuge attitude when we were ordering our meats. She was acting as if I was troubling her by asking for food. I've been to other ones in texas where they don't mind talking to you. Yes I ordered a lot of food bc we had a huge appetite but I didnt appreciate her derogatory tone when she said \"is that enough food for you now?\" and no, she wasnt being sarcastic. Not even a smile or smirk after. I mean wow, do you want me to come behind the cash register and get my own meat if it's too troubling for you to turn around and get the meat I ordered? I love Rudy's but It's hard to see myself coming back if i get treated poorly for ordering food"}
{"text":"Wife and son took me here for my birthday.  We were excited based on the reviews but were let down.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either...kind of mediocre in our book.  We had the moist brisket, baby back ribs, and jalepeno sausage, along with small beans, cream corn, potato salad, baked potato, and finally a little cobbler.  Standouts were the cream corn, baked potato, and cobbler.  We'd give the ribs 4 of 5, but the brisket, sausage, beans, and potato salad were just okay.  Brisket tasted of artificial smoke that was over powering.  The jalepeno sausage was good but no jalepeno flavor and no spice.  The beans and potato salad were just blah.  Neat environment and friendly service."}
{"text":"Oh.My.Gawd.  Amazing. Food gets 5 stars only because that's the highest number. The best bbq sandwich I've ever eaten.  The Chopped Sauce.  It's brisket, pulled like pulled pork, and mixed with Rudy's signature sauce, served on a lightly toasted fresh bun. All I added was a little mayo and I was in food heaven. What this place lacks in ambiance is made up for by the food. Lots of noisy brats, my pet peeve in any restaurant setting, but get the food to go.  Can't rave enough on the wonderful tender meats in this place. Go. Just get in the car, start it up, and go. Now."}
{"text":"I walked in as a first time guest. I heard it's great in Texas, knowing we had one here. I was very disappointed they just basically throw your food on wax paper as if you where in a prison and their you go. Honestly not the best and over priced for very little effort put into it. I would not go back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Food was ok, I had the brisket.  I think what my problem was that I was standing in line like I was in a school cafeteria and I got my meat served on wax paper. Guess I expected a little more or at least a plate."}
{"text":"Rudy's originated in Austin, TX and having been in Texas for the past 14 years, it has become one of my staples. Moving to AZ only a few months ago, I was beyond surprised and excited to know that there is a Rudy's nearby. Can't beat it. Born and raised in the South, I've craved good southern BBQ since I've moved here and we hit up Rudy's every time we are in the Valley."}
{"text":"Good BBQ but not great. Why doesit taste different than the Rudy's in Texas?  

This place is still ok.  If they could find someone to fix their problem, I would come back regularly.  Hope that they find someone that knows how to BBQ."}
{"text":"Great barbque and a very fun restaurant setup. Their catering is great as well. Good breakfast tacos."}
{"text":"Rudy's is not the \"typical\" BBQ that most of us are used to, it's Texas style which can be very surprising to people if you haven't had it before or if you aren't expecting it. Texas style has almost no sweetness in the sauce or dry rub; it is more of a salty, tangy, spicy flavor. With that in mind, it is very good! The turkey is surprisingly fantastic and the brisket and pork are very good.

Rudy's is a fun place to visit and enjoy some really good food, just be prepared that it might not be what you are used to."}
{"text":"Ate there twice.Food is ok..brisket is dry and tough..pulled pork is fair. The staff preparing the food yell out the orders is annoying.i cant see ever going back..good luck..and Bon-appetite"}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price and terrific customer service. I didn't really like the table setup and that's my only complaint about the place. But that can be overlooked if you want some tasty BBQ and nice friendly service. Go Enjoy Rudy's!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe my eyes as I was meeting some colleagues at their hotel before going to a client meeting. There was a sign that said Rudy's and a building that looked just like one in Austin. Living in Boston, we don't have real barbecue, and a real Rudy's would be great.

After the meeting and before heading to the airport I was happy to find out this is the same Rudy's. It was great. The killer was the moist brisket. It was almost sinful. It was juicy, had a good bark, and was not fatty (a difficult mix). The regular brisket was just as good -- it had more of a bark and was still moist. The ribs had an ton of flavor.

If I had to choose, I'd just go for the brisket. They were both insane. And forget the mild sauce; the regular sauce was barely spicy.

If I'm in Austin, it's not Franklins or the Iron Works. In AZ, it's a 5 star."}
{"text":"Tried this place the other day, wasn't too bad but wasn't great, I decided to come here due to all the great reviews but the food was just okay. Although pricing was great and had a great food selection, everything was just average. I also didn't really care for their Tangy BBQ sauce and their corn on the cob wasn't crisp or sweet enough for me."}
{"text":"Pick a meat, or lots of meat. Great concept. Order what you want, ribs, brisket, sausage, turkey, chicken. Had a little of a lot and liked it. Glad to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I gave it 5 stars because I have to follow a gluten/dairy/soy free diet due to food allergies and Rudy's has items on their menu that fit my diet.  The manager gave me a list of the items on the menu that contained gluten.  I found that to be very helful.  I love the brisket!"}
{"text":"The bbq is great and we stop here to eat here in every city we visit that has one.  I've tried the turkey, brisket, shredded pork and jalape√±o sausage.  All deliciously moist and just the right amount of smokiness.  I wish they made their own macaroni and potato salad instead of the package stuff they serve.  Probably doesn't matter since I always get so full from the bbq!"}
{"text":"Cool/chill atmosphere. Enjoyed the outside patio area. The line was long, but wasnt too bad. what do you expect? They are a newbie here :) you better go try it for yourself!

Try the brisket moist! And the cream corn! Yums!!! I also liked the jalape√±o sausage and pulled pork. 

Will def be back to try more on the menu..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Moist Brisket, Half Chicken and Whole Regular Sausage Link. Awesome!!

Flavors are there and just simply cooked to perfection! 

Great place for BBQ!"}
{"text":"What a letdown!  I'm a HUGE fan of Rudy's in the Austin area.  So much so that I've hand-carried 3lbs of Moist Brisket on a 4hr flight home to the Northwest.  
However, at this location in Chandler, AZ, the Moist was more like brisket jerky.  I was sooooo disappointed :(
Sausage and Cream Corn were the saving grace of the meal though!"}
{"text":"The moist beef brisket is very very good.  I would give it a 5 but the sides are ok."}
{"text":"Our favorite weekend breakfast spot. We take our pup and hang outside and enjoy some of the yummy burritos. The staff is always very friendly and kind! Peter is always sure to say hi and make sure our experience is fantastic! We like the egg, cheese and potato burritos, but you can't go wrong. The creamed corn makes a great side!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat in AZ. The peach cobbler just tops it off!"}
{"text":"Texas BBQ. Yes, PLEASE!

I'm a born and raised Texan, and Rudy's was my favorite BBQ quick stop when I lived there.  I missed good BBQ when I moved to Phoenix.

Even though I live on the west side of town, we are always willing to drive 45 minutes to this location to get some create your own breakfast tacos from Rudy's.  We even purchase extra tacos to take home for breakfast the next morning :)

The sandwiches and potato salad are also fantastic.  As a last reminder: don't skip out on dessert!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large group of people and it was great. Food is tasty and I love the decor. A little pricey but it's worth it for some good BBQ. It was super busy so we waited a while in the line, but that may be because this is a new restaurant. Overall we had a good experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"Please do not confuse this place with a traditional restaurant or traditional BBQ.  You stand in line to get your food, service is slow,  everything is a la carte and a bit spendy when it is all said and done.  The only thing included is bread, if you want to call it that or have it.  Usually one expects good rolls or some such thing for bread in a restaurant, but here they just reach into a plastic wrapped loaf of cheap sandwich bread and hand you a stack of slices.  I think the meat came piled on a paper plate.  The sauce was on the table they said. You are left to find your own place to sit among the big long picnic tables.  You will dine with strangers if it is busy.   Expecting normal BBQ sauce, at a BBQ restaurant I opened the bottle and poured some sauce on my meat.  I about gagged when I tasted it.  It tastes like Heinz 57 steak sauce and that is nothing like BBQ sauce.  Thank god the napkins were also dispensed at the table so I could have all I wanted to try to clean it off of my meat.  I do not go to a BBQ joint to eat plain meat, but fortunately this meat was OK by itself, because the sauce was terrible and there was nothing else to eat with it.  If I recall they did not even have fries.  This is just not my idea of BBQ I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Ribs were juicy but too much of a peppery flavor! I like my meats with a more smokey flavor! Prefer the can't stop smoking ribs much better! I do love the sweet tea! Best around!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a colleague from Albuquerque who is a real foodie. He said it is real BBQ and being from Ireland, this was something I had yet to really experience it turns out. 

As I approached the counter the guy behind asked if I had been there before, When I said I hadn't he proceeded to get me some samples of their yummified meats and holy crap did it provide a problem. It was all frickin delicious! I eventually decided to get some turkey, sausage and brisket ( I was very hungry and just out of the gym). 

I like the way they put the food in an old country store style plastic basket (the kind fruit and veg gets delivered to small shops in), and you pay by weight!

I got my stuff pretty fast and sat down at one of their \"feeding benches\":). I grabbed some greaseproof paper to eat on and proceeded to stuff my face with the finest smoked meats i have ever eaten! The brisket was unreal, Turkey was better than anything I've ever had but the real winner here was the humble sausage! Whatever spices they use only compliments the obvious high quality meat used, a fact emphasised by the way the sausage is cut and presented, sliced lengthways in half so nothing nasty can hide! 

All of this was accompanied by the fittingly unreal BBQ sauce which comes in regular and sissy sauce! Both are equally good and I'll be taking a bottle back to good ole Eire with me! 

After I finished I dumped my trash and washed my hand at the huge trough on the wall. No fuss or bs here, order, enjoy, clean up and leave!

The whole experience left me wanting more and excited at the prospect of my next two weeks getting in here as much as possible! I really enjoy the simplicity of the whole thing: smoked meats which are as close to a butchers counter as you can get, pay by weight, complimentary slices of bread with spicy chop w/sauuuuuse, and eating with my hands ( optional, they do provide plastic cutlery)! 


Note, not for anyone who is looking for a fancy sit down meal or doesn't like real honest food! 

I've been here a number of times since and I have tried most of the stuff on the menu and never been disappointed. Also everyone behind the counter seems to be the same level of very friendly, no bad experiences here!

5 stars only because there isn't anymore!!"}
{"text":"Always wonderful!!!! Customer service is the best and breakfast is the perfect time to stop in."}
{"text":"Awesome, first time here and had to come back the next day. 
The green chile stew alone gets this place five stars. Unexpected, but this is one of the best soups/stews I have ever had in my life. It was kind of like a thicker posole. Throw some of their pulled pork in to take it to an even higher level. Gonna miss that back in NY. 
The BBQ meats are all fantastic as well, my favorites were the lean brisket, the pulled pork, and the baby back ribs. Was surprised to find the lean brisket to be more flavorful than the moist brisket. Great smoke ring. 
Very friendly staff, fun environment that isn't too smokey. Appreciated that I didn't spend the rest of the day smelling like smoke. Some people might like that though. 
Anyway, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried Rudy's for the first time tonight. Food was good, not great, and we weren't impressed with the \"share-a-table-with-your-neighor\" atmosphere.  Eating with no plates was a bit odd as was the single slice of plain sandwich bread we received with all the meat we ordered. We aren't barbecue connesuers, though, so maybe this is normal? We'll definitely opt for other BBQ restaurants before returning here."}
{"text":"Rudys, oh Rudys.....how for art thou Rudys. So glad Rudys is here. Used to go to Rudys in Albuquerque when I lived in Santa Fe. Moist Brisket, sliced, on a piece of white bread, topped with sissy sause and jalapenos and pickles. Is there anything better? I say Nay!
Not that there isn't any other good bbq places in town, there are plenty, but, this is a pulled pork city. And, I am a sliced brisket man. 
One knock on Rudys is that you have to eat-in, the taste and texture of the meat changes dramatically when travelling, even a short distance. Had Rudys for an event at work and it wasn't quite the same, good, but not great like when you eat at the store. 
Still.....there is no denying that when it comes to barbecue, Rudys is the one for me.
Oh yeah, and the banana pudding with the nilla cookies, oh yeah!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place (and I'm really picky)!
Helpful staff if you're not sure which route to go"}
{"text":"Amazing service every time we go. Food is great, and the \"sissy sauce\" is perfect for my sister who can't handle the heat. And they always give generous to go portions."}
{"text":"I have a mixed review.  We waited in the very long line during their grand opening, and were disappointed in the taste and quality of the food.  My ribs had a fishy taste, and the brisket was dry. 
 
Several months later, we gave them another shot.  We ordered baby back ribs, smoked pork loin, and the moist brisket.  All three were very tasty and moist.  The hotter BBQ sauce has a kick, but complemented all three meats very well.  We will definitely be back.  Oh, BTW, the creamed corn is fantastic."}
{"text":"I love the food here! They gave us samples became it was our first time here which was great. I had a jumbo smoked potato with brisket. It's huge and so delicious. The brisket has fabulous smoke flavor and a good visible smoke line. The sauce is very good but the meat doesn't need it. Be sure to try the green chili stew."}
{"text":"I've been to Rudy's several times in the past year or so, and I've decided today will be the last time because this place really is nothing more than the Applebee's of BBQ. The food is mass produced garbage. The sides just aren't very good; they taste like they've been shipped from a warehouse. Normally, the brisket is good but rarely is it ever spectacular. The past four times, it's been especially bad.  Today the \"moist\" brisket was so dry that it is nearly inedible. It's texture was more like over-cooked roast beef than it was BBQ. I had to drown it in sauce to give it any kind of moisture. Most Texans will tell you that if brisket is done right you don't need any sauce. The meat should speak for itself, and today, the meat said, \"You really should eat elsewhere.\" And then, there's the pulled pork... It's just horrible. It's really a shame that they try to pass that off as BBQ. You would get laughed out of North Carolina with pulled pork like that."}
{"text":"Wow. I was cautious at first as I'm not the type of person to eat BBQ style food. But...WOW. Every meat is so tender. SO tasty. I not a fan of pork, but ah, at this place I am.  Everyone should experience it. Let the person that takes your order know it's your first time and they will explain everything to you as well as grab you a bunch of samples. I was able to make my choice with a breeze. Non traditional ordering. It's fantastic. Best I've ever had. I came because people couldn't stop raving about it. I now see why! YUM."}
{"text":"Just to be clear, my previous review emphasizes the quality of the breakfast tacos that Rudy's serves. There can be only one five-star barbecue in the valley, and I don't want anyone to think that I am throwing around five stars to just anyone. Having said that, the only thing that stops me from hitting Rudy's for breakfast 4-5 days a week is that they stop serving breakfast at 10:00 am and I don't feel like fighting traffic back into downtown on the 10 on weekdays - their breakfast tacos are that good! (At one time there was a Rudy's location in North Texas that served breakfast tacos anytime the restaurant was open, so here's hoping for that change in the future!)"}
{"text":"I don't know much about Texas BBQ, but I am from the Southeast and I do know a little something about BBQ in general.  I love Rudy's BBQ.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I haven't tried everything on the menu.  So far, the only thing I've had is the sausage sandwich, which I can't seem to get past, because it is so darn good.  My husband on the other hand, has tried several of their items and loves them all.  Besides, any place that serves sweet tea is alright on my list of places; I haven't had sweet tea this good since I left SC.  We currently live in East Chandler, not far from Joe's Real BBQ and I prefer Rudy's over them hands down."}
{"text":"It's a line up and order place. Sooo good!! They give you good size portions for samples at the register. It definitely made me switch my order to their turkey! It was so moist. My boyfriend had their pulled pork sandwich and said it was the so sweet and the most delicious he's ever had! Will come here again! Amazing food and friendly service"}
{"text":"Been there twice... the food is disgusting. Literally tastes like the McDonald's of BBQ. I will never go back."}
{"text":"By far the best beef brisket I have ever had. The turkey was also good but hands down the brisket was the best they offer in my opinion. I also tried their green chile stew and it was outstanding. If you are in the area I recommend you try this place. Very inexpensive we were a party of seven and walked out with a tab under $60.00"}
{"text":"Bomb bbq and I am from the south. Had the wet and  lean brisket. Bark was phenomenal and the non-sissy sauce is the way to go. Sweet tea to wash it all down. Put me in coach, I'm ready to play.."}
{"text":"I have gone back and forth with this review because I wanted to make it as honest as I can with a review people can find helpful.. The people working there are really nice and helpful. My gf got a turkey sandwich and I got a pulled pork. Both were very good meals and worth the price. Drinks were a bit pricy and the only side we got was corn on cob. The corn of cob wasn't very good at all. It was mushy and way over cooked. We did ask for butter and she put a ton of butter which didn't help the corn at all. I would give the sandwiches a 4.5 on the stars but the pricing on the drinks and corn of cob 1 star which I believe would take it to 3 stars"}
{"text":"If you're even the slightest OCD, you wouldn't like it here. No plates in sight and open cafeteria seating that screams \"lack of sanitation!\" I like the family friendly atmosphere and decor, but the 50 foot long tables in the center of the room made me fearful that is have to sit with a family I didn't know (thankful though that there was family sitting close who taught me how to use the bottle opener on the wall). The food was ok...I had pork ribs that were actually good and tender. Brisket was dry with hardly any flavor; thank goodness for BBQ sauce. The beans tasted like they were cooked in the can over an open flame and the baked potato left much to be desired; seemed to be missing something. Our cashier, Sergio, was great though. Patient, kind, and tolerated our constant changes while we ordered. Another staff, who I assumed was a manager, was main round and being helpful which is always nice! It was a new experience, but for this place, one time is enough."}
{"text":"Rudy's never disappoints! Breakfast, lunch or dinner it's always good! Peach cobbler is a must have!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to get some cream corn...mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"You absolutely have to try the moist brisket...unbelievable. I order mine \" with bark and fat\" totally amazing and flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is great! I feel like I'm at home and the BBQ is amazing! My favorite is the moist brisket! Must try if you like home style bbq"}
{"text":"First time here with my family. 

Free Wifi, awesome smell of the pit, plenty of seating area, and reasonably priced. 

Our issues are as follows..
Food has no flavor
No kids menu for picky kids, except when the cashier finally told us off the menu is grilled cheese sandwich. Every time we asked a question about the menu i.e. Do you have cornbread? No! Do you have fries? No! I'm very surprised for a BBQ establishment no cornbread nor fries (potato wedges) are on the menu
BBQ Sause has too much vinegar

We will not be back again."}
{"text":"I've been going through a BBQ fixation lately and this place answers that call perfectly.  I went to a couple other places recently then started visiting here after not coming for about a year. It was time for a lunch visit today again!  I very likely will stick with this place like religion for the near future! The smokey flavor will stick to your mouth...forever! Brisket in bulk and some solid sauces makes for a happy John...and if you are a \"brisketarian\" like I am,  make sure to check out Rudy's!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Love that they allow you to sample any meat before purchasing. Their creamed corn is delicious. Wish they had a better bread selection like fresh biscuits :-))"}
{"text":"Brisket is good. 
I just don't like the beans or Cole slaw here. Even though I am a huge Cole slaw and bean eater. The BQ sauce here I actually do not like. The cheapy Kraft BQ sauce at the store is better than here. It seems to have to much vinegar in it. The bottles to dispense the BQ sauce are hard to deal with. It's like they don't want you to use their sauce. Maybe that's a good thing. I was in the area and thought I would try it again. But to no surprise still the same. 
All the meats are really great but the sauce and extras just don't set the tone for me.
 I couldn't eat the beans. The BQ sauce has now upset the stomach. I know a lot of people like many things here but it doesn't cut the mustard with me or rather the sauce."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ found this place by accident. Very friendly staff ribs were the best I've had in years."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  It has anything you want .  And the breakfast tacos Rock.  I love the vibe of this place and the family style seating."}
{"text":"Been driving past this nice looking spot forever and knew I had to try it.  Since I love BBQ, the thing is everyone can taste the same BBQ and the range of reviews you would get well is as different as the styles you get from city to city.  Being I have tried BBQ in South Caroline, Memphis TN, Dallas TX, Kansas City...you get the point, so it's pretty hard to give a fair review when the range is that wide.  

The set up was interesting, like a lunch line with huge tubs to hold drinks in ice leading to the counter, and afterwards you head towards the picnic table cloths laid out on long bench tables.

There's a fridge holding cold sides and deserts just before the counter, so we grabbed potato salad and slaw, and pecan pie.  Ordered moist brisket, and baby back ribs, with beans.  (note: tell em it's your first time to get a little sample! we sampled the turkey, it was actually very moist).

My thing also about potato salad is everyone has a mixed pallet when it comes to this as well.  I normally hesitate when I see pre made potato salad sitting in a fridge because i immediately think of the Reisers brand that comes in those huge tubs at the grocery store, and those are pretty terrible!  But it was a little better than expected so that was a surprise.  

The moist brisket was the start of the night, and the ribs were very disappointing.  The ribs were dry and the meat looked like it shrunk down more than it should have, and since they sell meat by weight here, i'm sure we didn't get our money's worth on the ribs.  The sissy sauce and the regular were ok, I honestly could not tell the difference between the two, they tasted the same!

Overall it was an okay experience,  I do intend to come back and try other items, the night we came a lady was standing outside with a pet GOAT on a leash!  So I figured we were in for some real county BBQ!"}
{"text":"Gotta say, still the best. First time I tasted Rudy's BBQ was in the late 70's in San Antonio, TX. Didn't think bringing it to Arizona would taste the same (being Chef's are different). But the taste is still ridiculous good. I have been to Memphis, etc. and I am still and always will be a fan of Rudy's. Thank you for bringing your wonderful taste to AZ. I will always be your fan. Now I just drive on freeway, whereas in San Antonio, I remember driving the back roads to get to your restaurant."}
{"text":"I moved to San Antonio in 1989, the same year Rudy's 
Country Store added BarBQ to their grocery store. There was no inside seating and no air-conditioning. You sat outdoors next to the fire and usually smelled like wood smoke when you left. Soon there were lines out the open-air counter and ranch hands and dentists stood in line with all the other lovers of fine Texas BarBQ. I thought I had died and gone to heaven when Steve Freidkin, owner of TexAz Grill told me (at the Robert Earl Keen concert) Phoenix had a Rudy's. I was in line the next day for lunch! Almost everything felt like home and many others thought so too. The line snaked thru the restaurant and out the door. Just like home. I give it a 99%, the only concern was that the brisket tasted like it had been cooked in a new pit--WHICH IT HAD!  Takes time to season the pit with lots of good wood and smoke from the meat to produce the right flavor. But, its pretty dang close!  Closest thing to authentic anywhere in AZ."}
{"text":"Good Texas style Barbecue. I personally prefer their lean Brisket, but all of their meats are excellent in quality, The best thing on their menu though is the cream corn, it is the best I have ever had in my life. I will say that it is NOT your granddad's creamed corn, it is a new concept that is fresh and amazingly delicious. Do your taste buds a favor and eat at this restaurant.They also have great breakfast tacos if you are looking for an option for breakfast."}
{"text":"Just OK.  But like pizza and sex, there really is no bad BBQ.  
I think there is something lost in translation from its Texas roots to AZ.  Gone is the appeal of the gas station dive.  Atmosphere feels a little phony in a pretty, new building.  The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces.  The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying true... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette.  The sauces seem a little amateur.  I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard.  If a true amateur (me) can evolve into better sauces, so can Rudys.  Now I need to stop at the new BBQ joint next door to see which one will get my BBQ dollars... stay tuned."}
{"text":"The best!!!!  The original Rudy's in Leon Springs, TX is 6 stars.  No place I've eaten at in AZ comes even to Rudy's.  Go to Rudy's and get happy."}
{"text":"Good but not great, tried Can't Stop Smokin across the street, that was a little better."}
{"text":"After living in the center of the bbq universe, this place offers a decent diversion, but is far from extraordinary.  Pretty high-priced, and the food is just ok.  I look forward to trying out some of the other bbq options the Valley has to offer."}
{"text":"First time last night. I loved the BBQ sauce. The lack of cleanliness & no plates turned me off.  The restaurant needs to train its employees to clean with a disinfectant between customer on the tables, especially since no plates are used. I did love their sauce and will give them another try."}
{"text":"Fast service, food was good, especially the moist brisket. They don't have traditional sides like Mac n cheese or corn bread. The serving trays are about as cumbersome as carrying around an oil derrick. Oh and there weren't any napkins readily available."}
{"text":"I'm admittedly a BBQ snob.  This spot is average.  Didn't like the sauces they have, but the moist brisket was alright."}
{"text":"As much as I hate chain restaurants, this place is amazing. This is without question one of the best places to get barbecue in the valley.

The food is amazing. The brisket is moist and barbecued to perfection. The pulled pork it's not stringy and dried out. The sausages, forget about it. This place is amazing. On top of all of that, you have the atmosphere. Proper customer service will make a restaurant go a long ways.  I have never been treated poorly or rudely there. I recommend Rudy's to anyone who is asking for a good place to have barbecue. Of course that is if they can't make it to my place. ;-)"}
{"text":"My selection of moist brisket was delicious, overall satisfied with the taste, bit the idea of buying everything a la carte cost $ 17.00. Now for the downside,  the meat is weighed and even though I purchased the higher priced brisket, I paid for a lot of fat. 

The idea of eating on picnic tables, not to fond of, ending taking out and eating in my room."}
{"text":"Overall the food and experience was very one note, all the meats tasted the same, smoked.  I stared at my dinner on a sheet of wax paper while I sat on a wooden picnic table and wondered if i was out to eat, or at a cafeteria for blissfully unaware refugees.  Not for the refined palate, no clear \"order here\" placement, your meat is weighed on a scale in front of you and placed on wax paper in a big plastic crate, no plates to eat off of, plastic utensils, and the \"barbecue sauce\" tastes like tomatoes paste mixed with sugar and a TON of pepper, try next door instead, maybe they use plates and silverware. 1 star for the potatoes salad... and that's being polite."}
{"text":"I had Rudy's on Friday Oct 6, 2017. The service was excellent but the food was not up to par from the first time I visited them when they first open. I got 1/2 lb baby backs , smoked baked potato &  sausage. The ribs use to be very tender this time they were tough, baked potato was under cooked. I have heard from friends that ate there that they have the same problem. The place is clean and neat, the  personnel are always friendly. But the food is not up to standard. Service may be great but the food is what took me there."}
{"text":"Excellent for real bbq. Never finish it all every time we go. Great food and portions."}
{"text":"This is my new \"go-to\" place for lunch. The baby back ribs are awesome (every time I have them, I really am in awe of the people who smoked them) the sides are great and, most importantly, consistently tasty. Oh I have to mention that I just love the deserts, especially the banana pudding."}
{"text":"The Applebees  of BBQ, everything is just ok, you won't be disappointed nor will you have your mind blown. If you are looking for that kind of experience with BBQ. Head over to Little Miss BBQ. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Its pricey, but oh so yummy.  My only suggestion is that they should offer more than just white/wheat bread when buying meats by the pound. But the meats, all of them, are oh so good! Try the turkey!"}
{"text":"This is some darn good BBQ.  The breakfast tacos are so good!  Also, they have 3 choices of briskets and I definitely recommend every one of them.  The turkey was also fantastic.  I wasn't as impressed with the spare ribs because they seemed way too peppery.  Tell them it's your first time in and they will let you try most anything.  Unfortunately, there was a 30+ minute wait from the time of getting in line to getting food.  I did it once but I won't be doing it again.  Once the new appeal diminishes, it should be a good lunch place."}
{"text":"Well done BBQ. Cool setting. Nice service at the counters and happily offered samples. Good value. Clean!"}
{"text":"Best Briskets I've ever had. Not crazy about the choices of side dishes, though."}
{"text":"The lean brisket is some of the best I've ever had, really good and I didn't have to spend any time cutting away or eating around the fat. 
Rudy's beans are very tasty, love the flavor and spice. Just enough to leave a little burn but not too hot. 
My son was not a fan of the baby back ribs. Cole slaw is OK,  not anything to write home about but nobody goes to a BBQ joint just for the cole slaw. 
All together, we liked the food and will definitely be back the next time we are in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My restaurant experience just doesn't jive with eating off tables in a loud corralled environment. Yes, the food was decent, even tasty, but something about it being slopped onto wax paper takes away from the taste."}
{"text":"Dining area is nice and inviting.  The ribs and the brisket are not so good, brisket tastes bland as well as the ribs that are chewy.  I have tasted a better Texas BBQ."}
{"text":"Fell in love with Rudy's when visiting Austin Texas a few years ago. We were so happy when they opened this Rudy's in Chandler. We live in the West Valley so it's over an hour to get there, but we get our \"Rudy's fix\" every so often. 
The Smoked turkey it heavenly, love the brisket & jalape√±o sausage   For sides we go for the beans and potato salad. The cold slaw is good also but we run out of room:). 

Hear they have plans to open a store in Goodyear or Avondale next year. That would be super!!!"}
{"text":"Rudy's is great! They have great prices and amazing food. 

The Brisket, Green Chili Stew, Breakfast Burritos, and \"Sause\" are what I love most. You won't regret trying this place and it's clean too."}
{"text":"So, I had the Hotlink Sandwich It had real good flavor not Spicy thou, But good flavor. I wish it was hotter in both the Spicy and the temperature of the Meat it was room temperature you would think it would be warm or at less the BBQ sauce would have been warm. They had a couple different kinds if BBQ sauces witch was nice unfortunately I wasn't a fan of either one.The atmosphere was real nice real layed back long tables like you sitting and a family picnic was nice different I liked it. Over all I'll go back again"}
{"text":"I have been to Rudy's in Austin,Texas.  It is very good. can't wait to get to the one in Chandler."}
{"text":"Took the family and had their lean brisket and their turkey for lunch today. I really liked both, but the turkey was really great!"}
{"text":"Best baby back ribs and beans I've ever had!  Meat falls off the bone - so tender.  The spicy chop is also very flavorful.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Met a friend there for lunch. Didn't really know what to expect. Hadn't had bbq in a while. Was pleasantly surprised. Very good food. I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I love Rudy's!  We had them cater a party we had over the weekend and it was a huge hit.  Everyone particularly loved the brisket.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you like smoked Brisket do not order the tender cut version of their brisket. While it was tender there was no smoke ring and the meat was bland. Everything else I had was spot on.  I thought they offered a nice variety and it was priced pretty fairly."}
{"text":"The meats are always so dry no matter what we order or what time of day. The peach cobbler is really good though. And why don't they have mac'n'cheese?"}
{"text":"This was my ifrst experience with Rudy's and it was pretty good. My partner and I decided to go for lunch on Weds. We had prepared ourselves for the wait we had read about in the reviews but we were very happy when we arrived because there wasnt one. 
We moved here from the south (Arkansas) and are always looking for some \"down home\" cooking. I am a fan of Memphis style BBQ so I wasn't too fond of their sauces. We ordered 1/2 lb of brisket, pulled pork, and Baby Backs...corn on the cob, cream corn, potatoe salad, and beans. The brisket and baby backs were amazing but the pulled pork had too much pepper. All the sides were good except the beans...bland. My partner loved her cream corn. I like the way they serve you and I had to chuckle when i seen the white bread...brought back memories. Overall, we had good \"down home\" food at a fair price. We will return:)"}
{"text":"ReDONKulous BBQ and atmosphere...all u could want in a traditional BBQ restaurant...worth the extra 30-40 min to get    There"}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich and it had no flavor and was dry. Needed to douse the meat in their bbq sauce to get a taste. I also tried the banana pudding and it was nothing special. The cashier seemed annoyed when we asked for samples since we had never been there before. The only thing I enjoyed is the a la cartel ordering style."}
{"text":"I always leave happy, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the limited menu. I really wish there were a few more options and I end up getting the same items every time (baker moist, cobbler and creamed corn).  That being said, the food is delicious, high quality and a good value."}
{"text":"The wife (The Sinaloence) and I are struggling to find the way to review this establishment. At first, like others, we were of a mixed mind and spirit, but on careful analysis our conclusions solidified. Oh, and forgive me for the length of the review.
. 
The restaurant environment is fine. It's the good 'ol boy southern Nascar racing, barbeque picnic-eating atmosphere. From the bathrooms that read Rudy for the boys and Trudy for the gals to the miniature models of Nascar on a faux corrugated iron roof. Mission  accomplished. The atmosphere has that Southern Americana Sunday afternoon picnic feel. 
. 
I began my meal and was surprisedly underwhelmed. The pork felt mass produced. Of course it is mass produced but it does not have to taste mass produced. The bun was generic a Walmart bun - the cheapest of the cheap and it tasted like it. 
Why would a restaurant have the cheapest of the cheap buns for its sandwich? A small red flag started to sprout in my consciousness. I began to look around with an aroused suspension.
. 
I looked at the table clothes. The red and white checked table clothes reminiscent of Sunday picnics. Nice touch and it really is a warm and fuzzy accoutrement for the picnic ambience the company is providing. As I exam the table clothes I see they are the cheapest of the cheap. \"Okay,\" I think (being generous), \"they are throw away table covers. The end of the day comes and they are easily replaced keeping things neat and clean.\" I pull up the throw-away table cloth and what do I see? A cheap Costco folding table. Yes, I have three of them at home. So underneath these fine cheap table cloths are cheap Costco folding tables - not actual picnic tables. I shifted my weight uncomfortably in the chair. I looked at the chair and low and behold it is a Walmart metal folding chair. I do not own any of those. I rejected them. They were just too cheap and uncomfortable, but here I was sitting on one of these chairs here in this restaurant today.
. 
Then the restaurant management insulted me. Posted in repeated spots throughout the dining room floor are cutesy signs that, in a failed attempt at humor, tell you what to do. One sign, in particular, refers to picking up after yourself; as if that is not obvious. The entire restaurant is geared around self-service, but these good 'ol boys want to shove the self-service concept in your face so they hammer it home with tasteless fictitious humor ordering you to clean up after yourself because they don't want to pay for the labor. I begin to feel manipulated. 
. 
I earn my living as a financial analyst. One of the tasks I frequently perform is that of auditing companies. I am well acquainted with preparing financial statements, best practices business procedures, and internal controls. So I really appreciate efficiency, well managed operations, and the bottom line. I, like everyone else, attend movies, go to dinner, shop at the mall and in the majority of those consumer experiences the companies I interface with are driven by the profit motive. Thank God for the profit motive. I am a capitalist. It is through our freedom to start businesses and keep the great majority of that profit that our lives are magnificently improved overall. So I want everyone I do business with to make a profit. When, though, I interact with a company I want to feel good about the experience. I want to be seduced. I don't want the profit motive shoved in my face. 
. 
As we left the restaurant I felt conned, the cheapness of the bread, the ordinary meat, the portion sizes of the potato salad, the underlying cheapness of the tables and chairs, the non-funny posted signs ordering me to be clean. I looked back at the restaurant building and I felt laughed at for being a rube. 
. 
I will not return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best BBQ
Flew in from LA and drove straight there. I'd eat there everyday if I lived here. Great sausage, brisket and bb ribs. Get slaw and potato salad."}
{"text":"The moist brisket is to die for.  I love to smoke all kind of meats myself, but Rudy's has the brisket going on."}
{"text":"I am from an area of the country where BBQ is known for its high standards and quality. This restaurant came highly recommended and my anticipation was high due to the fact it is hard to find good quality BBQ in Phoenix. The service was fast, the dinning room has that down home pleasant feel, and that is where the pleasantries end.

I ordered the smoked pork ribs, baked beans, and coleslaw. The ribs were smoked but boiled before hand. The baked beans turned out to be reasonably seasoned pinto beans. The coleslaw tasted as if they had simply taken the cabbage from the bag and added a generic dressing to the mix. 

The other catch to the whole experience is (BUYER BEWARE), they weight the proteins (brisket, ribs, turkey, etc...). The cost of the meal was overly priced. 

The entire meal lacked the desired flavors my appetite craved...

For those who know BBQ, don't insult your finely tuned tastebuds with this so called representation of smoked BBQ. Just because its has the smoked flavor, doesn't make it BBQ..."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!! Feels like Texas in here, the worker are the best, and the food OMG what can I say about it, delicious and one of the best BBQs I taste so far.. don't miss out the moist brisket and the a man pudding. The ambiance is so country and relaxed and just open and chill (y)"}
{"text":"This place has immediately become my favorite place for BBQ in Chandler.  Great food, good atmosphere, fast and friendly service.  Only gripe from me was the long line, but it was most definitely worth the wait.  Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This place is great I love their Turkey it's so juicy, the brisket and pulled pork are really good as well the ribs were not that great they were OK. The peach cobbler was delicious. This is definitely the spot for good BBQ and good comfort food"}
{"text":"Great for large families or groups. Very friendly and attentive staff. They really make it a fun experience. The line can just be very long at times.... It'd be 5 stars if they passed samples out while waiting."}
{"text":"Believe the hype--this place is awesome. The lean brisket is delicious and moist. The turkey is amazing, and the pulled pork is soooo good. As far as the sides go, well, they are just \"OK.\"  But, who needs sides when you can go and fill up on delicious, smoky goodness AKA have a meat fest! I did like the creamed corn, but the beans were mediocre. I think every BBQ joint should have awesome beans, so that was a disappointment. The banana pudding is nice, too. Oh, and the breakfast tacos are HUGE and really yummy. The only complaint I have is the price, but honestly you get what you pay for, and at Rudy's you pay for some top quality stuff."}
{"text":"I was expecting something else. .. I feel like they serve the meat like if people were dogs. On a piece of paper.. really? !? Will never come here again."}
{"text":"We go out of our way when we are anywhere close!  Their turkey is absolutely amazing.  Like their coleslaw, too--- not too mushy or creamy!  The place is basic.... but that's barbecue!!!"}
{"text":"4.5 starz for Rudy'z!
Don't get out much to the southern boonies and thru word of mouth found this BBQ Texas gem.  We had a group that mostly live that way so with a visit to the nearby outlet for a new pair of running shoes, we made a full day out of it. Meat meat and meat also worked out to be an awesome gluten free suggestion for our friends with sensitivities. 

The menu was super easy to navigate cuz we didn't have to! As soon as we entered the order line a staff member came up and asked us if it was our virgin visit and proceeded to explain the options available in their BBQ universe, and also said the counter staff would accommodate some taste testing prior to ordering. What an awesome example of customer service. Meat is purchased as in a meat market where the menu simply states the price in 1/2lb increments and you can order more or less and pay by whatever the weight machine measures up!

So we got some tastings of their regular leaner brisket, the pulled pork and prime rib, all were exceptional and we could've gone for any of the three, but I had my mind set in some type of ribs, and the staff suggested the regular pork ribs over the baby back for a more meatier serving. Hubby got the moist brisket as the lean was in fact too lean for his tastes. We passed on the bread which is offered in a half or full loaf, not sure if it's made in house but glancing at the volume, the plastic store packaging gave it away. Our choice was to go Texas big or go home, so we ordered the baked potato with the works that was bathed in super heaves of sour cream and cheese...yes hibernation will soon follow.

Everything was beyond Guy Fieri acceptable and we had a great meal, particularly you can ask for barkier (is that a word) brisket too! So for a good time at a casual joint, excellent BBQ, Rudy's is a change in our dietary routine and the epitome of a cheat night! The outdoor patio was also pet friendly as we brought Luke who scooped up any scraps before there even made it's way to the floor, Woof!"}
{"text":"Second time here. I ordered the moist brisket and some turkey. Both were very good and did not disappoint. I wish I could smoke turkey like this at my house. I will once again be leaving with a bottle of BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I feel sorry for Texans if they think THIS is good BBQ!  Go to Joe's BBQ in Gilbert.

We were excited to try a new BBQ joint closer to our house since we normally go to Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert..  Now listen fellow yelpers, you have never steered me wrong.  So I was convinced this was going to be good, after reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a 4 start avg for this place.  I cannot say that I agree with the good reviews of this place at all.

We arrived at 5:45 PM on a Sunday eve and were cheerfully greeted by a young lady who helped us figure out how it worked.  You grab a bottled beer or soda (or they have cups where you order for fountain drinks) and then order at the counter.  No line and we got up to the counter and I decided on the moist brisket, given the good reviews I had read on here.  I watched them cut it up and throw it onto some wax paper and put it in our feeding trough (some crazy basket that they put all of your food into, as there are no trays or plates!).  I decided on beans and creamed corn and then the guy asked if I wanted white or wheat bread. I chose white and he slapped 5 pieces of Wonder bread into the trough.  I don't get the bread part and they give you way too much.  Off we went with our basket of food and we found a picnic table to sit at where we didn't have to eat with strangers at one of the other long 20 person tables, like on a cruise ship!  We then checked out the condiments and I grabbed a paper container filled with pickles.  Had both the sissy BBQ sauce and the hotter one and they both were ok.  Nothing to write home about.  The creamed corn looked and tasted like someone just took corn niblets from a can and put it into some cream.  It was not tasty at all.  The beans were not bad.  But the moist brisket....it was moist alright - it was oozing fat!  I think 50% of the meat was fat.  I was somewhat disgusted.  My husband had the same thing and he did not like it either.  Luckily, he had chosen Lay's BBQ chips for his side. Cannot go wrong there!!  Pretty sad when the best part of your meal is a bag of Lay's BBQ potato chips.  

I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back \"ya'all\"."}
{"text":"My husband and I always stop at this RUDYS on our way to California or back! Makes the trip way better for us! I love how they have free wifi and the food is so good!"}
{"text":"BBQ is not generally a classy man's meal, and Rudy's does not look like a very classy joint, so I was skeptical walking into the place.  There are lots of picnic-table style seatings, some red and white checkerboard table cloths, and a trough full of bottles of beer and soda, surrounded by ice.

We walked up to the counter to order, and from that second, it was a 5-star experience.  The girl at the counter was really friendly, and gave us samples since we had never been there before, so we could figure out what we wanted.  The cook/bbq'er/meat cutter behind the counter was having a good time, yelling back for help whenever people were waiting, and getting excited whenever someone new came in and wanted to try samples.

The food was absolutely amazing.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it's BBQ, so don't expect exotic plating, but if you want delicious meat on a bun or baked potato, and want to walk away full and satisfied, this is the joint.  It was too hot when we went, but in nicer weather it looks like they open up all of the walls to the outside, which I'm sure makes the atmosphere that much better.  I can imagine returning when it's nicer out, grabbing a few brews, and killing an hour just sitting in the breeze and getting fat off of pulled pork.

There was only one thing I didn't like about Rudy's, and that was the country music playing the entire time, but hey - if you like country music, then YEEEEE HAAAWW GOOD BUDDY go ahead and enjoy that, and even if you don't, it wasn't enough for me to knock a star off of the rating."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Rudy's, be it dine in or to go. We always get the prime rib, brisket and pork loin which are all terrific! The green chili stew is also superb! Thankful we have this decent place in the West Valley."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Rudy's (Chandler location). I've been hearing about how good they were from a co-worker and from my neighbor.  I had a wide assortment of meats and overall, they were very good.  I will be going back again soon.  There is still plenty more item's for me to try."}
{"text":"Finally a good BBQ spot in the west valley. Prices are pretty decent and the food is awesome. When you place your order they pull the meat out of the smoker and slice it right in front of you. The smoked potatoes with meat is my personal favorite. The only negative to the whole place is the wait. Line can get a little long, but it's worth it. Oh, and don't forget to tell them it's your first time. They will let you sample the turkey and brisket to see if you like them."}
{"text":"You must try this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  So good and cheap! First Responder friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bbq ever a real juggernaut in this BBQ game staff great food even better cant wait to go back highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"It is such a treat to go to Rudy's! Casual atmosphere and delicious food. I had to laugh at the other reviews who did not appreciate the rustic charm of Rudy's. It is San Antonio BBQ, for Pete's sake!  The turkey is to die for as is the pulled pork. We love the creamed corn and were pleasantly surprised with the beans on our last visit. We have tasted everything on the menu and it is all great.  Be sure to take a container of the pork green chili stew 'to go' and have it with eggs the next morning. Yummy!"}
{"text":"From a chef's point of view was not impressed, food was bland and sauce was not so good."}
{"text":"Delicious and nutritious.  Not a place for PETA supporters. The food is really good I really like the voice brisket. I like the fact that you can make the sandwich exactly how you like it. The sauce is the best sauce ever made in the entire world ever made ever ever ever."}
{"text":"The wet brisket was great as was the pulled pork. The chicken was excellent. But.....I went there for the ribs and I was a little disappointed. Gotta get the potatoe salad and cream corn sides."}
{"text":"I have mixed thoughts about Rudy's. On the positive side, it's an awesome setup with very nice employees. I LOVED the cream corn and peach cobbler. This ribs and breakfast burrito were pretty good too. My husband loved the corn on cob and it looked delicious. I HATED the pulled pork. It was so bitter that neither my husband or I could eat it - it went straight into the trash. They smoke with White Oak, and the bitterness makes your toes curl. I also didn't care for the cole slaw, brownie or the banana pudding (pudding very bland). 

Will I go to Rudy's again? Definitely yes. I will try to hone my selections until I get my favorite meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I just stopped on in because BBQ sounded good she ordered smoked sausage sandwich and I ordered the beef brisket sandwich. That was some of the best barbecue I've ever had, definitely compares to the Texas barbecue I enjoyed while I was in Texas."}
{"text":"NO BACON FOR POTATOES REALLY? Anyway they have a lot of red on there brisket other than that solid so 4/5"}
{"text":"This place is great. Clean with an open space atmosphere. The friendly staff will walk you through the process of ordering and give you free samples to try.

The moist brisket was awesome. It's fatty meaty goodness didn't need sauce but i appreciate that its there. 

Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"the best beef brisket i have ever had. i usually try to get the breakfast beef brisket burrito 2 to 3 times a week. 

would definitely recommend this place, you will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food everytime! ! My 3 year old loves it here, especially the turkey and daddy like the whole hottie jalape√±o sausage and a half pound of brisket.  Does it everytime! Then I have a happy shopper for the rest of the day and usually left overs to boot.,) love Rudys! But I also lived in Austin, TX where Rudy is a weekly staple. The only downer about Rudys here in AZ is the staff in Texas is always way more lively and genuine and loud.  Only thing I would improve on is the hospitality, )"}
{"text":"So everyone raves about this place but I was not impressed. The atmosphere was good, good was ok but I don't like the sauce :(  The bbq was average at best. I want a late also. The cream corn was very good. The sides were the best part by far. This will not be a place I go back to."}
{"text":"If you want real deal barbecue, I can think of at least five or so places throughout the valley that beat the pulp out of Rudy's.  The food here isn't bad, but it isn't GREAT.  From the samples to my actual entree, the sides and the dessert (banana pudding), everything just fell kinda flat for me.  But what Rudy's lacks in flavor, they make up for in ambience.  The inside of the restaurant is really cute and cheery.  I felt like I was in a barbecue joint in the middle of Texas.  I like the self-serve aspect of the restaurant (the only thing they do for you is get your your meat and ring you up).  The staff is very friendly and helpful, so that's always a plus.  And if you're looking for a cute, fun place to bring the family or a group of coworkers, I would recommend Rudy's."}
{"text":"So yesterday I finally made time to check out Rudy's BBQ.  I work right around the corner and have been to the place across the street several times and figured it was time to give this place a shot.

It was almost 2 PM when I arrived and I was greeted by someone who explained how the placed worked.  I was able to walk right up and order, but I've seen the line backed out the door on more than one occasion so it was definitely the time of day (I purposely went later to avoid the crowds).  

I ordered a 1/2 lb of smoked turkey, half a sausage link, pinto beans, and a large drink for just under $14.  The turkey was moist & tender but I didn't taste much of a smoked flavor.  It wasn't bad at all, it just wasn't great.  The sausage was good also.  I like spicy, so I only tried the spicy bbq sauce.  I found the stoppers on the bbq sauce bottles to be cumbersome to get an appreciable amount of sauce to come out.  I actually didn't care for the sauce, as it had an overly-tangy flavor which overwhelmed the meats.  I really prefer when a bbq place has the big kettle of sauce as opposed to bottled sauce.  The beans...well they were OK...definitely no pizzazz to them...for just being plain pinto beans, they were decent, but definitely not great....if I go again, I'll probably try the cole slaw instead.

I've been to a few mom & pop bbq joints in Tx and Rudy's does a good job of duplicating that ambiance.  Bare concrete floors, long rows of tables with paper table cloths on one side and picnic tables on the other...and that open ceiling architecture.....I can imagine the how loud and echoie (is that a word???) the place gets when it's packed!

I read some reviews complaining about the wax paper in lieu of a plate....sure enough, my paper split open while cutting off a bite of sausage...exposing it to the table.  Hope it was clean...I ate it anyway  lol  

I'm giving Rudy's 3 stars because I think it's OK, but not great.  I will go back and try the moist brisket to see how that goes.

Good Eats,
B"}
{"text":"Rudy's catered a graduation party for forty people and everything was awesome.  The brisket was great and the corn was fabulous.  Marcus delivered tons of great food and was very helpful in setting up the dishes.   

All very professional and I would recommend Rudy's to anyone.

Also congratulation to Tara Gonzales"}
{"text":"The moist brisket is out of this world.  The baby back ribs and prime rib were just ok.  They have a limited side menu.  The prices weren't great but if you go there get the moist brisket it's amazing."}
{"text":"This is the place the group always goes to when we have a big gathering.  The food is awesome and you never leave hungry with the amount they serve."}
{"text":"So good! So good! So good! They staff is super duper friendly and they explain the menu and gove you samples so you get exactly what you want. The meat is to die for, perfectly smoked and not dry at all. Im not a huge BBQ fan in general but their Bar BQ sause is ON POINT!!! Nice open seating spaces perfect for two or large groups. Open early for breakfast (trying those next time) and the country store has everything else. I live in Glendale but its so worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing! Everything about it is awesome, from the food to the employees. Everyone was very friendly and patient. I would recommend this place to anyone! Can't wait to come back to try something new!"}
{"text":"I've used Yelp many times, but never posted a review til now. The food we received from Rudy's BBQ made me sign up for a Yelp account to post because it was so terrible!  After hearing about this place I assumed we would give it a try as we like BBQ and it is close to our house.  It is clearly overrated!  My husband did take out since we have a 2 year old and going out to eat lately is near impossible.  He had to wait in line for at least 20 minutes on a Sunday evening.  
We both ordered brisket sandwiches.  When I unwrapped my sandwich it looked great with a lot of meat, that is until I took the bun off to add sauce.  There was so much fat on this sandwich, more fat than actual meat.  I took a picture of it because I was so disgusted.  My husband said that he even asked for extra lean meat.  After pulling out the fat I ate most of the sandwich.  The meat wasn't great, a little dry.  I ended up eating my 2 year old's Costco chicken nuggets which were way better than the sandwich!  We will stick with Joe's BBQ, Tom's BBQ, and Famous Daves!"}
{"text":"Amazing spicy brisket sandwich and for $5! Kid friendly and military discount! Dillion's is out and Rudys is in  I'll take the extra 10min drive to enjoy a tasty meal. Can't beat having dinner for my family of 5 for under $30"}
{"text":"Brisket was delicious. It's a bit of a drive, but definitely worth it.  They have a great selection of different types of meats, sides and beverages (including beer!).  I haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Standard barbeque fare. We don't live close by but were in the neighborhood and wanted to try something new. Meat was good but nothing I would drove across town for. Best thing I had was the jalape√±o sausage - delicious! And they carry a large selection of Shiner beer."}
{"text":"Overrated bbq: baby backs ribs were a lil tough, and not even close to falling off the bone. potato salad was fine, but the cole slaw and Rudy beans were horrible.
The chicken was a little dry but is probably the only saving grace at Rudy's.

Should have driven to Lucilles in Tempe."}
{"text":"It's was good. But you have to eat off of wax paper which is stupid.No plates.!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Love the atmosphere and the people who work here are super friendly and knowledgeable. If you don't know what you want, don't worry, you can sample anything ! Love the pulled pork, ribs, creamed corn, breakfast tacos and they have their special \"sauses\" for sale too! Everything tastes great, they have awesome sweet tea, & a reusable cup that you can purchase for a dollar to support military, and you get a free drink on your next visit. The people who manage it are the best! It's all about the taste and experience and both were amazing !"}
{"text":"I am a native Texan and recently gave this place a shot.  Good food, all my Texas favorites too.  

We had the brisket, sausage and pulled pork.  The spicy sausage was awesome.
Brisket was very good and my wife loved the pulled pork.

We had a great time and will be back.  We sold my smoker during our last move.  I won't be buying another, just going to make Rudy's our home for great bbq!!"}
{"text":"Rudy's has breakfast? RUDY'S HAS BREAKFAST!!! And it's amazing! Amazing flavor and great value. It is definitely a surprise and a great one at that!"}
{"text":"You can't find good barbecue food in AZ, but this is awesome!  The turkey is my favorite.  Loved this place in NM, and now here in AZ."}
{"text":"Can't say enough  about this place. When your there let them know it's your first time. They may let you have a sample of what you want to order or make suggestions to you. This only traps you into ordering everything on the menu. Order by weight here...the least amount I believe is 1/4 lbs. that's enough to leave you wanting more, but leaves you room to try different items. It's cut fresh when you order and in the smoker until your ready. There is no wait staff it's cafeteria style dinning. I would recommend the green chili stew, moist brisket, and cream corn. They serve a breakfast burrito but I haven't been  able to get there in the morning. One day ..."}
{"text":"I love the way Rudys is set up, the whole barn look and the line to get your food sort of reminds me of elementary school.  

The food is great, you can taste the smokiness in the meat.  I usually get the brisket or prime rib, although I have tried the baby backs and jalapeno sausage which are amazing as well.  

Great place to take the family, it can get a little pricey though."}
{"text":"I grew up in San Antonio and we often drove up the I-10 toward Boerne for their brisket.  Okay, maybe compared to the original location and compared to some  joints in the Hill Country, this place rates four stars, but it is certainly the best BBQ in Arizona.

I know that there are regional disputes and tastes about BBQ and that there are rib and sausage and pork people from Up North.....and DAMMIT, it is the rub NOT the sauce!  If you want Hill Country, South Texas beef brisket, Rudy's is the place and at reasonable prices.  They serve Shiner's!   They make the other stuff too but BBQ really should be brisket and all else is novelty, bar-B-Q flavored food.

It is on Chandler Blvd, just East of the I-10 and worth the drive.  Pity the chump that opened his BBQ place next door, just weeks after Rudy's opened."}
{"text":"Ehhhh, defiantly not competition worthy BBQ.  They have 2 mediocre BBQ sauces on each table.  Both list Corn Sugar(high fructose corn syrup) as an ingredient.  Unfortunately they use bar speed pourers as tops and of the 3 tables I tried, all were clogged.  I ended up just pulling the top off to finally get to the disappointing sauce sealed inside.  I wonder what other terrible industrial ingredients their meals hide.  Bland BBQ sauce did a poor job covering up their far from fresh day old meat.  Hint: fresh quality ingredients prepared with respect and care = good food.  Never going back.  Dirty restaraunt, bored staff, and bathrooms to match."}
{"text":"Food is amazing but the thing I love the most is their customer service. They go out of their way to give you the best experience possible. I even saw them tell an older couple to have a seat and they will take their order and bring it to them. 

This and the food quality will keep us loyal customers."}
{"text":"Rudy's, the place I dragged my wife to for my birthday... if you're hankering for BBQ, straight-up delicious meat, ya gotta check 'em out. That moist brisket... I gotta get it every time. A buddy of mine is hooked on their potato salad, too, and the turkey WHEN IT'S SLICED THINLY... they sometimes cut it thick like a turkey steak, even against his wishes. I don't ever order it, though, cause the \"moist with bark\" (bark is the blackened good stuff on the ends of the brisket) is all I need.

The plastic silverware and eating off of paper, on long tables, is a minor gripe. The line can be a drag. The sides... well, they're OK, but there's not really a \"lite\" option, like fresh veggies or anything, you know? Plus, their desserts, while wrapped like they're homemade, are FULL, literally FULL, of ingredients you can't pronounce, which is a drag... These are the things that keep us from coming here more often. But let's be honest, you go to Rudy's for the meat. I think there's a joke in there somewhere...

One more thing.. they have Big Red soda. I never knew this amazing soft drink before Rudy's, and I get it every time, much to the dismay of my stomach, which turns on me if I get a refill!"}
{"text":"We said this was our first time and they gave us samples. We loved the moist brisket and turkey as well as the flavor of the beans. We will definitely return next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Had high hopes as I love good BBQ. 

But after three trips here, I won't be back. Feels like a cafeteria. Food not that good. Dry nearly flavorless meat. Over priced for what you get. Sauces average. Sides overpriced. Coleslaw way too dry. 

Noisy. Uncomfortable seating. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good bar-b-que at Rudy's. My favorite is the breakfast tacos, which are less than $2 each and made fresh every morning.

The dinner food is very good as well, specifically the pulled pork and brisket. The only thing holding the 5th star back is the pricing. The a la carte style of ordering makes it very easy to end up with a large bill. If you don't mind that, though, it's a solid meal!"}
{"text":"How do I love this place, 10 years ago I stopped by one in 
Albuquerque,NM- I went nuts, there was nothing like it in AZ. I went out and bought a smoker just so I could have something like it, came really close too. But really who has 16 hours to smoke brisket, yeah me either. And now it has arrived:
So here's the low down, the brisket is Awesome, hands down awesome! Pulled pork and green chili stew are great! Chicken & links are really good too but I don't  go for the ribs, not my favorite!  All in all great smokehouse!"}
{"text":"This is di spot to go when you are craving for some smoking juicy meat. I love the breakfast burritos but watch out for the calories count."}
{"text":"My family and I came upon this place when we moved to Arizona and we loved it ! Their meat is very lean ,perfectly smoked and full of flavor ! The only thing I wish they had was more variety of sauces to add to your sandwich ."}
{"text":"Their barbecue sauce is the best! I always order an extra bottle and take it home to use for home grilling. Their sides are so delicious, especially the corn. The sausage wasn't as good, but then I'm not a sausage fan. I went with a big group of people and got to try bites of almost everything. I would order the brisket again and multiple sides."}
{"text":"I love the Rudy's experience and food. However, I am currently sitting here attempting to eat lunch and sweating like a pig as they have two of the large garage doors open with 106 degree heat blowing in!  I don't know if they are trying to save on their AC bill or what, but close the doors!  It's summer in AZ. Avoid this place unless the doors are closed!"}
{"text":"Really solid BBQ place the meats are tender and actually good enough to eat without BBQ sauce. Also the customer service there is very good and they give plenty of free samples if you ask."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the breakfast brisket taco. You must try it if you stop in for breakfast."}
{"text":"Got a to go order of 1/2 lb of moist brisket and ribs. I took them home immediately and ate. The brisket was grand but the ribs were disgusting. Ribs were a little tough and flavorless. After a few hours I got the bubble guts then I had to destroy my bathroom for hours and my stomach still hurts while writing this. I like rudys but right now my stomach says otherwise and my stomach can muster a lot of stuff. I wanted to pick up BBQ instead of cooking it myself and I get the poops."}
{"text":"Really good ribs and brisket. I like them best without the bbq sauce. The ribs are meaty and moist. The brisket melts in  your mouth and their red potatoes could be considered comfort food. Their regular bbq sauce is a bit to spicy for me and their \"sissy\" sauce is too tangy. I prefer a sweeter sauce or just a dry rub.

If you go, plan ahead because there is usually long lines at peak meal times. It's a stand in line, order at the counter, food served in a paper wrapping then in a deep tray type of place. Picnic table style seating.

There's plenty left to take home and the leftovers are even better!"}
{"text":"moist brisket is the way to go. + creamed corn.

baked potato with chopped meat - yum.

breakfast taco - yum.

pork ribs - yum.

turkey - a bit on the dry side.

chicken - very moist. surprisingly good.

prime rib - good.

pretty much everything is good. they are great about letting you try anything you want (sides, meat, etc) prior to purchase. the service is always quick, even if the line is long."}
{"text":"We were in the area at lunch time and this place was recommended. My wife and myself were not disappointed. Pulled pork and moist brisket was to die for. The place was clean and layed out well. Try there  normal sauce . It's spicy but great. Although it is a ride for us we will be back."}
{"text":"We stopped here not knowing what to expect - just looking to grab a quick bite. We got a lovely tour/how-to and then were helped by Britney.  She was amazing!! She helped us understand what would be best for each of us, and even let us try some samples.  The brisket was so good, and she was so nice, we bought some to take back to Orange County.
The design is fun - cafeteria style and the layout allows for plenty of room, even at the self serve station (napkins, sauces, forks, fountain drinks).  The beer selection was great too - I had a Shiner Blonde I'd never tried before and loved it.
I'll be back for sure as soon as possible."}
{"text":"So delicious!!  You could taste the smoke on the meat!  We tried the brisket, baby back and pork ribs."}
{"text":"we love rudy's bbq from texas so on a recent vacation to phoenix when we saw billboards that there was a rudy's we were thrilled.  turns out we arrived in phoenix on rudy's grand opening day (4/5).  we ate there there on sunday 4/8.

we love the brisket, the chicken, the pork loin.  and the sauce.  so delicious.  everything there is highly recommended.

we bought a couple of bottles of rudy's bbq sause to take home."}
{"text":"Yum. I like Rudy's. I used to eat at Rudy's when I lived in Albuquerque. My favorite meal was smoked turkey and the butter drenched potatoes and it is here in Chandler too. The turkey is tender and a bit smoky, potatoes are perfect and very buttery. My only complaint is the turkey was excessively salty! So much so that I thought it was just a bad night and we went back the very next day. Yep, the very next day.

Let's talk about the atmosphere first. You park in the parking lot and take a deep breath of smoking meat goodness. You walk in and typically get welcomed by someone in the gift shop/country store. Then go stand in line around troughs of drinks, soda and beers, pass by a big fridge full of desserts in small containers. They have many cash registers so the long line will go fast, order off the board, all the typical meats, sides,  AND GREEN CHILE STEW! Get the stew or you will be sad, it is like straight from NM. The real deal. They take your order people in line behind the registers are cutting, slicing, chopping your meat fresh and weighing it out. If you order potatoes they may ask with butter? Um, hell ya. Drown 'em. Do you want sliced white bread? Not me but maybe you do. Pay and stop at the bar for peppers, sauces, napkins, utensils and paper to put down on your table. 

Go find a big picnic table to sit on, spread out your paper and dig in. Two sauces on the table, regular with a little bite, and one with a big bite. We tried it all the second visit and enjoyed everything but the turkey was still very, very salty.

I loved the green chile stew and will be back for that but given the choice between Famous Dave's and Rudy's - I would probably choose Dave's. Maybe it's the atmosphere as Rudy's is a bit of work, plastic utensils, no plates and no price break."}
{"text":"Ordered baby backs, spare ribs, sausages, and briskets (both lean and fatty ones). If you are a fan of brisket, I would highly recommend this place. Both lean and fatty were great. I prefer fatty ones. Much juicer and tasty for obvious reasons... 
Both ribs were great too. I prefer this place over Can't Stop and Joe's BBQ. If you are thinking about ordering those spicy sausages, you can just skip them. Little too dry for me. Get regular one- they are much better."}
{"text":"Great experience, great food. Rolled into town later than the dinner hour and found this place, checked yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. So glad we did, the bbq and the sides were delicious, the dining experience fun for our whole family of 6! Everyone had something different and we were all pleased with the quality of the meats and the tasty sides ( hot and cold) We only had room for bites of desserts, table was divided over which was best-banana pudding and chocolate pudding. Bought some bbq sauce for xmas gift in the little general store, hope it makes it back to SF."}
{"text":"Loved It! Went on a slow afternoon when the crowd had disappeared. I stepped to the counter and the little girl behind it basically took me to school on bbq and all of their sides. Before getting a chance to order she was plying me with spoonfuls of cream corn (amazing) and their vege chili  (out of this world). She had the slicers carve me pieces from their smoked turkey breast, two kinds of brisket, pulled pork, and smoked sausage. After swallowing I decided to take home a half pound of the lean brisket, some pulled pork, a couple of sausages, and a bunch of sides. Everything was great. The only knock I have is the bbq sauce is only so-so. Fortunately all of the meat was so succulent and well seasoned that the sauce became an afterthought.

Also, the meat is sold by the pound not by the plate, so you get exactly what you pay for."}
{"text":"Brisket with burnt ends, best in town. Smoke and BBQ is amazing. Nothing else needed...."}
{"text":"I still think it's funny that this is right next door to another BBQ restaurant, but hey, that's okay as long as it's good. And it is good! Not the best I've ever had, but not terrible. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The service was amazing. They asked if we had ever been there before. It was our first time they brought out good size samples of tons of bbq!  I got the pulled pork sandwich, it was so yum! I added regular sauce on it. My kids got the turkey it was the best turkey I've ever tasted! The atmosphere is awesome!  Just a really great place all around! I highly recommend this place and if I could give more stars I would! My all time favorite place to eat hands down!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great chicken and Green Chili Stew.  The line to get your food moves preety good."}
{"text":"Awesome smoked meat, doesn't matter what you choose...it's all exceptional, the only issue with this fun all around experience is - not having room to enjoy more food"}
{"text":"THE WORST BBQ I HAVE EVER HAD (and I'm from Santa Fe, NM)
We tried it last night, take home. It was the worst bbq I have ever had, bar none! The ribs tasted raw; the green chile stew had NO meat and a horrible flavor, and being from NM believe you me, I know my green chile and stew; the creamed corn as filled with sweet cream and corn that tasted like baby puke with sugar... then again, demographics are everything and this one we tried I guess was perfect for the truck stop area of which it was located, Avondale! 

I would rather eat at Applebees and eat their crappy food before ever going into this wanna be bbq place again. It's sad because we don't have a good one in town, and we were pretty excited to try it. SUCKED!"}
{"text":"Brisket was really good.  Loved the free bread option, if purchasing meat by the (portion) of a pound.   1/2 a chicken was very moist.  Both BBQ sauces were good, too.  Potato Salad was creamy and tasty.  Have been here once before and will go again when visiting Arizona again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE this place! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is just great. Country music & country themed, and the employees are very nice. I bought a big bottle of sissy sauce and don't regret it at all lol!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ!!  Brisket and pulled pork were so good and the coleslaw was to die for!  There were two sauce options on the table - might have preferred a few more options, but they were both really good.  Unique set up, reasonably priced - just a fun place to eat!"}
{"text":"I am very excited that there is a Rudy's in the state of Arizona. Best brisket, cream corn and peach cobbler hands down. Don't go for the atmosphere, go for the great food!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome. A very traditional bbq with some amazing brisket, ribs, chicken and everything they have. I feel like I'm in Texas when I'm here. Love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"First time eating at Rudy's! Loved! Came
With my 2 boys & husband well having 3 males is always an A+ since they love to eat tasty food, we all picked baby back ribs, beef brisket and pulled pork 
I just got to say \" Smokey Delicious\" best bar-B-Q ever! 
Juicy, tender, smoked just perfect! 
The place is clean, the set up is Awesome! Love the ambiance.
You got to try this place."}
{"text":"Rudy's is awesome, all of the meats are fabulous, and the tea is terrific! The side dishes on the other hand leave a little something to be desired. When we are in the mood for protein Rudy's is top of our list. I highly recommend them.

I personally like to eat on the patio, especially during the monsoon season."}
{"text":"Rudy's moist brisket in Texas is still better the Chandler Rudy's is my go to place for BBQ.  Some visits taste better than others thus the missing star.  Brisket tacos are great.  As far as comparing this to other places,  Little MIss BBQ's short rib is the best I have had in town (including Bobby Qs) but Rudy's beats their regular brisket, and forget about any normal dining time at Little Miss BBQ.  My bar is brisket is too high to give Rudy's a five but even now they are very good.  Seating and speed of service are both very good."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Sacramento, Ca and this restaurant was so delicious! Best BBQ I've ever had! The atmosphere was so fun, picnic style. We tried a lot of different choice meats and sides, everything was very deliscou!"}
{"text":"Gret prices and Tasty food plus friendly staff  I'm a picky eater but the coleslaw and BBQ sandwich was bomb diggity! I love beans all kinds but sad to say the beans could definitely be better compared to the flavor on all the other food. Other than that great BBQ and tasty BBQ sauce. Also neat set up inside with fun decor very unique!"}
{"text":"I'm here now and just finished eating 2 tasty pulled pork sandwiches. It's nice that they let you try the meats before you choose. The atmosphere is pure Southern style which is to my liking. After this visit I plan to come back and try some more. If southern style comfort food is on your mind I'd suggest giving Rudy's a shot."}
{"text":"I was so shocked to learn that there're TWO bbq places just across the street of each other that I have to try both. Rudy's is the first one but I'm not planning in comparing against each other but to rate my experience.

The ambiance and decor is nice if you like the back patio setting style with big tables barn-like. I liked it but I could easily understand people being annoyed by this.

Service. A line-up service where you buy your food by the pound with the drinks in coolers is kind of interesting. It reminds me Fuddrucker's back in the late 80's.

Presentation. A huge tray without plates, all in paper (butcher paper) gives (again) that backyard family bbq appeal that can be disappointing for some people.

Price. The price is just OK, not a bargain (given the self-service and no silverware/china) but it's not a rip-off by any means.

Food. The meats were tasty but they cook them without sauce. I had lean brisket (which was pretty good) and baby back ribs. Being said that the meat is tasteful, the sauces are on the lame side. Nothing impressive and the hot and mild have a forgettable flavor.

Would I go back? Maybe.

Would I crave to go there? Absolutely not."}
{"text":"Great place to eat !  The meat was very good.  Our favorite was the moist brisket, Turkey, Baby back Ribs, Sausage.  The sides were good too we had potato salad, cole slaw, Rudy's Baked beans, and corn on the cob.  The pecan pie was good too. Staff was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Rudy's is the best barbecue in the state of Arizona. If you happen to venture to this fantastic eatery... I would suggest to pick up the chomp breakfast taco and accompany it with a side of potato salad and a delicious cream soda from the beverage trough....Just do it, you will not be sorry! 

They serve breakfast tacos daily from open till 10 am and you're able to add in items if you get there before 10, if you're after 10 because you slept in, it's still okay because they have the breakfast tacos ready to go in a heater right by the cash register, it will always be a perfect moment for you."}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel next door so for dinner it was either this place or the BBQ across the street, and I picked this place because of that extra half star on yelp.

The wife and I split some moist brisket, ribs, and half of a jalapeno sausage. The sausage had a lot more kick than I was expecting so eat it last if you want to save your taste buds. The ribs were alright, good seasoning but it didn't blow me away.
 
The brisket was great though. Really moist with a lot of flavor. They had two sauces to choose from, both of which were alright. We also got a side of potato salad which was pretty good too.

I'll have to come back sometime to try the prime rib if they ever don't run out."}
{"text":"I first discovered Rudy's in Austin TX when I used to visit my friend there. Their moist brisket and cream corn was and IS amazing. Whenever a friend was visiting Texas I would always request at least a pint of cream corn for them to bring back. When I lived in Goodyear I could not wait until this location opened. It was the second most exciting place to go to besides Target. There's not much to do in the West Valley! If you've never been to Rudy's before you can ask for samples. Be sure to grab a banana pudding too while you're there."}
{"text":"I don't want to be a killjoy, but we visited a week ago and were disappointed.  When we got in the door we were greeted with a 20 minute wait that reminded me of a Disneyland ride, except louder!  The cashiers shout orders to the cooks, the cooks shout at the cashiers, and the manager shouted at everyone.  The other complaint I have is the lack of plates.  I just don't like putting your food on a questionable table top with only wax paper between it and my food.  I ordered the moist brisket, and although tasty, my portion was very fatty.  My wife had the ribs and thought they were good but not great.  All the sides were good and my wife did love the creamed corn.  To be fair I guess we will give it another try, but we will bring our own paper plates."}
{"text":"This place obviously caters to those who have never had really \"legit\" BBQ. The ok, it is average or just below average for bbq joints. The baby backs were tender and had good flavor but BBQ sauce is horrible. The corn on the cob was a soggy mess, it had to have been sitting in water for hours. The beans had decent flavor but I ordered a medium serving and got 95% juice with a extremely small portion of beans. The pulled pork was below average, and since the sauce is so poor, it couldn't help the pork. The peach cobbler was disgusting, it had a undercooked gooey dough crust!!!! Overall it is much too pricey for the quality of food. Save your money and make the trip to Mesa and hit up Waldos. Or if you want a chain BBQ place, Famous Dave's is a much better choice."}
{"text":"Finally a decent BBQ spot for the far westsiders..been here a few times already... not bad, breakfast tacos are great and even better price.Came back when it was crowded,but my food was to go and the service was fast. I was in and out in 15 minutes and yet my food was great had jalapeno sausage sandwich with potato salad and beans..all good. The wife had loaded potato and she enjoyed it... Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for their breakfast tacos.

Brisket breakfast tacos anyone? Rudy have them hot and ready to go in the morning if you're craving some smoked meat in your tacos. It's so great that I don't see a point of eating lunch on days when I get the tacos. Well cook tortilla with eggs, potatoes, and brisket is a must try! Did I mention it's only 2 bucks per taco? (for 3 toppings)

Do yourself a favor, just come here breakfast, not lunch, because you'll be too full for lunch anyways."}
{"text":"Yesss honey, get yourself some ribs, a loaded baked potato and a jalape√±o sausage finished off with a coke and you have the best meal on earth! 
Not only is the food amazing, the atmosphere is so cute. Picnic like with country music and kind employees :) my fianc√© and I are frequent visitors, we'll never stop coming!"}
{"text":"It is okay if you don't like sweet bbq sauce. Personally, I like honey bbq sauce and they didn't have anything close to that. However their brisket was amazing and had a great smoke flavor to it and their sides were delicious. We ordered the ribs, the brisket, coleslaw, potato salad, stuffed baked potato, and banana pudding. I wouldn't order the baked potato or banana pudding ever again. Would I return? Only if someone ELSE was dying to come here.  I prefer Can't Stop Smoking BBQ across the street from this place. Love their sauces and more variety over there."}
{"text":"The absolute best BBQ in PHOENIX.! Prices are reasonable for BBQ. Recommend the moist brisket. It falls apart in your for and is so tender. Great babysat ribs. Ask to sample the meats. Everything we tasted was amazing."}
{"text":"Simple, clean, delicious. Reminds me of Phil's BBQ in San Diego but not as heavy and oily. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, my sister got a half chicken, my dad got a half chicken, and my mom ordered the brisket and everything was absolutely delicious!! The meat is so juicy, thick, and perfectly seasoned. We also got a small potato salad and some corn on the cobb, both of which were good but not outstanding. I can't wait to come back here when I visit Arizona again!"}
{"text":"Wanting to tuck in that napkin and just have a beer with plenty of slow roasted bark on your brisket, then this your place. Y'all come for picnic style and excellent BBQ. This is a meat lovers delight with a simple ambiance. Don't dress up unless jeans and boots are your style."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast deal in the state, (and lunch & dinner also deliver the delicious big time!)"}
{"text":"Went here opening day and was disappointed. My family and i are from the south so we had hoped this would be something like the bbq we know and love but this was like a deli/cafeteria. All sides are premade and sit in styrofoam cups. The meat is cut and weighed at a counter for you and placed on a tray. No servers so its no a full service restaurant. There is also no variety in the bbq sauce. Overall it was a weird experience and not for us. The food wasnt worth going back for either."}
{"text":"The moist brisket is very good, and the various BBQ sauces are fantastic. You order at the cashier, so you get your food very quickly. There are many tables located throughout the restaurant -- we were able to find seats for our group of 7 very easily. Would likely go again to try out some of the sides and other meats."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Bar-B-Q in town. 

Now I realize that Texas, Kansas and Memphis are known for Bar-B-Q but we are not there. We are in Arizona where Carne Asada is king. So I for one am glad to have awesome Bar-B-Que  in Arizona without making it myself. The Brisket is amazing and I am usually not a fan of this cut of beef. The Ribs were equally amazing as was the sauce. Nice job Rudy's for filling in the gap that has been missing in this town."}
{"text":"This place was really good. First of all, they recognized that it was my first time there and have me a ton of samples. Great customer service. The lean brisket, chicken and banana pudding are awesome! I didn't try the sauces since they weren't cook with sauce, just a rub. It didn't matter to me because the meat was tasty and juicy. It's a little pricey for lunch because you have to pay ala cart, but it was delish. Super casual atmosphere and really cool environment."}
{"text":"After having eaten there several times, here's my 5 cents:

I love the Prime Rib!  Yes, it's $9.49 for 1/2 lb, but can I make prime rib at home like this?  No.  Not even going to try.  I'll pay the premium.  Prime Rib is offered only Fri-Sun.

The brisket is either really good, or not.  The brisket at Can't Stop Smoking is always good.

The pulled pork here is phenomenal!  

The sides here are better than at Can't Stop Smokin, in my opinion.  

One of the overlooked menu items is the Jumbo Baked Potato.  I usually get one loaded with meat.  Talk about a meal!!  Guaranteed to stuff you for the night. 

The bbq sauces are a bit tame.  I still love Famous Dave's 'Devils Spit.'  

All in all, a very good place to eat, and it is no frills.  You don't have a waiter, but you might have to wait.  Usually a line at the place, even almost 4 months after they opened.  

So you know it's good."}
{"text":"Meat but the pound and cooked fresh. Yum! Our family had been here a couple times and they have never diassapointed us. We've tried a little bit of everything. My two favorite so far are the baby back ribs and the lean brisket. The coleslaw is amazing and the potato salad is great too. 

The atmosphere is so relaxed. U literally sit at picnic benches and eat off of paper lol. Doesnt get better than that!! They also sell thier signature bbq sauce in the little store there. Used it at home to bbq and it was fantastic!

Great place to go with family and friends"}
{"text":"Didnt care for the taste of the food..As far as a chain restaurant goes, Famous Dave's was way better in tatse and price."}
{"text":"Great staff very friendly. Always great food have not disappointed me yet. I have been here for lunch at least a dozen times and I will be back for more good food in the future. 
Thanks
Frank"}
{"text":"From the moment you get out of your car, you know you are in for some great BBQ.  The seduction of the sweet aroma of BBQ smoke draws you to the front door.  Once inside, you know this is going to be good.  This is the BEST BBQ I've ever had!  There is no question about it, this is the go to place for incredible BBQ. We tried the Baby Back ribs, the Moist Brisket, the Pulled Pork sandwich, the Pork Loin sandwich, the Sausage, and the Coleslaw.  Everything was outstanding!  My favorites were the Moist Brisket, Baby Back Ribs and the Sausage.  That is not to say the pork sandwiches were not great because they were, it is just a personal preference.  Rudy's is well organized and able to move a large line of people through to the order and pickup counter very quickly.  

When you are in line, you have a responsibility.  That responsibility is to decide what you want before you get to the counter, and please don't hold everyone else up by standing in front of the refrigerators trying to decide which size coleslaw you want.  You will forfeit your place in line.  Once you've ordered and picked up your food; your condiments, self service drinks and wax paper are your next stops before securing your table.  The environment is absolutely \"family fun\"!  At your table you will find two BBQ sauce choices.  One is labeled for sissy's, the other is for...well...everyone else!  There are some great desserts that include some serious chocolate pudding, cobbler, pies and Rice Crispy treats.  If you didn't pick up your dessert when you were in line ordering your meat, no worries, you can buy your favorite treats from the little shop on the left as you first came inside Rudy's and either take it back to your table or home with you for that special late night snack. 

There is plenty of parking and Rudy's is well located for easy access off of Chandler Blvd near I-10.  I hope Rudy's will some day consider opening a restaurant in San Diego!  This will be a must stop when visiting in Chandler."}
{"text":"Savory brisket with sides of beans and sliced bread? Yes madam! I had 1/4 of lean brisket and 1/4 of the fattier brisket, both I thoroughly enjoyed. I enjoyed the environment; picnic style, very very casual. I will definitely be back for some more helpings. I recommend this place for big parties."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try.  When the people coordinating the line found out I had never been there before, they gave me the intro. Sounds like a meat out.  They had lots of choices for meats all smoked.  We got there about noon, and it had a line to the front door.  Interestingly enough, the line did seem to move pretty. At the register, they asked me if I wanted to sample anything (since I hadn't been before).  I went with the smoked turkey.  Wow.  I have to say that this is the 1st time that I've gotten turkey that was not bone dry. The turkey was charred on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  Color me happily surprised.  =)  After reading the reviews on here, I decided to skip all the sides, but did get a sample of the green chili soup.  I think that would be a winner. That taste was most excellent, and it had veggies.  Most of the sides seemed to be a mayo fest, so it was a good call on the skip.  My co-worker, got the prime rib - apparently they offer it on the weekend.  I was less impressed with his prime rib.  My key takeaway from this visit was to go with someone and share. I found 1/2 pound of turkey just WAY too much.  My co-worker was happy to finish it off for me.  My one only slight complaint is that this is must more of a family ho-down type place than a nice dinner out.  I'd suggest getting it to go and doing your own sides at home to go with the excellent smoked turkey.  =)"}
{"text":"I thought I'd give rudys a try today for my birthday and OMG WAS I IMPRESSED. Can I give more than 5 stars? They served us samples for our first time, and the smoke from the brisket and turkey literally smacked me and my husband in the face. Lol. My husband and I actually met working at a BBQ joint, and let me tell you, our old place of work has NOTHING on this! Nothing! Thank you so much for the staff and wonderful service for my birthday. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"There are two Rudy's Country BBQ in Phoenix, one in Goodyear and the other one at Chandler.  I have visited both locations numerous times and I would easily give the one at Chandler at 5-star, but not this one at Goodyear.

This restaurant, Rudy's at Goodyear won't give you the same great experience like the one at Chandler, because this location lacks the quality control.  This means you are likely to get \"bad quality\" meat from time to time,  especially during weekday.  

Why?  Here is an example.  You order moist brisket, but you may end up getting something dried.  This is because they try to exhaust all the meat that's already sitting there for a long time before they take the fresh ones out from the kitchen.  From a quality control standpoint, you should throw away the meat once it's been in sitting in the \"warmer\" area for too long.  This is just like McDonald giving you a burger that has been sitting there for so long to the point that the paddy gets dried and hard; same logic here.

So yes, you might get some REAL moist brisket if you are lucky.  They are nice and juicy, worth the driving.  It takes me 35 minutes to get to this location and I don't care if I have to bypass Dillons or other BBQ places along the way.  When the moist brisket is done right, you are looking at the best brisket in Phoenix (restaurant quality, some of you have PhD in BBQ so I am sure your home-made can still beat it of course).

Or, if you are unlucky, the staff will fill your order with some dried moist brisket.  To avoid this, just go during a weekend because there are more people during that time and the turnover is much higher.  By the way, don't even bother to sample the meat.  Sometimes the meat you sampled is from a different cut.  Instead, ask the service staff to bring the order in front you, so you can examined the meat with your own eyes at close range.  Those meats are not cheap, so don't settle for less.  The staffs are always friendly so they are very easy to work with.  They give you the \"bad stuff\" probably because the managers told them to do so.

What a shame, this restaurant can easily take down a 5-star since everything else is just great (right beer, right atmosphere, you name it).  Unfortunately they still beat other BBQ restaurants even after they slack off, so I guess I will stick with it until I discover another great BBQ restaurant.  Any suggestions from the BBQ-expert yelper will be greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"I needed to order some food for a party in Ahwatukee but I am in California. Caitlin was so very nice and professional in helping me decide what to order (and believe me, I called many times and she was always pleasant and patient). I ordered chopped brisket (a crowd favorite - none was left), baked beans and corn for 40 people. They also gave me butter, bread and BBQ sauce. Everything was delicious and received rave reviews. The party was a huge success and much of that was thanks to the food from Rudy's! I would definitely recommend the food for parties!"}
{"text":"Good portions of the food and the taste is good as well.  Nice to have fresh made and fresh cut meats.  I tasted the sausage and it was ok and i have had better at other local places.  Also wish they had some other vegetable choices besides starches...i.e green beans, spinach, or something like that.  The corn on the cob is always good."}
{"text":"Rudy's is a a bit of mixed bag. 

The Good... First off, I'm a fan because the food is real good. They also have a great selection. Lots of options and even some breakfast options. The different sauces are great. 

The Bad... I didn't give this place a higher rating and was a bit reluctant to give it 4 stars, because of the seating. When you go out, you expect more than folding tables and hard benches. No Beef ribs... 

I recommend getting take out from here."}
{"text":"still my favorite BBQ for the price can't go any were for BBQ thus cheap Evey thing is Al cart I get brisket and diabetic corn I mean sweet corn so good over all just good"}
{"text":"I was in town for business, so stopped in here with a group of coworkers.  I've tried BBQ in a number of places with serious reputations for BBQ, and in the end, I think that Ruby's is just A-OK.  Not a thing wrong with it, just nothing transcendent.    It's a pretty casual place--you order at the counter and take your food with you.  I liked that.  I got a Shiner Bock beer--liked that, too.  But really good BBQ makes you stop in your tracks, and this just didn't.  Doesn't mean it wasn't worth it, though."}
{"text":"Pretty good, nothing out of this world but I would come back.  I had the regular sausage and a half chicken.   Good smokey flavor.  No frills here, no plates just a piece of wax paper."}
{"text":"Damn, this place is so good.....so good. Do yourself a favor and get some, or even six pounds of \"brisket lean\". You won't regret it. Everything else is great too, but who doesn't love perfectly flavored smoked brisket? Do it. Do it. Dooooo it."}
{"text":"It's ok. In my opinion a little less than average. Not a good side selection. Brisket was dry, chicken tasteless and the jalape√±o sausage well use your imagination. No combo plate, no dinner plates and no good food. They do have good parking."}
{"text":"Okay, so this is a BBQ place in the tradition of  the south.  You order by the pound, you help yourself to the cold sides before you order, and your beer selection is made as you wait for your turn at the order counter.  

Visiting the Chandler area with friends, we decided to go here for dinner on recommendation of the locals we are staying with.  We all had the moist brisket.  It was delicious and mouth watering.  We sampled the sides of creamed corn, cole slaw, potato salad and green chili.  All were outstanding.  The seating is family style and you bus your own table.  All in the south tradition.  The decor is rustic and very fun.  The staff was friendly, helpful and quite entertaining!

If you want good BBQ and you are in Chandler, why not stop in and get your brisket on! 

Solid four stars for this establishment.  

Now some folks are upset about the plastic utensils, the self serve attitude, but that is all part of the fun of Rudy's.  You won't find any snooty waiters or table service here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a guilty pleasure. The BBQ is amazing. I've mostly had the moist brisket, but that's my bbq preference. It's served a la carte, they slice the meat right in front of you, and the line moves faster than you would expect. This is my favorite bbq place in the valley. You gotta check it out if you love bbq. It's very pure.

There are some downsides, and the only reason I didn't give them a five star review. They serve the food in a large plastic beat up crate. Maybe I'm just not getting it. Your food is simply on a piece of white butchers paper. I wasn't sure what to do with all that paper. Unfortunately they don't have plates. Without plates, it's hard enough for a gown adult. It's even harder when I bring my kids here. They do ask to go back there, so that's a good sign. It's cafeteria style that is a bit confusing and disorganized. Seems like every time I get to the table I've forgotten something. The side dishes are very bbq themed, but to a fault. I personally didn't like any of the side dishes they had. I tried the baked potato and butter side dish. It was essentially potatoes in a broth made entirely of butter. Seriously I'm not joking. You don't get that much butter when you go out for lobster. They have a peach cobbler, which is refrigerated. I don't know what's up with bbq and peach cobblers, but they do it here too.

Again, this is my favorite place for bbq. I just see some opportunity for improvement."}
{"text":"Sooo... During our four day business trip we visited Rudy's THREE times. The other half loves this spot in Texas and was pleased to find this Phoenix location offers even more choices with prime rib on the menu and ready to go breakfast tacos in a bunch of different combinations. This bbq joint has the perfect balance of quality food at a great price and the service was spot on each time we visited. 

My favorites while we were here were the Spicy Chopped, the ribs (every kind was good) and that chocolate pudding. That chocolate pudding has oreos in it!!! So good. On top of all that they have a pickle and pepper bar. That's right ALL YOU CAN EAT PICKLES! Gotta love that BBQ and pickle combo! 

If you're stopping by in the morning for their Breakfast tacos know that they are big enough to turn into a respectable breakfast burrito with the right folding technique and the Spicy Chopped bbq breakfast taco is the best, you can try the others but I've already done the work for you- go spicy chopped!

This location also offers prime rib and it's only $9.99 for a 1/2 pound... pretty reasonable and it has great flavor. 

If you're looking for delicious meat at a great price head to Rudy's and plan to come back for breakfast... we did!"}
{"text":"Ru-ruuuuu! Finally it's landed in Arizona! Much better than other competing barbecue joints and just as messy and filling. Price? Not bad, and I like having options for side sizes as a bigger dude. I just assumed my own pronoun, yes. Sue me. Oh wait, I don't have anything!"}
{"text":"Play starts off with great ambience as you rollup to order your food. Prices are cheap especially considering this is BBQ.  I had the brisket which is one of the more popular items on the menu.  So onto ratings, I give this restaurant three stars based purely on taste of the brisket."}
{"text":"Soo good!! I would recommend their loaded potato with the moist brisket! Yumm! Also their breakfast tacos are a decent cheap grab for the morning. Their baby back ribs have a little kick, but are so delish! And if you are looking for a dessert, their banana pudding cups are just the right amount of sweetness to satisfy a sweet tooth"}
{"text":"BBQ Quest #13 - Rudy's \"Country Store\" and Bar-B-Q - Chandler, AZ. In my quest for the best BBQ joint(s) in AZ, I heard about this place, I had to try it.

As I rolled into the parking lot, I noticed it was packed, so I'm thinking right away, this must be good, but I'm not getting my hopes up yet. From the outside, it looked like a nice little country store.

I walk inside and immediately I'm looking for the smell of smoke - nope not happening. No smoke, from previous experiences, no taste. Oh well, I'm still willing to give them a shot. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty nice - wooden bench type seating - like you would find at a picnic in the country. 

I am greeted right away by a friendly little hostess, \"High how are you? Is this your first time here at Rudy's?\" - Yes, I say, and she began to tell me the process for ordering food - \"You stand in line here and you order at the cashier counter.\" I asked the hostess what type of wood is used. \"Hmm, I don't know\" was the response - and she proceeded to help the next customer in line.

So I get in this serpentine line like being herded like cattle. There is this beverage trough with various kinds of liquids, mostly alcohol, where you grab and hold while waiting in line.

As I'm waiting in line, I notice the prices, from $1.99 to $6.49 for the various cuts of meat. Pretty much keeping up with the other restaurants around the valley I've sampled. I then noticed something that peeked my interest - a sign that said, \"Real Texas BBQ.\" I immediately said, \"hmmmm - I'll be the judge of that.\"

I continue to make my way around the line and I see people carrying these black plastic type of boxes with food in it. I was OK - easy to carry your food and stuff - no plates. 

I get up to the counter  and I placed my order: 1/2 pound of lean brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, sausage, and turkey. I then ask the cashier what type of wood is used. Response - \"I don't know.\" Another person was asked -- response - \"I don't know. I can find out.\" My response - yes please. The other person returned with an answer of \"Oak.\" I asked what else besides Oak. \"Nothing else.\" Ding ding ding ding - I immediately said, \"then this is not real Texas BBQ, you can't say it is.\" One of the biggest staples of wood in Texas is mesquite - I personally use a combination of Hickory and Mesquite -

My order comes, and I leave for home to taste my morsels of goodies.

ANALYSIS: The best part of the meats was the turkey. It had a lot of flavor and was somewhat moist. The sausage was a little spicy and had a good flavor as well. The ribs were a little on the under cooked side and lacked seasoning and smoke flavor. The brisket was a bit dry, a little rare spots, and lacked flavor/seasoning and the oh so famous smoke ring - where's the ring. The pulled pork was very lacking in flavor and it didn't have a very pleasant taste. My family - very picky when it comes to the Q, did not care for the meats very much. They did like the turkey. OVERALL RATING: I'm still searching. But, I would say - go, give it a try and make your own conclusions."}
{"text":"Great food. The concept was a little different i.e. standing in line to order and getting your food while you wait but it was pretty cool once we figured out what was going on. Everything is served ala carte so you just pick and choose what you want and they give it to you. They don't have plates. Just sheets of stiff paper that you eat from. That was a little different too. However the food was outstanding, the service impeccable, the atmosphere was fun and casual and our total bill for two out the door was a paltry $25.00! Oh and you don't have to tip because you do all the work! 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I heard so many good things about this place and was very disappointed, first it was VERY expensive to eat for two people, better value and just as good BBQ next door. This was my first time here, and was over whelmed with the experience the workers didn't make it easy I felt rushed ordering and when I would ask questions, they would roll thier eyes...."}
{"text":"We chose Rudys because of the reviews but it won't be a place we will come back to.
The prime rib was dry as was the brisket and the ribs were 4 little ones so you had to get 2 orders just to get any real meat off them.  The coleslaw was plain and when they offer you complimentary bread it comes from a loaf from the bag.  Way too expensive for what you get.  They should either bake some basic bread or have someone bring in some from a bakery.  I will say it's very clean, organized the staff guy who helped us was super nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the meat. The venue had a clean, professional appearance and cool theme. However, the turkey at the time was more moist than the brisket sandwich I ordered."}
{"text":"Is there is better BBQ West of Texas, I'd be surprised.  I've eaten at this chain in Austin and Albuquerque and finally Phoenix.  Awesome meats, love the creamed corn and my wife craves the banana pudding.  Fun place to eat!"}
{"text":"Texas people will rave about Ruby's, so I thought I give it a go. Initially my expectations got crosschecked when I saw the long tables and the folding chairs, when I expected more like a smokehouse feel to my Friday dinner. But shame to those who doesn't try. 

It is like a whimsical diner, you grab everything yourself and then you stand in line to see your cashier and chat with him regarding what you possibly could want. You order it all by weight and in our order was baby back ribs, pulled pork and the lean brisket. (The reason for the lean, is that the one they call moist - I call fatty.)

Baby back ribs. 
No, I was far from impressed. Yes, they were OK but not all that meaty and I actually make better ones in my smoker. Also, I have serious doubt that these were baby backs.

Pulled pork.
Was OK, but nothing spectacular. Very basic. 

Brisket.
Quite nice actually. But not nice enough to just come here for the brisket.

Sides. 
I know it was made on the premises, but it all tasted prefab - I was not impressed.

Nor was i impressed by this do it yourself and eat like an animal kind of place. I can see myself taking foreigners here as a novelty, but as for quality of food and pleasing experience this will not be my choice of place. For kids I can see the lawlessness of playing with your food without silverware and without plates (yes, wax paper straight onto the picnic table) but as an adult I find this not entertaining and just cater to those who wants to rebel against civilization. 

I find this place highly overrated!"}
{"text":"Just okay. It certainly isn't \"health food\" and no salads are offered. My turkey sandwich was sort of bland. I went at 7pm on a Saturday and there was barely a wait. Alot of people must like this place though, because there was a constant stream of new customers coming in."}
{"text":"Our family eats at Rudys at least once a week. Their breakfast tacos (which they serve every day from 7-10 AM) are a great way to start the day! You can special order them at the counter if you have a little more time (which is what we do because I am not especially fond of the egg inside) or you can buy them pre made. 

Their brisket, bacon and cheese or turkey bacon and cheese tacos are the best... yes, I said turkey! You can get a great low calorie turkey taco for breakfast with lots of protein!  

Their meats are so amazing you will not even need the bbq sauce!  Not to mention their green chili stew! And I can't even count the times I have purchased their sausage and turkey to take home to drop into my home made jambalaya! 

The only reason I did not give Rudys a full 5 stars is because while their meats are so delicious,  we are not crazy about their bbq sauce. But don't let this deter you. This place is well worth a try!"}
{"text":"Having been to this location a half dozen times (and 23 of their current 41 locations) it's safe to say I know Rudy's well. Many would call me a BBQ fanatic. In the last decade my friends and I have been to more than 500 BBQ restaurants in the US. To be honest, it's probably more. We come to Rudy's often because we always know what we are going to get: friendly service, great BBQ and enough food to feed the family without spending too much money. Rudy's is good for consistency. Every piece of meat is cooked well. At this great Phoenix area location I've never been disappointed. 

While many in Arizona might not be aware Rudy's is a chain one that dominates the Texas landscape and continues to grow because it's good. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are stars here. In fact, their breakfast tacos are not only super affordable, but also come in huge portions and out duel most breakfast tacos you'll find anywhere else. 

There's much to like about Rudy's. This, like all the locations, is roomy, and packed with good BBQ options. Meanwhile, there are no combos. Everyone orders meat by the pound (or a sandwich) and have an abundance of choices, none of which disappoint. 

The Meats: 

Turkey: Hands down: some of the best, mouthwatering, tender and moist turkey in America. And, it tastes like this every time. 

Briskets: It can be ordered lean or moist. Moist is for those who don't mind the fatty stuff (which is where the flavor stems from). Lean comes mostly without fat and a a bit drier. Each tends to hit the spot. 

Chicken: To be honest, we often overlook the chicken, simply because the turkey is so darn good. However, if there's a few of us and we want to sample several meats we'll get a half-bird, something no one has ever complained about. 

Sausage: Take a pick: regular or jalapeno. Different tastes. Nevertheless, each impressive.  

Pulled Pork: It's a challenge to order the pulled pork when the rest of the meats are so darn good. Still, it's above average and tends to be less dry than at many BBQ chains. It suffers like the pork loin - not because it isn't good, but since there's so much competition. 

Ribs: The pork spare ribs and baby back ribs tend to be complete with fall off the bone and tender meat. Keep in mind, you don't have to buy a half or full rack. You can order by the bone. 

Spicy Chop: This is a smorgasbord of Rudy's meats chopped up and marinated in spices - and it's one of our favorites. So much flavor. So tasty. A must. 

The Sides/Dessert
 
If you don't mind a lil kick order the green chili stew. Mmm! Be forewarned, it's spicy, but seeing fresh green chilis in the soup proves they make it on site and adds more flavor than you can imagine. The rest of the sides are fine, too. That includes the potato salad, creamed corn and cole slaw. 

On the other hand, normally we stick with the meats and save room for one of the desserts (the banana pudding, chocolate pudding and cobbler are tops (they change seasonally). The desserts aren't made in house (the rice krispy treats are, however, we're told), but do impress and could fool you, because they taste good enough to believe they were made in house. 

When in the mood for BBQ Rudy's is a home run regardless of time of day. You'll find wonderful meat, won't have to spend too much money and can enjoy eating in a comfortable atmosphere. And, in Phoenix, it's tough to find better sweet tea."}
{"text":"I love the cream corn here !! It's the best but the meat wasn't great last time we ordered from here . We ordered the pork spare ribs , green chili stew and of course the cream corn . The ribs were pretty dry but the sides were so good. The green chili stew is my new favorite. Overall the sides were the best part , and it was so expensive.  I'd come just for the sides next time lol !"}
{"text":"Ordered a smoked Ham for Christmas this year and it was yummy.  Wish there was one on the West side of Phx!  hint hint!"}
{"text":"Classic BBQ place, cafeteria style with meat offerings by the pound. Brisket was delicious & my son loved the ribs. Large portion sizes on the sandwiches. The sauce on the table is in a difficult to use bottle. The potato salad was overly mayonnaise based & not tasty at all. We might try this place again & get different sides. Hopefully they change the sauce bottles for easier use."}
{"text":"Extraordinary, astonishing, sensational, & remarkable food.  Hands down.

My & my gf moved here from San Antonio, Texas to attend ASU in Tempe.  We live in Ahuatukee on the I-10 two exits away.  We used to go to Whataburger all the time.  This must be a Texas obsession, because I BARELY see any around.  Anyway!  The minute we saw the sign where it said ,\"Coming Soon, Rudy's.\" WE BOTH FREAKED OUT, & said, \"Oh My God, Rudy's is coming here!?  Shut the hell up!\"  Then we waited, & waited, & waited some more......  Then one day I see that it is completely built & there are employees walking around the place.  Almost there.  Finally, Grand Opening!  Immediately after getting out of work I go directly to Rudy's to wait in the MASSIVE line snaking around the building.  There must have been more than 100 people in that line easy.  We did not care.  We proudly wore our Rudy's 20th Anniversary shirts that we had from back home.   

Former & current Texas residents imagine this:  I used to live literally across the street from the Rudy's that was serving Sea World on US HWY 151.  Yup, right there.   And I went often.  Sometimes even with my sportbiker crew that I rode around with.  Rudy's is the absolute sh**.  My gf & I always talk about how we miss Rudy's & she even had her parents ship her the bottles of Rudy's Sause.  That's how much we loved that place.  So there we are on opening day waiting about 30 to 45 minutes for pure goodness.  Then we get to the front of the line.   I love how the staff yells.  They did that at in San Antonio, too, but these guys are super loud.   Love that.   We did notice that the sides items (coleslaw, potato salad, etc...) are all prepackaged in styrofoam cups in refrigerators which is nice.  They stay cold in there.  Good idea.  Also, we noticed that there was no pickles on the menu.  Rudy's in San Antonio always charged us for pickles that they sliced & served us.  We were very disappointed at first.  We even asked an employee that happened to be from Laredo, TX & she was not aware of the pickles at all.  She might have never gone to Rudy's is why.   Oh well.

Anyway, we get our food in a bottle crate on wax paper, (THIS IS THE WAY IT HAS BEEN DONE IN TEXAS FOR THE LONGEST TIME SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, TOUGH!)  All non-Texans just do not get it & they probably never will.  Oh well, their loss if they never go back.  
So we start walking to the condiment bar & lo & behold there were the pickles!  Free of charge.  Yay!  We nearly yelled at the girl for telling us she knew of no pickles.  Pickles is something you don't play with when it comes to Rudy's.  You NEED to have pickles with your Rudy's barbeque, people!  No butts about it.  We have a laugh with the girl & the manager about the misunderstanding.  And by the way, that awesome manager, Marcus is the absolute Bomb dot com.

So at last we sit down on the old country benches to eat.  The moment of truth.  I like to refer to this moment as \"P.H.E.\" PURE HEAVENLY EUPHORIA.  

Just as others have said, the brisket is tender, the chicken is tasty, the sausage... oh my.   Wonderful sausage links marinated in Godly flavoring.  Another difference here:  They not only give you white bread with your meal, but you now have a choice of enriched wheat bread.  Lovely.  

I happen to love the sissy sauce.  I think it's just right for my spicy sensitive 
tongue.

One more difference I took notice of.  I used to order the chopped meat back home.  It used to contain a little bit of everything like chicken, pork, & beef.  All mixed in Rudy's Sause.  Not here.  I asked the employees, & they did not know of this of course.  They said they didn't carry it.   Only the pure chopped beef.  That's okay.  Because I love that all the same, regardless.  

I can say that the best meal here would be a quarter pound of chopped beef, potato salad, coleslaw, wheat bread, & either a Big Red or a Coke.  PHE all the way, baby.  

There's no way Rudy's is getting anything less than five stars.  We missed you Rudy's.  We welcome you back into our lives.

That was only two weeks ago.  We've been back 4 times since then."}
{"text":"Let's start out with the disclaimer that I love great barbecue. I love a good smoke ring and charred bits of that taste in my mouth is heavenly. That being the case, I am also fairly critical of barbecue restaurants; especially when I have partaken in a feast of awesome barbecue at Rudy's original location off of Boerne Stage Road in San Antonio. This location in Chandler does not miss a beat.

We had the prime rib, moist brisket, and pork ribs. They all had that signature smokey taste and the meat was tender. The pork ribs didn't take much work to get the meat off the bone and the prime rib was on the rare side, just how I like it. Some people prefer to throw that signature sauce all over the place. I choose to poor it into one of their picnic boats and dip my meat in it. 

For a side we had their great tasting cream corn. For those of you that scoff at creamed corn, this is not your subpar can of cream corn that you buy off the supermarket shelves. No, this was prepared well and the heavy cream concoction was sweet and, of course, creamy. 

We left full and on our way out, we were informed by one of their cheerful and helpful servers that they serve breakfast tacos made to order and some more common variations in a grab-n-go bin. Looks we'll be trying that out tomorrow morning. 

One thing that I do miss from the original store that was not carried over to this location is the smell of the smokers that soaks into your clothes and gives you a subtle reminder of the meal you enjoyed earlier that day."}
{"text":"Loved Rudy's for years in TX and a great taste of TX BBQ.  This is a nice location, but I do miss the old gas station feel, but they try to imitate it.  Went for lunch and wanted to try the chicken but they did not have any yet, so we went for the brisket.  We prefer the lean brisket as it is less fatty (and makes us think it is healthier!).  Had the cole slaw and beans which were very good.  and don't forget the bread to make a BBQ sandwich with.  Only nit is that they don't have diet DP which I think is against the law in TX."}
{"text":"Finally got to sit down and eat here - we usually stop by and grab the breakfast burrito's in the morning. BBQ was just as good as the breakfast!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review only on the breakfast tacos that we had there.  When you walk in I can only imagine that this is what heaven must smell like!  The smell of wood smoldering and meat slowly basting itself in its own juice was incredible.  I had tacos with brisket, egg and cheese.  They were absolutely delicious.  My wife had sausage, egg and cheese tacos.  She said that they were good.  One of the guys in our group got a 1/2 pound of the moist brisket.  He was kind enough to let me try some....HOLY COW....sooo good.  Brisket is one of those few things that, for some reason, I just can't manage to smoke correctly.  I definitely want to go back for the brisket."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best bbq I have ever had. Maybe even the best food! The place is great, employees super helpful and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been back for more. I tried the sausage (AWESOME) and went back for more brisket (AWESOME).

I'm lowering my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because I've now tried all of the sides and none of them are really that good. I expected the full cob of corn to be good, but something was off about it. Soaked in butter too long? Frozen until heated? Meh. Coleslaw hasn't gotten any better. Beans were eh. It needs some work, but for now... I'll just order only meat.

Drink selection is still awesome, seems to change frequently which is nice. Don't be afraid of lines, they move quick. It was out the door and I only waited about 20 minutes and got my food right away. Try getting service like that in any sit down restaurant..."}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan of their signature sauces. We had a little bit of everything., the ribs were tender, brisket tasted overstocked. The food was just okay to me. I liked the environment and the hospitality."}
{"text":"Cold brisket, thick slices, and dry! Over cooked. Not good brisket. I don't even make brisket but when I go to BBQ joints like Rudy's in Austin, or even across the street, it's as close to perfect as possible. This was not good. Diced cold-slaw with no season.
Plus - service was pleasant and cheerful. 2 stars for the service, 1 star for the food. I will not return to Rudy's in Chandler."}
{"text":"Every part of my family's meal was over cooked and flavorless. I was especially irritated by finding string in a rice crispy treat. Cmon man, I understand the occasional stray hair but string?!?"}
{"text":"Best baby back ribs I have ever had. Pulled pork was also the best I have ever had. Rudy's Bbq sauce was incredible."}
{"text":"Very cool place! Genuine Texas bbq! There are no waiters/waitresses, so you stand in line to place your order...might be a problem for some snooty people, but not a problem for me....besides there are some pros to this ....you get your food right away, you get to sample delicious meats, it keeps the overall menu cost lower, and you save 10-25% on a tip. Great smoked meats, plenty of standard fountain drinks and unique bottled drinks, very friendly staff, and a very very large amount of seating....no waiting for a table. This is a fun place to bring a down to earth date or your entire family!"}
{"text":"To start, I am an avid smoker/BBQ and feel like I have a pretty good sense of what's good and what's not. This place us definitely NOT good. Whomever is their so called pit master needs to go back to flipping burgers at Whataburger. The brisket was the driest I've ever had. I literally had to drench it in the BBQ sauce just to choke it down. The smoke was great but it was way over cooked. Then there are the baby back ribs. OMG the driest and saltiest ribs ever! I just finished eating and am literally waiting for the taste to completely leave me. Atmosphere is very BBQ and the staff were really nice but the food....oh that food. Absolutely will not be back. How this place has 4 stars is beyond me. Come on America, step your game up and review better!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, was only given one sorry ass slice of bread for 1lb of brisket. lol this place blows. If I could give -5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Wow... Looked for a breakfast place and ended up here.. We were at the wild horse casino hotel but wanted to save a few bucks.... Let me tell ya if you like BBQ this place is great.... If you have never been here before they will give you samples to try....I hear the breakfast taco are amazing too if you get here early enough ..... Pretty straight  forward actually... It is very clean inside and the staff was great to us....  One thing that was odd is they told me they cannot accept tips.!!! With that said it felt like a restaurant once you got seated..."}
{"text":"I have visited Texas many times and of all the joints I have tried I have actually liked Rudy's the best!!! Now that they are in Phoenix I am doomed because I will never actually try to smoke brisket at home because I can get it here and it is just as good.

Here is the good and bad with Rudy's. I keep buying the good and stay away from the bad. :)

Good:
- Moist Brisket. for those who don't know brisket has two parts, the flat and the point. The flat is lean and the point is more fatty(moist). guess what has more flavor? Yep the moist. 
- Turkey. Sweet mother of sea biscuits!!! Best smoked turkey I have ever had.
- Smoked potato with moist brisket. They cook the potato in the smoker and then add cheese, your choice of meat(moist brisket is the right answer), sour cream, and butter. (This isn't healthy food so don't eat here every day. Remember moderation is key )

Bad:
- The sides... I haven't really found a side that I like. The beans are ok, as is the cream corn and the potato salad. I really could use some Mac and Cheese. 
- The sauce... They love the pepper and it shows in their sauce. I have had much better sauces but they will do if you really need them. Hint: Good BBQ shouldn't need sauce. 

Now in Texas the Rudy's have Dr. Pepper in glass bottles... This Rudy's would have gotten the 5th star if they had that too. 

Either way try the turkey and the brisket with some white bread and go home happy and full. (Full because you remembered to get the potato stuffed with Brisket right?? Good)"}
{"text":"We recently stayed in Chandler near the Rudy's on Chandler Blvd. We decided to walk over for dinner one evening. It was pretty busy, but the line moved fast. Different type of ordering & service with the pick and choose drinks, cold sides, then up to the counter where they give you the hot sides and slice the meat. Prices were fairly standard for BBQ dinner. Brisket was a little too fatty for me and did not like the BBQ sauces. Meat did have a good flavor and was very tender. Beans were very good - would like to see a wider selection of sides including okra. I've had better BBQ brisket and would rate this as only average."}
{"text":"Fun, family friendly joint with a country themed decor. We all loved it! Smoked brisket cut in tender thin slices. Delicious flavorful green chili stew. Hot peach cobbler served in a nice size container enough for our whole family. Cream Corn was unlike anything I've tasted creamy and sweet very tasty. Potato salad tasted like store bought. Also, unlimited sliced bread! We sat out in an Arizona themed style area with TV's which was nice to enjoy during the cool weather."}
{"text":"Best BBQ atound. Great portions and the creamed corn is the absolute best!! Don't forget to get a banana pudding for dessert!"}
{"text":"The lean pork meat in the sand which was full of fat and was flavorless. We had to drown it in sauce to make it edible. Will not be returning. The sides however were delicious."}
{"text":"Friendly service that carries over the Texas charm; clean bathrooms, open seating options, a small bar off to the side, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy. Who else offers smoked prime rib? If you have never been and if they ask; you get samples of the turkey, spicy beef, brisket, and pulled pork. All were very tasty. But none of the samples have the bbq sauce.  Eventually when you get at the table, you get the bbq sauce, its good. The \"sissy\" sause (yes they spell \"sauce\" it this way) is the spicy one. 

Oh yeah; its all a la carte, plastic wear, and no plates. 

I think want to eat this right now..."}
{"text":"My husband loves it here and raves about the food! I've personally hadn't been yet but when I do I'll update my review.

From what I hear it competes with the likes of Lucille's BBQ at Tempe Marketplace. We'll have to see about that.

Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"I have had the baby back ribs, pork spare ribs, beef brisket (both moist and non moist) and the jumbo potato.  

Pork spare ribs are ok, they pepper them which I just am not a fan of.  But they were ok.  Non moist brisket was ok as well, a bit dry though.

The baby back ribs are excellent.  The moist brisket is really just a bit more fatty cut of meat than the non moist but it has much better flavoring and texture.  The jumbo baked potato is awesome.  Its huge, the flavor is amazing.  

You cant beat the price.  Overall the value and quality you get are excellent.  Its best to call ahead and do take out, the line to walk in can take you over an hour.  Its great to have Rudy's come to town."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this location, we decided to try it today.  My husband had the baby-back ribs--they had no flavor and were fatty.  the creamed corn was very good but extremely rich so he couldn't finish it.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and green chili stew--both were very tasty with the right amount of heat.

Many of the reviewers indicated that this is the best of the best.  We disagree.  We have had bbq at other places that was a good and in the case of Dillons, better."}
{"text":"Alright, based on BBQ I wasn't impressed.  Yes the ribs were tender and the brisket was juicy but for me it's all about the BBQ sauce.  The sauces were a bit too peppery flavored and bitter, unlike my Favorite at Famous Dave's which is the Sweet & Sassy.  Only thing I really enjoyed were the breakfast tacos which come in a variety of meats and flavors.  Not a BBQ joint I'd be returning to anytime soon but love the concept."}
{"text":"I just experience the worst Phone ordering in my entire life.  The female name is Ariana, from the moment she picked up the phone to finish she was constantly  talking to someone else and ignoring my ordering.  I have to repeat myself multiple times.  All she had to say to me was (can you hold for a second and put me on hold) I have to listen to her talking to other people, with no apology at all.  I'm all about good customer service, this was far from it!!!  If Rudy was offering training prior to starting this job, I think she didn't attend or wasn't paying enough attention.  Phone ordering is as important as dine-in.  After spending 10-15 mins ordering and listening to her talking to a friend.  She stated that the order will be ready in 20-25mins, she called me back 10 mins later saying there's no more chicken.  No thanks for the great customer service skills!"}
{"text":"The worst Bbq that i have ever tried in my life. It's so nasty. The food has a bad odor. The meat taste like Chimicales. Terrible place."}
{"text":"If you had enough dry and tastiness bbq meat from other place...it is time to move on.  This place will changed your mind...all meats here are so moist and so delicious...I like the moist brisket, creamy corn, baby back ribs, etc...and don't miss their ice tea...it is all good.  Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Well, as a native Texan, I thought it was the best restaurant barbecue I have had in years!  I had the brisket sandwich that I could quite literally cut with the plastic knife provided.  While real Texas barbecue is smoked, loved and rubbed, you won't find it bathed in sauce, that is always on the side.
I found the sauce to be very good...tangy of lemon rather than vinegar.  Not too sweet like Tennessee sauce. I prefer my sauce a little spicy but I would consider it mild.
I had potato salad that I thought was good and would rate it 3 1/2 stars.  The baked beans were not what I expected or would consider traditional style, but very tasty, tangy pinto beans.  I would give the beans 4 stars.
I will most defiantly return for more awesome goodness to try other menu items.  I highly recommend this dining experience for the casual style and for the food."}
{"text":"I love Rudy's!! The cream corn is a must and the turkey breast is my favorite  whenever we are near this restaurant, we always eat there. It's also a nice family interactive meal, it's served kind of like picnic style with the sharing of the meats and sides. We love it here and never leave without a large bottle of sissy sauce to ride us over until our next visit."}
{"text":"Rudy's is new to my area and I'm hungover again. Perfect combo.

Zero wait and on a Sunday that's pretty impressive. Quick and friendly service was noticeable right off the bat. I ordered the pulled pork, moist brisket and potato salad. The moist brisket was fantastic, the pulled pork was a tad dry and the potato salad was about as boring as a house salad. Altogether good food for a decent price.

I'll be coming back here, most likely hungover."}
{"text":"Not what we expected. The atmosphere is fun, picnic tables and buckets of beer. All ala carte. Food is good. I had the baby back ribs, my husband had the brisket and sausage. The beans and Cole slaw is good! Beer is cold! Recommend this place for a very casual dinner or even lunch! Tell them it's your first time and they take the time to explain and give samples!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, the people are helpful and patient and the experience is always a good one! It can be a bit pricey but it's worth it! The moist brisket is my favorite!

I just wish there were some tables that were easier to get into than the picnic table style. :)"}
{"text":"I couldn't rate this place until my 2nd go around only because my first time was take-out.  That being said, I did get the same thing both times and am pretty sure I can say I enjoy their Pulled Pork portion and would get it again.  It is moist, soft, and flavorful all on its own, but I do enjoy drizzling some Sissy sauce on it.  I've also had their corn-on-the-cob twice and found it super plain and not even sweet or enjoyable.. totally blah for me with the corn.  They use real butter, though, so if I liked their corn, I'd be a fan of that.  I'll stick to the pulled pork.

On to their BBQ sauce: I am not a big fan of a few things, mainly how they serve the sauce, which is in a large diameter *glass* bottle with a bottle pourer (the kind bartenders used to control the flow of alcohol when pouring)... no bueno. It took me a long while to get a quarter size sauce on to my pork and it was just frustrating.. and the glass makes it non-squeezable.. and the huge bottle makes it heavy to hold while you're waiting for gravity to help you get that little dab of sauce out and on to your meat... yeahhh, it was that annoying.  Here's an idea: make your sauce fresh and then put it in big ass jars than we can either portion out ourselves (like Joe's Real BBQ) or put it in squeezable bottles (like Famous Dave's)... *anything* but giant glass bottles with pourer restrictors on... puhleeeeze!

Their staff is very friendly, the ambiance is very relaxed and totally casual, pic-nic-style seating and, of course, country.  They have a great concept of huge coolers of booze (beer) where you can pick out your beer and put it in a bucket.. they also have sody-pop and sweet tea.  

Country music on the speakers.... yummy pulled pork... buckets of cold beer... pic-nic seating.. that's what I enjoyed."}
{"text":"This is bad BBQ... As in don't eat here. The ribs were undercooked as in stuck to the bone like glue. The regular sausage was good. The jalape√±o sausage was separated from its chewy no snap casing."}
{"text":"I visited Rudy's to see what all the fuss was about.   I was looking forward to having some great BBQ.  I am not sure if I caught them on an off day, but that was some dry assed brisket.   I will give them another shot and give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"I like barbecue, but I love this place. The brisket is the absolute star of the show.  Every time I go to Austin, TX I would hit up Rudy's barbecue. Now we have one in Chandler, AZ.  If you haven't had a chance go try this place - go!  It is not fancy, but the brisket is amazing.  I tried all the other items and they are good too."}
{"text":"Delicious! Like always! 
The meat is always yummy! It doesn't matter which kind you get. The cram corn and potato salad are the usual!"}
{"text":"Rudy's used to be fantastic, last two times we've been really disappointed.

We placed a to go order at the counter and it wasn't good...

My LEAN Brisket sandwich was all fat. I actually had to trim the fat off each piece when I got home and when I finished I had as much fat as meat. I bit into it and had a mouth full of fat that was nasty.

I ordered a half jalapeno sausage and got this little 2\" piece. The 1/2 sausage was MUCH larger in the past.

My wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich and the pulled pork had onions, celery and other things mixed in. It wasn't just \"pulled pork\" like it normally is. She couldn't eat the whole thing as she said it didn't taste good.

The green chili stew was the only enjoyable portion of the meal."}
{"text":"Really liked the atmosphere and the semi outdoor/ open air restaurant. Like other people have explained it's set up to where you order at the register and then take your food to a table. The servers were very friendly and allowed us to sample a few different meats. 

We ended up with the brisket (not fatty) and it was delicious. Great smokey flavor that you could eat without any bbq sauce. We also order the 3 three bean side, which is spicy and not sweet like baked beans. We had the coleslaw and corn on the cob (both were good). The bbq sauce on the table has more of a spicy, southwest flavor rather than being a sweet bbq. Be aware of this before going there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!

I went out of my way to bring my coworker here after a long day and the quality of the bbq is excellent! We ordered a couple pounds of the moist brisket and bbq beans with a IBC bottled root beer.  The bbq sauce is great and whenever I'm in town I'll stop by.  

Rudy's is right next door to \"Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ and i tried them and Rudys is much much better!.  

The pick nick style seating is nice, even the other customers were friendly and outgoing. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is OK BBQ. The chicken I had lacked any smoke flavor. The BBQ sauce, for me, was more spice than any true deep flavor that I would expect from such a popular place, and the cole slaw had no flavor at all, it was mayonase and cabbage. If you want real BBQ go to either Andrews BBQ in Tempe, or Joes Real BBQ in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Very good bar-b-q and a unique interior. Breakfast is great burritos made to order and quick too"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what all the hype is about.  The turkey is pretty tasty, but other than that we were not impressed.  As other reviewers have stated, just trying to get the BBQ \"sause\" out of the bottle is irritating.  Casual is one thing, but I felt like I was eating in a barn somewhere.  Would get turkey or pork for carryout again, but that's about it."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUS!! I have never had brisket like its cooked here, super moist and just soooo GOOD! We had to go back and order more food since it was so good! In total, we ordered about 2lbs brisket moist, 1/2lb cutter's choice brisket, 1lb pork ribs, 1lb baby back ribs, cream corn, cole slaw, and potato salad. We ate our first batch of meat in literally 3 minutes!! And had to send someone to go back in line to order more food since we were still hungry. The brisket here is literally nothing you have tried before, the flavor and tenderiness is beyond anything I tried at any other BBQ place. My Dad and older brother first tried this when they were in Texas on a BBQ food tour so when we saw this in Arizona they said we had to try it!"}
{"text":"When traveling from Tucson to Las Vegas or L.A., I needed a place to stop for lunch. I finally found the perfect spot right off the freeway in Chandler. This place was quick and the food was out of bounds. The meats have wonderful smokey flavors. I have tried the chicken, pulled pork and brisket. All were excellent! They offer a signature sauce that made it even more flavorful. Service was very friendly and if you are a first time visitor, a greeter will offer you some tips as soon as you walk in. The food was so delicious, my family and I returned multiple times in one week. The restaurant was very open with lots of seating and would be great for groups."}
{"text":"Always my first and last stop coming in and out of Phoenix... excellent \"Real Deal\" Texas-style BBQ straight out of the smoker and cut to order.   Brisket, Pulled Pork, Chicken, Smoked Sausage, Jalape√±o Sausage and of course, true \"fall-off-the-bone\" ribs!

A very friendly staff and a Green Chili Stew  that ranks right up there with Brunswick Stew from GA as truly the FINEST stew I've ever had.  

Staff wears t-shirts that say... 
\"I didn't claw my way to the top of the food chain just to eat vegetables!\"   ?

and....
\"If we're not supposed to eat animals, then how come they're made out of meat\"!  

Worth the trip from CA!!!"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ spot!! This and Famous Dave's are probably our two favorite BBQ chains in the Phoenix area. The only down side is there is no kids menu and they kinda lack on the sides. But with that being said the brisket is so tender that you can cut through it like butter. And the ribs are also amazing. Not to mention the BBQ sauce, the one that I bought two bottles of, is pretty damn good as well. We live in the Glendale area and we travel a good 12 miles to come eat here often to get our BBQ fix! Keep cookin em low and slow Rudy's."}
{"text":"I was told beforehand that Rudy's is amazing and that I had to pay a visit while I was in Arizona.  I think this caused me to set my expectations so high that when I finally did eat at Rudy's, I was expecting to be absolutely blown away.  To be quite honest, I was disappointed and was not all that impressed.  Little Miss BBQ is hands down still the #1 BBQ place in Arizona in my book.

Rudy's is not a difficult place to find since the restaurant is tan, yellow, and red.  The place is spacious with plenty of parking, plenty of outdoor seating as well and indoor seating.

There is a little store inside the place to the left where you can buy the BBQ sauces, candy, wine, Rudy's shirts, drinks, etc.  

As far as the actual restaurant goes, if you have never been to Rudy's before, it is basically set up like a school cafeteria.  You get in line to purchase your food at the counter.  While in line and heading toward the counter, you can grab bottled drinks, sides in containers from the fridge, and etc.  Once you have reached the counter, that is where you will order your main dishes and sides.  If you have never been to Rudy's before or are undecided on what to get, feel free to ask for samples!  The customer service that we received at the counter was excellent and very pleasant.  After sampling different items, my bf and I ended up ordering brisket moist, spicy chop with sauce, ribs, jalape√±o sausages, and potato salad to share.  All of our food was placed in a plastic tray/crate thingie magig that you normally use to store bottled sodas.  

Once you have your food, you go and find yourself a table to sit down and eat.  From here on out, everything is self serve.  There are stations where you can grab napkins and white butcher paper which acts as your \"plate.\"  You just spread it out on the table, place some food on there and feast!  

On each of the tables are Rudy's BBQ sauces which are gluten free!  There's a spicy sauce and a mild sauce for the sissies who cannot handle spicy sauces.  The sauce is really called the Sissy sauce!  Don't worry though, the spicy BBQ sauce didn't really have any heat so you should definitely try it out without the fear of burning your tongue off.  The BBQ sauces did not impress me.  It tasted just like any regular BBQ sauce that you can get at a store.  There was nothing special about the sauces.

The brisket moist I'm assuming is supposed to be moist since the word is in the name but it was not moist.  In fact, it was more on the dry side and not tender.  I drowned the brisket in the BBQ sauce just to moisten it up a bit.  This was disappointing considering brisket is the number one item that I order at BBQ joints.  The spicy chop with sauce was good and I think it would taste good in between hamburger buns.  The ribs were okay.  The jalape√±o sausages were good flavor wise since I like spicy foods, but once again, the sausages were more on the dry side.  As far as the sides go, the potato salad, coleslaw, and etc. all tasted like average sides that you can buy in large quantities at the store.  Nothing special about the sides.  

As mentioned before, it is self serve after you get your food and start eating.  This means that after you are done eating, you have to clean up after yourself before you leave. 

Overall, the customer service was excellent, the prices average, and the food was just okay.  I wouldn't come back to Rudy's unless this was the only BBQ joint that was open and I was desperately craving BBQ.  There are way better BBQ places out there that I would go to first."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The inside looks very flashy. Great ambiance and feel. I love the crates you carry your food in, the picnic table type seating and eating on paper. It all really adds to the charm of the place. Plus, a loaf of bread for everyone! You don't think you'll eat it...but you will.

Line was out the door but it was on Father's Day so I can't really complain about that. The service was very quick for how busy it was, employees do a wonderful job. 

The food was great! As many said, the brisket is a bit dry, but sauce it up and it's just damn fine. The real shining light is the jalapeno sausage. If you go here, GET IT. It's absolutely delicious. The cream corn is the best I've ever had in my life. I don't know what they do to it, but it's amazing. The BBQ sauces were great as well and the green chile stew will not disappoint. If you don't like spicy, it might be a bit hard for you. Many parts of everyone's meal at my party were spicy. Nothing too crazy, but had a kick. 

Verdict: Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried their breakfast tacos, you are missing out! They are basically $2 a piece and are absolutely amazing!!! $14 for breakfast for my wife, son and I! Can't go wrong with that!!"}
{"text":"I wish they have a Rudy's in New York.

At first I order half pound of each meat and try out which ones I love the best.

and now, I always come and order my Baby Back Ribs, Brisket (moist), Prime Rib, Sausage... Well Basically Everything.

Every order is at least 1/2 Lb.  Make sure you have a big appetite.
Love it when is just meat, no sauce (you add it yourself).  Other BBQ places I get sick of eating them because either too much sauce or too salty.  This is perfect!.

If you want sauce, they have the Rudy's Sissy Sauce and the regular Rudy's BBQ Sauce.

Side orders of Cole Slaw, Potato Salad are my FAVES!.....

Very casual place, eat it with your hands or with forks if you would like.... But I like the Man Cave way.

Glad I found you again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The meat is always very good. My favorite is the brisket , very most and has a fantastic smoke flavor. Some of the sides are just ok. Don't care for the potato salad much but my father in las makes the best to I'm tainted. I like the seating style. You just sit by whomever and you don't need plates. Awesome concept and and good for the environment. Did you know that they serve breakfast? As if the meat isn't awesome enough, can you imagine the brisket in a breakfast taco w potatoes cheese and salsa? Talk about LEGIT! And they are huge. So two should do you just fine. I love that they have several different types of barbecue sauce. I like mine w a kick!"}
{"text":"Great Food, courteous staff
We love this place and visit every time we visit the Goodyear area"}
{"text":"It's good enough for me to come back again but I wouldn't say it's awesome BBQ.  It's decent.  They have a good variety of meats to choose from, by weight.  We had the sausage (best meat selection by far), the brisket (cutter's choice - they have a lean and fatty selection) and ribs (not fall of the ribs meat which is how I like it). The sides were disappointing - they didn't taste bad but just not a good selection.

There are single tables for private parties but the main area is picnic style.  Casual, bbq style d√©cor.  You order up front and all your food is given to you when you order.  Decent people working there, very patient.  I'd say definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! the breakfast tacos are amazing and filling. The people there are friendly. The green chili stew is flavorful and just enough spice. never have to wait for your food. They have 2 different bbq sauces. Its not a fancy place but its comfortable. Never disappointed going to Rudy's"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants OF ALL TIME!!! I would eat it everyday if I could!!! I ALWAYS order: moist brisket, potato salad and cream corn!! Sweet tea is good also...mmmm wish it was open - I would go right now!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great. The peach cobbler reminded me of summer in the Midwest. The original sause is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Rudy's grab and go breakfast burritos are quick and easy and yummy! I usually grab the brisket and egg burrito and a jalape√±o sausage and egg burrito! They are pre-made so all you need to do is walk in grab, pay and go...or you can special order a breakfast burrito. Either way you can't resist the smokey flavor of Rudy's brisket and sausages!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Rudy's in TX and this place brought back some good memories. We had the brisket and the jalepeno sausages. Everything was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try more of what they offer. They have TV's set up so you can watch the game too."}
{"text":"Texas BBQ. It gets no better then this. For those of you that have no idea what that means, I will tell you. Texas BBQ is all about the sauce. Yes you could enjoy the meat without any but its not going to have the kick in your pants taste or spice. Yes, its going to be spicy. Stop your whining. Thats TEXAS! The meat is slow cooked, smoked and is perfect. The \"sause\" is award winning so before you knock it remember, its taken home the gold from people that know their stuff."}
{"text":"Food isn't worth the long waits. The meat is fatty and flavor is nasty. There are way better bbq places than this one. I would stay away!! We tried it out several times and each time it was equally bad. What a shame. I was excited when I saw signs for this place."}
{"text":"Food- I have the \"cutter's choice cut\" I had 1lb. it was dry and not most at all, the meat did not fall apart, had a very small smoke ring around the edges. The cream corn is nothing to brag about, it lacks something, just can't put my finger on it. The green chili soup was spicy and would have been better if it was mac n cheese lol (which they don't have) The jalapeno link was good and spicy, but the bbq sauces were alright, the original reminds me of Open Pit BBQ sauce (I like it) and they have a spicy one too.

Service- Cafeteria line, multiple people taking orders, friendly and polite, but felt like a McDonald's of bbq.

Environment- Very large and it has two patios, about five TVs that I saw and then seating is either on a wooden bench or folding chairs. Garage doors for separating area is nice design. Troffs of beverages, beer, soda and IBC root beer."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, especially the prime rib! The atmosphere has a great cookout-style feel.  Walking in, it smells like a campfire.  Some may not know that they also have great breakfast burritos and breakfast bowls. If you want to go on a good breakfast hay ride, without the horses and the hay, give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have been to several Rudy's in the Austin area, really nice to see this location in AZ.  We stopped in and ordered a feast for 8 of us and we really enjoyed it.  The Rudy's method of wax paper and trays is pretty fantastic, other Rudy's will have a roll of paper towels at the table.  This location you have to track down napkins (not too hard to find).  Picture 8 people ready to eat the biggest meal of their life..  The food..  The brisket was great, the Turkey was fantastic..  The green chili is really a winner, everyone agreed this was the silent champion. Service was really kind and helpful, they even had a 20% off discount on a Monday to respect Veterans within our party which was really generous and respectful.  The jumbo baked potato was great, the beans were pretty good and the cole slaw rather average.  I give them 5 stars for Brisket 3 ways and Turkey, the green chili is the game changer and the other sides are fairly pedestrian.  I will be back to this location, others in Texas and beyond.  Solid breakfast tacos as well.  I would say that the pork spare ribs from the Rudy's of 620 in Austin are better than the ones in Litchfield, AZ.  But that's about the only negative I can come up with.  That sause..  mmm yum.."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I loved it. I got the moist brisket and some other stuff. It was like a picnic out there. Loved the sauce on the table too.

Second time I went I didn't like it as well. I think I got a more fatty cut and it was slightly cold.

Not a big deal. I grew up with 3 siblings so you ate what you got and didn't complain! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ joint in Chandler! Been going there with my family for many years, and even held my graduation party at Rudy's. The Brisket Moist is unrivaled. I have visited the Rudy's in Austin, Texas, and this one is just as good! The outdoorsy feeling you get while staying inside, is spectacular, and it almost feels like you are going on a picnic. Definitely recommend going here for the brisket!"}
{"text":"What can I really say about this place, but other than AMAAAAAAZIING!!! I don't think I want to go to any other BBQ place in the Valley now. Keep up the great work. Your employees are also a great representation of your restaurant."}
{"text":"This is some tasty BBQ. I like the environment of the restaurant. I will continue to eat here when in the area. A good find. Try the moist brisket. 'Nuff said.."}
{"text":"Rudy's never fails me! Came here 4 times in Texas while I was on a business trip! Great service and super tasty. Not a fan of the beans but it still works"}
{"text":"Bro. All i have to say is BRISKET BREAKFAST BURRITO $2.00 yes yes yes all the yesssses. So flavorful and filling. At did i mention it was $2 and was big enough to be completely full after (not like those cheaply McDonalds or D&D ones) I'm from Florida visiting and i love me a good breakfast burrito. This place hits the spot!"}
{"text":"So good! Great BBQ and the family mess style eating- butcher paper and all.  I love the cutters choice brisket, sausage, pulled pork... And the sides, cream corn is great and Cole slaw!  My suggestion is to skip the sandwich- order the meat, and make your own with the bread (white, wheat or half and half) they give you with all the fixins from the bar. You can get more bread!  Great sauces, love the sissy and original mixed together too. Get the reusable cup and bring it back- or just have another to use around the house, garden, barn, wherever."}
{"text":"Maybe I am not a Texas BBQ fan.

The brisket was fairly well cooked but the crust was charred and bitter.

Turkey sample was moist.

The pork samples were very fatty and the pulled pork is very vinegar laden.

Potato salad was decent and standard.

3 bean salad had a vinegar and sugar taste but not much else.

Corn was  typical, over-cooked steam table fare.

The meats were prepared fairly well but the over-powering hickory (I assume) flavor and charred exterior made for a bitter after taste that stayed with me and my wife.

The sides were an after thought as with most places."}
{"text":"Thank you , you save me several times of week when there's a long day and I don't feel like cooking more so my son loves you guys. The food and customer service is superb."}
{"text":"Great location and great food! The staff is nice and food is always great. It's aways busy on the weekends, but the lines are fast. Great brisket and sausages. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"FINALLY-TEXAS BRISKET HAS ARRIVED! If you transplanted Yankees don't like this, then don't move to Texas....for THIS food is what my home state of TEXAS is all about. Dave's sucks (who puts brisket on top of a slice of white bread?) What's that for; to soak up all the nasty tasting grease? All the other \"BBQ\" places I have ever tried in Phoenix and the surrounding areas can't hold a candle to Texas BBQ. Now I don't have to make brisket myself anymore. Nothing in this state compares to Rudy's. Grow a pair and live the good life! Thank you, Rudy's....it sure took you long enough to get here......"}
{"text":"I am an very honest on reviews.  I really wish that I could provide a higher rating for this joint, as we had many suggestions to try it, as we are new in town since a few months ago.  It was my wife, myself, adult child, and our two elementary school aged kids.  I had brisket sandwich - Extremely dry and bland.  Wife had turkey sandwich - Extremely dry and bland.  The girls had pulled pork sandwiches - good, but nothing special.  My son had corn on cob and a samling of our sides.  Corn had been sitting in hot water (so I am not even going to commment on that).  Sides were good, but average (beans & potato salad).  Good selection of peppers, pickles, sauces, onions and foutain & bottled soda.  Overall it was VERY average to a bit below average, and I think it would take someone alot of time to convince me to try it again.  Joint is clean, well stocked and staff was Extremely friendly which was kind of what saved two stars."}
{"text":"We just ate here tonight. The line was out the door and we still only waited about 10-15mins before we got to order and eat. I love how you get to pick everything you want before you're seated and the bottled sodas are super! They also have Big Red in their soda machines. I felt like I was 7 again! We got the moist brisket, jalape√±o sausage, chicken and baby back ribs. It was  all AMAZING but I would more than recommend the jalape√±o sausage and the brisket. We also got beans (not bad), corn on the cob (slathered in melted butter and it's a whole piece of corn. Sooooo good.) and chocolate pudding (get it.) 
I love that you eat on butcher paper and sit with everyone else like you're at a HUGE BBQ or fair. I can see why this place is so busy and popular. The service is outstanding. The food is even better. 
We're coming back before we start our move this weekend up to Seattle for breakfast!"}
{"text":"First time here and we had fun! You wait in line similar to airline security to order, but the line goes by quickly. I think we waited in line for 10 min. Plus you can grab a drink (pop or beer) and drink while you go through the line. I'm not sure if it's a Chandler thing, but the people in front of us and behind us were nice and chatty too. They helped us choose our meal and explained the process. When you get to the cashier, they give you a full sample platter before you place your order. All of the meats were good! The Briskit was nicely charred, sausage link was juice and pulled pork was melt in your mouth good. The sides like creamed corn and red potatoes were good too! Everyone we were with gave it 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"went to rudy's bbq on a sat night for the first time, so my first take is that it was like a big warehouse and confusing but then I got in lane and understood de order of things. so everything is a la carte which is odd for a bbq place but oh well to each is own. the meat is by the pound not by the slab so 1/2 POUND is about 4 pieces give or take so that would be your meal if u haven only meat so better add some side dishes. I tried the loaded bake potato brisket and it was great, need more butter but it was good. banana puding was great. meat is texas style rub so it dry. I will still go back for the brisket and potatoe and banana pudding. ps. the prices are very reasonable I had 1/2 lbs rib,2 loaded potato w brisket and 2 banana puding and drinks for 38.00 not badat all."}
{"text":"The food was great.   The atmosphere and quickness were great.   The staff not very inviting.     Our attendant was very neutral , like I just work here.    I went up to ask a question and 4 ladies by the cutting butcher table were gossiping.  3 had backs to the patrons and one facing us.     Not paying attention.   I finally had to interrupt to ask my question.    

Otherwise, pretty good."}
{"text":"Most of my comments about this place are nit picky and not of much value to you. The brisket isn't exactly how I prefer it, but still very good. Other than that the ribs, turkey, and sides have always been solid choices. 

You should eat here."}
{"text":"I can't say enough amazing things. I live in Tucson and drive up for Phoenix JUST to eat at Rudys every 2 weeks or so. That's how much I love it. Anytime I have guests in town I always drive them up so we can eat here, my brother and my dad are huge fans of the Rudys rub and sauce you can buy in the gift shop right inside the door. They use them on a daily basis when cooking. My dad lives in Delaware and orders it online or I buy some and ship it to him. If you haven't been here it's a must! The prices are very reasonable, you get big portions and the food is phenomenal. The staff is constantly helpful and kind, I have yet to go and come in contact with someone that did not exceed my expectations."}
{"text":"Today we had our christmas party and had Rudy's meats. Very very disappointing. The meat was Bland, and very DRY! The brisket, the ham and the turkey were COLD. The peach cobbler was warmer than the meats themselves. Even their barbecue sauce was awefull. I would never step foot in this place to eat. The servers were very stingy with the portions. If I had wanted a kids meal, I would of gone to MacDonalds.
Sorry but first impression count. You do eat with your eyes first......."}
{"text":"Being from San Antonio I missed Rudy's so much! This Arizona location is similar, but different. The BBQ is definitely a winner, but their now commercialized packaged BBQ sauce is horrible! Bring back the other stuff in the Styrofoam containers! I will still keep coming for the brisket when I'm in the area!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cole slaw was just chopped cabbage in what seemed to be water. Pulled pork was dry and tough. I had to add my own sauce when I got it home. Maybe I just don't get Texas BBQ. If this is it, I'll stick with KC."}
{"text":"Mmmmm...creamed corn.  Creamy, sweet, deliciousness.  Moist Brisket.  Smoky, peppery, juicy, so good.  I absolutely adore Rudy's.  We were first introduced to Rudy's in Austin, Texas, and this location does not disappoint.  There is free bread and a pickle station. Everything is sold in either 1/2 lb or lb fashion.  The sides are small, pint or quart.  If you've never been, you gotta jump in your car and make your way to the big red barn and get your grub on.  Most everything on the menu is great, but all I need is the moist brisket (if you are trying to save on some calories, go for the lean...but I say save up your daily calories for just one meal and go moist), and a bucket of creamed corn and I'm in heaven.  Okay, maybe some sweet tea too.  If you're feeling spicy, go for the sausage, it has great flavor!

Hey, driving to Chandler beats driving to Texas.  And this brisket is driving to Texas worthy."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, It's not your authentic BBQ place, but if you're craving dinner, try it out. The best BBQ in the Valley is BOB B Q off of 17."}
{"text":"This was my first Rudy's experience, it was OK. The moist brisket was very good, the pulled pork average, and the corn was terrible. I'd give it another shot but would eat chicken and a different side."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, I'm just not crazy about the format of standing in line to order. They give you your bbq on paper instead of a plate. The floor is concrete, the ceilings are high so it's loud in the dining area. The sides are refrigerated and are in styrofoam containers. Way more casual than I wanted for the price we paid. I won't go back."}
{"text":"The brisket was dry and flavorless, the baby back ribs had hardly any meat on them, the coleslaw was also bland. Considering they just opened... If this is the best it's going to be then I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"Rudy's is great since I'm from Texas and miss it.  I ate there today, ordered the lean brisket and they gave me the cutter's choice.  Staff still have some learning to do.  But this place can easily be the top in the Valley.  Poultry is the best.  Brisket is okay."}
{"text":"I know from people who live in Texas see Rudy's as a chain ... but this is one chain that i simply can't live without! Why can't you smoke meat in California?!?! 

Both types of brisket are full of smokey flavor, yet not over powering. And the lean meat is still super tasty, though not nearly as tender as the moist.

The pulled pork is amazing! Words cannot describe how my mouth is delighted with each bite-full. Simply ... yeah, WoW!

The Chicken, although a small bird ... is surprising tender, well cooked and not dry. How they get the smokey bbq flavor and not a dry bird astounds me!

As for the hospitality, it's no chik-fil a but it's darn close ... got to love southern hospitality"}
{"text":"I am impatient when it comes to very hot weather. So I'm not about to wait in 100 degree weather for BBQ, the best or not.

Sure, Rudy's is a \"chain\", but I have to say that it's the best darn BBQ \"chain\" that's West of the Mississippi!

They have it all; Brisket (moist n lean), pulled pork, pork ribs, Turkey, Chicken, sausage.

It was lunch time, so I figured I'd give their sandwiches a go: the Brisket and the Turkey (hey, I like to eat).

The smoked turkey was so flavorful and tender. For sure surprised my taste buds. But what really got me is the generous amounts of lean brisket that I munched in each savory bite.

It comes dry, but with a little of their sauce ... Yum!"}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite BBQ joints in Austin, tx and our last meal before moving to San Diego.  I was thrilled to find out they opened one in Phoenix when I was there this week!  The moist brisket was the best I've ever had (and I'm not usually a fan of brisket!). The baby back ribs were ok, but the brisket more than made up for it!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Not great BBQ but the west side doesn't exactly have alot to choose from. I do have to say that the peach cobbler is awesome. Way too long of a wait for mediocre food. Call ahead and pick up is the best option if you want to check it out."}
{"text":"Horrible Experience...  

We stopped by Rudys BBQ on our way home from California (Disneyland).  I asked to taste the Prime Rib and it was horrible, I had to spit it out due to not being able to chew it.  

My normal order at the Chandler location is 1 pound of Moist Brisket and 1/2 pound of Prime Rib but due to the poor Prime Rib quality I only ordered 1.5 pounds of Moist Brisket.  The Brisket was far from Moist and near as inedible as the Prime Rib.  I ended up tossing my entire order 1.5 pounds of Moist Brisket in the trash when I got home.  My kids both ordered pork sandwiches that were not much better but pouring on tons of sauce made them edible for them.  

The rest of our party (we had 8 in total) follows my lead with moist brisket and were disappointed as well.  Very poor experience.  

I love the Chandler location and I have never had a poor experience there but this location needs help."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars at Rudy's - probably once every week or two for almost a year.  Unfortunately, the quality and consistency has dropped pretty badly these past 2 months.  The brisket will range from awesome (ie full of flavor, moist) to extremely bland and dry.  The ribs are generally cooked well, but the spice rub will range from a nice even taste to having the rub so thick that you can scrape off a few tablespoons from just 4 ribs.  During our last trip, we heard some customers saying that they also noticed the inconsistency, and they said it was because the more senior (and better) BBQ pit masters have started working at their new location on the West side of town.

We also noticed that their business is starting to hurt in the evenings... used to have long lines Friday/Saturday nights, now it's a piece of cake getting your food.

I hope management is reading this, and take this to heart.  My family very much enjoyed Rudy's when they actually cared about what they served - but now we've been forced to find other go-to places (Little Miss Barbecue is by far the best, but unfortunately they are not open in the evenings)."}
{"text":"Good overall BBQ place. A chain restaurant that i have been to in Texas and NM. they have a wide variety of meats and sides. The best thing there is the moist brisket, gotta get it. Spicy sauce is tasty as well

Meat is sold by weight and the give you a bunch of bread with your meat.
Family picnic style with large table that's everyone shares."}
{"text":"Always great bbq. The staff is ultra friendly and accommodating. Nice mellow atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Service is usually pleasant and the price is very reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"Looking on yelp for a place to take my son to lunch for his birthday and I came across Rudy's and he jump on it. He had not been to this location but had been to one in Texas.  Walked in the door was greeted and everything was explained to us so we know just what to do. I  had pork ribs and cole slaw, husband got brisket moist. And sausages and my son got the same. He also got bread pudding which he loved. Everything was cooked great, this will be are go to place for BBQ and the fact that it is less then 2 miles from home doesn't hurt. Seating was picnic benches which fit the style of the place perfectly. 
I  don't know if it was our timing or not but we got there at 12:30 and had no waiting to order our food. So if you need a fast place to eat at lunch it us a good place to go. 
Give it a try you will be happy."}
{"text":"Rudy's BBQ is a welcomed addition to the West Valley! I haven't had one thing I didn't love, although I honestly haven't tried the ribs yet. Even the smoked turkey is moist and tasty. The atmosphere is welcoming and laid back, and a place definitely fit for kids. I take weekly orders for people I work with to get their breakfast tacos and bring them in. If you haven't had a brisket, egg and cheese breakfast taco with BBQ sauce you aren't living!"}
{"text":"Two Stars= I've experienced better, right? 

And that's the honest truth. The food is on par with a chain restaurant, which Rudy's is.  It's a nice building its clean and the staff is usually very nice. BUT, Its a crap shoot to see what you're going to get, I've found them to be very inconsistent. I've like the hot corn side dish and it's been cool or cold more than once. You never know how the brisket is going to be until you get it, sometimes it's pretty good and other times not at all.  When it's bad I'll bring it back up and get a different cut or something else.  They have always handled that situation very well and did whatever they needed to fix the issue.  That's great but they shouldn't  have to fix bad meals. They shouldn't serve them in the first place because most people won't send stuff back.  I've given them more chances than most places but that time is up.

My last straw with them was when I ordered moist brisket then watched the guy cut my order off the end of the flat. Which just happened to be the chunk he had in front of him at the time. Moist is cut out of the point, it's a completely different part of the brisket, and should be cut in a different direction. What makes that even worse is the moist/point is a buck a pound more than the flat/lean and they charged for moist.  That's WRONG and dishonest, they might as well be stealing from you."}
{"text":"I know this place is usually busy so others must like the food however we found it to be awful. The BBQ sauce is not sweet and rather spicy/weird. 
Rudy's is a big miss for us. 

We prefer a place in Westgate named Shane's. That's yummy eatin!"}
{"text":"Been to one in Austin a few times and was surprised to find one in AZ.  Great bbq. Had the prime rib, brisket and turkey. They turkey was my favorite.  Be sure to get the sweet corn, it's delicious. It's on the list."}
{"text":"It was ok. Pulled pork was barley warm. BBQ sauce was cold and made the pork cold. The bottles of sauce are big and slippery do to being in the refrigerator. Really a pain to get the sauce out. Probably will not go back.  Price was good for BBQ."}
{"text":"Split a Turkey Sandwich and sides Potato Salad (just like Mom's), and 3Bean Salad... the Turkey was so fresh and juicy. Picking up a family size order to go... 
We need a Rudy's near Palm Springs!!!"}
{"text":"Love stopping in to Rudys for the spicy chop and country music! I miss Texas and this place helps to fill that void! The green chili stew is super amazing when you add the sticky chop!! 

Stopped by this morning and was told the breakfast burritos were a 15 minute wait. Meanwhile we see the staff making them behind the counter.  I usually love this restaurant chain, but this location needs some work on customer service."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some good Bar-B-Q. It may be a chain but the staff is always friendly and they strive to be helpful when you're attempting to make that oh so important decision between the lean brisket, the pork loin or the turkey. You can't really go wrong with anything here. I often try to stop by any time I'm in Chandler."}
{"text":"Last Friday was high school graduation for my son. When planning his party I asked what he would like to serve. Rudy's was the response. We got hooked on Rudy's BBQ in San Antonio and it is our go to place for Texas BBQ. 

Since we had about 20 guests I contacted their catering services to see what my options were. The response was quick and informative. We choose to order brisket, turkey, and pulled pork for our meats. Then cream corn (of course), new potatoes, and coleslaw for the sides. 

Everything was wonderful but what really blew me away was the all inclusiveness of the package. Plates, utensils, napkins, serving utensils, even a table cloth and ice were included. Along with sauce, pickles, peppers, onions, and lemonade.   

Next time I have an event I'm calling Rudy's!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay BBQ for Arizona, Mediocre for Everywhere Else

It's receiving 4 stars due the dearth of BBQ joints in the Phoenix metro and people are so desperate for BBQ that this place gets rave reviews. Honestly, I think Honey Bears is far better. There are several flaws with this place. The pulled pork comes with NO BBQ sauce; yes it's served dry and mushy and you have to apply your own. I've never been to a BBQ place where the pulled pork is not served in sauce. The ribs are tiny and the meat does not fall off the bone; the meat is actually quite tough. For pork ribs, the meat is supposed to fall of the bone and be tender and succulent. The baked beans had no flavor. 

There is no chicken on the menu, only turkey.

The sauce itself is underwhelming. They seem to be preoccupied with the idea that \"heat\" or spiciness makes for a better sauce. And that couldn't be further from the truth. We are talking about BBQ sauce not salsa. The best sauces have flavor not heat. Their \"sissy\" sauce was actually their better sauce. Their \"original sauce\" has too much crushed red pepper and almost has salsa like undertones.

Finally, the fact that you don't get a container of sauce when you order take-out is bush league. They have these tiny packets of sauce that resemble tiny packets of butter or margarine at a diner.  Any respectable BBQ establishments gives you a container of sauce to go with your food. And unfortunately, you need more than a container since their food is pretty dry and devoid of sauce. 

Sorry but Phoenix deserves better."}
{"text":"I only had their ribs, beans, and potato salad - but I am not sure if I would go back to sample their other stuff.  The ribs were horrible - no taste what so ever.  The beans looks like soup until I dug my fork in them - and the potato salad tasted like it came out of a container from Fry's.  The place was clean, and employees were friendly but that isn't enough for me."}
{"text":"If you like BBQ, you will enjoy this. I went for the first time Wednesday, had the baked potato with the moist brisket, corn on the cob, cole slaw sweet tea and bread. I tried teh lean brisket and turkey too and I have to say, I was totally impressed. The atmosphere is very country, prolly not a date place, but definitely an amazing family place with great food!!!"}
{"text":"Very inconsistent.  Turkey is the best thing in the menu.  Sides are meh.  Had the brisket a couple times and it was solid and a couple times dry or fatty.  Too incoherent to rely on.  Best thing is their breakfast tacos are half price after 10am"}
{"text":"Nothing really new to update. I returned after several years and got 3/4 pound of Turkey. The prices only slightly went up to like $6.99 per 1/2 pound. The Turkey is still good and lean, the sauce still has way too many ingredients and isn't good and the lines are still long at about noon. Rudy's will always be good, but never great."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the Valley (Joes in Gilbert a close 2nd). 

Can't find brisket like this except in Texas."}
{"text":"There's no waiters; instead, you wait in line to order at what's basically a deli counter. Let 'em know that it's your first time and they'll give you some samples of everything. 

The brisket, pulled pork and chicken were tender and delicious. The pulled pork was good even without any \"sause\" on it. Which was a good thing because I wasn't a fan of the \"sause\". Nothing wrong with it; just not to my liking. (It was too tangy and sweet whereas I prefer smokey and spicy.)

I also greatly enjoyed finding some coleslaw that didn't taste like fingernail polish. (I'm looking at you almost every store bought coleslaw ever).

Even though the decor is horribly kitsch, I loved the feeling of being at a family BBQ. Could really use some paper or plastic plates though. For the price, quality and quantity I think it's a \"smokin\" deal."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've flexed my review muscle but here goes...

This place has some of the best bbq I have ever come across. The brisket and ribs were especially good. The ribs were so tender you didn't need teeth because they just melted in your mouth. We also had pulled pork, corn cobs, sausages, coleslaw and potato salad. All of those additional items were excellent but I still felt the ribs and brisket stood out. There are a couple of reasons this place won't get my fifth star; the noise level and the order process. If you've never eaten at this place before it can be a little confusing on how to order and where to get in line. Not to mention I dislike being rushed and in order for you to see the menu you have to get in line and getting in line is something people do when they are ready to order. I just thought it was a weird set up..Back to the noise level, I like to enjoy conversation with my food and when I don't enjoy the atmosphere I'm in I don't enjoy the food as much. The restaurant is set up with long picnic tables and you just sit anywhere. The tables are right next to the ordering line and the ice machines, etc,. So there is a lot of noise an activity right where you're eating. In conclusion the food is delicious, the price is right and the atmosphere is...acceptable. So, belly up to the trough!!"}
{"text":"I love Rudy's and good TX BBQ and was missing it so dearly until now. Used to go here all the time when visiting friends and family in and around the Austin area. Just learned about this AZ location from one of my vendors at work and had to go check them out right away.

Texas BBQ is so much different than what you get in KS, NC, or other areas of this great nation. The big secret is that most of the flavors in TX come from the dry rubs and the hardwood that they use to smoke the meat. You do not need super sweet sauces to cover up this treasure. They use Oak here and it has a stronger flavor profile than many of the other tamer woods used at other places.

I'm a sucker for Brisket and always order some of the Moist cut. It has more fat and is my favorite. They also offer a Leaner cut for those watching their figure. The Jalapeno Sausage is also a special treat and you will surely see it on my plate. They also serve Pork, Ribs, Chicken, Turkey and several tasty sides to go with your meal. They even have Dessert.

Everything here is counter service and you basically walk up and order the meats by the pound. They have all the free fixins that you may need in a large area off to the side. You do not see that much out here. Brings back that good old TX feeling of being back home.

Don't forget to check out the really cool Country Store up front. They serve some very delicious Breakfast Tacos for less than two bucks during the morning rush. Get here early for lunch or at off times to avoid the large crowds. Small nap afterwards may be required. OH YEAH!

5 STARS"}
{"text":"Rudy's is a great spot for BBQ, especially if you like spicy! Their BBQ sauce is to die for. As is their brisket, smoked potatoes and green chile stew!"}
{"text":"Rudy's Arizona is as good as Rudy's Texas. Try the Breakfast Tacos, brisket & eggs, potatoes & beans or any other combo. Breakfast heaven!  Dinner is meat, meat, more meat and beans. Bar-b-que at its best."}
{"text":"Just ate a Rudy's in Chandler.  Best BarbQ ever!  Linda K"}
{"text":"It's not completely like back home (Tennessee) but it's dang close!  I ordered a stuffed potato (awesome price for what you get) with brisket.  It was awesome. My friend's pulled pork was already very sweet before any sauce.  Otherwise I'd give it five."}
{"text":"So disappointed in Rudy's to-go ordering. Called in an order at 4:49pm. Just a quart of cream corn and 2 regular whole sausage links. We're in a rush that's why we put in the order through the phone ahead of time. The guy said it will be ready in 15 minutes. Got there early at like 5pm. Waited, waited, waited....my husband said after 10 minutes the guy that took the order just said, oh he didn't even bring back our order yet. So thinking they would return with this small order in like another 5-10 minutes. Nope! It literally took them 38 minutes to get our two items together. What the heck. Wish we knew it was going to take 40 minutes for a to-go order, my husband would've just stood in the self order line and gotten it ourselves, that line was not too long. So bothered we had to experience something so unproductive and ineffective. A total inconvenience to very loyal customers."}
{"text":"Rudy's came up on Yelp as one of the highest great places to eat close to our hotel. I'm picky about my BBQ and it wasn't the best I've ever had but certainly some of the best BBQ I've had. The brisket moist was fabulous and their BBQ sauce is outstanding. Great atmosphere and the guy who waited on us was far and beyond the nicest person I've ever encountered at any eating establishment. He was so genuine and made sure we got just exactly what we wanted. I wish I remembered his name. I'd eat at Rudy's again and again."}
{"text":"Texas style BBQ!

I have been to Rudys in Colorado Springs and was so excited to see one in Arizona! 

I'm a big ban of the brisket, baby back ribs, smoked potato with meat, creamed corn and all of the deserts are amazing!"}
{"text":"I dig that they serve meat without sauce. BBQ is about MEAT! The atmosphere is decent, and they move the line pretty quick. I had the Cutter's Choice brisket ($6.19) and a side of Rudy's beans ($2), while my cohort had the pulled pork($5). The brisket was too dry for my taste, and the rub overpowered the smoke flavor. The quality of the meat was ok. The beans were almost all spice and no flavor, My friend's pulled pork was nice and smoky, but had a stringy texture, and was almost waterlogged. Neither of the \"sauses\" seemed to complement the meats, adding an unbalanced tartness to the food  For desert, I tried the peach cobbler, which was disapointing, as well, with what tasted like canned peaches, and a really soggy crust. For the money, there is better Q in town. Probably won't be back here"}
{"text":"This was our very first time here so we had no expectations. Customer service was pretty good, they let us sample the meats before we ordered. The place is super casual and there are signs to pick up after yourself. The ordering line reminds me of a theme park place where you order then take your seat. There are also no plates, or butter :( it's super casual so keep that in mind if you go. The food is decent but we probably won't return."}
{"text":"I dont usually care much for bbq spots. I find them to be usually overpriced and uninspired.  This place just seems to have bbq down to a science.  Furthermore my girlfriend and I filled up for 15 bucks! A definite must see for bbq lovers as well as foodies"}
{"text":"Rudy's seem to be a staple in most western states. We were looking for a different place to have breakfast. This place is just right! Not huge servings and still delicious. 

These guys ahead of us were talking about keeping their figures, so one mentioned getting a bowl. I listened in on the conversation to figure out what they were talking about. The bowl can be made up of anything you like. The plus side is not tortilla! Woo hoo! At home I could not, would not, do this because the tortilla was so good, but here, not so good and better for me! Brad ordered a brisket bowl and I ordered an egg and brisket bowl. What a treat! We brought, Jeb the next day for his own bowl as well. He had to eat outside, but it was early and not so hot that day! Great breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at the location in Leon Springs outside of San Antonio when I traveled for business.  I would return home to AZ and complain to my wife about how no one in the valley can even come close to what Rudy's does.

Well we finally have our own Rudy's.  I showed up on opening day and am happy to report that the brisket is as delicious as I remember it.  Great smoke flavor.  Jalapeno sausage and turkey are favorites too.  Lastly, the creamed corn is excellent - never had any this good anywhere.     

This will be the only place I go for BBQ in the valley - glad it is close.

Consider calling ahead and placing your order.  It is very busy."}
{"text":"Such great food!!! #DELICIOUSNESS

Shiner Beer and moist brisket, nothing more!! No collard greens or mac'n'cheese but still loved it.
I also tried some ribs which looked pink but still tasted good. No worries.

I would like to try some chicken next time. Four stars for now. Hopefully they continue with good prices and good customer service."}
{"text":"This is the place to get your grub on... you can even order to go!!!
The ribs are on point... And so are the sides of your choice... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There's no place more American nor Texan than Rudy's BBQ. It has such great character and is an excellent place to bring a group of friends or family. Besides the long line (which is only indicative of the deliciousness of this establishment's food), the service is friendly, the brisket is to die for (if you don't get the brisket, you are making a mistake), the Rudy's sauce is sublime, and the price is just right. Highly recommended for any time of the day!"}
{"text":"Love the moist brisket, Turkey and sweet tea.  The service is top notch and always welcoming.  We come here often."}
{"text":"This place was so good we decided to put this in our rotation of go to restaurants.  Very casual place, the first time we went there was a long line but it goes quick.  The highlight of the restaurant I would have to say is the moist brisket.  It is just so juicy and marbled every bite is just so tender.  For those of you who don't want all the extra fat there is also lean brisket and butchers choice (haven't had that one yet).  Anyways definitely try it out I don't think you will regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  I've been going to Rudys since they were on the side of the freeway in San Antonio. You have to know Texas BBQ to appreciate real smoked flavor. It may be an acquired taste for some but it is the most superior BBQ in the valley, IMO. Thanks for coming to town."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ, but only if you go during lunch. Food is much fresher at lunch and I've been served some freshly cut, steaming hot Brisket and Baby back ribs to die for. The fall off the bone goodness basically didn't even need any sauce it was that good. 

However, I've also come during dinner where quality fluctuates greatly. I've been served decent BBQ at best and dry BBQ at the worst. Even the baby back ribs at night have been much tougher/drier and turkey has lacked moisture almost to the point of feeling like eating hydrated jerky or something.

Overall, it's a great lunch joint, when food turnover is high and they're cranking out fresh food constantly. Dinner, I'd personally avoid. 

I've had most of their menu so far and I can recommend the following especially during lunch:
Brisket Lean
Turkey
Hot Links (Jalapeno, if you can handle actual spicy. If Tabasco is too much for you, don't bother trying)
Baby Back Ribs
Green Chile Stew

Haven't tried their prime rib yet among some other stuff, but I've almost had everything else. I'm not a big fan of their refrigerated stuff like coleslaw as they have a bunch of styrofoam cups prefilled with food and based on what I've tried it isn't very fresh to me.

Sauces wise they have their standard and a Sissy sauce. Both taste really similar to me and neither of them are very spicy, just more of the standard sweet BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed in this place.

After finally getting a BBQ joint on the West Side, I was excited to try Rudy's... and then we got it today at work for lunch and it was extremely blase.  Nothing to write to mom about, everything was boring.  And the \"Texas toast\" we were told about by the girl at the front counter - was a loaf of white bread.  Seriously?!  

Maybe eating in would yield a better experience, but right now I'm not impressed and highly doubtful."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Arizona. Highly recommend lean brisket, all breakfast tacos, and all sides. Chili is great if you like spice. Potato salad and creamed corn are always a must. Cobbler is great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I hate this place! !! Only because we love it so much. We always end up in trouble when we go there cause we just want to eat everything, and we pretty much do. There's a BBQ place right across from them and their stuff isn't cut right fresh in front of you and was a little dry, so this is the best BBQ place for us."}
{"text":"Staff was incredible!! Great service, suggestions and help. Food was just ok. Dry. Not a big fan of BBQ sauce and the bread was pathetic.. loaf of bread from grocery store and you get slices"}
{"text":"Everyone knows about Rudy's, but a lot of people don't know they are open for breakfast at 7 AM.  They have rows of prepared breakfast tacos, no waiting at all.  Just grab the ones you want, pay, and eat there or take it with you.  They have brisket tacos, jalapeno sausage tacos, plus the regulars like sausage/bacon and even fresh green and red salsa to add.  The flour tortillas stay soft and warm and melt into the taste of the meats."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit. Was in town for business, and coworkers recommended this place. It's definitely popular, and I can see why. Staff were super friendly and very generous with samples for new visitors. I love the SW take on the BBQ; the pulled pork was tossed in their homemade green chile sauce. I only tried that, and a sample of the brisket, but I thought it was all excellent, and would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in a long time! Meat is cooked to perfection, sides are delicious and atmosphere is fun. Ribs fall off the bone and are full of flavor, brisket literally melts in your mouth. Excellent place!!"}
{"text":"I heard Rudys was a good place to eat. So I came in for lunch and the young man who took my order was rude. He had a big mouth full of chewing tobacco which was disgusting especially working around food!!! I can tell he had little to no respect to LEO's. For the price I paid I expected the food to be better but at least I should have had better customer service. I would not recommend this place eapecially to anyone in a uniform both Military and LEO."}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving by and decided to stop in for some quick dinner, we didn't know what to expect.
   When it was our turn to order we told the cashier we had never eaten here before and she grabbed us some samples and we were very impressed and even changed our minds on a couple items. This was a great selling feature!
   We purchased the Moist Brisket, Turkey, Jalapeno Sausage, Pulled Pork, Creamed Corn, Potato Salad & Cole Slaw...everything was very good! And of course we had left overs. The total price was affordable and we will definitely return again! I suggest you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday for the first time and I love this place!! the Brisket is out of this world. they give you samples to taste so you know what your getting before you order!! over all a great time!!!"}
{"text":"BREAKFAST TACOS!!!!!!!!!!   I'm from Austin, Texas so I'm jacked that Rudy's is now Chandler!  I'm a big fan of Texas style BBQ and haven't found BBQ in Phoenix that compares.   This Rudy's store is basically the same as those found in Texas but there's no gas station.   The store theme is no-frills \"country\",  the seating is picnic tables.   Wait in line, order at the counter and buy the meats by the pound.   You can order whatever weight you want, so don't feel like you have to buy a whole pound.   I like to get a 1/4 pound lean brisket and 1/4 pound turkey and a side.   You have your choice of complimentary white or wheat bread slices, just tell them how many slices you need.  Your food is placed on butcher's paper (not plates) and is set in a big plastic crate which you take to your table.   Two types of BBQ sauce are located on the tables in large bottles with a shaker top.   The sauce is a peppery ketchup based product.   There's also a condiment bar with pickles, onions, peppers if you want them.   When you're done eating there's a big hand washing station with a metal trough under it (don't accidentally mistake this for a stadium urinal!)    

This AZ store has a several new menu additions that I've never seen in the Austin stores:  pulled pork, sandwiches, cobbler, 3 bean salad, and baked potato.    I tried the pulled pork and loved it.   

Oh and here's the BIG kicker:  BREAKFAST TACOS in the a.m.!!!!!!    I've sorely missed my beloved breakfast tacos.  Anyone from Texas knows what I'm talking about.    Why the heck nobody does breakfast tacos outside of Texas I'll never understand.  Phoenix just got a little better."}
{"text":"Tried it last Thursday . The brisket was juicy and moist. They had plenty of condiments including jalape√±os.  The sauce was not too sweet or tangy . Price was reasonable.  Cold slaw was average"}
{"text":"My family has been to Rudy's on a few occasions and I have to say except for a few items. And we have been to many BBQ places around the country. Rudy's has to be the most over priced,  over rated BBQ in the country!!! By the time you order and wait for them to chop up everything, go sit down, get your drinks, napkins, condiments and finally sit down everything is cold at best.  And then to charge by the pound for BBQ that is not very good! Wow! I am shocked they are still in business!  Now, I will admit to being some what spoiled coming from a BBQ city, but come on! Needless we will NOT be going back to Rudy's ever!"}
{"text":"Came to town and had no idea where to grab a bite for dinner before checking into out hotel.  Read the reviews for Rudy's and gave it a shot.  This place is really good!  Got the moist brisket and it was so delicious!  The hubbs also got the jalape√±o sausage and said it was great!  The potato salad was yummy and had a lot of flavor.  The original sauce was really spicy for me but I'm a bit of a lightweight, so I used the sissy sauce.  Quite honestly, I only dipped the brisket in sauce a couple times because it was so fabulous even without it.  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"To a California girl in for the weekend this place was amazing!! The meat was smoked and cooked perfectly. My friend recommended it, said that these establishments are also in Texas, so that has to be a good thing. 
I would recommend you get two varieties of meats. 
You'll need a team to go with you in case there are seats to be saved. Seats are as you imagine in TV, long tables where you are elbow to elbow with your neighbor and they could be strangers. 

Bring wet naps for after, because you'll want to use your hands."}
{"text":"I prefer not to eat my prime rib wrapped in paper with plastic forks & knives... Refill on drinks are not an option, unless you get up for it... No kids menu... AND you have to clean you soaked through \"paper\" mess up yourself when you are done.. That's what the milk crate is for... For the price and taste I will go to Famous Dave's or try the new smokin BBQ next door... BTW - there was a hair in my brisket... Dinner for family of 4... Over $50... - best part, I didn't have to leave a tip!!  won't be back! Good luck!"}
{"text":"Get the brisket!!! So moist and delicious! I also really liked the spicy sausage. Definitely go here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"When I miss Texas BBQ, Rudy's is where I go to get my fix. 

They serve all the meats by weight, so you can order as many or as few. This is great so you can try out a good variety of the bbq meats.  They have a good amount of different things they smoke here, but my favorite is the moist brisket and the prime rib. 

Nothing needs a lot of sauce as the smoky meat flavor is in all the meats. I like to have the prime rib with just a tad bit of salt/pepper. 

They service two types of brisket here, lean and moist. I would always recommend the moist as that's the most marbled and tasty. 

Lastly, grab some blue bell ice cream and some rice crispy's on the way out!"}
{"text":"I agree with the positive reviews of this good barbeque joint. Fast, efficient, casual, nicely priced and very good and authentic Texas beef brisket. I opted for the \"moist\" brisket and It was some of the best brisket I've enjoyed. Sauce selections on the picnic-style tables made adding the quality of sauce - or no sauce - totally up to me. Nice friendly service was also a plus. The only down side is that they, like most bbq places, do not serve green salads or low-card sides."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally had a chance to try this place and we were not impressed. I had the brisket sandwich and he had the pulled pork. The meat was good, flavorful and very tender. The sides were just plain, new potatoes were just boiled with butter and salt and the cole slaw was nothing special. I expected the sauces to be amazing but I prefer Famous Daves all the way."}
{"text":"Green Chili Stew and Smoked Turkey are outstanding along with everything else here...except the lean brisket...unless you're in to that kind if thing. Fat is flavor baby! Spicey Chop is very good too and the potato salad is better than expected."}
{"text":"Really can't say anything negative about his place. The process is really fast with your order prepared and delivered to you while you're paying at the counter. Then you grub on paper sheets and wrap it all up and throw away. This makes for more attention of the staff working on getting you some fine tasting BBQ very quick. Loved the green chili stew!! Will definitely be back and recommend."}
{"text":"All of the meat is bland, even with their watered down bbq sauce. Speaking of bbq sauce the only choices you have is vinegar & spicy vinegar.

The chicken was too boney, most of my bites had a hidden bone in it. Which is something I'm sure we can all agree that it's unpleasant to chew your food & then SURPRISE you have bone shards in your mouth.

There are no \"to go\" boxes, you have to wrap your meat in a brown paper bag. Some restaurants do their own thing that makes them cool, but no... meat sliding around in a bag doesn't sound clean or secure.

I must say the quality of customer service was top notch, they were friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"1st time at this location but have been to the El Paso, TX  Rudy's several times. Thier brisket and  jalepe√±o sausage is phenomenal. The Brisket is smoky, super tender, with no sauce needed. Even the plain white bread tastes better here. Service is fast. Place is clean."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ.  Will definitely come back here again and again.  We had the Pork Loin and Turkey (1/2 pound of each) and my husband and I split both meats.  We also had Rudy's Beans (wonderful) and my husband had the Cole Slaw (it was just OK), but the beans were very tasty.  Our son and daughter-in-law had the Moist Brisket and they said that it melted in your mouth.  We are all definitely planning on going there again and again.  If you want some real Texas BBQ, check this place out.  If you are a first timer, they will give you a sample of any of the meats to try before you order.  It is all priced by the half pound, but you can order as much as you want and they will charge you accordingly.  Most of the meats are like $6.49 for 1/2 pound of the most wonderful, tender meats that you can imagine.  They serve bread, which is complimentary, if you want it.  Their sauces are great.  We loved the Sissy Sauce and bought some to bring home.  Even their original sauce was good.  Banana pudding was pretty tasty too, as we got some for our grandson.  Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Baby Back ribs didn't tatse smoked or grilled at all! Tasted like they cooked them in an oven. The skin was soggy aka no crust on the outside of the ribs! Disappointing. Beans were good. Creamed corn was amazing. Sausage was excellent. They have to get the ribs together."}
{"text":"I revisited this location on 3/22/2013. For a really low cost lunch, this is A-OK. I've found what I like here and it's the Turkey.

Fresh cut white meat turkey on a bun--rye bread would be better but to keep the cost down, they only offer something close to a hamburger bun. .l also had the small potato salad and a diet coke. 

For those who are dining here the first time--the ordering line is long during peak hours. No plates and every item ordered arrives in a tray. Once you get your tray, turn right to the soda machine and condiments. Everything needed can be found here. 

As far a \"Real Texas BBQ\", don't expect that here due to the low prices. It is what it is!"}
{"text":"Food is good, you can Taste the slow smokeyness of the wood they use to slow roast the meat. The right amount of smoke ring, the right amount of char and the right amount of flavor. It is tasty... So why only a 4* review?! The coleslaw had no flavor but the tater salad was the bomb. I like mustard style potato salad. The sauce had a slight kick but nothing to crazy. I paid $13 for a brisket sammich, LG drink, 6oz tater salad and 6oz slaw. But all in all it's good. I willbe back :)"}
{"text":"Had a corporate lunch catered. Brisket and pulled pork. Flavor is ok but the meat got cold and hard quickly. I would recommend unless it's the las Bbq spot to go too.

I have a pic where my fork broke into pieces because it wasn't tender..."}
{"text":"Wired place.

You get your food in a coke bottle tray and eat on wax paper placed on the table.
Definitely not fine dining. 
Eating out of a trough might be prettier.

Also not suitable for small portions since you have to order each item separately.
They don't offer any combos."}
{"text":"Best barbecue in town... If I'm anywhere near either of their restaurants I definitely stop ...no matter what!!! Their brisket moist is amazing! I am drooling right now just thinking about it LOL! 
My other top choices are the ribs, the cream corn is to die for, and of course you have to have peach cobbler!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in and out of TX. Brisket and cream corn are the best things on the menu and, when available, the Prime Rib is awesome. For us it's worth the 90 min drive."}
{"text":"First meal of the day upon arrival in AZ. I ordered baby back ribs while hubby and son opted for briskets. Yummy and quite moist. They are quite organized. I'd recommend for sure :)"}
{"text":"Greatest bar b q.  The moist brisket is to die for.  Cream of corn delicious. The red potatoes were so so. But overall the best in Arizona.  Can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu"}
{"text":"Rudy's is probably some of the best BBQ here in Arizona. The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars from me is that there have been a couple times that the brisket wasn't quite right and the cashiers seem to have a habit of not listening very well to an order. Other than those two minor issues, this place is definitely worth the trip. 

Oh...and can't forget the breakfast tacos...so goooood."}
{"text":"Arizona is like the red headed stepchild to the BBQ industry.  Open a new restaraunt and people will stand in lines for hours and pay rediculous prices like $6 bucks for a half pound of meat.  You must be high, for the price you just paid to eat at Rudy's you could have bought your own smoker and 10 pounds of Pork Butt..  Rudy's prices are outrageous, if this place actually smoked their own meat and had a guy tending a smoker all night long I would go back.  But no I digress, all their meat is already cooked and shipped in.  They just warm it up and sell it to you for 6 - 9 dollars a HALF POUND.  LOL Suckers."}
{"text":"I first discovered Rudy's back in 2006 when I was working in Texas.  Great BBQ at a gas station?!?!?!   Sign me up!!  I can multi-task.  Well, the location in Chandler doesn't have a gas station, which is fine with me.  I love the employees here.  They put up with all kinds of nonsense from oblivious customers and are always friendly and upbeat.  

What it does have is some delicious smoked meat.  And very cold beers.  I think there are some sides, but I can't remember them because we go full-on carnivore when we eat there.  

I swung in today during my least favorite time of day, the noon hour, but I was in the area, so I thought I'd get some brisket and sausage to go with some delicious smoked gouda I have at home.

The line was almost to the door, which is to be expected, but then I realized that near the front was a group of almost a dozen people, all together, clogging up the works.  

My version of this morning's meeting:

\"Where should we have lunch?\"

11 voices chime in \"RUDY'S!!!!\"  1 voice squeaks out, \"Whataburger.\"

\"OK.  Rudy's it is.  Should we have them cater?\"

\"NO!!!\"

\"Should we call ahead?\"  

\"NO!!!\"

\"Should we look at the menu ahead of time and figure out our orders so only one or two people are at the register?\"

\"HELL NO!!\"

\"Should we all go up to the register together, order separately, take all the time in the world, and clog the works up for everybody else?\"

\"YES!!!  Screw those assholes!\"

I think some of that jagoffery I experienced in Nebraska followed me home.

There was some evidence of jagoffery in the parking lot too with a gray pickup and small trailer for a solar panel business taking up FOUR spots during the lunch hour.  Could have done with two.  Nope.  I'm taking four.  

Jagoff."}
{"text":"Stop by today after finding this place out on a motorcycle ride was not disappointed, when the staff found out it was our first time there they took the time to explain the menu to us and even gave us some samples to taste. Long story short the brisket was amazing will definitely return."}
{"text":"It was not that awesome, disappointing in fact. They don't have much to choose from. I wanted a pulled chicken sandwich but nope not on their menu so I ended up with a lame brisket sandwich instead it was pretty tender but the flavor was lacking.  I was also a bit saddened that there was no mac n' cheese, yes you read right no mac n' cheese :(.  There BBQ sauces left much to be desired.  But thank goodness for the pecan pie that saved the day, it was pretty delicious and the only edible thing that I ordered that I really liked.  The staff was pretty friendly too. 

PS I don't like the setup of having to order first in a line and then wondering where I am going to sit, I always feel rushed when having to do so, but other than that it had a pretty good atmosphere ."}
{"text":"Went there on July 15, my first time there. Atmosphere was very relaxed. Food wasn't very good. Ordered the baby back ribs. They were Salty and cold. Also ordered some carved turkey and a small cup of chili.  Turkey was ok, the chili was the best part of the meal.  It was actually good. The worst part of my visit was the price.  Almost 30 dollars for eight baby back ribs, 4 small slices of turkey, a small cup of chili (approximately 4 ounces, I think) and 2 small re fillable soft drinks!"}
{"text":"Simply one of the better BBQ joints I've ever visited.  Great service at the counter, free samples, and the food....delicious.  The BEST brisket I've ever had.  I'd also recommend the peach cobbler to wash it all down.  You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is probably the best BBQ I've ever had in my life. The moist brisket was the best I've ever had. The ribs are so good. The turkey and spicy chop was also great. Ohhhhh don't pass on the beans and try their BBQ sauce. They are awesome."}
{"text":"Very confusing when you walk in. A bit overwhelming. Perhaps big arrows telling you where to go or foot steps on the ground to show a path of how to get in line????
Food good, bit pricey. Cafeteria style dining."}
{"text":"Coming from TX, we know Rudy's. But, have to say the Chandler location was even better than those in Houston. Not an avid fan, but was definitely better.

Line was ridiculous to get in, my guess, something knew = novelty. People were nice, outside area was quiet and spacious. 

Food = we sampled the brisket and we ordered the pulled pork. Definitely agree with the reviews, very peppery on the pork, but not fatty. Would get the brisket if we go back. My husband and our friends got the loaded baked potato with meat on top, they rated it better than Joe's BBQ, which says a lot. 

I just had the 1/2 lb pork in a tub. Why only 3 stars? Not a fan of the sauce, and without it, meat was just ok. Is more vingary and peppery than sweet. Would I get to go or go back again, probably, but bring my own 'sause'. And, had to add more sugar to the 'sweet tea'. Nix on the coleslaw - no taste.

Overall, good not stellar, but good. TX Roadhouse still has the best pulled pork around if you like it sweet."}
{"text":"Just like I remember it from my days living in DALLAS! 

My fiance and I showed up on a Saturday night to a line out the door, which took us about 35 minutes to get through, but that wasn't a big deal, so we waited and enjoyed dinner. 

We had Pulled pork sandwiches - A+ Excellent, cooked to perfection and full of flavor

New Potatoes smothered in butter - Absolutely amazing (just like i remembered) probably going to lead to a heart attack

Coleslaw - Not sure, but the fiance said it was amazing

Creamed corn - very tasty and sweet

We each had a beer from the large selection on hand.

Overall it was a great dinner and only $30 


Also, the dining style is basic and makes you feel welcome and free to get messy with the sauces."}
{"text":"Did not like the BBQ sauce or their potato salad, don't know why it was so sweet! BBQ sauce was horrible, no real flavor! We had baby backs, nice they were cut but we're dry, dry dry! The cream corn was good and hubby liked the beans! If we go back will try something else, not crazy about how food is served or tables to eat at, if it was cheaper may put up with that but not at those prices!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ joint! The half chicken meal was so tender and moist! The pulled pork sandwich was DELICIOUS without even the sauce! The sauce makes it even better!! The potato salad tastes homemade and so fresh! They greeted us at the door and walked us through ordering since it was our first time! I can tell why the locals love it! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos and peach cobbler. We love it after a good hike. Need to be there by 10am tho to get the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"After eating at Rudy's a few times decided to hold my son's birthday party there. We were given a private room in the restaurant. The food of course was the centerpiece. We had a buffet set up with 3 different meats, 3 sides, bread, soda all for about $10/person with service included! What a steal! The food was terrific. The hosts were attentive. Overall great experience. Highly recommend Rudy's!!"}
{"text":"We drove down to Goodyear to intercept family members on a trip from Galveston, TX to San Diego, CA and were looking for a good restaurant to meet them at... We decided on Rudy's on a lark, not knowing the first thing about the place. 

What a stroke of luck. First off, it's not a fancy place. It's a bunch of tables placed end to end and you sit where you find a place, next to whomever got there before you, or at 6 man picnic tables in an adjacent wing.

The place is fairly large, and has a down-home feel to it. That mouthwatering, smokey BBQ \"smell\" just wafts all over the place and just beckons you in. The meat specialties are sold by the sandwich or by the pound. You order at the register, your food is weighed and fixed right in front of you, and given to you on the spot in a large tray that more closely resembled a small crate.

We had 6 in our group, and ordered a pound of the \"moist brisket\",  2 hot sausages, and 2 meat stuffed & loaded potatoes, along with a brisket sandwich and a chopped beef sandwich. We topped off with a quart of coleslaw, a quart of potato salad, and sodas to wash it all down with. 

Loved the casual atmosphere and the BBQ was as good as any I ever had in Texas. In a word, sensational. The salads were excellent, as were the sausages and stuffed potatoes. We all left so full, there was no room for dessert, and the bill came to about $12 a person... Can't beat that with a stick. 

A definite do-over!"}
{"text":"I was so hopeful to find a good BBQ place. I heard great things about this place but wanted to wait until the lines went down from it being new. Well, I am so sad. Shared a brisket and a turkey sandwich along with sides of coleslaw, potato salad and a cobbler with my mom. 
There was a really bad propane taste to the turkey.  The brisket was ok. Not anything to rave about. The BBQ sauce you add yourself at the table, which the spouts were clogged.  
Now I really thought that they would have some good potato salad and coleslaw being a BBQ place. I was very wrong.  Not homemade.  Tasted like any store bought deli products.  Ewe. 
I guess that I had high hopes for the cobbler. Was kinda scared to try it after the salads. Yep disappointed.  I have actually had better frozen store bought. 
I hate to do a bad review but really if the food was better I'd totally give it a great review.  I think the whole concept they have is cool and the decorations are totally western BBQ cool. Even the patio for when it cools down would be great.  But you don't go there for the decorations."}
{"text":"First time to a Rudy's. Will it be my last probably not.   The girl at the entrance knew was my first time and gave me guidance on how ordering works. I've got to say i like the prices, other bbq places will charge you same for half the meat. However those places are authentic and 5 star worthy.

Why 3 stars? Got 1/2 lb of moist brisket and pork ribs. Ribs were not good at all, very little smoke and and lacked flavor, to me that was biggest disappointment. The brisket was super moist and because of the fat and tenderness it was flavorful but again almost no smoke flavor. You could load it with bbq sauce but the sauces are not that tasty so I had to settle for a hot sauce they had there. It makes me think that if i had gotten the lean brisket i would probably had not liked it as the moist was good because of the fat.

Maybe i didn't notice but theres no white bread to go with your meat, so you will rely on the condiments and sides to accompany the meat.

If its your first time stick with the moist brisket."}
{"text":"Nothing like Texas Bar-B-Q to start a great weekend. Lots of meat for their sandwiches. The generous helpings of lean brisket were the perfect match to an ice cold beer. best Bar-B-Q in town. Homestyle bench sitting. Busy during lunch and dinner but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Good - I love the deli style way they sell meat. You walk in and if its your first time they give you samples. They do rush you a little but hey, its a business so I can let that slide. I also like the hand washing trough outside the bathroom for cleaning up after ribs. The moist brisket was pretty good overall, good flavor and texture, minus a very smoky flavor you come to expect from bbq. 

The Bad - Pork ribs, terrible. No bark at all, only a few flakes of pepper on the outside. The meat was under done, still pink, and fairly tough to tear away from the bone. In fact it did not tear away very well at all. Then there was the problem that the ribs really had no real flavor at all. Any trace of smoke flavor was non existent, they tasted under boiled and them exposed to a little grilling for some small but meaningless char. BBQ sauce on the table was likewise horrible. The non spicy one tastes like ketchup with a few herbs in it, the hot one tasted like they added a little tabasco to the first one. 

Overall I love the concept and some of their food. When you charge the prices they do and make the claims they make about their food, they have set the bar themselves. The brisket was the only thing really keeping them from a 1 star review. Very nice people, great business model, but unfortunately, overall, the food just does not seem to be worth it."}
{"text":"Oh my, yes. I've been craving some good barbecue lately, and this hit the spot. I had the moist brisket and the pork loin with the original sauce and a big ol' ear of sweet buttery corn. The meat was moist and flavorful, the sauce was a great blend of sweet and hot. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Employees rude when ordering. Brisket cut with zero bark. No flavor. There's a right way to smoke and cut a brisket and this isn't it."}
{"text":"My family and I visited last night. I give this restaurant 3.5 stars. We ordered the pulled pork (1/2lb), moist brisket (1/2lb), sausage, sandwich rolls on the side ($0.25), and a potato salad and a coleslaw. I found the cleanliness and the orderliness of the space great. Everything was clean and well stocked. We have 2 adults and 4 kids, so we probably could have ordered a bit more food. The 1/2 lb of pulled pork is about 2- 1/4 cup servings. The pork was good, but seemed to have onions and vinegar seasoning to it. I really just wanted a big pile of moist pork to sauce up. The moist brisket had great smoke flavor, but had quite a bit of fat on it (we will order the lean brisket next time) and was not pull apart tender. It was actually quite chewy and tough. The sausage was spiced well and cooked perfectly. It was surprisingly my favorite item we ordered. Both the salads were well flavored and seemed nice and fresh. We will definitely go back and try a few more items and give the lean brisket a try. We all really loved the sauce and smoke on the food. We also loved sitting on the patio while the weather is so nice.

**apparently you can get sliced bread with your meats for no charge! but when I asked if they sold rolls to go with the meats this wasn't mentioned to me, even while spending $35 on dinner. Somewhat of a disappointment. The rolls were warm and buttered and toasted, so it was worth the money this time. (Maybe free bread for the kiddos next time :) We also weren't asked if this was our first time or given any help while staring up at the menu for a few minutes looking perplexed."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and healthy protein. We went on a nearby hike and found this."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ.  I had the moist brisket, creamed corn and potato salad.  The brisket had a nice, smoked flavor, was tender and somewhat juicy.  It had a good bark on it, too.  I tried a taste of their two BBQ sauces and didn't really care for them.  That's just me, though, because I like mine a sweet, Tennessee style sauce.  Ultimately, the meat should stand alone without the help of sauce.  No sauce was needed.  The creamed corn was really good -- sweet and yummy.  It really complimented the savory flavor of the meat.  The potato salad...not so much.  It's completely commercial tasting.  I didn't realize it until my hubby sat it down and saw it's shipped in from New Braunfels, TX (very close to the BBQ capital of Lockhart).  I will skip that one next time.  They do not have a kids menu, which was disappointing but not a deal breaker.  We did fine with the offerings.  They had turkey, which was very good.  Moist, tender and well seasoned -- they ate it up.  My older son had the corn on the cob -- devoured -- and my youngest had the baked potato (made my own mashed with some butter).  The potato is expensive, but nice sized, that comes topped with butter sour cream and shredded cheese.  My hubby had the brisket, corn and sausage.  He said the sausage was good and flavorful.
Line was out the door and waited about 30 mins.  Love the picnic style seating (real BBQ style) with all your drinks, eating utensils, etc serve yourself.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"The breakfast tacos are the only thing I've had hear, but if everything else is just as good, then wow! They are delicious and a great deal!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to stop into Rudy's and try their famous BBQ and I was not disappointed my friends. My coworker and I took other Yelper's advice and got there early (10:45) for a Friday lunch. By the time we left the line was to the door. I got 1/2 lb of moist brisket, potato salad and a root beer. The moist brisket was the best brisket that I have ever had. It just melts in your mouth and the crispy burnt ends are so flavorful with just the right amount of smoke and rub. The rudy's sauce compliments the meat perfectly. I love how the regular sauce is spicy and the mild sauce is \"Sissy\". BBQ sauce should have a nice kick to it. the potato salad tastes like good homemade potato salad. Nothing crazy cause it don't need to be when it's good. I couldn't leave without buying some of their sauce and dry rub to try on a pork butt this weekend. i will be coming back to Rudy's for another round soon. It's legit BBQ!"}
{"text":"Went here with my brother and I must for my first time going here the food was really good 

We ordered the moist pork turkey and ribs the prices were reasonable the place was busy 

The banana pudding is really good too 

The total bill for both was around 28 dollars not bad for good food

I will go back for more in the future"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've had. Ordered both types of brisket. The leaner brisket was still very moist. Beans were delicious. The corn was sweet and the kernels were basically falling off the cobb. I will definitely be back. 

Picnic type of seating/decor"}
{"text":"Our first time here and we won't be back. The brisket was overpowered by the taste of whatever fuel they used to BBQ. My husband loves BBQ but he had to throw most of the meat out. Their prices were over inflated for the amount and quality of food provided. To top it off, there was no kids menu.  We'll be sticking with Joe's Barbecue or even Famous Daves."}
{"text":"Its reasonable here.  The prices are okay for the quality of food you get and this was my first time coming here so ordering was a little different but its not my first restaurant ordering that way.  When you walk in you pass the first ordering window to get in line to order your food and seat yourself which is more convenient with getting your food the minute you order instead of waiting.  Everything is ordered separately meat sides and drink.  As for the barbeque sauce a lot of people were using the sissy sauce i prefer the other one its less sweet but just my preference.  I would like to see more sides on the menu and then maybe a cornbread instead of just regular slices of bread.  I will probably come here again but i am still searching for really good barbeque."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and amazing food! The spicy chop is my favorite but I've tried just about everything on the menu and loved them all! Even more than the food, I love the atmosphere, both my husband and I are from the south and something about Rudy's always puts us in good spirits when we are home sick! Also great place to bring kids (assuming they aren't too picky) because it's already loud so you don't have to worry as much about your own children's noise level. 

We have also had Rudy's cater a birthday party, they did give us the wrong order initially but where extremely apologetic and made it more than eighth with their actions."}
{"text":"I am from Texas and Rudy's is real Texas BBQ. Real Texas BBQ is about delicious smoked meat. Brisket rules as well as ribs. Moist juicy and with a bit of fat on the brisket please. It is not about the sauces. Real Texas BBQ stands on its own, with sauce served on the side to add if you desire. So for all the yelpers that are whining about the sauce, please go to Kansas City where they cover up their BBQ in sauce. Do not eat here this place is not for you. Real Texas BBQ is not hidden or masked with BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"If you like real Down Home BBQ, good ole Southern Flare then this is NOT the place for you. I got so Mad thinking I hit the Jackpot in good ole country boy BBQ   The Brisket was tough the Ribs were fatty  the Sauce taste like BBQ/Spaghetti sauce. If you go here and never ever ever had good real BBQ then you might just like it...  If you are above the Mason Dixon Line... then you might like it...."}
{"text":"Definitely 5 star BBQ!!! 
We went to Joes based on local recommendations but it was sub par and dry... The meat wasn't moist and juicy... 
Rudy's BBQ was outstanding!! We had to drive out of our way to get there and our whole softball team showed up and everybody loved it!! 
Even my buddy... We are from NorCal and guys had to admit it was better than our hometown favorite Everett & Jones!!! 
I'm looking forward to our next trip out this way... Just to come back to Rudy's!!!"}
{"text":"My bf had the ribs they was absolutely dreadful, really hard and wasn't even edible. I had the pulled pork it was so so. The bar was nicely stocked...I'm definitely not a fan of the place at all, if you like fold up chairs and lunch room like places I guess it could be nice? I'm from the real country east coast and this place was just way to uncomfortable for me to want to be at."}
{"text":"First visit.
Early lunch.11:00AM on a Thursday.
Sampled Moist and Regular Brisket and smoked turkey.
Ordered moist brisket sandwich, slaw & potato salad.
The brisket was moist. They do it right. Melts in your mouth and you can basically chew it with your tongue.Smoky pork goodness galore!
The slaw was ..meh. No tang, mostly cabbage in a bland watery sauce.
The potato salad was good. Nothing to write home about, but it had a good tang to it and was not off-putting.
Free drink refills. Large gets you a big plastic cup that you can bring back in for $.75 refills. 
I drove from north Phoenix to met a friend for lunch on my day off and I would say it was worth the trip.
My buddy had the beans, which he stated in his review, were bland. Even after doctoring them up with BBQ sauce.

Would have been 5 start except for the mediocre sides."}
{"text":"Turkey and moist brisket are amazing. This was about 35 miles from my house and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing smoked turkey, little disappointed at no cornbread, but everything else was awesome. Ask for samples :)"}
{"text":"Overall pretty cool place to go. The BBQ is good and if it's your first time there they give you a sample of the meat. When you walk in you will see these huge tubs of ice with drinks (beers,soda). They also have fountain drinks as well. 
The meat is good too. I was not a fan of the moist brisket. But the lean brisket, turkey and something else that involved brisket was good. Would def go back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Being from Texas this is my go to place for barbecue. The jumbo potatoes are awesome."}
{"text":"OMFG - I'm so glad I don't live by this place otherwise I think I'd DIE from overeating their good food. I used to drive up from Tucson to get their food, but now I live in the area so I can enjoy their moist, tender, delicious, tastey barbecue WHENEVER I want."}
{"text":"Fun location and good BBQ choices to satisfy your cravings.  
Ask for samples if you aren't sure.  The moist brisket was my favorite.   Def great for small or large groups."}
{"text":"Stopped to try this new restaurant. Was not overly impressed with the food quality. With the large number of BBQ establishments in town the quality is a must to draw a portion of the local food market. The pork was tough. Maybe this was a bad day will need to try again to see if this a regular occurrence or the norm.  Service was good. Prices were competitive with other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Fun place with really good food.  For me, it's all about the side dishes. I gotta tell you--the coleslaw, potato salad, and cream corn were DELISH. I had a turkey sandwich and it was so tender and juicy. We all enjoyed ribs, the regular and jalape√±o sausage, and pulled pork. All were flavorful, tender and not overwhelmed on the sauces. The service was polite, friendly, and helpful to us as newcomers. The only drawback I felt necessary to mention is that there are a lot of flies. I realize it's built as an old gas station with the roll down doors, but there's gotta be a way to reduce the number of flies in the place. 

We will go back when the weather is cooler...and there are fewer flies."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best BBQ in the valley. I typically get the brisket (extra moist) with ribs and potato salad. Everything is fantastic! If you're looking for a first date place, this isn't it. You order food by the pound and they provide free bread to soak up all the yummy juices and sauces. Picnic table seating only so be sure to make friends with your neighbors.  If you don't like the heat, try the sissy sauce. Highly recommend Rudy's~"}
{"text":"It was good brisket but not great. I am born and raised Texas so maybe standards are to high. Extremely noisy feel and wasnt fan of seating. Might come back but seemed high for what you got."}
{"text":"Be sure to stop here to experience the best brisket and jalapeno sausage ever. Cafeteria style line makes getting your food really quick. The only draw back here was the sliced white and wheat bread -some homemade rolls would make the experience better. A lot of happy people in this place-adults and children. Workers are very pleasant and helpful as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tl;dr - bbq meat by the pound. No frills. Good stuff.

We stumbled into this place last night after driving by several times. 

The decor is rustic like a country fair. You order by the pound and get your sides or fixins further down the line, cafeteria style.

Grab some paper for a place mat, Sit at long picnic tables on metal chairs with your box of grub.

For two of us it was $40, so it ain't cheap, but if you want your texas BBQ fix, this place will surely satisfy.

I had 1/2 pound of brisket ( $6.99 ) which was super yummy and smokey, they have 3 kinds of beef brisket. Sorta dry, mushy, or cutters choice. I did choice. As someone who knows good brisket, it was done right.

Wifey ordered babyback ribs ( $7.99 x 2 ) cooked perfect for me though perhaps a bit under for her tastes, still darn good. I was fortunate to share ;)

Sides were $3.99 each, a green chili stew (whew spicey goodness with celery, tomatoes, chili's, and such) and potato salad (fairly basic Costco style though no complaints). They have bread and sauces, peppers and more in the salad bar looking area.

Drinks were a wide nice variety of local or commercial beers for $3.50 each (lots of shiner beer, I dunno why), you could get a bucket of ice to stick em in too), sweet tea, not sweet tea, sodas, etc. No glasses, no plates, this is real eatin with none of that sissy foofoo. OK they do have sissy sauce for people who can't handle the spice, though I digress...

TV's all around with sports on display and seating outside for those that want it ;) mind the roll up garage doors.

Plentiful parking in their own lot with easy in and out to the street.

Ordering is in a line, you tell them what you want, get it, then sit down wherever. They also do catering.

I hear they are known for massive baked potatoes with all kinds of trimmings, though I didn't get any of that this round.

A place to bring your out of towners or locals who crave good BBQ in a casual setting."}
{"text":"Well....the chocolate pudding was good!  

This place has a lot of hype surrounding it and despite being an enormous fan of the Austin style BBQ joint in Phoenix, Little Miss BBQ (see my review and all the other 5-star reviews surrounding it), I was willing to give it a shot.  

The line didn't bug me and I was ready to wait knowing this is how Texas style BBQ is, but just know you will wait a bit because of the way they slice and serve their food.  My hubby and two friends and I grabbed one of the metal buckets and filled it with yeasty beverages while we waited.  

Let me just preface this entire review now (as if the first sentence didn't already cover it)...I have two simple words to describe it.  Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland.  Does that about cover it?

We decided on half a pound each of the pork spare ribs, fatty brisket, and one house made jalapeno sausage along with some coleslaw, beans, and chocolate pudding.  The coleslaw was insanely bland.  What am I talking about?!  The entire tray of meat was everything but flavorful.  

As soon as they put the ribs on our tray, I turned to my husband and asked him, \"What the heck is that?\"  It was gray and looked like cardboard.  The fatty brisket they laid down was a lousy excuse for fatty brisket.  As a brisket expert, my husband realized their \"fatty brisket\" is actually the lower part of the point, which is dry and normally chopped and served on sandwiches because it isn't pretty and it certainly isn't fatty.  The link looked hopeful though.  I totally dug the hot carrots!!!  

So, Texas BBQ is supposed to not require any sauce at all.  But this stuff had to be doused in it!  I had to bathe my meat in it for goodness sakes.  There was absolutely no flavor to any of the meat and no seasoning (and by that I mean salt and pepper) in sight.  

Never will I ever go back to Rudy's.  And I am NOT just writing this subpar review because of LMB...I honestly and truthfully was grossed out and extremely let down by the appearance, taste, and lackluster flair of their food. Sure Little Miss BBQ is a bit more of a drive, but their meat is juicy, flavorful, and doesn't require any sauce whatsoever.  Their sides are tasty too."}
{"text":"What a lucky find! Brisket, ribs, pulled pork - all sold by the half pound. Decided to try it because the reviews looked good and it was convenient to our hotel. The line out the door and down the sidewalk was the first clue we discovered a great place. So happy when we got inside only to discover the line then snaked through the room like a Disneyland ride. Tell them what you want and they give it all to you in a big tub and you go find yourself a seat. Crazy place and oh, SO good! Can't go wrong with the moist brisket, pulled pork, ribs or creamed corn!"}
{"text":"Same great food, new location.  I like the leaner brisket, but have tried everything at different locations and EVERYTHING is good.  Forget the sissy sause and just go with the good stuff, BUT this stuff is so good try it without first.  There are no plates, so just get over it the food wont be there long anyway......."}
{"text":"Unimpressed.

The place is very large, I'll give it that. Definitely has a big Texas BBQ barn feel to it. Service was quick and efficient and all meat was delivered before leaving the counter which was also good. But my problem is with the food itself. What was supposed to be moist brisket was closer to lean. I liberally splashed their sauce on my brisket and had a bite. Chew chew chew, try to swallow, too dry, gag it up back into my mouth and mulch in more saliva before it would finally go down. More splashing of sauce. Still more splashing - maybe 10oz sauce total before the so-called \"moist brisket\" slid down easily. Meat tasted of smoke but just about nothing else apart from the sauce I put on. Jalapeno sausage was okay, I should have just had a meal of that. The corn was good - juicy and cooked perfectly. Sauce taste was ok (Famous Dave's Devil Spit is far better though, and just about ALL of the sources at Pork On A Fork blow it away). Wife didn't like the beans. I'd give the coleslaw about 6/10.

Bottom line, the experience was pretty good in terms of layout, service, seating and amenities - up to and including the handwash trough which I thought was awesome. But the food was the let-down. Probably won't go back - honestly, I'd even prefer Dillons."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness...you want real BBQ?! This is your place. Any time the BBQ conversation starts, I ask if they've been to Rudy's because they are worth every bite. Half lean, half moist and some beans on the side baby and I'm ready to chow down."}
{"text":"Love this place where you get delicious food for a great price.  Been here tons of times and I have need had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Awesome spot, great meat. Love the country feel with the folding chairs and paper as plates. Spicy chop was definitely my favorite meat. A little spicy and sweet. The pudding dessert was great too. The baked potato was huge! We were able to share it as a family side with our meats. Yummmm! We tried their breakfast tacos a couple days ago and those were a hit too. Can't wait to buy those again."}
{"text":"Found Rudy's driving by, smelled soooo good from the parking lot! We've now come here on purpose, making a 40 minute drive to have the best BBQ around! It is served by weight, 1/2 lb is normal, for brisket, turkey, ribs and seating is very informal at picnic tables inside! The food is very good, prices seemed reasonable. Kid/family friendly. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed :+D"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Rudy's in Texas, much better in Texas, my wife had the prime rib, not a lot of flavor, & very dry. I had the half pork ribs, also very dry and little flavor, added the BBG sauce, made it better, but it should have been good with out sauce, Great with it. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I have no idea how anyone rates this place lower than a 5. Best self service authentic BBQ place I have probably ever been to. Smoke ring on the brisket, excellent in house bbq sauce, cool hand washing station.... This place is cool. Only thing I would change is make the store and the service bar smaller and add a full bar and stage!!!"}
{"text":"Great Texas style Beef Brisket.  I ordered the moist brisket and it did not disappoint.  Baby Back Ribs were not that great, but I live in Missouri and have the benefit of Kansas City and St. Louis BBQ to judge by.  The ribs were bland in flavor and didn't have a lot of taste.  Sausage was great as well.  Overall great BBQ and great atmosphere.  It was busy inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. I highly recommend this place for good BBQ. Everything on menu is decent price and large portions."}
{"text":"I had been to Rudy's on NM. It was not great, but OK. I decided to give the Chandler store a try. I had the moist brisket, and a jalapeno link. The brisket was mostly burnt to a crisp, and almost half was fat. I could not even chew through the link, and it was very greasy. The beans were plain. The white bread was stale. 

This is a HIGH priced self service BBQ joint. Everything is by the pound at the counter. No wait staff. Plastic silverware, and butcher paper is all they have. I would call this low class. Yes it may be what some call traditional, but I like to have real plates and silverware.

Back to the old standby Honeybears or Dave's"}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ. Brisket very moist & delicious. Ribs so tender they fall off the bone. Sides are amazing-baked beans, coleslaw & potato salad. Desserts are yummy too, especially the banana pudding. Tried the Smoked Baked Potato w/Brisket-more please. Will definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"Try the moist brisket it's the BOMB. The burnt ends are full of smokiness, tender perfection. I have spent many years in Texas and the South East and this has been my favorite brisket. Rudy's is known all over for there creamed corn( Tasty). The pinto beans have that smoky goodness flavor too. Personally not a fan of the potato salad. It was pretty bland to me. Peach cobbler and banana pudding are always good for the dessert. Don't order the baby back ribs. They are tough with little meat and flavor. Instead ask for the pork ribs. The lines are long, but they move fast. Remember long lines means good food. Management is good too. If there is a problem just let them know and they will make it right. At least it's been that way for me..."}
{"text":"I found Rudy's when I was working in Albuquerque.  One job assignment took me by the location every day for a week and I ate at Rudy's every day for lunch.   I am hooked on the extra lean brisket, corn on the cob (swimming in butter...yum!) and the banana pudding.   I love that the meat isn't already covered in sauce because the meat really doesn't need it, but also, I like a very specific amount and others rarely get it right.   I order the brisket extra lean because I hate paying for \"fat.\" They get it right every time.  The banana pudding has Vanilla Wafers as a faux crust and I love the blend of pudding and cookie.   It completely reminds me of what my grandmother would make if she ever made something like this.

I shared other reviewer's frustrations about the sauce and the bottles, but I've gone to Rudy's so many times now that I know how to tip/shake the bottle to dispense the correct amount of sauce.  It's really not that annoying, but I can see how first time visitors would think, \"Am I doing this right?\"

While you run the risk of sitting next to people you don't know, there is plenty of seating indoors and in the covered patio.

My only suggestion on ways to make this location better would be to make the order placing area bigger.  During busy times, it's difficult to navigate through the crowds at closer registers to registers down the line.  Larger families prohibit access to the salad and dessert refrigerator until the next cashier is literally shouting, \"NEXT IN LINE.\"   I've had a cashier repeatedly shout at me to come to the register as I was frantically trying to get my side dishes and banana pudding from the 'fridge.    It temporarily ticked me off, but the friendliness she showed once I got to the register negated the impact of the shouting.

All in all, I happily make the 30 minute trek to Rudy's just to sit, talk and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place. It isn't the best bbq and sides ever but it is good and easy.  Buying brisket or prime rib by the pound, yum!

Also, the chopped beef breakfast burrito is likely the best breakfast burrito I have ever had.  Even though it is pre-made in a warmer with flour tortilla, cheese, egg and lots of seasoned brisket.  So so so good.  Having brisket for breakfast?  Yes please!!"}
{"text":"Realy good bbq service is great love this place
We had the moist brisket the green chili stew half chicken the best potato salad I have had realy good cream corn and coleslaw"}
{"text":"I am not sure what I really think of this place, its like a cafeteria. You get a tray and you pick the meat you want and they weigh it in front of you like if you're at a deli and everything is a la carte, they have no combos. Meat was pretty good, not the worst, however not the best. The prime rib we got had a huge chunk of fat which we are paying for because it adds to the weight of the meat so I don't like that. Its a chill spot, but not my fav, prob wont be back. Service is good, good customer service."}
{"text":"Rudy's is simple but good, really good. The sides are just as tasty as the smoked meats. The creamed corn is pretty much one of the best things around. You can pickup beer in buckets when ordering, which is a fun Texas style twist. I usually go with a Shiner which is pretty much a no brainer with bbq. Everyone eats on huge picnic tables with wax paper. They have a garaged off patio that would be great during the spring. The atmosphere makes you feel like you are on vacation out in the country. It's a great place."}
{"text":"Was in town rite next door to this place so bbq sounded awesome . It's kinda difrent getting your food it's allacart but unique was nice inside . The staff was very nice the food portions were very large . This is a good bbq place and very fast service like fast food but real food so if in a hurry u can be in and out very quick ."}
{"text":"The food is great! The brisket is the best in Chandler. The service and parking are my issue. There is no take out parking, causing me to park next door Denny's. The order I called in advance, was wrong. I ordered 2 sandwiches, and 2 orders of brisket, with 4 sides of potato salad. I only received 1 potato salad. I should have known something was wrong, when the take out employee said she put the potato salad at the bottom of the bag. Who puts cold potato salad under hot meat? The corn on the cob was bland. 
Rudy's meat is great, just check your take out order before leaving."}
{"text":"Rudy's is absolutely THE BEST!  In my area they are across the street from Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ and ALL of the biz is at Rudy's!  Delicious BBQ and sides!  Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is definitely right up there with the top BBQ places in the valley. I ordered the pork loin, which generally isn't the kind of thing I'd judge a barbecue place for, but this was absolutely delicious. The cream corn and banana pudding was pretty good as well.

I'm really looking forward to making it out to that side of town again, to try the brisket and the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! It made this semi \"vegetarian \" dive in for a bite of the most delicious brisket EVER! 
Potato salad amazing! Cole slaw was good too. Every bite worth the calories! They have a loaded baked potato on the menu was Delicious."}
{"text":"The brisket is amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious tender juicy bbq at reasonable prices. Service is good. When I had a problem, the manager really took care of my family. The brisket is the smokiest I have ever eaten with a smoke ring that is incredible (if you are in to that). Don;t miss the brisket and pork ribs. They have sweet tea too! Happy camper here."}
{"text":"All around a great experience. The workers were friendly, very informative, and the food was outstanding. I recommend the pulled pork and a loaded potatoe."}
{"text":"Bring the family for some good country BBQ and great food.  The creamed corn is to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing...everything is good, especially the green chile stew. Gonna be back every time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Authentic Texas BBQ.  Brisket, pulled pork, turkey and the beans is what we order every time we come. We alway hit up Rudys when ever we are in this part of Chandler. Breakfast tacos are amazing if you come in the morning."}
{"text":"This was...meh...ok.  Not good enough food for me to consider going back.  By the time we got our food to the table and sat down to eat, the meat was lukewarm and then quickly was just flat out cold.  We got the baby back ribs, pulled pork, and brisket.  Normally, I don't like brisket but this brisket was tender.  The only problem was that it wasn't hot.

Also had some corn on the cob but it must have been swimming in a tub of water for too long because when you bit into it, the corn kernels were very mushy.  Bleh.

Did NOT care for either of their BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"After eating BBQ in Phx for 20 + years, I can say that Rudy's has by far the BEST BBQ in Phx that I have tried. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is bc of the price; as with ALL BBQ restaurants, BBQ meat is not inexpensive but worth it, especially at Rudys. Compared to other local places or even high end \"boutique\" BBQ places, their prices are still very competitive and the product speaks for itself. The Moist Brisket is personal favorite, as for it \"with black\" and they will custom slice from the dark, rich, burned sides of the smoked brisket. I think one of the best points about Rudys...like other places, they don't nickel and dime you for sauces and condiments. VERY generous !"}
{"text":"Texas style bbq served in a family type dining. Delicious briskett, ribs, turkey, pulled pork and lots of other fixings. And the prices are great too. So Worth it!"}
{"text":"My brother had seen this place and suggested we try it out.  All three of us were pleased with the sandwiches we ordered.  As first time guests, we were greeted by Miguel who is the manager and he offered us samples of their meats - brisket, pulled pork, smoked turkey and
pork loin... That was a pleasant note as we then knew just what we wanted when we were ready to order.   There is quite a large selection of beers by the can or bottle and also some interesting sodas you don't see often...All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful, especially Miguel.   We were surprised when he stopped by our table as we ate to return our change from when we paid for our orders at the front counter.  We explained we'd intended that as a tip but Miguel politely thanked us and said they don't accept tips.  That's very unusual these days."}
{"text":"I first visited Rudy's when I was in Austin, Texas and I love this place. This location, just south of Phoenix, is pretty much identical to their Texas locations, except no gas station, LOL.

You can buy all your favorite meats here, by weight, and the service is great. 

Get there before 10 AM and they have breakfast tacos ready to grab and go at the counter. The brisket ones are my favorite. 

For a more standard meal, order you meat, grab your side dishes, and head over to their condiment bar after you pay and grab as much bread, sauce and pickles to your stomach's delight.

They've also opened another location just of 10-West near Litchfield.

Great place to grab a quick, yummy meal before or after hitting up a Cactus League baseball game."}
{"text":"What's not to like? You order your meat by weight and it's all delicious. Chicken, brisket, ribs, they have it all. 

The sides aren't bad, either. I am also a big fan of their cups of puddings you can pull from the fridge while in line.

If you're there earlier, the breakfast tacos are a must.

This location is perfect if you are leaving the area via 10 coming out of a spring training game in Goodyear...."}
{"text":"Good food, chicken was moist fall of the bone delicious pork ribs yummy potato salad amazing."}
{"text":"While staying at a hotel across the street, I visited this place mainly out of proximity.  Turns out they cook up really, really good BBQ.  The meat was cooked just perfectly, the sausage delicious, and they give you plenty of sauce to take with you when you order take out.  

A very easy, quick experience with take out and everyone here was super friendly."}
{"text":"Much better than Famous Dave's. The long line tells the tale."}
{"text":"I just spent $43 on the FATTIEST brisket EVER!!! Just a whole lot of smoked fat with a tiny bit of brisket. On sliver was ALL fat!! I also bought beans, coleslaw, cream corn and potato salad. The only edible sides were the corn and beans with the beans as the best. This was my second attempt (first wasn't great which is why it's been over a year, but it was better than this visit), but I can promise that I'll NEVER go back. The one star is for the beans...."}
{"text":"So I stopped in for a quick bite. Looked at the menu and noticed the Smoked Potato. I had to try it. I ordered it with meat because I was hungry and even double checked with the server if it was a filling meal, she assured me it was more than adequate.
Well let me tell you it wasn't. There was hardly any cheese or sour cream and barely any meat. Definitely not worth the money. I ended up cooking more food here at the house after I finished my appetizer from Rudys. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food outstanding, service and food always good, love it!   BBQ is wonderful brisket to tender!"}
{"text":"I eat here every time I come to Phoenix on business!  I originally ate at Rudy's in Austin when I have business there and I'm hooked.  If only they could come to Southern California!

Everything is fresh and perfectly cooked.  Sides are awesome and it is a fun atmosphere.  There are plenty of TV's to watch sports too."}
{"text":"I'd go back to this place. We stopped in on a whim to find a place to eat while driving down Chandler Blvd. We turned the corner onto the side street and had choice of 2 BBQ places there as another place just next door. So happened we turned left and not right into rudys. Never being there caught us off guard as we didn't know the proceedure on the operation of the joint. Watching we caught on winding up to the counter to order we passed many bottle drinks in ice and a refer with sides. In line we made it to the order desk and got our beef or pork order. It doesn't say much about what one orders but it is by the 1/2 lb. or the sandwich. The food was good and  after the cleanup easy as they have a novel wash up sink for those with hands sticky with BBQ sauce. 
The 2 of us spend $20 with no drinks. We drink water when out as so much profit is in soda drink which are bad for one anyway. I don't like drinking candybars."}
{"text":"Went to the ribbon cutting with The Chandler Chamber then promptly came back with the family the next night. Can you say the best creamed  corn in the world? Awsone brisket and great staff"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get BBQ.  All of the sides are delicious. (I am yet to try the green chili soup) spicy chop sandwich is wonderful.  I will gladly drive the 47 miles from Anthem to get it.  Don't forget to grab some banana pudding.  They have a wide variety of beers to wet your whistle.  No french fries so I hope you like potatoe salad.


Just tried their breakfast tacos... basically a burrito they just fold them nstead of role them up.  I have eaten them two days in a row and and have tried all of the pre made tacos.. jalape√±o sausage was the best so was the spicy chop.  All in all they are great.  The premade all have a Meat, eggs and cheese for 1.95 each.  One is enough two will fill you good luck with three."}
{"text":"Had the turkey sandwich, and the jalape√±o sausage egg breakfast burrito. Both were average."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on the 31st of January. 

We were greeted right when we walked in the door and were given the run down since this was our first visit. Very neat little concept. 

They gave us a sample of the brisket and it was very moist and cooked to perfection. 

My hubby had:
Chopped Beef Sandwich
3 bean Salad
New Potatoes 
Green Chili Stew

He raved about all of it. 

I had the 
Pulled Pork Sandwich
New Potatoes 
Green Chili Stew. 

The sandwich was good...new potatoes are red potatoes in butter. 

The green chili stew I did not care for. Little on the spicy side for my taste and never in my life have I had diced tomatoes in a green chili stew. 

All of the above with two medium drinks came out to around $28.00

My only two complaints I would have for this place is.....

Tell your staff to keep their hands out of their pants. We were walking up to the drink dispenser and the young man was changing out the ice tea bins and his hand was almost elbow deep in the back of his pants.....I have no idea but I chose not to get ice tea.

In the female bathrooms you should have toilet seat liners. That is just disgusting that you do not."}
{"text":"I really do like this place.
The jalape√±o sausage, the turkey. the BBQ sauce. Everything.
What I like most, is you can see your food coming out of the smoker before they cut it. It's not wrapped in plastic wrap and on a buffet line. 
SO flavorful too. Hands down great BBQ, CARBS ARE THE ENEMY!"}
{"text":"This place is everything that everyone says. All the staff were pleasant and helpful. The gal that helped me had been there since 5 a.m. . This was approximately 11 in the morning. She was so nice & helpful. The food is amazing. Unlike many places, their corn on the cob was absolutely perfect. The ribs were juicy and tender and peach cobbler was unbelievable. I would also like to add that my order was to go it wasn't eaten there and it was still amazing when I got back to my hotel room. I recommended this place too many of my friends who pass by and since it is so close to the freeway they will be able too."}
{"text":"Rudys is an amazing BBQ experience. Love their moist beef brisket. Their cream corn is to die for. I have been to the ones in Texas and this one didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast. All sorts of breakfast tacos, such a great concept.
They need to open one in Denver suburbs!!!
Can also buy pounds of sliced meats to take home."}
{"text":"So my wife and I are staying a block and 1/2 from Rudy's. I can see from our hotel room. We order takeout. We got 1/2 lb of ribs, 1 lb of brisket, 1/2 lb of turkey, a potato, potato salad and bread. We picked it up and back to the room. We had bread with no butter, had a potato with no butter and no potato salad. Very disappointing. But we still had meat. Ribs were without flavor even with all their different sauces. Turkey was dry with no flavor and even the brisket was the best out of the three, that's not saying much for Rudy's.  We were very sad that the food and service was this bad. There is nothing we like about it and yes we read the reviews and went any way. Don't do what we did just pick another place to go. We weren't inside long, but glad we didn't stay music was to loud."}
{"text":"Its rare for us to go out for bbq, but we will get the craving once in a blue moon. Last Sunday that craving came and I suggested we try out Rudy's since it was new and buzzin' and just down the street from us. 

I ordered a 1/2 lb of the moist brisket and the BF had the jalapeno sausage sandwich. We also got small creamed corn, cole slaw & green chile stew. All that with one beer and a small drink and we paid around $20, not bad. Bread slices are complimentary.

Brisket was super moist and tender! I tried it with the two different sauce and actually preferred the meat alone with no sauce. It was melt in your mouth awesome. Jalapeno sausage was okay, not spicy at all though. Creamed corn was good, not Lawry's good, but I'd order it again. I actually sprinkled a little salt and it tasted better. That's just me, I like the sweet & salty combo. Green chile stew was good also. Not spicy but flavorful. Cole slaw was exactly like KFC's, but that's okay with me 'cause I like KFCs slaw. Bread was the generic supermarket white & wheat bread. I had a bite or two. 

Only a week has passed and I'm already craving for some brisket again. This is saying something about the place cause like I've mentioned, BBQ cravings come around once or twice a year for me."}
{"text":"I love the food here!  Best BBQ in the Valley.

The turkey is awesome, and the brisket, pulled pork and chopped BBQ are just great.  Don't forget the cream corn it is like desert.  Oh, I forgot the breakfast tacos, yum.  Okay, I like everything here!  Just writing this makes me hungry.

My highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ. The brisket, turkey, and most of the meats are great. I haven't tried the sausage so don't know about that. The best thing here has to be the morning breakfast tacos, these can be customized the way you like them or just pick up the to go ones which are good too. Personally, I like mine with brisket, potatoes, and cheese. All the sides sort of suck though, the best sides are chips. Wish they had fries or baked BBQ beans.  This would make this place exceptional if they had better sides."}
{"text":"This has become a new favorite stopping place while traveling through AZ. My husband is a big fan of pulled pork and says this is the best he has ever eaten. We loved the creamed corn, the potato salad and the puddings. Customer service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Sadly, we give it a 3. We finally went, with high hopes, but were sorely disappointed. I had a hankerin for some pulled pork. Thank goodness they give samples for first timers.  I couldn't get past a second bite. Just not the traditional type. Now, maybe that's part of the draw for most folks, but we sure didn't like the tangy sauce at all. Place was packed though, so clearly we're an exception. Maybe because we're used to the real stuff in Texas and Oklahoma. We have no idea how this place was popular in Texas. But, the place is just adorable and the staff is just wonderful. Liked the long picnic table style seating and it's nice that they have a separate area with smaller families. Great for large groups as long as they like the food. The turkey was pretty good as long as I didn't use any sauce. Probably won't be back. FYI, the bbq place next door is the Applebee's of bbq and a one star place... Unless you love Applebee's... :-)"}
{"text":"I'm a smoker and this place is on point, by the pound off butcher paper and clean up after yourself my kind of place"}
{"text":"Originally I wanted to go to Speakeasy. I thought it would be a throwback to the 20's. Not even close to that BTW.

On to Rudy's which is pretty much next door, and we made a fantastic choice.  I had the Moist Brisket and my Partner had the Turkey Sandwhich. They both were awesome. Paired with the Rudy Beans and a Peach Cobbler that was great. I wish they had Ice Cream for the Cobbler.  While we were there a family of five sat next to us and had a BBQ picnic style meal. The setting is cool with the table layouts. If you enjoy beer (never been one to tip it back) you will enjoy the large beer troff they have. I am a firm believer that the BBQ sauce makes or breaks a place and this was nothing short of Fantastic. They have a spicy and a \"Sissy\" flavor, both very enjoyable. We were offered samples and I had a very difficult time choosing since they were all very good tasting."}
{"text":"Not to bad. Meat was favorable with a hint of smoke. BB we're moist with a good rub. If you like BBQ it worth a try. Every one have different tastes but for me I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food.  Bit pricey but not overpriced value for what you get.  Don't forget the paper to put down hahahaha."}
{"text":"My favorite place everytime me and my boyfriend come in town. The meat is delicious and tender. Wish they can open one up in Los Angeles it would definitely be a hit. My favorite is the beef brisket baked beans and sweet corn"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! We walked in and were immediately welcomed with smiling faces. Then we explained we had never been there before. And the guys face lit up and was excited to explain how their restaurant worked. The atmosphere was very family friendly and the staff continued to be super awesome and helpful.  These people actually seemed to love their jobs! And on Mondays they do military discount! Totally recommend this place the food will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"First thing people will probably want to know is how long the wait is.  At 11:30, the wait was about 15 minutes, and my gf was already in line at the doorjam of the entrance.  If you get there at 12:30 (when we left), I noticed the line was inside near the breakfast tacos area.  

Next off, I don't have any nostalgia from eating at Rudy's from when I was young (I'm from Chicago).  I also recently ate at the Texas BBQ house up in Scottsdale which makes me feel like I'm a bit of a Texas BBQ expert.  Imagine if you watched a bunch of travel documentaries about London.  Two weeks later, you travel to London and get off the plane.  That's how I feel when I walked into Rudy's.

We ordered brisket (moist), turkey, cream of corn, and new potatoes.  The brisket was awesome.  Very moist compared to other BBQ I've had.    The turkey was also not dry at all, and it was well flavored.  Cream of corn was excellent and not too sweet.  The new potatoes were quartered boiled potatoes with butter drenched on them (yes delicious).  You get some bread with your meal and everything comes on wax paper which is supposed to be shiny side up.  I like their condiments area with the different peppers.  Their sweet tea was also great, and I especially liked how it wasn't as cloyingly sweet as I've had at other places.

The only downfall is that I wish their sauces tasted better.  They have their bbq and their sissy.  It's probably a personal preference, but I like a sauce with some major kick to it.  I mixed in the hot sauce into the Rudy's sauce which made it taste better.  I also think the brisket needed some sauce to it.  Even though it was moist, it lacked on salt.

Those reasons aside, I found the food to be the best Texas BBQ I've had.  Long lines may be there, but it moves pretty quickly and gives you time to figure out what you want.  I'll definitely be back here when I have another BBQ kick."}
{"text":"We love Rudy's. I just ordered a meal for 20 people last weekend and it was a huge amount of food. Well forth the pick up and no need to cook it myself. It was all good ribs, brisket, sausage and of course all the sides. And to top it off you get all the paper products, drinks, ice and tablecloth. Truly amazing!"}
{"text":"Came out to Goodyear to visit a buddy for the weekend and heard rave reviews about the bbq here. Decided to stop by for lunch on the way out of town and so glad I did! The girl working the registering found out it was our first time and gave us a few samples of menu items to help in our decision. Once I tried the chopped brisket I was sold! Also got a pulled pork sandwich and a few sides and they where all excellent! Next time I'm in Goodyear this is my first stop!"}
{"text":"Overpriced -very bland not so tender meat had pork ribs. Baby back ribs and brisket. Hated the choice of BBQ sauces -greasy meat won't be back."}
{"text":"I was really happy to see Rudy's expand to Phoenix.  I discovered Rudy's at their original location in a converted gas station in San Antonio.  The Chandler location does a great job of upholding the Texas tradition.  My favorites are the moist brisket and regular sausage.  Both very tasty.  Rudy's is a pretty large place but because the food is so good the lines get pretty long during lunch or dinner so come early.  They cut up the meat at the counter to your order and wrap it to go or serve it on butcher paper.  Certainly one of the best BBQ stops in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to go with the family. Picnic style seating with tvs.
The BBQ is really good it's just hard to judge how much to get because you by everything by weight. My wife gets the BBQ potato its huge and reasonably priced. 
My favorite is the pork loin and jalape√±o sausage. 
Really good ice tea and all the free pickles you can eat...."}
{"text":"I must admit. Disappointed. I had been anticipating going after driving by almost daily seeing the parking lot always packed. The lines didn't bother me. The wait didn't bother me. The atmosphere was pretty cool. 

But the food? Plain. I can easily say we probably ordered every thing on the menu between our group and nothing stood out. I should be able to eat without drowning it in sauce. And then unfortunately their signature sauce wasn't all that great either...

And seriously? Just a plain old loaf of bread? 

I ate it. Will I go back? Most likely not. Especially if I'm the one paying."}
{"text":"The absolute best bbq I've had. Their meats are so good. Their sides are delicious. Very friendly people. Just wish they had more locations so we don't have to drive half an hour one way"}
{"text":"Stopped on a Sunday 1:30. Packed but moving people throughout fast. Seemed extra Good today.... maybe hungry for barbq too. Babe ribs smoked perfect. Didn't need sauce but \"icing on the cake\" appetizer. I got Spicey and sauce sandwich. SooooGoood   Wife got brisket sandwich, must been end -lots of crispy smoked meat. Said Best she ever had at Rudies. We come often But today everything exceptional."}
{"text":"THE BEST BRISKET MOIST & CREAM CORN IN TOWN!! Hands down. I always comes back for more. The brisket just so delicate and they cut in the perfect size to munch down and the cream corn is just so delicious. They always have a long line during lunch on weekdays and always full during the weekend. I had try so many BBQ places in AZ but this is by far my favorite. YUMMY YUM YUM!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are big fans of BBQ, and yesterday we ventured into Rudy's for lunch.  Overall it was pretty darn good, but it had its \"meh\" moments, too.

The line was long, but moved quickly - a great sign of good things to come.  I had the brisket sandwich (moist), potato salad and banana pudding while hubby opted for a pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw.  The brisket was out of this world, and my husband was very envious as his pork was \"just okay\".  Neither of us were fond of the potato salad or coleslaw, so that was a bit of a bummer.  I really wish they had baked beans or mac and cheese, but next time I'll try the new potatoes.  The banana pudding though, was divine.  It could rival my grandmother's homemade banana pudding, but we won't tell her that.  I have been thinking about it all day and am even considering stopping on my way home to grab some.  Haha!

Yes it's picnic tables, and no it's not very fancy.  But c'mon folks, it's BBQ, not Ruth's Chris.  

It's close to our home, reasonably priced, and tasty so we will definitely be back.  Next time though, hubby will be ordering the brisket."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to admit that this was my first visit to Rudy's. This location is in my backyard (not literally). In fact, I watched them building the place. Probably two years ago at least. Finally, I can say I've sampled their offerings.

BBQ is one of my favorite styles of cooking, but I don't enjoy it often enough. That might be because the places I've been to are hit or miss. Rudy's is definitely a hit!

The first impression is made in the parking lot. It smells so good! Then you step inside and the second impression will probably be a lot of people waiting in line to place their orders. Be patient. There is a reason why the line is long. And it moves quickly.

While you are waiting, there will be plenty of time to make your selection. And don't forget to watch the folks on the carving station as they work. It's fascinating! You also might be lucky enough to be the recipient of meat that was just pulled from their holding cabinet/pit.

I chose the (moist) Brisket. I love that the BBQ is priced per half pound, so you can choose how much you want depending on your appetite. Based on how delicious my Brisket was, I cannot wait to try the other proteins! And I just found my new favorite BBQ sauce. Rudy's \"Sause\" is freaking fabulous!

Factoring in the variety and quality of the sides, plus the original stew, add the dining room atmosphere and the overall value, and Rudy's is a winner! See y'all again real soon!"}
{"text":"What can I say beyond that this place is awesome. I've had pretty much everything on the menu and the staff is always super accomodating. If you ever get a chance and are in the area early enough, try the breakfast tacos!"}
{"text":"Love the meat, sandwiches and potato salad here. The sissy sauce is my favorite! 

I usually get the smoked turkey sandwich but their ribs and sausage are great too!"}
{"text":"Best brisket tri tip in town. Love the setup, love the bread and sauce..my favorite!"}
{"text":"Metal chairs, butcher paper for plates, food by the pound which allows them to provide (charge) more than you ask for, signs which say \"your mother doesn't work here, pick up after yourself\", weak side dishes.  Yep, this isn't real Texas bbq."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this one. I had tried Rudy's in NYC during the BBQ fest a few different times and remembered liking it, so I was stoked to learn they had a location outside of Austin. Some aspects of this place are fabulous, but some make me want to run away and never return. BF and I ordered food to take home from here after a trip to IKEA (we both needed a reward for surviving that place on a Sunday!). We ordered: 1 potato w/Moist Brisket, 1 side of stew, 1 pulled pork bbq sandwich, a side of beans, and one fountain drink. 

The way you order food is the same for here and to-go, kind of like Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert (which, I'll just tell you right now, is FAR AND AWAY 100x better than this place overall). They even have the troughs of sodas and beers to choose from-I'm fairly certain the bottled Coke is of the Mexican variety, though as you'll learn in a moment, I did not opt for the bottled soda. If you're debating between bottle and fountain soda, GET THE BOTTLE!!!!!!!! I can. not. stress. this. enough.

Why, you may ask, is it so vitally important that one not order a fountain soda? Well, my friends, Rudy's sadly does not filter their water. The ice cubes were revolting, which was my first clue-as I popped one in my mouth I was immediately repulsed, but for some reason I decided to chance it with the soda (which, duh, is made with the same non-filtered water + syrup). BAD IDEA. Grossest soda everrr. And I love fountain sodas! From places that actually filter their water, that is. I wish Phoenix water was better, maybe I'm just spoiled from my time in NYC where I could drink tap water with no weird taste, but BF agreed that the water was definitely funky. Sadly, this problem affects other aspects of the food, causing anything that was steamed by the water to have a weird taste (at least I'm guessing that's why). What's interesting is their sweet tea (which is unbelievably sweet, and is much more palatable when mixed with the unsweetened, conveniently located directly next to it) is delish. I'm chalking that up to the water being boiled first in order to make the tea. 

On to the food...my \"moist brisket\" was moist, as promised, but was comprised mostly of fat. I know I've had brisket that is both moist and not fatty before so maybe it was just a one-off. The potato didn't taste like a baked potato, probably because it's roasted and not baked, but it wasn't at all crispy skinned like I was hoping. I'll take the blame for that one. The pulled pork was moist and juicy and the sandwich bread was perfect for it. The beans, not so great-too runny and had a flavor I wasn't a fan of (can't put my finger on it, which I realize is not that helpful). 

The stew was the highlight by far-it's a pork stew with what I believe was green chilis and potatoes, and had a really unique and tasty flavor that had both me and the BF craving more. I recommend pairing it with corn chips! 

The prices were definitely great-we got out of there for under $20 for a ton of stuff! We also snagged some of the to-go sauces so we can experiment with the tangy bbq on other foods at home. The staff were friendly and definitely do a LOT of work-when you place your order at the counter, the cashier is the one who puts all of your food together, including assembling sandwiches! I would come back to try some of the other menu items, but if it's brisket I'm craving I'm heading to Joe's next time."}
{"text":"I've been around the country a time or two. My grandfather was from Oklahoma so I've been exposed to bbq and brisket from a young age. But this place called Rudy's is on a whole different planet of good eats. I HAVE NEVER HAD BRISKET THIS TENDER!!!!! ever. Smoked turkey, jalape√±o sausage, potato salad, cole slaw, ribs, EVERYTHING was delicious. 

I was in town for a meeting down the street and my coworker suggested this place. Another coworkers eyes and spirit lifted when he heard that there was a Rudy's in Goodyear, he's from Austin. 

Everything is excellent. Great smoked meats. Great for sharing. Great for kids. Great for everything. Can't wait to create an excuse to travel 500 miles for this meal."}
{"text":"Holy cow is this some yummy BBQ. Hubby went on opening day and stood around in the AZ sun, just to get some grub. He's been talking abt it ever since. We went today as a family and he was NOT kidding! 

The ribs, the pulled pork, the pudding...HEAVENLY. There are no plates and everything is served on a plastic tray with butcher wax paper. So don't come here expecting to not get messy. Bring your wet naps, grab some napkins or wash up at their wash station...if you don't like messy, don't come here. They also have a mini bar with condiments, a large assortment drinks (including beer) and plenty of seating indoor and out.
 
We've found our new BBQ place! Can't wait to try the rest of the things on the menu! Yummy yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"We had a really good experience here. The food was very good. I loved the barbecue sauce so much that we took a bottle of it home. We told the person at the counter that this was or first time and she gave us some samples to try so we could decide what we wanted. We ordered the chopped barbecue and a whole sausage, corn, potato salad and beans. My husband and I shared.  Everything was delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the atmosphere, it's cafeteria style seating. I prefer a sit down restaurant, but no big deal. We met friends here and everyone enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"Their breakfast tacos are where it's at! 

My boyfriend introduced me to Rudy's and the smell lured me in from the start. One to two tacos and you're set. I had one with cheese, egg, potato, brisket and put some of their bbq sauce on it. AMAZING!!! 

If you have a smoker at home, consider picking up some of their BBQ sauce, Beef, and Turkey rub!"}
{"text":"I could be persuaded to go back and update this review later. I came with my family, and without someone explaining to us how it worked, we would've been somewhat lost on how to order. Thankfully, the cashier was nice and offered us samples. I usually go for brisket at a BBQ place, but I thought Rudy's was a bit dry and lacking flavor. I'm not sure which one we tried; you can order the brisket three different ways depending on how lean you want your cut. The pulled pork and the turkey were really good, juicy and full of flavor. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich. Meat came on a standard hamburger bun; it would be nice if it was toasted, but it didn't look like mine was.

With all the sides being a la carte, meals add up quickly. I didn't try any sides, but my family members did. You have to grab your silverware, drinks, and condiments. I thought the Rudy's \"sause\" (not sure why they spell it as such) was good, but they had a wimpy version with less heat, which I didn't find necessary, because the regular didn't seem spicy. I thought my sandwich was decent, but none of my family members raved about their food. You also have to clean up after yourself, which is fine, but I guess I wasn't expecting that. It's more of a fast food place, I suppose. It was good for a quick dinner, and we were hungry. If we had time, we would've gone to Bobby Q, because that place is excellent."}
{"text":"Rudys is a great West Valley addition. It's nice to see an establishment like this open up. It's still a little drive for me, but it's worth it. 

I like Rudys because its different, It's not your usual BBQ restaurants. You walk in and immediately you have a host or hostess to help you. If it's your first time there it can be confusing. Their breakfast tacos are already in the heater ready to go. You have self serve choice to make before you can get to the counter and place your order. Now they sell their meat by the pound, I had their pork ribs, potato salad, and had to try their brisket breakfast taco. Surprisingly the taco was very good, wasn't sure if it was going to be since it had a combination of eggs, cheese, and brisket. But then again whats in a machaca burrito? And they taste great! The ribs were a dry rub, and you add the BBQ sauce at your table. Without the sauce it was pretty decent, and the added sauce made it that much better. Ribs had a lot of meat so they are not cheating you on anything. 

I had a great time here, friendly service, received my food very quickly, and the food was good. The atmosphere was really cool also! 
This is definitely a place I would like to visit occasionally."}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning to see what breakfast was like. Greeted and told about the breakfast tacos. Friendly staff, told them it was my first time there and they offered samples. The samples tasted fine, so I decided to purchase some breakfast tacos and take them home where my son and I could share them. Got some bbq sauce also. Cut each one in half in order to sample all three. Nothing special......until later in the day. Shortly after noon both I and my son experienced stomach and intestinal problems that persisted until late afternoon. Only thing it could have been is those dang breakfast tacos. My son said they tasted strange and he must have been right, maybe under cooked pork or somehow tainted, but no matter, there was something wrong. Not often do I give a place a second chance once they have made me sick, so I will pass on further trips to Rudys. To bad, I was looking for a good bbq place."}
{"text":"Second time being here and had to bring a friend.

Got their breakfast tacos and let me tell you, GREAT! A little messy but what great tasting taco isn't...

The floor set up reminds me of family reunions. Long tables lined up and everyone sits next to each other.

Also noticed they serve First Responders with respect and generosity. Well done Rudy's!"}
{"text":"Great place! Great food! Great Service! We stop everytime we are out in Chandler! We need one in Surprise!!!!"}
{"text":"Really just subpar. The west valley is starving for good food, and sadly this does not really add much. The meat is dry and pretty bland. The BBQ sauce is not great, I've had better from the grocery store. Definitely not worth the hype. I would rather drive to Bobby-Q or Porkopolis, the drive is worth it."}
{"text":"Really great BBQ and especially great for the west side.  Wonderful food.  We enjoy the casual and family style dining.  The only complaint is if you come with a group of six it can take a while from the delivery of your first meat until your ready to go sit down.  It can result in colder food than I prefer."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ! 
Anything from cole slaw to beans is so tasty. Old school picnic benches and tables for insides seating. The signs they have on the wall will remind you of a different time when gas was 19 cents a gallon. If you are coming here during the weekday for lunch come before the rush as the lines are out the door! But well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ordered a Brisket sandwich and drink. I got a completely plain bun with several slices of brisket on it, the sandwich was in a paperboard basket and then that was placed in what I guess was some kind of bottle crate. Why? I do not know. A tray would have been a better choice.

The brisket had a nice smoke ring and a good smokey taste, however it was on the dry side, I used the \"Bar-B-Que sauce\" not the sissy stuff. It was ok, but the sauce (not the least bit spicy) was in a glass bottle with a tiny spout like you would find on a bottle of olive oil so you had to shake the hell out of it to get any sauce. A squeeze bottle would be better and IF I ever go back, I would remove the useless spout.

The place is a little confusing as to where to go (to order) and has a real cheap redneck feel to it. The \"country store\" part was just beer, drinks, and candy bars.

Very limited sides, none of which I was interested in. 

I give it a \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Very delicious Bbq for a low price! Chicken is good but Prime Rib is addictive. Unique restaurant style as you order your meats and hot food and put on your own condiments ie mustard , ketchup. Service is fast and friendly. I ordered Potatoes, Prime Rib and .5 Chicken and spent $24 and was full for the day. Bbq sauce Sissy and Regular are delicious and spicy.  Sissy is less spicy and enjoyable. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night for dinner.  Tell them you are a first time visitor, and they will generously help with deciding by giving you samples.  We had the pork ribs, choice brisket and sausage.  Ribs and sausage were perfect.  Brisket was a little dry.  Sides were good.  They even threw in slices of bread at your request.  Overall a quality BBQ place.  Very reasonable prices.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and customer service outstanding. Just picked up food for a party we are hosting. Got to my car and it wouldn't start. Walked back inside and asked for help. Their manager, Chuck, didn't hesitate.  He walked outside, pulled his truck up to my car and helped me jump it. Took him 5 minutes but made a strong impression.  Keep hiring good people Rudy's!"}
{"text":"So frustrated with this place! We were so excited to try it and it has been on our very short list of restaurants to try for months, but my husband and I both work 60 hours a week and rarely have a time where we get off in time where they are open. So on Friday, we were so excited when we got off at 9:30 pm and their website clearly states they are closed at 10:30, so we drove 30 minutes to get there at 10:00 pm. We walked in and the guy says we are closed, it says so on the door. Well, we wouldn't know that it says that on the door because we have never been there before and the website clearly states they close at 10:30 pm, as well as on google. Horrible customer service to reject someone and say the time we close is on the door, when it states it online. They should really fix it online then if they changed it on the door, because who drives all the way there to look at the door for their times. I don't know how to post a screenshot of the times listed on their website, but I have it as proof. Having worked in the customer service industry for years, the better way to handle this after someone telling you they drove 30 minutes because it says online that you close at 10:30 and not at 10:00, would be to apologize and try to remedy the situation such as selling us what they had left (which they would have probably thrown away anyways) or just a plain old fashion apology would have sufficed instead of arguing and saying the time is on the door. Who cares? It's listed online, it's 2017, it's what people rely on is information online."}
{"text":"First of all, it is a a confusing mess to even take your order. Like what the heck? Am I in a deli or a restaurant? After all that confusion and money spent, we sit down to eat a flavorless meal. I've travelled the country and I have never had such disappointing bbq. It truly was a culinary letdown. They should be ashamed to call themselves a Texas bbq joint. By the way, it wouldn't hurt to put some flavor in your sides. Thanks."}
{"text":"The quintessential Texas experience that will amplify those nagging feelings you've had about why you never relocated to Austin.  I dare you to find me better BBQ at this price point anywhere in this vast Valley."}
{"text":"The service is good but everything else is mediocre at best.  The sauce and meat had little to no flavor.  I had the brisket and the other person I was with had the pulled pork sandwich and neither of them stood out."}
{"text":"In Chandler for some training.  1st visit Monday 6/4 for lunch had the turkey sandwich very good, great flavor and juicy.    Returned for dinner on the same day and had the brisket sandwich . Also very good, tasty, and moist. Will return one more time before I depart on Friday."}
{"text":"Excellent! First time here, so I kept it simple: pulled pork sandwich and order of creamed corn (just like Mamaw used to make it!) and new potatoes (bathed in butter!!). Everything was oustanding! Warning: It can be a little intimidating when you first step up to order, especially when it is busy. Make sure to tell them it is your first time and they will give you samples of the different kinds of meat, and help you through the process. Don't worry - You'll be chowing down on nom noms like an old pro in no time. So good!"}
{"text":"Apparently I didn't realize what a big deal it is that Chandler has a Rudy's.  I guess it is located in other states and is kind of a big deal.  Who knew?  I am a fan of Joe's in Gilbert so I was skeptical I would like Rudy's as much but I was surprised at how good it was.  

The ambiance is really cute.  It is cafeteria style and they will let you sample the meats to help with your decision which is a nice touch.  I got the smoked turkey and it was very tasty.  I would have liked to see some more sides offered.  That was the only thing I thought Joes was better in.  The service was very good, the restaurant is very clean and the food is good.  There are lots of sauce options offered at the table.  I can't wait to try some more meats here!"}
{"text":"have been dining here recently and this place is amazing the moist brisket is the way to go. also do not pass up the chocolate pudding on the way  to check out, its to die for. I just recently found out they have really cheap breakfast burritos which are also amazing they have tons of different flavors.this place rocks! Def try it out

 Also- they have loyalty cups, once you purchase a 2.00$ large you can bring it back and just pay the refill price! cant go wrong with sweet tea!

They have good local beer
And their loaded potatoes are a hidden gem on their menu it almost a meal in itself."}
{"text":"This place was just built right by me, so naturally, I was stoked to go! I had never heard of Rudy's but there seemed to always be the longest line ever to get in. Needless to say, I had to try it! Once I got inside, I was a little surprised... It was almost like a fast food kind of restaurant. You walk up to the counter to order and the seating is all bench styled open seating. Not super ideal but kind of open and friendly at the same time.

I'm not super big on spicy things and it turns out that even the least spicy thing there was, ultimately, too spicy for me... including the baked beans. But it was still pretty tasty. There was no real option to get any kind of veggie unless you wanted some okra or something random like that. 

Not my favorite place, but neat for something new and different."}
{"text":"Rudy's! This was always my go to bbq place when I lived in Texas.  We were traveling through Phoenix and Rudy's popped up on my Yelp radar....omg omg got to have some Rudys!

I love thier set up...when you walk in they have the country store and tacos. Usually you can stop by in the morning and choose from a variety of breakfast tacos.

Theres always an employee asking if this is your first visit to Rudy's.  It can be confusing for first timers.  As you walk the order line you can pick up a soda or beer from the cooler. Shiner Boch is big in Texas so that's why its represented in thier coolers. You can also get sweet or unsweetened tea and fountain drinks.

When it comes to brisket....never get lean it will not be pleasing. Always order the extra moist, it's got the best flavor and if you're lucky you'll get some bark (charred) . I like to make white bread sandwiches of the brisket with Cole slaw on top or pickles and onions. Pork ribs and pulled pork are awesome too.  The are plenty of cold and hot sides.  Your plate consists of a sheet of waxed paper.  A selection of sauces is on the table.

Come hungry and leave full...but leave room for cobbler and ice cream!"}
{"text":"I'm Not A BBQ Expert

I am no BBQ expert (I'm from New York, and I ain't gonna pretend) but I'd have to say on my first visit to Rudy's the quality and  taste of the food  wasn't bad, not the best BBQ around  but you could do worse. 

Rudy's Country Store has a nostalgic vibe, from the hand-sliced meat served  on brown paper to the large ice buckets that keep the beer and sodas cold. Rudy's dinning area is lined with long picnic tables covered in red and white plastic table clothes. The soft drinks are at a station where you serve yourself, as well as the condiment station with various sauces, pickles, and hot peppers.

On my first visit to Rudy's  I went for breakfast, yes BBQ for breakfast.  Rudys offers breakfast tacos ($1.50), served from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m.  I had eggs, potatoes, and chopped brisket with tomatillo salsa. The brisket was tender but a bit on the dry side, however,  a little tomatillo sauce  took care of that problem.   What I noticed most about the brisket is the overwhelming taste of cracked pepper.   The taste of the cracked pepper dominated the flavor of the meat. It was just to much cracked pepper for my liking. I think on my next visit I will go for lunch and try a sandwich.

The food is okay. I'm not a big fan of barbecue, so I wasn't that crazy about it, but my friends thought it was finger-lickin' good."}
{"text":"Rudy!  Rudy!  Rudy!  Rudy!  If you live anywhere near I-10, you've probably seen that eyesore of a red barn that is Rudy's BBQ.  It's a dining experience unlike any other in the Valley.  It's like a delicatessen, crossed with a picnic, and covered in BBQ sauce.  The BBQ is really good, but I learned a few things that will make my experience even better next time.

Tip #1:  Show up early for lunch.  It's not as packed as when it first opened, but we waited about 10 minutes to order at 11:45.  Wait until 12:15 and you'll have a long line and trouble finding seats.

Tip #2:  Understand what you're getting.  You can order sandwiches, but most people order meat by the pound.  The sign says $6.49 for a half pound of brisket, but you pay what it weighs.  My portion was over $7.  I wouldn't recommend the \"cutter's choice\" option.  I saved some pocket change, but my brisket didn't look as moist or as lean as my friends'.

Tip #3:  Order pint sides and share them among your friends.  It's better value.

They serve the food in what looks to be a wax paper lined milk carton.  After navigating the condiment bar (try the cherry peppers), you can look for a small wooden picnic table, or take up part of a large table covered with red and white table cloths.

As for the food itself, the brisket had a great smokey flavor, but it was dry in places, and had large hunks of fat.  I blame myself for ordering \"cutter's choice.\"  Rookie mistake.  The cole slaw was really good.  The cabbage was minced pretty fine, and it was sweet and creamy, but not too creamy.  The new potatoes were just roasted potatoes in butter.  They definitely needed salt, and the inch of melted butter in the bottom of the styrofoarm bowl was an unappetizing visual.  There were two bbq sauces on the table.  I liked the tangy, vinegary flavor.  One was supposed to be spicier than the other, but they tasted similar to me.  Both had kick.

I have some friends in Austin, TX that think Rudy's rivals Salt Lick BBQ, and I think they're crazy.  It's good, but it's not that good.  The smokey flavor of the brisket definitely stood out, though.  I'm looking forward to my next visit, when I can navigate the menu a little easier."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Rudy's BBQ on May day.  I worried about long lines but that didn't happen at 5pm on a Tuesday.  I figured they had a month to get their staff working efficiently.  We were greeted at the door and given small printed menus as they explained that the meats were sold by the half pound, there were cold sides in a large refrigerator case, drinks on a huge ice filled table and an order counter.  They place your order in a wax paper lined plastic basket, approximately 12\" by 18\" with 5\" sides.
We took a medium sized (pint) potato salad (3.69) and a small pudding (2.49) from the refrigerator case, and 2 bottles of IFC root beer (3.38) off the iced table and proceeded to the counter with the digital scale.  Ordered pulled pork and was charged for 0.58 lb of it at 5.79, don't know why they can't measure it out to the half pound listed at 4.99 they advertise. Also ordered beef brisket, the moist which is a bit more fatty but I heard the extra lean was too dry. They put over 3/4 of a pound on the scale and the girl asked if I wanted some taken off, which she did leaving 0.69 lb (8.96) The meats were great, moist, delicious, well smoked, some of the best BBQ we've had. Also ordered some hot sides, new potatoes small 1.99 (boiled or steamed peeled potatoes, chunked and floating in butter.  Nothing special, little flavor, needed lots of salt and pepper, won't order it again.  Sweet cream corn small 2.19 was overly sweet, needed lots of salt to counteract the sugar, won't order again.  The potato salad was fairly good, I'd order that again as it goes well with the meats.  My wife said the pudding (banana) was \"kinda bland and I wouldn't order it again\".  Total with tax was $31.00
A bit overpriced I think,  They threw in 8 slices of white and wheat bread to make sandwiches with, the bread was very fresh.  There were 2 kinds of BBQ sauce on the table, tomato/vinegar based, on mild, one slightly spicy, they were OK, not great. You could buy a 32 0z bottle for 8.50 if you desired.  Other than the quality and taste of the meats, nothing else stood out.  There are long wooden tables that could become uncomfortably crowded if they are very busy.  I think I might return to buy their meat and take it home, the brisket at 12.98 a lb and the pulled pork at 9.98 a lb.  I give them 4 stars because of how good the meats are. There were pickles, peppers and sweet onion slices available for the taking."}
{"text":"Great spot! Took the family there for lunch & the food was off the chain! The brisket moist is so tender & I've had turkey like theirs! Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"OK...I have to be fair.  Normally I don't update a review in less than a year, but I was getting my camera lens repaired at a shop right behind Rudy's.  My wife wanted to give them another chance.  So here I am.

That alone wouldn't be enough to get a new review out of me, but they apparently addressed the problem I highlighted last time.  This time the brisket had a wonderful smoky flavor.  Not overpowering, but very distinctly present.  This is more like the Rudy's I knew a year or more ago.  I'd say today was a 4-star meal, but I won't give them that for two reasons.  First, inconsistency.  Six months ago their meat had no smoke flavor at all.  Six months before that it did, and today it did.  I'd like more consistency and reliability in the quality of the meal.  And second, there was a coal in my green chili stew.  They tried to say it was just a \"burnt end\".  No, it was a piece of burned wood.  I know the difference.  However, to their credit they offered to replace the stew and gave us a gift card to come back.  I have to give management credit when they try to make something right.

Despite that one bit of wood, their stew really is great.  Perhaps the best thing they do.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"I ate at this place just the other day for the first time after a co-worker told me she had eaten there for three days in a row. I told my fianc√©e, \"Let's go to Rudy's\" and so we did. It was a bit pricey for what we ordered. We each got the baby back ribs, two small sides, and two medium drinks. The total was a little over $25, but it was definitely worth it.  The ribs were so peppery, a tad spicy, and had just the right amount of meat. My fianc√©e said the pinto beans were good, but after tasting my green chili stew, he made the comment that he should have ordered that. It's shredded pork, I believe, with green chili's, tomato, and many spices. I worked for six hours last night and my mouth kept watering just thinking about it. If I had a car, I'd be back ordering that stew. The sweet tea was sweet, but so refreshing since it's 110 outside."}
{"text":"This barbecue is awesome!  The green chile stew is a little spicy, but delicious and a must have.  The ribs were perfectly smoked and the meat fell off the bone.  The chicken was delicious as well.  The broker was a little dry, but we got the lean cut.  Next time we will try the moist.  The sweet creamed corn is another must have.  Highly recommend this place for your Texas style barbecue!"}
{"text":"First the good:  

The sweet tea is great.  When you find sweet tea around here it is usually outrageously sweet, this was not, it was perfectly sweetened and was not too we.  The potato salad was also quite good.  

Now the bad:

The way this restaurant is set up is horrible.  It is probably a safe bet that you will spend as long or longer standing in line than you will actually eating.  If you happen to come during an off time, you may only have to wait twenty minutes or so to order your food.  If you show up during a busy period, there is no telling how long you'll be standing in line.  I understand that the food is all pre made and in theory it should be possible to quickly move people through the line and to their seats.  For whatever reason it really does not work in practice.  There has to be a better way.

I get it, Texans love the wax paper thing.  That's great.  Here's the thing; try ordering the prime rib, carry it back to your picnic table and start cutting it up with one of their plastic knives.  If you are anything like me, once your plastic knife has cut through the wax paper and rubbed your steak around on the bare table a couple of times you'll decide the best approach is to just eat the steak with your hands.  Granted, the wax paper and plastic cutlery probably works fine with the rest of the menu, but it doesn't work at all with the prime rib.  

Despite all of the issues, I will probably be back.  My wife had the ribs and they were quite good, and I am betting that the brisket is great as well.  The fact is, there just aren't that many good BBQ restaurants in the area.  The prime rib was a bad choice, and that choice is really what lead to the bad experience.  I look forward to a better visit next time."}
{"text":"Try the chicken! They give you a taste before you buy. And the atmosphere is very casual. Love eating here."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in AZ. No fuss serving. Meat is served and charged per Lb."}
{"text":"Wonderful family friendly casual dining BBQ! Brisket was moist & tender. Turkey had lots of flavor. The cream corn & new potatoes were good but the potato salad we could have done without (tasted store bought). Overall great casual dining bd commitment to theme atmosphere! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this joint! The brisket is amazing, as is their creamed corn and green chile stew. I only gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the brisket can be inconsistent. The smokiness is always there, but some times its super soft and tender, other times rough and chewy. I guess it depends on who is working there that day, but it shouldn't!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. We stop every time we drive up from Tucson.  Mild sausage, pulled pork,& brisket. Very good."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Love the little bar with all the pickled sides. 

My favorite is their Baby Back ribs and Jalopeno sausages. Prime rib is good too but it gets cold too fast and it's not as good. I suggest asking them to heat up the bread. 

Their sauce is also amazing but it is on the spicy/peppery side so if you're a fan of the sweet bbq sauce, just be warned. 

Love their sweet tea and all the beer selection as well!"}
{"text":"Breakdown of what we ordered:
Cole slaw - good, definitely recommend.
Jalape√±o hot link (1/2) - not bad, no problem recommending.
Smoked potato (2) - loaded and still dry.  We didn't add meat to the potato and honestly this was the low point of the meal.  I would recommend skipping this menu item altogether.
Baby back ribs (1/2 pound) - delicious and recommend.
Brisket (cutter's choice) (1 pound) - delicious and recommend.  Cutter's choice just means you'll get some combination of moist and lean brisket.
Cream corn (pint) - outstanding!  You will not be disappointed.
Slice of pecan pie - pretty good but doubt you'll need it after ordering a bunch of meat.  I took a couple of bites and took the rest home.

Total with taxes was ~$56.  This place isn't cheap and definitely no frills however you're not going to be disappointed with any of their meat choices."}
{"text":"This a place to go if you like MEAT.  If you don't like meat then its not a good choice for you.  

So many choices for meat.. Its definitely a place to come back over and over.  Great atmosphere ... Just be warned... If you go around lunch time expect huge lines.  They really need a much bigger parking lot."}
{"text":"I love that this place gives you free samples, because I would have never ordered the creamed corn otherwise.. And man was that stuff the bombschizzle!  I can't wait to go back and get more! We also had the lean brisket, spicy chopped brisket, and beans.. and it was absolutely deeelicious!  We finished our perfect meal with the largest softest rice crispy treats.. Yummy! Now it's food-coma time!"}
{"text":"Delicious! But a little spendy. I've never dinned in i just order To-go. I recommend the moist brisket :)) also love the cream corn. If you like smoky bbq this is the place. If you don't- this is not your place"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place in the east valley.  I always order the meat by the pound and get 1/4 lb of lean brisket and 1/4 lb of smoked turkey.  Both are excellent.  The brisket is perfectly cooked, smokey and has a great \"pull\" to it.  The smoked turkey has an incredible spice rub and is super tender.

As for sides - get the creamed corn.  I never liked creamed corn until i had theirs.  
The green chili stew is very, very flavorful

My wife normally gets the pulled pork and enjoys it.  The kids like their smoked links.  

Only things we would stay away from going forward is the beans and their ribs.  both are ok but way better choices on the menu.

OH and the service, incredible.  Take someone with you and they immediate start offering samples."}
{"text":"Get the brisket, and get it moist.  It is delicious.  I liked almost everything BUT the pulled pork.  I really did not like that.  I loved the jalapeno sausage.  Rudy's barbecue sauce goes with everything just nicely.  

Get ready to eat really low-key, country backyard style.  No plates, just waxed paper and eating with your hands mostly. If that is not your kinda thing you will hate it."}
{"text":"Love the brisket moist sandwich (with burnt ends), the loaded baked potato, and the jalapeno sausage sandwich. Way better than Dicky's BBQ!"}
{"text":"Rudy's is a great place for some good sweet tea and BBQ anytime. This place is usually packed with people. The prices are fair and portions appropriate....

Worth a visit for sure..."}
{"text":"Very military friendly, staff is great. A little pricy when you look at what you paid for a lunch though"}
{"text":"This was a home style cooked meal! I'm from California and a little home sick from being a truck driver and needed some good home style bbq . It's not as good as my dads but it's close . I'm glad I stopped by and I will be back. Great food and great service also made me feel very welcome from the minute I walked in and also leaving."}
{"text":"Loved the baby back ribs, moist brisket, sausage and potato salad. Cheap bottled beers and sodas and the atmosphere is great. The only thing we weren't sold on was the new potatoes just steamed and unseasoned. 





We are definitely coming back. Meat is weighed and sold by the pound but really isn't that pricey."}
{"text":"Saw the USA Today article on this chain and thought it would be worthwhile to check out.  First, this is a stand in a line to order place.  The line did move along rather well and we only were in line for 10 minutes on a Sunday at noon.  There were four of us and we had one 1/2 lb. rib order, two pulled pork sandwiches, a brisket sandwich, several coleslaws, four drinks, and a bag of chips.  FIFTY BUCKS!!!  Wow, I thought that was high for what is essentially a carry-out restaurant.  As for the food, if this is considered good Texas food no wonder those people are so angry!  My brisket was flavorless and so dry I had to douse the meat in their BBQ sauce to help it go down.  The sandwiches were served on grocery store hamburger buns that fell apart almost immediately.  The coleslaw was also dry and completely unseasoned.  The pulled pork was just a tad better but neither sandwich contained a hint of smoke flavor.  I get more smoke flavor out of my Weber grill.  Two levels of BBQ sauce are at the table.  The regular one is so-so.  The other is condescendingly labeled \"Sissy Sauce.\"  Not everyone is in to spicy food and they should not be humiliated for different taste levels.  I understand the seating concept is supposed to be casual country.  But, it is so loud you can barely carry on a conversation with table mates.  I'd recommend visiting a place like Lulu's before you head here."}
{"text":"This is a new location and I only had the breakfast tacos.  When I lived in Austin, TX I ate breakfast tacos a lot.  These were not as good as the tacos I remember, but still decent.  The Barbecue however is very good in Austin and I am sure it is the same here.  I loved the brisket!!!  If you live in or around Chandler, I would definitely check Rudy's out; superior barbecue to anything else in AZ."}
{"text":"Really glad to see Rudy's move into AZ. I ate there all the time in Austin.

They would get 5 stars if they'd add some sides that were reasonably healthy... green salad, steamed veggies, etc... I NEVER eat there, I always get take out since I want some side that won't make me gain 5 lbs.

Come on owners... buy a clue here!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Arizona!! The concept is interesting. Customers stand in line, and choose what they order by weight. When you get up to the register, they cut the prepared meat according to the weight you want. In the line, they have pre-made sides and your choice of beer or soda. This concept is great because you have your food right away and can order exactly how much you want! The atmosphere is really cute too! It looks like a barn outside and has picnic tables on the inside. Everything is pretty much self-serve (including cleaning up). The prices are reasonable, and the location is good (right off the 10 freeway). We always enjoy going here."}
{"text":"We tried it all, brisket, ribs, cream corn, beans & stew, it was all excellent.  The cream corn is a must!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here visiting from the Northern California. Was really awesome to go to an actual BBQ spot. The set up was nice and the line moved very quickly, I really enjoyed the experience. Have never seen anything like this in Nor Cal. Was excellent, wish we had one here."}
{"text":"Finally!  After spending four years in Texas during college I thought that I was deemed to inferior quality BBQ until I made it back.  However Texas has come to us!  The Chandler location is every bit as good as the original outside on San Antonio.  This place is now the only BBQ restaurant in AZ as far as I'm concerned.  Joe's is pretty good, but it doesn't even compare to Rudy's."}
{"text":"Solid, solid, solid bbq.  I've eaten at Rudy's in Austin and Dallas.  While this location might not be quite as good as the others, it's still worth the drive and waiting in line.  I recommend the 1/2 lb wet brisket, new potatoes, corn, and a Shiner.  And a few napkins, and plenty of sauce"}
{"text":"Can I give 6 stars? No frills BBQ that's great; friendly staff, and inexpensive breakfast in the morning. Lunch and dinner are a little pricey, but the quality of the food indicates why. Great for families! Safe and clean environment, where wandering toddlers and excited squeals will be welcomed or at the least tolerated."}
{"text":"Im only writing this review because I disagree with the 1 star reviews....Just tried this place and had a great experience!  We were not sure where to start when ordering,  but our cashier was great....offered samples and explained we can make our own menu items.  I was going for the pork loin but after sampling the pulled pork and spicy chopped beef we decided we must have it! I normally love bbq for the sauces and altho I did taste the sauces...I did not need them! The meat was that good. Coleslaw was good and fresh, potato salad was good but not homemade and the beans were ok-but I am not a fan of beans anyway. Loved that atmosphere and a  couple $3 beers.  We will be back even tho we live a ways away. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"My husband and I popped in with family we were visiting, whom are regular fans of Rudy's. We ordered the moist turkey, half chicken, baked potato, potato salad, and banana pudding....yes, we eat ALOT. Lol.

The chicken was what you'd typically expect for a rotisserie/BBQ chicken -moist and yummy. The turkey was very moist and delicious...my husband said it reminded him of his homemade thanksgiving turkey. That's a good thing in our house. The baked potato was very typical -potato, butter, cheese, and whip cream. It was pretty overpriced for something as average and boring as a cubicle bound 40 year old accountant. The banana pudding was sweeter than newborn baby's first giggle. Half whip cream, half pudding, and a banana slices -yum. 

What we love most about Rudy's is the excellent service!! When we told our cashier that this was our first time in, he brought us samples of turkey, brisket, and spicy chop. My husband and I will definitely come back because of the great service! :)"}
{"text":"Super... Sweetie.. Sucking great BBQ chopped spicy beef; 1st outing since May. Sadie loves their smoked Turkey. Got my PBR...Out on their nice shady patio"}
{"text":"The building looks nice from the outside, so I figured if they spent that much time making the building look good, the food must be outstanding. It isn't.

I asked for a sample of the meat, and they brought me a sample of turkey and a sample of brisket. Neither of which I was considering ordering. So, I ordered the pulled pork, half a chicken and baby back ribs.

Little did I know that they completely ruin these meats by over-seasoning them. For example, the pulled pork tasted like someone dumped a bottle of mustard in it. Turns out, that's pretty much how they make it. The baby back ribs had so much black pepper (and I really like black pepper) it was burning my mouth.

Why would any 'chef' disguise the natural taste of smoked meats with seasoning? It completely ruins the flavor of the meat. Offer the sauces and pepper at the table and let the customer season it how they like. Don't force the customer to eat food seasoned the way YOU like it. Who does that? They take a perfectly good piece of meat and drown it in seasoning to the point where you can't taste anything but the seasoning? Seems like they are trying to cover something up. You know, in the old days they used a lot of salt, especially on spoiling meat (in the days before refrigeration). That's what this meat tasted like... like they had no refrigeration and needed to over-season it to cover the flavor. Why else would a chef do that?

The employees were very friendly, but you do have to do everything yourself. There is no wait staff and they have one of those arrogant signs on the wall that says \"Your mother doesn't work here. Please clean up after yourself!\"

That's all fine and good to tell an employee, but as a customer, that's just plan rude. Do you think that sign makes any difference? I always clean up after myself, sign or no sign. Others don't. Sign or no sign. They are basically saying you have to clear the table for their next customer. What's my incentive to do that?

Here is a quick summary of the food and prices from our receipt:

Small potato salad: $2.09
Small cole slaw: $2.09
2 medium drinks ($1.79 each): $3.58
1/2 BBQ Chicken: $5.99
1/2 lb of BBQ pulled pork ($9.98 per pound): $5.19
1/2 lb of BBQ baby back ribs (4 ribs - $14.98 per pound)): $7.79
Small cream corn (bland - no seasoning at all. Had to add salt): $2.39
Small peach cobbler - $2.19

Total: $31.31
Tax: $3.22
Grand total: $34.53

There is no one to tip and no tip jar. So at least they aren't greedy. The country store looks like a poor mans version of Cracker Barrel. Not much in there. Not sure what anyone would possibly buy there that you can't get at World Market or other department stores that have a larger selection and cheaper prices.

I really wanted to like this place, but they have given me little reason return. If I heard there was a BBQ chain worse than Famous Dave's, I wouldn't have believed it.  My stomach is severely upset (probably from the mustard sauce on the pulled pork. Mustard makes me nauseous and I had no idea anyone would even conceive of forcing the public to eat it without any warning that its not simply PULLED PORK. My guess is that my ribs and pulled pork were probably delicious before they ruined it with the seasonings.

The chicken was good, but its hard to screw up chicken. Lucky for me the seasoning was only on the skin. The chicken still tasted like chicken underneath the skin.

The dogs got the pulled pork. They seemed to enjoy it. Glad someone did."}
{"text":"Love the ribs!!! Also don't miss the banana pudding. This store was almost as good as the one in Austin but thankful they opened one closer to us!"}
{"text":"Great local spot if you find yourself in Phoenix.  I went with my softball team and everyone was quite impressed.
If you read my reviews, you will note that the food and the experience are equally important to me.  In this case they both measured up well!
The hostess was very gracious to us \"rookies\", explaining the process clearly.  It is best described as organized chaos!  The food is served like a fast food restaurant - walk up counter, walk away with your meal.  But it is anything but fast food.
I had the brisket lean (they also offer brisket moist) and found it to.be good - not great but I would order it again.  My buddy said the pulled pork was extremely good.  They offer a variety of sauces at the table but don't be afraid - none were particularly fiery.
The seating is first come-first serve at long tables - so don't expect private seating, although one section does offer a few picnic tables for 4-6 people.
Overall a very enjoyable night with good food and good atmosphere.  One last note - we arrived at 5:45 pm on a Saturday and walked right in.... but by 7 pm the line was out the door and down the sidewalk (with parking equally congested).  Go early!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! The smoked potato with brisket to die for! Family style fun! The flavors of BBQ sauce so good! Will be returning again and again!"}
{"text":"Maybe I've had too much good BBQ in the Carolina's, Memphis, Texas and Kansas that makes me biased. Picked up a pound of their \"Moist Brisket\" to take home and pair with my own sides. The brisket was average at best.

I have dined in twice at this location because it's very close to where I live and I have high hopes. The price is not commensurate to a restaurant where, you stand in line to order your food, get served in plastic baskets with butcher paper, eat with plasticware and when all done, clean up after yourself.

Yes I have been to original places where that is how it's done and I don't mind at all. As long as the food is outstanding and not mediocre. This Rudy's franchise location has mediocre food at best.

If you want to taste REAL BBQ try Little Miss BBQ on University. Mind you if you don't get there early enough they may be sold out. And you might have to wait quite awhile in line but for the same money or less in most cases you will be rewarded with OUTSTANDING BBQ. And you will never to be able to be a enjoy a place like Rudy's again."}
{"text":"2nd trip not as delicious as the first. Brisket was tough and I ended up throwing most of it away.

I'll chalk it up to just a bad batch and try again."}
{"text":"Food just doesn't have the flavor that suits my taste.  One and done.  Won't be back.  Ever."}
{"text":"Always a delicious BBQ option when in the Southwest. I really like having the options of beef, pork, turkey, and chicken. They have great side options as well. 

Great for work lunches, family outings, or just a good overall meal. Quality of the meat is always top notch, and it's great to be able to order by the quarter pound or by the rib. 

Sweet tea is always on point, as well as condiment options. 

They are great and always relatable. Never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Often imitated, never duplicated... except it's a chain :) Felt exactly like the Rudy's I've been to and the clientele was nearly exactly the same as well! haha. Make this place popular, guys. They'll even give you samples - what's there to lose?

And if I may, get creamed corn because I actually drove from California to get this today, Arizonians. Jealous!

They also sell plenty of Shiner Bock and Blue Bell ice cream here. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything about this place.  I have been to BBQ places before with the 'grab a tray and load up' technique before, but for some reason this one was cooler than most.  I got a side of their green chili stew - and it's just something I could probably eat every day.  For meats I got the moist brisket and jalapeno hot link - both were on point.  

Their house sauce was perfectly spicy and the service was friendly and quick.  So far - this is my favorite BBQ in Arizona!  It doesn't suck that it's not all that far from work either - so I'll be back sooner than later.  I didn't spend any time in the country store, but I will probably be purchasing some of their sauce next time I go!"}
{"text":"I'm not normally one to crave BBQ so when some friends chose here for a Sunday dinner I was actually excited to try it out. The bf kept telling me not to expect too much so expectations were low, but we ordered a half pound of moist brisket and a half pound of turkey to share. We also got some complimentary wheat and white bread slices. They also have a station where you can fill up on onions, jalape√±os, cherry peppers, pickles, etc. I always like to have a contrasting crunchy vegetable when I'm eating meat so it's nice that I'm not forced to order a side. Although I will admit I wish I had ordered the creamed corn since our friends did and it was DELICIOUS. I felt no guilt getting two helpings of this from them. (I'm a sucker for corn). 

They have a few different sauces at the tables which include BBQ sauce and hot sauce. I looooved the combo of a piece of brisket dipped in BBQ sauce/hot sauce, piece of bread, pickled veggies, and a bite of creamed corn. I was glad we didn't order too much since I definitely would not have stopped eating. 

At the time we went it wasn't too packed and if you've never been there before (just me) they tell you how ordering works. You get your order in a big plastic bin lined with parchment paper. At the station with the veggies you can also pick up napkins and rip off parchment paper to cover your table with. Overall would recommend if you're in the mood for BBQ in this area!"}
{"text":"Pricey for bbq but it was good. I left satisfied. I will pass on the potato salad next time. I have eaten here for catering before and was eager to try. Again every is by the lb or side orders...wish they had combo meals. Next time i will try the loaded potato with meat...looked hearty and delicious.  Cream corn my favorite"}
{"text":"Tried Rudy's on my trip to Arizona. I heard this place was pretty popular in Texas so thought I would give it a try. I wasn't too hungry and they let you order 1/2 pounds of meat which was great. When I walked in, it had a very Texas vibe with benches for seating and self serve condiments/water/etc. They also had a plethora of bottled sodas that you can purchase for $1.99 each. 

I ordered a 1/2 lb of moist brisket and 1/2 lb of baby back ribs. The brisket was delicious. It was my first time eating it, but it was very well cooked and the meat was so tender that it melts in your mouth. I'm used to meat being really well marinated, so I felt like the meat was pretty bland. There was bbq sauce on the tables that people used for the meat and it was really good. It gave the meat a perfect spicy kick that wasn't too crazy. The baby back ribs weren't too good. I could say that I've had way better. The meat didn't come off the bones like some of the baby back ribs that I've had. The meat wasn't too tender and was pretty chewy. I also thought it lacked some flavor. 

I would say the brisket is the definite thing to get here. It was very reasonably priced and super delicious."}
{"text":"First time I had Rudy's BBQ was in TX and can't stop thinking about the deliciousness.  When I discovered there's one in AZ, I just had to stop by. Although I was skeptical and wasn't sure if the taste would be the same as TX, I'm happy to say that it is!! 

It was my husband's first time eating at Rudy's and he also loved it!  The atmosphere was lively and smelled like good BBQ.  The food was inexpensive, meats sold by the half pound. We had the moist briskets, baby back ribs, cole slaw and banana pudding - all delicious. Their original bbq sauce is a bit spicy (which I like a lot) but they offer a sissy sauce for those who don't like spicy. 

They also gave us samples of the pulled pork and turkey - all very tasty and delicious. We love Rudy's BBQ!"}
{"text":"I must admit, I'm not much of a meat eater. I always get the same thing here, jalapeno sausage, corn, and a beer or a sangria soda. As a life-long sausage eater, I consider it one of the best I've ever eaten anywhere, on two continents. My husband is the \"real\" meat eater of the family and he was not much impressed by the prices, or quality. However, for me it is all about the ambiance. I know it is a chain restaurant, but the whole place has just a cool vibe. Even the parking lot smells delicious! (By comparison, most restaurants parking lots just smell vile and off-putting). When I lived in Houston, I frequently ate at places just like this. Maybe even a Rudy's. The place is just a little slice of home in a world full of stuck-up and faux French places (La Madeline, I'm looking at you). I wish they had better bread, though."}
{"text":"We tried this location after experiencing Rudy's a few years back in the San Antonio area. We were not disappointed at all. The taste and quality was as expected. Fair pricing good value for an authentic BBQ restaurant. Would definitely go back if in the area."}
{"text":"1. I like the look of the place. It's like a big open barn, with picnic tables covered with all-to-familiar red and white table clothes. Everything about this place is redneck, and I love it. They have a theme and they nail it.
2. I like the throwback glass bottles of pop/soda or your choice of an assortment of different beers in ice-filled tubs. And if you like getting refills, you can choose to get fountain drinks. They really advertise Big Red, which I find interesting, as I've never seen it in fountain drink form, and it's a personal favorite. 
3. I REALLY like that they offer free samples of different meats at the counter, and they are generous portions for samples. 
4. I kind of like the prices. Around $5 for a sandwich,  which is neither a great deal nor a rip-off. It does contain a lot of meat, and is of higher quality than a Subway $5 footlong. I tried the pulled pork sandwich. It was delish.
5. I like how they have a condiment bar and offer two enormous slightly different flavored bottles of BBQ sauce at every seat. The sauces are good too.
6. I like how they don't imply that you're supposed to tip. I dislike when restaurants where you order and grab your own tray have tip jars or tip line on the receipt. Rudy's does neither.

I was a little turned off by one of the staff members. As we exited, I talked to one of the cooks outside and told him how much we enjoyed the food. I then offered him a $25 gift card to the company I myself am partnered with as a token of gratitude, to which he handed it back and said no thanks. I found this kind of offensive, as we'd just eaten here and complimented his work. If he wasn't interested in my offer, he could have slid it into his pocket and given it to someone else. Anyway, the food was good enough that we'll probably come back again."}
{"text":"Rudy's is a pretty decent place to get a BBQ Sandwich.  

Pros:  -There is sauce a-plenty and they are all pretty tasty
            -Creamed Corn is OUT OF THIS WORLD 
            -Big space with plenty of seating
            -Location is easy to find and near lots of shopping

Cons: -Service is a bit unprofessional flirting and weird comments abundant
           -There are no french fries (BBQ without fries is kind of un-American)
            -\"General Store\" is pretty lame.  Nothing like a Cracker Barrel.  
           
I say try it.  If for no other reason than that freaking amazing creamed corn!  I know this sounds weird.  As a rule I am not even a big fan of creamed corn, but WOW!  This stuff is GOOD."}
{"text":"Watched an evening show of King Arthur, and after the movie we were looking for some place open late. Stopped by Rudy's because it was open until 10:30pm, yesss! 
I ordered the steamed potato with moist brisket. The potato was the size of my head and steamed to perfection. It also comes loaded if that's what you wish for. I had butter sour cream and cheese in addition to the smothering of the moist meat. It was so amazing it was stupid! The amount of food you get for $6.99 is unreal and I am hard pressed to find another establishment that could offer such greatness. Me and my big eyes and empty stomach, ordered a small side of creamed corn to accompany the life sized potato. Note to self: The potato is enough for two meals on its own. The creamed corn ain't right either. This stuff is so good when you eat it you hear this heavenly music play. Overall the service at Rudy's was as amazing as the food. It's a super chill place to get full at and if you like the smell of meat, this is your new favorite hangout. 
PS. My SBL (sexy bearded lover) ordered the lean brisket and all he did was make meat eating noises and smile."}
{"text":"Food is very dry and bland. Did not like anything and we ordered just about everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Agreed this is good BBQ. A little spendy. Not cheap. But real tasty. The family meal is the bomb but again not cheap.  The loaded potato is my favorite. Yum!!"}
{"text":"The first time I had Rudy's BBQ was in Texas on a business trip. I had hoped then that we would find them outside of Texas.  A couple of years later, they opened one in Chandler.  I have been to this one at least three times while on business trips and they have never failed me.  I took my kids with me and they absolutely loved the baby back ribs, the briskets, and the creamed corn.  I wish we had one in the SF Bay Area!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! I love their turkey, green chile stew, peach cobbler, and barbecue sauce!! I just tried their breakfast tacos this morning and they are to die for especially with their bbq sauce! 

If you're health conscious do not eat the breakfast tacos! One taco contains 89% of your daily intake of saturated fats and cholesterol!.....yikes!!"}
{"text":"Yuk!!! Extremely disrespectful to call this BBQ. The guys across the street are just a tad better but still not worth your time. If you want better BBQ drive the 2 extra miles East to Famous Daves at Chandler Mall or 2 miles North to Honey Bears. My entire family ate here tonight so I got to taste a wide variety of their selection. The sausage was the only thing with flavor (no surprise). All the meats tasted like smoked cardboard. No flavor, no rings nothing resembling BBQ. Add a side of potato's and you might think you were eating at a hospital or senior living center, bland bland bland."}
{"text":"Rudy's is a great BBQ joint and it has a good variety of various meats. Depending on what cuts you like, the prices will vary and the better the meat meant the more the price but not by much. They also had the perfect sides to go with your juicy and succulent BBQ. I perfectly enjoyed the brisket moist because the extra fat on that piece added extra flavor. In addition to this, I also got a side of corn on the cob and cole slaw and it made the BBQ all come together. In total, I probably paid ~$15 and I think it was reasonable for what I got. An important thing that all BBQ places need to have are their own special sauces and this place did have that. I always enjoy drenching my cut of meats in those sauces. There wasn't any real downside of Rudy's but I do wish that they offered a variety of meats for a cheaper price. When I come to these types of places, I enjoy sampling different meats because each place has a distinct flavor that shows on their food."}
{"text":"I always see this place packed but have to say, outside of the prime meat, the rest as pretty flavorless and not worth the price. I believe good bbq is simmered in a tasty sauce or the near should be seasoned well enough to make up for adding your own. I just didn't love it."}
{"text":"The BBQ probably the best in Phoenix.  I don't like giving anybody 5 stars but they absolutely deserve it.  In this case they do.  You won't be disappointed if you came here for lunch or dinner. 

The setup it's interesting.  It is kind of like a casual picnic.  Very roomy inside and comfortable."}
{"text":"Nom. Nomnomnom. Also, NOM.

Moist brisket. Prime rib. Ribs, my gods, the RIBS. The sides - tater salad, banana pudding, peach cobbler - tasty little scoops of bliss.

Rudy's sause [sic] is amazing, but I find a little goes a long way. The other night I had the moist and babies; one cup of sause was enough. The dry rub is wonderfully savory.

Service has always been excellent, even when it's an obvious noob on the till. Being greeted by cute girls in tight jeans is a nice added bonus.

So much better than the place next door. So. Much."}
{"text":"Someone recommended this establishment to my husband since we are always looking for new places to eat. We live in Mesa so it was a bit of a drive for us but that's nothing new.
We dined with our 2 children on a week night.
Overall we felt like the food was comparable to Joe's BBQ in Gilbert & Dickey's BBQ in Mesa. Therefore, for us, we would prefer those other restaurants because they are closer. Also, we love the corn & chocolate chip cookies at Joe's and we love the mac & cheese and free ice cream at Dickey's. 
We did enjoy the red cream soda at Rudy's & their take home cups. Ironically, the cups at Dickey's are also take home & Joe's serves red cream soda too. 
For those who live in the area I'm sure it is a great place for them.
My husband recommends the brisket. The kids & I always get pulled pork sandwiches & they were good."}
{"text":"Rudy's is the among best.  We drive 40 minute to enjoy their brisket, ribs, pulled pork.  We love their service and their food. Real Texas BBQ as judged by a Jersey Girl!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! I must say that it's pretty impossible  for me to find a place I love baby back ribs place... This place did wonderful of it! Potato salad is definitely  from the south!"}
{"text":"I love the courtly store! They have all of the \"old school\" candy and sodas. I love the pulled pork and the cream corn! They have sweet tea which always pairs good with BBQ. They have rolls of paper for you to cover the tables before you \"pig out\". My dad loves coming here. My only complaint is the last few times I went the banana pudding wasn't fresh. Brown bananas and soggy wafers. But no other complaints"}
{"text":"Rudy, Rudy, RUDY....

I don't know which will make that name more famous, that ex-fighting Irish inspiration or this slow-cooked, smoked deliciousness.

This ain't a sticky sweet BBQ sauce kind of a joint.  The meat brings most of the flavor, the sauces just add a bit of heat and spice.  Brisket as tender as a Jane Austen novel.  Portions as big as Texas.  Prices fit for Arizona.  

I'm already starting the Rudy chant for my next visit."}
{"text":"They have a take-out line as well as a dine-in line in two completely different parts of the restaurant, which I think is very well-planned. If you're dining in, you order your food at the counter. The line can get pretty long, but they have many cashiers and an efficient food serving set-up so the line moves quickly. The line is partitioned by beverages/beverage holders that you can pick up as you're waiting in line. They have the various specialty sodas, pre-cupped wines. You can also purchase a cup from the cashier for fountain beverages. Desserts are available in a refrigerator at the very front of the line. They have the usual meat options including brisket, pork, chicken, sausage. They also have a bunch of sides from which you can choose. Food is ordered by weight and listed pricing was  by 0.5lbs. I ordered few items but only pricing I could remember was $7.15/half pound lean brisket. I thought it was pretty reasonable and remember thinking that about the remainder of the food options. The food itself was was pretty tasty! The brisket was very juicy, and the pulled pork had a very distinct flavor. It was sweet but peppery. I thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered the chocolate pudding, banana pudding, and pecan pie. If there was one con to this place, it would be the desserts. I thought they were humdrum in taste.

Seating options are plentiful and well-kept. When a customer left, staff would come shortly after to ensure the table was clean. They also walked around and removed trash during our meal. As we were ordering, the cashiers wiped down the counter between customers and even the food serving counter was repeatedly wiped. I appreciate the attention to cleanliness!

The employees were all extremely helpful and kind. We were acknowledged at every point of our visit, which particularly impressed me since we were there when it was rather busy."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided that bbq sounded good, I pulled up yelp and found this place with good reviews.  The building itself is really fun and innovative, I loved the whole feel and atmosphere.  All of the employees were friendly and seemed to be enjoying their jobs, which is always nice to see.  

I'm going to keep this short and simple.  Come here for the meat and skimp on the sides.  I liked that they were willing to give you samples of the meat so you could pick what you liked the best; we ended up with both lean and moist beef brisket and pork ribs.  For sides we got corn on the cob, coleslaw and baked beans.  The corn almost ruined the experience for me.  I saw the woman pull a corn on the cob on a stick out of some container and pour two laddles of melted butter over it....sick, but that wasn't even the worst part about it.  Once we sat down to eat I decided to start the meal off with the corn, I took one bite and thought it tasted really odd.  Visually you could see this wasn't fresh.  I had my fiance take a bite of it and he got a really disgusted look on his face, looked at the bottom of the corn and showed me a huge brown ring.  They served ROTTEN corn.  Ugh!  Thankfully the meat was delicious and saved this place from a 1 star review.  The beans and coleslaw were both decent but tasted store bought."}
{"text":"This place is nearby and a real gem. The brisket is delish. I can't praise it enough. I make awesome pulled pork, and don't need bbq turkey, so it is the brisket, ANY variety, that we indulge in. We don't care for the sides, bland, uninteresting, bread (yuck), BUT did I tell you about the brisket?! We usually just take home a couple pounds, then go buy some GOOD rolls, corn, baked beans, or salad. They USED to give scraps for our dogs, but they have stopped that practice. We are SO disappointed, especially our 2 dogs!! I hope they go back to scraps for our 4-legged friends. We will continue to buy their brisket. It is great for parties or a quick meal and excellent for leftovers. Even for a pinic basket for a nice hike in South Mountain."}
{"text":"Spontaneous stop on my way home with the thought of potato salad in mind. Instead of potato salad I ordered additional items, 2 lbs. Smoked Turkey, Beans, Potato Salad, and Peach Cobbler. I spent roughly around $60.Smoked Turkey was good, tender and flavor full. Beans I was not impressed, it was bland and it tasted and looked like it was sitting for a while. I enjoyed the potato salad. Lastly, the peach cobbler was terrible. 2 our 4 items were good. We didn't eat there so I can't share about the service. Pick up information: Easy access, friendly, nice packaging and all items were packed nicely in a huge Rudy's brown bag."}
{"text":"Great way to start the weekend. Lunch at Rudy's with a friend. You know the food is good when the line reaches the front door. Went for pork ribs and coleslaw today. The rib meat melted with each bite and the slaw was fresh. This may be my favorite meal of the weekend."}
{"text":"tourist trap, and a chain from texas, pre made bbq sauce from from factory but it is good bbq and the side are good and so are the desserts, you should try if you like bbq.  must get the prime rib, moist brisket, Banana Pudding. the baby backs are ok."}
{"text":"I have been going to eat at Rudy's for many years and have yet to have a bad meal. Their brisket is the best you can find, their sauce is the boss and the cream corn can't be beat! I love that they do a family-style that allows for you to visit with family and friends while enjoying the delicious food. To top it off their staff is always friendly and welcoming you and their manager Marcus is one of the most personable people you'll ever meet! If you're in the mood for some barbecue in a casual setting this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"After waiting for this amazing place to open I finally made it in and I can say that it was well worth the wait. I have never been to a Rudy's location that I didn't like this one included. If you have never been to a Rudy's before then I highly recommend you try it. If you are looking for a fine dining experience then this is not the place for you. Rudy's is a place for families to get together and enjoy some good BBQ in a family style, self serve setting. The brisket is succulent, the chicken is delish, and the sauce is the boss!!!"}
{"text":"Always a crowd pleaser with those who love to eat meat.  This place serves Texas-style BBQ. The meat is smoked in an onsite slow cooker, so it is always quite tender.  My personal favorite has always been the extra-moist brisket, but this last batch was so fatty, I wish I hadn't ordered it at all. Other family favorites include: the lean brisket which is slightly drier than the \"extra-moist\" because there is no fat on it; the smoked turkey; and best of all, the jalapeno sausage link.

Save some space for the sides. Potato salad, coleslaw and beans can all be bought in different sized containers to satisfy your hunger level/group size. The corn on the cob is worth getting your teeth all jammed with string. If you still have room for dessert, you can indulge in their banana pudding.

When arriving, get in the snake line. Yep, just like an amusement park and be prepared for your mouth to be entertained. Grab a bucket and fill it up with the longneck bottles of beer or root beer sitting on ice in the line aisle. As you near the front of the line, grab your sides in the open fridge. Be sure to study the big menu board too, so you'll know what to get as you approach the counter. Most of the meats have to be ordered as a 1/2 or whole pound, but they will also prepare a sandwich for you. You can get white or wheat sandwich bread. If you are in a large group, get half a loaf or more. All the fixings are slabbed onto butcher paper on a tray.

Wooden picnic tables and benches can be found both inside and outside on the covered patio. You will find butcher paper dispensers on the wall, so you can line your table surface. It's easier than plates to wad up and toss at the end of the meal. Napkins are also found in mounted dispensers on the wall. Each table has a caddy of sauces made by Rudy's which complement your meal; although the sign of well-prepared meat is that which doesn't require being smothered in sauce, but it can be nice to add heat and enhance the flavor. There is a condiment trough in the middle of the restaurant where you can load up on pickles, onions, jalepenos, lemon, as well as bags to take leftovers home.

Drinks...if you buy a tall Rudy's cup, you can bring it back the next time you visit the restaurant for free refills. Just don't forget your cup! Both sweetened and unsweetened iced tea are available along with the usual Coca Cola soda offerings.

This chain restaurant is a personal favorite since my days of going to the original location off 360 in Austin, Texas. I'm glad they have opened locations in the  neighboring states of AZ and NM, so I can enjoy it anywhere in the southwest."}
{"text":"Great Texas style BBQ.  I like the sausage or chicken the best with lots of Rudy's sauce and jalape√±os"}
{"text":"What a fun experience on top of some seriously yummy eats! I love the tubs of bottled drinks flanking the line, the condiments, the meat scales! They let you taste a bit before ordering like they do at Chino Bandito and I have to say - I really respect a place that confident! Went with friends and got to taste a bit of everything else - pork ribs, brisket, jalapeno sausage... creamed corn, potato salad, coleslaw, new potatoes. I really loved the creamed corn and potato salad. The pork ribs were my main dish, and I cleaned the bone. These were seasoned during smoking, not glazed like I'd have preferred, but still delicious with my choice of bbq sauce from their array of offerings. We left a mess across their wide picnic table seating and didn't feel bad about it. :-)"}
{"text":"I recieved a suggestion to visit  this place.  At first I didn't realize it was a chain, but now that I do, I still would visit again if I visit the airport, otherwise it's a long  drive.

The staff was friendly and joked with you when you came in. The food was ok.  I love the real smoke flavor, but couldn't get over the slight lighter fluid flavor that came through in the meat.  My buddy agreed, but all in all it was decent barbeque for a city lacking in any specific genre of food beyond Mexican.

I bought some texas beer and went home, happy tummy."}
{"text":"Finally a place worth for briskets!!! Get the moist!"}
{"text":"First time here, we are from California but we were in town for a baseball tournament and team wanted to eat here. My husband had the pull pork sandwich and I had the turkey sandwich. They were both amazing. I was skeptical to order turkey at a bbq place but they told me its one of their most popular sandwiches. Glad I did, it was so juicy and tender I really enjoyed it. My son and husband both had to go back and order another pull pork sandwich it was that good. I would defiantly come back again next time i'm in town."}
{"text":"I love this place.  They smoke everything & it's totally fresh.  They are friendly,  fast, courteous & the employee's know their stuff.  The manager gave me an explanation of the layout. I sampled a few of the meats WOW.  You have come & try it out."}
{"text":"Really great food and massive portions! Thankfully they have bags to bring home the leftovers :) Especially lived the pulled pork and the creamed corn. Also, the woman who took our order was SO nice! We told it was our first time there and she went back and got us samples and guided us through how to order. I highly recommmend!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Came to AZ for vacation and my husband took me here. From beginning to end this place was great. Gave us samples to try, staff was helpful and friendly. We tried a couple different things my favorites was the pulled pork and ribs. This is by far one of the best BBQ places I've been to. Definitely, recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I am not from Texas but I know good BBQ when I taste it. This is not good. This is gross with a fancy wrapper. There are no lunch specials everything is by the half pound. If you go at lunch time as I did its packed and loud. I ordered moist brisket. It's not moist it's dry with fat hanging on it and the fat has no flavor. On top of that the BBQ sauce is gross; it had powerful vinaigrette like flavor. The only thing that was good was the potato salad. Do yourself a favor and pass on this place."}
{"text":"I loves me some barbecue! This was my first visit to Rudys and it was BOMB! Driving up to this place you can smell the the smokiness and barbecue aroma in the air. 

We arrived just in time before it got busy and the lines long. The menu was simple with just meats and sides. I had the 1/2lb brisket and a cup of green chile stew. Brisket was tender full of flavor and delicious. The stew was delicious and would definitely have it again. The portions are big and it comes with 4 slices of white bread. So it was very filling and did I mention you can sample an item before buying it?  

This place is organized with a table full of condiments, large bench tables for plenty of seating and a little store inside. They've also got a huge sink to clean up after your meal. If you're an ice tea or lemonade person, they sell it by the gallon to take home. Awesome!

If you're a barbecue person or not, give Rudys barbecue a try. You'll be glad you did. Get there early though to beat the dinner rush and avoid the long lines. Oh yea, be sure to pick yourself up some rice crispy treats from there. They're so good. They say they go fast and after trying one, I bought 3 more."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting family in AZ, and we went for lunch and it was AMAZING !! They gave us some testers and we just didn't know what to choose everything was delicious. Their whole setup is great and they have a variety of drinks to choose from. I love the fact that they had buckets to put your drinks in. Wish there was a Rudys in Los Angeles!! Incredible food the service was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night...got here about 4:30ish, which was perfect timing because by the time we left the line was out the door and towards the parking lot.  

First time visitors and we read the comments posted on Yelp so had a bit of an expectation going in.  You stand in line, check out the menu, grap bottled drinks, get your salad sides and desserts out of the cooler and then up to register to order.  We were offered a tasting of lean brisket and turkey...which were great.  My partner had decided on the brisket in line and quickly changed to the turkey.  It was fabulous!  I had the baby back ribs.  They were meaty and yummy.  Yes...no sauce, which is exactly how we like them because then you control the amount of sauce you want on them!  We also had the cole slaw (it needs more dressing, guys...a bit dry), the 3 bean salad (a bit sweeter but we both really liked it) and we had to try the smoked baked potatoe (butter, sour cream, and cheese)...dang it was big (like a small football) and yummy.  You can definitely taste the smoke on the skin.  

You sit at community tables, which was fine by us!  We love to meet and chat with new people...we sat out on the porch, which was great! 

The condiment bar was clean and nicely stocked.  Previous reviewers mention that you eat on paper, use plastic, etc....we think that's what brings the uniqueness to Rudy's.  We had no issue!

We both had ice tea; my partner loved the sweet tea!  I had regular, which was good.  There are two bbq sauces to use...I'm a whimp so I found the whimpy sauce good, a bit peppery, but I liked it.  Certainly not the best I've ever had but then everyone has their favorite sauce!  My partner tried the hotter one and ended up using the whimpy one as well.

We had the banana pudding for dessert...my partner loved it and I thought it was ok...not a big fan of soggy nilla wafers!

Service was attentive, the place is clean, and we love the big handwashing sink to clean up after eating!  All in all...a great experience and yes! We'll be back to try the \"famous\" breakfast tacos\"!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, brooke was sweet, tge guy and girl that gave me samples and did tge cash register were awesome to me and everyone else. Awesome bbq!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't written a review for Rudy's yet! I was introduces to Rudy's about a year ago and I have to be honest though I have only had them for breakfast,  but Oooo weee are they delish!

They have the best breakfast tacos in town! You can choose different meats, brisket, bacon, sausage, they also have potatoes & eggs too,

My go to the brisket, egg & cheese breakfast taco, so damn good! Hit it with some of the Rudy's bbq sauce and that's one great tasting breakfast!  And it's just $1.50 per taco!! WHAT??? That's the best deal in town!

I always say I am going to try Rudy's during the day, maybe I'll try it for lunch today haha."}
{"text":"My friends and family would always talk up this place so I was pretty darn excites to begin with.

The food is bloody amazing. As a Brit in America it really is nice to be shown how BBQ is really done. The moist brisket is ridiculously nice but it is also brilliant that you get the lean option on the menu. I can come here if my friends go and don't feel bad for eating the lean brisket.

My problem when I come here is that I don't have a big enough stomach for all the things I want to eat. The potato salad is gorgeous and the hot sausage is my absolute favourite. I feel that if I ate here more often that I would have some serious health issues as when I leave my stomach is like a beach ball and I come out around 15 lbs heavier than when I went in. This is certainly not a complaint... more of a testament to my complete lack of self control.

This place is always recommended... but for me just when I am extremely hungry."}
{"text":"Went here last night after a long bike ride with the bf.  Decided to grab Rudy's.  Originally from OK and travel to TX quite often, Rudy's is quite popular in the SW.  I ordered the brisket sandwich and he ordered the pulled pork along with Rudy's beans.  The meat wasn't as tender.  We did use the BBQ sauce for flavoring which helped. The beans were okay.  I think the beans from Little Miss BBQ is on point.  Service was great though.  It's a decent place if you are trying to find something that opens later on a weekday evening."}
{"text":"I have had Rudy's in NM, it was so good!  Pre-Yelp days.  I was excited to hear that they are in AZ.  

The lines at 5:30pm were already 1 hour+ long.  After you wait and wait, you need to find a spot to sit with all your goodies.  Got the 1/2 lbs of brisket (moist), a little dry but the table side BBQ sauce fixed that up.  The 1/2 lbs of baby back ribs = 5 ribs was dry and the BBQ sauce could not save that one.  The small order of new potatoes was really really small (about 10 small chucks) & tasteless and the corn on the cob was great.  The sweet  tea is out of this world.  And they forgot to give me bread."}
{"text":"I had Rudy's in New Mexico and it was so good.  Then they opened one up in Chandler, and I was excited!  I was super excited that a Rudy's was opening on the West side. No more driving 40 mins to get BBQ.  Like always, I love the moist brisket and the baby back ribs.  The corn on the cob was so sweet and good.  I like the Sissy BBQ sauce.  Yes, I am a wimp."}
{"text":"9/01/12
I died and went to heaven where all the good pigs and all the good cows go. God then decided let's have a good BBQ with all these good animals... ahaha!  But really, that is how the story goes of how this place got started, haha! J/K! But could be ;)

I fell in love with this place, very casual, hands on and yummylicious! As i walked in it was love at first smell, I have already decided that I'll be taking my next road trip to AZ just to come and eat at Rudy's... just have to wait for a nice long weekend to come by.

This place is great, they make you feel welcomed and at ease as soon as you come in. By the looks of it, if you've never been there you would get a bit nervous at the way you have to order and just from having to figure it out. But no problem, someone greeted us at the door and explained the entire process and then it was all nice and easy. It sort of felt like I was standing in the lunch line at my old elementary cafeteria, except here you have the option of picking up a metal bucket and filling it with a variety of beers (that would of bee something in school! haha!) or bottled drinks but you can also go with regular fountain drinks if you prefer. 

In the seating area there are these long picnic-like tables and TV's around. You use tear out paper instead of plates and you don't need utensils but they have them if you must. 

Now lets get down to business; The meat is great, delicious tasting without even any BBQ sauce added. You get to sample as many different types as you like (except with bone) before you buy and they sell it by the pound (lb.) or in sandwiches. Let me tell yall, we tried it all! And it was all great, so good that we couldn't decide on what to get. The turkey was so moist and juicy. The sausage was yummy and spicy. The pulled pork, the beef, the ribs, the brisket...aaah I can go on. It was all yummy! Then you get to add the sauce and its something else from there; spicy, sweet, regular.

I can't go on because I'm going to start drooling just from thinking about it.
I will end with this, its a must try if your ever in AZ. Road trip anyone!?
Fingerlicking yummyliciousness! Enjoy!

P.S. Oh yeah, they also have a variety of sides (cole slaw, potato salad, corn etc.) and chicken ( and if you must know I don't care for any chicken, but I'm sure thats good too)."}
{"text":"Just love this place! Yu can order just the right amount of food you want. When you go up to counter, you tell them what you want & seat yourself. They give you all the fixings you want. The sliced brisket is our favorite. You can order fattier or lean. Both are great. If you dont want to pick off fat, get lean. Its still very little fat on it. The fat is what makes the meat jucier. We order a few slices of bread with it to make brisket sandwiches. The ribs are very good too. We also get the green chile gumbo. It is spicy, but very good!"}
{"text":"Awesome barbecue! This place is very crowed during peak hours and the atmosphere is Texas styling with personality and flare. It's kinda far from my area but it was worth the long trip. Hope they open more in Arizona like northern area's. I suggest trying a little of everything."}
{"text":"If you love bbq this is a must try. Love the Turkey! Side dishes are great! Grab a beer and enjoy some good food and service!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Drove thru from tucson and was very dissatisfied. Mostly from the brisket.  Looked and tasted like roast beef. Terrible. This place can be really food but has taken on the chain restaurant feel. Goes to show no one in AZ can do good BBQ."}
{"text":"not even close to the flavor of rudys in austin,tx. ribs were tough,brisket was bland and way  overcooked. dropped 80 bucks at this location about a month and a half after they opened and will not be returning. i will wait till i visit the inlaws in texas to pick up some rudys bbq."}
{"text":"Best bbq in town!  I stop every time I pass thru.   Brisket has real smoke flavor.  Green chill stew is to die for."}
{"text":"Love the buy it by the poun, on Butcher paper real Texas bbq.  I won't can't drive by without stopping in for cutters choice briket."}
{"text":"I don't know how to rate this place.  I'm not sure if I ate at a fast food place or a casual dining restaurant.  

We arrived at 5:45 on a Saturday and stood in line outside until we made our way up to the order window.  The menu is fairly simple yet knowing when to grab your food is a bit complicated.  When you are waiting in line you are tempted with bottles of Mexico sourced Coke and several beer options.  I'm not sure if we're supposed to start drinking in line or suffer with cold wet hands.  Closer to the front of the line is a refrigeration unit stocked with potato salad, cole slaw, and a variety of dessert choices.  After watching people go back and forth from the order window to the line to get their side dishes I opted to grab and go before heading to the order window. 

My son and I opted for 1/2 pound of baby back ribs, daughter selected the briscitt sandwich, and the old lady ordered chicken.  We ordered a pint of potato salad, a cup of cole slaw, and a cup of banana pudding.  All of the food was piled on a cafeteria style tray. 

We sat down at a long cafeteria style table next to some friendly folks.  We spread out our food on some butcher paper - I guess we don't get plates.  This seemed to work fine for ribs but did have to chase around the potato salad a little bit.  

All of the food was good, not great.  Had a heck time getting Rudy's BBQ sauce out of the bottles on the tables.  Had to beat them like a catsup bottle.  Felt a little sorry for the elderly gentleman next to me.  I ended helping him as had taken his pocket knife out of his pocket to do God knows what to the bottle. 

This is the first time I liked the food but didn't like the eating experience.

Since we live in N Glendale there's a pretty good chance we won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of meat but the breakfast tacos with jalapeno sausage were really good!!!  I went back within a couple of days....that says a lot for a person who doesn't eat meat but a couple times a month. Keep it up.. maybe my husband will turn me into a full time meat eater taking me to this place."}
{"text":"Okay...so I lived in Austin from 2000-2007 and had unlimited access to Rudy's. Loved their brisket and sauce, gas station set up and the fact they market themselves as the \"worst BBQ\". I moved to Phx for 4 years then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio this time and yes we have Rudy's but they're not nearly as accessible as they are in ATX. So I think Ive been once in 2 years. Went for a wkd trip to Phx at the end of July and low and behold what do e drive by in Chandler? A Rudy's! My friend had never been so I insisted we go there for breakfast. Unfortunately my friend wasn't a fan of the sauce.. too peppery for her liking. I loved every second..not so much the brisket/egg taco but the potato egg & cheese with the sauce. OMFG! Delish! Well now Im moving back to CT so Im sure Rudy's is in my pat but Im glad I got one last taste. Ill miss you."}
{"text":"Great concept, however the food seemed to be lacking for me. 

The decor was pretty awesome.  A huge open space filled with picnic tables and butcher paper for you to eat your meal on - great for families and large groups. You walk by troughs full of sodas when you line up and choose your sides and dessert as you pass the fridges. The family I went with ordered an assortment of meats and sides. Everything looked delicious, except for the fact that all of the meats were just a bit too salty for me....which was a shame. The ribs were probably my favorite between the brisket and pulled pork."}
{"text":"Solid Texas style BBQ and Shiner Beers. Nothing better."}
{"text":"There is NOTHING here you can go wrong with!

My personal favorites:
Cutter's Choice Brisket
Jalape√±o Sausage
Beans
Sweet Tea

The best!

Us Texans know!  Rudy's is the bomb!

The things are wives do for us!

The \"Sause\" has outstanding bite!

Opening day!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, do-it-yourself service, always leave satisfied and overly full. I've probably had better brisket, but am no expert, the turkey sandwich is top notch, buttered buns is a nice touch. A surprisingly good craft beer selection in ice buckets you snake past as you wait in line (Goose Island, San Tan, 4 Peaks etc). Service is bizarrely great-you only deal with employees at the counter, but they're extremely helpful and pleasant. Extra slices of bread, napkins, every condiment you can imagine are on the central table, and love the slop sink outside the bathroom so you can wash up & rinse BBQ sauce off as many times as you want without venturing into the loo. Rudy's BBQ sauce is the kicker, a little more spice than smoke, in my spice-loving opinion a great complement to the food & a nice souvenir to take home (Sissy sauce available for sissies). The typical BBQ cabin atmosphere, even a little more folksy than most BBQ places, but that adds to the no-nonsense charm. Will be back once my appetite recovers from this visit."}
{"text":"HOLY AMAZING BBQ!
This is the kind of place that makes me think, \"Thank God I'm not a vegetarian!\"
The smoked meats are terrific, namely the Brisket (moist) and the Turkey (who knew BBQ could be guiltless?! And SO delicious--only about 200 calories for a half pound), which is so juicy and flavorful it doesn't need sauce.
My husband and I did Take-Out so we didn't have to deal with the lines and that went very smoothly...so friendly and helpful was the counter girl that he asked if he could tip her--she said \"not allowed\" (which was cool).
We tried a little bit of everything on the side: potato salad was egg/vinegar style (no bacon or onions) and we both enjoyed it. The cream corn was rich and tasty but a bit too sweet for me (wasn't expecting that; almost thought it could be a dessert). The BEST side we tried was the Green Chile Stew which had a kick but not too much. Very nice!
For dessert I was just going to taste the Peach Cobbler (I gobbled it all up!) and the banana pudding (with Nilla Wafers and whipped cream, nice but could've used some real banana chunks). 
I'm from Jersey so my opinion on Texas BBQ carries very little (if any) weight but I can say that the smoked meats are wonderful and they allow you to put your own sauce on (\"Original\" or \"Sissy\") which I like because sometimes I don't want ANY sauce.
I am already planning my next visit! Yay!"}
{"text":"Wow excellent smoked meat with great flavor. A must visit if you are close. Nice place to eat and very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is T.H.E. best BBQ in Chandler area. The rib and jalapenos sausages are my favorite. Cream corn is super yummy."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try their breakfast taco ( aka burrito) ever since this BBQ joint opened its doors.  There are two ways to order, either go to the front register area and purchase a pre made taco, or go to the main ordering area and customize your taco.  If you are in a rush, definitely go with the pre-made tacos.  They taste fine and are warm.  If you have few minutes to kill, then order your custom taco and walk around, explore the \"interesting\" Texas/Nascar/gas station decor.  I ordered the brisket with potatoes, cheese, and eggs.  It comes with a flour tortilla.  I found that one did not fill me up so I ordered another.  The piece de resistance, the meat, was tender and moist, just as expected.  It did have a gas type of oder which I was not digging.   Now I need to go back and explore more of my normally suppressed carnivore urges and try the lunch and dinner offerings."}
{"text":"Great brisket, they could use a few more sides. But the brisket is the best in Phoenix I have had so far. The smoked turkey is good too. The regular bbq sauce is good & has a nice kick. If you look spicy & green chiles you've gotta try the green chile stew its a meal in itself"}
{"text":"This place has been the talk of the town since it opened! Finally arrive to check it out with my son for lunch. I had the baby back ribs. They are served on a plastic tray from coco-cola on paper. I picked the first one up and bit into what I think is beef jerky. The amoke flavor is way to strong for me. The other pieces were like eating rubber. When you bit into it, it was like the snap you get from a braut then chew chew chew. 
My son had the pulled pork. He enjoyed it and said the meat was tender and moist. 
I may give it one more try with the wife since she has been wanting to come here."}
{"text":"Rudy's is great for both breakfast and lunch.  They serve breakfast tacos until 10am everyday, but if you come after that, there will still be some left on the heater.  I love their sides, but their potato salad is some of the best ever.  They also have great banana and chocolate pudding that you can take to go if you fill up on too much BBQ.  The customer service is great, and they will let you sample meats if it's your first time.  They have paper towel rolls at all the tables, but they also have a sink in the dining room to wash your hands in.  I feel like I'm back in Texas when I eat at Rudy's."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here. I've driven past it many times. My sister flew in and stupid let's try it. We ordered the ribs. I grabbed myself a Bud light and loved it.

You check in the front and are told to grab your drink from a large container. You have your selections of various drinks, sodas and beers. then you go to the counter where all the cooking and serving is done. You order your selection of meat and how much you want (weight). it's cut and placed on and plate and I to and plastic basket where everything else goes (in Ludington drinks). You then order your sides, pay, and go to the condiments table. This is where you get your knives, spoons, etc. 

Don't forget to tear off some paper from. the roll as your dinner mat. Sit down, eag, and clean up after yourself. 

Overall, I liked it. Will definitely come back here again for lunch. don't know how crazy it gets during dinner."}
{"text":"All of the BBQ choices are fantastic. We normally order the beef brisket (tender), and pork St Louis ribs. The portions are sold by weight. Tad pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"For BBQ, this place is excellent.  T had been talking a lot of hype, so we went with my aunt when we were visiting Phoenix.  Her words verbatim:  \"This is my kind of restaurant.\"

We got brisket, jalape√±o sausage, pulled pork, ribs, cole slaw, corn on the cob, potatoes, and some bread.  A bucket of beer and we were set to go!  Everything was delicious, and it was a fun place to eat with communal picnic tables and self service everything.  Their sauces had great spice, or you could get sissy sauce if you wanted less heat.  I wish they had wet wipes though, it would have made the experience much less messy considering the amount of ribs we had."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've had (other than my trip to Texas). I love the Cutter's Choice and Moist Brisket. The loaded potato with chopped meat is killer (on your diet as well if you're on one).

All the staff is friendly and attentive. Overall great BBQ if you're looking for it, just make sure you're not counting calories when you come to this place, it'll absolutely destroy your diet haha."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Rudy's   Makes me feel sorry for the BBQ place across the street from it.   They cannot come close to the quality and prices.   Will be back in Oct on my way east."}
{"text":"Rudy's is awesome.  We've been several times in San Antonio and loved it, so I was excited to try out the new Arizona location.  Tastes just like the Texas BBQ I remembered!  Smoked turkey is always my favorite, and Rudy's doesn't disappoint, great flavor and juicy.  It was especially good on their smoked baked potato.  Rudy's \"Sause\" is awesome, sweet and spicy with lots of black pepper, honestly my favorite barbecue sauce of all that I've tried, and that's lots!  Good thing they sell their sauce bottled, I had to pick up a few to take on the flight back home!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed.  I had the brisket and it was very, very tough.  It had a good taste but you couldn't chew it and I wasn't going to swallow it whole.  Not impressed.  Maybe other parts of the country have better quality meats, but this place was awful."}
{"text":"Real wood, real smoke, real BBQ. Ok, so this place is not a small hole in the wall  independent operator kinda place. It's big just like everything in Texas. It's also pretty darn good. I'm a sucker for their brisket. Excellent crust, beautiful smoke ring and full smokey beef flavor. Don't forget the sides. Their slaw is ok and the potato salad is better than most other Q joints. Grab a cold beer and pull up a seat at a picnic table and enjoy. I'll see you there."}
{"text":"I tend to avoid chain BBQ. Nothing is less authentic than a cookie cutter chain. But Rudy's... they do a fine good job of making you forget that you are actually at a chain location. The moist brisket is insanely good! The true to Texas style cafeteria pay by the pound lay out, reminds you, you might be at a chain, but you are at the best darn chain in Texas."}

{"text":"So I like meat (har-har). I wouldn't call myself a bbq connoisseur but I do enjoy good ribs when I get the chance to. When a friend dragged my beau and myself here last night, I was a bit skeptical but the minute I walked in, I couldn't help but salivate at the smell of all the barbeque. 

They offered us a sample when we got to the register of the brisket and turkey. Both were mighty tasty. The brisket was fantastic. I got the cutter's choice, but next time I think I'd go with the moist. My beau got the ribs which were pretty fantastic too. We dosed our meals in their bbq \"sause\" and it was amazing, really tasty with a spicy kick at the end. I also recommend getting their potato salad, so good.

Don't forget to ask for your military discount while you're there! 

Easy to say, I'll be back (for meat)."}
{"text":"Was expecting some what more of a sit down service atmosphere. Everything was self serve. No kid friendly menu. Ribs were not fall of the bone type. Service at the counter was awful, the cashier just tossed our food in the box and one of our corn almost fell on the floor. Too over priced. Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"This review is regarding customer service:

I was planning on having them cater a family gathering, they were really great about follow up, super easy to communicate with, and very polite even after we decided to not have them cater(only because we decided not to have ANYONE cater- the guest of honor requested a different type of cuisine)."}
{"text":"Depends what you get. I personally think it is overpriced. The Stew is 5 stars! The Brisket is 5 Stars. Everything else is \"meh\" for me."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have some yummy BBQ is you are in the west valley. Service was superb! They let you sample items before buying them. The atmosphere is fun and casual, picnic style. You're in for a treat because it's a messy good time. I loved every minute of it. I was so full I thought I was gonna pop!! Hahah! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Not a good place!  I got the 6 dollar brisket which ended up being 12.99!  Tons of fat and the inside wasn't nice. Kids running around with bbq sauce hands and sauce bottles on the table too big to hold.  Don't go here, go across the street to Can't Stop Smoking- they had great prices, great food and great employees."}
{"text":"What in the world happened? The last two timed I tried this place it was awful. I seriously think they don't actually smoke the turkey or pork loin anymore.   It's just awful, awful, chewy, fatty, barely cooked meat now.  The bread has also been rock hard stale as well.  The brisket is still great, the rest is awful."}
{"text":"If your looking for great barbecue wins kick Rudy's is here it's at.  This is such an amazing place every time I go, but today I received EXCEPTIONAL service from Julian at the cash register.  I wanted to take a moment to shout him out and give Rudy's an overall 5 stars."}
{"text":"A little overwhelming if it's your first time going. Loved the ribs, but the other meats were only okay. By the time we had finished our meat, the creamed corn was still too hot to eat. I wish they had real utensils and containers instead of plastic and styrofoam."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. If I wanted a cafeteria I'd get a school lunch. Golden coral better food and price."}
{"text":"The service was awesome, the atmosphere was great, but it was a bit pricey plus they don't have french fries which was a bummer. Maybe I'm just too used to Famous Dave's but it's a cool place and you should check it out, -the food is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Love this place, you can get your food right after you order! First time here, the kind staff offered us two slices of turkey n brisket to free for free. N they taste wonderful!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite rudys I have been to this one and the one in Albuquerque and my husband has been to the one in san Antonio also and this is also his favorite one.
We can't drive past this place even when were not hungry we find our self pulling in and grabbing food whenever were driving thru the area, thank goodness we live in Tucson or we would be spending all our money here ;)
Yes it is that good!!!! They also do military discount which is a great bonus and we love to support those companies that support us.
Don't drive by go here you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Amazing just like it is in Texas!!! If you want the real deal come here! Ribs are my fav!"}
{"text":"I tried Rudy's about a month ago with my boyfriend and my roommates. Now, I am not a huge BBQ fan, it's just never been my favorite, however, Rudy's was pretty delicious. 

The menu is simply placed on the wall with quite a few options, but not too many to make your decision impossible. You're able to try a sample before you order it if you would like as well. 

The pulled-pork sandwich I ordered was cooked to perfection and paired with some really buttery and delicious mashed potatoes ( btw, I am a mashed potato fiend). 

The staff is friendly and upbeat and their service is quite speedy. 

Rudy's would be  a five star for me if it weren't for the picnic benches. I am all for theming your restaurant, however picnic benches are, and always will be, my idea of a bad time. They aren't comfortable and it's also weird because they're connected, like in a cafeteria. If I wanted to sit next to random people, I would go to a sushi bar or something of the sort. I just wanted to sit with my friends and enjoy my meal without the person next to me honing in on my conversations. 

All together, though, I do think I will return to Rudy's for some fine pulled-pork."}
{"text":"My husband raved about this place for quite awhile so I guess when I finally got around to trying it I was a little disappointed. The hype was built too high and for too long. I love the ambience but the food was just ok to me. The sausage was my favorite but the brisket was just ok."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night some family. Had the Moist Brisket, spicy sausage, regular sausage, baby back ribs, corn, cole slaw and potato salad. 

Great food and service. The restaurant is always clean and staff is always friendly. This is a better deal then most of the other BBQ places in the valley. 

Glad we came."}
{"text":"We've been there a few time and really enjoy most of the barbecue.  They have the option of moist brisket and we love that.  Chopped beef, pulled pork, sausages, and baby backs all were really good.  Skip the prime rib and turkey, both were smokey but dry.  Sides are also good.  Our favorite is the green chili stew.  It's a great place for kids."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences ever! If you're not familiar with the layout of the place and how it works just be prepared for a long waiting in line for line style food service and no plates to eat off of. The food was not very good. Famous Daves is far better. People were nice. Open seating, but be prepared to sit next to strangers on tables that are way too close together. No waiters so you're bussing your own table. On the upside you won't have to tip anyone which is great because you don't feel very happy when u leave and it wouldn't be fair to blame an innocent server."}
{"text":"Very nice staff.  We were excited finally make it to Rudy's , but very disappointed.  The brisket was very disappointing. The pork loin was good."}
{"text":"I Love this place. This is my favorite place to come and eat with my Family or even when I am in town just shopping I have to stop and grab something. This year we will be ordering our Turkey from here. So far everything I have tried is amazing. And if I want to try something new I can always ask for a sample. And the staff is great!"}
{"text":"This is a staple when I am in the PHX area. Highly recommend. You really can't go wrong with any thing that you order"}
{"text":"I tried this place several years ago and didn't think much of it. I tried it again the other night and it was EXCELLENT some of the best BBQ in the valley. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"In the area for a soccer tournament. This place was within walking distance. Read about the breakfast burritos and decided to take a walk and gamble $2.00. Decided to try the Breakfast burritos/tacos.... Pretty good for $1.95each, salsa for them was pretty bland tasting-no heat."}
{"text":"Good BBQ.  However, the side dishes are a bit pricey considering they offer very generic coleslaw and potato salad.  It's good but not something we crave."}
{"text":"Amazing meal!!  Four baby back ribs ...pulled pork sandwich...small beans...small potato salad. Awesome meal. Very casual but I loved every bite. You are to go if you are in the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"I met up with my friends in Chandler to eat some BBQ. We got here at a little after 6 pm. As to be expected, the line was long. After waiting in line, we ordered a bunch of meats including pork ribs, brisket, sausage, creamed corn, potato salad, and a gallon of tea. I stuck with their sissy sauce as I had a marathon to run the next day and didn't want to risk any GI issues during the race. You can eat the meat with bread and pickles. My friends told me that their brisket was good and I can confirm that that was their best item. It was so good that we got back in line to order some more. The rest of the food was pretty decent.

The seating here is picnic style. After ordering your food, you'll need to find a place to sit down. Then grab some paper and napkins before you start eating. Afterwards you bus your own table."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to to get BBQ. I only have 4 stars because I did bite on a bone when I got my pulled pork sandwich back in March. Inhavent had any issues since. Dinning in is a great experience and my son loves this place too. Brisket or pulled pork sandwiches are my go to meal with potatoes salad. The sauce is very nice the have regular and sissy. The regular has some heat but not too bad while the sissy is mellow bbq sauce.

I'd you are in the area for breakfast, stop in and get the breakfast tacos. You can select from different options and there is nothing better than a little bbq with your eggs."}
{"text":"Very expensive. Stick to the brisket, sausage, corn on the cob, and potato salad. Avoid the pulled pork, the baby back ribs were a joke. Only BBQ place near here so I guess they have me as a customer by proxy."}
{"text":"I am pretty picky and I really like BBQ....that said I do not generally like standing in line to order but we pushed on!  The ribs were just OK, the moist brisket was outstanding, the green chili stew was also outstanding!  I tried my wife's pulled pork and it was again, just OK.  Very good service, place is clean, prices are very reasonable.  Oh...tried a few of the breakfast burritos the other morning to go...delicious!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Me encanta ir a los lugares donde venden brisket, pero en esta ocasi√≥n me lleve  una mala experiencia, ya que estaba pasado de cocimiento."}
{"text":"Nice place. Outstanding foods. 4 because I had better BBQ in the past.  Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time here and it was great! The food was delicious, nicely presented, and one of a kind. They gave us samples to try different types of meat since it was our first time, which was very nice. The turkey was moist with awesome flavor, the brisket was good, and the pulled pork was also very good. Great customer service and the restaurant was very clean. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"good for a quick bbq fix for the west valley, we needed another joint here!

first time in i tried the brisket sandwich, $5 and almost 1/3 of a pound of brisket and two buns. they gave me some extra slices to try of the moist brisket and it was on point.

today i came back in and ordered a pound of ribs, brisket, and jalapeno sausage; with a side of potato salad and a coke, this meal was good but I NEEDED more. all that cost about $50.

service is good, everyone is smiling and shouting the order out for quick servings. they weigh out the meat in front of you so it's legit.

if their prices for each meat would have been a dollar or two less, this place would be bomb! 

the sauces are good, but kind of monotonous. overall: smiling service, cute decor, decent bbq."}
{"text":"When you first walk in it's definitely a cool atmosphere! They have tons of vintage coke bottles and different sodas, and cute buckets you can fill with beer or other drinks. If it's your first time they also give you a bunch of samples at the counter! definitely a fun experience. I just have this place 3 stars though because of the average quality of the food. The meat was dry and nothing I ate stood out. Definitely like Dillon's as a BBQ restaurant more than Rudy's. The service was awesome, but food average. You can also only choose from two sauces that are at your table."}
{"text":"Great spot to pick up fresh meat for grilling and feeding the whole family. I like this place more than supermarkets because they season everything. It's more like a butcher shop, with a cafeteria."}
{"text":"As close to home as it gets (Texas). I eat in sometimes for the atmosphere, but we mostly pick it up and take it home."}
{"text":"Was invited to eat here with a couple of friends today for lunch.  Parking lot was full (always a good sign).  I'm not a big BBQ eater and wont go somewhere like this of my own accord, but glad my friends chose this place, otherwise would have never of known what I was missing.  It smells amazing just walking in.  I ordered the sausage sandwich.  It was awesome.  Over stuffed with sausage, just the way I like it.  The brisket My friend ordered looked really moist and definitely what I am going to try the next time.  Yes I said I am going there again.  A drink and sandwich came out to exactly $7.00.  And it was filling.  If your a bbq fan, you'll love this place.  If your not a big bbq fan, like me, you will be surprised at how good it is."}
{"text":"Recommend by my cousin who is a native of AZ. I must say this is by far the BEST!!! BBQ I had in a while!! I came in on a Saturday around 6-7pm. It was really busy, most of the employees had never seen it that busy. Either way all food is sold at half a pound. If it's your first time there they give you samples so make sure to speak up!! I ordered a brisket sandwich, jumbo baked potato, and half pound of chicken. My sister ordered the prime rib, jumbo baked potato, and a corn on the cob. All I have to say is OMG!!!!! Pricing for what we got was $42 but it was well worth it!! They give you so much food it was amazing!!! Everything from the brisket to the chicken to the potato was amazing. The brisket was soft and flavorful and the chicken was cooked to perfection. Everything according to the employees is cooked fresh and served that same day!! You can definitely tell by the way the food tasted and the tenderness of everything. I would highly recommend this place a 100%!! Also recommend bringing your family if you have a lot of relatives or members because they do serve you a lot of food. You will not be disappointed when you eat here. Also the employees are super friendly and if it's your first time they guide you on what you need to do. Also the service is quick you may wait in line for  2-5 mins but the minute you get to the ordering register you pretty much get served on the spot and then grab your food and find a seat. Must Go!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing BBQ!  Since discovering Rudy's we have forsaken all other wannabe BBQ joints!  Even the kids love it.  The Brisket 'moist' is the best anywhere!  THe nice thng is they don't need to smother their meat in sauce like other places.  They have a great sauce, but the bbq stands on its own.  The sides are awesome as well..........and the best part is you can eat with your hands!  They provide rolls of butcher paper and we love to toss the food on the table and go to town!  My 8tr. old daughter loves the brisket as well and her favorite quote is:  You gotta have the fat 'cause if you cut the fat, you fill the flavor!"}
{"text":"First rule of BBQ, since there's BBQ options everywhere, (across the st.) you better make it great to get me back, you better make it amazing to get me to bring a friend.
After Saturday I will do neither because Rudy's broke the rule. Note to Rudy, COLD BBQ at any price is not very good. 
We ordered the moist brisket, good thing as I would have hated to see the not moist version. Really good brisket but cold and not really moist.
Brisket baked potato, good lord how do you serve a baked potato cold where the butter just sits there and the cheese never has a prayer to melt.  It was terrible to try and mash the cold butter, cold sour cr√®me and cold cheese together when the potato is hard and, yes, cold.
BBQ Chicken, amazing but this was the worst part of the meal. BBQ chicken from a \"BBQ\" place should have a dark char to the skin with some kind of heat or flavor to say BBQ. This thing was 4 pieces of yellow fowl, literally cold to the touch with flavorless skin. 
Yes I could have taken it up and asked them to serve me a hot, maybe warm meal that I just paid a lot of money for. We just picked on a potion of it and threw the rest away. 
So back to the rule. I will not be back and I did tell a friend but it was not what Rudy's was hoping for.          
Note to self, when you walk into a BBQ joint at 12:00 on a Saturday and there's no line, go next door."}
{"text":"First time in the door and WOW were we ever rushed to get through the line. The \"Next, next, next\" got super annoying especially when you consider we were the only ones in line and we asked for a minute to look at the menu board. As for the food, I'd rather go across the street to \"Can't Stop Smokin\" as they have a much larger selection. As for what was offered, I'd rather go to \"Joe's Real BBQ\" for the price to quantity/quality factor. Where all of these 4 & 5 star ratings are coming from is beyond me. They have signs that say \"Your Mother doesn't work here, clean up after yourself!\" I wish my Mom did work there, at least then the tables might actually get cleaned between meals. Guarantee we won't EVER be back!"}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of dining at Rudy's in Tx, Co, NM and now AZ. I have never been disappointed. Great BBQ at great prices."}
{"text":"1st time visiting.  Delish.  Friendly.  Quick.  They let my husband and I sample prior to ordering.  Only downside was  no cornbread or biscuits."}
{"text":"Really solid BBQ!  Not fancy, just lots of good food.  Pulled pork was delicious, moist and tasty!  Lean briquette was not dry, very tasty and really good."}
{"text":"Excellent! The best BBQ I have found in Arizona.  Since I've
Been to Texas there has been no other BBQ I like till now. Great ribs!!! Wonderful service and superb BBQ sauce !  I'm in love!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome services, outstanding brisket and great prices! Authentic Bar-B-Que joint!"}
{"text":"Breakfast tacos...who doesn't love them?! Not only is their food good (moist brisket is out of this world) but their service is amazing! One time the manager noticed we had been waiting long and brought over a rudys cup as an apology...we didn't complain or anything...he had just paid attention!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of set up cafeteria style. Walk in and hop in line. Grab a drink from one of the large ice coolers or get a cup for fountain drinks at the register. Crab a cold item from the refrigerator and then order at the counter. They were super nice when we said we were newbies! We were given three or four types of meat to sample. Brisket is great! I ended of with the spicy chop. Bf ordered pulled pork. His usual. 

Spicy chop is delicious! It's already sauced up and obviously a little spicy! Get it on a bun or eat it by itself. Either way, it's amazing. Throw some of their yummy pickles on top (from the toppings bar) and your set! 
Most amazing potato salad I have had! Sadly the beans were not my favorite. I LOVE BBQ style country baked beans. These were lacking flavor....I think? I just recall not liking them. Cole slaw was just fine. Not amazing. Just fine."}
{"text":"Look there are a lot of chain BBQ joints. Their BBQ is on par with the original in Texas. When you get to order it by the weight, you can get your fav's and order a little bit of this or that. It a great way for picky  children to get what they want and keep those napkins coming as it is finger licking good!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food for the quality and amount that you receive compared to other bbq places in the valley. Plus there is no competition in the west valley for bbq so it seems like they don't need to put very much effort in service and food."}
{"text":"Everytime we drive in from Tucson, we stop here! It's so good! Large portions! The sides are all tasty! We've never had a bad experience coming to Rudy's. Plus it's nice to get a cute little BlueBell ice cream in our way out for dessert. Did I mention how tasty their bbq sauce is?... It's so yummy!!!
Oh ya, and I love the large clean up sink for after!"}
{"text":"If you happen to be in PHX and can't get TX BBQ then this is the place. I've tried everything they offer and have never been disappointed. I just wish it was easier to get the sauce out of there bottles."}
{"text":"We were so happy to find a Rudy's in AZ!  My parents live in Texas, and I thought I'd only ever get my Rudy's fix when I make it all the way out there. This one sits right on our path from San Diego up to the AZ mountains, and it makes for a great lunch stop for our annual trip. 

Turkey is always moist and delicious! My husband prefers the brisket, and he's been happy with both the regular brisket sandwich and the spicy chopped brisket sandwich. 

Sauce is amazing - we keep his and hers bottles in our fridge at all times (I'm the Sissy, he's the regular). 

Creamed corn. Just stop by for that alone. Pro tip - add some of the sauce to it. This is one of those things that I crave and can't ever quite replicate at home. 

This last trip, we got several pounds of meat, creamed corn, and coleslaw to take home to San Diego. Looking forward to a few amazing lunches and dinners back home!"}
{"text":"Loved the spicy chopped brisket!  The Mac salad was good and the banana pudding is amazing. The vibe is cool and welcoming. The concept is genius, take a backyard BBQ and out it in an enclosed setting. Well done Rudy!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Rudy's today and everything was delicious. Our party had the pulled pork, brisket, baby back ribs, spicy chop and the green chili stew and everyone loved their selections. We had two little ones with us (3 and 1) and they could be loud and they didn't stand out. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. And they offer a  military discount. Fantastic customer service, country fair-esque atmosphere"}
{"text":"I always get cutter's choice beef brisket. Delicious! I love their bbq sauce as well."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had? No...but holy cow, is it darn close. The brisket was awesomely tender and moist while the pulled pork was also full of smokey flavor. I wish I had the chance to try the ribs, but my friend and I could only eat so much. We also split a pint of the green chili stew...now THAT was a memorable winner. Super good...I even converted my half of the pulled pork sandwich into a sloppy joe-esque sandwich by piling the stew inside. That was heaven on earth especially after a 13 hour roadtrip!

The original sauce is more spicy and the sissy sauce is more sweet. Stick with the original. Rudy's also has this cool trough like storage of their bottled sodas. Grab a bucket and some ice and stick your drinks right in - pretty novel idea."}
{"text":"We like to take guests from out of town for a treat here. So far all the guests and us have been liking our food here. I like the look and atmosphere of the restaurant too. Will come back again and again."}
{"text":"One of the better BBQ joints I've found in Phoenix so far--notably better than Joe's Real BBQ, which I'm a big fan of.  All of their meats are quality cuts smoked nicely.  I can't stop ordering the spicy chop!"}
{"text":"Rudy's is one of the most conflicting BBQ joints I have experienced. The food is not bad, but comparing the food to bigger joints such as Bobby-Q's and Lucille's, it really falls short on the BBQ deliciousness scale.  However, given the atmosphere, speed, and level of service, Rudy's is top notch.  If you're hunkering for some good BBQ, but don't want to sit in a restaurant waiting and waiting, Rudy's is a strong option to consider.  It also helps that it's one of the best BBQ joints in the south-west valley."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly & helpful staff. Brisket was tender....not much smoke flavor and not a fan of the pepper rub or the sauce or beans. Tea was great."}
{"text":"Food was great. They know how to bar-be-que!!! The environment was very western style which was very nice. If u r expecting high quality meat or great service, do not go here. This is very casual and fast-food type place which is perfect for lunch. The price was bit pricey but good meat. Overall, it was very good."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here.  This was my first time at a Rudy's.  I have one near home but thought I would give the one in Chandler, AZ a try since I'm here on business.  The girl who greeted me at the door was very sweet and helpful when i told her it was a first visit.  The counter staff was a tiny bit dismissive but what I'm used to with younger workers.  I got the lean brisket and turkey.  Both had wonderful flavor (but no after issues :).  The potato salad was not as good as mine - but it's good and the corn on the cob was fabulous.  But why is butter an option? It's not corn on the cob without butter!!  Excellent tea.  It was early so not much of a crowd which was fine with me.  It will be on my list next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Haven't found too many butcher style BBQ places here and was skeptical, (which i normally am now of any bbq place after having little miss), but this place didn't disappoint. 

Allowing you to sample anything on the menu before ordering was huge plus. I had the prime rib along with a non spicy sausage and some shredded brisket. All was pretty good most definitely better than any Lucille's or Famous Dave's etc. This is good BBQ!"}
{"text":"What an awesome surprise in Chandler!  My husband and I stopped in for Dinner last night and let me tell you how refreshing this place was.  No plates, not your typical Az BBQ restaurant.  LOVED the entire experience.  And that's what it was!  Great brisket, great turkey, coleslaw and Rudy's beans!!  Man the White Mountains needs a Rudy's!  We have so few restaurants that I even want to eat at twice.  This place was incredible, from the decor, the ordering experience where smoked and Bbq'd meat is sold by the (1/2) pound, to the \"no plate\" atmosphere, to the wash basin in the hallway where you can wash up...I totally enjoyed my Rudy's experience and have told 3 people about it and it hasn't even been 24 hours since I ate there!  A must try in Chandler.  Feel sorry for the \"other\" place next door.  No competition....Try Rudy's...you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"On my monthly trip around the state of Arizona I tend to stay in Goodyear once a month.  I keep finding my way back to Rudy's.  They don't advertise gluten free but do have a lot of choices for any allergies.  Ask at the front desk they have a laminated allergy menu,  including dairy,  soy,  gluten and sulfites too.  Food is great.   I have tried the ribs,  sausages,  brisket,  potato salad and the cole slaw.  They have real food and always fill me up.  I have never been disappointed here.   I love the Chandler location too.   Will happily return."}
{"text":"This place is good.  The meat is a little too smokey for my liking, still delicious though. The regular sauce is pretty spicy. I had to go with the wussy sauce. (which you put your own on at the table) Moist brisket is the way to go. The ribs are good too. Cream corn and the peach cobbler aren't too shabby either.  Very authentic."}
{"text":"Drove here from Cali since Texas is too far... Totally worth it... I want to swim in their creamed corn."}
{"text":"I'm a true meat and potatoes kinda gal so when a new BBQ place opens up of course I gotta check it out. The boyfriend and I hit up Rudy's on a Sunday afternoon around 2:00pm. We were a little surprised to find the parking lot packed and when we walked in there was a long line. At 2:00pm! I'd hate to see the line at the lunch or dinner rush. I've heard the line is often out the door. 

Anyway, we got in line and began to look over our menu choices. We decided on the brisket and the pulled pork. They had a few sides but nothing I was that impressed with. No french fries and no mac n' cheese. But they did have peach cobbler so I got that.

They sell their meat by the pound. Since we were getting it to go we ordered 1/2 lb of brisket and 1/2 lb of pork. For the brisket they literally open up the smoker, take out a huge slab of meat and cut your slices off and weigh it in front of you. Awesome. Meat-tastic even! We grabbed our bag o' meat, some sauce and headed home. 

The meat was very tender and tasty. The sauce is more of a spicy BBQ sauce than sweet but went well on both the brisket and the pork. I liked the pork best, but boyfriend prefers the brisket so everybody wins I guess. And the cobbler was excellent too. 

I'd like to go back and try their prime rib that they make on Sundays. they also make breakfast tacos. Hmmm. Maybe that's what I'll do tomorrow...."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, just hands down amazing moist brisket. When you come in you can automatically tell it's an extremely lively place with the enormous amount of people flooding the restaurant. With a picnic style seating area you don't have to worry about dressing up only to get some nice clothes slopped with delicious BBQ sause."}
{"text":"As a previous yelper stated, I will agree that this place is overrated. The cafeteria style ordering is I guess okay, but getting ur food in a milk crate and then eating off a piece of paper was not appealing. We ordered the turkey, baby back ribs, corn on the cob, and the store bought coleslaw and potato salad. I will say the smoked turkey was delicious, and just full of flavor. The baby back ribs, eh.. The corn on the cob wasn't that good either, kinda tasted like it's been sitting on the cooler then brought back out and re-boiled. Would I return, most likely not given the fact that there are other places through out the valley to try. The price was decent, figure that u will spend about 12-15 a person, you order by the half pound and grab your store bought sides from the cooler. Well if you decide to visit, stick with the turkey cuz the meats arent that good, Well in my opinion."}
{"text":"Rudy Rudy Rudy; I'm in love! I first went to Rudy's with my husband and 2 of our kids. Our daughter lives in San Antonio and we were there in October to visit. She raved about Rudy's so we went and she was right it was delicious! It was attached to the back of a gas station, but hey I already know dive joints have the best grub. Some of the very best smoked BBQ I have ever tasted. 
I was sad to leave San Antonio because this BBQ is just that good!

Fast forward we are back in Phoenix and I am discussing BBQ with a friend and talking about Little Miss BBQ opening in Central Phoenix. I haven't been there yet but I'm going. Anyway I bring up the Yelp app to show some of the LMB reviews and someone mentioned Rudy's! I thought are they in Texas, is this the same Rudy? Faster than my fingers could type I found 2 locations in AZ one in Chandler and one in Goodyear. I am in between both of them! Well this one is on my husbands way home from work! Bonus! I had no Idea this was a chain! I never would have thought it was a chain based on my Texas experience. It truly looks and feels like a mom and pop joint!

Well the very next day I sent my husband to get us some Rudy's for dinner!

Brisket moist - this juicy fatty delicious brisket OMG Brisket nirvana! 
If you don't like fatty meat don't get the moist cut, just be warned that the lean cut is no where near as moist because of the missing fat. 

Turkey - You delicious smoked bird tender and oh so flavorful!

Sausage regular - Smoked to perfection just the right amount of spice nice snap when you bite into it. 

Beans - creamy and delicious not sweet more cowboy beans.

Creamed corn - this is so good, whole kernel sweet corn in a creamy sauce. This is a great compliment to their pulled pork!


In short my favorite item is the Brisket moist cut I give it 10 stars*********"}
{"text":"Driving down I-10 from Phoenix to Tucson my car always finds a way to exit and visit the Chandler location of Rudy's. I don't care that it's a chain. I don't care that there is a store in the restaurant. I don't even care that they don't have plates. I only care about how incredible the smoked brisket tastes. If you like smoked meats and are picky about how it tastes and is made then I encourage you to head to Rudy's, where they do it right.

My recomendation - 1/2 lb Pulled Pork or Brisket, side of slaw, and a 30 minute nap. Your welcome."}
{"text":"Wow, first off you must try the breakfast tacos served from 7am to 10am M-F. They have egg, brisket potato, sausage, jalapeno sausage, spicy chopped and bacon. The bbq pork rids are my favorite
which are thick and juicy. I have tried all of their food and it's ALL good. Gets really busy during dinner time and especially during the weekends. Picnic style seating with red/white table cloths.
There have two self serve fountain machines and an island with cherry peppers, pickles, onion-carrot-pepper mix, extra bbq sauce, napkins, silverware,  straws. All help your self. Clean bathrooms and a huge sink to wash all that bbq sauce off your hands just outside the bathrooms. As you walk in there are two water troughs filled with ice cold beers, sodas and teas. The staff is friendly and will help you first timers order if you get overwhelmed by the variety of menu items. If you love bbq try Rudy's you'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. The location is kind of in an awkward spot. It's on the north side of Chandler Rd just east of the i10. Rudys is frustrating. I enjoy cooking BBQ and mine isn't nearly as good. I love that they let you try all the different meats. I generally go with 1/2lb Prime Rib or 1/2 moist brisket. Both are awesome. You pay by the pound so the majority of the time they overshoot the weight, which is fine. Rudys offers two different sauces, I prefer their normal sauce to the sassy sauce. So here's my only knock on Rudys, their sides are kind of weak. I've tried a majority of them and I just don't think any are up to the standard in which they make the BBQ. The BBQ and service are 5 stars all day long. Sides and price of drinks are maybe 2 stars?"}
{"text":"This is an amazing BBQ restaurant! The food is amazing, it's like being at a family BBQ. Friendly staff, and samples that are very tasty, big and good. Ths knly reason I gave kt 4 stars instead of five was because of the price point.  I wish it was a small margin cheaper because if it was I'd eat there more often. 
Even though, you're not disappointed when your stuffed! I would recommend to anyone the enjoys BBQ."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Ordered brisket (lean) and it was a bit dry for my liking.  Added some sauce and it helped. I should have and recommend the moist brisket.  Added a sausage link, and it was delicious!

Not too many choices for kids.  They do offer grilled cheese (white or wheat bread) and added a bag of chips.  Kids liked it, but again just not a lot for them.

Wife had pulled pork, dabbed on some sissy sauce and she enjoyed it.  Coleslaw and three bean salad were great.  

I saw a gentleman seated nearby ordered the prime rib and it looked awesome.  I know what I'm trying next time.

Overall great Texas style BBQ, this side of town needed it!"}
{"text":"This location is ok but the Rudy's in Austin TX are much better it still is worth trying out if you haven't already"}
{"text":"Food was good, but I felt the prices were a bit high compared to the portion size.  Not sure if I will be back to this place.  Food was good just not great.  Very commercial grade BBQ."}
{"text":"usually good but tonight I ordered baby back 1/2 lb...and a small potato salad.  $12.  eat in.  Got to chair ate five really moist ribs then looked at sixth no meat on bone, dried skin only a tail end.  I guess to get the weight?  so you pay for the weight but don't get the meat...I saw him do it and thought it was strange he cut from a different piece of meat for the last cut but thought ok go with it...nope don't go with it.  ask to look at what they are weighing and look closely......this was around 6pm on a Wednesday Dec 28th, an elderly man cut the meat.  left went home disappointed felt I had been had...then.....1am Thursday morning gurgling and stomach cramps and Herseys well you know...food poisoned, I know the signs by now....it was the potato salad I am sure, usually I eat the coleslaw but wanted something different...well that is what I got different.  lol   to much money to not get what you pay for quality food."}
{"text":"I love Rudy's however this particular Rudy's only gets 4 stars simply because they don't have turkey joes. I'm originally from Albuquerque and that's my favorite thing on the menu. It's not their fault though and they do have great, fast barbecue!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ , great prices . The set up is like joes in downtown Gilbert . Self
Service which seems to move the crowds
Quick during rush hour. I sampled the chicken sandwich , corn on the cob and potato salad . The chicken was great! Moist and smokey . Both BBQ sauces are fantastic . I ended up mixing them together to get a sweet/hot thing going on . In the area ? Give it a try . It's a great value .. In all honesty? I LOVE joes and if given a choice Between these 2 places, I would head to joes ."}
{"text":"I have driven by Rudy's many a times in the past few months and finally decided to give it a try last night. We met some friends here for a going away party and everyone around the table loved the food. The line on a weekend night is long, but well worth the wait. It is very much a family style, no plates, eat with your fingers type of experience so plan accordingly. 

I decided on the pulled pork sandwich and a side of potato salad. The pulled pork was delicious. Served without BBQ sauce so you can add your own. The pulled pork was moist and tender and could have definitely been eaten without BBQ sauce if that's your thing, it's definitely not mine, the more sauce the better. They have two sauce choices. Rudy's original BBQ sauce or Rudy's Sissy Sauce. I of course went for the original seeking some spice and it did not disappoint. It was delicious! The potato salad was just okay, not great, not bad. The pulled pork sandwich with loads of sauce was delicious. This girl didn't mind getting her hands dirty for some good BBQ!

Overall good experience. I will be back for more. From what I hear they have amazing BBQ breakfast tacos which sound different and delicious. I will be back to try those."}
{"text":"This place is really good, but I recommend staying instead of taking your food to go. Portion sizes of meat differs on baked potato I guess because we saw a loaded potato that made us want to order one, so we did, they had to put everything on the side 'to go' and we feel they skimped out big time on the meat. (Looked nothing like the amount given on the order we had previously seen.) The meat, BBQ sauce, potato salad, coleslaw- all were really delicious but completely overpriced. Between the two of us, we spent over $30 (drink not included) for a lbs of meat and a loaded potato with the two small sides. The BBQ sauce was the best thing about this place. We may be back, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"Love the smoked turkey breast and green chili stew. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"If a company is going to engineer an \"experience\" of waiting in an excessive line, picking your own food out of display cases and servicing your own table then the food needs to be so good that the annoying, contrived atmosphere is worth tolerating. This place doesn't pull it off. 

We were lucky enough to not have to wait long but we were still annoyed even after a couple of minutes. The counter server was very nice and asked if this was our first time and offered a couple of samples. The turkey sample was outstanding but the the moist brisket was tasteless and almost all fat. The ordering process, I imagine, would take a couple of trips to get used to offering no combos, just meat by the pound (or half-pound), sausages, and sandwiches. Food is served in a drink crate on heavy brown paper. Everything after that is self-service, self-serve drinks, self-serve utensils, and a sign that says \"Your mother doesn't work here so clean up your mess\". The only redeeming quality was they didn't even offer a tip location on the receipt. 

I ordered the turkey sandwich which is just turkey and bun and a half jalapeno sausage, my GF ordered the half-chicken which turned out to be pretty good but not great. Again, the turkey meat was really flavorful with a nice pepper edge and the jalapeno sausage was pretty good but again, not great. We ordered sides of creamed corn and green-chili stew. Both had good flavor but the corn kernels were undercooked and chewy. They offer Bar-B-Q Sause (their spelling, not mine) at the table. The sissy sauce is vinegar based and kind of bland and the regular sauce is the sissy sauce with lots and lots of cracked black pepper.  I admit sauces are infinitely subjective and someone may like one over the other but I thought both were ordinary.

Rudy's is a corporate chain store trying to recreate a family-style barbecue place and it shows. If I could, I would give a 2.5 star rating for the food but the average food quality doesn't balance the excessively informal atmosphere. Honey Bear's in central Phoenix on Van Buren is an authentic family-style barbecue place and one doesn't mind the wait or serving yourself because the food is unbelievably good. In fact I know the more I self-serve at a place like Honey Bear's the less overhead they have to pay and are more likely to stay in business. Dillon's has excellent food as well and I would go out of my way for a sit-down meal but will probably not be going back to Rudy's."}
{"text":"The breakfast bowls are a great and affordable breakfast. They usually have the food ready by the time I'm done paying too.
Just off the freeway, this is a great stop whether you're stopping in for take out or to dine in."}
{"text":"Big portions, you will not leave hungry. The pulled pork is pretty good. Husband and friends loved the lean brisket. We all agreed the jalapeno sausage was the best. I'm not even a BBQ fan and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"OK, so hear it goes.  Rudy's is new in the West Valley (I-10 & Litchfield Rd.)  I have had friends tell me about it so I wanted to try it.  The place was pretty packed, it was a short wait in a good sized line to get to the food counter.  Once there they will ask you if you have been there before.  If not, they will offer you tastings of the meats and explain the serving to you. There may be several new comers so you will have to deal will people who want to try everything because they don't know what they want. That is irritating but expected.  As it was our first time at Rudy's we wanted to try several items.  We ordered Cutter's Brisket, Turkey, regular Sausage, Rudy's pinto beans, green chili, potato salad, coleslaw & a micro brew bottle beer. They have plenty of beer and beverage choices. Everything was good but the stand out for me was the Turkey.  Get the Turkey! it had excellent flavor and smokiness while remaining moist and tender.  The brisket was dry and not as flavorful. The beans were good but not great. I like great beans. the Coleslaw was very good. The potato salad was my least favorite.  The sausage was huge and it had great flavor.  They offer their brand of BBQ sauce in Sissy or Original (a bit more spicy).  I compare this place to Texas BBQ House, where the brisket is much more flavorful and moist. They do not offer Turkey however. I also like the flavor and consistency of Texas BBQ House's BBQ sauce much better.  Rudy's was good, not a negative experience, I just had higher hopes for a full flavor of brisket I get elsewhere. I prefer Texas BBQ House over Rudy's.  Give Rudy's a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, def loved their pulled pork, baby back ribs and moist brisket. Creamy corn was great. It was our first time there, which they definitely do ask you. They gave us samples which was awesome. Made it easy for us to decide what we wanted to eat."}
{"text":"Come for the breakfast tacos. Load them with brisket and other ingredients and you have some hearty little fellers that will keep you full all day for less than $5.

The moist brisket and sausages are fantastic. Stay away from the lean brisket.

If I was to rate this place on Decor and Breakfast, 5 stars. 

For dinner? You're better off going next door. More sides to choose from and overall better value."}
{"text":"The BBQ Is great. All of it.  Brisket, ribs, pulled pork
Reasonably priced.
Comfortable and relaxed family style dining.
Great patio 

Potatoes are boring.
Peach cobbler, meh

Other than that, all good . Would eat here again"}
{"text":"This is phenomenal barbeque--done in true TX style.  The scents make your mouth water as soon as you walk in.  EVERYTHING on the menu is TOP NOTCH.  We are particular fans of the pulled pork and smoked turkey--could eat those every day three times a day!  The sauces are delicious and not overpowering; tangy, but not doused in sugar or corn syrup like so many other places.  And the prices are great--we ate to the bursting point (2 people) for $22 (no drinks).  Plus, as you walk in / walk out, you have the opportunity to avail yourself of a huge array of BLUE BELL ICE CREAM TREATS!  How can it get any better than this???  This is going to be our new \"go-to\" spot whenever we get a BBQ hankering!"}
{"text":"I want to admit upfront the monthly BBQ cravings I used to have are a lot less frequent nowadays.  Don't know why. But I've passed both Rudy's locations a couple of times in the last six months and I really thought I should give it a shot. 

Well-run operation, efficient. Reasonable prices, I guess.  Great turkey, really great!  Great brisket, mediocre slaw-not enough- flavor.  Corn on the cob?  Yeah, I like butter, too!

Extra credit for the to-go zip locks, available to everyone. 

BBQ sauce is terrific. Got a zing!  I'd go back- truth is I have been back: turkey, pulled pork. Just no slaw.

* Here's my one, NOT so minor complaint: I never once saw an employee smile. Not one time. 15-20 people, all-told, not once. 

* Never heard a single \"thank you\".  Hell, I've been to Texas and part of what I recall IS THE HOSPITALITY!  Not here. Not at all. Which is kind of a bad thing if you're in the HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY!!!

I waited in line for probably 20 minutes. At Rudy's, you get your beverage first, before ordering.  So after receiving my order, I wanted a cold(er) beer to replace the one I'd been hanging into for the 20 minutes in line. A Rudy's employee was standing by the beverages and he scowled at me!  This guy was downright unfriendly - not ideally suited for THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY!!!!  (Where in the Rudy's training manual does it tell this guy it's ok to growl at customers?)

Hey Rudy!  Get your folks to smile, say thank you. Turkey ain't that good you can't smile and say \"thanks for coming\"!"}
{"text":"Meat tasted great, what little I got. Bought three brisket tacos for breakfast. Label says \"brisket, egg, cheese\"; but it should read: eggs, cheese, with a spoon of brisket\". Small spoon is a stretch. It was literally only in the last bite and wasn't even the whole bite.  Love this place for lunch and diner with friends and family but will never get tacos for breakfast again!  And it sure makes harder to come the other times."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time the other night. It is not a \"sit-down\" restaurant, but a counter service establishment. They serve all meats either by weight or in sandwich form. We did not realized that when we made our initial decision to dine there, but serving by weight is actually pretty useful. It allows for a variety of items to be ordered. You are not tied down to a full meal of just one type of meat. They offer a variety of options such as chicken, pork, beef, turkey, sausage, and even prime rib (although they seem to sell out of the prime rib quickly). Both my fiance and I tried the spicy chopped brisket. Very, very good. I believe that it is their only beef option that is already soaked in BBQ sauce. They serve most, if not all of their meats plain, and allow you to add the BBQ sauce at the table. The spicy chopped brisket was very tender and moist and had a great flavor. 
We really only had two major complaints. 
1. Only two choices of BBQ sauce 
2. Very limited side dish options. No mac & cheese, no mashed potatoes. Unless you like beans, coleslaw, or corn on the cob you are pretty much out of luck. We did try the red potatoes but they were far from stellar. Just boiled red potatoes cubes in a pool of butter. No seasoning. 
Overall the main dish was great, but I would pass on the side dishes next time.   I will definitely be back to try out some of their other meats."}
{"text":"Drove in from Los Angeles for my Powerlifting meet and checked into our hotel, and went straight to eat here because of the Yelp reviews... 

Spot was 
Fast, 
Fresh, and 
Had amazingly Yummy food

\"Brisket Moist--Turkey-- and Sausage!


Definitely going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Typically every time I come here I leave full off of delicious food. Yesterday my grandma and I went in because it's been forever since we've had BBQ. We both ordered brisket sandwiches and I got a side of cream corn and she got potato salad and a corn on the cob. After eating my meal I started to feel extremely sick and light headed and extremely nauseous. My grandma and I had to head back home because I was feeling awful. As soon as I got home I was beyond sick. I had gotten food poisoning. I was upset about it because I typically love Rudy's food and the service and have never experienced this. Unfortunately I will not be returning back.. Having to miss work and stay at home feeling awful is not worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was friendly. Place was very loud but it was expected. The atmosphere was very different from anything I've ever experienced, very country-like...you almost forget you're In arizona! Wouldn't go there on a date but definitely go back for some filling barbeque. Also, I loved how simple the menu was."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend and neither of us were impressed with the food. She had the brisket sandwich which completely lacked any sort of flavor along with corn on the cob which was soggy and inedible. As for me I had the baby back ribs which were OK but far from great. I would not recommend this place to any friend and will certainly not be coming back."}
{"text":"The best brisket I've had in Arizona! And the jalape√±o links were just the right amount of spice. The coleslaw & potato salad are to be expected. Wouldn't say they're amazing, however they compliment the main dishes nicely. The sassy bbq is unbelievably delicious! Just found my new go-to bbq spot in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Came home to find Rudy's BBQ waiting for me driven directly from Phoenix all the way to San Diego. 5+ hours in the car and the quality/taste still held up. Apparently you order by the pound, so I had 0.5lb of both brisket and chicken waiting for me. Definitely wayyyy more than enough for one person. #MeatSweats 

The brisket and chicken were well cut and seasoned. They both went well with the  Sissy \"Sause\" and Original \"Sause\". I tried a bit of the baked beans which were ok, should probably heat it up. Cream o'corn is BOMB - I'm currently/happily eating what little is left of it. (Corn not pictured because \"aint nobody got time for that\").

Rudy's make your way to San Diego please!"}
{"text":"5 stars, period.  

On a side note, what location scout genius decided to open another bbq restaurant right next door?  They will be out of business in less than three months, based on proximity alone.  Too da fxxkin' loo!

Eat at Rudy's today!  It's the best."}
{"text":"Good place for BBQ. Neat set up with the way you get your food. It's all a la carte style. The decor is homey and open....quite comfortable. 
Once in line, you can choose from a variety of bottled drinks or can order a fountain drink at the end. Then you can choose a cold side and/or dessert such as cole slaw or pudding. Then on to the main attraction...a large cutting station behind the registers where you order sits several cuts of meat to choose from. And the best part is you can try any (or all) of them before buying. This really made the difference. 
I tried the pulled pork, the lean brisket and the moist brisket. I ended up with the moist brisket sandwich. It was amazingly tender. I also choose the chocolate pudding (YUMMY) and corn on the cob. All the food was delicious. 

Pro: You can set your own meal. Price is by the half pound so if you want a bit more, that is a plus. Also, you don't have to have a set meal. It's what you make of it.

Con: First time here, and I felt a bit rushed while in line. This made it a bit stressful. Also, I would suggest to add salt to your dish as it was a bit lacking in the meal. 

Overall: I would go again, just because I can get something different every time and I can taste before I buy."}
{"text":"We LOVE Rudy's BBQ!! We no longer live in Arizona, so anytime we fly home we always stop by Rudy's on our way from the airport! The moist brisket melts in your mouth and both pork ribs and baby back ribs are amazing! The corn on the cob and red potatoes doused in butter make my belly very happy! And of course you have to get a cup of banana pudding to end the feast off right!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to get in without a day where the line was out the door.  My sons has the pork ribs, and lean brisket, I had a pulled pork sandwich and we shared the. New potatoes.   
My sandwich was sooo greasy that the bottom bun was completely soaked, my sons lean brisket was even more greasy.   The was papers that the items are served on were so soaked - they ripped on us. My son liked his ribs but let me warn you 3 ribs are a half a pound and did nothing to fill him up.   The new potatos are literally cut up red potatoes swimming in melted butter.    The BBQ sauce has hardly any taste.    Will not be going again."}
{"text":"I stopped off to have some food on my way to PHX airport to pick up my wife, who was flying in to visit me.  I was hungry, so I pulled into Rudy's for dinner.

I ordered the ribs.  The cashier asked me if I wanted Potatoes.  I asked if they were boiled.  She said \"yes,\" so I said \"no thanks.\"  I didn't notice, but she charged me for them anyway.  She put my ribs onto my tray, took my money and I went to a table to eat.

As I looked at my receipt, I saw that she charged me for the Potatoes, but she didn't give them to me.  I looked and saw this particular cashier serving a family of 5 people.  I needed to get going to pick up my wife on time, so I decided I didn't have the time to fight the line to ask for a refund.  I let them keep the money.

Wouldn't be so bad, except that my ribs were the most rubbery ribs I can recall eating.  Chewy like an old tire.  Not that flavorful, either.  Yuk!

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't kid yourselves...this isn't great BBQ.  It is good though.  The sauces are pretty bad.  That's OK with as I like to taste the meat and not an overwhelming sauce.  It's tacky in it's atmosphere but comfortable.  You could do worse for a casual lunch or cheap dinner.  If you're strictly in it for the BBQ though, I'd take a ride to the Texas BBQ House."}
{"text":"This is the best bbq place around. I love the vibe and it makes me feel like I'm back home in Texas. I recommend Rudy's for breakfast tacos or turkey and brisket with creamed corn for lunch. I also will add they sell wonderful seasoning that I use at home for cooking just about anything. The service is always friendly and fabulous. I can't think of anything else to say about this place. Give it a try !"}
{"text":"I would have given this location four stars, but they lost one because the green chili stew just wasn't that good, and it's usually one of my favorite things to get at a Rudy's.  Fortunately, everything else on my tray was as good as I'm used to getting chain wide.  The brisket being a particular favorite, closely followed by the pulled pork, and they apparently serve breakfast now, so I'll have to stop in for brisket breakfast tacos sometime soon.  
   At any rate, Rudy's is one of the better BBQ chains out there, and frankly they're better than many mom and pop shacks I've been to over the years. My only drawback to coming here, is that my eyes are usually bigger than my stomach, but that just means I have leftovers! Every cloud etcetera."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of BBQ, but it's Father's Day and my dad went to the Texas location on a job, so he was excited to see there was one in here. We went and I was very impressed!! It was great!! BBQ sauce is typically to sweet for me and the meat is often over cooked. But NOT here!! It was amazing!!! I'll come again when I'm in town next and highly recommend everyone give it a try."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is always excellent!  We always get the baked potatoes with sour cream, butter, cheese, and a meat of your choice.  So delicious we used to come here weekly! Everyone here is friendly and I love that it's no frills and just great food!  Definitely do yourself a favor and try this place if you are looking for good food in a casual environment."}
{"text":"First time here and i was not impressed. I can't wrap my head around the fact they are a bbq place but none of the meats come with bbq sauce on them. We chose the half chicken which was nice and tender for the most part as well as the baby back ribs which i was not a fan of at all. The potato salad wasn't anything special and made with mustard which ruined it and the coleslaw was mediocre. I didnt feel like i had ordered from a BBQ restaurant at all. I would have much rather preferred  Piggly's at the Fair in Mesa! We did recieve good customer service though being as it was our first time, the cashier was very helpful and provided us with a few samples but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great prices, delicious options.
Two sause options, both of which were really tasty.  The bottles on the other hand and the dispenser top were lame but it works.
I liked the sample before you decide option.  You come in and if this is your first time they allow you to sample a few of the meats before you decide.  Great opportunity to taste before you order.
So many great tasting meat options too.  I like the moist beef brisket which is well marbled.  Unfortunately sometimes it has more marbling (fat) that I would prefer.
You get what you pay for here.  Meat is cut and weighed and charged accordingly."}
{"text":"Since the last time, the BBQ has improved and now tastes like the Texas locations. Delicious BBQ unlike anything you can find in LA. Yum!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Have been for breakfast and lunch. Had the potato with turkey and it was excellent. Reminded me of Larry's BBQ is Dothan, Al where I used to get a potato with chicken. Hubby said the pulled pork sand which was the best he has ever had, but didn't care for the coleslaw. I like that you seat yourself and carry your own food to the table as it eliminates the usual $8 tip for the two of us at a typical sit-down restaurant....  Also liked that the kids fit well on their large drinks and the straws were easy to remove from their wrappers--hate straws in plastic wrappers as I tend to crack the straw and then it makes it hard to drink. Line moves fairly fast. Oh--hubby really like the potato salad."}
{"text":"Wonderful BBQ. I love the brisket and the BBQ sauce to try out is amazing. My daughter loves the bannana pudding dessert. I can't get enough of the sweet tea either. My only complaint is the tables are always dirty, it would be great if someone would go around and wipe them down between patrons."}
{"text":"I enjoyed every thing I have ordered here. We have come back a few times. I like that I can order bits of different things. Best pic a nic table place ever. Sauces are wonderful. Go to the condiments bar (I missed it on my first visit). Get a little or lot of everything and share. Sides are good but last time we ordered a loaded potato and split that. Made our own sides."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Rudy's for the first time last night. Because we were newbies, our cashier pulled out tons of samples for us to try, including lean brisket, peach cobbler, creamed corn, and beans. Everything was delicious, but we ended up ordering moist brisket, baby back ribs, pulled pork sandwich, and sausage. Everything was delicious! The crust on the brisket was amazing. The sausage was just spicy enough. And, the ribs were tasty even without sauce. This is a great, casual place to bring a family, and service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I love Rudy's. Even though I'm not a big bbq fan. Their moist brisket is amazing. But i gotta say their cream corn is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Came here for Spring training.  My husband was wearing his Salt Lick BBQ shirt.  The manager came over and greeted us along with all of the other customers coming in that day.  He went above and beyond asking us if everything was great.  Talk about customer service.  He made sure to keep checking back on us about"}
{"text":"Visited here from Orange County while on a trip to see some friends living in Chandler. We had an amazing meal!

We ordered 2 pounds of ribs, 1 pound of brisket moist, 1/2 pound of pulled pork, 1/4 pound of spicy brisket, some new potatoes and a baked potato. 

The best part of the meal was easily the spicy brisket. It was so moist and flavorful, and not too spicy. I wasn't too big of a fan of the ribs and needed to add more BBQ to flavor them. Everything else was amazing and was some of the best BBQ we had. 

They also take your order fairly quickly and I love that they have it hot and ready. It is so much nicer than waiting!

My only complaint was the young lady who took my order. She did not seem happy to be working and was very rude to us because we had a larger order. Other than that, we were very happy with everything!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. That's how you'll feel after eating here. The staff was helpful, but the meat by and large is lacking in flavor. All the sauces are on the side and the BBQ sauces are ok at best. I got the pork baby back ribs- flavorless and sad. I got the moist brisket and it was moist, but no flavor at all. Got the new potatoes and they were also rather bland. It was a waste of money. 

If you're in the mood for some good BBQ like I was, look elsewhere, you're gonna be mad eating here.

I won't be back"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and very impressed with the food. Your corn soaked in butter was heaven!!"}
{"text":"This place was just like the one I went to in Texas! The meat was so juicy and tasty.....I wanted more and more. The cashier was so helpful and provided my daughter with some samples. Great selection of drinks. This is a MUST TRY place if you're in Chandler!"}
{"text":"The moist brisket here is truly the best in the valley,  hands down.   My friend from out of state had been telling me about this place for years,  so when they finally opened up the Chandler location I was totally stoked.   On my first visit,  we were a little disappointed with the no plates thing,  but once we dug into the food,  we forgot about that quick.   The potato salad is one of the better sides, and their beans are great too. The brisket (sold by the 1/2 pound) has a smokiness that permeates your senses and makes you want to eat the entire portion by yourself! But don't be selfish,  sharing a little with your dining companion will give you shared stories of BBQ excellence for years to come. And if you happen to have friends the live where there are no Rudy's and keep frothing at the mouth every time you even mention the name,  remind them they will ship brisket anywhere in the USA. 

And remember the breakfast tacos! Brisket with egg and cheese wrapped up in a flour tortilla... Man oh man are they good. Just get there before 9am on the weekends,  otherwise you may miss out."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere of Rudy's.  There were 5 of us and we had half a chicken, brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, corn and cole slaw. The meat was very moist and had a great smoky flavor. The food was very tasty and the sauce was delicious. A little bit of a spicy flavor but not overwhelming.  The line was long but moved very quickly.  We also enjoyed a bucket of beers. I liked the casual feel and the picnic tables. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I would have liked to see a combo plate on the menu."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite and roll up your sleeves. This is my favorite place to eat in Albuquerque and finally they are here....I drive 35 miles to eat and am glad to do it.
The Jalapeno Sausage and Lean brisket are my favorites, but I love everything they smoke...The real deal when you can smell the smoke in the parking lot...PS  try the banana pudding..."}
{"text":"Being new to Arizona I can't give Rudy's 5 stars however if this was Oregon I would have scored them a 5. Great green chili stew and cream corn not to mention the moist brisket. Everything is good these are just my favs"}
{"text":"I like the customer service when you enter to help you if you're a first timer. We got the half pound of baby back ribs which were eh so so-too fatty and not enough meat. The beans and coleslaw had no flavor, but the pulled pork sandwich was good. The condiment at was nice; it was supplied with pickles, jalape√±os, onions, and silverware.  The sauce is great and there's even a little store when you first come in where you can purchase some. This place has a lot of potential-great building, fun concept, decent prices, they just need better tasting food."}
{"text":"I order from here roughly once a month and it's always good. Today we had them cater a pickup order for my daughters birthday and the food was amazing. I had ordered for 20 and there was nothing left. Everyone loved the pulled pork and brisket. Thank you Rudy's, job well done."}
{"text":"Switch to Rudy's and save!
The sandwiches used to leave me feeling hungry. But not anymore! Now that I switched to loaded Potato with meat- my hunger is gone!
Thank you Rudys!!!!
But seriously folks, I moved down the road some years ago and don't get to visit as often. This place is affordable with great tasting BBQ. Try if one and you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ but terrible customer service! You'd think they could fake it for a first (and last) time customer. I hate when people act like they don't want to help you. I hate when they act like you made them put in the job application, go to the interview and accept the job. I have questions, sorry if you have to actually interact with someone. I work hard for my pennies so when I spend my money I want to feel appreciated or at the very least not like a fool for supporting a business with awful service. No thanks, there are many alternatives with great customer service that will allow me to avoid this place."}
{"text":"This is the second time in a row I have come to this location  and been Hugely Disappointed by the Brisket.    

    Also, on my first visit here I found the pulled pork to be way over cooked, so bad it was mushy!!!   It was like it spent an entire day in the steam table or something...  So I thought I would try the brisket next time instead.   Wrong!!

        Both tonight and my last visit I ordered the \"moist\" brisket and both times it has been so TOUGH that it was mostly inedible.  
 I gave them the benefit of the doubt after the first brisket disaster, but TWICE? 

   You can't ruin brisket two visits in a row and expect to stay in business....  

Plus, don't forget the mushy pulled pork from my first visit here and you will understand why I gave this place a one star rating!!!


    I have posted a photo of my meat the way it was served to me tonight, and it looks like they just sliced off the top layer of fat and served it that way..... Check it out and you will agree. Nobody could eat what I paid almost $7 for. See photo....   :(

       Total waste of money and I will never come back again!  

    Three strikes, your out!!

        I would advise anyone looking for BBQ in Goodyear to look elsewhere for it.  

        Just so you understand, I have been to Rudy's other locations in both Texas and Oklahoma and this BBQ is not up to those standards!!  I think it's just this location..

         I gave it one star, but it truly did not even deserve that....."}
{"text":"Always love Rudy's BBQ. The meats are smoked and taste wonderful. Ordered the moist Brisket, Jalapeno Sausage and the smoked Turkey. The flavor was outstanding. I liked this location because of the garage doors that roll up next to the tables. It was a nice cool day and the breeze outside was wonderful sitting there eating lunch. I have always frequented the location in Chandler but was passing by and decided to try this location out. The food was wonderful and the place was clean and well stocked. You can't go wrong here. Do your taste buds a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"I really like the ribs, turkey, sausage and breakfast taco's. I have ate here quite a few times since they opened a few years ago. The price is a little high and I do not like the set up being so open if you eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not worth it. Beans were the worst. Overpriced & terrible. Arizona has no clue what good BBQ is supposed to taste like.

Their signature sauces were either too vinegary or too much pepper. So not worth any of the hype."}
{"text":"I've been to a few good places in Austin and was much looking forward to Phoenix's version of Rudy's.  To me, the brisket as a little dry and the bread was underwhelming - just regular white sliced bread you can get at Costco.  I remember asking around at the end of the meal and we all thought it was OK.  

I was really looking forward to this as my friends in Austin rave about this place but I will probably look for a different BBQ joint for my next Brisket run."}
{"text":"We got the ribs and they were amazing, fall off the bone deliciousness! The half pound brisket was too fatty and chewy for me to even finish. The service though was HORRIBLE! The cashier looked miserable and was rude. Although, the guy who cleaned our table, I believe his name was Chris, was extremely nice and actually had a conversation with us unlike the unfriendly cashier. So all in all I'd have to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to Rudys , it looked great inside I thought the prices we really inexpensive the food was good ! One of my sons had a brisket sandwich and it had a lot of fat on it that was a definite turn off so that's why I'm rating it a 3 . We tried the pudding they had for dessert banana and chocolate the banana was great !! I thought the music was great  overall I think they need to be aware of the fat and take it off the meat before they send it out !! I should have taken a picture of all the fat that came out of that sandwich it was a lot so I'm not sure if this is an every day occurrence or not but I will try them again  to see !"}
{"text":"Service and restaurant was great . Very easy to order and cool concept or putting meat on butcher paper and serving in soda holder bin . The meat I got was misuse brisket - good flavor and tender . Jalape√±o sausage - fantastic . Pork ribs - lacked flavor and salty almost Brine tasting . BBQ sauces on table lacked flavor as well."}
{"text":"A taste of home!  This was a staple back in Round Rock, TX and it's something we've missed since living in AZ.  I could hardly believe my eyes!  Its nestled conveniently across from a Whataburger, so it's almost like Little Texas!  So it's not got the charm of a convenience store/gas station like the ones I'm used to, and okay, there's no giant Rudy's \"Sause\" dispenser, but I very quickly got over that. (But can they maybe do something about those slow dispensing bottles at the table?!)

The long cooler had plenty ice cold Shiner Bock, so that scored some points right off the bat.  Service was super friendly, even if a bit slow (quality takes time, I had to remind myself), and though most of the same quality exists, there's just one thing keeping me from giving 5 stars: chewy brisket.  The flavor is there but it's just missing on texture.  Turkey and sausage were right on.

I was pleased with my favorites, new potatoes and creamed corn.  The beans looked and smelled reeeally good, but I personally didn't try any.  

I know I'll be going back here, getting my fix and taking a little flavor trip back home."}
{"text":"Delicious Meat!   If you're a first timer they will give you samples.  We tried the brisket, the chopped brisket, pulled pork, turkey and hot sausage.   Yum.  

We ended up ordering lean brisket, turkey, pulled pork and a hot link.  The brisket was good when hot, but got pot roasty as it cooled down.  The chopped brisket - which we didn't order was pretty good and we might get that next time.   Hubby liked the hot link - for me the skin was too poppy.  Pulled pork was a little greasy - but tasty.  The big surprise was the turkey - excellent.

Side dishes were just so so - the cole slaw was ok - but the beans were blah.  

It was a little noisy and not the most comfortable place - long tables - metal folding chairs - friendly atmosphere.

We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic BBQ!!! I totally recommend Rudy's.  The food, atmosphere and customer service is out of this world.  

Baby Back Ribs, cream corn, brisket sandwich is so good.  

You have to try it out."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying I'd never been to a Rudy's before and Texas BBQ is my least favorite of the 4 major BBQ's (not a huge fan of brisket). My friends and I had heard Rudy's opened up a restaurant in Chandler and that it was supposed to be great. We decided to brave the line about a week ago and give it a whirl. I must say, it was definitely worth the wait! 

I went with the St. Louis style ribs and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The meat came off with a fork, just the way it's supposed to. As a side I ordered the green chile stew. It was good, but nothing to write home about. Friends went with the lean brisket, the chicken, and a brisket sandwich. We all enjoyed everything. The beer selection was good and it was nice that you could grab it while waiting in line. We also liked that you put the sauce on yourself, deciding how much or how little you wanted.  

Only 4 stars (or probably 3.5 really), because they were OUT of pulled pork! No pulled pork? We couldn't believe it. That and the sides were just okay: we had the stew, the cole slaw, and potato salad."}
{"text":"Good for what it is.The potoato salad and BBQ is very tasty.If you dont want to drive and just want yummy BBQ you cant go wrong."}
{"text":"I took a group of 10 to Rudy's at 6:00 on Saturday night. While it was a bit crowded, they were easily able to accommodate our party and allowed us to be seated in the private room. The atmosphere was essentially a knock off of some places I have been in Texas, as was the food. 

On entering the line passes by 2 big tubs filled with ice and beer and pop. The assortment of beers that are mostly from Texas was very interesting to find. The cold salads are in a fridge to your left, but with no signage telling you that you have to pick one up there if you wish to eat on the premises.

Next was the main counter. For those who have never eaten Texas style BBQ, you order by the partial or full pound and it is placed on butcher paper on your tray (or in this case crate). I ordered an assortment of meats including the moist brisket, sausage, ribs, and prime rib. I also got the cole slaw, creamed corn, and for dessert, peach cobbler. I opted to skip the bottled drinks and buy a cup to fill at the soda dispenser which is a lot cheaper.

Upon finding my seat, I found there were two sauces for those who prefer their meat that way, along with some hot sauce. There is also a condiment bar where you can get your silverware(plastic) as well as jalapeno's and packets of everything from mustard to horseradish sauce.

The brisket was extremely moist and easily cut with plastic implements. I felt is could have used a bit more seasoning as it usually is in Texas. Next I sampled the sausage. I felt it could have used more spice in it, and ended up having to put mustard on it to be able to eat it comfortably. Unfortunately, the ribs were very tough, and after a number of tries to bite through them I finally abandoned them to the trash can. Last of the meats was the prime rib. A very nice piece of almost medium rare beef, lightly smoked. While the beef was very nice, once again the lack of seasoning caused me to downgrade the experience.

The coleslaw was nothing special, as it was chopped in a buffalo chopper, but my money is on the creamed corn. What a winner! The brisket with the creamed corn could have easily been my entire meal. In retrospect, I wish I had purchased a quart of the creamed corn to bring home it was that good.

Last was the peach cobbler. The cup I was given was almost all pastry, with just a little peach sauce on it. Nowhere did I ever get a bite of a peach. This was a total waste of money.

Other members of our group ordered the potato filled with pulled pork. The portion was very large, but once again, the meat was lacking in flavor. 

On the negative side, about 7:30 the place filled with smoke so bad that our eyes were watering. Apparently, they put out the fire pits at that time, and the lack of ventilation makes it a real problem. 

BBQ is not a cheap meal. While what I ordered was larger than the average person might order, it still was over $45. Quite a high amount for the quality of food that was received. 

It should also be noted that they serve breakfast tacos which are said to be quite good. In my next review of them.

2 Stars for uniqueness and cleanliness."}
{"text":"After much hype from co-workers, I stopped by for a mid-week dinner. First off, the vibe as soon as you walk in it that of a lunch joint.  It basically looks like a cafeteria.  You shuffle through line and select drinks and sides from the cooler on your way to the counter. Once there, you order and food comes up pretty fast.  The food is served on wax paper, and there are no plates.  Also, no silverware, just plastic utensils. This may be a traditional way to serve BBQ, but when it comes time to cut your brisket, an actual plate and silverware would be nice.  I ended up getting more than one bite with wax paper stuck to the bottom of the brisket.

I ordered the Jalapeno sausage, lean brisket, and corn on the cob.  The sausage was excellent, but again difficult to cut with a plastic knife.  I should have ordered the moist brisket, because the lean brisket was very dry.  The corn was over-cooked and over-buttered.  They have a couple BBQ sauces, neither of which were anything to write home about.  They don't sell corn bread... that's right, no corn bread!  Overall I was not impressed with the food at all.

Service was friendly, and they clear your table when they see empty plates... sorry empty wax papers.  Prices are reasonable.  Rudy's seems like a good spot for lunch BBQ, but don't expect excellence here."}
{"text":"Ok I've been here about 10 or more times and I still love Rudy's the same as I first tasted them in Austin a few years ago. This place rules! Get the choice cut of brisket and try some smoked turkey and throw in a half link while your add it. You won't be disappointed. I've never been!  Overall my favorite BBQ here in Phx until I can be proven wrong. If this is not the best one in Phx, then it's one of them in almost everyone's list. I love Rudy's!"}
{"text":"Oh how I really love Rudy's. I've been to one in Austin, and been to the Chandler one probably 10 times. My go to place on the way to Tucson. I love the fact that they consistently have good BBQ at any time of the day. Yes are there better BBQ places in Phx, and most recently I've fallen in love with Little Miss BBQ, but you can't always get food there, ie they run out quick and long lines. Rudy's is always good food at good prices all the time. 

As with the Chandler location when it was new lines at Rudy's were very long. After the hoopla is done, the lines died down. I've heard the lines can be long here at the Goodyear location, but we came at 9pm on a Tuesday and were served right away. Their moist brisket was excellent and we ordered turkey. We also tried the banana pudding. Great at well. 

Overall this is a perfect addition to Phoenix. I wish they would open one up on I 17 so I can get my BBQ on in all directions leaving and coming back from a road trip. 

Also, their original BBQ sauce is the best ever. I always buy a bottle when I come and use it on my BBQ and other food at home. You really can't beat it!

Again, you can't go wrong with great food at Rudy's."}
{"text":"I like this place in like the set up. The only issue I have is the barbecue sauce, if you don't like it you're not gonna wind up liking the food here because it's pretty much smothered in it. I truly wish they had options for barbecue sauce in terms of different kinds like sweet, sweet and spicy,hot or regular etc.  I've taken a few of my friends here and it's really been hit and miss I would say about a quarter of them really like it a lot, and The rest of them seem to wonder why they only have one choice of barbecue sauce. I've taken several people I know here who come to visit, and if I'm out of about 10 of those people only to have a girl wanted to go back. That's usually the telltale sign for me in terms of how people like or don't like a place"}
{"text":"While their BBQ is pretty good, the little breakfast burritos they make in the morning are not.

I ordered about six of these greasy things to share with my coworkers and felt sick the rest of the day.

I am pretty sure they gave me the scoots.

Avoid their breakfast, because the food will make you sick and regretful."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The moist brisket was so juicy and tasty.  The creamed corn was delicious,  and their turkey was pretty juicy too. The cashier was a super nice guy. Told him we were there for the first time there and he gave us samples of two sides and two meats. 
We are definitely going tomake this an annual stop when visiting for pring training."}
{"text":"This seems to be a place you either love or really dislike. They were quite busy for a sunday night at 8pm so they do have some fans, however, this place is not for me.

Pros
Turkey was good with the bbq sauce

Beef brisket was well cooked although to smokey almost a lighter fluid taste

Cole slaw is simple fresh and tasty.

Cons

Pork ribs were undercooked in my opinion.
Sent them back.

Jalepeno suasage was dry.

The ordering and dining concept is terrible.
There are no plates, you eat your meal on a less than 
paper thin piece of wax paper. So once the juice and grease from your food soaks into the paper...your food is essentially sitting in direct contact with the table. Seems unsanitary and Its a mess. 

Overpriced."}
{"text":"How do you run out of pulled pork at 7:30 on a Saturday night?!  You're a BBQ place!  All I wanted was some great pulled pork sandwiches for my birthday.  Wait in line for 10 min and they tell me they are out for at least an hour. Come on guys!!"}
{"text":"Some of the most tender delicious brisket I've ever had hands down!!! I've been here twice they have fast and great service! I've never had customer service astound me as they have here at Rudys the greeter was so nice and even got us a car seat carrier for my newborn with out asking. The environment was awesome and the customers here are very friendly! I would recommend any1 to Rudys and my wife recommends the pulled pork sandwich! The prices are low for a very large amount of food I will definitely be coming back! I suggest if your in the area and want some great food stop at Rudys! Also if your a sports guys they always have the game on every Sunday!"}
{"text":"Moist brisket and pork ribs are solid and some of the best I've ever had.  But that's it.  The sides are borderline offensive.  So it's hard to go there unless I want nothing but a plate of meat."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! One of the best BBQ I've had. There two bbq sauces are great! I personally prefer the spicy one not the sissy one lol love their cream corn. The jalepeno sausage is the best if you like spicy. All the meats are good. If you get brisket get the moist. Prices are reasonable. Pretty friendly staff. If you go there when it's busy cover your ears they sure shout (out orders) a lot gave me a headache lol :-/"}
{"text":"Went back today the casheir was rude and slow no name tag by the receipt said her name was Rehana, any way she sucked. The food was sub parr and everything seemed to have a strong vinegar flavor."}
{"text":"In Texas I would rate Rudy's about three stars however in the Phoenix area it is the best there is. They have nice moist brisket where you can actually see and taste the smoke ring. To me, you judge a good BBQ place by their brisket and this place holds it's own. If brisket is not smoked long enough it just tastes like crappy pot roast. That is unfortunately the case with most places in the valley. The only other place I can recommend around here is Texas BBQ House in Phoenix although once Rudy's moved in, even though Rudy's is a chain I have to say they are still slightly better. The Green Chile Stew is really great tasting. As is the turkey and Jalapeno sausage. Overall, if you are looking for good BBQ in the valley this is the best you are going to find."}
{"text":"My favorite of all time.  Same set up as other locations in Tx that I've tried and just as good.  I could eat here every day.  Had brisket, sausage, turkey and creamed corn.  Loved it all.  Only thing missing was the Lone Star longneck from the iced trough.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Update 3/7/16: Received a call from Andy from Rudy's. He thoroughly apologized for out experience, and did all he could to make it right. I do appreciate his call and his willingness to make the situation right. Looking forward to giving it a try again in the future. 


Went there last night. Closes at 10 PM, we showed up at 8. 

Last time, had a great experience. The staff was nice and attentive, and ready to help us figure out what we wanted. 

This time, not so much. As soon as we went to the counter, the first thing out of the mouth was the gentleman at the counter was \"here or to go\" gruffly, followed by slamming down the tray on the counter. My girlfriend and I looked at each other, we knew how this was going to go. Probably should have left at that point. He then said \"You're gonna order one of the ton's of stuff we don't have\" so I asked about a baked potato-which we came all the way from central Phoenix to have-and he said they were out. Fine, but I deferred to my girlfriend to order so I could re-evaluate what I wanted. (At this point, she asked if I wanted to go somewhere else, I said, No we are already here. Nothing super rude about that.) We ordered, and he gruffly took it and slapped together what we ordered. Fine dude, whatever.

Food was good, but there was no flavor to the spicy chop. 

After eating the sandwich, I thought I'd go up for a small green chile stew, as I wasn't full yet. I walked to the counter and the same gentleman said \" what do you want\" and I asked if they still had stew, or if they had run out of it. Didn't ask rudely. He looked and said yes, so I ordered some. While getting the stew, he said to the other fella behind the grill \"this is one of the two that came in for stuff we didn't have, they got mad at me like it was my fault.\" I was a little shocked, was this guy actually taking shit about me right in front of me? He slammed down the stew in front of me and said \"it's on the house\" and walked away. I tried to pay for it-I don't need this asshole's charity-and he barked \"NO\" at me. 

This was a terrible visit to a good place. I'm not going out of my way to be disrespected like that."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are always on the lookout for good BBQ, so when this place opened up not too far from us, we got quite excited!  We noticed the reviews were up and down, but we like to make our own decisions, so we decided to check it out tonight.

We weren't in the mood to \"go out\", so we ordered our BBQ and went to pick it up.  We chose brisket, pulled pork, baby back ribs, cole slaw and baked beans.  The smell in the car was wonderful, and we couldn't wait to dig into the bag.  Once home, we put everything out on the counter and went at it.

The one overwhelming flavor was pepper...not chili pepper, but cracked pepper.  I don't mind a peppery flavor, but it was everywhere and a bit too much, in my opinion.  The sauces we got were \"original\" and \"sissy\".  The sissy sauce was for me, and there was cracked pepper in that, too.  Hubby went for the original, and he really didn't seem to enjoy it too much.

The only thing I found redeeming was the pulled pork, so that's what I ended up eating.  I tried the brisket, but it wasn't to my liking.  Also, the ribs were alright, but they were a bit tough.  The cole slaw was of the chunky variety, it wasn't bad, but wasn't great, either.  However, the baked beans weren't what I was expecting.  In my mind, they're usually somewhat sweet and flavorful.  These were bland and reminded me of bad refried beans.  When we were tasting them, my hubby made a comment about putting them in a burritto, because they looked like some we've seen in Mexican restaurants.

On the good side, we have plenty of white bread to last us through the weekend...they serve it with the BBQ.

I'm sad to say, we were highly disappointed.  Will we try it again?  Probably not.  And, that's too bad, because there aren't really any BBQ places in our area.  I guess we're destined to long drives for the kind of BBQ we enjoy."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here, at my husband's recommendation, and I'm glad I went! We're from the East Coast and have been craving good BBQ. We had found one place that was close but Rudy's is spot on! Only thing they're lacking is French fries ;) I had the baked potato and the smoked turkey and my husband got the pulled pork sandwich and beans. Price wise, the meat was worth the price, I had leftovers for another meal, but the baked potato wasn't worth the $4-something. A baked potato with butter only shouldn't cost that much but I wanted one so I sucked it up and paid it. For two people, we paid about $25 which I guess is average around here. You do have to clean up after yourself as well, no servers. They also offer a military discount."}
{"text":"From the minute I walked in, I was greeted and the restaurant was explained to me. They have me samples and even gave a military discount. Food was amazing. Turkey was so juicy and the house bbq sauce was on point. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"What a neat place. Was first off by ordering then sitting. Looking for a real restaurant but thought what the heck, I'm here. Long line moved fast, told the cashier I was a first timer. Got a couple samples. Loved the lean brisket. So got that with the green chili stew and potato salad. Half pound was too much for 1 but was tender and flavorful. Potato salad was good and chili was interesting. Never had that greem chili but it was very good. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Horrible brisket. I love Rudy's. I first learned about Rudy's when I lived in Austin and I fell in love with their moist brisket. A year or so ago I was in Phoenix and I went to the other location (the higher rated one btw) and I found the quality and flavor to be the same. I was in Phoenix again this weekend and dropped in to this location for the same moist brisket and it was dry and rubbery. I ordered a 1/2 pound (the minimum) and ate four bites off of four different slices and all of them were awful. Avoid this location. I don't know what they are doing but whatever it is, it's doing the chain a disservice."}
{"text":"the lesser of 2 bbq evils.
as i said in my review or cant stop smokin bbq I LOVE BBQ & couldnt wait 4 both these to open, but then the disappointment.
WHAT IS UP WITH THIS BY THE POUND ORDERING STYLE????
Ive never dealt with this b4 and Ive been all around the country! and all of the sudden 2 rest. within 300 ' of each other both do it??? oh well, about the food.
it smells great outside!
the layout is better than css bbq
I was urged to try samples, which is great
i got the turkey, and bought a hunk of cheese (???)
THEY ONLY HAVE 2 BBQ SAUCES & they arent even much different?!
coleslaw was really plain.
the \"school lunch\" type seating is dumb, i dont want to be forced to eat with strangers
and im out of jr. high!!"}
{"text":"Decent BBQ with a country feel. You line up, order your food, grab some sides, sit on a picnic bench/table and chow down. The price is okay.

Meat:
1) Brisket, Lean (1/2 lb)
2) Pulled pork sandwich
3) Chopped beef (1/2 lb)

Sides:
1) Potato salad
2) Rudy's beans
3) Cole slaw

The brisket and cole slaw were my favorite. Everything else was just okay."}
{"text":"Great food but experience was spoiled by a rude order taker who obviously didn't want to be there yet made every effort to demean me and my husband (you know who you are: I am fully knowledgable about what corn on the cob is!). Experience somewhat saved by Mitch, the manager, who couldn't have been more gracious. My husband may be back, but I have to get this experience out of my head before I decide to return."}
{"text":"For some no-frills, tasty bbq look no further. Their menu is simple and they stick to the basics. Meats are available by the half pound, and include 4 slices of bread for a 1/2 pound order. Sides include coleslaw, potato salad, creamed corn, green chile stew, new potatoes, and corn on the cob (Just to name a few!). 

I liked that they had different options for your brisket. Usually at bbq places I go to it is typically the \"lean\" brisket you get, but here at Rudy's you can decide between \"moist\" (AKA fatty) brisket, lean brisket, and \"Chef's choice\" brisket (I'd imagine this to be the leftover bits of what is carved, since it's cheaper than the other options). 

As this was our first time here, the cashier gave us a sample of the lean brisket and the turkey. Both were very flavorful and moist. I'd definitely get either meat in the future. As for my actual meal, I opted for the moist brisket with a side of green chile stew. The order was made quickly.

After you pay, there is a station for condiments that include various peppers, onions, pickles, and packets of sauces (Ketchup, mustard, horseradish). There are also straws and napkins here. The soda fountain is stocked with Coke products, and they also offer sweet and unsweetened tea.

Seating is self serve, and we found a cozy little wooden table stocked with various hot sauces, a \"sissy\" sauce, and a regular bbq sauce. The regular bbq sauce had a nice vinegary tang, with a slight kick of spice. The \"sissy\" sauce to me tasted very similar, except not as hot spice-wise. 

The moist brisket was indeed very moist, with unctuous veins of fat running through the meat. I could taste a deep smoky flavor too. The green chile stew was excellent. It was served piping hot, with a superb savory, spicy flavor. 

Overall, a nice place to go for some good bbq. I'll definitely be coming here again to try more of their bbq meats!"}
{"text":"It's all about the brisket!

Driving thru Phoenix on another grand adventure with the Hounds from Hell¬ô and exited I-10 for gas and what do I see? The sign for Rudy's!

Knowing I was up for a long, long drive, I decided to stock the cooler. My order consisted of a pound of moist brisket, 2 regular sausage, some 'tater salad and cole slaw. The brisket was wonderful. Brisket tells you the whole story behind an BBQ place, and this was smoked to perfection. The sausage and sides rocked, by the brisket was memorable."}
{"text":"We decided to eat at Ruby's barbecue because it was the only one outside of Texas we were greeted by very nice employees the front desk was very professional helpful and great customer service we ordered everything they suggested and will deathly come back for some more facility was clean the barbecue sauce was the bomb the best sauce is the route you Sissy sauce. I had nothing but good things to say about this place only if they had rice with their meets the cream corn was very good and we will be back here next time"}
{"text":"No frills BBQ - meat was fantastic!  Staff was great, very helpful. They give you a ton of samples to try before you order, so don't forget to ask to try any of the meats or sides.  We ordered brisket sandwiches and pulled pork sandwiches.  Cream corn was too rich, and corn on the cob was soggy and soaked in butter.  Would not recommend either.  Beans were good.  BBQ sauce is also very good, and they have it at all the tables.  They don't put any on the food when you order so you can put on a little or a lot yourself."}
{"text":"Rudy's makes breakfast easy in our house! The rolled tacos have gone up in price but they still compliment hash browns and coffee famously. I went in grabbed some bbq sauce and I was off within 60 seconds! Next time I'm in for dinner I will post photos of how enormous the portions are!"}
{"text":"Rudy's is a different kind of place and let me start off by saying my new favorite BBQ place. The service is outstanding and they go above and beyond. Free samples of everything you ask for and more. The BBQ is smoked on site and really smoked, not in the oven with wood chips. I had the moist brisket sandwich and the wife had the pulled pork sandwich with the new potatoes and Rudy's beans for sides, way more than enough food since we sampled pretty much everything on the menu. Great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  The sauce tastes more like vinegar than a normal bbq sauce.  We were also disappointed that a combo plate wasn't on the menu.  Pricey - 4 rubs were almost $10 with no sides.  The moist brisket and ribs were both tender.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Rudys has the best BBQ in AZ. Love the food, atmosphere & family style tables! Perfect place for large gatherings. Even the long lines move fast! And if you like breakfast their breakfast burritos are to die for!!! And they freeze well too. Go at 10:30am & they're half off."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Right off the bat let me state that I come here to eat meat - period. I couldn't really care less about the sides, although their chocolate pudding is top notch. Rudy's brisket is the best I've ever eaten. Let that sink in ... the best I've ever eaten. Their smoked turkey is life-changing, it's so good. I usually order two meat selections and one of them is usually a hot link. So it's lean brisket and a hot link or pulled pork and a hot link, you get the idea. They have two types of BBQ \"sause\", spicy and the kind my wife likes (sissy sause). Both are good, although I'm partial to the spicy stuff. The dining area is clean, family-style seating at long tables with folding chairs or patio tables on the semi-enclosed \"patio\". There's lots of TVs showing sporting events and C&W music on the speakers (I can't stand C&W, but I'll tolerate it to eat this food). Back to the food - my wife likes their green chili stew and their peach cobbler. The stew is good, but I'm not a cobbler kind of guy. Their breakfast tacos are also really good and inexpensive. We have been eating here for years, and I eat lunch here 2-3 times a month as I work nearby. We have never had a bad experience at Rudy's. If you're thinking about going to the place across the street - don't. Just go to Rudy's. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"I don't like that you don't get a plate!. I was not impressed with that.  FYI everything is purchased separately .  I've been there 3 times now. I feel in my own opinion This is just not for me Ive been all over the Country,and eaten lots of BBQ. 

WHAT I CAN SAY IS MANY OF MY FRIENDS LIKE THIS PLACE A LOT  :o)   Maybe its just me?
Order the HALF chicken, its really good and wont break your bank.  Good place to take your kids.
( Family friendly for sure! :O)"}
{"text":"OK - I am a fan of Rudy's.  I was originally introduced to Rudy's in Albuquerque.  Whenever I go to Phoenix...and it is lunch time...and I have the time - I eat at Rudy's. (I keep a jug of Rudy's BBQ sauce in my refrigerator at home)

Probably some of the best moist Brisket there is on the planet!  Very casual restaurant and pretty decent prices.  Never had anything bad.

This is a must if you are in the area!!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is some of the best BBQ I've had in a long time. I feel like it's sort of a hidden treasure among BBQ places in the valley. The menu is simple and straightforward. You buy meat by weight and then there are different sides to choose from. 

Pro tip: if they have Prime Rib, GET THE PRIME RIB!!

I got Prime Rib and Beef Brisket along with corn-on-the-cob. As you can probably tell from my \"pro tip\" above, the Prime Rib was AWESOME! So juicy and full of flavor. 

Seriously, if you want really good BBQ then you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"We picked this place over the BBQ place next door because it had better reviews. Let me first say to warn everyone.....they do not have mac-n-cheese. Yes...I kid you not....this a BBQ restaurant without Mac n cheese. Not a good start. Anyway, I'll get this over with quick. Pulled pork was good, the BBQ sauces were terrible. Pork ribs were very chewy and just disappointing. Ugh why can't I find a good BBQ joint near my home!"}
{"text":"Never been to Texas for some legit BBQ, but Rudy's at least lives up to what I think good Texas BBQ should be.

Meat is sold by the pound. Brisket, turkey, chicken, sausage, beans etc. you do have a choice of getting the meat sandwiches too. On the way to order, there's a fridge of some grab and go items too.

We got both the regular & jalape√±o sausage, half a pound of turkey, half a pound of lean brisket (that was my mistake...go for the moist!!!), some beans, coleslaw, and banana pudding.

When you order, they put all your items in the crate like carton. No fuss, no muss.

To the right of the order counter, they have the condiment, utensils, & napkins setup as well as fountain drink setup plus, of course, sweet tea and unsweetened tea.

Once you get your food & drinks, pick a table and dig in! On the table there are different sauces like the sissy sauce and the original sauce. Both were good but I found the flavor of the BBQ sauce to be a little different from what I'm used to. Did it stop me fr eating it? Nope!

All the food had great flavor. Nothing was bad or mediocre. I especially enjoyed the jalape√±o sausage. Would do that again. Back to the brisket....I don't like chunks of fat. I just don't. And being a first time here, I figured the safe bet was to go lean. Naturally, it wasn't as juicy and moist as I'd hope for but it didn't lack in flavor at all. I saw other folks \"moist\" brisket and I'll definitely do that next time!!

Rudy's is a favorite around here. So keep in mind it does and will get crowded depending on when you come!"}
{"text":"The meat is cooked very well... it is really good.  The sauce is not good at all.  I am originally from the Memphis area, and I honestly do not like any of their sauces."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've never had BBQ served this way. By which I mean, sold by the pound, given to you on a piece of paper and family style seating. I'm also not a huge BBQ fan and I live in CA,  the largest melting pot of food along with the best fish taco nation ever so this is all foreign to me. While we have a ton of BBQ joints, it's never been my first choice.

 I was visiting AZ and went here with a girlfriend of mine who is from TX. While she had been to this chain in TX, she states it's just average...I thought it was amazing :)

The concept and service was awesome. They let you sample everything and don't push you along like cattle. I ended up getting smoked turkey...holy cow it was good! As a side I got the three bean salad, I liked it, nothing special but three bean salad isn't really special. The condiment area had a ton of options too. I do wish they had more BBQ sauces (they only have two) but the ones they do have are good. 

The line was long but no biggie, it gave me time to build my beer bucket from the metal troughs full of bottled beer, soda and ice...loved this fun touch. Place is affordable too. I'll be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"First time here and their cream corn is to die for!!!! I love cream corn and they made it just perfect!!!! Too bad California don't have it here or else I would be in big trouble!!! Their ribs, turkey, and other meat which I can't think of is all
Really good!!!! I love the turkey w the cream corn makes me feel like it's the holiday when eating it!!! I love that they give u the sauce on the side so u can control the amount of sauce u put on ur ribs and such!!! I will be back when I'm in town!!! And also they let u try their wide variety of
Meats if u are curious what it taste like!!!"}
{"text":"We love good barbecue.  After living in Texas for many years and then being able to travel back for some of the great barbecue Texas is known for, we love to sample Texas BBQ restaurants located elsewhere.  

We noticed two fairly new barbecue restaurants across the street from each other on Chandler Blvd.  Now what's that all about?  Who would build a restaurant next to a competitor?  Well, evidently  Rudy's BBQ  and Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ did.  I wonder who was first??

It was an eeny, meeny, miny, moe picking which one to go to.  We ended up going to Rudy's.  I read the reviews.  I know lots of folks love Rudy's.  After our first trip there, I've got to say that we couldn't understand why. However, the brisket was very good and tender so it really does deserve the three stars but I've had better.   If I were just comparing Rudy's to the other barbecue restaurants we have eaten at, it would be at the bottom of the list.  

The rating is for the restaurant and the experience as a whole which drags it down to a two star.  Everything you order is ala carte.  If you order meat, you get only meat.  We didn't like the barbecue sauce and we didn't care for the spicy beans.  I was raised on pinto beans and cornbread.  I didn't expect spicy beans.  I wish we had tried the cream corn but only read about it when I got ready to write this review.

One more thing I didn't care about was the way the food was served.  It was served in a crate like tray with an edge all around.  Eating it was awkward but it kept the table clean.  Actually, that was a good thing because there are several signs around the restaurant telling you that your mother doesn't work there so pick up after yourself.  Now I know we all do that at fast food restaurants but at a barbecue place?

Nope.  We won't be going back.  Next time we're in the area we'll go across the street and try out the Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ restaurant.  I did walk through it and it definitely looks a \"cut\" above Rudy's .... but the review has to wait for the taste test.

In the meantime if we're in the mood for good barbecue we'll probably make a trip over to Gilbert for the fabulous Joe's BBQ or even a stop at Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"This place sucked when it first opened. I think the smokers weren't seasoned yet. This place is a lot better today though. They have some pretty good breakfast tacos and their smoked food has gotten a lot better ( not as good as the ones in San Antonio)! The brisket is awesome and the turkey is pretty good too.

I just wish the prices for what you get we're better. Their beers are way over priced too for this kind of establishment. Could be better but definitely not bad!"}
{"text":"This place is great, we lived in Chandler for a while and always drove past it... glad we finally stopped.  Fun atmosphere where you order and pay first (and grab some samples!). Don't be afraid to try different things.  We commonly do a carry out of a pound of pulled pork, under $10 makes a great quick dinner for my wife and me!!   Don't forget the sausage links!!"}
{"text":"We first experienced Rudy's when driving through New Mexico and were so very excited when they came to Chandler.  This location has held up to our expectations with great food, good service, and a consistently clean dining area.  I do wish there were just a bit more room between tables, but otherwise no complaints.  This is a great option when you want some good BBQ and a casual environment."}
{"text":"This restaurant is top of our list now.  The service is fast and very helpful.  If you are a first time customer, they give you a small sample of the meat to try before you order. Then you will find they have the best, moist brisket in Arizona! Put this on your list when you want great Texas style BarBQue"}
{"text":"Rudy's is definitely a solid choice to curb those BBQ cravings and while they don't serve up the greatest BBQ I've ever tasted, they definitely get the job done here (and then some).  What really eats the cake here is how they treat new customers.  If it's your first time, they give you the deluxe treatment with a generous assortment of samples.

This is why every time I go here, it's in fact my first time eating here.

Anyway, I've sampled the majority of their meats and this is without a doubt my favorite combo:

Chopped sausage sandwich + cutter's choice brisket + raw onions + new potatoes (throw on some of that butter) + peppers + bbq sauce = I'd rather be Helen Keller than lose my sense of taste."}
{"text":"Every meal I have had in many of thier locations has always been the best. Enjoy the atmosphere and the loaded smoked baked potato with your choice of meats is truly enjoyable."}
{"text":"Simple, great BBQ. Great prices. Friendly staff. Great for a family. We loved it. Had the pulled pork and lean brisket. 1/2 pound each was perfect for the 2 of us. We will come here again when we are in town. Loved it"}
{"text":"Meat is good.  I got the beef brisket. Don't get the Beef Brisket (Juicy or however they label it). If you get the brisket juicy then you will enjoy eating huge hunks of fat. If you like that go for it, I prefer meat with my meat.  

BBQ sauces are ok, they add a unique flavor. Condiment bar is great. Load up on peppers, and pickles.  I like that they have horseradish packets. Mix that in with their BBQ sauce and slam your brisket in it for a flavor bomb.
Coleslaw is good, I got a huge order of that.

My brisket was nice, didn't have tons of fat hanging off of it, and it was tender. Just wish I had some Sweet Baby Ray's or some BBQ with flavor to enhance the plate.

BREAKFAST TACOS AND BORRITOS

If you come here for breakfast, skip the pre made tacos by the front door.  They are very soggy from sitting in the warmer. Get them made fresh at the counter.  The tacos are the bomb. Sucks that the premade tacos are mushy like a wet load of bread."}
{"text":"While i was staying in Scottsdale i decided to give Ridy's BBq a try...so i was a first timer to this place and didnt know what to expect...but this place is great with the person taking our order knowing this was my first time...started giving me samples and suggesting the moist brisket. The meats have a great Texas smoke flavoring and bark also great tasting sides to order. I definitely  suggest you try this place...i will be back for some more great bbq"}
{"text":"Best bbq place in AZ. Buy meat buy the pound! Their turkey was really good. The moist brisket and ribs were awesome. And cream corn... good lord!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Rudy's to do take out for dinner. I walked in not knowing the terrain was greeted by some young man who quickly pointed me in the right direction. After looking over the menu, I quickly decided I was only going to purchase the smoke meat products and make my own sides. Sides add up $$. The cashier was extremely helpful in telling me how much I should order for my party of 4. I ordered 3 lbs. of Pulled Pork, 1 lbs. Baby Back Ribs, 1/2 lbs. Moist Brisket. She had also given me a generous amount of sauce. I also loved all the goodies at the side bar, hot Cherry Peppers, Jalapenos, Onions, Pickles, Bread, forks knifes and extra sauces etc. They even supply little baggies to put them in to take out. So my bill for just that amount of meat was $44.00. Now Everyone knows meat is heavy so price per pound amount is not cheap.

I will say it was pretty good, could be a little more smokier tasting though. With all the BBQ places in town there is a lot of competition. Would I go back? Yes to do take meat if I was in a pinch for that smoky flavor that they need to kick-up a bit."}
{"text":"Easy, quick and delicious. I was in Phoenix early this morning and I was finally able to go to Rudy's for their breakfast tacos. I was not disappointed. My son and I got brisket, bacon and sausage. The brisket was our favorite by far but all were wonderful. What a great deal at $1.95....it can't be beat. Wish we had a Rudy's in Tucson."}
{"text":"What is there not to LOVE about this Texas BBQ.  First off, it is not misleading as it feels like a country store from when you first walk in.  

One of the best things about this place are the bbq smokers right behind the registers.  You can watch them pull out the meats and cut it right there.   Then they serve it by the 1/2lb. And will serve your BBQ on top of butcher paper.  No fancy plates or bells and whistles.  They know their BBQ will speak for itself. 

Seating is almost picnic style as there are just different picnic tables and chairs through out.  

Service is always outstanding and prices are more than reasonable.  Definitely recommend coming here if your in the area and even worth the drive if your not.  Also if they haven't sold out of Prime Rib definitely get some as it's one of the best around!!"}
{"text":"When you smoke food at home you often go to places and critique theirs vs yours. Difference is I am smoking 2-3 cuts of meat for the weekend and they 2-3 hundred cuts. With that said Rudys brisket and turkey are some of the best around. The Chandler Az location is just as good as San Antonio and Austin TX. They are all corporate owned- not franchised."}
{"text":"Driving from TX to NM with hubby and our pup Lou.  We got hungry but could not find a place to eat since we have a doggy in the car and we could not leave him alone in there. Came across Rudy's along I10 then decided to give it a try. It is not a fast food chain so we pulled in. My hubby ran in to get food while I stayed in the car with Lou. He came back with beef brisket, 2 kinds of sauces, slaw, sweet cherry pepper and 2 coca cola.  We sat in the car and ate our lunch. It was really good! The meat was sold by the pound. I had a sandwich with warm toasted buns. Hubby had just meat since he can not eat bread. The meat was lean, tender, and flavorful! The sauces, original and sissy, were nice compliments. Slaw was home made and yummy. I didnot know Rudy's is also in Chandler, Az. We will surely visit it there once we get back."}
{"text":"My husband and I loveeee this place! Everything is so yummy! Even their chicken is so good! My favorite is the moist brisket. My husband loves their pulled pork on top of baked potato. My only wish is that they serve rice as a side. I usually just take it to go and eat it at home with a side of rice.  I love how they have a table of all the condiments, onion, peppers, etc. They also provide free bread. Their sweet tea is so good!"}
{"text":"Still really delicious!!! There are plenty of reviews to tell you why, including some of my previous ones. But just stopping by to give another happy shout out to this great BBQ place."}
{"text":"I read this place could get busy so I stopped by on Sat afternoon and got carryout with only a short line.  we ordered 1 lb of baby back ribs ($15/lb) and 1/2 lb of brisket ($16/lb), which comes in choice of moist or lean.   we ordered moist but I tried the lean (they offered samples at the counter) and would prob get that next time, less fatty but not dry.  loved the green chili stew, with it's mild spice and smokey flavor!  cole slaw was ok but the bbq sauce is kinda tart, must have a good amount of vinegar. surprised they didn't have cornbread but there's free bread at the fixings table - grabbed some bread and jalapenos.  I'd go again to try the smoked turkey and maybe sausages."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rudy's!!! I find myself craving this bbq and their AMAZING banana pudding!!!! They definitely earn five stars!!! I highly recommend their loaded baked potato with the jalape√±o sausage!!! Mind. BLOWING!"}
{"text":"This is a cute BBQ place to get a little down and dirty!  It reminds me of a Boiling Crab or Angry Crab type of place.  You can eat with your bbq-sauce-covered hands, and wash it clean at the wash station, except this is much easier to clean off without smelling like fishy hands after scrubbing for so long.  

Anyway, you go in and order from a simple menu - easy to read and not much figuring out to do.  We ordered a brisket sandwich, turkey sandwich, and 1/2 pound baby back ribs.  It is prepared and ready to go - just like that!  Then you bring it over to the picnic-like long tables where you share with fellow hungry people.  Sauces are placed on the table so you can pour it right on the table.  But first you have to go to the paper roll and rip off a piece to place on the table.  Collect your utensils and drinks at the appropriate stations.  Then chow down.  I tried the Sissy sauce because I am a sissy when it comes to hot sauces.  I also tried the BBQ sauce and enjoyed both flavors.  But tasting the smoked baby back ribs by itself without the sauce was also tasty.  You can tell that it's tender and juicy.  The taste is different from it being grilled, but just as good!"}
{"text":"Rudy's I must compare to Joe's, IMO the \"gold standard\" in BBQ.  I had the brisket, it was better than Joe's! Wife had pulled pork, also better but maybe not by much.  We shared the beans, Joe's is way, way better.  The sauce is also better at Joe's.  Joe's has a better selection of sides.  
Ambience, we like Joe's.  
Neither is close, so location may be the decider."}
{"text":"I want to give them 3.5 but now way to do that. Rudy's is a fun place to go, and as bbq joints go in AZ it is ok.   I have been twice now.  One time the line was out the door and took 35 minutes to get to the counter.  No drink service or anyone walking the line while we were waiting in that long line which surprised. me. 

First time there I got Coleslaw, the loaded potato with meat, and pork ribs.  I think the potato is the best deal in the place, it comes loaded with almost a full order of meat for the same price as an order of meat.  I had the briscuit, which was very very good.   As I have found from most bbq joints here, the coleslaw was bland, and the ribs were ok, a little overcooked.

Second time I went I had baby backs and jalapeno sausage.  Sausage was spicy and good, I am a sucker for a sausage, .  Babybacks were ok, they were pulled out of the smoker a little soon, and not falling off the bone tender.  I did have a couple of ribs on the end that got a little more heat and were decent..  it seems they do not use much spice on the ribs either and were a little bland.

Rudy's staff is friendly and the place is clean.  Because it is so new, it is not a place for a fast meal, but give it time.  It will slow down and you can drop in for a sandwich with out a 30 minute wait to order. 

Try the Briscuit and the pulled pork, I think the best things on the menu.  

Great place for the family to go and eat.  Have a good time."}
{"text":"We stopped for a late lunch as we breezed through the area on our way to New Mexico. Rudy's was exactly what we needed. Dining is very casual-at picnic tables and you stand in line to order. The meat is sold in minimums of 1/2 lb., but sandwiches are also on the menu. The moist brisket was excellent!  Generous portions.  Very helpful and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm very familiar with Rudy's, as it was a staple BBQ spot in NM (where in originally from). Just as it was back home, Rudy's continues to offer delicious BBQ at a great price. 

I'm a sucker for their brisket (usually dealer's choice between moist, a bit fattier, and lean, less fat), and the jalape√±o sausage. The brisket is never dry and seasoned/smoked to perfection, and the sausage has just the right amount of spiciness. They also have ribs and pulled pork, plus the chicken is also fantastic, if red meat isn't your thing. 

Sides like the potato salad and cream corn are wonderful compliments to your meal, but go with the jumbo baked potato if you're feeling famished - it's fit for a giant. You can even add any meat if your choice and make a meal of it on its own. 

Rudy's offers ample indoor and outdoor (enclosed patio) seating, and is a great breakfast/lunch/dinner spot for your whole family. Wait..breakfast you say?? Yea, Rudy's also has breakfast tacos that are AMAZING! In case you miss out on getting them in the AM, sometimes you get lucky and they still have a few when you go for lunch. #Winning"}
{"text":"Worst bbq I've ever had. Food was cold Ribbs were tough will never go back. When  you spend that much money you want your food to be hot"}
{"text":"First visit will be the last visit. Ordered a brisket sandwich. The beef was so dry it was inedible. I had no time to return it. I am not the BBQ eater where I use a lot of sauce as it then covers up the fakir of the meat. Doing so would be Ike why even bother taking the time to slow smoke the meat in the first place. I actually choked on this it was like leather. It alone was way over salted for my taste. 

Even if I was able to return this meat it should never made it to my plate like that. That plate is a signature dish and should never be prepared and served like this in my opinion. 

Great atmospheric and comfortable environment. Wish there was a manager on duty that asked me how the food was. Just a bunch of kids last Saturday at 5PM. 

If I could I would have given this 0 stars as my sandwich and coleslaw and water was over $10 and was near inedible. 

Lots of BBQ choices one right next door! 

You guys need to get your quality control in order and make sure your manager is more proactive with the customers!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had heard very good things about Rudy's bbq and on 3/3/18 we decided to come dine in for lunch after our long tiresome drive from Tucson. We ordered the lean brisket, baby back ribs, potato salad, beans, sweet tea and peach cobbler. Unfortunately our experience was quite contrary to the wonderful  \"word of mouth\" recommendations.  Our hot food was cold and flavor less. No salt or pepper on any of the meats. The sides tasted unauthentic. The cobbler was just \"okay\".  We did not enjoy our lunch on that day and most likely will not return.  The best thing from eating here was the gentlemen who greeted us & informed us how to order our food. Sorry, but from our negative experience we can't recommend Rudy's BBQ Chandler location."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time,  BBQ sauce is water with pepper sauce, Ribs have no smoke flavor at all and were not the fall off the bone type.. they had a bit of pull to them, Moist brisket was moist, but again, no smoke flavor, corn was mushy, baked beans taste like Campbell's with BBQ sauce added to them, potato salad is bland. I'll go to Tom's or Joe's until I come on to something better."}
{"text":"Rudy's bbq is a solid option for nice, Smokey meat.  The menu is basic, beef, chicken or pork, with a few sub varieties.   Sides include creamed corn, beans, coleslaw, and peach cobbler for dessert.  Texas style bar b q.  A nice sauce is available on be tables, and a \"sissy\" sauce is readily available if you don't lean toward spicy.  My favorite is the jalape√±o sausage."}
{"text":"You cannot beat this place for the price! The moist brisket is phenomenal and for 6.99 per 1/2 lb you can't beat it. Cream corn is great too! I've been to other bbq places in the valley which didn't taste as good and we're double the price. Do yourself a favor and come here."}
{"text":"If you mention that is your first time, they pull fresh meat of the grill.  We stopped here because Brazilian bull was closed due to non payment of rent. we still wanted to eat meat. ..as we were driving around,  yelp told us of this nearby location.  The staff was friendly,  explained all the different choices for us,  and was very casual.  We will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Quick service, helpful staff, reasonable sides and entrees, but the bbq sauce is too vinegary and spicy.  Leaves an aftertaste which is unpleasant.  Everything else is very good.  Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the brisket and turkey. The sides are really good too the beans and macaroni salad. Not to mention all the cold bottled sodas and beer. Also try their breakfast burritos this place has it all."}
{"text":"You can tell they don't have any passion for the meat here.  And that's a problem, because BBQ is difficult to cook well without passion.

The brisket: I've been to this location three times. Once the brisket was ok, sort of tender, I actually enjoyed it. Twice the brisket was dry and tough. Really tough, like there is no mistaking this Brisket for tender. Like obviously the cook doesn't care. Also, on my most recent trip I asked for the bark to be left on. They just flipped it upside down and gave it to me with the top lopped off anyway. 

Sausage: good enough.

This place isn't horrible. It's ok. I just wish they'd put a little more soul behind the BBQ. BBQ is expensive. It would be nice if they tried to make it worth it to spend the money at Rudys."}
{"text":"The turkey is delicious as per usual. Staff are all friendly. Nothing compares to Rudy's smoked flavor."}
{"text":"Pleased and Displeased all in one... I ordered a sausage sandwich and got home to find out there wasn't any bread . \"Sandwich No Bread\" 4.99 just for sliced sausage isn't what I was expecting but the banana pudding & brownie was delicious."}
{"text":"I've never met a prime rib I didn't like; tonight I met a moist brisket that put prime rib to shame.  

The beans were great, as was the green chili stew ~ yum!  The cole slaw & potato salad were impressive as well!

Next time we'll get it to go & share with the kiddos!"}
{"text":"All I've heard from Albuquerque friends was how great this place is.  They all couldn't wait for this place to open.

So far my favorite is the turkey and I'm not a bird fan at all.  For the most part I go out of my way to eat any chicken or turkey outside of home because I'm always disappointed with how dry it is.  This is NOT dry and very flavorful.

I've tried the pork ribs and the baby back ribs and like both.  I didn't even need to add sauce for the flavor they are rubbed with is plenty.

They have cream corn here and although in reality I know this is really only gravy with some corn I'm in love.  This version is very very very good.

I am not, however, impressed with the brisket.  Although flavorful it is very dry.  Not worth it to me."}
{"text":"I've had this on my list of places to try for a while now, and since I'm in this part of town for the next few days, I wanted to stop and try it out.  I came here for lunch today, and had a really good time.

Pulling in, I decided to do lunch instead of dinner because I figured it would be a lighter crowd, and to some degree it was. I mean, it wasn't packed, thank goodness, but people were coming in like crazy!  Quite impressive at the heavy flow of traffic for a Saturday lunch hour.

I came in and asked the girl at the front how it works here.  She went through how I stand in line, and place my order at the counter and they make the food while I order.  There's also a HUGE selection of cold beer as you walk through line that's on ice, along with a great selection of cold side items to go with whatever you eat.

I took my time ordering at the register, and felt really comfortable taking my time.  No rush or pressure to \"hurry up\" and I had a lot of questions about their menu.  They had 3 different types of brisket, and I asked what the difference was between all three.  The girl told me that one was lean, one was not, and I forget what the third one was.  You can go with a half pounder type meal, or a smaller sandwich which is what I had wanted.  I went with the Moist Brisket, creamed corn, and a medium drink.  Total bill was just 9 and change.

I got my food and went to take a seat. Everything here is picnic table style, so your going to end up sitting next to strangers, which I'm fine with.  They have BBQ sauce, hot sauce and one or two other items at each end of the picnic tables. If your stuck in the middle, I don't know how you would get the BBQ sauce if its clear at the other end.  The Brisket itself was AWESOME! Most, tender and definitely awesome! I totally loved how it tasted, and everything was just right.

They also have a HUGE hand washing station for when your done eating.  Why do I love this?  First, BBQ is messy! You get your hands kinda gross from the sauce and who wants to go into the bathroom just to wash your hands? They have 4 or 5 different nozzles and the water is nice and warm..soap and towels to! right there out in the open!  I love it.

Here's why I deducted a star. It's going to sound SO DUMB but I think you'll get it. First, there wasn't really any BBQ sauce on the sandwich itself. That's fine because the meat tasted perfect without it.   Normally, at other BBQ places, there's a selection of a few different sauces to choose from if you want to dress your meat with sauce. Rudy's only had 2.  Regular and spicy.  Okay, I'll take that. 

Here's the catch. The sauce is IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the container! They have this weird nozzle on the sauce container and you must use both hands to get it out...including pounding on the bottom of the bottle and turning it 100% bottoms up!  I know what your thinking...the bottle must be empty, right? NO ITS 100% FULL.  I got so irritated with it, that I just stopped putting sauce on! I want more sauce! Why does it have to be a major project?   Eveyrtime I tried to sauce my sandwich, it became a huge bottle beating project!  Basically, they need better nozzles that let more sauce out so I don't have to break the dam thing to put it on my sandwich! argh!!!!!

Overall, I would 100% recommend this place! GO EAT HERE.  Definitely worth the drive!  They even have a little store in the front where you can buy stuff like BBQ sauce and other stuff for your home too!"}
{"text":"Great cheap breakfast tacos. The brisket is delicious. Casual setting country atmosphere. Fast food and quality mixed."}
{"text":"Our first time at this location. The food was amazing as always!! Ordered the moist brisket and some corn on the cob. Also ordered the potatoes and a prime rib. Love the BBQ from here. 

Staff at this location was not as friend as the one in Texas. Not sure if they were having an off day or what. But the food gets a 10 star and the staff gets a 0. Really though they seemed annoyed by us. Good thing the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Ala-carte BBQ... brisket, chicken, pulled pork... the norm. The process of ordering was a little different from what I am used to back in South Carolina, but end result was some solid BBQ. Coleslaw was a pleasant surprise, I am typically quite particular about my slaw, it was tasty. 

Long tables easily accommodate large crowds, but get in early before the crowd does or you might have to wander around. 

Just off of I-10 and on Litchfield, it is very convenient to get in and out in a hurry."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Rudy's in TX and was very happy to have them right here in Chandler and provide a little competition for my always delicious Honey Bears.  They do very well in comparison.  Their quality of meat is incredicle, much better than HBs, and the fact they let you sample the different types is great.  The BBQ sauce is very good as well.  I do prefer the memphis style BBQ sauce of Honey Bears but Rudy's is still very good as an alternative.  The beans and the potato salad are the only two sides I have tried thus far.  Both of them were very good.

My only complaint is the lack of fries or mac and cheese.  I am not sure what the reasoning is for not having these items.  I am sure they would do a great job on them based on everything else they have.

I've had breakfast here once and was impressed.  I will be back again for that.  Brisket, eggs and bbq sauce go very well together."}
{"text":"I was in town to watch the Red's Spring Training and my friend took me to Rudy's.   I consider myself a BBQ nerd and I must say that my experience here was nothing short of amazing.  It was great food, great price and an even better atmosphere."}
{"text":"The best BBQ. If we went leaving town tomorrow, I would eat there again. I had a loaded baked potato filled with 1/2 pound of the most delicious beef brisket. Yummy."}
{"text":"A barbaque bonanza visually apealing great smells. The lack of paper plates to say the least every thing is placed on a sheet of paper.  Why?
 Drinks are placed in tubs of ice very cool. Picnic benches everywhere.
Windows to the outside open like garage doors.
  Prices were Very resonable it is all ala cart.
The selection of barbque sauce is limited. To 2 types bitter and spicy no sweet sauce. 
  The meat no matter how much sauce you put on is saturated with the smoker that the meat is cooked in.
 The corn on the cob was awesome and sweet.
  I understand the picnic type setting. But service lacks or is non existant in the eating area .

A sign desplayed kinda kiddingly does descibe the attitude here.  Staff taking orders at the grill great and gift shop are very good and exceptional"}
{"text":"We always enjoy Rudy's- the customer service is outstanding and the food is wonderful! This week I came and ordered to go- They wrapped everything well and it stayed warm until I was home and ready to serve. We first went to Rudys in Waco, TX and were pleased to see when we moved to AZ that we would be close to one to enjoy often!"}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with the smoked turkey baked potato! The turkey was full of flavor and moisture. I tasted the bbq sauce (original and sissy) and both were very peppery, which I didn't like. My vote is 4.5 because because they handle money and the food with no gloves but our order was very good nonetheless."}
{"text":"I was sooo happy when they put a Rudy's in Phoenix. Move here 10 years ago from Texas and could not find good BBQ in the state. 

A bit of a drive but, well worth the trip. The manager said more Rudy's BBQ restaurants will open in the valley soon. Hopping for some the close. Too hot during the Phoenix summer to grille outside during the day."}
{"text":"Great experience and food. Brisket is outstanding with a strong smokey flavor. Green chile stew has a nice spicy kick that does not disappoint. 

Lots of open seating with Rudy's brand of sauce right at the table, choose between spicy or sissy. While the wait to order was about 5 minutes, the quality customer service definitely stands out."}
{"text":"This place sets a new standard for mediocrity.  Felt like I was sitting in a dirty barn.
I do have to say, the brisket was good, but that's as far as it goes.  The cole slaw was bland, the pork was fair and the corn on the cob was water-logged.  Could have rung it out like a sponge.  We were afraid to touch the bottles of barbeque sauce that were on the table...encrusted with food.   Hard to believe that this place got good reviews...no accounting for good taste, I guess."}
{"text":"Smokey and delicious and a ton of \"fixins\" to go with it.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I had so far in the valley. The moist brisket is the best, the turkey is not very special. Can't wait to try the chicken too.
If only they would do beef ribs too!!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times.  I love their food. They give you all the free samples of their food to make sure you want it before you buy it.  
The Sauce is very good.  They let you take all the sides you need. 
Try the creamed corn.  Drool...now I want some!!

It's never been anything but clean when we've gone in and eaten.  Can take a while to get through the line on the busy days but it's worth the wait. 

Two different sauces..One for the kids (Sissy!) and one for the adults."}
{"text":"Such a great bbq place that our friend recommended! We were visiting from Los Angeles and we definitely don't have anything like Rudy's at home. The line moved pretty quickly and the staff was very nice and patient with all of our questions. They brought us samples to try before we ordered and everything was delicious. I don't eat red meat so I can't speak for that but the turkey was amazing and the sausage too. I ended up ordering the pulled pork sandwich and it was probably the best I've ever had! So much flavor. And my favorite side dish was the creamed corn. Great place wish we had one in LA!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying, I'm typically not a fan of BBQ. So, I don't have crazy expectations or am a fan of this kind versus some other kind. 

The way Rudy's works is that you stand in line, wind around the drinks, turn on the refrigerated goods (potato salad, three bean salad) and end up at the registers where they weigh out the different foods. 

The jalape√±o sausage is amazing. It's probably my favorite offering. And the rest of the meat is pretty good too. We usually get the sausage and some brisket. 

You then take your food, hit up the condiment bar where there are peppers and onions and the like, and find a seat on one of the picnic benches. They keep their bbq sauce on the table and I usually don't even touch it. The meat is too good to ruin with sauce. 

Make sure to clean up your area when you're done and they do have some ziploc bags up at the condiment area if you manage to preserve any leftovers."}
{"text":"Nothing more fabulous than stopping for some awesome bbq on my way back to Yuma!  This time I got Prime Rib, Moist Brisket, Sausages, and Ribs.  Gotta have the bbq sauce though as it is the bomb!  Have to say used to live next to the original in San Antonio and you can't go wrong with Rudy's!"}
{"text":"I am a little late posting this review as we ate here last month for my husbands birthday but I had to leave a review!

Amazing. To sum it up...it is amazing. It was a bit of a drive for us but well worth it. We loved everything about this place. I had the sausage which was perfection and my husband had the brisket. (He even went back to get more lol) They even were able to give us a small portion of meat for my daughter. The potato salad is great and I love the inside set up. It's like a big picnic. 

When we are up for the drive again we will be back for sure. Best BBQ I have had here in AZ so far."}
{"text":"The best!!!!!  Worth the drive from
Phoenix!!  Meat heaven.  Nice employees.  The beef brisket is a solid A!!!  Little Miss' brisket is A+, but Rudy's is pretty close actually!

I'll be back:)"}
{"text":"I ordered 1/2lb of the moist brisket and 1/2lb of the smoked turkey.  Both items burned the mouth with fuel taste...not pleasing, and in fact, we tossed both in the garbage, wouldn't have fed it to my dog!  I called the manager about it (since it was takeout) he told me \"that's impossible, we don't use fuel\".  Really!!!  I told him to go taste it.  I would never go here again, nor would I suggest anyone else."}
{"text":"My brother adores Rudy's brisket. He used to work in Chandler and would stop in frequently. Now he lives near Tucson and whenever he comes up north wants to meet at Rudy's for lunch or dinner. I've been several times with him, other family and friends. Definitely a favorite with the men in the party and big meat eaters. The smoked meats here are really good. The turkey is a little heavy on black pepper, but I still love it.

I first got turned onto the franchise by going to the original restaurant in Albuquerque (they even smoke trout there).

Unfortunately one time at the Chandler location I got the pulled pork sandwich and bit into not 1 but 2 big globs of fat. Eeewe! Now I know pork shoulder has a lot of fat because I make it myself. However they put the sandwich together right there and could see it when they made it. I eat meat, not fat sandwiches! I've been back since but now I stick with the chicken or turkey so I can see what I'm eating and not have it cloaked under a bun.

 In the morning they have inexpensive Tex Mex/Cowboy breakfast tacos and burritos. Those of you that need gluten free can request the ingredients in a bowl. Their beans are delicious with eggs, potatoes and cheese! You can customize yours from a list of ingredients. Sometimes after Easter they include ham as one of the picks. Yumm!"}
{"text":"I have yet to step foot in this place, however I don't need to in order to rate it. 

A friend of mine said, \"I am coming up from Tucson and Rudy's is on the way to your house I am bringing breakfast.\" OK, well I'm game for anything. 

He brought the breakfast tacos. First its more like a breakfast burrito its big for a taco. Secondly, it was utterly amazing. Apparently they take the left over brisket and trimmings from the night before, marinate it in BBQ sauce and BAM that's the breakfast taco ingredients. I have been craving another one ever since Friday morning when I had mine.

I cannot wait to go try Rudy's for dinner. I have tried Bobby Q's, Famous Daves, Dickey's, and Brian's up in Cave Creek, this was BY FAR the best I have had in the valley!! 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in San Antonio and the Rudys there I was very disappointed in this store. Meat was dry and over cooked. I can't believe how bad this was. Rudys has always been my favorite but not in Arizona."}
{"text":"Giving three stars because the piece of prime rib I had was cooked perfect. Everything else I'm kinda like what the heck?? Had some new potatoes which are red potatoes boiled in salt water very basic. If you like meats like you would get at a great picnic our backyard Q then this place is great. I'm just not really into eating my prime rib with a plastic fork and breaking my fork three times. Cutting prime with a plastic knife is very different as well. To go with that nothing like juicy prime rib on a piece of butcher paper and not a plate so it runs all over the place. Thank heaven for level tables. I also thought I could get a cold draft but everything is in single serve bottles. Over all food was decent but I probably won't be back. It really felt like an over priced picnic!"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends, lots of fun! You order at the counter, price is by the 1/2 lb usually and they weight it in front of you. You can even get samples if you are not sure what to get.
I got 1/2 lb moist brisket with a small potato salad and it was enough for two meals! 
The meat was delicious, smokey and juicy. I also tried the stew which was good! Don't forget to try their bbq sauce! Absolute must.

You get to put paper on your table and eat without plates which is a fun experience. 
Plenty of tables for everyone. 

Don't forget this place does A LOT of bbq so do not be surprised if your hair and clothes smell of bbq at the end of the meal :)  (worth it)"}
{"text":"Mmmm, Bout' time Famous Dave's ain't cuttin' it!!!"}
{"text":"Beef brisket moist is a must & I highly recommend. The taste is in the meat not the sauce. Excellent service with such wonderful staffing. All this place needs is a gas station just like in Texas!"}
{"text":"I've been to Rudy's in Austin TX before and wanted to try this place. This place is a lot nicer than the Austin one. When we first walked in they were very friendly, helpful and patient. You order your food by the pound and then find a picnic table and enjoy. 
We ordered the extra moist brisket with a half a loaf of white bread, baby back ribs, sweet corn and potato salad. The brisket was the best and nice juicy ribs. The meat doesn't come with any bbq sauce cause it's really good without the sauce I tried the sissy sauce and that was good with the brisket. Oh my gosh so good. The sweet corn is so good. I just love the BBQ here. I just wish they would open one in the north east area. Will I be back? You bet."}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat a lot of meat. This place serves a lot of meat. The lean brisket is good. Gotta get the pickles. I also really enjoy the pulled pork and turkey. Not a fan of the sausage though. Spicy bbq sauce for the win!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat, very helpful and friendly staff, great food, cool atmosphere 5 thumbs up, visited from Los Angeles for spring training for the Dodgers, last stop before heading back home!! Loved it"}
{"text":"Visited here from Miami, FL and was expecting a wholesome, belly-rubbing, itis-catching meal from the reviews I read. However, that was sadly not the case. 
I loved the drink set up. You grab a bucket and can choose from sodas/juices to a wide range of beers. The food is served by 1/2 lb and includes choices such as brisket, moist brisket, pulled pork, sausage, etc. I chose the brisket with burnt ends and was not very pleased with what I received. I'm hoping it's because I arrived an hour prior to closing that I was so dissatisfied, but the brisket definitely lacked flavor. On a brighter note, the cream corn is SO DELICIOUS! I wish I would've ordered more of that! And Rudy's beans were just eh.
The girl who attended us didn't seem happy to be there and had a bit of an attitude. Always a huge negative for me. Overall, this is not a place I would go out of my way to come back to."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas.  I'm not Arizona's biggest fan and I hope not to remain here for the rest of my life.  Every time I think I'm getting out of here, something happens and I get stuck.  Eventually, I'll escape this hell and make it back home.  
I miss everything about Texas.  The friendly people, the trees, grass in front yard, tubing on a river that actually moves, breakfast tacos, and barbeque.  Thank God, two of those things are here now!
I had stumbled onto Texas BBQ House and I admit, I loved it, but it's in a sketchy part of town that I'd rather not go to.  (And there's something wrong about eating barbeque out of crates in Scottsdale.)  At one point, my boyfriend and I actually contemplated making the 6 hour drive to El Paso to get some Rudy's.  Luckily, the next weekend a friend told us they were building a Rudy's!  Close to our house!  Down the street from where I was currently working!  
I think it was maybe 2 days after it opened before we finally made it down there and it was EXACTLY like walking into Rudy's that's 10 minutes away from my parent's house.  There's country music playing and Blue Bell ice cream and tubs full of every kind of Shiner you could ask for.  It felt like home.  Every time I go, I'm simultaneously elated to feel like I'm back in Texas and depressed to know I'm not.  
Everything on the menu is amazing.  I'm a big fan of lean brisket and jalapeno sausage, but seriously, there's nothing on that menu I won't eat.  I always get one of the big tubs of potato salad and that chocolate pudding will change your life. 
And, if you go in the morning, there's breakfast tacos!  This is the only place in Arizona that seems to know what a breakfast taco is and serves them!  It's a travesty that we live in a state with flour tortillas, but they refuse to make breakfast tacos or even figure out what they are!  
As for the reviewer complaining about the crates and deli paper and *gasp* having to refill their own drink!  This is Rudy's Texas style barbeque.  We're friendly folk and we don't mind sharing a table with strangers.  Texans will just strike up a conversation with the people next to them, or in line with them, or hell, a phone call placed to the wrong number.  If you don't like it, go next door to the unlucky folk who happened to open a barbeque place next door to this gem.   And how can a place that's been open 24 years and opens a new location that looks exactly the same as all of their others be copying a place that opened maybe a year ago?  I do believe Texas BBQ House is copying Rudy's, not the other way around.  Get it right.  
Bottom line, if you haven't tried Texas style barbeque, you need to go here.  Forget all the lame reviews from people that don't know better.  Just come and have the best meat of your life."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Their beers are reasonably priced too. Probably the best place to eat in goodyear. Much better then Dickies."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ and extremely inexpensive. I'm not sure how they stay in business with prices so low. Their breakfast burritos are also fantastic. Did I mention the low prices????"}
{"text":"Rudy's in Goodyear just opened a few weeks ago and i waited for the crowds and the newness to calm down.   The inside is very clean and organized.  We had the pulled pork and the sliced turkey and cole slaw, and i must say the meats were very tasty but very expense almost $14 a pound.  now on the other side  the coleslaw was awful. for $2.09 you get a little cup (i am guessing about 3 ounces)  it was flavorless.     over all i would not recommend this, especially for the budget minded"}
{"text":"Takes about 35 dollars to feed my fam of 3. Favorite place ever, jalapeno sausages booomb"}
{"text":"There's a lot of buzz about this place so I had to drive out to experience it. I love the atmosphere, with the meat being pulled from the pits and sliced to order. The smoke flavor is good in the meat. The loaded baked potato is huge, and the corn on the cob was cooked properly. 

So why am I giving it only 3 stars? Because despite being called Texas BBQ, their sauces and even the pulled pork without sauce had strong vinegar flavors, and I'm just not a vinegar fan - that's what I consider Carolina BBQ. It's a good BBQ joint but not to my taste preference."}
{"text":"The moist brisket here is there best thing on the menu, it is flavorful and falls apart in your mouth. The other BBQ items are good to, but nothing too fantastic. The only qualm about this place in my opinion is the BBQ sauce. I cannot take a BBQ place seriously when they have corporately packaged BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"The brisket is to die for. My husband and I make a goal of coming here every time that we're in the Goodyear area, and it's never been a disappointment. We love this place. There hasn't been a dish we've disliked yet!"}
{"text":"Interesting place. Staff is warm and friendly. You get to sample items before you purchase them. The prime rib was excellent. The jalape√±o sausage was even better. So much food I couldn't eat everything. Great for families and reasonably priced. I like the fact they weigh your meat so you know exactly how much you have. That's pretty cool."}
{"text":"I was disappointed on my last trip here.  The brisket I got was pretty much all fat.  I did email the company and surprisingly I got a response within  hours and it was on a Sunday.  They have offered to replace the brisket which I am happy with."}
{"text":"So why didn't someone tell me there is a Rudy's BBQ here in the greater Phoenix metro area? I am just a little disappointed that I have lived here for a year and I am just finding out about this location. What's up with that?

I have been a HUGE fan of Rudy's in Albuquerque, NM for years now. Even made special trips to ABQ just to go to Rudy's . . . and now I find out there is one just a couple miles from my house . . . geez! You mean I could have been eating here all along?

I was out tooling around on a Sunday afternoon thinking I was either going to have to go home or find myself a drive-thru because I was just not going to make it until dinner time . . .  when I saw the sign: **RUDY'S!**  I nearly caused a major pile-up on Chandler Blvd as I whipped my little black Honda around in traffic and scooted into the parking lot, jumped into the only empty space and went inside. I could not believe that this little bit of BBQ heaven was right here in Chandler. 

I didn't even have to look at a menu. Pulled pork sandwich, creamed corn, potato salad and a beer, please.  I found myself a small table on the patio and literately scarfed that dreamy sandwich down with occasional bites of creamed corn & potato salad and then washed it all down with an ice cold beer.

Best BBQ on the planet and now it's here within a short car ride, not a plane ride. Heaven, right here on earth . . . er, Arizona!"}
{"text":"First tried this place in Houston, glad that they have one here in Phoenix now. Really good brisket and ribs."}
{"text":"Moist brisket is my favorite followed by ribs. Sweet corn I love. A sweet tea is always a treat. I've had everything on the menu except the prime rib and everything is always great. From Texas to Colorado, the BBQ is always great."}
{"text":"Rudy's BBQ food is yummy! I'm usually a beef brisket lover but I recommend the turkey here. Everything is quite delicious that I've tried. Not crazy about their BBQ sauce but the meats r u so juicy, u don't really need BBQ sauce"}
{"text":"My husband and I meet at Rudy's often for lunch since it is right by his work.  I always order the potato with meat on it and my husband usually orders the small sandwich.  We have tried most of the meats but the pork and turkey are our favorites!! We have always been disappointed with the sides here.  They are bland and really not that great.  When you have places like Joes Real BBQ that have phenomenal sides I guess you kind of expect that.  I would love to see some new sides in the future.  Their BBQ sauce on the other hand is delicious!! We actually buy the big bottle to have at our house :) ... You can't go wrong with eating at Rudy's!!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that they open so early!  I work medical graveyard shifts, so I eat dinner when \"normal\" people eat breakfast.  The breakfast tacos with brisket were excellent.  This was some of the best brisket I've since leaving Texas.  Even better, I had a coupon.  (If you sign up for their e-mail, you get coupons - this one was for my birthday.)  I fully plan to go back for \"dinner\" (breakfast for me LOL).  Some people think it's a bit pricey.  I can see that, but it's not like you're ordering a cheap burger at a fast food place.  Their prices are in line with other (quality) BBQ places I've been to in TX and AZ."}
{"text":"Rudy's has been one our families favorite places to eat for a few years now.  My son-in-law recommended we try it out, and the kids always are asking to go to Rudy's to eat.  The food is very good, the atmosphere is family friendly, the employees are very helpful, but I do have to say the prices are a little high.  We were glad to have them open a location on the West side, it's nice to have one closer.  Their creamed corn in amazing!  Give it a try, the food is great!"}
{"text":"Never again. Got 1lb of moist brisket. Half of it was fat.  It also tasted like gas. It was extremely smokey which I don't mind but it was imparted with the worst gas flavor. BBQ shouldn't taste this way."}
{"text":"Pulled pork is to die for. Excellent brisket and wonderful smoked turkey. Great mess hall atmosphere and the price is right!"}
{"text":"When we went it was first open and the line was INSANE! The food was excellent however it was a tad pricey. We have actually never been back due to the prices I guess and we were one of the many who were super excited to have a BBQ place open in this part of town. I am thinking we will go back soon to give it another try now that we don't see lines wrapping around the entire building so I can give a more accurate review."}
{"text":"Our first time going was  today and was blown away The turkey, brisket, and chicken were bursting with flavor and was still hot when we got to our table.  We were a bit overwhelmed at first by the menu, but the staff was quick to offer samples in order to expedite our order.  We will be back no doubt"}
{"text":"We were surprised that two BBQ places were right across the street from one another, but I have to say that Rudy's by far was better than the other, although it's nice to have choices.  

We had the platter with chicken, turkey, and brisket with a side of corn I believe and the meat was so moist but still hot.  

The staple of eating your food out of the crates is dynamite.  I don't get caught up in what I eat out of, as long as the food is good, hot, and moist.

Thank you Rudy's"}
{"text":"Amazing food at great prices. I love that they have breakfast tacos, and a big ice cooler with beer and soda in it. Such a great place to just hangout and enjoy some delicious BBQ. 
I always go with the moist brisket and some ribs. It never fails me."}
{"text":"True Texas style BBQ! As my daughter put it \"cheers to the most epic dinner ever! \"
You stand in line and order,  pick a picnic table, sit down and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"It was very crowded, so the line was loneg but plenty of seating. We both had the pulled pork sandwiches which were ok, but the creamed corn was delish!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I visit this place from California . The service the first time around was great, made me want to come back and eat here again which is why my family and I decided to make the drive back here. This time around I can't say the service was anything close to the same as our previous visit. The young lady at the register was very pleasant and helpful, however the store manager who's name I didn't get was extremely rude and unhelpful which kind of spoiled our excitement of even coming here to begin with. She seemed to be bothered at any of the questions we were asking."}
{"text":"After a long fun (but rough) night out, I dragged my feet in hoping for some comfort food and I found just that.

Cold beer, Brisket, sausage, ribs and cream corn. I was in heaven.

Their Rudy's hot sauce had me at first lick.

It was one of my \"Thank God I'm not a vegan\" moment."}
{"text":"Ribs- I'd rather eat the ribs out of a hungry man meal. The brisket- ill just do it myself rather then pay these inflated prices. And by the way, if you say the ribs are 6.49 a pound, then give me a pound or less. Not more and then charge me more. I don't see McDonalds weighing their 1/4 pounders and charging you more because it's over a  1/4 of a pound. I paid 8.49 for what the menu said was 6.49. That's BS. Give me the right amount or less. I know good BBQ and this place is sad."}
{"text":"Super friendly people work here. We were impressed with how friendly everyone was upon our first visit and they walked us to where to go and what to do. They even gave us samples of the best seller meats which was cool. Cool spot for big groups also as they have large picnic table type setup. Very good BBQ food. The baked potatoes are the best. We will definitely go back and tell others as well. BBQ can be pricey but you get great portions here and it's worth it."}
{"text":"I almost got in an accident when I saw this from the 10.  I have been a HUGE Rudys fan for years.  I don't live in AZ so when I saw this place we almost died trying to get off of the freeway for a taste of that extra moist brisket.

The brisket if the best Ive ever had in my life.  True TX BBQ.  The smoked turkey is awesome.  The jalapeno sausage is our of this world.  

My only problems is the location.  Rudy's can you open a spot 380 miles west in LA?  Thanks you !"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

OK, yeah, so Rudy's is a chain.  But it's a chain in the same way that Mastro's is a chain.  The fact that they've expanded way past San Antonio doesn't make it any less delicious.

Texas style BBQ here, specifically Hill Country, smoking with oak.  Butcher paper, meat to order by the pound, sliced white bread.  This doesn't measure up to the best BBQ in the country, but it is very good BBQ.  My three favorite meats are the moist brisket, the jalapeno sausage, and the ribs.  Everything else tastes pretty average to me, and the sauce, I can take it or leave it.  Actually, compared to some other BBQ joints, I think their sauce is pretty weak.  The spicy isn't quite spicy enough, and the mild has this almost watery aftertaste that's a little off-putting.  If they have the prime rib, it is also just OK.  I don't think I'd pay the premium for it when there's other great meat on the menu.

Their sides are better than most BBQ joints.  The creamed corn is pretty tasty, the beans are average.  I'm still undecided on the green chile - it's hearty and filling but lacks green chile.

They also have banana pudding which, if you get one that's been sitting for a while, the Nilla wafers have soaked up some of the moisture of the pudding and the flavor, the outside is a little mushy but the inside still has some crunch so when you dig into it, you get texture with the creaminess of the pudding and banana.  Granted, you can't tell by looking, but you could get lucky.

So if you don't want to wait in line for good Texas BBQ (like at Little Miss), this is the place to go.  Finally, two words - pickle bar."}
{"text":"Was staying in a hotel in the area and stumbled across Rudy's. It was my first time dining here and it was a great bbq experience. Since it was my first time, they gave be a sampling of most of the meats I was curious bout. I settled for the moist brisket, pulled pork and baby back ribs, all were delicious! The white labeled bbq sauce was great! The staff were both friendly and helpful. I visit Phoenix often and will be making Rudy's a regular dinner stop!"}
{"text":"This place is not good at all! That is not BBQ sauce! I am not sure why this place is getting 4stars! If I could give no stars I would. So disappointed. Thumbs Down get better BBQ sauces!!!"}
{"text":"This Rudy's was such a letdown.  I first went to Rudy's a year ago while on vacation in Texas.  It was the best BBQ that I ever went to.  With memories of Rudy's BBQ in my mind, I wanted to visit Rudy's before going home to California.  I should've listened to my wife and went to the Cracker Barrel.  They were set up like all the other Rudy's BBQ's where you get in line to order your food.  Condiments, drinks, and utensils were self serve.  

Their Fatty Brisket was on the drier side. The flavor of the brisket was not as good as the stuff you get in Texas.  We came here specifically for the moist flavorful brisket.  They did not deliver it to us on the day of our visit.  Both my wife and my daughter didn't like it.  

Ordinarily I would give a restaurant that lets me down like this 2 stars.  But, their dry Fatty Brisket was still better than the places that I have tried in California.  For being better than the stuff in California, I will give them an extra star."}
{"text":"Rudy's is great and is very busy business. I don't know why they coat their meat in hydrogenated oil that's in the spices thats on everything. Manger said it's exactly what they sell up front, it says hydrogenated oil. I wish they used better quality. It's the ingredient most places stopped using and what most package food says these days \"no hydrogenated oil\". Causing clogged arteries and heart disease. It's a barbaric thing to put in food. I bought meat today and brought home before I knew this, I won't be eating it"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in Arizona!  Their jalape√±o smoked sausage is delicious. Their brisket is moist and it has a lot of flavor. 

They make delicious breakfast tocos. 
I wish they used a corn tortilla instead of a flour tortilla.  Looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"I came here expecting for an adventure or run into fellow Yelp reviewer, Melody C.  You see, with her grandiose expectations of this barbeque chain to be on par of her regular dining experiences along the upper echeleons of Scottsdale or Paradise Valley; I had to see this to believe it.  

And believe this.

You see, I expected this half-wit bourgie (slang for bourgeouis) to step out of her stretched navigator upon arrival of red carpet and camera flashes.  This place may have been too trite; but understand, I was just a lowly traveler following the drove of Avondalians, Goodyearians, Litchfielder's and heaven forbid...even Tollesoners who made up the greater of South-westerners  who were obviously deprived of Barbeque.  Heck, the lines has been out the door since their opening.  And for good reason!

But not in the eyes of Ms. Melody C.   You see, waiting in line to pay for your own food and than, gasp...be seated next to nice families, old people, maybe families with old people and children or even children themselves with no families; I don't know...but you do have a choice of sitting on a picnic bench that line the sit-downs across.  Melody C. failed to see that there are also individual little mini-benches for Snobs who care not to sit next to normal people.  And why should people like her sit next to people like you and me, folks?  I mean, there is a huge difference and according to Melody C....it's because we don't adorn our homes with just pictures of ourselves with our faces smashed next to a similar looking drunk Snottsdale bourgie while what appears to be flashing a gang symbol.  Alas, it is not folks...be relieved as it is just the hand symbols that represent her greek letter organization.  

I expected her to walk past the red carpet, wait in the non-vip line as with everyone else and gently setting her purse down and saying \"Ewww\" as she notices a guy in a cardinal's jersey stand near her $2,500 prada bag and saying \"YOU'RE STEPPING ON MY PRADA BAG! It's worth more than your paycheck! Get the ___ off!\"  

Yep.  

Food - excellent.  Price, great!  It's barbeque and long overdue for South West valley.  Everything is alacarte but not as expensive - line wraps around metal iced troughs with all sorts of bottled soda, beers and delights!  Nice.  Once you get to the counter with 6 people screaming \"next!\"  to registers - order your alacartes; they place everything in black plastic bread trays where they slide your non-bourgie card and send you off to the abyss where there is a pickle and pepperonchini, and raw onion bar.  Nice.  Paper towels, plastic utensils, and even rows of butcher paper so that you could go sit next to someone like myself, and some kids, and old people and even Melody C. who is grumbling to herself and can't believe she just spent the lint and pocket change for food only to wait in line and sit on a picnic bench. 

By the way.  Did I mention that there are two barbeque sauces on each end of the picnic tables - not the best bbq food I've eaten, but it's dang good and the creamed corn is absolutely delicious.  Family had the jalapeno smoked sausage, BBQ ribs, some loaded potato, pudding, a ginormous rice krispie treat, etc.  Awesomeness.  I went on the Friday before Father's day - I loved it.  Down to earth and awesome.  And the staff there sometimes has hats that are cabella camouflage/duck dynastish and others don't....I think it's a rank system to be wearing that hat and some don't.  I'll figure it out later as soon as I'm done digesting.  A little over $34.00 for family of four....a la carte.  Not bad at all.....sans duck dynasty hats."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Went for lunch a couple days ago...get there early or be prepared to wait! 

Had a brisket sandwich, beans and hot link. I loved everything except the beans...nothing wrong with them, just not my taste. To me, the beans were a little bland. But the BBQ was top notch! 

Will be back again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"I've always heard about this place and finally got to try it and the food and service was amazing. Very affordable and will be coming back soon. Everything was just so good."}
{"text":"Love the beef brisket, all time favorite is BBQ and Rudy's always hits the spot. Only issue I have is their sauce, flat out sucks!!! I'm not sure what it is about it but I always have an uneasy feeling in my stomach after eating the bbq sauce. If I get food to go I always use my own bbq sauce from home. Please get some better bbq sauce!!"}
{"text":"We've been going here ever since they opened. Their BBQ meat is delicious! The prime rib is my favorite. It's very casual dining; sometimes shared seating if all the picnic benches are full. Love that they sell their sauce in big bottles to take home!"}
{"text":"Friday mornings are breakfast tacos for my co-workers. Get a variety of meats from brisket, bacon, sausage and more to go along with eggs, potato's, and cheese. Easy call ahead order & pickup!"}
{"text":"Nowhere near as good as Can't Stop Smokin', which is next door.

I have only been once and have never been back.

The pulled pork sandwich was awful, I don't know what sauce they use but it tastes terrible.  The sides weren't very good either and they gave me sandwich bread instead of a BBQ bun.

Also, only bottled drinks?  I don't get it.

Go next door instead."}
{"text":"Good BBQ + fair prices + LOOOOONG lines

One of the top three BBQ places in Phoenix Metro in my experience.  They smoke their meats to a moist and tender perfection.  You then choose one of the sauces to bathe the meat in.  

I prefer BBQ styles where the meat is cooked with the BBQ sauce and with more smoke flavor in the meat itself.  Yay for \"smoke rings\".  That said, Rudy's really cooks their stuff well and the sauce options offer a good combo.  

Potato salad and chocolate pudding are worthy add-ons to the meal.  The sausage options are the best things on the menu.  Kids menu is helpful.  And they have very nice staff.

Tip: If the line is still out the door, find somewhere else to eat and come back when the line is sane.

Taking a star off simply for that line and wait.  Lines can be atrociously long and you'll see plenty of company as you weave to the cashiers.  People get progressively grumpy as the minutes tick by in the tens.  By the time you're about to order, folks are making snide remarks at each other and kids are getting in trouble from boredom."}
{"text":"So I've had BBQ all around the country, I'm a big fan and get to travel. Gotta say that this was so-so. I see the great reviews (what got me here) but I'd give it a 5 out of 10. Environment is awesome!  True southwest place. Really cool. But the food was so-so. They start you with samples which is good. I went with my safe bet, brisket and pulled pork. They have a dry tough lean brisket and a moist fatty brisket. The mounts was my choice. It's just ok. Really not great. Some brisket you eat with no sauce it's so darn good. Not here. Gotta soak it in for flavor.  The pulled pork is pre-seasoned and really wet. Paying for the wet here on the weight for sure. Had to soak that in sauce too. Now, the sauce is good, darn good too or I'd be stuck. So overall great place, 3 stars or less on the food."}
{"text":"Is good food and friendly service but would be best if the serve food on plate not paper, but food is great"}
{"text":"Have been to the Rudys in Selma,TX and this location is spot on to the original (except for the gas station). Meats were tender and the Cole slaw was well seasoned. Went near closing so it was not crowded. Would recommend."}
{"text":"My first time here. Was recommended by my coworker.. gotta say the service was great was greedy when i came into the door. My cashier was great she helped me out with any requests needs wish i knw her name to add but she just got her nails done and which was cute.. anyway i had pull pork sandwich,1/2 pd brisket most and pinto bean.. I love everything and would come back as well as recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yeasterday and it was fantastic as usual.  It does not seem to matter what you order the meats are all fantastic.  If you are not sure what you want they will let you sample a few things first.  I do have to say that so far I have not found a side item that is any were near as good as the meats.  I have tried the coleslaw, potato salid, cream corn and corn on the cob, all just ok.  But who cares the meats are so good you wont want to waist a single bite on anything else.  So skip them and get more meat you can't go wrong.  The Bannana puddings is very good though."}
{"text":"Not planning on going here yet while in the parking lot, I followed my nose and glad I did! As the other reviews mentioned, their meat is served by the lb! Then you purchase the sides. They also give you almost a whole loaf of bread just in case you want to go up a pant size after our meal. 
I tried the pork. It was juicy and just delicious. Their sauce is at each table so you can go nuts with it if you'd like. 
I like how the food is served in industrial plastic trays, like the kinds used for soda 2 liters. They make sure you know they aren't messing around. 
Great BBQ place in Chandler!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating at Rudys for many years starting in New Braunfels Texas. Every store has a slightly different assortment of meats. In every Texas Rudys the Prime Rib was sold out by early lunch. So it was a great surprise when we were able to buy 1 and 1/2 pounds of outstanding medium rare Prime Rib. I can honestly say I have eaten Prime Rib at least 300 times and this would be in my top 5 ever. Afterwards we bought  another pound to take home.

In addition we had the moist brisket and the pork loin. Both of which were outstanding. Easily puts all AZ BBQ to shame.

As a note to the confused people out there... Lean Brisket means no fat and you want your brisket DRY! So stop complaining your LEAN DRY brisket is dry. You ordered it that way. Moist means extra fat and deliciousness. Otherwise normal is a mix of both."}
{"text":"Outstanding BBQ!!! We had the Brisket Moist the best way to go, pork loin, PRIME RIB OUTSTANDING, sausage link, Potatoe salad, and banana pudding. The Prime Rib is by far the best. Everything was perfectly cooked and just like the original stores in Texas.  

Only complaint is with the people slicing the meat. it is very inconsistent in thickness. The same slice is 1/2 thick to paper thin. This BBQ should be thicker slices 1/4 to 1/2 is fine. Also when a pound of meat takes three tries to get to a pound is horrible and slows down the line. we ended up ordering 5 lbs of meat and it took 13 tries to end up with the right amount of food per type ordered.


Keep in mind this is a buy it by the pound BBQ joint. Lots of meat choices. Lots of excellent cold sides. Plenty of choices for everyone.  Also Lean is low fat so it can be dry. Moist is fatty but extra flavorful and far from dry. The prime rib is excellent"}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is nice. I like the casual family style atmosphere. You have to try the beef brisket. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best barbecue anywhere. Any time I make a trip down to the valley I try to stop here. My favorite is the moist brisket. The sausages are also incredible. The sauce goes perfectly with everything. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ west of Texas! Moist brisket melts in your mouth. Prime rib is awesome. I always get the creamed corn and enjoy my meal with a cold pop from their ice case. Neat set up, fun and casual pick nick table atmosphere. Love this place. Samples and service with a smile too - you don't find that too often."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Goodyear. Loaded baked potato with moist brisket is my go to but they have many other good items that I enjoy. Turkey is very good and has just the right amount of moisture. Makes great left overs also so buy extra! Buy a plastic cup and bring it in for .75 refills.

I've probably been here 50+ times..."}
{"text":"OUCH....ohhhhhhhhhhh......I can't move.  I'm still digesting from a week ago...I swear!  This food is so good, that you canNOT stop eating. Your mind says \"stop...\" but your mouth just keeps devouring.

I was in Texas for a few months a couple of years ago, and fell in love with the bbq there.  When we went to Rudy's it was like I was back in Houston.  The meats are AMAZING.  The brisket (moist) is well, moist.  The spicy meat is SO undernamed.  It is delectable.  The pulled pork is awesome, the sausage...wow.  

They use a dry rub method...no sauce.  Sauces are available on the tables, but the meat is scrumptious without any sauce!  We ordered several and shared.  When you come for the first time, they will let you taste each meat...so you know what to order!

Then there are the sides.  Awesome creamed corn, the beans are just perfect.  The potatoes and plain bread didn't thrill me, but no one is perfect.

You eat on paper, which is easy to clean up...and you can either wash your hands in the trough or ....lick them off!  It's acceptable here!  Ya'll come in now, ya here?"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty for the price! The brisket was really yummy and so was the pulled pork and sausage. The only think that was kind of bland was their new potatoes. I was expecting more flavour. Other than that, the service was rather quick and the staff was very friendly. I'm definitely going to come back soon :)"}
{"text":"Before coming here, I had only been to the original location in Texas, so I was pretty stoked to find this place in Arizona. When you come here, things you must order is BRISKET MOIST and CREAM CORN. Also, get their sweet tea if you're into that. 

But once you get the brisket, get some white sliced bread and smother it in the Rudy's BBQ sause, none of that sissy stuff, use the normal one, and you will be make your tummy happy."}
{"text":"Been here three times.  I'm not really a fan of the picnic tables and the BBQ is just ok.  

When this place opened the lines to get in were insane.  Now that everyone has tried it, no more crazy lines."}
{"text":"First time here and they gave us a free sample to taste the meats.  The food is great!  I loved the sausage and brisket.  Topped off our meal with a Shiner Bock and pecan pie!  The customer service is great.  Lots of seating inside and on the patio.  Also they are open 24/7 so come on in and grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Yes, I can finally get my Texas brisket in Arizona! As a native of San Antonio, I loved going to Rudy's as a kid.  Heck, when I visited my sister when she lived in Austin, we went to the Rudy's in Round Rock and had a great time.  If you are looking for some authentic Texan brisket this is the place.  Did I also mention they have Big Red on the fountain??  Please come to Tucson Rudy's!!"}
{"text":"They have a store upfront where you can pick up your own \"Sause\" and/or Rub, and a breakfast taco if you're in a rush.   The meat is very high-quality and the Sauce to die for.  First had Rudy's in the late 80's brought in from TX, I was hooked.  What a treat having it local.  I went there last week around 12:30- they were giving the breakfast taco's away, that never happens before you wait in line to buy food.  They are generous with the protein and you will discover lunch costs more at McDonald's.

Don't let the long lines fool you - it moves fast!"}
{"text":"I had not been to Rudy's for many months because I really was never impressed with their pulled pork and much prefer a couple other BBQ joints in Phoenix. But I decided to give their brisket a try. I had sampled the lean brisket when they first opened and it was really dry, so I decided to get the moist brisket, which seems to be very popular. That was a mistake. It was so fatty! Which, yes, I understand that's what makes it moist, but it was just so unappetizing to me. I really don't care much for their BBQ sauce either. It's too peppery. The potato salad was barely cold. The beans were OK, but not as good as I remembered. No more Rudy's for me. I'll just keep making the drive to Pork on a Fork & Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"We went to Rudy's for lunch today 3/7/15... it was our first time. Very organized with very friendly staff. You have the option to eat indoor or out of doors. Plenty of extras. They have a courtesy hand waste area if you have a need after eating fabulous baby back ribs. Also large paper rolls available to set your ribs on to make it a pleasant experience of eating.  It is very pleasant. The brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were excellent tasty sandwiches.Cole Slaw and Potatoe Salad were super. Pecan Pie is fresh and tasty.
No question definitely going back. Prices very reasonable :-)"}
{"text":"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Goodyear on Litchfield Road and with brightly lit neon signs (at least that's what I thought it was) you definitely can't miss this place.  Parking is plentiful though it was a bit tough to find a spot when we went on a Friday night, thankfully there were a couple available spots.  Parking lot is large and well lit too.
As we approached the front door/entrance we encountered a long line going out the door and wondered if we had to make reservations or what.  As we discussed whether to do take out, a friendly patron who overheard us told us to not question the long line and it was actually well worth to wait.  She even suggested we try the sliced turkey!

Menu - The menu is very simple and is posted on large billboard like signs over the cashiers, on your way to the cashiers, and a copy is even handed to you as you enter.  Everything is served a la carte and the meats are served by the pound with their prices being very reasonable!

Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  As you enter, you're asked if you've ever been here before, and if not, a brief explanation of how their system of ordering and their menu works....wasn't difficult to comprehend. 

Food - On my way to the cashier's, one encounters a large trough filled with a variety of drinks, even alcohol all in ice-cold water with lots of ice.  If you desire, you can grab a small bucket and start filling it with various bottles of soda or alcohol to start consuming (which I saw) or wait till you get to the cashiers for checkout.  
On your way to the cashiers, there's also a fridge that houses their signature potato salad, coleslaw, desserts, etc. to be grabbed if you want to add it to your meal.  I grabbed the potato salad which was rich, creamy, well seasoned, and very tasty.  
As you get to the cashiers, you'll be greeted yet again, and asked if you've been here before.  If the answer is no, then you'll be given samples of any meat on the menu you'd like to try or you can simply refuse and go straight to the ordering if you so desire which I did and opted for the 1/2 lb. of baby back ribs.  
Normally I'm not a fan of my baby back ribs falling off the bone so this suited me just fine.  It was semi-tender and you had to do a bit of work to get it off the bone which is the way I like it and it was very juicy, tasty, and supremely delicious.  My only regret was that I only ordered the 1/2 lb. rather than the whole but this gives me reason to return!  
After the rest in my party had their samples and ordered, we ordered a small fountain drink (unlimited refills I believe).
The layout of the place is unusual because obviously they've eliminated the waiter/waitress because you order your food and then you choose to eat though this takes place in a restaurant-styled atmosphere.  The tables are long picnic like tables so basically you choose anywhere you want to eat, sit and enjoy mind you the tables are together (though not all) so the potential to have others be sitting next to you is there.  On the tables, you can choose anyway you'd like to eat (be sure to clean up after yourself though) plus their sauces are never too far away on the table and there's plenty of it too....in large bottles so there's enough for everyone in your party!

Definitely will be coming back here for more of their meats, e.g. sliced turkey, brisket, etc."}
{"text":"Always a solid for good Q.  You know what you are going to get, good smoked meat and good sides.  Should have came here instead of Famous Dave's..."}
{"text":"Expensive, so red neck the meet is not god the ribs or no good coleslaw eww no espectacular i never ever i thinki not going to come back oh! Plus its flys everywhere is no let me eat  the most ugly experience i prefer drive a couple more miles and go to FAMOUS DAVES"}
{"text":"I've been going to Rudy's for years while traveling on business in Albuquerque, El Paso, and more recently, Colorado Springs.  It's a place I look forward to anytime.  When I saw they were building a location, I was incredibly excited.  

The place is clean (as expected on the first day of business).  I was greeted right away upon showing up.  They had a line at 11am, and I showed up around 2:30, the first time the line didn't extend outside.  They did a great job of making sure the tables were kept clean, etc.  Something that often seems overlooked when a place is packed/busy.

Being their first day open, I was expecting some delays and mistakes, but I think everything went smoothly considering many of the customers were new to the process as well as the employees.  I got what I ordered, quickly and efficiently.  I ordered a 1/2 lb of moist brisket (.53 lb to be exact), some \"new potatoes\" (red potatoes) and corn on the cob.  Had them throw some bread slices in.  They give you a great bottle crate to carry all the food.  It's better than a tray.  They can really pack it in there.  I got a large drink, as I plan to keep the cup and just bring it back for the $.75 refills.  They had fresh iced tea and everything was clean and organized.  I found a table and started eating.  I had just eaten at the Albuquerque location last weekend, but this was amazing.  Tasted as good as usual and I was impressed.  

I live in Central Phoenix and head out to the east valley once or twice a week.  I usually always head to Joe's in Gilbert, and will continue to do so occasionally even though I don't think it's as good (Rudy's brisket is better and they have corn on the cob and red potatoes - two things I wish Joe's had) or as consistent.  Given the choice, I'll pick Rudy's, though.  Our other local places don't hold a candle to Rudy's.

They all seem to run about the same price.  I was out of there for $13.98, which is about $1 more than Joes, but you get more food - just enough in fact.

It's a bit of a drive for me, but it's worth it.  I'll just have to make more excuses to be in the area.  I was very surprised to see that someone is opening a BBQ place directly across the street.  I admire the entrepreneurial spirit in this economy, but I'm afraid that they won't stand a chance with a Rudy's around."}
{"text":"My husband had gone here and raved about this place so I decided to come back with him.  I first noticed the unappealing decor; plastic tables and chairs... However, they also had wooden picnic benches, which were a little more aesthetic.  I also liked the foot handle that they have on the bottom of the bathroom doors so you don't have to open the door with your hands.  The sandwich prices appear fare but once you add sides and a drink to your sandwich, it get's costly.  I did not like that they use disposable utensils, plates and cups.  I understand that they are trying to keep from having servers but Panera Bread uses reusable dishes and utensils and do just fine without servers.  I got the pulled pork sandwich.  It tasted fine at first but then I noticed a strange aftertaste, kind of chemical-like.  The place seemed very popular but I am not sure I would come back."}
{"text":"Just not my style.  Waited in a long line for mediocre food.  Ribs were not very meaty, a bit dry.  Sat on hard benches, flies all over the place."}
{"text":"I always get delicious wood-smoked BBQ here.  The first thing you notice when waking up to the restaurant is the wood smoke, which gets me salivating.  The place is as casual as a place can get and always great for big groups or families with young, noisy kids. 

The BBQ is great and I prefer the brisket, pulled pork, or jalape√±o sausage. The sides and bottles soda/beer are tasty, too. 

Do yourself a favor and grab a bottle of Shiner Bock, 1/2 lb of brisket, some white bread, and a handful of napkins, and go to town with the Rudy's original (little spicy) BBQ sauce. You will be in a heavenly food coma in no time."}
{"text":"Rudy's reminds me of BBQ places back home in Texas (That is where they are from by the way). You order by the pound not by the plate. I personally prefer this. You order at the counter and take it to the table. Now if you are not a people person then this is not the place for you. You eat at long tables with everyone else, so be nice and be respectful. Maybe strike up a conversation with the people sitting next to you. It won't hurt, I promise. The BBQ is almost always great as well as the sausage and sauce. I will say that the Rudy's in Texas taste better for some reason but this is pretty good. The atmosphere is great and so is the staff. Will continue to visit this little slice of home here in AZ."}
{"text":"This is about the best BBQ I have EVER had.  Yup, a little on the pricey side, but well worth it.  EVERYTHING is YUMMY.  Even the coleslaw and I DONT like cole slaw.   LOL.  Not sure why there is a BBQ place next door to Rudy's.  Make sure you dont go to the wrong BBQ place.  This one is closest to the freeway."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good barbecue place since I left the south, and this lived up to everything I expect! Rudy's is one of the better Barbecue places in the valley! When you walk in the atmosphere and smells make you feel like you are at an authentic barbecue restaurant. The staff is very up beat and service is fast. Had the beef brisket sandwich with a baked potato and neither one disappointed. The Potato was HUGE, and very freshly cooked! Wished they offered more sides on the menu, but I was very satisfied overall! Don't miss out on the opportunity to check this place out for lunch, dinner or anytime you are just craving barbecue. Just typing this review about the place makes me want to go back now!"}
{"text":"it was good. not great. not bad. just good. sausage was the best thing i have had from here. brisket was extremely fatty. 50-50 meat to fat. ribs were dry tasty but needed milk or an extra dip in the bbq sauce which was good."}
{"text":"4 Stars Because of a few factors

BBQ is awesome, moist delicious and seasoned perfectly with smoke, herbs and more.  We had the turkey, lean brisket, beans, corn on the cob and cream corn.  To compare with other bbq joints they only serve meals family style meaning that if you are looking for a combo meal this isn't the place.   I would say this is probably the best BBQ on the west side hands down.  The bbq quality and flavor rivals that of someone with a famous name.  The bbq sauce didn't impress me though.  

How this BBQ joint works:

 This is the place for sharing bbq with family and friends.  Each meat is weighed by the half pound right in front of you.  There are no servers.  You go up to the counter and order and there is basically not wait as the person behind the counter goes and gets your order right away from the cooks cutting the meat and such also behind the counter.  Its a bit chaotic at first but I can see how the system works.  You also have to pick up your drinks before you hit the front counter as well.

The line is a bit weird as it snakes around the restaurant.  Someone in line said it was like waiting for a ride at disney.  

So overall I would say you should blaze a new trail.  The lines look long but they go fast."}
{"text":"I love this atmosphere. It's like going to a friends giant BBQ. Beers in the cooler, meat by the pint, pickles, potato salad, macaroni salad and coleslaw... yes please!"}
{"text":"This is down and dirty serious BBQ. There's nothing fancy here except me, lol. Really though, not even plates. Your food come on wax paper, and it's weighed as you order. The menu is simple, priced by the pound. It's cheap, and it's delicious. It is also the most Ketogenic friendly restaurant around. Don't worry if you're a carb lover they do have bread and sweets also. They also have beer and wine a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Went in last night to try it out. The gentleman at the door was very friendly and helpful and explained how everything worked. When we got to the counter to order, they asked if we were first timers and brought out some samples. Ordered a couple different kinds of meat, some corn on the cob and a smoked potato with meat. The young lady working the counter was very nice and helped explain the menu further. Everything was pretty good and the seating was interesting with both large and small picnic-style tables. Definitely not the best BBQ I've ever had but it was good enough that I wouldn't mind going again."}
{"text":"Pretty good, basic selection, no plate combos. A little pricy with sides, min $2.00 each. Overall pleasant meal of beef brisket sandwich, ample meat serving. Will try again."}
{"text":"Best brisket sandwiches anywhere.  Their BBQ sauce is great too.  You really get your money's worth."}
{"text":"It's Thursday early evening decided to celebrate my grandsons 9th birthday with some BBQ . Rudy's just opened up so we packed the cars and headed to Avondale. First impression was these guys don't know  about the AZ heat. Waited in line outside with the sun beating down on us. Should have put the entrance on another side of the building, not the west side. HOT
Once inside we found out that all the meats were sold by the pound.. Kinda like a sate fair ambience. Picnic tables and cafeteria tables with steel folding chairs, not comfortable. 
Now the brisket was worth the wait but the baby back ribs were not as I expected. I've had better in my own backyard . The chicken was , well chicken. Let's get to the best part, at least for me. The beer! The beer was on ice. Enough said. But if I wanted cold beer I would have stayed at Bejardise. 
There are better BBQ establishments. So if your in the mood for some good old fashion BBQ stick with your favorite place, they deserve your patronage.
Sorry Avondale, Rudy's is in Goodyear"}
{"text":"We are at a Rudy's in Manitou Springs, CO, so when we saw Rudy's on Yelp when in Az, we just HAD to go. And we were not disappointed! 

Took some friends who are on low carb diets.... there is no better place for a carnivore to get their protein bomb! 

We had brisket (my favorite), pork, sausage, and turkey. Sides of Cole slaw and creamed corn for us, along with cheap white bread and pickles. Such a tasty meal. The brisket is so Moist and smoky. And I Love the Rudy's sause!! So perfect with these smoked meats.

Order at the counter, meats by the pound, sides by the pint, free white bread. Bottled beers iced down in coolers as you approach the counter. Desserts and cold sides in a fridge just before the counter. (I do not recommend the banana pudding, but the Cole slaw is good! Pickles, onions, peppers at a salad bar.

No plates. You eat off wax paper with plastic utensils. No fancy pants here!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time today. Everyone is so nice, from the time you walk in until the time you leave. It's really a welcoming atmosphere, they gave us free samples and we ended up buying a little of everything. Much better than Dickeys BBQ. Very satisfied and will be returning."}
{"text":"Rudys always comes through when you need a great BBQ fix. Everything is awesome but the Turkey leaves all other BBQ places in the coals."}
{"text":"This place and atmosphere is def something new, and we love it.. The food is good-great, prices match that as well... I heard the Bfast burros were off the chain, will try those next time."}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit Rudy's on a few occasions while visiting San Antonio so I was excited when I heard they opened an AZ location.   My only wish is that it was closer to my home.   
My recommendation is to try a little bit of everything.  Brisket, turkey, sausage, and ribs for the main dishes and the creamed corn is a must have for a side dish."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and well worth the wait and drive..smoke sausage was delicious as well as the moist brisket and ribs..red potatoes with butter makes a perfect side as well as cole slaw.."}
{"text":"Incredible food, and good service. I love the huge baked potato stuffed with all the good stuff and pulled pork. 

There is a small country store in the front with sodas, ice, beer and snacks, then the restraunt towards the back. Their food is incredible and full of flavor. We are a huge BBQ family and have already returned 3 times since our first introduction. It's picnic bench seating, and you eat in paper instead of plates. Which, is really cool and not at all a deterrent. I only tell you so you can be prepared for things to get a little messy :-)"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the full parking lot!!  If it was great the lengthy line would be worth it.. The BBQ sauce had no taste and we had the brisket and pulled pork and after a few bites we swore we would never come back!  Highly disappointed cuz there are not a lot of BBQ places in the area so we were so excited... Oh well, we will just keep hoping for a new place to open.."}
{"text":"Was there not too long ago. The portions would be adecuate for a 3 year old. Pretty overpriced and not impressed with texture and flavor. Bland. Definitely not even close to Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"Now that they've unhidden the review, I can be honest and tell you how much it sucks, rather than saying This place is GREAT!  And if you don't say so, they'll have your comments deleted!  So even though there's absolutely no smoke in their meats, even though the dominant flavor in the ribs is ridiclously un-yummy amounts of black pepper, I have to say, it's great!  No, really, I have to say it, because they won't let anyone say anything else.  Awesome, I tell you!  Most awesomely sorry excuse for barbecue you will ever run into, but it's GREAT!  Can't you see the smile on my face?  Yeah."}
{"text":"I think you need to be SUPER hungry to eat here  they have a great brisket (lean and moist). I also had the three bean salad and it was delicious. Siblings had the peach cobbler and potato salad, also delicious! The sweet tea was delicious. It you definitely want to have water or soda water with your meal. 

We were disappointed with the barbecue sauce though. It was more acidic that molassesy. So if you like sweet baby rays you may not like this BBQ sauce. The hot sauce options at the table were also lacking. 

I have 4 stars, because the food was delicious. The condiments could be better, barbecue is only as good as its sauce in my opinion."}
{"text":"Rudy's Country Store and Bar-B-Q is a great restaurant because they have fast and friendly customer service, great barbecue, cleanliness, and a lot of wholesome country character. Employees have a sense of urgency while helping you to ensure that you can get through the line quickly. Since the meat is priced by the pound, it helps keep the employees moving the line quickly. They carry plenty of sides, from potato salad to green chile stew, to go along with any main dish you choose. I'm a forever customer!"}
{"text":"Really nice place, their breakfast burritos are definitely not the greatest, so hit it up for dinner instead."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get take out. Staff is on the ball and very friendly, if it's your first time, don't worry they will guide you through it! 
Corey was very helpful and friendly, the service industry needs more like him! 
The pulled pork is amazing, I must say it is the best I have had! It does not even need BBQ sauce it is that flavorful and tender. The potato salad is excellent too, the potatoes almost have a smokey flavor! The restaurant has a great welcoming charm. 
Please open up more locations!"}
{"text":"Dear Rudy's,

Oh, how I've missed you!

It was so great to see you today. Your baby back ribs tasted as good as I remembered. I don't know how you are able to smoke them AND still manage to keep them so moist! I don't even put sauce on them; they're delicious on their own. 

I also had your tasty lean brisket that had a nice bark to them. I even tried your pork ribs for the first time. While they were more meaty than the baby backs, they were not as moist or flavorful. 

To add some veggies into the mix, I had some of your coleslaw and corn on the cob, both of which seemed really plain. It's okay though, cause we all know nobody comes here for the sides--unless they're the outvoted vegetarian in a group of bbq lovers!

For dessert, I got your regular praline and chewy praline. The regular one pretty much tasted like brown sugar with pecans. The chewy one however, was divine; the caramel version of pecan pie. 

Thank you for a great lunch today. I don't know when I'll see you again, but I will think of you often. 

Bbq Wishes,
J"}
{"text":"I got the baked potato with brisket. I love the environment in Rudy's but the meat was average. The barbecue sauce make some breaks the meal and it definitely wasn't anything special!"}
{"text":"After years and years of enjoying the good BBQ, I'm done.  The last 5 visits have served me brisket that was so tough and full of gristle I couldn't eat it.  One time is a mistake or an Isolated experience and I have come back hoping the quality would improve.  I told the manager that the cutters could easily prevent this but they don't.  Disappointing.  There are too many other options, i won't be back."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

Right when we pulled up and parked you could smell the smoke.  We parked right in front of where they load the wood into their smokers.  It was a good sight to see.  Looked like we were in for some great BBQ.  We got in line and I was in awe of the big smokers they have behind the counter.  When you order your stuff, they pull it out of the smoker and cut it fresh for you and weigh it right in front of you on a scale.  They then place it on butcher paper and into a milk carton type tray.  I couldn't wait to try it!  We were in for some grub!  There was no line either (probably due to Easter) at almost noon which was a score!


One of my coworkers used to work at a Rudys in Texas many years ago and he recommended I get a few things....  Pork ribs, creamed corn and a loaded baked potato with meat.  We got that and a whole bunch more too ;-).  We got 1/4 pound lean brisket, 1/4 pound smoked turkey, 3 pork ribs, 3 baby back ribs, a half chicken, a loaded baked potato with brisket on top, some creamed corn and some drinks. They also give you slices of white/wheat bread for free so you can make sandwiches out of your meat.  Total came out to $35.00.

Here is how the food stacked up..................

Pork Ribs- These things were fantastic.  They had a fantastic bark on them.  Almost looked burnt but they weren't.  They tasted great and had a strong pepper/smoke flavor to them.  I liked them a lot and my friend wasn't lying when he recommended them.  They were awesome!

Baby Back Ribs-  These were great too.  Not as blackened as the pork ribs but still seasoned well.  The meat came off the bone with just a little tug.  Damn they were good!

Smoked Turkey-  Delicious!  It had the perfect amount of smoke flavor but was still pretty moist and not dried out.  My best friend is a turkey lover (he ordered turkey every chance he could on our KC/Memphis trip a few years back).  He would have loved this stuff.  It was great!

Lean Brisket-  I'm usually not a big brisket fan but this stuff was legit.  You could see the straight up smoke ring around the edge of the meat.  It was tender and delicious.  I don't know if I have ever had better brisket.  I would definitely get it again.

Loaded Baked Potato-  They give you a softball sized baked potato and top it with a ton of butter, cheese, sour cream (we skipped the sour cream) and your choice of meat.  We got brisket on it and unlike the slices of brisket they give you when you order brisket on its own, this stuff was almost like burnt ends chunked brisket.  Tasted great!

Half Chicken-  This is the only thing we didn't really like.  We picked at it a bit and it had a great smoked flavor but we were so full from everything else that we tossed most of it.  Wouldn't get it again.

Creamed Corn-  This was just ok.  I like corn but usually when its corn on the cob.  Plain corn I will eat but I'm not the biggest fan.  This corn tasted like frozen corn you can buy and then they creamed it up.  Its almost like a gravy of sorts.  I probably would not get it again.  We tossed most of it.

Coke products in the fountain drinks.  They had a grip of bottled drinks/beer in huge metal tubs of ice too.  It was cool to see.  My wife got a root beer in a bottle and liked it.

Service was friendly.  They did forget to give me my potato at first but then when we brought it to their attention they got on top of it right away and brought it out to our table.  Total of $35.00 for the giant crate of food we got was well worth it IMO.  

This was some of the best BBQ I have had in a long long time.  It reminded me of me and my buddies trip to KC and Memphis a few years back.  The smoked meats are delicious and I would come back often if I lived out here.  Don't even ask me how their BBQ sauce tasted.......I didn't try it.  The meat was so damn good it didn't need any.  That's a winner folks!  Legit Texas BBQ at its finest!"}
{"text":"This was yay close to getting a 1!  It was pretty damn bad.  Totally disappointed and I will never come back to this one.  The one in Chandler was good when we went but this one in Goodyear SUCKED!

I walked in and placed my order for 3 pork ribs, 3 baby back ribs, 1/4lb of fatty brisket and a half of a jalapeno sausage.  That and a small drink came out to $28.00!  Jesus Christ, right?  I don't mind paying top dollar for food.  Price doesn't phase me.  When it's for slop though, it does.  This was some slop for the most part.  Paid the lady my money, got my drink and took a seat.  Here is how everything was......................

Baby Back Ribs-  Horrible.  Absolutely horrible!  I probably should have taken them back and gotten my money refunded.  They were tough as nails.  Baby backs usually are the most tender ribs and they should fall off the bone rather easily.  Not these things.  I had to use my hyena jaws to try and get the meat off these things.  The membrane was tough, the meat didn't even taste good, they were curled up for some weird reason, and they seemed like they were baked instead of smoked/bbqd.  They were the worst ribs I have ever had in my 36 years on Earth.  Boiled ribs from the cafeteria in grade school were eons better than these things.  You couldn't pay me to try these again!

Fatty Brisket-  Another disappointment.  Instead of slicing the brisket, they serve it all hacked up in chunks.  That in itself can be ok.  The fact that 1/2 of my 1/4lb was congealed fat globs is not ok.  I understand \"fatty\" and am down with some fat and it does make things delicious. I am not down with a whole pile of grease and chunks upon chunks of fat though.  I picked around it and ate most of it, but once again I was disappointed.  I would not get it again.  After having proper brisket 2 weeks ago, this stuff is just dog food compared to what brisket is supposed to be like.  I would never get brisket here again.

1/2 Jalapeno Sausage-  Strike 3!  This sausage was presented nicely, split down the middle and you could see the chunks of jalapenos in it.  The taste of it was not good though.  It was lukewarm and kind of dry.  The casing was a bit too thick and chewy and the taste was just meh.  I wouldn't get one again.

Pork Ribs-  The ONLY redeeming thing about this meal and the ONLY thing saving it from a 1 star review.  These pork ribs were actually fantastic!  They were smoked nice, meaty, tender and delicious.  I should have just ordered a pound of these things and it would have been a good meal.  I don't get how these things can be so great yet the other 3 meats I tried were absolutely horrible!  If I come back (99% sure I wont), I will only order the pork ribs.

Service was fine.  The cashier was nice and friendly.  The food blew though AND it was expensive.  That is a deadly combo right there and a waste of almost $30 bucks.  I will go back to the Chandler one sometime in the future to see if they are still good.  If they are lacking too, Rudys is out of my rotation.  Much better BBQ out there in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed when I went there for my first time last month....the al a carte ordering was a drag...was expecting bread with my portions of meat or at least the option of ordering a side of toast or corn muffin...none of which is available and is usually standard with a bbq type meal! The service was really good tho...the girl asked if we had been there before in which we replied no and even though it was quite busy she gave us some samples of the meat.  Because we didn't want just piles of meat on a plate we opted for the sandwiches (brisket and pulled pork). We also order 2 ears of corn, the refrigerated prepackaged Coleslaw and a sausage link. The corn tasted like it had previously been frozen and thawed out...the coleslaw was very dry and almost flavorless but the sausage link was great! The brisket and the pulled pork were average. You aren't given sauce on your meat at time of purchase. You have 2 bottles (2 separate options/flavors) at each table. Both bottles were very dirty and the pour spouts on them weren't made for thick sauce. We weren't able to get any sauce out of the one container so opted for only one flavor. Where as famous Daves has 6 flavors, corn bread, tx toast options. (I can go on and on). So I wasn't impressed and prob won't go back or recommend it. 

I was VERY impressed at their military appreciation discount tho!"}
{"text":"Great Authentic BBQ!

My husband and I finally decided to check out Rudy's. It was beyond our expectations. The atmosphere is like a backyard BBQ at a friend's home. The seating is all picnic tables with bottle top openers and napkin holders all over the walls. 

First about the ordering, it is just like ordering at a fast food counter but so far from fast food. We had to stand in a line but getting the food wasn't any longer than what we would experience at a sit down restaurant. You wait in line and can pick your drinks and sides along the way. Once you get to the counter you tell them if you want any hot sides and what kind of meat you want. They get it ready right there as you wait. The food comes out on wax paper and in a crate and the meat is being cut right where you can see it. It is a different format from any other restaurant I have been in but I liked it. The meat is put in front of you on a scale like at a butcher shop but it is already cooked.  

I had the pulled pork sandwich and I could tell it was slow cooked to perfection. It doesn't come with BBQ sauce but there are two big jars at your table to add. My husband had the turkey sandwich and it looked like it was cut right off the bone. He said it was the best turkey sandwich he ever had. Nothing is done fancy there, it is all about the meat. 

I will go back many more times."}
{"text":"I live out in Ahwatukee and I swear there is no bbq joints within a ten mile radius, well unless you count honey bears a \"REAL\" bbq joint which I definitely do not.  Being a bbq connoisseur myself (claims the fiance), I was so thrilled to see a bbq joint come up right next to the 10.  

My fiance and I went Rudy's the second day they were open.  The line was out the door and I thought to myself \"This place has got to be amazing with a line like this!!\".  The line went pretty fast so it wasn't too bad.  I think it took us less than 30 mins to get up to the registers.  They sell meat by the 1/2 pounds and they weight all the meat right there in front of you.  They also give you your choice of wheat or white bread.  We only asked for 4 slices but we saw a guy in front of us ask for a whole loaf and they literally handed him a brand new loaf to take to his table!  They serve all your food on wax paper and put everything in a crate for you to carry to your table.  This, I was not too thrilled about cause I felt weird eating off my table with just some wax paper between my food and my table. 

So on to the food.....

My fiance and I ordered a half pound of babyback ribs (which are my favorite) and a half pound of their moist brisket (which is his favorite).  We also tried their cream corn, green chile stew, and their banana pudding for dessert.  I gotta say that I was highly disappointed with their ribs.  Maybe I'm not use to \"TEXAS\" style ribs, who knows?  As I was eating the ribs, I was telling my fiance that I know I'm eating a rib but its weird cause I feel like I'm eating a rotisserie chicken.  It didn't have much of a bbq taste to it at all. We both didn't finish it, it was just too weird eating ribs that taste like chicken.  With that being said, the brisket was AMAZING to say the least!  Nice and moist, perfectly cooked.  Probably the best in town!  Their cream corn is really good as well and that's coming from someone who doesn't like cream corn.  The green chile stew was to die for.  My fiance loved it so much he inhaled the whole thing before I knew it!  The banana pudding is just as good as everything else.

We did enjoy the food for the most part enough to come back a second time.  We pretty much ordered the same thing except I decided to try the half chicken instead of the ribs and come to realization that they use the same rub on their chicken as their ribs.  Which explains why I thought I was crazy thinking the ribs taste like chicken from my first experience!!  The chicken was nonetheless really good cause well, IT TASTED LIKE CHICKEN!! 

Overall, the place has the best brisket.  I had to give take away 1 star for the ribs.  Ribs are my favorite and if you can't do that right I don't know what else to tell ya!  The other star is for the whole eating on wax paper.  Rudy's is lucky my fiance is a man and doesn't care if he eats off dirt, but me, i prefer a plate thank you very much!  So if you're looking for the best brisket in town, Rudy's your joint, but if you're coming for some awesome ribs, I wouldn't suggest it.  I'll stick to Joe's Real BBQ for my ribs."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've had since I moved to AZ. My boyfriend and I went for date night and had an amazing experience."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. As a kid who grew up in Texas and lived 11 years in Florida for a total of 23 years in places with really good BBQ I would have to say I thoroughly enjoy their pulled pork and brisket. The turkey is okay but BBQ turkey isn't very good most places since turkey is dry. Heir BBQ sauces are pretty good, now if they would follow true southern fashion and have about five sauces and not two also their BBQ bar suffers from many canned ingredients and could use more fresh jalape√±os and pickles. I come here every time I visit Arizona and will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this evening with four family members and we were all genuinely impressed with Rudy's. From the second you walk in the door, the smell of hickory and mesquite hits you, just a small sample of the delicious food this place serves. The brisket and the pulled pork is absolutely delicious, personally I had a pulled pork sandwich. Each meat was seasoned to perfection and always moist and delicious how barbecue should be. Not to mention the large portion size for a reasonable price. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for really good barbecue!"}
{"text":"still have not had any bbq food only had to turkey sandwich so far and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Lawd have mercy.  When I moved from NM it I was having BBQ fits as I could not find the smokey goodness I was accustomed to with the 2 Rudy's available to me in Albuquerque.   The quest seemed endless and futile for bbq through the Valley until I found Texas BBQ house (24th St and Rosear).  They are so close for me in many ways (distance and flavor) they help quell that gnawing in the pit of my being for quality Texas style BBQ.  But on one of my last visits they did not have the cobbler or the smoked baked potatoes (so close!).  

I split my time between the 2 joints.  If I find myself in the SE valley I stop at Rudy's.  If I need some smoked baked potatoes for my famous smoked baked potato salad I go to Rudy's.   Otherwise it is a toss up.  But I have been willing to make the trek just to get my Rudy's fix. 

Other Rudy's musts:
-I usually get  a bit of moist and a bit of cutter's choice which is often lean.  
-I find the regular smoked sausage to be better than the jalapeno one.  
-Their smoked turkey is the best ever.  The chicken is just ok relatively.  [Both make great chicken enchiladas.]
-Pork Ribs are better than the Baby Backs IMHO
- Try the baked potato loaded with meat at least once.  Great to share or have as 1 filling or 2 (maybe 3 meals relative to your appetite) 
- Favorite sides:  Creamed corn, green chile stew and 3 bean salad"}
{"text":"I came here with my family on a trip to Arizona. Everyone was pretty nice but their food wasn't as good as I expected. We ordered baby back ribs, Banana pudding, A brisket sandwich, a apple cobble, corn on the cob, beans, and coleslaw. I felt like everything was tender, but bland. The only really good thing was the banana pudding and apple cobbler. The apple cobbler is also really good with ice cream. I have mixed feelings about coming back"}
{"text":"Let me preface all of this with I am not much of a meat eater and I generally don't care much fir barbecue. A friend picked this up when we were watching the Derby and wow!  Totally delicious. He offered and I accepted to take some leftovers home with me and just enjoyed some now.

We had the brisket, the turkey, some ribs and potato salad, cole slaw, three bean salad and bread. If you're not a barbecue fan, try this!  It's amazing."}
{"text":"Very yummy!!! Great service and if you never been they give samples of the meats to taste before ordering.  Great prices too!!!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  I usually order their spare ribs and their lean brisket when I go.  They try to push their moist brisket, but it is a fattier cut of meat.  Trust me..... the lean brisket is plenty moist!  The spare ribs are a decent size, but you won't get much bang for your buck since you order by the 1/4 pound.  Usually 1 pound of ribs is about 6 ribs.  The meat is smoked to perfection.  I have also tried the moist briket (good, but fatty), the baby back ribs (also good), and the pulled pork which was also very good.  I get their Sissy Sauce for my ribs and brisket.  It is wonderful.  It has just the right amount of heat for me.  They also have a spicier sauce, but I haven't braved it.  

As for their sides, the only one I have tried and really liked was their green chile stew.  It has a great flavor.  It seems to get hotter with every bite.  Usually by the time I finish my small cup, my mouth is on fire and my nose is running.  Worth it though, since the flavor is so good.  This place is my favorite BBQ spot in the valley."}
{"text":"Excellent Texas BBQ. Everyrhing I've had was outstanding. Brisket, sausage,chopped pork, ribs, potato salad, beans, all good."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Hate when a place first opens and everything is nice and clean all the time. BBQ sauces full with no dried on BBQ at the tip. I always say if they keep the place running like this they will do good. So this is our 5-6 time here and you can just sere rethink slowing declining right down to the customer service. To start when we went to order which was about 5pm on a Sunday we were told they were out of ribs! Really? Thought it was a joke. Lady looked at me like I was crazy when I said how does a place that only serves BBQ run out of ribs? No response not even a sorry. So couldn't order what we really wanted! Ok whatever move on. Go to the table and there filthy BBQ sauces half full at best dirty sticky bottles with the dried up BBQ sauce on the spout. I'll just stay away for a while and maybe try a ways down the road again to see if they get there act together. I know my wallet will like that!"}
{"text":"Asked my grandson how he liked his food. He responded \"yucky\" and I must agree. We ordered pork ribs, moist brisket and pulled pork. Complete waste of $29. Don't even know where to begin. The ribs were so fatty, chewy and greasy neither one of us took more than one bite. The pulled pork was just wet meat and had no flavor. The brisket was pretty much all fat. Definitely skipping this place next time I'm craving BBQ."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is terrific. Meat is cooked perfectly. The choice of sides is extensive as well. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a Texas staple and so happy it moved with me to Phoenix. Specifically, Goodyear AZ right of the highway teasing Texas Travler's on their way to California. 
Has been able to remain true to its humble TX beginnings attached to local gas stations. 
Specializing in slowly smoked brisket does not mean the rest of the menu is not up to par. On the contrary whatever you decide to indulge in will not disappoint you. The one thing you should note is the meats are served without bbq sauce. Some non TX natives find it little weird to sit at the table and smack the bottle of BBQ sauce to your liking. Rudy's sauce is like the icing on the cake. It has a twang with a little spicy hint that wraps the plethora of spices brought to perfection coating the smoked meats. And for the non spicy you can secretly use Sissy Sauce. 
Notes to first timers, no plates only wax paper, napkins on the wall, grab all the condiments you'd like and don't forget the pickles and onions. The troth is for hand washing. Meats are ordered by the pound and bread is always free. Course don't forget to top it off with a BigRed as you sit in the long picnic table between strangers who are for that moment in time your family. Ask for the moist brisket it's the tastiest cut. And lastly the insiders secret. Don't know what to get. Ask the cashier for a sample of all or whatever you can't decide on the samples are always free and very normal to ask. Ya'll enjoy."}
{"text":"I grew up in Oklahoma so I was raised on amazing BBQ. Think Texas or Kansas style, or a combination of the two. Since moving to Arizona I've had a very difficult time finding BBQ that meets up to my standards... Congratulations to Rudy's for being the first!

I ordered the moist (AKA fatty) brisket, and the jalapeno sausage. The meat was full of flavor, moist as promised, and without a hint of artificial smoke flavoring.  I tried the Rudy's beans and the potato salad on the side; the beans were great, but the potato salad was just OK. To be fair, I'm extremely picky about potato salad. For desert, the banana pudding and the peach cobbler made me feel like I was back home.

A couple of tips:

*Servings are family style so go with at least one friend, or have a huge appetite.
*Beer and drinks are served in a bucket, and your food is served in a basket.
*There will be families with kids, so be prepared for all that comes with that.
*Rudy's provides everything you need to take your left-overs, and everything reheats well.

It's great to know that I can have great BBQ more often than when I go back home to see family! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. All the meat is sold by the pound. So the ribs being mostly bone wasn't such a great deal but the lean chop was good. The sauce is either spicy or mild. You order at the front and they pull your meat and sides right there. You also can choose white or wheat bread with the meat. Staff was awesome, they give you samples and explain all the meat options. When we visit Goodyear again we will be going back."}
{"text":"This place was good,  the taste of food was more 3 stars but the staff made it a 4. If this is your first time here I recommend eating here.  They explain to you the cuts of meat and let you sample before you purchase. The meat was good,   were always in search of good bbq (especially since javier isn't a bbq msster). The sides were nothing special,  however javier did like the green Chile. One thing we didn't like was you wait in line and order and there is no waiter, if you decide you want something else you have to go back in that long line.  Next time we will just take the meat to go and cook our own sides at home. :)"}
{"text":"Rudy's... Rudy's... Rudy's!  That was my reference to the movie about Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, starring Sean Astin.  Which, by the way, if you have not seen it, then you should definitely go watch it!  But, I digress, as the movie has nothing to do with Rudy's Bar-B-Q...

Rudy's is just really good Texas BBQ!  A simple Yelp search will find that there is better BBQ in the Valley... but Rudy's does not include a two-hour wait and the risk that they will run out of the goods before you get to the front of the line.  So if you're in the West Valley and looking for fantastic lean and moist brisket, then hit up Rudy's!  The ribs are also very good.  Despite being a chain, I would go so far as to say that this is the best BBQ in the West Valley (or at least off of the 10 between Avondale and Buckeye, lol).

Consistent, delicious, and reliable... that's what you're craving!  Rudy's... Rudy's... Rudy's!  

*****FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"I was super excited when i found out a BBQ place was opening on this side of town. 
I have visited on two different occasions, once for lunch and once for breakfast. I enjoyed the food both time. My first visit was the lunch visit. We got the moist brisket and and some baby back ribs, plus a side of coleslaw. I really really liked the brisket. That combined with the coleslaw was awesome even though I have had better coleslaw. The ribs were also good and I liked the regular BBQ  sauce but the sissy sauce was good too. 
My next visit was breakfast. I was very surprised at how much food I got for $1.90. I went with the 4 item taco- eggs, cheese, potato and brisket. I got two tacos and could not eat them both. The second taco I had everything the same except the meat which was chop. It was a little spicier and had some BBQ sauce. I enjoyed both and next time I will try the jalape√±o sausage to refried beans or one of the other many combinations. 
Overall I really like the set up and all of the food I have tried. I'm ready to go back and try the pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"great flavor, family-styled environment, and amazingly friendly people working there -  they all made my first visit an unforgettable experience. When learned that we've never been here before, the girl helping us provided samplers and explained in great patience. My mom enjoyed celebrating Mother's Day there!"}
{"text":"My 5th time at this place and I still enjoy the \"moist brisket\" and the pulled pork. We typically don't deviate from things that we really really liked and the pulled pork and the moist brisket and even the chicken is very good. The smoke flavor of the meal was just right and to add their signature barbecue sauce was just a kicker to a great meal. It would have five stars if the prices weren't so high on the desert portion of their menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Rudy's for the first time while visiting family. We were very impressed with the staff and facility. When we arrived at the cash register to order, the man behind the counter asked if it was our first time. We both nodded our heads. He proceeded to bring out meats to try, and explained how their establishment worked. This service alone is reason enough to come back. The meats were all flavorful. I decided on the loaded baked potato with brisket and my husband got a pulled pork sandwich. Both were very filling. We also got a taste of the cobbler- delicious! Very happy to try this place. Five stars for outstanding service! We will be back."}
{"text":"It's OK for a barbecue joint it's tasty. The staff is friendly and nice. The price is a little bit pricey for what you get. You still have to stand in line and serve yourself and I preferred to sit down and be waited on if I'm going to spend $32 for dinner. The sauce is OK but I did have the regular pork ribs once instead of the baby back's and they were undercooked and tough. They need some more time to let those slow cook so that they fall off the bone properly and so that you don't have to tear them with your teeth so hard. The baby backs are excellent and the prime rib is excellent when you can get it. Other than that no problems with the place at all. As I mentioned the staff is friendly and very willing to accommodate you. If you take the food out it's a little bit messy unless they give you a shopping bag because you'll have to visit the condiments bar and and everything has to go in a plastic bag he which doesn't really tote"}
{"text":"So good! I had the turkey sandwich and my husband the brisket. We had coleslaw and potato salad. So delicious! The best thing about this place though is the BBQ sauce! I could drink it like water;) I bought a large bottle to go. I wish they would build a location in Tucson."}
{"text":"Rudy's has a feel good environment, as soon as you walk in. I believe its because of the picnic tables set up with the red checkered tablecloth, reminds me of family fun. Everything is weighed by the pound, and I love the idea! The brisket moist is so tender that it just sets in your mouth like you are  wearing a pair ferrigamo shoes on your feet! Lol! Overall great experience, just a bit crowded on the weekends, definitely better to go on the weekdays, so you can enjoy your meal a little more. :)"}
{"text":"Came in to eat some barbecue the brisket list and the sauce was a little salty but went well with the meat. Our cashier didn't very good job so I'm giving her some samples and explaining the process of ordering with them. The coleslaw was crunchy and potato salad tasted good.

Will be back to get more barbecue in the future."}
{"text":"Love, love, love!  

Have tried many menu items.  My favorite is the jalapeno sausage.  The breakfast tacos are awesome.  Staff is super friendly!  Great place"}
{"text":"Not terrible but not any means special either.  

The greeter was about the only sincere person in the joint who seemed interested in making sure we learned the lay of the land and how the process unfolds.  Beyond that, associates were happy to treat folks like they were quickly just herding cattle.  A 'manager type' doing some office work on a table nearby was on her cell phone and occasionally looked up over her glasses at guests, but absolutely no life otherwise from her. An associate stocking drinks lids made folks hang around while he finished stocking vs. letting folks get their lids and be on their way.  

It was Black Friday lunch time and I was looking forward to a chicken BBQ sandwich.  I was denied, they only offer chicken on a bone.  I wanted a light sandwich considering the heavy eats the day before.  Despite my fridge holding pounds of turkey, I ended up with a turkey sandwich.  My regret immediately sat in when I realized my only condiments for my sandwich was commercial packaged mayo, cut onions and pickles or BBQ sauce. The sides were pre-packaged coleslaw mix swimming in mayo, potatoes swimming in mayo, beans or 'new potatoes' which is steamed red potatoes but then swimming in butter. 

My husband liked the brisket.  Any repeat business will be from him for the occasional lunch because I can land mediocre food and service anywhere else."}
{"text":"OMG the line is outrageous at least 50 peeps and they're still coming I guess the spring training crowd is here also!  I've never been here before but everyone in here is raving about the food! I had take out cutters choice brisket, pulled pork and I got the half chicken soooo good tender and fall off the nine deliciousness! Prices are good! I recommend this place if you love BBQ!!"}
{"text":"We are a serious BBQ loving family. We were really looking forward to having a great BBQ restaurant in the West Valley. We finally have one! This place was terrific. We tried the brisket, turkey, chicken, ribs, sausage, and several of the sides. Everything was perfect. We only wished they had corn bread and mac-n-cheese on the menu. Guess you can't have everything. Service was great and fast even though the place was packed and the line out the door. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants good Texas BBQ."}
{"text":"Delicious. If you love BBQ, you can't go wrong!! Lots of choices and the sauce is boss!! I love the moist brisket."}
{"text":"Rudy's isn't the best barbecue you'll ever eat, but this Texas chain is probably the best chain barbecue in the nation.  The first time I ate at a Rudy's was actually the original store in the Hill Country down by San Antonio.  My wife said, \"There's no way I'm eating barbecue from a gas station.\"  I pulled in anyways and told her I'd take her wherever she wanted to go after I got my order.  After walking in, she ate there too.  This chain has excellent grub and damn good sauce.  I bought a bottle of that sauce to send to my buddy in Idaho today."}
{"text":"This is the best chain restaurant BBQ I've ever had.  The brisket is spot on (and that's what Texas BBQ is all about) and the sides are excellent. The layout is typical of Texas BBQ joints and the line usually moves along pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Good food, and you get it fast. Lines tend to move a little slow but that's cause people can't decide on what to get."}
{"text":"The food is ok I guess. But c'mon, how hard is it to have fries or tater tots on the menu?!?!? Potato Salad or weird boiled potatoes is all they offer? Lame!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat breakfast, lunch & dinner
& chandler chamber go getter leads group that is awesome"}
{"text":"'Ello chaps!

Blaze my saddles and let's giddyup! It was like a thirsty man seeing a mirage, only to see the mirage was real! That was me seeing Rudy's in Phoenix. 

Good ol' Texas style BBQ. I can dig it. If you've never been to Rudy's, then damn boy, you're missing out. They have an assortment of beverages (and alcohol!) to choose from. 

Brisket and sides galore and pools of sauces. Pig out and enjoy yourself. This is the best BBQ West of the Mississippi. Hell, it may be better than most of the BBQ East of the Mississippi too."}
{"text":"I love the relaxed atmosphere and excellent food. It is quick and inexpensive, but still very tasty. I would say it's pretty authentic Texas-style bbq (my mom is from TX). I liked how quick it was to get food. It was kind of on the loud side, which I actually prefer, just in case my babies get loud. Also, great place to have a beer & watch the local NFL games on Sunday. 
The only suggestion I would make is to add draft beer. They have a decent bottle selection, but draft is so much better!"}
{"text":"I first tried this place in Austin, TX back in '03 because we had an office there. Been a fan ever since. I have noticed they have become somewhat of a nationwide chain but continue to deliver a predictable product, albeit at an elevated price....lately I've stepped away from the brisket and gravitated towards ribs and pulled pork. The Pork spare ribs are a current fav....
I always skip the bread and grab a pile of pickled veggies instead. Their original sause is very good...I've never tried the sissy sause, must be sweet or lacking pepper I suspect. Anyway, expect to spend about $15-$20 and feel stuffed. One thing to note is they sell by the pound but the menu shows 1/2Lb choices....you can alter these to 1/4 or whatever you want....remember 1Lb of meat with sides is quite filling....now get your 'Que on!"}
{"text":"I loove Rudy's. It is a staple food item in my South Texas town. I was so happy to find out there was a Rudy's in AZ. It's also super close to IKEA (5 min drive), which is the reason I go to PHX 95% of the time. 

The quality is just as good as the Texan counterpart. The lean brisket is flavorful and the chicken is juicy. You almost don't need the sauce but it's so delicious so why not?! My favorite: a 1:1 mixture of both of their sauces. Trust. 

All food orders are given with all you can eat white bread. You can also request wheat, for the bbq amateurs out there. White bread is part of the experience people!

Highly recommend this little piece of Texas in Arizona."}
{"text":"Yummy barbque and way better than Joe's fyi!  This is our second time here and we got the beef brisket and ribs and they are D-lish!  Nice and tender n juicy n tasty.  The beef brisket had a bit of smoke to it but that was cut down using honey barbque sauce.  Our first time we had a sampler of meat which also had the turkey breast and it was very nice and flavorful.  I was impressed after being so disappointed by Joe's B Q in Gilbert where my meat was beyong being able to chew and dry, so if your one of those people who says Joe's the bomb.. check out Rudy's cuz your missing something!"}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing here to rant or rave about in my humble opinion. Been here multiple times just to make sure it was consistent. And it's not! First time I came I got the moist brisket. yummy, barky, moist. Melts in your mouth delicious. Second time I came, it was nothing but fat and hints of yummy flavored meat. Third time was not the charm as I got nasty dry, flavorless brisket. As I continue to crave BBQ I do stop in here from time to time. Definitely hit or miss. Sometime this brisket is awesome, but 7 times out of 10 it's just ok. I honestly really don't like the BBQ sauce either.I don't know why but it's getting worse and worse
And the value is lacking cause BBQ is is usually pricey when it's top notch. It's a bbq chain, I'll stay away and go other bbq places like Texas smoke house bbq and little miss bbq. Porkopolis Is great too."}
{"text":"One of the best places around town that offers quick carry out and customized breakfast tacos. We have been dozens of times over the past few years and it's always a pleasant experience. The food is fresh, tasty and hot. The customer service is excellent and the dining area is very simple and clean."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and this place had many options we do not have.  Overall one of the top 5 Rudy's I have been to but where is the gas station?  These are gas station restaurants!"}
{"text":"What a nice find--True TEXAS BBQ!!!  We placed a to-go order for our family visiting from out of town.  We ordered at the restaurant since we were new and needed recommendations, but probably preferred to do online or over the phone.  Also \"pre-ordering\" will probably guarantee ordered items not to be 86ed.  We placed the order for 12 people, about $150 total, food was excellent, wonderfully packaged, and provided all utensils. What a class act.  We had plenty of food and left overs.  Next time we are all in AZ, this will be our go to take-out.  Here's the down-low:

Meats: Rich brisket, tangy dry rubbed ribs, juicy pulled pork & shredded BBQ-beef, and my fav, length wise cut sausage!!!  So good!!

Sides: pickles, pickled peppers & carrots, creamy potato salad, sweet cole slaw, corn on the cobb w/ melted butter, spiced-BBQ beans, sliced bread, a gallon of fresh tea & sliced lemons and a jar of BBQ sauce.

Utensils: thick picnic table designed napkins, strong cutlery, serving tongs (worth washing and reusing), sturdy disposable plates, plenty of extra travel sized BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I've tried just about every meat on the menu and all were good but none were great in my mind. I am picky when it comes to BBQ. The service was awesome though and I liked the inside. I also liked the bar with self serve pickles, jalape√±os etc. I've been twice so far and both experiences were the same. The price was right I thought and quite a bit less than some BBQ places I've been. Give Rudy's a shot if you haven't been."}
{"text":"A meat (chicken) and a side (the potato) is nearly $13 without a drink. I advised that my potato was cold and the manager said \"I'd get you another one but it will be cold too\". Whaaa? The chicken is $7 for one small edible piece of breast and then a waste on other fatty bits of the chicken. Used to come here often, won't be back, cold and overpriced. If you find yourself in San Antonio, the original Rudy's rocks."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!! The most tender meats!! The staff is really friendly and helpful.  My husband and I were first time guests so they let us sample every single meat they had before we chose anything!  

My only complaint is the line is sooooo long it seriously is ridiculous but it does move very fast.  Just don't go during your lunch break when you have limited time! Also- slim pickings as far as sides go.  I wish they offered more greens and some macaroni and cheese would be nice."}
{"text":"I had a pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty good. My main draw back was just how greasy it is. I know some people find grease make things better but that just not my cup of tea. The restaurant atmosphere is really casual and fun... Seems like a good family place."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom..yummers. Ate here 2 times so far and I think it's really really good. The BBQ is really tasty and I liked the jalape√±o sausage! The BBQ sauce is da bomb yo. Try it!"}
{"text":"Love Rudy's BBQ. Not only do they have amazing BBQ and side options but if you are in the mood for a BBQ breakfast burrito they have them. On weekends the burritos go fast, but they are worth it. I love the regular sausage with the Sissy BBQ Sauce. My hubby loves the brisket. We have also had the chicken and pulled pork. All are amazing. The best side they have is the creamed corn (food group of its own and amazing) and my new second favorite the smoked baked potato. I love the open seating and homey atmosphere they provide. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend them. There take-out is great too."}
{"text":"It was my first time there...we just stopped in on a whim. The customer service was awesome! We were explained how the ordering works and offered samples of a few meats so we could decide what to order. We ordered the smoked turkey, moist brisket and pulled pork. Everything was delicious! I especially enjoyed the pulled Pork! It wasn't dry like most places I've had...it had TONS of flavors even without putting on any sauce! The dining area is pretty cool also. We'll be back for sure! I wish it wasn't so far from where I live in Glendale!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Rudy's.  The bbq chicken melts in your mouth, the peach cobbler was fabulous.  Excellent bbq sauce with a choice of \"spicy\" and \"sissy\".  Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"This time around I tried the loaded Baked Potato with prime brisket. It comes with a huge smoked Potato sour cream shredded cheddar and topped with your choice of meat. This is all I had to order as it was plenty to eat. I love the open environment here and everyone is always so friendly if its your first time here make sure to tell them and you are allowed to sample their main meats. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying I've had the Rudy's BBQ in Texas on several occasions and it's the greatest thing in the world. Naturally when I found this one in AZ I was completely obsessed and insisted on getting my entire family together to eat here so they could experience the Rudy's I've long raved about. We places our orders and we were VERY disappointed. The brisket I so remembered in Austin Texas tasted nothing like it did in AZ. It was super fatty and gross. Not even the famous creamed corn that I long for tasted the same. I almost cried when I left that's how disappointed I was. It was so bad that I still can't get my family to try it again praying it was a fluke :("}
{"text":"It's no coincidence that we ended up at 2 different Arizona Rudy's locations in a matter of 24 hours. When I heard my FAVORITE BBQ joint from Texas  opened up locations in the Phoenix area, my Mom and I hopped in the car for a 5 hour Rudy's Roadtrip Weekend!  Rudy's has always been my favorite for their brisket and creamed corn. They also offer Texas beers (Shiner) so you can channel your inner-Texan.  This is a neat spot for lunch/dinner because the ambiance makes it seem like you're in Texas. Crossing my fingers they'll open locations in CA soon."}
{"text":"Let's talk about BBQ. If you're looking for some amazing brisket,  Rudy's is the place to go. I usually order the \"Moist\" brisket. The flavor is better than any other brisket I've had. I always get the creamed corn- sweet and delicious! Love the ambiance and \"Texas-y\" feel. I used to frequent the Rudy's in Austin, and can say that the vibe at this location is pretty close to the real deal out in Texas."}
{"text":"I Like this place. I really enjoy the green chili stew. I usually have the moist brisket. I tried the prime rib, but did not find this method of preparation to be good. fun family atmosphere. I will continue to dine here."}
{"text":"Love this place. I think I'm addicted  have only tried the brisket so far. It comes two different ways: either lean or moist. They were both great but I must say I did like the moist a bit better. I don't really care for the large tables and wish they had smaller bottles of BBQ sauce at the tables (would probably be easier to hold). 2nd time I came here I just ordered to go. Will definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"If you grew up eating at Rudy's in Texas, as I did at my fav in Boerne, then you'll be disappointed with the food at this Rudy's. The sausage was nowhere near as good as the sausages Rudy's serve up in Texas, it was dry and flavorless. The brisket was on par, but the bread was dry. Couldn't try the chicken because they were all out by 2 pm on Easter Sunday but being it was a holiday, I won't dock them points. The sauce is still outstanding though."}
{"text":"I am from Texas and I am sooooooooooo happy they opened a Rudy's here!  The brisket is mouth-watering and the beans and potato salad are delicious.  The employees will give you small tastes of any kind of meat you want and you can order by the pound, half pound, quarter pound, whatever.  And they will give you unlimited white bread to eat with your meat (unhealthy? heck yes, but it tastes so good and like comfort food).  I really want to go here right now...."}
{"text":"If the meat had a little bit more flavor better sides and a totally different barbecue sauce I think it would be a great place to eat i"}
{"text":"So happy/elated/amazed that Rudy's has finally arrived in AZ. 

The Brisket!  

Rudy's is why I bought a professional smoker to try to get my brisket fix.  Rudy's is where I go whenever I travel to Texas. Rudy's is what all other bbq places try to achieve when it comes to brisket.

Yes, you should always, always, always get the brisket...ahhh-mazing!

Went here on day two and everything was perfect...I got there right when it opened and was still about the 50th person thru the line. Felt kinda bad for the 100+ people in line when I left...at least it isn't 115 outside yet for those last 40 or so that were in the line wrapped around outside.

AZ is going to love Rudy's...wish I had the money to open my own."}
{"text":"We went to Rudy's when our Seattle friend came back and told us about this Texas BBQ place.  After a quick car ride and nearly an hour-wait standing in line, we had ourselves some delicious BBQ!

The line during dinner time is ridiculously crazy but it moved at a pretty fast pace.  Long dining tables and plenty of seats made the fear of having to stand and eat non-existent.  I ordered 1/2lb of moist brisket with a potato salad side and banana pudding for dessert.  Yum!  That brisket was pure fatty goodness and I probably should've ordered it lean but hey.  No regrets!  Barbequed meat done right doesn't need sauce but I found myself making a tiny brisket sandwich with the bread and some BBQ sauce.  The potato salad was good but nothing to write home about.  I also got to steal some of my friend's three-bean salad which seemed like it would have helped cut through the fat better than my creamy potato salad.  I love chick peas!  The banana pudding made me want to dance though.  It was the perfect ending to such a rich meal.  I was a happy happy girl.

While I'm no BBQ expert, I enjoyed my dinner at Rudy's and I'd definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Being from Kansas City, arguably the mecca for championship bbq, we came in with low expectations, but an open mind. We knew it would be \"Texas Style BBQ,\" and we prepared ourselves for something different. With that said, we were fairly impressed! 

The customer service is great, first of all. They have a \"greeter\" that will orient you to the menu and make suggestions based on your tastes. The meats we tried/ordered, the lean brisket, moist brisket, sausage, turkey and pulled pork, all had a decent, slightly smokey, lightly flavored taste. The bark on the brisket, both varieties, was a very pleasant surprise! The sauce, or \"sause,\" was okay. A bit too much celery seed and tang for me, personally.

Overall, it was good enough to conquer a Kansas City girl's barbecue craving, and those are high marks!"}
{"text":"BBQ, sides, and several loads of bread. I had been craving BBQ for awhile and had a coworker suggest the place. I know I went a bit over board getting a few pounds of food, but that's how it's served here. Delicious pulled pork and brisket! Absolutely amazing and they give you all the cheap sliced bread you can eat. So I ended up with a bunch of different combinations of sliders. They have the BBQ sauce on the tables and a small bar with extra accruements. Pickle slices, raw onion, hot peppers, and other little items can keep changing how you experience the BBQ!

The ambience is what I expected. A cross between sports bar like things everywhere and a mess hall. And I love it. I went here to eat a lot of good BBQ. That's what I got and that's what I'll go back for!"}
{"text":"this is my second time visiting this establishment. The first time the pulled pork was terrible, super wet and just plain bad. This time I had the brisket and the pork ribs. The brisket was actually decent. Better than some places I've been to in Arizona. However the ribs were some of the worst I've ever had. Extremely dry, old like they were left over from yesterday. Also we had zero smoke flavor or really any flavor at all. I don't believe they rub the meat before smoking it"}
{"text":"Love this place. Our friends have been telling us to go for months. Finally we get one on the west side  (we still drove here from glendale) So glad we made the trip.  I got the spicy BBQ as a sandwich and it was perfect. Gf got the turkey and it was amazing! Not dry at all. Their BBQ is on point for sure. I also got the peach cobbler and it was super good. I don't really even like peach cobbler that much but our friends were saying we had to get it and I'm glad we did. The staff was very nice and really friendly. Took their time and weren't annoyed with taking the time to explain everything to us. Jalepeno's were the perfect temp too. Awesome food, awesome staff = we'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a well oiled machine lined with fat people all over the place.  The food here is pretty good.  I'm all about the BBQ sauce.  It was good but nothing spectacular.  Great place to eat before you head to the airport."}
{"text":"Tried the prime rib today, was 1/2 fat and such.  Very nice employee got a second serving and said next time you can order trimmed for less fat!  Mom picked this place for Mother's Day and her sandwich and potato salad were awesome!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I work pretty close, so I go for lunch with some teammates every once in a while. Tasty BBQ for good prices. Friendly service and fun environment, too! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town! I don't really eat a whole lot of meat, it's not something I crave very often. I've even been known to say, \"I'm not a fan of BBQ\" but I've now been to Rudy's three times in a week and half. Amazing food, quick and easy, and always greeted with a smile! And just an FYI - The green chile stew is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot! I love the experience and the BBQ is top notch!!!"}
{"text":"Waste of money. Not real BBQ food. Was so disappointed in the quality of meat they used and just left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This place is always good. The only thing is I have eaten and felt eh about was their turkey."}
{"text":"Their food is really delicious.  I would give it 5 stars were it by for the constant line. I don't like waiting in line 30 minutes-would rather sit at a table and wait. I know it's their \"thing\" and all but I just really hate lines. We have been three times since it opened and waited all three times. Won't stop us from going back but there will def be times I choose something else because of it!"}
{"text":"Been here 2 times. The 1st time it was amazing. The 2nd time not so good the food was made different then the 1st time. Maybe different cooks. But it was just 2 times. I woud give it another shot."}
{"text":"Havent had better moist brisket and the sauce, sause, was amazingly good with good heat. Prime rib good, turkey good, baby back rib good,and potato salad a hit and sweet tea was good and fresh. Wish I could eat here every week. oh myyyyyyy"}
{"text":"Yeaaaa! Yummmm!

This Texas girl does enjoy brisket and BBQ sauce, so I am super happy that there's a Rudy's in the Phoenix area.

There's often a line when you go in, but use the time to get familiar with the menu. You can order half pound portions of meat, pick up sides in the fridge by the counter, and grab a beer or other bottled beverage (soda, water, etc.) while standing in line.

Personally, I like getting a brisket sandwich. I usually skip sides since they're just OK and the brisket is more than enough to fill me up. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. The brisket isn't too fatty, the buns are fresh, and the smoky flavor of delicious goodness is awesome.

I like picking up jalapenos and onions before pouring BBQ sauce over my sandwich. If you don't like spicy BBQ sauce, use the sissy version. Regular has a nice little kick if that's what you're into.

Overall, super good. Give Rudy's a go!"}
{"text":"Rudys never disappoints. Texas or Arizona its amazing. The meat is always good, we prefer the brisket moist over lean. Tried the green chili soup for the first time. We love that the meat is dry and u ass the sause. The pork ribs were sooo good they didnt even need sause. Our 2 year old ate 2.  Love this bbq cant save enough good things"}
{"text":"if you are in Chandler AZ and want BBQ, look no further. right off the 10 on chandler blvd you'll find Rudy's BBQ.  YUM! Get anything from brisket to chicken, LARGE portions.  sauce can be a bit spicy so there is \"sissy sauce\" available if you cannot hang.  everything is pretty much self serve so you're on your own there.  Potatoes are delish!"}
{"text":"Walked in the smell was great , however standing in line to get food than to sit at picnic tables or what have you, no not gonna do that, I won't stand in line to get my own food and pay as much as I would have to pay than to sit at a community table with a bunch of strangers , if I wanted to wait inline I can go to Arby's 


Terrible."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and can't stand the inconsistentcy of their meat. Most of the time it's been smoked for to long and the staff isn't very friendly. I know you're serving me dead cattle, but I don't wish to be treated like one. Never going again."}
{"text":"Garbage...poor excuse for Texas style bbq. This review is based solely on the food. The building is nice and the staff friendly. The food on the other hand is bad. If really smokey, dry, and bland bbq is what they are going for they sure nailed it. The wife and I had the pork ribs, moist brisket, sausage and pulled pork. What a disappointment. The moist brisket is usually a favorite at a good bbq place but here that tasty fat is inedible. Dry and tasteless...this is the kind of bbq that is made as a vehicle for their sauce. Very disappointed as I was led to believe the food would be descent from friends of ours.

If you want real Texas style bbq, drive down to Phoenix and try Little Miss Bbq. Beware though...you may just get spoiled."}
{"text":"I was told a manager would call me back AND wrote them on FB and no reply to speak about our experience which was negative when our large party went last week. Food is great, customer service is not."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito YUM. Brisket, jalape√±o sausage, potatoes, cheese (no eggs for me). LOVE."}
{"text":"My friend, who is a native Texan, invited me to try Rudy's BBQ.  He told me it was the closest thing to real Texan BBQ.  As I started walking into the restaurant, I heard some country music.  I knew that at least the ambiance going in would be authentic.

You start off your journey by picking up a beer.  I recommend the Shiner Bock IPA or original Shiner Bock.  You can choose assortment of meats and sides.  If it is your first time or if you want to sample something, they will give plenty to try out.  I highly recommend their jalapeno sausage and pork loins.  When you are done, you can ask for bread and make a little sandwich with whatever items you picked out.  Lastly, you have an area where you can pick up your condiments and sauces.  The BBQ sauce here is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great service, unique bbq sauce that I love and feel is top notch and breakfast tacos

Boy I wish we had them in NC!!"}
{"text":"The moist briskets were good but unfortunately, a few after hours after eating, my friends and I got bad stomach aches. One of our friends got the stomach flu :( for this I have to give 2 stars."}
{"text":"If you love and appreciate BBQ, there is no way you can not love this food! Of course it was a Texan that turned me onto it but this girl is hooked! I have been a few times now and it never disappoints. 

My favorite slabs of meats are the moist brisket, the smoked turkey, and the jalepeno sausage. The best sides are the creamed corn (the best I have ever had) and the Green Chile Stew - unforgettable; the flavors are off the charts!

I had this with a PBR, togggled between the mild and spicy bbq sauce and was in a full food coma before I hit the door."}
{"text":"When I'm working on the west side, my last task is to stop at Rudy's on my way home.
One of the best sandwiches around is their brisket. A good helping of tender, smoky beef on a soft burger style bun.
A half lb. of baby backs, and half a sausage, along with a black cherry soda and a brisket sandwich for my wife, and I'm back on the freeway.
Been satisfied 10 times so far. Helpful counter service makes it easy."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ. The cream corn is an absolute must. We were new timers and the staff took time to welcome us & explain how to order. We were furnished samples of everything hot. It all was excellent but decided on the pulled pork which was hot, juicy, well seasoned & smoked just right.  We certainly will return."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are amazing and cheap. The \"texas toast\" aka a slice of Wonder Bread is pretty lame buuut the BBQ meat, sauce and sides are all delicious. friendly staff as well"}
{"text":"I love BBQ and Rudy's - you have my number. Every single time I visit, the place is studded with men on their lunch breaks. I'm not complaining here, but this girl loves your food too! My favorite is your moist brisket done perfectly with crispy little ends. That and your ribs, smoked turkey, and chicken and I'm in heaven. Don't let me forget to mention that creamy corn you serve up with the meats. That is tummy-tickling goodness. The set-up here is super easy to navigate as you meander back and forth through the line past the bottled beverages - good beers and sodas to choose from. Step up to the counter and order your meats and sides and they hand it all to you in a wooden crate. You and your party may now sit wherever you darn well please - my son and I love to sit on the patio. Best BBQ in the Chandler/Tempe area so far!"}
{"text":"OK, time to update my review because this place has grown on me. I still wish that they would use plates (even paper plates would do) instead of doing the whole butcher paper thing just because they are trying to be cute. Regardless, they have some pretty tasty barbeque and a decent beer selection. They are so close to our house my husband and I stop by every once in a while and have not been disappointed with the food (even though I do still prefer Andrew's). My favorite is the lean brisket with their spicy bbq sauce. I really wish they had cornbread but their baby potatoes make a pretty good side dish.

Last summer my hubby's nephew held his graduation dinner here. I was wishing that he would have chosen someplace a little nicer but it actually worked out great because everyone could order what they wanted without fights over the check at the end of the night. The manager reserved the private room for us even though we were only a group of about 25 so we could have easily sat in the main restaurant. But it was nice to have the privacy. They even let us bring in an ice cream cake and kept it in the freezer for us until after the meal. Everyone who works here is pretty friendly but the service that night was above and beyond so I had to give them 4 stars for that."}
{"text":"i love rudys and have been going there since i was a little girl, but this specific location is not put together well... came in for breakfast on a sunday at 9 am and had a 20-25 min wait for breakfast. clearly someone was not on their game which resulted in us finding somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Same great BBQ that I experienced at Rudy's in San Antonio. Best brisket I have ever had. I highly recommend it. Awesome side dishes. My son had the Prime Rib and was very impressed. Banana pudding is great for dessert. I will definitely be back each time I am in Phoenix on business."}
{"text":"Everyone I know that has been to Rudy's raves about it and I finally got the chance to see why. I skipped breakfast and dealt with a growling stomach on an early drive from Flagstaff so I could save my appetite for this BBQ. My god was it worth it. I was wondering how the heck their brisket would be any good if it's smoked ahead (I assumed it would be dry if it had been smoked ahead and was left sitting)but to my pleasant surprise it was very moist and delicious. Their jalapeno sausage is to die for and I loved the pulled pork and ribs. I really like how big the place is and how convenient it is knowing that the food is ready, you just say how much you want. Perfect in my situation as I was hung-over and ready to eat! Can't wait to go back. Some of the best BBQ I have ever had."}
{"text":"One word: Awesome.  This was our first trip here and that can always be a little intimidating. We had no idea what to order or how things worked. The cashier took the time to explain things to us and provided us with samples. Try before you buy, what a concept! 

So a little info. Everything is a la carte and sold by weight. I ordered 1/4 pound of the moist brisket and the original sausage. We got sides of potato salad and coleslaw. Oh, almost forgot, banana pudding. They place everything into a cool crate and it's open seating. They also had bar with other sides including pickles, tomato peppers, jalape√±os, etc. Two tasty sauces are on the tables. One a little more spicy and one more vinegary. Both tasty. I prefer the Sissy sauce (more vinegary). 

Everything was tasty. Including the sides. Potato salad was great. I'm addicted to the cherry peppers. We will definitely be back. Great place to take big groups and friends."}
{"text":"Great bbq, fun atmosphere and reasonable prices.

Bring friends and family. Rudy's is ideal for groups, with loads of menu items ordered by size and a large dining room full of long picnic tables. 

Everyone's certain to leave satisfied and talking about their next visit."}
{"text":"Ok, this isn't my first rodeo at Rudy's.  Because I travel a lot, I 've been to Rudy's throughout Texas and New Mexico, so going to the new location in Chandler certainly saves me a lot of driving if I develop a hankering for Rudy's.

Now having said the above let me tell you a couple of things I like about the Chandler location.  

First, and I've already mentioned, it's in Chandler so now I don't have to go to Texas or New Mexico.  

Next, they have onions and pickles for free.  Now that may not seem like much, but the Rudy's in San Antonio (3 locations) and the one by Texas Motor Speedway don't give them away...they cost extra.  Again, doesn't seem like a big deal, but I really like pickles and onions with my BBQ, being able to get what I want without having to pay for it is kind of nice.  As an aside the two locations in El Paso and ABQ offer free pickles and onions.  I'm not hung up on this issue, but it speaks to consistency in my book.

So now some things I didn't like or at least have a question about.  

First, every Rudy's I've been to has large stacks of wood to stoke their smokers.  The first time I went to Rudy's (too many people there so I didn't eat) I noticed the wood stack was down to a couple of logs.   So question comes to mine...how are they stoking the smoker?  Or are they?  Are they serving food from a central kitchen?  I don't know, and to be honest, I didn't pay enough attention to how the Chandler location is set up.  Having said that, every other Rudy's I've ever been to you can clearly see the cutters pull the meat out of the smoker.  So bottom line here, not really complaining here, just making an observation which I'll need to do further research on to clear up.

Ok, so on the day I did eat here, the food was good, but frankly food I've had at other Rudy's location was better.  Right now I'm attributing this difference to the fact that this is still a new restaurant so I'm not going to hold it against them.

When we ate there we ordered sausage, brisket, cream corn and potato salad.  So potato salad as always was adequate...not good, not bad...just adequate.  As for the cream corn, this is one of my favorite Rudy's dishes.  Not bad.  Cream wasn't fully set and it was a little bland, but overall still good.  Brisket was ok.  I ordered it moist, but probably should have ordered lean (I make the same mistake every time).  Finally, the sausage...my favorite...and the reason I want those aforementioned pickles and onions.  Not bad but the cutters mixed my order and I got a combination of regular and spicy sausage...I wanted regular.  I attribute this error to this being a new restaurant...so I forgive them for now.

So over all very good.  Will certainly go back"}
{"text":"I was craving american bbq for 2 days while visiting Arizona and came across this place on yelp. As walking in the place, they definitely noticed we never been their before.  One of the employees was kind enough to explain how the process works. Everything is individually bought drinks, sides, main dish etc.  For people who never been their before or whoever, they offer free samples of each of their meats which I thought was pretty cool. All their meats are  either bought per pound or as a sandwich. We ended up ordering a side of potato salad which was great and my mom and I both ordered a pulled pork sandwich.  The pork was very tender, actually all the samples were great. I would come back next time I am in AZ."}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ I've ever had. This tops the spots on Texas and some of the notable ones in California. We ordered the pulled pork, pork ribs, and the MOIST brisket ( you have the option of lean, moist and cutters choice) perfect amount of char on the brisket, nice smoke ring and super tender. We waited close to 45 minutes in line to order. I would have waited another 45 this place was so good."}
{"text":"Good food. My favorite is the spicy chop. Lots of good sides. If you feel like some hearty eating then swing by this place."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Stopped here while In AZ to watch the Angels play and they were fantastic. Super friendly and the food was delicious. I'll definitely be back every spring training!"}
{"text":"We decided to try out Rudy's last night, hoping the lines wouldn't be too long since it was still 107F outside.  We lucked out!  There were only about ten people in front of us, so we felt we scored!  

I am a big fan of Texas BBQ, namely beef ribs and brisket.  I usually go for the lean brisket and light to no sauce (in true TX form).  

Last night we ordered the moist brisket ($12.98/lb), coleslaw and a turkey sandwich ($4.99) for DD.

With three fountain drinks, the price was about $21.  DH also went back and got the banana pudding and the chocolate pudding for DD and himself.  I think he spent about $6 on that.

THE FOOD:  The brisket was DELICIOUS.  It was perfectly smoked and not too fatty for my tastes.  It had a good amount of char on the outer edges, which is my favorite.  The meat stood alone on its own.  Very good sign!  I did try both the Sissy Sauce and the BBQ Sauce.  The BBQ sauce was quite good.  

The turkey was smoked, which is not my favorite, but it was pretty good.  DD ate it after making me remove the \"black edges\" off and getting her two slices of bread instead of the bun it came on.  That was fine with me because I put my brisket on the bun with some BBQ sauce and I was a happy camper.

The coleslaw was good.  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  It was crunchy and a little reminiscent of the KFC coleslaw, tbh.  

We were disappointed that they did not have any mac n cheese.  Mac n Cheese goes great with brisket!!!

DESSERTS: The chocolate pudding was yummy and had an oreo cookie crust at the bottom.  

The banana pudding was just okay.  A friend of mine gave me a recipe for banana pudding years ago that is really simple and appears to use the same ingredients, but is far superior.  I wonder if I should share it with Rudy's?!  

Overall, we will definitely get Rudy's again.  However, we will probably just order the brisket to go.  We can make the sides for a lot less and I am sure DD would prefer something other than the turkey for dinner.  

Yes, that's right, will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good BBQ. Coming from a Kansas City native who loves good bbq , it's a good complement. I love the counter service and the people behind there are always friendly. My boyfriend and i usually do family style getting a little of this and that. Turkey is really good and brisket is usually and food choice. Their Bbq sauce has a nice tangy to it to. My only complaint would be the sides are a little lacking in salt and pepper but easy fix at the table and the coleslaw needs some buttermilk or more vinager or something. 
Place is defiantly one of my favs though love the atmosphere and the food is good"}
{"text":"Happy to see Rudy's opening a restaurant in AZ, visited the one in Albuquerque and this is so new and clean. Like the casual atmosphere with sitting on benches, butcher paper and checker table cloth. The prime rib is a big surprise on how good it is, have to order the moist brisket which is so tender, corn on the cob which they pour a ladle of butter on before they put it on your trey. The peach cobbler has to have it served with ice cream also. Overall experience will bring us back again"}
{"text":"My poor 8 year old is extremely sick with food poisoning after eating Rudy's last night :(.. Out of the group of people 4 had brisket, 1 had prime rib, & the sick child had baby back ribs. Poor guy! It's the saddest thing to see :(
I called & talked to a manager today, no apology, no empathy,  just give me your info, do you have your receipt,  & I'll have the \"home office\" contact you. What a sad response, experience, & day. BTW no one ever contacted me from the home office."}
{"text":"Super happy to find a Rudy's outside of Austin (where they are always one of the first places I head to when I land - the other being Schlotzskys). Love the brisket. Plenty of parking and lots of room inside. I like the ambiance. Wish I was traveling to Phoenix more often just to have a reason to go to Chandler to visit Rudy's."}
{"text":"Finally got around to going to this place, after getting recommendations from Texans everywhere.  Very family friendly.  Picnic benches, you get to sit next to strangers-type.  You wait in line, get your food and go sit down.  On Friday night when I got there at 6 there were 10 people in line.  When the rest of my party got there at 7 (YES, 7!!!!!), there were 40 people in line, which meant another hour wait for my food.
But here's the deal, the food was good.  As grumpy as I was when I finally got it, I really enjoyed it.  Well...the meats.  The sides, blah.  My favorite was the moist brisket.  No need to order anything else.  The pulled pork was ok, as well as the sausages.  But no comparison with the brisket.
So it was a good experience despite the extra long wait, and then having to put up with 5 super cranky kids.  All in all, i didn't end up killing anybody, so it was a good day :)"}
