{"text":"Wow, this place was fantastic. I didn't know bbq could be this good this far north. Their brisket sandwich was amazing and I'm eager to go back and try something else! A must go to if you have a bbq craving."}
{"text":"Ok I travel all over and eat lots of BBQ! This place is below average at best.... suggestion is for the owner to visit a few BBQ places in other parts of the country and revisit what BBQ is really about. YES! THE BBQ is  quality if you have nothing to compair to. STAFF WAS VERY FRIENDLY! Thank you."}
{"text":"I've had BBQ all over the country but the sauce here is my kind of flavor. The meat is so tender and juicy it hardly needs sauce, but the sauce is so good I have to get an extra cup on the side! All the sides are tasty so you can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"I just returned from picking up our takeout with my son, and I have to say the experience was some of the worst service I've experienced in Madison.  When I called to order the server was almost reluctant to give me the balance, and then abruptly hung up.  

When my son and I arrived at the restaurant we had three servers pass us, ignore us, and then waited 2 minutes for a server to get off the phone before asking us what we wanted, as if it was an inconvenience.  I am a single mother and was trying to buy something as a Memorial Day indulgence but not break the bank.  The amount of food we received for the 1/3 slab and pulled pork sandwich was laughable.  If you are going to charge $15 for that, then at least have the decency to provide good sides and in something larger than a condiment cup that the Mexican place down the road uses for their sour cream.  

 I am not sure how people rate this place so highly; my suspicion is that the meat is very well done, while the rest of the business languishes.  I have eaten all over the world and in any international city this business would fail.  

We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I take my BBQ seriously and because of that I researched on-line via Yelp and other sites various reviews of BBQ places in Madison, finally deciding on Smoky Jon's No 1 B-B-Q.  Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab.  Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama.  Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well.  I then arrived about a half hour later.  There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong.  They had given my order to the man before me and I had his.  Apparently we both had the same first name.  Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star.  So the counter lady tells me she'll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64.66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough.  Should have been 1/2 that.  I told her and she couldn't understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her.  She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem.  Now I was getting irritated.  She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge.  I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve.  Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon.

So I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab.  From the first taste I was not impressed.  I've had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago.  Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don't get it.  Almost every other place I've eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place.  The \"sugar-fried\" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again).  The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far.  The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe.  So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn't look like pork either.  I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included.  Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn't need since I bought a whole bottle.  So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect.  And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either.  I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience.

I strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you'll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I'll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ.

Oh well..."}
{"text":"This is pretty good bbq for madison, but that doesn't say that much.
I haven't been everywhere in town, but honestly I think Famous Dave's is better.

Basically its decent food, but if you've had real bbq somewhere like memphis, kansas city, st. louis, or anywhere south of wisconsin,  you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Having returned from a BBQ binge in Kansas City a few months ago, we decided we'd get ribs in celebration of the Royals making the playoffs. Then winning the pennant. And then again for Game 7 of the World Series. So we've had Smoky Jon's ribs and pork shoulder three times in three weeks.

Here's what's excellent: The pork shoulder and the sauce are fantastic. Right up there with the best there is. Just yummy.

Here's what's not: Extremely inconsistent ribs. (I completely agree with another reviewer regarding the membrane... it really ought to be removed, every time.Not doing so is laziness by the pitmaster.)

For us, Batch #1 was pretty good -- not KC level, but totally fine. Batch #2 really was KC level... just excellent--tender, juicy ribs, clean bones, very nice. Food heaven. Batch #3 was terrible -- dry meat, thick membrane, difficult to even cut into 3-rib chunks. There's no way what we received could have ever won an award from anyone.

So after spending about $165 here in the last three weeks, I can't recommend it. Hey, ribs ain't cheap (and that's fine), but it's hard to justify if the quality isn't even close. I realize there will always be slight variations...that's what makes BBQ great. But the incredible inconsistency here kills it for me."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good but if when they say open until 9:00pm they mean 8:30pm. Called to place order at 8:30pm and I was told they are not taking calls. So if you're going to order Carrie out you should call at 8:00pm."}
{"text":"Platter for 1 satisfied my hubby, he is so picky. The baked beans were some of the better beans we've had. The pickles were like grandma made.  The BBQ chicken & ribs were tasty. I liked the grilled pineapple side.  Our only negative comment would be we had to wait a while for server to bring more ice tea. They were very busy.  Generous portions"}
{"text":"Smoky Jon's is some of the best BBQ I've had in Madison.  However, I haven't tried many places, so that's not saying much.  I really enjoy the ribs and the pork shoulder sandwich.  The brisket is good as well.  I have found all the barbecued menu items to be flavorful and tender.  The burgers aren't that good, however; they're overdone and greasy.

The sides also leave something to be desired.  I've never had a bad side dish, but I've only really been impressed by the fried biscuits.  The mashed potatoes are runner-up.  The pasta salad and potato salad are both well below average.

Service at Smoky Jon's is both quick and friendly.  Employees will remember you, which is always nice.  The prices are good.  The location is a little iffy, though; the parking lot is too small and the building itself can feel cramped.

All problems aside, I will keep coming here for the delicious BBQ."}
{"text":"Great ribs and pulled pork. Love the staff. Just don't plan on a leisurely dinner/lunch, the dining area is tiny and they will kick you out when your done to make room for others. Good to go options for a quick, delusions dinner. The fried sugar balls are awesome, love the spicy corn, Mac n cheese yum! Very cheesy, beans - good. Skip the salad, was just lettuce the last time I ordered it as a side. Face it, there is no way this mean is healthy so go with it and treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Good food, great bbq sauce. Our dinner came out very quickly. Staff was friendly, restaurant clean. Will go back again soon."}
{"text":"After a nice shopping day at the East Towne Mall my boyfriend and I had to satisfy our craving for bbq and I am so glad we found this cute, aromatic place that really made us drool once we open the door...

Between our hunger and the so many good choices they have it was hard to decide what we wanted to order, but we finally ended up having a half slab of ribs, a brisket sandwich and for the sides, cole slaw, baked beans, corn and fries.

Let me tell you....every first bite was like mmmmm....mmmmmmmm.....mmmmmmm, we loved everything, the ribs were tender with the right amount of sauce on top (a glorious tangy sweet marriage between my palate and that sauce), The brisket was really good with a little bit of fat  ;) the slaw was creamy and mildly sweet, the corn had a smoky garlicky flavor I enjoyed a lot, the beans were also smoky, sweet and to my surprise they had a nice kick of spiciness (but not too spicy), the fries were ok.  The only thing I didn't like too much was the bread for the sandwich, it was soft but a little bit dry, I think a more moistured bread would be better. However; that is a minor thing, that would not stop me from coming back again, I used to live in Austin, Texas and this place reminded me of those bbq places I miss, thank God I would not miss them too much anymore ;)"}
{"text":"Decent portions for the price, and deliciously sweet and tangy sauce! Most of the reviews on here indicate the sauce is very polarizing, but I found it delicious. The pulled pork sandwich was not bad, but when I added the sauce, I thought that the sandwich became excellent. Slightly spicy, smoky, sweet, tangy-- a little bit of everything! Very pleasantly surprised.

The ribs were pretty solid as well. Not \"fall off the bone\" by any means-- I don't think they necessarily stand up to most places in Memphis, St. Louis, KC, or Phil's out in San Diego, but for Madison-- they are the best I've found. Good for a barbecue fix for sure.

As for the sides, as many have noted, the portions are laughably tiny. I think I got 1/2 cup of baked beans as my side. They tasted really good, but were gone in four bites. The hot sugar biscuits are great. Little funnel cakes is essentially what they are. 

Overall, for Madison, I was really pleased. Tasty pulled pork and ribs, excellent sauce, divey BBQ ambience, and reasonable prices. I'll be back when my next BBQ craving hits."}
{"text":"Well this is a tough one. A few years back, I stopped going to SJ'sbecause I was sick of getting rubbery non tender ribs. In the 90's, you could always count on getting the BEST ribs around, EVERY time. I think that the fact that Jon worked there then made the difference. Since he retired, I dont know what happened exactly? However, recently I stopped in for a shoulder platter, and everything was great, so go figure. The sauce is fantastic, and when done well, this place is something special."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for awhile because I was not impressed with the BBQ meat. I understand they're known for their sauces, but I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce so I will not comment because I don't have enough experience to differentiate between good and bad sauces. 

I decided to give Smoky Jon's another try with hopes that my previous experiences were not normal. I have to admit, it is still the same. The ribs are over cooked. I like tender fall-off-the-bone ribs but these were over cooked to the point my 1/2 slab of ribs seemed more like 1/2 slab of pulled pork. I want to be able to hold the rib with my hands and bite it off the bone. Every time I pulled a rib all I got was a bone with no meat on it. The fries and mac-n-cheese sides were both salty. 

I'm not sure if they smoke their meats but I couldn't taste any wood smoke (may have been covered by the sauce). I always assumed that when you eat at a BBQ joint that smokes their meats, you would leave smelling like smoked meat. I didn't smell any wood smoke inside or outside. 

If you like BBQ sauce, then this may be your spot. I'm still searching for good BBQ meat in Madison."}
{"text":"Ok...I'll start off by saying I'm a F.I.B. from Peoria IL. If you don't think this is some of the best bbq you've ever had?...you're out of your fraggin mind!!!...We have some good bbq spots in IL. ...Very good...I've only found one place that rivals this gem...point blank...This is the best bbq you're going to find in Mad Town...I say that because I frequent a lot and have had it more than three times...high five excellent!!!...best bbq you're gonna find here!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in Madison.  There are no challengers.  Comparing this to Famous Daves is like comparing a Caribou Burger to MacDonalds.  Not to say that MacDonalds/Famous Daves are necessarily BAD, but this is unique, delicious BBQ that wins best in Madison year in and year out for a reason.  The service is generally solid, and having travelled in rural LA a LOT, I can't believe anyone who frequents the southern Miss, Lousiana area to be surprised that a place is closed on Monday.  The pork shoulder sandwich is the #1 item."}
{"text":"We tried to go to this place on a Monday; oops, not open. After 10 months of living in the Madison area, we have found THE RIB PLACE. The ribs are great, so is the brisket, the corn, beans...you get the idea. The restaurant is a little small but the service was amazing. Watching my family eat was almost as good as the food, almost. I highly recommend Smoky Jon's #1 BBQ."}
{"text":"The ribs, you must try them! My major mistake was getting a 1/3 slab."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Smokey Jons.  It is a new favorite for sure.  The space was small but cozy, and the food definitely deserves best in Madison (or the universe).  Patanne (the lovely lady who took our order) was friendly and made us feel right at home.  We will be back."}
{"text":"WwoOOW!  It is really that good here!  If u don't stop u are missing out BIG TIME!  Great food!"}
{"text":"Smoky Jon's catered our wedding.  Smoky Jon's as an entity is a really great thing.  The food was delicious.  Everyone said it was the best wedding food they've ever had..  The staff (restaurant and catering) were wonderful.  They were in and out at our wedding in a snap.  Five stars for sure!  

However, working with Smoky Jon himself is difficult to say the least.  Half way through the planning, my fiance had to take over all communications with him because I couldn't handle it.   Some examples: After sending in the deposit, he asked us to up our wedding head count since this is a \"small\" job for him.  Note:  We estimated 175 people  When our final count came in 10 people under predicted, we had to argue with him to get the contracted price.  He requested that we either pay in cash or a money order ahead of time.  When scheduled a very specific time to do so, he was late.  The day of, he claimed that we \"screwed\" him over by serving an additional 40 people.  (This was not the case)  Of course, he didn't say this directly to us, a friend overheard him say this in the parking lot as he was leaving our wedding among other things.  When confronted about this, he denied it all.  And this was all after my husband's speech about how awesome the food was.  

In summary, they arrived on time, served delicious food, packed up leftovers and left it clean.  The only negative was dealing with Smoky Jon himself.  If we had known what we were getting into, we would have looked elsewhere for catering options.  

Now it's comical to us and a great story.  But during the wedding planning process, it was a pretty big stress.  

We'll still eat at the restaurant.  The BBQ is awesome.  Just proceed with caution if you use them as your caterer."}
{"text":"Great pulled pork, bbq sauce so good you could drink it!  Totally going back here!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Can't believe i drove by it a million times and never went. Best ribs!!"}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time and wow I can't believe I have overlooked it for so many years!  We tried all the hot items, the beef brisket, pork shoulder, and the ribs. I'd highly recommend all of them. Even if you are eating alone-you deserve it. This is America-Treat yo' self!

As a man who loves attending the local barbecues I can say this place is BBQ to the core. If you are serious about barbecue you best get over here. After one visit, I already plan to stop in or get takeout whenever I drive by the airport.



Side note: I love Famous Dave's Barbecue, but saying Smoky Jon's is inferior in anyway is laughable. The only reason I will ever again choose Famous Dave's over Smoky Jon's is because I am not in Madison.

Secondary note: you can pick up their sauce at Woodman's to put on everything."}
{"text":"Smoky Jon's has been on my list for a while since a lot of people say/rate it as the best barbecue in Madison. We came here on a Thursday night and it was fairly empty. I loved the kitschy decorations with all their awards and accolades on the walls.
You order at the counter from their large board of meat and side options (you get two sides with every platter/combo dish) 

We decided on the:
Half rack pork ribs
Smoked chopped beef brisket sandwich 
Coleslaw 
Mac and cheese 
Pasta salad

The hostess was really nice about us taking a while to make up our minds and the food came out really quickly.

It might have been because we went in on the later side, but the ribs we got were pretty much inedible on the ends because they were so dry and crunchy. The ribs in the middle were great (and very generously sauced), I just wish they all would have been that tasty.

I really enjoyed the beef brisket sandwich- the meat was tasty and they give you a cup full of their famous BBQ sauce so you can drench it to your heart's desire.

In terms of sides I enjoyed the coleslaw as a counter to the sauce and meat but it wasn't anything special. The pasta salad was very creamy and the mac and cheese was also extremely cheese-y.

All in all it was a fun and tasty experience but it didn't quite live up to my extremely high expectations."}
{"text":"Really bad service worst attitude i've seen. the two girls at the counter should learn how to smile. 

Ribs where really bad totally overcooked and the sauce was really sweet

Maybe this place is good for Madison Wisconsin but it's not good for people that travels far to eat good barbecue. 

Even though the sauce is really bad if you want the hot sauce, that will set you back another five dollars since they don't have it for the restaurant you need to buy the whole jar. 

Beware they serve Pepsi not Cocacola 

Not worth it"}
{"text":"I love this BBQ. The price is low to moderate depending on what you order. If you are just getting a sandwich combo, the cost is below $10 (which includes two sides) but if you get the ribs (and I would highly suggest you do) the cost gets more moderate. 

I always order the BBQ pulled pork sandwich combo with fries and slaw, sometimes with a 1/3 slab of ribs added on if I'm super starving. The pork is tender and juicy, and the BBQ sauce they have is very unique and has a little kick to it (in a good way.) My husband always gets the beef brisket sandwich, which is by far the best brisket we've ever tasted. I have no idea how they get it so tender. I like the casual dining atmosphere, nothing fancy, just great BBQ. 

This is the only place I will go for BBQ in Madison now. It beats Chili's, Outback, TX Roadhouse, Dickies, and even the Great Dane. By far my favorite."}
{"text":"Finally got to Smoky Jon's for the first time yesterday. The brisket sandwich was delicious and I am pretty sure I would eat a flip-flop if it was drenched in their BBQ sauce.

Looking forward to going back for the ribs and chopped pork."}
{"text":"I was very excited as I entered and saw all the plaques and trophies. I ordered the ribs and brisket expecting I'd order again. I was somewhat disappointed after my first bite. The sauce was a bit too sweet and the meat kinda dry. I was hoping this is going to be my barbecue place in Madison but I guess I have to keep on looking."}
{"text":"EDIT - REPLY TO SMOKY JON - ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW

Hi Jon,

This is the same canned reply you leave for all of your negative reviews (yep, read them all), and it shows the same cavalier attitude as your bbq.... In reading through all of the reviews, the one thing noticed is that the vast majority of positive reviews are unable to compare to bbq eaten in the known meccas of this country, while the negative reviews have many comparisons to KC, Texas, S Carolina, etc, etc.....  you know, the people that have been around and actually do KNOW what it is they are APPRECIATING.
Knowing that you HAVE won numerous awards in these very places, you would think that you wouldn't fall back on the review rating of those that don't know any better. No slam, I didn't know bbq from bratwurst until I started traveling either, but maybe it would be best to show WI what good bbq is, and not high-five yourself for being better than burgers and brats off the old Weber.... as my review stated, your place does have the potential to do that.
So, while respecting your opinion as well, I still must disagree with you, and have offered all of the actual reasons for doing so. In the end, it's your business, run it how you will - just don't point at awards for sauces you don't offer, years of experience when it's not you at the pit, and a canned reply to those of us that know bbq stating we must not know how to appreciate it..... 
Also - my original review had everything in it regarding how to raise your food up to my, and many others, standards. Fix those issues, and I'll give it another shot. 

Best Regards,

Caleb


Hi Caleb,

Thanks for your feedback, I respect your opinion but I must disagree with you. As you can see on the other reviews and by the awards we have won, our BBQ has great quality and taste. Also, we've been on the market for over 25 years, which makes us a great BBQ tradition for those who know how to appreciate it. Please contact me next time you visit us and we'll make sure our food is up to your standards.

Best,
Jon Olson 

ORIGINAL REVIEW

I'm not sure why this place has 4 stars - was some of the worst bbq (with potential, will explain after I complain) that I've had. I also get that this IS Wisconsin, and bbq has a whole different meaning than in the bbq meccas around the nation, but damn....

Ordered 1/2 rack w 1/2 chicken, 1/3 rack w pork shoulder sandwich, and 1/3 rack w brisket sandwich. Sides of baked beans, mashed potatoes, and mac-n-cheese. So, pretty good variety of what they offer. 

The bad:

- membrane not removed from ribs - trying to eat meat stuck to a huge piece of essentially dried and smoked skin as the bones are pulled apart is pretty gross. Any pitmaster or fan of bbq knows this needs to be removed prior to smoking, any other explanation boils down to plain laziness. Fully half of the meat was stuck to the membrane as it fell off the bones. And a star is lost!
- chicken was smoked beyond merely dry - think chicken jerkey. And a star is lost!
- both sandwiches were minced meat to the point of being indistinguishable from one another in both taste and appearance. Where are the slices of brisket and juicy chunks/shreds of pork? Not here. And a star is lost!
- only one bbq sauce is offered standard, the only other flavor (same sauce, only spicier) has to be ordered separately and at extra cost. Sides were very small (about 2oz) and nothing extraordinary - mac-n-cheese was somehow \"flour-ey\" with overcooked noodles. Can't imagine what end piece of corn with 5 kernels I would have received had I ordered that. And a star is lost!

The \"potential\":

The taste of the ribs was not bad, the chicken as well. I think if the \"pitmaster\" was given a raise and some training, or given the boot and replaced with someone qualified to run the pit, the food could be brought to par. I also think it's not to much to ask for a wider variety of sauces - where are the sauces that all of the newspaper clippings on the walls referencing Smoky Jon's contest awards at? Quit being cheap with the sides. I like taters, more than 5 bites please!! Hook up the mac with some cheese!! I support small businesses and love bbq, give me a reason to!!

The \"good\":

Staff is friendly. Most of the food had good flavor, but fell way short on the prep/handling end. Place was very clean and smelled delicious."}
{"text":"Yow, this place is good.  Like many who have posted here, I am a connoisseur.  When ordering ribs I always hedge my bet with some brisket, or something, in case the ribs aren't \"fall-off-the-bone\" (which is the only way I like them).  Here, I did that, but it surely wasn't necessary.  Ribs were great, and my \"hedge\" - a brisket sandwich that came in a combo with a 1/3 slab of ribs - was awesome, too.  2 small suggestions I would make for Jon would be: (1) have @ least 2 (maybe 3) varieties of sauce, on the \"tanginess\" scale; and (2) serve everything with pickles - nothing goes wit bbq better than a little pickle either with, or between, bites!"}
{"text":"We went there on 03/04/2016 around 4:30.  We were greeted by a very friendly young woman; she was the best part of the experience.  The ribs were very dry and the sides were very small. You will not get great value here.  We were the only people in the restaurant and parking was still a problem here.  We only saw two spots total  in their lot, one of which was a handicap spot.  We did find parking on a side street, but not real convenient.  The friendly service is probably not enough to get us back for another visit."}
{"text":"Love the sauce, corn, fries, everything I've tried!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been here before! I've been missing out! The food is excellent. Portions are huge, so you won't be going home hungry. The atmosphere in the restaurant is down home and cozy. You order at the counter and then sit at a table with a checkered tablecloth until they bring it out to you. Which they do very quickly. The sauce here definitely deserves the awards won. My one complaint is the $4 split fee. My boyfriend and I came here for date night and ordered a half rack of ribs half chicken combo for $23, but then were charged $4 to split it. If we had ordered two separate meals (one ribs, one chicken, two sides) it would have cost $27, which is the same as the combo + split fee, so not a big deal, but that's my point. Getting the combo is not a deal in any way. Why even have a combo option if you're going to charge the same for it?  Plus, it's pretty unreasonable to think one person could eat all of that food  (it comes with 2 sides), so they are obviously intended for two people. All in all, date night for under $30 is still awesome and we left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"Another restaurant I went to purely on Yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed. If you showed me photos of Smoky Jon's, handed me a review, and even gave me some sample BBQ; I still wouldn't have believed this place existed in Madison. Jon's feels lifted straight out of another state, further to the South, and full of BBQ. 

Their \"In\" door and wood corral will lead you straight to the counter to order. Take your food with you and follow the rails and the trail of framed BBQ awards to the \"Out\" door. Or sit down at one of the dozen 2-top tables with red checkered cloths. Short ribs, brisket, turkey, and chicken all come with enough sauce to cause heart problems. The ample sides of mashed potatoes, coleslaw, brown beans, and sweet bread won't help your health either. But it will taste good."}
{"text":"It was quite a satisfying experience being able to really enjoy Jon's ribs. This were the best ribs I have had at a restaurant so far is thus deserving of 5 stars.

The bbq sauce was peppery and delicious though, as others have mentions, it would be nice to a have a little variety with the inclusion of another sauce or two to scramble the tastebuds up.

As a side note, the sides (see what I did there:) ) were very respectable. Most the BBQ joints I've stopped by have horrible side entries but at Jon's they don't appear to have been neglected.

On the downside, I wasn't a fan of the chopped pork and brisket. They were a bit bland. Regardless, the ribs wayyy outweighed that downside.

Thank Jon! I highly recommend folks to swing by and grab some ribs. Try their takeout, the deals seem to be quite good!"}
{"text":"Ribs are an absolute 5-Star rating! Unfortunately everything else was mediocre, thus the 3 star review. Between my son and I we had ribs, chicken (not that great), with sides of beans & corn, which neither of us cared for. I'd like to come back and try their brisket. I'll definitely return for the ribs if nothing else."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Smoky Jon's a couple of times over the last few years. Their BBQ sauce is fantastic, their chili is great (when in season), and their beans are delicious.

Unfortunately I find their meat to be kind of bland, if very tender -- this has been consistent across all of my visits, trying ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. 

Policies regarding customers can be strange. On our latest visit, my girlfriend and I were going to be charged a $4 plate splitting fee for sharing a meal at lunch... There was no combination of additional sides that would abate this fee, only the purchase of a second full meal. We opted for take-out."}
{"text":"The service hasn't gotten any better here.  Still the best ribs in town but the attitude of some of the staff is still a problem.  

Walked in at 8:31.  Nice employee #1 started to take my order   Bad employee #2 walked up and asked me if i was dining in tonight?   I said yes.   She says I can't let you do that, the dining room closed at 8:30.

So officially I was in the wrong but it was the attitude and smirk on her face that was maddening.   

I feel sorry for these businesses that have to try and make money with these kind of employees.  

#dontbeaminutelate!"}
{"text":"I've had BBQ in the Carolinas, St. Louis, and San Diego (Phil's), and I can honestly say that Smoky Jon's is the best I've ever had!!  It is a must have anytime you are near Madison."}
{"text":"The best!  They have been around a long time and have thrived when other rib places come and go. I make the long trip across town when I need a half-slab."}

{"text":"Just hellllllll yeah!!!
This is good, good, good!!!!!!
Ribs, briscut, garlic mashed potatoes, onion rings.
This meal was fine as frog hair!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"On the hole the food was every well done and tasted good. Very fast turn out for a carry out order. But a lack in service. I ordered a big bbq plate didn't get 1/3 rack with my order and when i called to clear up the situation all i got was a \"ah shucks sorry\" and \"will take your number down and someone will get to you in 48 hour.\"

So good food for what I got but make sure to check your carry out orders before you leave the parking lot."}
{"text":"As usual, I'm pretty divided on my review here. It's certainly better than 3-stars, but not quite 4.

The service is fantastic. I went around 3pm and they were fast, friendly, and accurate with my order. The price wasn't bad at all either.

I ordered the pork sandwich, with a half-rack of ribs, cole slaw, and potato salad. The dinner combos come with a roll too.

The roll was good, but absolutely generic. Then again, you don't care about the roll, and neither do I.

The sides were solid. Nothing overly great, but no complaints at all. The coleslaw improved with pepper for sure.

The pork sandwich was a great choice. I don't mean to brag, but I'm pretty proud of my decision. It was lightly seasoned, with a great smoke flavor and managed to be both moist and have texture at the same time. It came sauceless, but the sauce was a definitive addition.

Speaking of sauce, let's move on to the ribs. (Sure, the segue was awkward, but you'll see how it works out.)
The rib meat was awesome. Great smokey aspect to them, crisp edges, tender meat, and pull off the bone with not too much pressure at all. The meat alone would've made this review much better.

So, what's the issue? Great question.

The ribs come out smothered in sauce. Not Kansas City-style, but just doused in it. The sauce is great. It's heavily peppered, which can seem overpowering, but in moderation is a great addition. The sauce bath knocked the ribs way down, both in flavor and enjoy-ability, which is a real shame considering how good the meat was."}
{"text":"I had my doubts - this far north, right by the airport....my 1 and 1/2 trip to Madison left just enuf time to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The quantity and quality were good. I hD a pulled pork sandwich with beans and slaw. 

The meat is cooked and shredded and served with out sauce. It was tender and not mushy or greasy. I would like a bit more heat or edge   

The sauce was good. Sweet and tangy and flavorful. I used almost the whole container. Order more if u are a sauce fan. The cole slaw was tasty but just a little to soupy or creamy. 

The beans were tasty. They had a nice subtle molasses background. 
The motif is casual country. Come prepared to spill sauce and juice on yourself, your dining mates or your car."}
{"text":"Yeah, for realz... all the awards, accolades, etc., are spot on. Best ribs I can remember having in a very, very, very long time - perhaps ever. I especially liked the end portions of the slab that somehow dodged the sauce and were on the  tougher side (think jerky). That alone was fantastic. Unfortunately, much like the Cookie Monster now says that cookies are sometimes food, these delicious ribs are sometimes food too. Every now and then though, I might have my Cookie Monster moment where sometimes is NOW!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, but the ribs and chicken were overcooked and dry.  The sauce is very good, just was too bad that everything was so dry.  Texas Roadhouse has them beat."}
{"text":"BBQ: Great! Picture on the outside of the building of a pig eating his own ribs: Disturbing!"}
{"text":"Got an order of 1/2 rack ribs and two shredded pork shoulder sandwiches. The price felt a little steep at $31 before tip. However, good BBQ is hard to find in this town and these meats are worth the price tag.

The Ribs had a crispy skin and the meat was seasoned through and through, fall of the bone tender. They really excels with their highly addictive sauce and the blend used to coat the ribs is truly a winner.  There's a nice mix of peppery BBQ sauce coating, bits of onion, and cooked-in sauce flavor that makes for thoroughly flavorful pork.

The sandwiches are served dry, with the sauce on the side. It's tempting not to dunk your entire sandwich in it, not because it's dry but because the sauce compliments the meat so well.

You get to choose two sides, which were aplenty. The dinner bun that came with the rib plate was unremarkable, as are the sandwich buns. But really, you don't come here for the bread.

Their dining area closes 1/2 hour before closing time, so make sure you have ample time to indulge!"}
{"text":"I have gone to Smoky Jon's for lunch or dinner, and I've ordered take-out in bulk for parties, and the food has never been anything but fantastic.  The BBQ is awesome, the ribs are amazing, the sides are delicious.  The dining room is very small, so sometimes you may have trouble finding a place to sit, but that's the only drawback to this otherwise terrific restaurant.  Chains like Famous Dave's are fine, but if you want to support a locally-owned business that really treats its customers right, and get better food besides, I can't recommend Smoky Jon's highly enough."}
{"text":"Really, really good. Had not known what to expect as we hadn't been there before. We stopped on the way home after a weekend out of town. Not too much seating, which was fine for us as we were getting take-out. 

My husband had the chicken and I had the ribs. His was a bit dry, but the ribs were fall of the bone delicious! We will definitely be back again, and will likely order way too much just so we have leftovers!"}
{"text":"Jon's place is good quality BBQ and I can see why it gets the following, but I would agree with a few that have said it's not the best they have had.  I how ever can see why many have said it's great.  Madison lacks good BBQ so it was refreshing to see a place putting out nice Ribs, Brisket, Sausage and Chicken. I especially liked the ribs, but found the sauce a little spicy for the Brisket.  I'd like to try a sweeter sauce on the Brisket sandwich, but their original sauce pairs perfectly with the ribs.  I had three meats and all were perfectly cooked.  Part of my giving 4 stars for the size of there sides which are served in condiment cups.  Jon, please admit your side cups are small....please.  I will be back very soon for the Ribs ...see you soon."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Smoky Jon's on my first day in Madison.  I had seen stellar reviews, claiming it was the best BBQ in Madison.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.

I ordered the brisket sandwich meal with fries and a side salad.  The fries were the best thing on the plate (maybe it's because I don't have fries very often), but these fries were just okay.  The salad was just bagged romaine lettuce with dressing in a packet.  I know that brisket can be a little fatty, but my brisket was almost as much fat as meat.  The brisket had soaked through the bottom side of my bun, so I ate it - or half of it - with a fork.

I assume Smoky Jon's had an off-day when I was there because they really get great user reviews."}
{"text":"We moved to the Madison area a few years ago and have been in search of good BBQ. We live on the west side but had driven by several times and were encouraged by the positive reviews here and their 40+ years in business. 

I had the brisket and my wife had the ribs...unfortunately both were awful."}
{"text":"Food is great ...
We got the Pulled Pork Sandwich 2 sides and it was all delicious. .
Baked beans and fries were great and can't wait to try some other food on the menu. ...."}
{"text":"I gave myself an hour to eat dining in before I have to catch a plane. I ordered. I waited 45 minutes. It seemed busy and I was stupid enough to keep waiting even though I see the guy who ordered before me get his and leave 20 minutes in. I didn't have anymore time and asked them to check my order. Nope, the ticket was lost.

I was so hungry and so sad that I couldn't get any ribs. In the state of chaos that the kitchen and staff was in, there was no way they were gonna rush the order out in time even for to-go. I had to get a refund and speed to the airport. For what it's worth I don't think the 1 woman on wait staff was to blame. The owner really threw her under the bus by understaffing on a busy night. There's so many people, so many orders. There was another girl just taking orders. Just standing and waiting, while the other woman ran back and forth with bags and bags of food. What kind of restaurant is this? It's such a weird sight in a restaurant: one girl running another girl standing.  But at least I know she put my ticket into the kitchen. Someone fucked up in the kitchen; someone threw away my ticket. I will not be coming back and will not be sending any friends and family here either. For all the awards the place gets and all its years of being in business, I wish it just wasn't so amateur at being a restaurant."}
{"text":"After living in Madison for 11 years, I finally got around to eating at Smoky Jon's. I think it's pretty safe to say that it won't be that long before I come back. 

My wife and I each had the shredded pork, mine by itself and her in a sandwich. Both of us loved it. The sauce is smoky and a little spicy. We also got a side of onion rings. Those seemed to be extra greasy, but they were crispy and tasted fine. 

Only styrofoam and paper platters with plastic utensils. I think it's due to a lack of room in the back, but overall, really good!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ joint I've been to in Madison! Great north side Madison biz. I like going here for quick lunch meeting with up to 4 people. Not great for a big group."}
{"text":"The ribs were the best I have ever had. The BBQ sauce is probably the best I have had. And everything is very smokey flavored, which, for me, is a very good thing. I had a chance to also try the chicken (awesome) and brisket (decent, but not amazing). 

For the sides, I got corn and the French fries. This was surprising for me but the fries were average and the corn was unbelievable. I pretty much assume corn is corn, but not here. 

Finally, I liked the style of the place. It is a hole in the wall without man tables. I like that and recommend everyone to head there."}
{"text":"Smoky Jon's has been around a long time, I grew up in this neighborhood and can remember them being located in the side of the Eagle foods building , now Jungs garden center. Barbeque sauce flavor is a personal preference, the ribs were tender and fall off the bone and I did like the flavor! We stopped by on a busy Saturday night and ordered takeout, five minutes later it was ready! Excellent job Smoky Jon's!!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were driving from the dells back to Illinois and we were getting hungry for lunch.  We decided to skip all the fast food chains you can get anywhere and decided to let yelp tell u where to eat.  We searched high ratings in Madison and we stumbled upon Smoky Jon's. 
It did not disappoint.  It was also conviently located close to the highway. 
We ordered the ribs and brisket sandwich. The best part is the sauce. I wish I brought home a bottle of sauce. I will definately go back if I'm ever in Madison again!!"}
{"text":"Amazing ribs and sauce. The chicken is pretty good, too.

Problems are: 
-Small, relatively unimpressive sides (those mashed potatoes are definitely instant).
-They charge you for sharing! Even when my boyfriend and I were ordering take-out a la carte ribs on the phone, they asked him if he would be sharing with anyone so they could tack-on that extra $1.50! What's up with that?
-The dine-in experience (like many have already posted) isn't great, since it's so small and there's no beer.

All that said, Smoky Jon's has the best ribs in town. Trust me, I've tried every rib spot in Madison."}
{"text":"This has been on my radar for a while. See the pictures. First off this is important, when you walk in you smell smoke so I knew it was going to be good. Very woody and tons of awards and plaques etc. Thy were not as smokey as I wanted and boldly came sauced. They were fall off the bone and had that pink smoke ring on the inside. I had the half rack with beans and potato salad. The ribs were pretty good and I really liked the sauce and bought a bottle. The beans were nothing special and the potato salad was average. The beans would be great if they were smoked and hade little bits of meat in them. Sides are usually not the star and this was the case. The ribs are worth going for, my friends said this was there new BBQ place for them and they will be black. One person said the brisket sandwich was really good. Over all this is a solid BBQ rib place. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Madison! Ribs are amazing, and the fried sweet rolls melt in your mouth. They basically the best beignets I have ever had. I stop here almost every time on my way to the airport."}
{"text":"RIBS RIBS RIBS! I like me some niceeee slab of ribs, drizzled in a tangy, but slightly sweet BBQ sauce. Smoky Jon's definitely delivered!! They held  true to their many awards (nicely displayed next to their register) and I was more than content once I finished eating.

The ribs themselves were just ordinary- pretty juicy, but nothing to blow my mind. What I found amazing was the sauce and the sides!!! The corn was deliciousss, especially all dressed up in their special seasoning. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted just like the ones I usually make at home, which are pretttty darn amazing- if I should say so myself.

One downfall was that there is a $4.00 plate splitting fee (BOOOOO!). I really wanted to try the 1/2 slab + sandwich + sides combo (only like 2 bucks more than just 1/2 slab) but I knew I couldn't finish it by myself... and it just wouldnt be worth it to pay $4.00 more to share it with a friend. Hmm... or maybe, next time don't be as dumb as me and say out loud you want to share.... sneakily share it at the table!!

Anyways, Smoky Jon's was a great farewell from Madison meal for me, leaving me nice and full, the perfect prep for a long flight back to Los Angeles. 
I'd give it a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Four stars for the normal quality. Last night though got take out and the order was wrong - too far to drive back. The pork and the ribs were WAY over cooked - or better said kept hot way too long. The pork was mushy and the ribs dry and hard. I know waste in the restaurant biz is a killer but I have heard this from a couple of people now and am hoping you get back to your usual quality control. The chicken though was as perfect as ever. Don't let the quality slip!"}
{"text":"So...this is the kind of food that will kill you. So there's that. But that being said, this is the best way I can think of to take in food with absolutely no nutritional value. The ribs are sweet sticky tender meat bars. The sides are sweet sticky flavor bombs of flavor. The rolls are airy buttery balls of carbohydrates. You should get extra napkins.

I think this place is best for carryout. You can sit and eat - there are a handful of tables, but then there are also bullet holes in the windows. Since it's Madison, I'm assuming someone put them there for show, but definitely with a real gun, so anyway I'd rather eat at home.

Also, if you've been doing the House of Cards thing and want that BBQ experience but you don't live in the south, this is the closest you are going to get. So, check it out Madison, it's a little bit different but that doesn't mean it isn't fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ restaurant. The parking lot has about 10 spaces or park on the street with a good walk to the restaurant. Sauce had a small kick and the pulled pork was outstanding. If you
Like BBQ this is the place in Madison."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today, couldn't be more happy with the experience. Ribs were excellent,  service was great and very attentive.  Highly recommend Smoky Jon's and will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Wtf!!! Superb!!!! 1/2 rack w beans and Apple sauce!! In Wisconsin!! No wonder they won all the awards!! Ask for the G.A.D's!! Wish they had this in Cali!"}
{"text":"Ever since moving out to Milwaukee I've had a craving for this place. I wish I could get back to Madison a little bit more often just to make another trip to Smoky Jon's.

Walking in it's clear what your in for. Jon has rib credentials! The walls are covered in awards and certificates the guy has won. Best sauce, best ribs,  best this, best that. You don't get the awards this place has without knowing what you're doing.

I almost always get the ribs (because how can you not?). The sauce has just enough heat to really compliment the ribs. I've tried a few of the sandwiches, but I always end up coming back to the ribs because that's where this place really shines. 

The sides are also very good. The potato salad and coleslaw are my favorites. I'm also big fan of the BBQ Baked Beans. The french fries are good enough if you get takeout from Smoky's (just because they travel a bit better than something like cole slaw), but with so much other great stuff to try you are really ripping yourself off if you stick to them.

This is definitely one of my favorite places in Madtown."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review from my recent visits. The food is still amazing, however, I recently brought a friend with me to try the place out. We were not that hungry so we decided to share one of the plates since the portions are generous. I was dumbfounded to find out that we were charged $4 for an extra empty plate. No extra portions were provided. Just a straight $4 charge for a empty paper plate.

I'm not sure why this is. What if the person didn't eat? Would they be charged $4 to sit in the seat to chat? It wasn't like the place was full and they were taking the place of a paying customer.

Anyways, still love the food but I'll think twice about bringing friends now.



************************************Original Review**********************************
This place makes me miss when I used to live down in Georgia...but only for the phenomenal BBQ. Seriously though, I haven't found a place with authentic Southern BBQ this north of the Mason-Dixie Line...until NOW!

For lunch, try the sandwich platter. There's a serious amount of food and it will fill you up. Not enough you say? Ok, then go for the half-chicken with the brisket. It's enough to fill up half the Confederate army! The sauces are full of flavor and delicious!

It may look like a hole-in-the-wall but it has 5-star food!"}
{"text":"When thinking BBQ you do not think of Madison,WI.  This is the one exception to that rule.  The food here is by hands down the best BBQ in Southern Wisconsin, there is nothing on the menu that you can go wrong with.  What is even better the award winning sauce does not mask or cover bad meat but creates an even better experience.  

Seating is limited and parking is even more so, you can park on the side road (Manley St)  off of Packers Ave."}
{"text":"Great food- tried the brisket, chicken (which was huge), fried cod, and sides were good. Must eat fried sugar biscuits ASAP! So gooood (hot fried donut)."}
{"text":"Was driving by Madison and thought we'd get some BBQ.  I had the spicy chicken, which was just a chicken breast on a bun, with sauce on the side.  That was it, not even a big chicken breast? 

My wife had the turkey sandwich, which didn't appear to be anything special either.  It looked like it was from a grocery store.

Kids liked the burger and brats.

What I didn't like was the prices, sandwich platters were $8.45 each and drinks were $1.99 each.  Wasted my money on these as they don't give you a drink you can take with you and it's a plastic cup.  

What I did like was the sides, except for the one order of fried biscuit, which was raw in the middle.  Threw them out.

Last, I've never been to a BBQ place with no sauces on the table and only one served with the order.  I liked the sauce, but with all of the awards on the wall, they should offer a few options. 

Should have gotten the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Smoky Jon's is good. It's not on the same level as say Oklahoma Joe's in KC, or Bogart's in StL, or even Slows up in Detroit, but the price is right, the meat is cooked well, and the sauce has a lot of flavor. 

The ribs are good--the only ribs I've had in Madison that didn't disappoint. I know some BBQ lovers don't think ribs need sauce (similar to how some feel about steak), but I like it fine and these ones come out slathered. 

The beef brisket was top notch, grade A stuff. The mashed potatoes were a few levels below what you'll get at Brickhouse. The onion rings are heavily breaded and crunchy, just how I like them."}
{"text":"Very quaint little place.  Seats 24 people inside so if you're having a party, it's best to get it to go.  I had the 1/2 rack of Ribs platter which came with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and a side salad.  The platter was served with a roll as well.  The size of the side salad was great and it even had different lettuce types and carrot matchsticks.  The Garlic Mashed was very tasty but there wasn't a lot - perhaps a small ice cream scoop (like, tiny child size).  That's great for portion control!  The ribs were very tender and the sauce was a sweet, fruity vinegary Barbeque.  I found it overwhelming with a small bite but then as I noshed on, it was very good.  My husband got the 1/2 chicken and it was fantastic!  The chicken was moist there was a touch of char and the sauce was quite elegant with the meat.  The creamy coleslaw was quite tasty, in fact, if you're a person who loved your mom's creamy coleslaw from the 1960's (it was actually based off a Miracle Whip recipe) then this is the one for you.  Next time I return, I'm trying a sandwich, with cole slaw and the biscuits (\"tastes like a funnel cake\" says the server).  NOTE: If you share a plate there is a $4 surcharge."}
{"text":"My precious little brother has been going on about Smoky Jon's for some time now and we finally made a trip that allowed us to head on into this fabulous establishment!  I couldn't quite decide what I wanted so I went with my usual BBQ joint pick - pork sandwich!  I opted for the potato salad and beans on the side.  My entire plate of food was delicious and I'd absolutely come back again.  The only thing I didn't love was my husbands chopped beef sandwich - but, lucky for me, I went with my ol' bbq joint standby ;)"}
{"text":"Very enthusiastic and knowledgeable hostess. She knew exactly what to recommend and was on point. The ribs are a must and don't forget to try the sugar fried biscuits. Cool vibes and quaint establishment."}
{"text":"A real gem!  I don't get to Madison often but I am sure that if the next trip is near a meal time I know where I'll stop, Smoky Jon's. Recently our party of three each had a different entree, one that the host suggested after learning we were newby's. He guaranteed that we would love our choices and we all did.

The BBQ pork sandwich was generous, the pork was extremely tender, cooked just right (not dried out or raw) had a smokey tang that makes it so special. The ribs were cooked to perfection and tender meat nearly fell off each bone.Their sauce is mild and OK but I was surprised by the limited choices in that area.

They offer several sides and the ones we sampled were all above par. The place is adorned with \"Best Of\" plaques and I can see why."}
{"text":"Is this the best BBQ joint I've ever been to? No. Is it this a delicious gem on the east side of Madison? Definitely! I love the atmosphere as it is smaller and cozy inside. The awards decorate the walls and it has an awesome local feel to it. I had the chopped pork sandwich and the mac and cheese and apple sauce. The sides were good especially the cheesy mac. The chopped pork was also delicious! I loved how finely chopped it was allowing the awesome BBQ sauce to get all over the meat. I highly recommend this place and I will be back many more times."}
{"text":"Awesome hot link sandwich.  The baby back were good too and the sauce is finger licking good.  We were surprised the French fries were so good and the onion rings, although not the best I ever had, were actually very good.   Don't waste your time with the coleslaw."}
{"text":"Driven by this rib place many times, but never tried. Got a full rack of rib dinner to go and it did not disappoint. Ribs were charred with a great smoke flavor. Perfect amount of meat on bones. Sauce is a wonderful surprise with chopped up add ins, which I usually do not like, but this flavor profile was just phenomenal. Sweet and tangy with the right amount of kick. Baked beans and mash potatoes were good sides as well. Friendly service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Madison.  Hands down.  Only loses a star for consistently messing up take-out orders and not being up to par compared to places in the south."}
{"text":"Great rub on the ribs. Little to spicy sauce but, it was tasty. Mac 'n cheese is ok. Pork and brisket sandwichs are AWESOME. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Great little BBQ joint on the north end of Madison - emphasis on little. The place has perhaps a dozen tables, most only able to seat two. The decorating scheme is similar to a log cabin, with varnished wood walls and ceiling, and red checkered table clothes on the tables. The food is wonderful - the smoky aroma hits you as soon as you walk in the door. The half rack was delicious. The sauce is a traditional red, tangy and a little sweet. They also serve the sauce on the side if you order a pulled pork sandwich, which is nice."}
{"text":"BEST SWEET MEAT IN MADISON! The sauce is unique and fantastic with tiny onion pieces in it contributing a bite to the sweetness of the base with it's slight tang. The meat is prepared exactly how you'd expect--falling off the bone with a slight resistance. I'd kill for these ribs! ...I'm serious... For take out, I find the ribs to be a little under sauced. I bought a bottle of Smoky Jon's Sauce to take home to load up the ribs."}
{"text":"Absolutely Killer BBQ"}
{"text":"Drove out in hopes that Madison barbecue was not an oxymoron. Not disappointed. The ribs were very good. I would say best in Madison for ribs so far. Not Kansas City or Memphis good. But solid. Nice friendly place. Looked busy.

Sold for a return visit!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out thurs. 2 full racks of ribs. You get 2 sides with each. We got baked beans cole slaw and French frys. Everything was delicious!!  Love their sauce. Ribs were tender with a good bark and smoked flavor. I see why he gets so many awards. 
The people working were friendly and fast. 
I've had the sirloin burger several times and it's always super goood!
I want to try the chicken and Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Madison by far. The sauce is the best combination of sweet, spicy and smokey. We love coming here and ordering ribs, brisket or chopped pork sandwiches. Their sides are the best ALL of them!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family when they were visiting from out of town this weekend and we all loved it! Food was delicious, there is plenty to choose from on the menu, the prices are reasonable, and the service was great. Everyone in our party got a different menu item, and each commented on the great flavor. I ordered the cheeseburger, which is good-sized and done just right. I like that with a lot of the entrees you get to choose two sides, as in most BBQ places, if you want two sides, it's usually an additional cost. I chose fries and the mac n cheese as my sides and was not disappointed. My favorite thing about this place was their award-winning BBQ sauce, which was delicious. I like that they serve it to you with your meal, but I only wish you were able to get a bit more of it, as I liked dipping my fries in it as well. The dining area in the restaurant and parking area outside could be bigger, but the taste of the food makes up for it. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I may be a little biased since I've grown up on these ribs but damn it if these aren't great ribs I have no clue what are.  Got off the plane and the first thing on my mind is ribs.  It's right next to the airport.  Even if you are there for a layover just take a cab up the street and get yourself a full slab of pork ribs with two sides for only 20 bucks.  That's enough food for 3 people folks.  If you ain't keen on sharing with your nasty, always sick, finger licking companion(s) then they have individual meals too.  The meat is fall off the bone tender and juicy.  The bbq sauce is what I judge other sauces by.  It's vinegary and a little sweet and a whole lot of flavor.  If you are in Madison and you  crave ribs then this is the only place you should think of."}
{"text":"Went back with a close friend with a small appetite, ordered ribs we were going to split.  Told them not to split it  You can't share your food unless you pay $4.  Didn't want 2 plates or anything else.  Was charged the $4 and given the stuff anyway - house rule I'm told.  Order your food to go then just sit down and eat it, I guess.  Seriously?"}
{"text":"Horrible...ribs were overcooked and dry with way too much salt and pepper.... both the corn and mac and cheese were over seasoned.... the owner should be arrested for trying to kill people with salt and pepper"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in KCMO, so I have quite high expectations when it comes to barbeque. Smoky Jon's is not bad by any means, but it has lots of room for improvement. 

Pros:
- Smoky Jon's meats are very tender, cooked well, and taste as though they are slow-cooked/smoked. (I didn't notice a liquid smoke flavor; using liquid smoke would be cheating!) So the meats, in my opinion, are five stars.
- Mac & cheese is yummy. 
- Cute, BBQ-style restaurant atmosphere.
- Friendly service.

Cons:
- Beer-battered cod sandwich should not come with BBQ sauce -- that's weird. 
- BBQ is all about the sauce. Smoky Jon's sauce is too watery and too peppery. This was the consensus of my group of four who all agreed that the sauce was much too peppery.
- Women's bathroom really needs cleaning. A customer should not see an obvious mold ring around the water line of the toilet. The dirty bathroom also bothered me because the bathroom opens up into the dining room -- it's not down a back hallway away from food.
- Real dishes would be nice for diners dining in.

While I don't think Smoky Jon's is bad, I have experienced better BBQ before, so I can't rate beyond three stars."}
{"text":"Best Barbecue in Madison hands down. Great food and an old fashioned wood panel aesthetic. Definitely a place worth stopping if you like burgers or barbecue. The sugar fried biscuits are especially good! My only complaint is that they don't sell t-shirts. They have an awesome logo."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped here on the way to catch a flight. It was close to the airport, the outside didn't look like much, but we trusted the reviews. It was yummy! I had the chicken sandwich platter (it was more peppery than spicey, which was perfect for me) with applesauce and fries. Delicious!! Would definitely eat here if I find myself in Madison again."}
{"text":"Wow. 

1. Best beef brisket I've had in my life. 
2. Awesome, awesome ribs. 

I love BBQ and this place is the real deal. When I saw the \"no 1\" in the name of the restaurant I laughed because that's a tall glass to fill and I was prepared to tear them down on Yelp if it wasn't true, but they blew me and my taste buds away. 

I could go on, but let me put it this way: Next Monday I'm flying into Madison for work for what will likely be my last trip to WI for a while. My coworkers and I have already agreed that we're driving straight from the airport to get lunch. Now I just need to decide... ribs or brisket?

(Note, I went twice so that I could have both the ribs AND the brisket :) )"}
{"text":"Not really all that great.  Not much for your money.  I don't know when it was decided that barbeque had to be expensive like it's become, even in little dives like this.   It's OK, but don't go out of your way.  I was unimpressed.  Madison is suffering I think from some real growing pains overall.  I don't like what I see.  Average food.  Average rating.  Maybe that's even generous."}
{"text":"I am a bbq snob.....and this place met and exceeded my expectations. It is a small place but has indoor seating. Food was out quick and order was accurate.  The pork sandwich was flavourful before I added the bbq sauce. The sauce was a great balance of spicy sweet. Sides were coleslaw and baked beans. Both were excellent. Definitely worth a stop in Madison."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of devouring some Smoky Jon's bbq twice in the last two weeks. Both times I had the BBQ pulled pork, it was very, very good. The sauce was fantastic however I really only needed the 1 sauce that came with. The sugar buscuits are the best darn thing I've ate in a long time. If you go get the sugar buscuits! Prices are fair, to be honest don't order double meat is the 1 scoop is very sufficient as is one thing of sauce. I doubled up everything and some went to waste."}
{"text":"The BEST BBQ in town, hands down. The sauce is amazing and award-winning, the meat is perfectly smoked and cooked. The sides are great and wholesome. Whenever my fiancé and I want a real treat, we come here. You can even buy sauce to take home!"}
{"text":"Best QUE in Mad-Town!  Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Get there a little early for lunch because the dining area is small."}
{"text":"Got this recommendation from a friend living in Madison as the best BBQ place in Madison.  We stopped here on the way to the airport after going to a wedding in Wisconsin for the weekend.

Food: We had a couple hungry people so we got a bunch of different stuff.  

The meat: 
- Chopped Pork shoulder: I thought this was the best of the things we had.  Meat was tender and well seasoned
- Ribs and beef brisket was very good, but nothing super special stands out 
- 1/2 Roast chicken: This was just okay.  Well seasoned, but the breast came out kind of dry.

Sides: 
- Applesauce, Cole slaw, and potato salad were good, nothing special
- Corn was really well seasoned.  I loved it.

Other stuff:
- Not super hard to find, but the turnoff is somewhat sudden so keep an eye out for it and look at pics here.
- Cozy.  There wasn't too much seating inside, my guess is that it can seat 30-40 people.  So if you have a large group it might be hard to get a table"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Madison. Seriously, I dream about the food. My absolute favorite things are the half BBQ chicken dinner, the mashed potatoes, and the sugar fried biscuits. 

Do yourself a favor and go here-you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"YUM!!!!!   This place came recommended by some strangers.  OMGoodness, a must go to place when we are in Madison.  The gal behind the counter was sweet, helpful and provided great customer service.    We went home wanting to come back for more.  We had pulled pork, brisket and ribs.  And the sides were equally as great.  Went home with a bottle of the sauce."}
{"text":"It's Decent bbq. Not great, but good for a northern town. But beware you don't get the sauce he wins awards for. The ribs can be very inconsistent as they are prepared only 2 or three times a week. They can be juicy and delicious or dry and terrible. I like the sandwiches... always great and a bargain. STEAK Fries! ALWAYS FRESH... THIS IS HOW FRIES SHOULD BE DONE PEOPLE. The sauce is sweet and tangy and made with a white onion. I like it. So while it's not southern by any means, it's worth going. I can't say big Jon is pleasant, it seems like his staff turns over monthly. Also sides are tiny, but good. He has Chili in season, but very disappointing. No spice, bland. Great hamburger though. Huge."}
{"text":"One of the best eateries in the state of Wisconsin.

Best brisket, by far, that I've ever had. Absolutely amazing ribs. You don't need much more of a reason than this to visit.

Sides are hit and miss. The fries are terrific and keep well as leftovers. The fried biscuits are pretty greasy. Their baked beans used to be full of brisket and pulled pork and sauce. Now they just taste like a can of Bush's. Actually I saw them prepare the beans once by pouring a humongous can of beans into a pressure cooker. Pass. Mashed potatoes are full of pepper and quite good with their sauce. Corn is canned corn swimming in butter and red pepper flakes. A surprising yum.

They've won the national BBQ contest literally every year since the 1990s. Jon's may or may not be as good as classics in Memphis, St. Louis, or Kansas City, as some have posted here, but it's definitely the best BBQ in Wisconsin or the Chicagoland area."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ! Great price for great food! Best in Madison. I highly recommend the garlic mashed potatoes and sugar fried biscuits! I got the pulled pork and loved the sauce. Sauce was slightly sweet with a great balance of hers and spices. Service was LIGHTNING fast and extremely friendly. I wish we ha this kind of place down in Chicago!"}
{"text":"The ribs really are amazing! They fall off the bone, the meat is tender with a great crisp, and the sauce is tangy and sweet. Potato salad was also a great mix, and the corn was super flavorful! All in all, a great stop right by the airport."}
{"text":"Smoky Jon's is absolutely the best barbeque joint in Madison, bar-none. 

The ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender and cooked to perfection, but their brisket is a real treat - slightly smokey with a seasoning that compliments their barbeque sauce amazingly.  Their meats are served with your choice of all the classic barbeque joint sides that you would expect - my favorites are the beans and the coleslaw, the latter of which is rich and creamy (not oily and bland like the \"Creamy Coleslaw\" at Brickhouse).

I'm astounded by the reviewers who prefer the likes of  Brickhouse BBQ or Famous Dave's to Smoky Jon's and can only assume that they have never had real Kansas City or Texas barbeque.  If you want authentic barbeque, nothing beats Smoky Jon's."}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich, he had the ribs. Brisket was a little fatty, but I loved the bbq sauce. Baked beans were delicious!"}
{"text":"As this is LITERALLY my favorite restaurant, I can't believe it's taken me until now to review it.  I carry a bottle of Smoky Jon's sauce with me when I go to other places to eat.  That's how good it is.  The pulled pork and brisket sandwiches are excellent.  I can put down a 1/3 slab of ribs, a pulled pork sandwich and their super-excellent fries with a side of corn like it's nothing.

My only small gripe is that sometimes, after about 7:00 PM (they close at 9), the ribs seem like they can be a little over-done.  (Not as tender)

Smoky Jon's turns me into a pig, and I love every delicious mouthful."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I have ever had.  Found this place when I was looking for a place to grab dinner on a quick evening flight up from Chicago.  It's super close to the airport and the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"For Madison, this BBQ is pretty spectacular. Anywhere else and I'd give it 4 stars but, considering the location, it's damn good and deserving of 5 stars.

The food's good, the staff is friendly, and (for freshly-made BBQ) the service is usually quick."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has won awards for its BBQ. Excellent. Delicious. Great service."}
{"text":"Great barbecue. Similar to Famous Dave's but perhaps a little cheaper, and of course, locally owned. The dining room is weird, so we've only gotten take out."}
{"text":"So good!! Meat was tender and juice with a great smoke flavor, but not so much smoke that it will give me heartburn later like some do. Loved the bbq sauce, even bought a jar to take home!"}
{"text":"Update:  Went back, was in the mood for the link again so I didnt try any new proteins (next time I need to get a chicken).  I tried the garlic mashed potatoes (EXCELLENT, almost as good as my wife's) and the potato salad (too sweet and soupy).  Customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"Really good.  The chicken was amazing, moist and flavorful...not the easiest thing to smoke.  I'm certianly going back for more!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST BBQ IN MADISON! And yes, it was so good I had to use caps.

The ribs are smothered in delicious sauce and fall right off the bone. You can pick your sides. I would recommend the cole slaw and french fries. The cole slaw is nice and creamy. Mashed potatoes are another solid pick. Always get the ribs. You will be disappointed when your friends are gnawing away at their ribs and you have your little pulled pork sammie.

The checkered tablecloths and roll of paper towels on each table complete the experience."}
{"text":"Smoky Jon's rack o' ribs puts all other rib places, and places that serve ribs to shame.  The portions are ginormous and the meat is tender.  The sauce that's slathered everywhere is spicy, tangy, sweet but not disgustingly so, and smokey.  

It reminds me of sitting around a campfire roasting some damn fine meat, slathering it up in top notch BBQ sauce and then grubbin' happily. 

For sides we had baked beans, garlic mashed potatoes and dinner rolls.  However after stuffing ourselves with tons of ribs there was no room for the sides! 

We ordered out because the dining area in Smoky Jon's is teeny tiny and the parking lot is even worse.  

Truly, my only complaint was that I spent all night in the bathroom after eating here.  I think that's because my system was just not prepared for the rich, smokey, deliciousness that I have never experienced before.

So it was worth it!  YAY!!!"}
{"text":"Best ribs ever.   You can't find a better place for barbecue.  We mentioned Smoky Jons to friends from the twin cities and the next time through Madison, they remembered and stopped to indulge.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My BBQ crave kicked in and I decided to try Smoky Jon's out. It was a Saturday evening around 6-7 o'clock; the whole parking lot was empty. We walked inside the restaurant; whole restaurant was empty. I didn't know what to think but we took our chances and ordered. 

My friend and I went with the 2 1/3 slab ribs, one pulled pork sandwich, one beef brisket sandwich, corn, and beans. All this totaled out to $31 dollars; not bad at all. We sat down and immediately 10 people walked in, all ordering for carry out. There were no worries at this point, I knew the food had to be good. The food came promptly and at first sight it seemed like it wasn't much.

After 20 minutes of hardcore eating I downed my last bite of corn. My stomach was full to the point where I couldn't move; the food was delicious. 

Ribs - Fell right off the bone
Pulled pork & Beef brisket sandwich - Delicious 
BBQ Sauce on the side - Words can't describe how heavenly it tasted 

Smoky Jon's was so good the first time, we ordered carry out the second day. Smoky Jon's 2x in less than 24 hours; not a single bit of guilt. 

Overall, Smoky Jon's was great, possibly the best BBQ ever. I will for sure stop by every time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Stopped by Smoke Jon's on our way out west - a fun little oasis with great service, tasty sweet biscuits and corn, and killer BBQ sauce. We had the pork shoulder and brisket sandwiches and consider them some if the best we've ever had. So glad we stopped. This is some of the best BBQ I've ever had."}
{"text":"I have been here for about 4 times and was satisfied with the services and food until today. I wanted my wife and daughter to try the food here. We came in and ordered one 1lb burger with mac and cheese. Since there were no tables available to dine in, we decided to take them \"to go\". However as we were leaving, a few tables become available and we wanted to sit. But an employee told us that since it was two of us and we ordered only one burger we could not take any tables. It was my first time experiencing this and I was not sure if they use that excuse to make people buy more. What if a budget-limited customer comes in next time and cannot afford to buy an order for each family member? Would you kick them out? Anyways, my wife was extremely upset and disappointed. They just lost a customer and also a \"word of mouth\" from me. My wife and I are not recommending them to any of my friends anymore."}
{"text":"\"Forrest, what's going on with them damn sugar fried biscuits!\" Yes, that is what I literally heard there. This was followed by a refund on some of our meal-more on that later.

My friend is a UW student and after deciding to visit him he took us here to eat. We ordered the brisket, rib and chicken. The brisket was cut, almost chipped with a tangy/sweet sauce with a little bit of a bite at the end and little bits of onions that were chewy/crunchy. I asked the person taking my order about his recommendations for sides. He said-definitely the fries and the baked beans. The baked beans were delicious! Also sweet with a little kick at the end and then with a little sweetness to it. I just want to take the time right now to say that I hate beans-the consistency of it and the way that they're often overloaded with lard/butter. As mentioned above, yummy and on top of that he said that if I didn't like either of the sides he recommended to let him know and he would get me something else. 

I tried the ribs which were so soft that it basically came apart in my fingers, the sauce was consistent throughout. My friend placed an order of the 'doughnuts' as he called it but they were sugar fried biscuits. We waited and waited, ordered them to-go and even then they weren't ready. The counter-man, who must have been the manager then asked the unseen Forrest what was going on with the damn sugar fried biscuits and then said he was going to give back the money for the biscuits. That's really an extra step in fixing a slight problem in an otherwise small kink."}
{"text":"Four stars because this is a local business that I want to support and Jon is a great community guy and cares about is clientele.  Thanks for being a Madison institution!

If all this wasn't the case, I might take off a star.  If you've read my reviews you know I'm more about service than food.  I'm not a fussy eater and perhaps even eat my food too quickly.  I just want to be treated right and not held hostage when it comes to paying the bill at a restaurant.  None of this is an issue at Smoky Jon's.

But in this case I do take a bit of an issue with the food.  My ribs are always good (remember, I'm not fussy) but hubby has been disappointed with the brisket.  In the time it takes me to eat my 1/2 rack of ribs, he has just completed trimming the fat off of his brisket.  People have different preferences with the amount of fat in their meat and perhaps hubby is unique in this manner preferring a fatless cut of meat.  In the end, the whole experience leaves him a bit frustrated.  The sauce is also a bit too sweet for us and we choose to get it on the side so we can be in control of how much is on the meat.

One other note -- in general we prefer eat-in to carry-out and the restaurant is quite loud.  The music could stand to be turned down a bit.

We will be back, but probably not until winter when our favorite BBQ food cart closes up shop for the season."}
{"text":"Long story short...

Pork ribs are amazing. I've had ribs all over the US and the ones here compare favorably with all of them. The meat falls off of the bones and have a smoky flavor. The sauce is also quite tasty with a tinge of spices.

The beef brisket and pork shoulder are fairly average."}
{"text":"Went here tonight based on Yelp reviews!

What a great find! I drove by this place on my way to work for a YEAR and never thought to stop in. At a glance, it doesn't seem like much. Nestled(snugly) between two other buildings you can almost miss it. 

I'm so glad we stopped in! It has that true BBQ joint atmosphere- checkered cloth tables(each complete with it's own roll of paper towels), wood paneling, and Southern blues playing overhead. You order at the counter off of a big overhead wood sign, and they bring piles of saucy goodness to your table. This place is littered with awards for their barbecue. I guess the owner travels and competes(and a lot of times, wins) at national cook-offs.

I got the 1/3 slab rib and beef brisket combo. The ribs were super yummy. Flavor-full, but not too smokey. The brisket was nice too, not too fatty. I would say that the house sauce has that vinegar-like tang. It's sweet and spicy and tart all at the same time. Nice. 

My saucy side dish(aka boyfriend) ordered the turkey, which we both thought was good...but nothing amazing. The sides were really tasty too. The beans were delish, and the sugar-buns(read: fried dough dusted with confectioners' sugar) weren't too bad either.

We both left with tingling tongues, full bellies, and smiles on our faces.

* just a note--parking in the \"lot\" is super sparse and hard to navigate in and out of...the only drawback!"}
{"text":"Went here with the family last night.  Hadn't been here for about 20 years since leaving Madtown.  There were five of us and only two tables were available with four seats, so we ordered and decided to take it home.  We ordered three half slabs of ribs, one order of 1/2 chicken and an order for beef brisket.  About five minutes after ordering tables opened up so we decided to eat there.

Seating is pretty limited.  I think Smoky Jon's probably a lot of the business with carry out?  The food came out very quickly and was excellent.   Everyone liked every meal.  My wife orderedt the chicken and liked it very much but said the ribs were the best.  Great sauce.  Great baked beans and fries with the skin on.  They serve you the food in a styrofoam box with a napkin, wet wipe and plastic fork and knife.  I guess if they did more business in-house they would use regular utensils instead of plastic, but it still works.

Prices are probably normal for a rib place.  $14.95 for a half slab with two sides.  I always liked this place and after all these years it's still got good quality food.  Highly recommend it.  If it had better seating I would give it five stars."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!
It's a little out of the way, but worth the journey if you're looking for decent BBQ.
I don't remember seeing any highchairs.  We ended up bringing in our stroller for our daughter to sit in.
While you have to order your food at the counter, there is a wait staff that will bring your food to you and refill your drinks.
No alcoholic beverages... (that's why 4 stars)."}

----------------------------------------------------------------
This place is my favorite type of restaurant. Incredible, unpretentious food where you can tell that the staff care more about making people happy with their food than making a buck.

Luckily for Jon, people love his food so he gets to do both. 

I would wager pretty heavily that Smoky Jon's is the best BBQ in the Midwest and the ridiculous NATIONAL bbq awards would back me up. You will seriously be blown away by the sauce (which you can actually buy bottles of - pro-tip not great at dipping nuggets for but it is excellent for cocktail weinies!). 

The ribs are solid - especially with the sauce, but what you really need to do is to get the beef brisket. Flavor country, population you.

Also, it's super plain, but the grilled chicken sandwich with smoky jon's sauce on that tasty bun is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I was in Madison to visit with my brother and sister in law,it was suggested that we go here. Apparently my brother in law is on a first name basis here,and I understand why now.I ordered the tenderloin sandwich and 1/2 slab with spicy corn which I highly recommend. And one more thing the steak fries or skin on fries are fabulous small or large are fantastic. Great food I'm sad I live 95 miles away,or maybe this is a blessing in disguise."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ from friendly, saucy folk. The brisket was as good as any I've had in Texas and the sauce was sweet, spicy and with a little heat. They also offer a number of tempting sides (you get 2 with most everything on the menu) including a great corn, skin on fries, coleslaw, beans and deep fried biscuits that look and taste like the beignets from New Orleans.  

Parking is limited so you may need to park a block away in the neighborhood and just walk over the restaurant.

Located near the Oscar Mayer factory on Packer road.  Definitely worth a visit.  We will definitely be back when we head back to Madison in the fall."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in town. Its quaint little place. I have found that some of the best food come from these small places. This is one of those places. I will drive an hour just for the food. Great food, and great atmosphere for the price!"}
{"text":"This place is running on the fact that there really is no good BBQ in Madison. And Smoky Jon, if that is his real name, may have won a lot of awards, but he is not selling that winning BBQ at this location.

I got off a plane starving after a long business weekend and I could not eat the ribs that were served because the tips were burnt and more like chewing tobacco than ribs. I wouldn't mention the sides because that is not why you go to these places, but Jon you need to get off the beach in Cancun and work on these recipes, they ST-I-N-K."}
{"text":"When my aunt told me that this place had closed for good, I almost fainted. 

Fortunately, she was mistaken and my family and I went here to tear up some BBQ. For the price, you get a TON of delicious food! 

If you aren't into ribs, I highly recommend the brisket sandwich dinner!"}
{"text":"This local BBQ icon was on our list of dining destinations when Santi and I were planning our trip to Madison. Located nearby the airport, the well-lit, wooded interior starts with a pathway that leads to the large overhead menu, the ordering counter, and the dining area. Adding to the décor are the statewide accolades all around the walls. On this evening, the casual atmosphere happened to be unexpectedly subdued, quite unlike the other BBQ restaurants I've visited.   

We shared a Combination Meal ($17.75) that included our choice of 1/3 Slab, Smoked Pork Shoulder Sandwich, and extra serving of smoked pork shoulder, Cole Slaw, and BBQ Baked Beans. The Slab/Pork Ribs were smoky, tender, and the meat easily peeled off the bones. There was an excellent hint of smoke to deepen its flavor, and that was further enhanced by the BBQ sauce to provide a sweet higher note, strong black peppery secondary, and anchored by a noticeable spicy kick that reverberates with good hops. For the price, there wasn't enough meat on the ribs, but the flavors were still sensational. The dinner roll that this dish came with was sweet, soft, and spongy. I loved it.

The Pork Shoulder Sandwich was excellent as well. The pork shoulders were tender without one single dry spot--perfectly executed and delicious without the BBQ sauce. The meat was flavorful and deepened by its smoky flavor that coupled perfectly with the well-rounded, full-bodied spicy BBQ sauce. I absolutely loved it except for the buns that turned out flaky with hollow spots and lacking flavor. We finished the meat without getting into the buns very much. This sandwich could have been so much better with a bun of higher quality. 

The BBQ Baked Beans were smooth, sweet, and delicious. The Slaw on the other hand was too wet with a weak texture. Compared to other BBQ joints, their sides could use more varieties such as green beans, collard greens, yam and other possibilities to complement this resounding BBQ. They also have two sauces, and I wished we had the option of trying both at the table.

Service was impatient at first, as we were initially tentative and indecisive about our choices. I wished the server could have been much more educational with their strengths and limitations to help us make the right decisions on this very first visit. However, she later became much more warm, accessible, attentive, and helpful towards the middle and end of the meal. Price-wise, their items were pricy with the portions we received. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Beef Briskets and Chicken Dinner."}
{"text":"I've lived in Madison for almost 3 years and have stupidly spent most of that time heading to Brickhouse BBQ whenever the porky craving strikes. No longer! This place is the real deal.

I can't speak to the entire menu because I order the same thing every time I'm there: pulled pork sandwich, garlic mashed potatoes, biscuits. The mashed potatoes are stupid good, like, eyes-roll-in-the-back-of-your-head-with-the-first-bite good. They give you a little cup, which is good for me because I could eat a whole barrel of the stuff. BBQ sauce has a bit of a kick, but isn't unbearably spicy. 

On my last visit, I saw they added mac and cheese to the menu (uuhhhhhh yummmm) but I don't know if I can bear to part with one of my other sides to try it. I'll just have to make my boyfriend order double biscuits instead."}
{"text":"This is gonna be a difficult review to write and I don't want anyone to take it the wrong way.  Smoky Jons is good.  I mean, it's smoked, slow-cooked, sauce-covered, deliciously unctuous dead pig.  By nature, it's delicious and awesome and good for your soul.

But all barbecue is good.  Good barbecue is great.  Smoky Jons is...Good.

I'm in Madison a few times a week for work and we've driven by this place a hundred times and every time said \"We should stop in here\".  We finally did yesterday.

The interior is nice, an order counter, a few tables, and a log-cabin'esque interior.  An okay place to eat lunch.  The menu is pretty expansive, with a good selection of sandwiches, platters, combos, sausages, sides, desserts, etc.  Whatever you like, meat-wise, you can find it here.

After perusing the menu, I decided on the chopped pork shoulder dinner plate.  I should say my family is from Tennessee and I grew up on chopped pork.  I grew up eating at shady back-country Tennessee BBQ places with dirt floors and plank counters and a weathered old man in the back basting a pig.  Barbecue is in my blood.

Smoky Jons was not up to par.  The meat was delicious, but not smoky at all.  You literally could not taste the pit, or the smoke, or the fire.  The sauce was good too, but soooo sweet.  I guess I grew up on a vinegar sauce and I realize that sauce is an intensely regional thing, but this was not what I enjoyed.

The sides were excellent.  Coleslaw is great.  Beans are perfect.  Sugar biscuits are delish.

Honestly, this is the best BBQ I've had in Madison.  But I've had better at several places in Milwaukee.  And I've had better at countless places in the south.

I know Smokey Jon's is apparently world-renowned for their BBQ so you should probably try it yourself, and honestly I'll probably go back again.

My favorite though?  No.

A-OK?  Yes, certainly."}
{"text":"A pulled pork bbq sandwich is one of my very favorite foods ever. It just might take center stage of my death row meal. When I travel, I usually try and find the serious local BBQ place and get their pulled pork. I have to say, Smoky Jon's is my all time favorite. It is friggen delicious. Some sides are really good, some are so-so. I've never had any other main dish because I always have to get the pork sandwhich. 

Unfortunately, I am going to knock off one star because of my last visit. I ordered the pulled pork, coleslaw, and apple sauce. While I'm waiting for my food to be prepared I hear someone in the back yell, \"this apple sauce is frozen.\" No one came and asked me to pick a different side, so I just assumed that they found some that wasn't frozen. I get my food to go, head to a local park, sit down to eat. My applesauce is one solid ice cube. WTF. You have got to be kidding me."}
{"text":"Tucked away on the north side of Madison. I've driven past it thousands of times but went there yesterday on a recommendation from a friend of mine who knows his BBQ. Soooooo gooooooood. I had the pork shoulder sandwich. The baked beans were pure flavor country. I wish everything I ate from here on out could be drizzled in that BBQ sauce. Service was pretty quick and the prices were not bad either. I'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"Well, I read the reviews and thought this would be impressive. Nothing could be farther from the truth! The dude at the counter appeared annoyed that we interrupted him yesterday, the portions on the beans and potato salad were miniscule (I was unaware that you could even serve beans and potato salad in a cup designed for condiments, but lo and behold, here it was--- 3 bites later and both were history). We had the pulled pork sandwiches, and I make better at home. The bbq sauce was good, but that was about it. We don't plan on coming back ever, especially not for $23.00 for 2 people... But, we did fill up on gelato at the mall about 20 minutes later as we were still hungry when we left. I'm wondering where in the heck the other folks on here ate, because this wasn't at all the same experience they had."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Packed little bbq joint with awards all over the walls. About 8 tables. Come early or you won't get a table. Attentive waitstaff. I got the smoked sliced beef brisket dinner. Huge portions of meat. Left full for about 17$. That included 2 sides and a soft drink. I will be back. It's not the most amazing bbq I've ever had but it's definitely great and close by."}
{"text":"good old classic BBQ in madison, wi.  not the best BBQ i've ever had but it will do.  and the prices aren't too bad either"}
{"text":"Best barbecue in all of Madison, WI! The brisket is better than Texas. The sauce is legendary and the ribs make me cry from joy."}
{"text":"Maybe I'd like Smoky Jon's more if I liked ribs? I'm clearly in the minority, but after three visits I just haven't found anything to wow me. I will say the original sauce is great - I love a peppery BBQ sauce and I'd be happy to put it on most things. The barbecue itself, though, just isn't for me.

The first time I tried Smoky Jon's, I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich for takeout. I had fallen in love with smoked turkey while living in Texas and was super excited to find it on the menu. What I got was deli-thin meat drowning in sauce. I couldn't detect any smokiness in the meat itself, and I honestly wasn't convinced that it was smoked in house. 

Next time I tried the brisket, and was served similarly thinly-sliced meat. It was on the leaner side, which I preferred, but for my view a slice of brisket shouldn't be much thinner than a quarter of an inch. There should also be some gradation in the color of the meat; mine was pretty gray/brown. Maybe it was just an off day, but I haven't been motivated to try the brisket again. 

The best of the bunch was my most recent visit where I got the chopped pork sandwich. The flavor was decent and I could at least find some bits of delicious pink smokiness. The chop was very fine, though, and it looks like it's served up with an ice cream scoop. When I'm craving barbecue, I want a hunk of meat. I haven't been able to find that at Smoky Jon's, and if it's not their style, that's fine. I'm obviously in the minority. 

The final push into shrugs for the place came with the last visit. We got takeout, and my boyfriend's combo dinner was missing the ribs. He contacted the restaurant and was told to look for a gift certificate in the mail - they wouldn't issue a refund. We finally got one, but it was literally for just the ribs. Since we've been underwhelmed over the course of our visits it's not really enough to bring us back in. My BF was put off enough by the hassle of not being given half his dinner, having to call, and then wait for weeks to get the certificate in the mail to not want to spend any more money. 

I'm glad so many folks love them and that Smoky Jon likely brought (or at least amplified) BBQ to the Madison food scene, but I think I'll stick to other options in the future."}
{"text":"1/2 slab and pork shoulder with sugar fried biscuits and garlic mashed potatoes. We need one of these in Philadelphia. The BBQ was so tender and flavorful.  Sides were good but not as amazing as the meat. Will definitely be back to try the brisket before I head back east. The restaurant itself is small and cramped but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"There's a reason they win so many BBQ awards! This is the type of restaurant that my heart desires... a random, hole in the wall in a not-popular location with killer food and vibes. 

Literal hole in the wall location across from the airport and Ale Asylum. You'll miss it if you're not paying attention. Inside is an old log cabin type theme. You order at the counter and your food will be brought out to you. 

The sauce. It needs its own review. It's atypical of most sauces. It has a Chunky texture with onions, peppers and who cares what else because it is thaaat good. It leaves a little tingle from the heat but not too bad (I'm not a fan of spicy). Pair it with any of their meats and you are in B-B-Q heaven. 

My husband loves their burgers but how can I not order pulled pork or beef? The meat is tender, tasty and top notch. The fries are great and so are the beans, Mac and cheese, slaw; errything. Only thing I wish they'd step their game up on is the buns. They are bright yellow and almost look fake, I wonder what's up with that... 

Hubs is a Madison native but I'm a Southern Ohio girl. However, whenever we are back in Madison, this is the first place we stop for lunch. Bonus points for selling and shipping bottles of their awesome sauce online! Just wish they had high chairs."}
{"text":"Damn good barbeque. Possibly the best I've had in Madison if I'm looking for something rich that will definitely fill you up and leave you feeling guilty. The ribs are top notch and the sauce is just right. Meat falls right off the bone and the sides are adequate. Just wish they had a spicy variant of some of their items. The interior goes great with the food; lots of vintage Americana items and newspaper cutouts of stunning reviews of the food. The service is very friendly, always willing to help you make up your mind about menu choices. The wait isn't very long for an entrée and that's valuable. A friend I came with had the pulled pork burger and praised it greatly. 
The food really lives up to its record-setting reputation. I'll be back in moderation so as not to clog my pipes up."}
{"text":"The only reason why they get 2stars...is the SEASONING SALT. 
Good gosh... I don't know what all they are putting in that seasoning salt but my mom made sure I brought back some. 

On our first visit, April 2010, we went on Monday and it was CLOSED.
So we went back on Tuesday because my friend from Alabama (AL) swore it was great. Erghh.. naw. Famous Dave's is better. And we're Southerners that are still in shock that there's good BBQ up north or in a restaurant for that matter. Cuz (yep I wrote 'cuz) we believe in smoking our own in the barrel on the Patio in the backyard. :^) 

Anywhoo, you can tell that seasoning salt made an impression because I haven't mentioned the food. For 1: I believe in supporting local/little guys. So maybe you'll like something that I can't support and that's good if you find something to love. (2) Went to every grocery store in town to buy the seasoning salt and only found the less-than-stellar BBQ sauce on the shelf. Child, I had to drive back to the restaurant May 2011 and buy a case of seasoning salt to make sure the folks in Louisiana didn't need me to ship any in the future. 

And let me tell you, we know a lot about seasoning and flavor in Louisiana courtesy of Creole, Cajun and good ole Southern cooking (not to mention the French influence) but my point?? We are the home of Zatarian's & Tony Cachere's so good seasoning salt is a staple. So, Kudos to Smoky Jon's for getting it right! Oh it's best on plain ole' french fries or mashed potatoes. You get the full zest. Not necessarily on the meat.    ***** 5 stars for the salt & being locally owned & operated. No stars for anything else. Oh! google Tony Cachere's & Zatarian's if you know not of what I speak. lol."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars for the food only..We had out of town co last night and ordered ribs and beef brisket-(serving for 4-6)plus a sandwich platter. Drove 20 minutes home to find 2 of the 3 family portion sides missing ( also one of the sides for the platter).. This happened even asking the server to check what was in the order... I think when you spend over 60.00 on carry out and leave a tip... Your food should make it into the bag.. BUT we can't complain about the food- it was excellent!
Oh.. They did say they'd refund our credit card for what was missing but what they really missed was how inconvenient this was!

The owner actually contacted me and apologized. This takes the rating to 5 stars. Thank you Jon!"}
{"text":"After surviving my first tornado scare in Madison, Wisconsin, I ventured out to this well known local BBQ hangout for some good old smoky ribs and all the fixings.

With the Midwest reputation of having some of the finest meats, it was a no brainer to order the 1/3 slab BBQ smoked ribs and pork shoulder sandwich combination dinner ($14.75). The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.

The pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. 

My dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which I picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.

The cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport. The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant. So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!"}
{"text":"I'm not a die hard BBQ fan nor do I normally spring for it when I'm hungry but after eating here I may change my tune.
The ribs are amzaing, the meat practically falls off the bone and is so tender!! The pulled pork sandwich is equally delicious and the serving size is more than generous. The sweet bisquits are a nice way to end the meal, served piping hot and covered in powdered sugar; although ordering them serperate is recommended as the baked beans and fries are a must have!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends after work one night.  We 'd been looking for a good BBQ place in Madison, and Smoky Jon's was the first place we tried.  Needless to say, we won't be trying any place else!

The first thing that struck me was the great atmosphere in the restaurant.  It's a small place, maybe 15 tables total, and there's blues music playing in the background.  We put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables.  We grabbed a couple of tables and didn't have to wait very long before our food was brought out.

Oh was the food good.  I ordered a 1/3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter.  The pork was piled on it's bun in plentiful quantities.  It was pretty good, the pork had good flavor and my only complaint is that it wasn't quite as tender and juicy as some of the homemade stuff I've had.  The ribs, though, were amazing.  The meat was incredibly tender.  More importantly, though, was that there was a lot of meat on each bone.  I'm used to seeing skimpy ribs get served at restaurants where you're left wanting more after a full rack.  Here, in just 4 bones I found I was very full.  Smoky Jon's sauce was a great compliment to the meat as well.  Good full flavor with a nice little kick at the end.

The sides were equally excellent.  The baked beans are a must, and I saved mine for the end so that's the flavor I would leave with.  I also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty good too.

The highlight of the meal, though, was something one of my friends had ordered.  The restaurant also had chili available (which may just be a seasonal item).  It was served with a fork rather than a spoon, and with good reason.  I've never seen chili that was that thick and meaty.  I was able to get a taste of it and was floored by how great the flavors were.  It was so good that I almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day.

Smoky Jon's is a must for BBQ fans in Madison.  The prices are good, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is perfect.  We will be going back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I was visiting Madison for the Ironman tournament, and had to check out Smoky Jon's. I loved the the ribs! The ribs were flavorful, fall off the bone goodness. The sides were just ok, but that's ok because I came for the ribs. I wish I could be regular Smoky Jon's customer, instead of back in Los Angeles with a hungry memory."}
{"text":"I love this place! I had them cater my wedding, had the Pig up and Go package delivered and set up. We had BBQ pork, beef, and turkey along with sides. The only complaint I had was the turkey, I had assumed (and I know you should never assume!) it would be fresh, shredded turkey like the the pork and beef, but it was the processed, sliced turkey breast meat chopped up. That set aside, everything was delivered as scheduled, the employee who dropped the food off was very courteous and made sure to give us clear instructions on everything. We also visited here prior to our wedding and I shared the whole rack of ribs with my daughter and my husband had gotten the rotisserie chicken, the helpings were huge, the ribs were thick with meat and we did not leave hungry! Way better than Famous Dave's ribs"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I ordered a spicy chicken breast dinner plate. I didn't even know I was also getting a slab of ribs. The barbecue sauce I also added on the chicken sandwich. Omg delicious. It was to die for. Sooooooo good. I also had French fries and a salad. 

But one thing you may want to know is that no outside beverages are allowed. I have been going everywhere with a bottle of water so I can stay on top of drinking more water but it's not allowed at this place. Other than that, the food is great."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 stars is because the ribs without the sauce are really really good and so was the corn.  He advised us that the brisket would be really good but I found it dry and unappealing.  I like my brisket moist and fatty not lean and dry.  Also they say they close at 9 but the waitress started sweeping and cleaning around us while we were eating and saying they were closing in 15 mins. If your going to close at 830 say you close at 830 don't advertise that you close at 9"}
{"text":"Had I not woken this morning with BBQ on my mind, and had our go-to spot not been closed, it would have been a lot longer before I tried Smoky Jon's.  Both my wife and I pass the small establishment several times a week and continually vow to give it a shot.  This afternoon, with all of the stars seemingly aligned, I finally walked into the heavenly smelling business.  I ordered the Smoked Beef Brisket Jumbo Sandwich Platter (after reading many of the reviews here on Yelp) and my wife opted for the Smoked Chopped Pork Jumbo Sandwich Platter (solely for being a fan of BBQ pork).  I was offered a water while I waited and waited none-too-long for our order.  I must say that I was a little taken-aback by the small seating area for such a renowned and award-winning taste.

Back at home we were treated to perfectly seasoned fries and pretty good BBQ sauce.  What did not fair that well with us were the size of the sides and the dry meats.  By ordering the \"Jumbo Platter,\" I was expecting more than a small cup of baked beans and mac & cheese.  If it is simply a matter of cost to provide larger servings, I would suggest to remove \"Jumbo\" from the menu.  As for the dryness of both the pork and beef, it was not severe but enough to comment on.

Long story short, I will continue to frequent another establishment.  However, if I get a hankering for BBQ on Sunday ever again, I'll return and be happy."}
{"text":"I now know what you get when you pray to baby Jesus... these ribs. SO GOOD!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had to make sure I didn't leave any sauce on my fingers prior to typing this. Wait, did I? Nope, clean. Most likely because I licked them clean from the baller sauce that is on this BBQ. The sauce has a great consistency to it and it clings nicely to the meat. 

I went with the sig-other and between the two of us, we had the pork shoulder sandwich,  brisket, and ribs. I think we both went with fries and the Cole-slaw for our sides. They were fine. Sides are sides. I realllllllly wish there would have been corn bread. Something doesn't right within me if there is no corn bread to accompany BBQ. I was sad when I found out there was no cornbread.

But then I was happy again the moment I was able to put that delicious pig in my mouth. The ribs were ribs. The brisket and the pork shoulder was where it was at for me, but really, I think you can slap that sauce on cardboard and it would be delicious.

I'm a west-sider so coming out here is a haul. A worth while haul. Be prepared to wait though; the dining room is small.  They did get out food out to us really quickly, but if we would have come 15 minutes later we would have had to wait in a long line to place our order, and then would have had no where to sit. 

Oh, and if I wasn't such a bottomless pit, there would have been plenty of leftovers as the portions are plentiful. I definitely did not leave hungry."}
{"text":"I keep thinking my experience at Smoky Jon's will be better than it ever is. I lived and worked nearby for a number of years, and ate there often. 

The staff were always incredibly friendly, and even got to know my order after awhile. Their sugar fried biscuits were a must until I had to go gluten-free, and I always enjoyed the corn and mashed potatoes with my pork shoulder.

Overshadowing this, though, were the counterproductive idiosyncracies of the business.  I enjoy quirky (and don't see it often enough these days,) but in this case, in the business sense, it confused me.

The owner is a bit...eccentric, to say the least.

Also, he's famous for his BBQ sauces. There are awards and ribbons all over the restaurant saying so. Fantastic! Why can't I get them on my dinner? 

There's only ONE sauce available in the restaurant (and it's on the sweeter end of the spectrum.) What about adding a mustard-based sauce? Or something in a spicier Texas-style?

Your sauce skills may be excellent, but if you don't allow your restaurant patrons to experience them, you're leaving them with a really narrow excerpt of what you have to offer. TELLING us how wonderful your work is PALES in comparison letting us TASTE it.

Even if there were only 2-3 options, that would put a whole 'nother spin on the SJ dining experience!

Additionally, the sides are tasty, but TEENY! I know the focus is on the protein, but even simply increasing the portion size by 50% (and keep the 2 sides/entree) would be a good start. Or double+ their size and have 1 side/entree. (The entrees w/sides aren't exactly cheap.)

In closing, next time you stop by, on your way in, take a look at the happy, oblivious-looking pig painted on the building, sitting on the globe, munching on a rack of tasty pork ribs. 

Is he just there for the award-winning sauce, or do you think he knows he's unintentionally advocating porcine cannibalism?"}
{"text":"Best barbecue I've tried in Madison. And Jon came out to ask us how our food was! Very friendly staff, great service, amazing food!"}
{"text":"The ribs are the best BBQ in Madison by far and have never disappointed in many visits. The rest of the menu is inconsequential -- trust me, just get the ribs."}
{"text":"Try everything!  It is all exactly what you would expect from a BBQ place. I had the hot link. Tough to cut, but very delicious. I also had a great rack of ribs. Different flavor than I'm use to, but still great."}
{"text":"Staff is super helpful when my party couldn't decide what we wanted.  Service was fast and packaged quite well (take out).  

Barbecue pork shoulder was good, ribs were great, buns were good.  Something wasn't quite right with the sides though, we had coleslaw, potato salad, fries and beans (though I didn't try the beans) and while they were good, they were underseasoned and just missing something.  

Overall a very satisfying experience and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"It's been some time since I have been to Jon's - mostly because dinning in not much of an experience, but this BBQ is still the best in Madison!  You are usually going to find Jon on site - true sign of a place dedicated to quality.   So stop by and grab a rack - fill yourself with BBQ goodness!!!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue, awesome sauce, delicious corn & coleslaw! Friendly atmosphere and wonderful service. I enjoyed every bit."}
{"text":"Wow - really good BBQ. A great option when picking up or dropping off at the airport. We tried the ribs, brisket and pork, all of which were great. All sides were tasty too. The sauce was a nice blend of sweet and spicy. Definitely will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"First things first: the house BBQ sauce is fabulous. I love that it isn't just the regular brown house made goop that most BBQ joints serve. You can actually see and taste all the different spices/herbs!! Like I said, fabulous. 

I went with the smoked chopped pork shoulder sandwich platter and two sides: the potato salad and the corn. If you (like me) choose to order the corn to ease your conscience (after all, it is a vegetable, right?)...do not be fooled. The corn is puuuure buttery goodness. The potato salad is also delicious! Truly, the perfect complement to the sandwich. Creamy, no skin, no dill, just the way I like my potato salads. :9

At $8.45, the sandwich platters are very reasonably priced for the quantity of food you get. The takeout service is super quick as well - I think I got my food within 2-3 minutes of placing my order. Otherwise, Smoky Jon's seems like a fun place to dine in as well (lots of exposed wooden paneling and checkered tablecloths). You'll probably want to limit your party to a group of 4 or less though, the seating is limited!

Yelp recommendations for what to order as a first-timer to Smoky Jon's are on point. I can't wait to be back to try the ribs!!

Tip: their parking lot is tiny and shared with the bar next door, so don't expect to find any open spaces around lunch or dinner time. You'll have better luck parking on one of the residential streets behind the joint."}
{"text":"So damn good I ate the whole plate of food and a second portion. I couldn't breathe for two days I was so full."}
{"text":"This spot is good, really good! I want to give them 5 stars & they are so close; a second visit will seal the deal. 

When it comes to real bbq in Madison choices are few...this spot more than helps fill a gap - it's the real deal.

We ordered a full rack of ribs & a sliced brisket dinner - sure the price seems high at first but then you taste that tender meat with a solid char & you get it. This is it. Everything about the meat is perfect here - true story. The sauce that the meat comes coated in is vinegary with black pepper as a big component. It's good & by no means spicy, unless you think black pepper is spicy. (We all have that friend!)

For sides we got baked beans, mac & cheese, coleslaw, & fries. The \"warm\" sides were served on the cold side, the rolls are very dry, however, the Mac is by far the cheesiest,  most buttery mac I have ever had! Dense & intense! The fries could have been more seasoned/crispy, but the coleslaw was spot on and the baked beans seemed okay...but a little on the cold side, at least for eat-in...but that might be a personal issue, hot food I like to be served in the 'almost too hot to eat' category. 

The dining room is small - take out at high-times must be the way to go. Service is quick, friendly, & casual fast-food style. Definitely the best bbq in Madison I have experienced."}
{"text":"It gets 4 stars for being great BBQ AND being this far in Yankee country.  I'd probably rate it at 3.5 stars if I could so that my scores relative to this one would make more sense overall.  But I digress....

I ordered the ribs and a brisket sandwich with the spicy corn and the baked beans for dinner about two weeks ago.

The verdicts:

Ribs = VERY well done.  Tender, pull-off-the-bone and delicious.  The sauce is where you get the refinement too (beyond the smoking process of course, which is an art in itself).  There are a lot of flavors going on in the sauce and it's not overdone in terms of application.  I've eaten BBQ everywhere and this place's ribs stand up with anyone's.

Brisket Sandwich = Boring.  I was told what I was ordering, so kudos to the service because they were dead on.  It was less of a sandwich and more of brisket on a plain roll.  That's fine of course, but for some reason I feel like sandwich doesn't describe this well.  It does remind me of the bare minimum approach you find in many BBQ joints around, but I don't like it there either.  Anyway, the brisket was very tasty and you should just order it on its own.  No point in getting a piece of bread that just hides the taste of good BBQ.

Spicy Corn = Awesome.  Truly delicious stuff, and I plowed through it in 30 seconds.  Perfect amount of spice too.  Wish I had a little more in that serving, but it will bring me back...soooo mission accomplished?

Baked Beans = Awesome.  I asked if they were made in house, I was told that they were and my palate was rewarded with some of the finest baked beans one can find.  Thick, almost pasty (in a good way) and chock full of flavor.

The only downfalls would be that it's somewhat pricey for what you get, but food is going up everywhere.  I also ordered a sandwich combo, which was a mistake.  

The service was top notch.  Everything and more was explained to me in detail.  I only have myself to blame for trying that damn sandwich combo.  Please take it off of the menu...your customers are getting punished for ordering it and it takes away from what you do best.

The decor is nice and very 'southern' in the sense that this is without a doubt a BBQ place.  I liked looking over all of the trophies and reading the articles and seeing the old pictures.  Very cool stuff.

I got mine to go as well, which was quickly brought out to me.  Eating in looks like it would be fun."}
{"text":"I was in Madison for a quick business meeting and love trying new BBQ joints. I visited Smoky Jon's last Thursday for some Q before returning to the airport. I received a warm welcome from the nice lady behind the counter. She asked where I was from when she heard my Southern accent and I gave her one of the BBQ Judge business cards.

I pondered the extensive menu and chose a sampler plate to try both ribs and brisket. I was disappointed to learn that they were out of sliced brisket, but they had chopped brisket. I ordered, sat down, and the food arrived very fast.

The 4 bone ribs were covered in a chunky heavy BBQ sauce. I normally like my ribs dry, and don't care for chunky sauces, but this sauce was surprisingly good. The ribs had a beautiful smoke ring and smokey taste. The only complaint about the ribs is they don't remove the membrane from the back of the ribs. The membrane leaves a thin plastic like skin that must be removed before eating.  

On a few occasions I have had chopped brisket, usually when a cook messes up the brisket and it is too tough to serve sliced. However, I don't think that was the situation at Smoky Jon's.  A large helping of chopped brisket was placed on a large bun without sauce. The surprise to me was how finely chopped the brisket was; my experience with chopped brisket is  it is chopped into chunks, not finely shredded like at Smoky Jon's. Regardless, the taste was good and it was a large portion.

The baked beans were good, but I didn't care for the mac & cheese side dish. The mac & cheese was too cheesy for my taste, but I recognize I was in Cheese Land so I am not surprised that they used extra cheese.

The interior of the restaurant is lined with log cabin style wood and a huge trophy case displays there numerous BBQ contest trophies. Additionally, some of the walls have magazine covers showing their selection as BBQ restaurant of the year for many years in a row.

Overall, Smoky Jon's has good BBQ, especially for being north of the Mason-Dixon Line. I would have given 5 stars if the rib membrane had been removed and the mac & cheese wasn't so cheesy. Good Q and good people at Smoky Jon's!!!!"}
{"text":"When I only ordered sandwiches I was doing it all wrong. The way to go is to get a half chicken and the 1/3 slab combo with brisket. Insane amount of food? Yes. Worth getting to try all the best parts of the menu? Yes!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Excellent customer service. Place is really busy at lunch time so prepare to stand in line."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ. When you pull into parking lot there are few spaces available. Once you get inside the restaurant you smell the food you are about to eat. Everything we had was awesome - chopped brisket, chopped pork, baked beans and corn. When in Madison definitely stop by and fill up with some awesome BBQ."}
{"text":"I was really craving a hot link sandwich and a quick search brought me to Jon's. I ended up with the Ribs and hot link combo with Mac and cheese and potato salad. Overall it was fine. My favorite part was the bread. 

Ribs were good. Smoky and tender. 

Sauce is ok, I like mine a little sweeter and spicier. 

Hot link was almost great, but too dry to be snappy. 

Mac and cheese - yikes. It's like someone prepped a good Mac and cheese but instead of baking it thy just put it in the microwave. It's not kraft or velveeta style, but just thick sludge like melty cheese and elbow noodles. The texture is all wrong. 

Potato salad - eh. I took it home and added some mustard. Doesn't taste home made - taste like the weird grocery store potato salad where the chunks of potato are too big and kind of rubbery. The only good thing I can say is it doesn't have raisins in it. 

Sandwich bread and dinner roll - soft and a little sweet. I ate the potato salad and Mac with this and it made it much more palatable. 

The ribs are pretty good so 3 stars over all."}
{"text":"i'm back! damn good bbq!! I'm glad I was able to get my boyfriend to come with this time around. I'm always talking about this place everywhere I go."}
{"text":"I've had BBQ across this great land of ours from Austin to Dallas to NYC to LA to St Louis to New Orleans and places in between and I'm gonna share a secret with you - Smoky Jon's is the best BBQ I've ever had.  The ribs and pulled pork are the most tender, perfectly smoky and best tasting i've had.  I'm not an evangelist for dry rub or wet rub or combo - all I want is good tasting grub.  The sauce here is delicious.  The sides here are also some of the best.  The baked beans have little pieces of pork in em and are super tasty.  

If you're going to the airport its right by the entrance - make a quick stop and you won't be disappointed.

FYI - Jon of Smokey Jon's has won BBQ competitions all over the US.  His BBQ grill is a huge pink pig that he hauls on the back of his truck to competitions.  Jon also is a huge big nice looking man.  He knows his BBQ probably from first hand experience."}
{"text":"Alright, let me be quite frank. The building that this restaurant is located in is not appealing to the eye at all. I thought it was an abandoned building for quite some time until I heard that I should try it. 

Once stopping in, the space is quite small and only offers about six or seven tables for customers, which is a tight squeeze. This is a order at the counter type of restaurant, and then the server will bring it to your table. The food is displayed on a wooden board and there are a ton of choices.

We ordered ribs (after hearing all about their award-winning sauce) and some side dishes. There was nothing super impressive to me about their food. It was fine. Just not great. I might try again soon, but the food was more expensive than I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town!

We had the ribs and the brisket. Both were amazing! The house BBQ sauce was fantastic. We had leftovers for lunch the next day even after eating until we were sick. The portions are huuuge. 

Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu! Worth a visit if you're in the area, or just drive on over if you're not..."}
{"text":"Technically I would give over 4 stars, but not quite 5. We got ribs which were well flavored and delicious. Sides included mashed potatoes, fries, and Mac n cheese. The mashed potatoes and fries were great. The mac n cheese had just a little too much cheese, which turned into a gooey consistency. Additionally, the staff were friendly,  but failed to complete our take out order correctly. We ordered 1 1/2 racks of ribs, when we got home we discovered we were only given 1 rack, yet charged for 1 1/2 racks. If it was just a few bucks it wouldn't have mattered, but this food isn't cheap! Without hassle the staff recognized their mistake, but I still had to go back to the restaurant to retrieve the rest of our meal. The staff were very apologetic for the error, offering dessert, which I can appreciate. We will be returning, but will be double checking our order next time before we head home."}
{"text":"Sweeet....No really, the sauce is really sweet.  If you like your BBQ sweet, this is your place.  I didn't care for it on a pulled sandwich, but think it might taste better on ribs.  My beef (haha) is with the sides.  I asked if the salads were homemade, and the woman taking my order said, \"We have the ingredients here to make them.\"  If you have the ingredients, that means the salads are homemade.  However, the coleslaw and potato salad are from a container, they are not homemade, and I have a feeling the BBQ beans are canned beans with sauce mixed into them.  It's good to know, and I would have changed my side dish order if I had known."}
{"text":"A few of us hit Smoky Jon's for lunch today.  It was insisted that it's the best BBQ in Madison, so I was game to try it.

The place has character - you order at a window and go take a seat.  They bring the food out to you.  Nothing fancy - paper plates, styrofoam cups, etc.

I got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries.  I snarfed a fry to start.  Not very hot... \"warm\", I'd say. But tasty - salty.  Could have been better if fresh, but they'll do.  The coleslaw was the creamiest I've ever had.  The flavor wasn't strong, but it was okay.  Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found.  The pork was tasty - definitely smokey.  The side of sauce made it, however.  Sweet, tangy, spicy.  While I was eating it, I thought \"yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it\".  Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, \"you know, that was REALLY good!\"

While it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth. I'd have it again.  I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water).  I was full, and content.  Mission accomplished!

My coworker had some ribs, and they looked very good - not too fatty, cooked well.  I would like to go back and try them sometime!

Tip:  Limited seating, so show up early (or late!)"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Madison. Hands down. Pork sandwich with 2 sides: beans and corn!! $9 total The corn was so garlicky good, with a little heat. The staff was so awesome, friendly and happy to help with selection. Will def return soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ, especially for a place in WI. This place is known for its ribs, and it deserves the praise it gets for them. There are some other hits, and some less than stellar items on the menu. 

We got the half slab and jumbo 1/2 chicken dinner to share, which was huge! Big portions, but the chicken was really dry. The ribs were amazing. We also ordered some beef brisket, which is a much smaller portion than the ribs and chicken. If you're not a fan of fatty brisket (like me) than you'll be quite happy with their brisket. No awkward moments of biting into a string of fat and trying to spit it out in front of your date. 

The sides, overall, could be better. But lets be honest, you're not here for the sides. If you don't want to order any sides you'll save about a buck, but it's worth it to venture out and try them. The baked beans were iffy. I heard a lot of good things about them via Yelp, but ours were grey-ish and tasted off. The potato salad is definitely full fat and more mayo based. It's a nice and cool way to offset the kick of BBQ. The french fries are more run-of-the-mill than anything else here. We also tried the fried biscuits after seeing so many people rave about them. Maybe I had too high of expectations? They were good, they tasted a bit like carnival food, but they didn't garner a \"Oh my, I'd eat these every day if I could\" opinion like the ribs did.

The sauce here is unlike any other BBQ sauce I've ever had. It's a bit chunky and sweeter than usual but has a nice kick at the end. 

Definitely go for the ribs. The brisket is good. Chicken could be better. The sides are hit or miss. We got take-out since the seating is limited. It's also pretty loud there, lots of people talking and loud music. I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place was my favorite BBQ in the past. However, now all menu items are smaller, the prices are higher and the sauce is lower quality. I believe smokey Jon can make an award winning sauce but he's not bringing it here. The sides are always top notch the meat is alright but made to be drenched in BBQ, kind of plain alone. All around too expensive for the portion size and used to be a lot higher quality. Also the owner is a self loathing \"champ\" of BBQ. Don't go here if you don't want to be threatened by him."}
{"text":"Just updating from 4 to 5 stars. This place continues to amaze with awesome barbeque!"}
{"text":"Wound up here after That BBQ Joint inexplicably took graduation week off.  I was seriously disappointed seeing the little hand written note in the window.  I'm getting off track. ..  You're reading this to get my thoughts on Smoky Jon's BBQ.  I'll start with the positives.  The restaurant was particularly clean and the staff was attentive and friendly.  The ribs were tender and portions were plentiful.  Oh, and the steak fries were nice.

I feel guilty whenever I give a 2 star review for a place with friendly staff, but I can't justify 3 stars considering the food.  It only warrants the 2 star, \"Meh. I've experienced better\".  As for the award winning bbq sauce, I wasn't a fan.  It's tomato based, which is my preference, but is overpowered by a ton of black peppercorns.  Again, the ribs were tender, but lacked the smoky, well-seasoned flavor I was hoping for. The chicken was dry and the primary flavor was garlic powder.  The mac n' cheese was similar to Kraft also with a heavy dose of garlic powder.  I'll probably pass on this place the next time I'm in town, but if you have an abnormal affection for black pepper & garlic powder give em a go and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night and ordered brisket sandwich and my companion ordered the pork sandwich.  It's a pretty simple menu--you can get either a combo dinner or a sandwich plate, and both of em come with two sides.  I got the side salad & sugar fried donuts, he got the french fries and pasta salad.  Side salad=basically straight from a \"American\" salad bag with a packet of dressing on the side.  Sugar fried biscuits reminded me of beignets.

Anyways, onto the important stuff--the BBQ! I usually get pulled pork when at a BBQ place and was not disappointed. Rich and tender, good flavor, without an overly greasy mouthfeel like some places. was very happy with my meal. I am no BBQ expert, but the meat was tender and the BBQ sauce had a nice vinegar tang with some heat (not very hot, though). 


Atmosphere is very casual, paper plates, paper towel on the table, etc but service was very good.  The employee got our food out to us right away, cleared plates promptly, and even went out of his way to check the football score.

My only request to Smoky John is to turn up the heat in winter...the place is always a little cold with the door constantly opening and closing because of customers coming in.

My #1 BBQ place in Madison...plus while you are (briefly) waiting you can look at all the crazy little pig statues and BBQ awards for Smoky Jon's."}
{"text":"My awesome partner Chuck brought me takeout the other night. Delicious. We had some ribs and pulled pork sandwiches. Love the BBQ sauce. Potato salad was awesome also! Wish we had some good BBQ in Illinois!"}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue. Well priced, so filling. The beef link is exceptional, and everything else is good. Highly recommend - get yourself here."}
{"text":"I did not understand the hullabaloo. BBQ sauce was good. Side servings tiny. Since out of town, asked what was good and was told the pulled pork sandwich was popular for lunch. On reflection, should've gotten BBQ ribs as that was what all the awards on the walls were for. Oops."}
{"text":"Solid stack of half BBQ ribs with decent sides to pick from when getting a dinner combo is a bit on the pricey end since the sides seem to have gotten smaller (in a tiny container). The fries that came with the ribs were also soggy, so not sure if it's cause we waited too long to pick up the order. The tiny container of beans were delicious, just wished there was a bit more. 

I can see why the ribs may be considered award-winning, as half of the menu is just a list of awards they've won in the past. The beef brisket was also tender and delicious, but I personally like the ribs over the brisket. The corn and mac n' cheese are also good sides as well, just again wish it was bigger portion than was was given.

Each take-out dinner box had a fork and knife (even though on the menu it claims that utensils cost $0.50 extra, so just keep that in mind). Parking can also be tough as there are only a few spots located outside the restaurant and just keep an eye out for coming in and out of the small parking lot."}
{"text":"Overall the experience was average. Too much hype for something so adequate. But it makes for an okay place to pick up takeout food. I would go back only if I happen to be in that neighborhood. And if I couldn't find anything else. 

Service: not very good. Slightly on the rude side. Didn't smile once the whole time we were there. But was still attentive and politely checked on us throughout the meal. Looking/sounding happy would probably have made a world of difference! Food came out quite fast!

Food: my boyfriend and I both got the 1/2 slab of ribs with fries and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese felt slimy and not very flavorful. The ribs were OK. The sauce was very smoky and there was lots of meat! But if this is suppose to be a multi award winning food, shouldn't it fall off the bone or maybe have something that makes it better than your average rack of ribs? The fries were the best part of the meal! Crispy and plentiful! 

Decor: love the little building! Definitely something very laid back although I was a little disappointed that all the food was on paper plates, plastic forks, and Styrofoam cups."}
{"text":"Great ribs....meaty, tender, great smoke taste and a little heavy on the sauce.  Next time I'll get them dry with sauce on the side.  The sauce is delicious bet like a lot of people I prefer to start dry and add sauce.  The French fries were hot and crispy and the baked beans okay but the ribs are the real deal."}
{"text":"Ribs were good, but sauce was a little too sweet.  Review was so close to 4 stars but the corn was cooked in margarine. Really?  Margarine?  C'mon you're in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"After hearing that this place was the bees knees from many friends and reviews, I decided to take a small group of friends and give it the test.  Afterwards I was impressed and absolutely full, but I wouldn't give it the BBQ crown.

I think most of the value here comes from its uniqueness.  Smoky Jon's sits in a small little log-cabin-style shack, and when you walk in you are witness to the plethora of awards they have received from their delicious BBQ fixins.  Soon, you'll discover their own personal sauce (which I hope you slather across your food), and a menu that has item descriptions which make you want to grow a second stomach.  Corn bread, beans, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, etc; all the delectable food you'd expect from a place like this.  I personally had ribs and brisket with corn bread, and I ate every last bite with no regrets.

Problem is, I've had some really good Barbecue in my life, and the overall taste of the food, while good, wasn't great in comparison.  Some of the places I've dined at in Kansas City, for instance, were a step up from this.  Even some of the dishes at Famous Daves could rival Smoky Jon's, although the ribs certainly could not.  

The rest of my party all had mixed responses.  My girlfriend didn't really care for what she ordered (I can't remember what it was, a sandwich of some sort), and several of them didn't like the smallishness of the place or the service.  The lady was OK, but she was behind the counter mostly and didn't do much to make us feel welcome.  When we walked in we were all really excited to be there and try it, and she was just kind of \"meh.\"  Also, the location is probably the least desirable of any restaurant I've been to in Madison, but that's more relative to where you live or how you feel about certain neighborhoods.

Overall, worth a try and probably one of the better BBQs as far as Madison goes.  While it doesn't get the full star ride from me, I can see why others give it high praise."}
{"text":"Restaurant Review
Off the beaten path in Madison. I had looked up this place before on tripadvisor and was not disappointed. The restaurant itself is super small and the parking in front is rather limited (I had to drive around the block twice and realized that there was no parking in the back). Built as best BBQ in madison I was not disappointed. Fall of the bone tender ribs along with two sides was the meal I had. Get the sugar fried biscuits and you won't be disappointed. This place could be on diner and drives and I am glad I found it one my own! Also prices are super reasonable. No wonder why they won so many awards for there food. Best bbq sauce period.

Pro- Inexpensive, delicious bbq, hidden gem

Con- Small seating area, small parking, closes at 8:30 PM

Hidden deal- Order the combo to get the best bang for your buck"}
{"text":"Really good ribs! The ribs were tender and moist and flavorful, we appreciated that they weren't drenched in sauce. We added sauce as needed. The chicken was also good, but not exceptional.  We had baked beans, mashed potatoes, and sugar biscuits on the side. The sides were perfectly fine; everyone enjoyed them (the kids didn't love the beans, but ate them). The sugar biscuits were basically Chinese donuts (deep fried dough balls rolled in granulated sugar)--not biscuits, but a nice little sweet treat. (Warning-they're terrible cold)."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place today for lunch because my sister has told me that it really is the best BBQ place in Wisconsin... and after trying it today, I would have to agree!!

I don't think Pittsburgh has good BBQ to begin with, but this place definitely puts it to shame. I got one of the big B-B-Q dinner combinations: 1/3 slab of ribs and a beef brisket sandwich. Comes with two sides: I got the Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The BBQ was absolutely delicious and their sauce is out of this world (you will want extra). The meat was cooked so well, not dry at all, and super super flavorful. The mashed potatoes are TO DIE FOR! They are a must get. The Mac and cheese was really good too but the potatoes are on a whole different level.

Next time I'm in Madison, I will definitely be coming here and I highly recommend this place to everyone... prices are pretty typical of a bbq place (pricey), but in my opinion this is the only place that's worth it haha."}
{"text":"Anyone who hasn't given a 5 star needs to just stop eating BBQ. lol You are doing it wrong."}
{"text":"Best bbq in the area.....bar none! ! Excellent food and ya can't help but enjoy the wit of the help.
.looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This was the second time I've eaten here.  The first time was a few years ago and I had the brisket and ribs.  The ribs were really good and the brisket was decent.  It was the flat and was cut thin, probably because it was a touch dry.  It had a good flavor though.

The second time was this month (July 2014) and I got the brisket platter with two sides.  The baked beans were decent.  Nothing special, but tasted fine.  The Mac-n-cheese was pretty good.  There was a lot of cheese sauce in relation to macaroni.  I like a little crunch to my mac and cheese, but this was thick and creamy, which is OK.  The brisket was great.  It wasn't cut paper thin, had a nice smoke ring and was easily pulled apart with fingers.  In other words it was tender and not dry at all.  Much better than the first time I visited.  My only complaint would be they put sauce on the brisket.  I prefer sauce on the side because good barbeque doesn't need sauce and this brisket didn't need sauce."}
{"text":"We ordered a 1/2  rib and brisket .
I like baby back rib myself , this place has St. Louis style/ Spares rib .
The St. Louis Spares was good in this place ,a little dry ,not greasy .
I had St. Louis Spares in other place before ,they were too greasy ,this place is not .
I like BBQ sauce on the side ,they put sauce on rib and brisket ,the sauce had very too much pepper ,my wife can not eat food with that much pepper ,she gave me the brisket .
I wish they offer sauce on the side .
We do not live in Madison ,drive pass the area often ,I will try it one more time ."}
{"text":"This place is great and very authentic. The sauce is so yummy...no wonder they sell bottles of it! I just wish the sides were a bit bigger. I was also expecting cornbread, but they didn't have any. I would have preferred that over the dinner roll. They also don't have beer/wine which would have been nice. Despite these things, I will definitely be coming back!"}
