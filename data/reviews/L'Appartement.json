{"text":"\"Plein de Douchebags et de Chicks stupide.\" Vraiment, ca représente bien ce restaurant. Le décor est beau, le staff est beau, mais il n'y a aucun contenu, c'est vide à l'intérieur.

La bouffe sortait droit micro-onde, le parmessan devait avoir passé deux jours sur le comptoir, vraiment, c'était ridicule. Le service était d'une lenteur prodigieuse. J'ai vraiment aimé le vin... mais ca ca n'a rien à voir avec le resto.

Je ne sais pas si ils essaient de nous impressionner avec le décor épuré et les prix surélevés mais la bouffe n'est vraiment pas à la hauteur."}
{"text":"We had a networking event last night with canapées the bartender Eve was amazing super friendly with all my guest. We had a very nice evening connecting with other female entrepreneurs at the WoW monthly events the canapées were amazing the slider. where great. the other two were so good none left for me but at least my guests enjoyed them !! highly recommend for your networking the lounge downstairs great for our monthly events See you next month!!!"}
{"text":"The place is nicely decorated and has a nice location along McGill street in the old port. A good size resto lounge equipped with a terasse on the a street and a solid dj on saturday night playing some nice beats. Not a place to come just for a drink, more for dinner and a cocktail, bar is kind of small. The waitress was very friendly and  helped my friend out with her wine selection, although wine and cocktails were average as well as the food. Opinions on the food around the table were that the braised beef was extremely tender and good portion, poutine was good but very heavy, salmon ribs and tartare were all average.

On a final note, the food is a bit to pricey, drinks ok, nice decor/presentation and great service.

It's worth a try to get your own experience but I don't think I'll give this one another go."}
{"text":"J'ai passé devant avec ma copine et un couple d'amis. Ma copine avait envie depuis un bon moment et mon amie solidaire l'a accompagnée au toilette, pendant que je regardais les critiques du resto sur Yelp.

Ma copine s'est rendu au toilette sans rencontrer personne, mais mon amie a rencontré un homme qui se disait le propriétaire. Il lui a demandé si elle allait vomir! Totalement surprise et scandalisée elle lui a répondu NON! Il lui a alors demandé si elle allait faire un numéro 1 ou 2! Elle a juste répondu d'un hochement inquiétée de la tête et s'est dépêchée d'entrer dans les toilettes sombre de l'établissement."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service by the blond waitress. I had been a couple of months ago with some friends and I wanted to bring myhusband to try their pulled pork poutine. I had checked the menu the night before and the poutine was still on it. When we checked the menu in the restaurant we were informed that it changes seasonally but that they had not updated their site. Very unprofessional and the waitress was rude about it. We got up and left without ordering anything to eat. We are now seated in grange vin & bouffe with excellent service."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés un mercredi soir. Coté ambiance, beau décor, mais un peu synthétique / froid.

Le gros problème est la nourriture. Le chef semble essayer de cuisiner pour des covers de magazines. La présentation est bien, mais nos mets étaient mal exécuté.
Steak calciné sur le dessus, accompagnement passé au micro ondes.

Ils offrent un menu gratuit pour les femmes le mercredi. Ils devraient laisser tomber ce menu, car il est honteux: pates surgelés avec une sauce tomate décevante. C'est gratuit, heureusement, mais pas une très bonne publicité.

Le service était bien, mais très lent.

Bref, de la bouffe qui n'impressionne que par son arrogance et son prix trop élevé."}
{"text":"While my brunch (granola ) was okay,  they undercooked 3 of my friends eggs (the egg white was transparent and still liquid ). They asked their eggs be cooked and their second dish was just the same as before. They also forgot our orders and gave us the wrong things many times. This place is overpriced with  a extremely poor quality kitchen. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant as I had just arrived in Montreal about an hour earlier and was starving. I'm glad I didn't read the reviews ahead of time because I would have missed out on a wonderful meal. I sat outside so I can't speak to the indoor ambiance, but the outdoor seating was very nice. The outdoor section is not on a busy street, so there weren't a ton of cars driving by and not a lot of car noise. I ordered the sangria, which was great, and the burger of the week. The burger had carrots on it, which I was doubtful of, but it was really delicious. The burger came with a fresh salad and great fries. I would say their dinner options are slightly pricey, but what I had was wonderful, so I didn't mind paying."}
{"text":"delicious food, great service, wonderful ambience! 

the rib eye steak is phenomenal and the osso bucco was melt in your mouth fantastic. not cheap but the portions were huge. 

recommended!"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner, not the lounge. Has a fun atmosphere and the service is very friendly, but the food was pretty ordinary. It was a special deal menu, so perhaps other options are better, but based on that my first impression is poor. (So tips to chefs... don't put your worst showings out for the deal nights. There is just too much good competition in the neighborhood.) 

Won't come back for the restaurant, but may be back for the lounge which sounds great. Unfortunately in the restaurant section they have the music pumped up like in a club, so makes conversation very difficult. But it was pretty good music! So maybe try out the lounge for a better experience."}
{"text":"The menu looked intriguing but the atmosphere was so abrasive that we had to leave before we even ordered. 

If you like uber-trendy fashionistas pushing their food around without eating and music so loud that you cannot hear the person you are dining with then by all means have at it."}
{"text":"Trust the ratings for this place. Poor service because the staff do not communicate. We only came here for brunch because Le Cartet's line was too long, big mistake. 

2 of the 6 meals came late, and weren't what we ordered. The plates were sent back 3 times. Each time both plates were just as wrong as the first error. 

Not to mention, they didn't try to salvage the situation. Save your time, hunger and money for the many other delicious restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"One good point : Staff was trying very hard to make us happy, despite the fact we didn't like our meal a bit (except for the wine, they have a nice choice). Ambiance... full of loud girls & pumped boys. Service was wayyy too long for a wednesday. The ' free ' menu for women on wednesday is absolutely NOT worth 20$, I had cannelloni, it tasted just like the ones you buy frozen at the grocery store, with a can of tomatoes on top, and the grated ' fresh' parmesan cheese was hard as rock, as if it stayed on the counter for hours. Appetizer was cheap, just a tiny green salad with vinaigrette. 

Really, overall. Do not go there. It's not good, and it's definately not worth the price. Besides, too much good restaurants around to waste your time and $ there."}
{"text":"This place has a fun, dim, atmosphere. It can get loud, especially downstairs at the club/lounge. For dinner, I had the risotto - mouth watering! And shared an appetizer with my friend - mini lobster pogo's. For the carnivores, I hear the steak is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Ahhhh L'Appartement! J'y deviendrais locataire demain matin...J'y suis retourner pour une 3ième fois et l'expérience y fut une encore très agréable. L'ambiance est décontracté sans être trop bruyante, les fenêtres y laissait entrer une lumière chaleureuse et le service, encore une fois impéccable et sympathique. Le menus est simple mais très bien exécuté et les prix fort attrayants. Définitivement une adresse a ajouter à son carnet! On signe où?"}
{"text":"Good was good-had the duck poutine which was good but very salty. The service was lovely; very kind. The music is very loud- expect a lounge feel. It is pretty pricy for the food but overall a good experience"}
{"text":"Downloaded yelp just to leave a review for this place.  Once is more than enough. Overpriced, loud, cramped, portions almost seem like a just for laughs gags joke.  Unfortunately no camera crew. Felt cheated. Better off going to a high end steakhouse, spend a bit more but get a good meal out of it."}
{"text":"Just went for drinks but my sangria was delicious. I would definitely check this place out again next time I'm in Montreal"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés pour un 5@7 sans forcément avoir de réservation (c'est un 5@7!!). Il s'agissait de ma énième fois mais la première en tant qu'individu ou pas en tant qu'un membre d'une entreprise faisant un 5@7.
Ce fut assez décevant! 
Au départ, le serveur nous a demandé si nous avions une réservation et dans la négative, il a alors consulté son plan de salle. Après quelques minutes de réflexion, il nous a indiqué une table mais on sentait que cela ne l'arrangeait pas. 
Au final lorsque l'on est parti, la moitié de la salle était vide.... C'était bien la peine de faire mine de ne pas nous trouver de place! (1/5)

On a pris des petites choses à grignoter mais le choix était plutôt faible ... Seul un plateau de charcuterie et des mini burgers s'offraient à nous. Question choix c'est pas terrible (2/5) On les a pris mais ... Bof pas exceptionnel (2/5).
Donc cher (2/5) et pas super intéressant! ... 7/20. :("}
{"text":"Me too! We were in the area looking for a nice quick lunch. at 11:30AM we walked in and were promptly told all tables and the bar were full for lunch.

I was shocked that a restaurant which was completely empty, save one table of 2, would turn away 2 well dressed business people. But they did! recommending a reservation next time. 

Note to owner. There are enough other restaurants in the area that there will not be a next time for me.

So we heard the same story at the resto 1.5 blocks away, but they took us....

an hour later we walked by L'Appartement and guess what. Empty tables, not full bar. Two people not likely to come back any time soon.

Lesson for the owner. \"A Bird in hand is better than two in the bush\"

{"text":"Wow! So many bad reviews for this place! Must say it doesn't match my experience at all!

I was on my way to a dinner at a restaurant near by (a friend's pick) and I had an hour to kill so I was looking for a drink. Then a saw the sign that advertise oysters for $2 each... It was 6 pm on a Friday and the place was pretty much empty. I inquired to the hostess if I could just get a few oyster and a drink and she said \"off course\"!

She was very friendly, as the rest of the staff as I found out, and I asked her if there was a USB port to charge my iPhone 5... She said sure and already had the right wire so I didn't had to get mine out.

Atmosphere is warm, welcoming, cozy and friendly. I could certainly have spent the night here. Music choice was mellow and perfect for that kind of place.

I had a cava (the only bubbly by the glass. I had six delicious oyster with it and it all made for a perfect appetizer!"}
{"text":"I have not eaten here, but when in Montreal this is one of my favorite places to dance.

The few times I've gone, I've been in the basement. They have great DJ's and the bartenders are always wonderful. Drinks are pricey, but I suppose that's to be expected. Bartenders and patrons alike loved that my friend and I are from America, so this was a very welcoming and extremely fun environment. It also served as a great place to meet people in the area, and one time we even got invited to a roof party that they had. Very fun! Very swanky!

A great place to visit if you're from out of town and you're looking to get snazzed up and dance!"}
{"text":"I  have eaten and had drinks at Lappartement resto-lounge. The service and hosts and owner are all fabulous. Everything was amazing and the service was outstanding. The staff and crowd were friendly and fun. I have gone back regularly . I recommend the restaurant and the fun lounge. Five 5 Starts!! Excellent!!"}
{"text":"How are they in business is beyond me. Food is way overpriced, my dish was cold (eggs Benedict with congealed sauce and undercooked poached eggs (aka snot). The smoked trout was so cold it seemed  right out of the fridge and the English muffin  was toasted at least 3 hours ago.

A regular classic breakfast came with rock hard charred baguette. The size of the meals is ridiculously small for the price.  Do yourself a favor. Skip it !

The smoothie at $9 was laughable is was so watered down its crazy and they added blenderized bits of the orange pulp and rinds  that is left over from their orange juice press to add texture to their water and a few Blueberries for color and they think we won't notice!

One of us asked to order eggs Benedict without the smoked trout and cpuld they please just add a bit more potatoes...NOPE and extra potatoes will be charged ha!

A group of 4 we waited 20 minutes to be settled at the terrasse while many places were available just needed to be cleaned up which took so much time.

Then we waited to order for 15 miutes and waited a full hour to be served ... 60 long minutes and we HAD to ask for it. At the end of the meal we were given our invoices and we  had to wait exactly 20 minutes to be able to pay. RIDICULOUS 

Not once did they try to make amends for anything.

The staff never offered anything to compensate our waiting. Not a coffee not a  rebate not a thing."}
{"text":"So Resto L'appartement sucks.  While the establishment tries to be uber trendy it turns off customers who are actually more interested in the food than the fake vibe."}
{"text":"Le service était très ordinaire et, la nourriture acceptable en qualité, pas pour le prix. Un endroit pour draguer, selon moi, le royaume des implants en silicone et du superficiel. J'ai essayé et je ne suis pas un fan.

Désolé..."}
{"text":"Really really good salads ! Apple Boston lettuce salad was amazing, the sweet and salty was perfection.  Salmon with garlic kale and beet puree was delicious"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here a few times. I've found their table d'hotes to be decent. You will leave feeling full, especially if you take advantage of their unlimited bread. However, there's nothing especially memorable for me but for about 25$, you can enjoy a decent 3 course meal, great bread and nice surroundings at lunch time."}
{"text":"Je ne comprends pas  les mauvais commentaires. J'ai été quelques fois à L'appartement et j'ai toujours été agréablement surprise de la qualité de la nourriture. Les saveurs sont nouvelles et la cuisine assez moderne... Une joie pour les papilles gustative!!!.  Ma seule critique est peut-être par rapport aux portions... un peu petites. 
La clientèle est très variée et parfois un peu trop bruyant."}
{"text":"La première fois que j'y suis allée avec une amie, nous n'avions pas réservé. Le resto était pratiquement vide à notre arrivée, mais le serveur a tout de même pris la peine de vérifier les réservations avant d'accepter de nous recevoir. Même en lui disant qu'on quittait dans 1 heure maximum, on sentait que ça ne l'arrangeait pas vraiment. Qu'on le veuille ou non, nous nous sommes senties pressées de quitter.

Malgré cet accueil plutôt froid, j'ai trouvé le repas délicieux. J'y suis retournée 2 fois depuis ma première visite et mon choix s'est toujours arrêté sur l'entrée de tartare de bison aux figues, qui était tout simplement délicieux et amplement suffisant pour un repas lorsque accompagné de frites. Malheureusement, le choix ne semble plus figurer au menu pour l'été 2015. Vraiment dommage !

L'endroit est bruyant, le service est plutôt lent. En somme, j'allais à ce resto pour leur tartare de bison, mais je ne suis plus certaine d'y retourner maintenant que ce plat de figure plus au menu."}
