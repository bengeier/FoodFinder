{"text":"The best part about this restaurant is that everything is fresh, fresh, fresh! The tortas are loaded with delicious meats and fresh tomatoes, avocados, peppers, and other great veggies. My favorite were the roasted pepper vampiros, if you like it a little spicy, and the bionico, a cup full of wonderful fresh fruit topped with sweet milk, honey, nuts, granola and coconut. Prices were very reasonable and no one will leave here hungry!"}
{"text":"I accidentally found Torta Rica when I ventured away from the hospital where my best friend was in labor and hitting hour 22. Forget the upcoming birth of my nephew... I was hungry. I didn't have to drive very far to see the nice building that housed Torta Rica. I had remembered Ayesha's review and decided to pull over, and give them a try. I am so glad that I did! 

When I entered the restaurant, it was very nicely decorated and it was clean. I guess I was expecting a hole in the wall setting, so I was pleasantly  surprised at what I saw. 

I ordered La Torta Rica which comes stuffed with Carne Asada, bacon, grilled onions and chiles. It also comes with Mexican cheese (think fresh mozzarella), lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, and avocado! As you can probably imagine, the torta was HUGE. The bread it came on was soft and stood up well to all the juices that were mingling around inside.The torta was delicioso!  The carne was well seasoned and you could taste that it had been grilled. I topped the torta with guacamole salsa. It was spicy but not too hot. I was a very happy girl after eating the GIANT torta.
 
I didn't know the torta was going to be so huge so I made it a meal for 1.99 extra. That meant it came with rice, beans and tortilla chips. My advice, skip it. The rice and beans were not good. They were nothing amazing, don't even bother. The star is the torta and I promise you won't be hungry after you eat one.

It is a little pricy but it honestly is a big sandwich that you're eating with quality ingredients inside. I hope to return to Torta Rica sometime soon to sample more of their specialties!"}

Torta Rica is heavenly.  It is a true gem in the chaintastic land of 91st Ave. and Thomas Road.  The first time I went here, I made the mistake of ordering the nachos.  I wasn't impressed with them, and wrote this place off.  The second time I went here was with one of my favorite couples, both of whom happen to be Mexican.  The husband of the couple swears by this place and said he loves it so because it reminds him of the food served in his hometown region of Mexico.  This time I tried out the vampiros- similar to tostadas but so much better, as well as, a taco.  I was delighted with both the vampiros and taco.  Their shredded chicken is solid, which is a huge development because shredded chicken can often be shady.  I also enjoy their pollo asado.  

One of the things I love about AZ is that there are ample salsas bars at a variety of restaurants.  Torta Rica's salsa bar is chocked full of good choices- the red tomatillo one is my favorite because it is the perfect amount of flavor and heat.  The pico de gallo is bland, but I have no problem with that as I can supplement it with any of the other choices available.  

I've had margaritas on a couple of my visits and I stand unimpressed so I might pass on the margaritas and go for a cold bottled beer, instead.  They do, however, have a happy hour from 3-7, M-Thursdays.  Being able to make a good margarita is key, so they get dinged one star for that reason.  

This place has totally earned me as a regular customer.  I went here for lunch last Saturday and it was so delicious, I begged my dinner companion to go back with me, that same day.  That said, I haven't tried their namesake sandwich, but it is on the to-do list."}

Love - I love the vampiros, especially bean and cheese.  Also, bean and cheese burrito is quite good.  The tortilla is dense and if held separately I would imagine it has some weight to it.  

I like that they have numerous hot sauces to choose from, and the salsa bar has several options.  However, their builder is an idiot because nobody of average height can reach under the (misplaced) viewing glass and actually reach the back salsas.  You have to put your head under there or go around the side.  Stupid.

Hate - it takes a long time to get your food even when they're not busy.  There's also a blond kid that works there who is a smug little (can't use the c-word here, sorry).  Seems to work at close which is when I would like to stop by, but I can't stand this guy.  Man he's such a C."}
