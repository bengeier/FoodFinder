{"text":"Super cute bubble tea shop quite far from downtown. If some of my friends hadn't introduced me to this place, I probably would never have entered; nonetheless, they did, and I've been frequenting it ever since. Great drinks for the price, cute and welcoming interior, and super friendly staff. I'm not sure if this is a chain or not, but their drinks are overall higher quality than other shops I've tried in Montreal. Somehow, they always get the tapioca just right!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite bubble tea shop in Montreal. The staff is always friendly. Their drinks are 10/10! I also love their tapioca bubbles, it's so much better than other places."}
{"text":"Super nice owners, always ready to listen from feedback Bubble tea is very good, hot drinks also recommended! Top seller is Summer Paradise  A nice cozy place located near Du Collège metro and near Vanier College and Cegep St-Laurent. Makes you want to come again and again!"}
{"text":"Wow this has got to be the best bubble tea place i've ever been to. Spotless and well decorated shop. Friendly staff and the drinks are just amazing! What more can you ask for? For 4$ I got the best mango flavored slush in a GIANT size. Forget Starbucks, this is where I'll be going to the most this summer!"}
{"text":"I found this cute bubble tea shop while walking around Décarie, which a lot of cegep students from the area go to.  They have an interesting menu ranging from fruit to milk teas with some signature drinks I haven't seen in other bubble tea spots. You have the option to also mix flavours, creating your own, as well as choose your bubbles and sugar level! So, I decided to try their their Kyoto matcha and coffee mix, which are 2 of my favourite things, and it was delicious!!   If you're around the area, definitely try this place out!"}
