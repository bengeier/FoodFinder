{"text":"Sorry to discover that Joe's Kitchen is gone, as in moved out. No one seems to know where.  Too bad. The food was great, and Joe and Jenny were really nice. Hope they can find a new home.  Even if it is across town, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my dad for lunch. We split the duck soup with noodles and a roast pork banh mi. The banh mi was good, but nothing special: a nice slice of pork, some (pickled?) vegetables, cilantro, and mayo that looked and tasted homemade, served on a slightly toasted--but not especially crusty or dense--roll. The soup, however, was great: a big bird's nest of thin egg noodles swimming in real chicken broth, with big, bright green chunks of Chinese broccoli, chopped scallions, a few slices of red-painted duck breast, and a whole roasted duck leg quarter chopped into big chunks, bones included. 

Simple, tasty food cooked to order, and friendly service. It's a little odd to dine in the middle of a grocery, but you'll get over it."}
{"text":"The food is very authentic.  The chef was professionally trained in a cooking school in Hong Kong.  You will not be disappointing, well unless you like standard fair, which this is not.   The seating is spartan but you get this sense that you are in a different city for a moment.  One of the best secret restaurants you will ever find.  This will not be a secret for long.  The Chef specializes in Dim Sum, unfortunately this location is too small for them to make very much.  I am very excited to see them get their own place and get things going."}
{"text":"Had another wonderful dish last evening. I asked for Onchoy and Joe said they weren't fresh and so I asked him to cook any vegetable. He cooked a vegetable we never had before and it was amazing. My wife said she wants it again. 

Heads up - Joe's Kitchen is moving to West side of town and doing what he loves - dim sum! Let's give him and his family support to stay in Madison. In my 30 years in Madison, I have to say this is what I would consider as real Chinese cooking."}
{"text":"We took our food home and were very happy with our choices. Egg rolls were large and delicious. The price was only one dollar. Delightful! We had cashew shrimp. The shrimp were large and there was a delicious variety of vegetables . The chicken with mushrooms was outstanding. The portion was large and the sauce was superb. Best Chinese we have had in Madison."}
{"text":"They will make you items not on the menu.  Nice family-owned place and real Chinese food"}
