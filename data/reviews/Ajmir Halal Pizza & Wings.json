{"text":"Rarely answer the phone, and when they do - they may hang up on you.  Rarely do they offer delivery or payment other than cash.

A 3rd rate pizzaeria at best.

Suggestions for improvement: answer the phone during operating hours, offer delivery, accept debit and credit card payment for delivery, be professional!"}
{"text":"Cheap, greasy, stale, and not tasty with terrible customer service. I used to love Ajmir's Pizza but since they underwent new ownership last year this place has gone down the pits. With so many pizza options in the area, they've lost my business."}
{"text":"First time I went I had the pizza, oily, disgusting sauce just horrible (1 * for sure).  The second time I had an Afghani Chicken platter, which is Shubnum (the owner's specialty). I didn't like it at all, too heavy on the cumin and salt, dry kebab, overcooked rice. My family on the other hand LOVED it. Insanely enjoyed it, for under $10 it is better than Bamiyan but still not to my taste. Trust me you'll want to get takeout. The kitchen is immaculate but the dinning room could use some TLC. I'm giving it 3 stars solely on the extremely low prices (compared to Bamiyan) and mediocre attempt at Afghani food. I wouldn't go again but my family does often."}
{"text":"The prices are fair here. I would prefer to see this place tone down on the variety of food items and focus on one-two things, such as shawarma and wings. Until then i will have to decline on a return visit."}
{"text":"At this place, don't expect good service (you get what you pay for). But you can expect a delicious shawarma! They have a great deal, 2 for $8. I have eaten in LA and NYC,  and this is one of my favorite shawarma places ever. It is very underrated for sure. I highly recommend people looking for a cheap and delicious shawarma to come to this place. It's reminiscent of athe infamous Kennedy's ( not kentuckys, aka kfc, thats why its infamous) fried chicken joints from New York City."}
