{"text":"came here for lunch on an afternoon with a friend. 
the place is pretty small and tucked into the corner/elbow of this plaza. 
walked in and ordered the food that we were going to eat, I was really fascinated with how bright this little place gets, the floor to ceiling windows are a nice touch. 
the staff is really great and quick with the food, one of the tiny issues is sometimes they have people behind the counter where English isn't the native tongue, so sometimes mistakes happen. the pastries that this place cranks out are fantastic, I'm not sure what the eastern European secret is but man...fluffy...flavorful...aromatic. just absolutely awesome. 
if you are in the area, it is definitely a wicked place to come and check out, they also have a couple of racks of eastern European treats/beverages. 

lots of parking at this plaza, and transit options are the 111 bus. 

awesome place to come and grab a treat!"}
