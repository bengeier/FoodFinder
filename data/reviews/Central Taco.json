{"text":"Are you serious with this? I understand you're trying to take over whatever qubobo was doing, but can't you have some flair or personality of your own? The food sucks. I ordered the nachos. The chips were stale, the chicken had no flavor, and the nacho cheese was seriously watered down. They have no logo, the place is dark and dank, and the menu is confusing. I hate this place, I'm never going back."}
{"text":"This place is owned by the same man that owned the franchised Qdoba.  Been going to Qdoba for 15 years..it started to become hit or miss.  Now that it's Central Taco....downhill.  Some easy fixes maybe some seasoning in the beans (black and pinto), the grilled veggies and fajita veggies have absolutely NO FLAVOR. It's simple...flavor your food!!!! This place will be closed by end of year. Not consistent and food lacks any flavor. Quality check your food if you want to succeed."}
{"text":"A co-worker of mine recommended this place, so I had to check it out. I was impressed. It is clean, and has a wide variety of choices, yet simple menu. I like that you can choose toppings  such as mango and cucumber. The variety of Chickens (Kung Pao, Teriyaki, etc..) are delicious. The staff is friendly. Recommended :)"}
{"text":"This place is brand new opening up a day or so ago. As stated before, they took over where Qdoba was inbetween Starbucks and Thai Basil. I killed off my chai tea and since it was about 10am and this place opens at 10, I figured I'd grab a bite to eat. They just got done placing all the food out and it pretty much seems like Chipotle but everything else but burritos.   They told me to pick what I wanted and that pricing on the board was for 3 tacos. I asked them if I could have different proteins on each taco and they stated that it was fine. I picked Abobo steak, Spicy Korean Chicken BBQ and Teriyaki Chicken. I got about everything on all three though most people probably wouldn't. I put white rice on it, black beans, quacamole, corn, pico de gallo, and the spiciest salsa they have. It tasted fine to me. I really liked the Abobo steak and Korean BBQ Chicken. After two tacos, I was pretty full. I think the chai tea I had right before compounded.   I thought it was a little expensive for what it was...coming out to little less than $12 for three fat tacos and a large drink. Probably would've been sub-$10 if I didn't get the large soda. I did like the soda machine they had. One of the new ones that have single spout but have a touch screen so you can pick from like 20 different flavors. They were out of the Vanilla Coke I wanted.   There's plenty of seating inside and out with misters outside. There's wifi from next door Starbucks. Parking is plenty and there's places for hipsters to park their bikes.   All in all, not bad to try if you're in the mood for tacos and nearby."}
{"text":"Garbage. Pre cooked meat in a non working steam table. Confusing choices. Grocery store tortillas. My tacos were ice cold. So if you are in the mood for some tasteless cold tacos this is the place for you. And to top it off their fancy Coca Cola dispensing robot only dispenses water and tea. So if you would like to wash down your cold tacos with a nice refreshing draft soda..... Forget it."}
{"text":"Went to this place 3 times. One a few weeks ago and the experience was ok. Had the teriyaki chicken soft tacos and they were alright. Went there at lunchtime (around 11:00am) on 7/30/15 and their POS machine was down so they turned us away. Apparently they don't know how to write down orders on paper and use a calculator so they can still serve food. For a place that has just opened, turning away business so soon after you opened can't be afforded. Went there again today 7/31/15 since we figured we'd give them another shot with the POS nonsense. Arrived at 11:45am and the place was empty. 2 employees eating lunch in their dining room. I tried to order 3 soft tacos with bbq pork, Korean BBQ steak, and brisket. I was told they didn't have BBQ pork and brisket at the moment. Looked down and half their serving area was devoid of food. Ended up getting steak soft tacos and when I was paying I wanted a fountain drink. They told me their fancy new touchscreen fountain drink station only had diet selections. Uhh, alright then. Went to go to the fountain station and tried selecting diet root beer. Pressed the button once and got about 1/4 cup of soda and apparently the machine ran out and the root beer was now grayed out. Tried the 'all drinks' option and of the 3 pages of choices you could choose from only 4 drinks actually were available.  This place needs some serious management oversight. POS machines going down, food options not available, and fountain machines having hardly any soda? Who is paying attention there?  I gave 2 stars because the food is actually decent (when they have it)"}
{"text":"My burrito was good. Some of the veggies looked like they were sitting out a while (visible browning on some of the sliced zucchini in the steam tray).  Confusing menu, guy at the register gave me change for a 20 half in quarters and dimes :("}
{"text":"This place just opened up in the old Qdoba on Central Ave. Looks like the menu is still a little limited since they just opened less than a week ago, but what they have so far is great. They have some good variety in flavors with their tacos ranging from the more standard adobo chicken and steak, to teriyaki chicken, and spicy Korean BBQ steak, they even have some vegetarian options. They also have salads and quesadillas, I didn't try either so I can't vouch for them. Talking with the staff, who are super friendly by the way, it sounds like they are working on expanding their options as they go. I hope so, it'll keep me coming back to see what is new."}
{"text":"I'm not a picky eater, but central taco was terrible when I went. The meat smelled and tasted weird to me. They were out of literally over 60% of the menu items (and we went at noon). Their soda machine wasn't working either. Just a strange lunch experience. Won't be going back."}
