{"text":"A little taco/hot dog stand in the northeast corner of the Four Queens.

The prices are reasonable and the food is pretty tasty.

There are a lot worse places one could eat when drunk on Fremont Street.  Just sayin'"}
{"text":"Tried the carnitas quesadilla. So damn good I had to go back next night and get it again.
And the green salsa was AMAZING!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was kind of one of the first places we stumbled across along Fremont Street. They also had patio seating which we found 2 seats in front of this dancing Marilyn Monroe guy. So we enjoyed our dinner with some free entertainment lol. The menu here is very simple. You have 3 options for tacos or a Combo plate with a taco from each. No sides, nothing. They stuff the taco's with a good amount of meat, and they're slightly bigger than your traditional street tacos which isn't a bad thing. Not too bad for a taco place on Fremont Street I guess."}
{"text":"If you are staying at 4 Queens Hotel in the old Fremont Strip in Vegas, you gotta grab some authentic Mexican food.  They are located at the corner of the hotel that's outside facing the Fremont Strip. You can sit outside while you enjoy the weather or ppl watch as you eat.  Or you can eat inside where there is A/C if it's too hot during the summer.  There is also an outside bar outside next to the restaurant so you can also grab some drinks while you eat.  

The hotel will give you coupon booklets which has a coupon offer of buy 2 entree combo for the price of 1.  The combo is a 3 item taco combos which you can choose from carne asada, chicken or pork.  Usually it's $6.49 for a 3 time taco. Price is reasonable since you are at Vegas.  But even worth it when you have the coupon for buy one get one free.   They heat up the tortilla fresh and the meat is also fresh.  I also like the freshly home made green sauce.   Unfortunately they don't have guacamole.   But they do have free salsa, lime, onions, cilantro and cheese that comes as toppings.  I highly recommend the chicken tacos.   It was super yummy with the moist chicken.  

Menu is simple and easy to order.  Aside from tacos which they are known for, they also serve nachos, hot dogs, quesadilla and cookies."}
