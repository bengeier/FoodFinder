{"text":"My fav place to eat at the Galleria Mall! My toddler is a picky eater.. I bring him here sometimes to eat his favorite fries. Customer service is also great.."}
{"text":"I love it! Whenever I go to the mall It will call me for a snack lol!! I  like their variety of flavors. Something different for me. Sweet potato fries is also amazing with cheddar and crisscut fry with barbecue flavor. The 2 combo I always get."}
{"text":"Just left this place located in the mall. As I was waiting to order patiently the owner did not even both to acknowledge my presence. After he glanced at me clearly waiting to order he continued to avoid greeting me as if he did not want to take my order. I love potato corner, but not this location."}
{"text":"I feel like consistency is key and they just don't have it. Sometimes I'll get giga tots and the cup will be overflowing other times it barely reaches the rim. Sometimes they will have HELLA flavoring on them like too much, other times they have like barely any on them. Sometimes they're piping hot and crispy, other times they're as soggy as old cereal. I really like when they get it right because my mouth is like in heaven, But I feel like my negative experiences out weigh my positive. Also, I understand that they're in a little hut, it gets really stuffy and smokey and they can't keep their door open because town square is the most anal shopping center I've ever worked in and I was in a store, but just wanted to throw it out there that it's not that hard to be friendly when you're being paid for it, stop acting like every single customer is an inconvenience and smile once in a while and maybe your tip jar wouldn't always be empty. The galleria location is much more consistent and friendly so if you're really craving some good spuds go there."}
{"text":"Potato corner is my go-to place to get tater tots! The staff are so friendly and the fries are always crispy! Fresh and delicious :)"}
{"text":"Been here several times and this last time was the worst.. Bought a giga fries and the girl said it'll be ready in 30 seconds.. =\   After she packaged the fries I left and when I got to my car (which was around the corner) they were completely stale and cold.. Called the phone number to their location and the phone just kept on ringing.. Finally got ahold of someone and she was just speechless on the phone.. Literally speechless.. We were loyal customers but after this.. I don't know if I'll come back and support this business due to their customer service"}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago with a friend, we ordered 2 giga fries. It was over priced ( like $12 something) but We didn't care until we got our food. So little portion and there was barely any fries. Also the wait was a huge disappointment too. We asked the girl how long the way would be because we were in a hurry to go see our movie she said it'll be 3-5 mins wait but it took way more than 10 mins for us to get our food ( even though there was just one person in front of us)"}
{"text":"Potatoes have to be one of my favorite foods in the whole world! In any shape or form they are absolutely delicious! Potato Corner has quite a few shapes of French fries to choose from! On top of that they even have baked potatoes! So far I haven't been a fan of any of the powdered flavors I've tried so I get them plain! So fresh and hot every single time! Will go here every once in awhile for a treat! :)"}
{"text":"Really good food and great service. Shout out to Mikey and Bianca for their friendliness and smiles. Will be coming here again."}
{"text":"I rarely come here because it's in the mall and I don't really go to the mall BUT when I do this is a must have! They have many different kinds of favors and types of fries/potatoes! I am a potato lover so this is perfect!"}
{"text":"After learning from a friend that this place is very popular in the Philippines where it was founded, I decided to try it out. They use a seasoning powder to flavor the fries and can actually be really salty so make sure to get a drink. Also they have a rewards card and you can get free food pretty often if your a regular. They also have chicken wings and fingers that are pretty tasty with the ranch and buffalo dip. I Would highly recommend the loopy fries with cheddar seasoning."}
{"text":"Well ... there I was, killing a little time while the Orchid was finishing up her excursion to Charming Charlie's in the Meadows Mall.  So, I thought a snack and a drink were in order.  I had seen this Potato Corner place, and decided to give it a try.  (I noticed that they carried \"tater tots\" along with traditional French fries; if I hadn't seen them, I might have gone elsewhere for the snack.)  I ordered the tots (parmesan/garlic) and a diet cola.  I am not sure exactly what was in the powdered flavoring they put on the tots, but it kinda burned my tongue a bit.  (Disclosure note:  The Great Bearded Bird is a garlic-eating fool; I'm not sure what that taste was, but \"garlic\" it certainly was not.)  Even the soda tasted a bit off ... and this was before I tasted the tots.  Maybe I'll try another flavor ... or maybe I'll try fries instead of tots ... but it certainly won't be for a while, if at all.  A tingly-burning sensation on the tongue is definitely NOT what I snack for. -- -- -- -- -- On the newly-established Nighthawk 100-point scale: 20."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find the owner behind the counter but he was very hands on. I had never been to a potatoes corner and was hesitant to try flavors but he was helpful gave me samples to try. The wings were flavorful and crispy   I prefer crispy the flavor was AWESOME. My onlydissappointment was they forgot my poppers which after tasting the wings iwas exvited to taste. The fries i tried were the parmesan and again dud not let me down.   Again if you've never been try the wings, original fries eith parmesan or sour cream. Next time im majing sure to grt the poppers."}
{"text":"Great location and awesome staff! The wait is a little longer than normal, but it's definitely worth it. In the past month I've been in Vegas I've gone to this place at least once a week. They have a great chicken combo that I just discovered in their Town square location and its decent amount (choice of 3 or 5 I believe) plus theyve always thrown an extra piece every time I've gone. My favorite out of the three I've tasted so far is Garlic Parmesean. HANDS DOWN THE BEST FRIES I'VE EVER TASTED!"}
{"text":"Best spot for fries! Absolute must try!!! Variety of flavors and options to suit your taste buds!! Great service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite potato places around! But today just wasn't a good day for this place. I ordered chili cheese tots with seasoning. Then when making my food they forgot the seasonings which usually I wouldn't mind but it kind of bothered me that every. Single. Employee. Was sitting on their phones while making my food. Maybe call me old fashioned but I don't use my phone at work because it's very unprofessional. Granted they are all teenagers but that's still not an excuse. So my entire lunch break has been wasted now waiting for one simple order all because phones seem to be more important. They really need to enforce some more rules. Or hire adults who won't use their phones every 5 seconds. But my food was amazing as always. Too bad the employees aren't."}
{"text":"Used to snack on these bad boys back in the Philippines so glad they finally opened one here. Though there's only a couple of locations but it's stil worth it. BBQ flavored fries are my favorite. But sour cream & onion is also good as well. Hopefully they'll open more stalls in the future!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. For a little kiosk with 3 people working.. There should be no excuse for the service I just received. They all literally stood in the back while I stood at the window for 5 additional minutes to order something else. Jeanne while using profanity to her other staff members was not friendly. I waited about 10 minutes to get my food and I wasn't even handed my drink.  She could tell I was a little irritated so she took my bag of food and slammed it down on the pick up window and didn't say a thing. My first ever experience here being a mall employee.. And I won't give my money to them again."}
{"text":"What a gem finding this. Didn't think I'd have it again since I moved from Manila a decade ago. You basically order what size you want,  what type of potato then what type of seasoning!  You must try it! The fries are made to order so it's a bit of a wait but I don't mind. Fries comes out so crispy and fresh. They're generous on the seasoning and portion too! The smallest size is actually pretty big.   I suggest mixing BBQ & Sour Cream, it's the ultimate best. Trust me."}
{"text":"This place never fails to deliver great service. Today was the perfect example of that. Michael, the manager of this location, is always friendly and handles himself well under pressure. On a busy Sunday afternoon he was the only member of his team working and he still was able to deliver our food in a timely manner. If your looking for great service and food  this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"World famous flavored fries? Okay, I'm intrigued. I've seen another stand at Meadows Mall but have no idea if this is a chain, or a local chain, or what. They make fresh fries, add a powdered seasoning of your choice, and dipping sauces. Apparently now they also offer chicken in the form of wings, tenders, and bites.  Chicken Bite Combo comes with a mega (medium) sized fry, a drink, and a dipping sauce. The loopy fries are fun, portion is large, and the garlic-parm dust was fragrant but not overpowering. Bites seemed beer-battered, white meat, better quality than expected.   Service was polite, when directly addressing them. Not especially friendly, a bit slow, but would keep this stand in mind for a snack the next time I'm at this mall.  TIP: they have a check in discount ($2 off a wing combo) and a Yelp deal ($8 for $15) available."}
{"text":"I had a 10:30am appointment with a movie, so I decided to stop here for a little sustenance first.  There was absolutely no wait at 10am, the girl at the stand was cute and my order took less than 5 minutes.  The food was fine, although there's plenty to choose from and go back and try (traditional, curly, tots, chips, the works) as well as chicken strips and wings.    The moral of the story?  Sometimes being a lonely loser with nothing else better to do in the morning has its benefits.  Or something."}
{"text":"I came by today..was very upset on how this guy made my  Giga Cheddar/Sour Cream and Mega Cheddar/Sourcream! :(( Ufortunately, i didn't try my ordered fries when I got in a To go bag..not until I got in rhe car with my son. Psshh! Drove there for lame a** flavored frenchfries!!! THEY SEEMED TO BE UNTRAINED . NO TASTE AT ALL! NO FLAVOR! FYI EMPLOYEES!! POTATO CORNER IS KNOWN FOR FLAVORED FRENCH FRIES!!! They need to be trained again pleeaasssseee!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! French fries are MY THING so of course I love this! My fav is the loopy fries with sour cream and onion mixed with chili bbq! Oh my goodness, I would get them everyday of I could! They also have a rewards program too, so don't pass them up next time you are at the mall, you can thank me later!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were at the mall with our granddaughter and decided to try this since they offered chicken fingers. We walked up and the girl at the counter was staring off into space and I had to stand there for a few seconds, finally saying hello to her to get her to acknowledge us. I began to give her order of a 2 piece kids meal and a 3 piece meal for myself and then my husbands order. She was not paying attention AT ALL and I had to repeat myself several times to get through the order. We paid and went and sat down to get our granddaughter settled before the food came. My husband went to wait for the order and witnessed one of the girls kneeling down behind the counter vaping of all things. He finally got our order and came to sit down with it, and it was not correct. She'd given us 2 kids meals and not my 3 piece meal like I had told her. I didn't even bother mentioning it because I was already so irritated by the ordering process.. I then realized he had not gotten napkins so I went back to get some and the girl who he'd gotten the order from was sitting there with her phone in one hand thumbing through Facebook and the other with a vape in her mouth. WTF??? The food itself was ok. I think a bit over priced for what you got. I just know after this experience we won't be back and we won't recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"They decided to stop making fries at Great Steak at 830p, so my husband used it as an opportunity to try Potato Corner's french fries.   The chili-barbecue fries with shredded cheese totaled $5.50.  We would have been more pleased if we didn't feel duped. The fries are placed in folded parchment paper and then that cone is dropped into a cup. The trick is, it's like a bouquet of flowers... The potatoes bloom out at the top, but the bottom of the cup is empty.  Not worth $5, but very tasty."}
{"text":"Flavored fries: cheddar, sour cream, BBQ, and parmesan cheese. I like the regular fries but they have all sort of fries like waffle fries, curly, and sweet potato. I'm always satisfied with their service. Also, they have a point system where you get a point every 3$ you buy. Once you get 10 points, you get a Mega fries for free"}
{"text":"I walked right by this place while I was shopping at the Galleria and decided to try it because it reminded me of a franchise in Japan called 'First Kitchen'. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite as good for me.  I ordered the Chicken Tenders combo which gives you 3 pieces of chicken, mega fries, and a soda for $8.99 I think it was. The fries were good, but not that spectacular. Seems like it's just salted with flavored salt. There are some variety of shapes of fries you can choose from as well, such as curly fries. They are made to order which is good.  It's located on the second floor of the Galleria right in front of Dick's Sporting Goods if you have trouble finding it because it's not part of the main food court. This joint is kinda far for me, so I probably won't be frequenting it very much, but if you are in the Galleria, it's definitely worth trying once."}
{"text":"I love potato corner! I go there all the time. I always get giga original fries with an extra scoop of sour cream and onion seasoning. It's made to order, so fries are always fresh and crispy! The seasoning is amazing!! I have converted many friends over to potato corner. ask them to toss their wings in the seasoning for you -- you'll love it. The stand is super popular now so there's always a line when I go...that's probably the only downside for me (but obviously good for them) haha.  The owner is always super nice and his employees are really sweet. I love potato corner so much that I'm often using postmates to deliver it to me. I'm that crazy about it."}
{"text":"Changing price again and again. Right now, one fries' price is same as a hamberger combos in Mc. Reduced a quantity of fries and wings. Poor cashier service. I just break down $20 bill for paying 1cent."}
{"text":"Not sure yet I purchased this off of Groupon and first mistake was mine because I thought they closed at 10 pm but once i found the place which is in the mall I pulled my Groupon up and it said they closed at 9 so I rushed in there.  If I would of known they were close to closing I would of went there another day but since I was there I rushed got there at 8:53 and unfortunately they said they were closed.  They take the last order at 8:45.  I'm still giving 5 stars just because I know how much 4 stars can take your rating down.  I don't want to do that because I'm sure the food is great!  The employees were even friendly! I'm only writing this so others know it's already a pain to go to the second floor of the mall but for it to be closed when its posted 9 was a little annoying"}
{"text":"First potato corner in Las Vegas! If you have try it go this place is great and customer service is top! Sample sample sample please! You can sample all the flavor too!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm potatoes deep fried and flavored ANY WAY YOU WANT!!!"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed with this Potato Corner...  I've been to other ones and this kiosk Potato Corner just did not do the job for me.  The cashier was unfriendly and definitely hated working there.  My wings were enthusiastically bland, over fried, and did NOT have any chicken meat on there.  I think it's time for a Franchise manager to stop by this store and evaluate its standard.  Please and thank you."}
{"text":"Potato Corner is a chain that specializes in seasoned french fries. It's a popular concept in Asia. To order you first have to choose your size (go BIG or go home!). Then you can choose your type of fries-- tots, regular fries, curly fries, chips, etc.  Finally, you choose your seasonings. My favorite combination is the sour cream seasoning on the curly fries but on my last visit the guy who took my order suggested mixing BBQ and the sour cream together. Didn't even know I could mix the two, so that was a game changer!   They also sell chicken tenders and wings, but I would pass on both. The wings were super tiny and it wasn't worth the calories. I would save the stomach space for more fries!  A combo with regular sized fries & a drink will cost you around $5. I would suggest you check out the Yelp deal or the Groupon before you get your potato fix on. It's the perfect savory, mall snack for when you take a break from your retail therapy."}
{"text":"I love the BBQ fries but the wait to get them is so long. They need to have more ppl working. I don't like the chicken either. It's like they overcook them. Chicken tenders are great for the kids."}
{"text":"I love all their flavors. Fries are delicious. The worker Michael is real professional and nice. My favorite fries are the garlic Parmesan. Always a great place to stop by when I'm at the galleria mall."}
{"text":"Every Filipino knows and loves Potato Corner because they are all over the Philippines. I was walking into the Silverton Casino when out of the corner of my eye I spotted part of a Potato Corner fries bucket sticking out of the trash. I couldn't believe it, could there be a Potato Corner in Las Vegas? I immediately consulted Yelp and found that indeed there was one in the Town Square Mall near the airport. I convinced my hubby to drive there immediately and I eagerly ordered the GIGA (largest size) bucket of Barbeque fries. It was like being in heaven and I was sooooo happy. If you like French fries as much as I do please go and make your mouth happy at Potato Corner."}
{"text":"I love the bbq original fries, but the manager is rude AF and seems very impatient with questions.  Also, I saw her yelling at the workers brutally. Gosh, I felt so bad for the workers there!"}
{"text":"The potato corner in town square was great.  This one how everest is a bad surprise.  I ordered the chillin cheese fries and there was plenty of fried but not enough chilli making it feel dry. And the fries were a little over cooked.  My jaw was tired by the end if eating them and I haven't even started the chicken yet. My friends BBQ fries were way softer! Now the chicken was great.  Tender white meat and crunchy breading. To bad my jaw was worked out by the fries lol."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon a little bit ago & forgot to Yelp. Groupon made for a good price for what would seem a tad high for this menu. Chicken tenders & fries were both good. Hot, fresh & tasty. As chicken strips & fries go, probably 3 1/2 stars. But this is a mall food court... I believe it was the owner who took our order. Friendly & informative. Our order took a bit to come out but they were busy.   Fast food is not at the top of my list but this is worth a try."}
{"text":"The only reason why I go to the \"Ghettows Mall\" is because of THIS.  I'm so glad it's finally made its way to Vegas. (They just recently opened up a new location at Town Square.)  Those who know me knows my weakness are potatoes. French fries, baked potatoes, roasted potatoes, mashed potatoes....I love them all. I just can't resist. So this place is almost like  heaven for me.  You can get french fries, sweet potato fries, potato chips, curly fries or tator tots. What makes Potato Corner stand out from your normal fries you typically get is their seasoning!!!!! My goodness!!! They got flavors like sour cream and onion, cheese, Parmesan and garlic, BBQ, BBQ chili and a few more. Their size names kinda throws you off: jumbo for a small, mega for a medium and giga for a large. At about $4 and some change, I get a mega tator tots with BBQ chili seasoning. Def satisfies any potato cravings I have!   If you come on the weekends, be prepare to have a looooooonggggg wait. They make your order fresh. Sometimes, I see a line of about 10 people long. And that's just the order line. Then you got some more waiting to do while they make your order. But the best time to go to the mall is on a weekday anyways."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place because I LOVE potatoes! My favorite combination is a giga size sweet potato mixed with BBQ & sour cream flavors together. So delicious! Also, great to get the Groupon if they have it available, so always check. The last one I purchased was a deal for 3 $5 worth each for less than $9 on groupon = saved even more money on delicious potatoes."}
{"text":"So I came over here on my lunch because some of the girls at work said their potatoes are sooo good. I've had their tater tots and wasn't impressed. Honestly I think sonic tater tots are way better. Theirs were dry.   But this time I wanted a baked potato. The giant menu says chilli cheese and I ordered chilli cheese baked potato and added sour cream. The girl said its a chilli potato cheese is extra.  but the sign says chilli cheese not chilli. She said its chilli cheese is extra. I said fine add cheese then. So I pay 30 cents more for cheese and 30 cents more for sour cream. That's bullshit! Don't put on your menu chilli cheese baked potato and charge extra for cheese. And not only did she not have a cheese button to charge me for it was add chips!!!   I waited 20 minutes for this baked potato and she didn't even put it in a bag. Instead I had this really hot plastic container to carry back to my work. It was literally playing hot potato all the way back. The potato wasn't even good and I had wasted half of my lunch buying the damn thing. Yes I am still angry that it cost me over $5 for a rubbery baked potato and all I have to show for it was half of my lunch hour wasted and burnt hands.   Don't waste your time or money at this place. I won't. And I plan on telling everyone I work with every time someone asks about this false advertising place."}
{"text":"French fries are awesome with bbq flavoring. Customer service sucks idk if the workers are tired or what but the workers never smile and the pricing we pay for the amount of fries given. For their largest (giga) size cost about 6-7 dollars and the amounf given isnt even generous. When i can go to mcdonalds and buy 3 large fries for 7 dollars. But i still end up going here because i take my son to play in the play park right next to it.  I wouldnt get the curly fries it tasted weird when i last ordered it. So from now on i just order regular style fries."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm just not that into them. Them meaning the French fries, they seem like the same old thing I make at home for half the price, but with powder seasoning. So, with that being said I'm just not that into it.  But what I am into, is all the additional items this location offers such as Tater Tots, Curly Fries, Chili Fries and Chicken wings. I am also into the way the Fried items are cooked which is they are actually not fried they are air fried which means no grease!  Perfect  When ordering fries you have three options in size and several options for toppings I went with Sour Cream and Onion ummm and the smallest French Fries option. I was able to get a deal from  (Groupon which was $9.00) for three French Fries totaling $5.00 in value.  This is a great way to try this place out for the first time.  Why am I not into this place? The seasoning taste to artificial for me. I enjoy real garlic and chives etc. real butter.. I can't Handle  the powder stuff."}
{"text":"Delicious fries. My only complaint is that they were a little too seasoned. I tried the garlic parmesan in the mega size, which was a good portion for two people. They also had ketchup, Sriracha mayo, and different hot sauces, so you can add flavor to them yourself. Any other dressings like ranch are an additional 65 cents."}
{"text":"I didn't know seasoned fries could be so addictive until I tried Potato Corner!  When I go there, I'm usually served by my favorite Asian fry guy, Michael, who always prepares my order perfectly hot and crispy and loaded with all that extra seasoning I've come to crave every few weeks. :D  Until Michael offered me a free sample of the sour cream 'n onion flavored potato chips the first time I passed by his kiosk, I never thought there could be anything special about a French fry shop. And then, I tried the chili Bbq, Bbq, and sour cream 'n onion mixed with Bbq on the regular fries, loopy fries, and tater tots, and I just couldn't stop myself from returning for more!   It does take about 7-10 minutes to make the fries to order and depending on how many people are ahead of you in line, but potato lovers know that fresh fries are really worth the wait! I've noticed though that I get the most consistency with my order if Michael is behind counter. He's a bit of the quiet type, but polite and professional; he'll remember you as a regular customer and bring the fries to your table too if you're sitting nearby. The teenager staff are friendly, but sometimes, my fries made by them would be under-seasoned or taste like it was saturated with old oil. I always hope to see Michael (who seems to work at the kiosk most days) when I'm needing my fry fix at the Galleria mall. Also, don't forget to redeem your FiveStars rewards after earning enough points for a free Mega fry or combo deal!"}
{"text":"I did not know they would have this place here in America because they only have this in the philippines! It taste amazing guys, i recommend everyone to come check it out! So yummy :)!! And their portioning is already alot even just for a small size! And the customer service is amazing. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"There is always a line at Potato Corner, but with the amount of seasoning and the (huge) portions they give you, it's hard to complain.   3 stars because it annoys the crap out of me when I see workers on their phone when it's busy. I wouldn't mind if it were just a two or three person line, but when seven+ customers are waiting, you need to put in work! You can tweet about how busy it is after the rush, lol!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find and try this place. I first attempted to go at the Meadows Mall branch since it was closer to us but I think that place is closed.   This made me think of home but even the branches in the Philippines didn't have this many choices.   Love the curly fries and I think it's best without any flavor cause on its own I think it's seasoned well. The regular fries are the best with one of their flavor choices and absolutely love their sour cream.   They now serve chicken so I am looking forward to trying that next time. Price isn't so bad either."}
{"text":"SO MANY DIFFERENT FRIES  **2016 YELP 100 LV CHALLENGE #8**  This is a cute little KIOSK in the middle of town square where the park is located. The staff that work here are SUPER nice!   I got the CHICKEN FINGER combo w/ cajun fries & a lemonade.... i was SUPER disappointed... the fries were decent & they had some flavor but it didn't really taste like cajun... the CHICKEN was the biggest disappointment.... it literally just tasted like chicken mcnuggects from mcdonalds put together & turned into bigger chicken fingers. if i wanted chicken mcnuggects i would have just gone to mcdonalds & got them for cheaper & way more.  I have tried the wings before & i loved them, so probably only go back from the wings & curly fries."}
{"text":"There seemed to have been an emergency so I had to wait a while before I was entertained. Either way, I had to wait quite a long time before I could have my wings and fries... but MAN OH MAN! It was still worth the wait! This has always been a favorite since I was 12. Worth a visit :)  Tip #1 : if you're in Galleria just for Potato Corner, park at Dick's go to the 2nd floor and exit. You won't miss it.  Tip #2 : Dick's closes their gates at 9pm, so we had to walk a long way back to Dick's parking lot... so we found a better spot to park.. the Foodcourt parking"}
{"text":"I like it.  They prep and cook it in that little shack.  Cool thing about potatoes is it makes me full without eating so much.  I found the seasoning choices to be a good variety, and the style of potato.  I had the JoJo chips ummm yeah cuz some of my friends call me JoJo ppptthhhh.  They're good!  Spicy, crunchy, freshly cooked and addicting.  So I can't be spending $4 for a small baggy of fresh potato chips everytime, you know.    To try at least once in a while, I'd say go for it.  Pick an unusual flavor though.  And checkout the different cuts.  Go on be a potato head!  It helps kill time walking around Town Square."}
{"text":"All I have to say is i keep coming back to this spot.  I first tried this place in the Philippines  where this company is originally from.. and was excited to see it pop up here in Vegas !! I was  impressed with the flavor in the seasoning used but the sour cream and onion was my go-to.  They have several to choose from... highly recommend this spot .... addicting to say the least lol"}
{"text":"The BBQ seasoning is amazing on their tater tots. That is probably the only positive comment I have. The prices seem very high for their smallest side of fries it's upwards of $4. Although they do have very good fries, tots, and chicken poppers, the price makes me hesitant to keep coming back. The customer service at Potato Corner is also sub par. The woman working at the time couldn't open the shack on time and seemed annoyed that she had people there that wanted to order. She told me to come back in ten minutes, which was almost half an hour after they opened. When I did end up ordering, she seemed rude and like I was a bother to her. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because that BBQ seasoning is my new favorite fry seasoning."}
{"text":"I know they're known for their fries, which are very satisfying with the array of seasonings to choose from, but I really enjoyed their chicken tenders.  Overall, it's a good spot in Town Square if you're looking for alternative options from all the restaurants nearby.  However, be mindful of the wait!  It's a quick bite joint, but not so quick."}
{"text":"I like the fries here. Always great service. You can get hot, fresh fries in different flavors and styles. My favorite is the garlic parmesan.  Their chicken wings are also good. They have Icee here as well (Cherry & blue raspberry).  You can connect with them through the Fivestars app to get discounts & deals on foods. E.g. $5 fry-days ($5 on fries) Wing Wednesdays (12 wings for $5)."}
{"text":"Awesome fries (I love sour cream and onion and cheddar), and the wings were amazing as well! :) Had to get another giga fries and mixed the sour cream and onion and cheddar together. The fries were so fresh and crispy! Truly made to order. The staff was so accommodating and friendly. Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"i love the product hate the wait! My go to is always the Original style with Bbq and cheddar flavors... so yum ! It's just no matter when I come the wait is such a hassle"}
{"text":"When I visited the Philippines I always snacked on these. You couldn't get it anywhere else. Now they finally have one at home in vegas!"}
{"text":"If your yelp or google tells you the closest one to you is the one at Town Square, drive the extra miles to this location because theyre on point! I prefer this location since theyre more friendly and their fries taste better altogether. They dont skimp out on the flavoring - i pay the extra one at town square but still not enough - and this place is just right. However you like it done. Trust theyll do it.  This location is worth the drive! :D love the bbq flavoe"}
{"text":"Who's on your corner?   Potato Corner is in my corner :)   I love love love the fries here at Potato Corner. I first knew of this place because when I visited the Philippines they had one there and I enjoyed it. The fact that they opened one here inside the Galleria Mall in Las Vegas I was too excited to have it again.    2 main reason's why I'm giving Potato Corner 5 stars and highly recommend it is because...  1.) I'm very impressed how consentient this company is.  I ordered the Giga (Large) fries with 2 different seasoning mixed together (Barbecue & Cheddar) and omg it made my day! Tasted just like I had it in the Philippines. It brought back great memories.   2.) Customer service was very impressing. From when they took my order to when I received my bucket of YUMMY fires.   They have other delicious foods to pick from but the fries are my all time favorite.   TIP: Be sure to sign up for their rewards program for free stuff :)"}
{"text":"They lucky I love the fries here cause if I didn't \"I would NEVER come back\" They have young adults (kids) working here and so with that being said, don't expect customer services because they have NONE!  The employees were rude and very inconsiderate. It took forever (20 mins) to get my fries and when I got them, it was not cooked all the way. They were very gushy and uncooked. $7 down the drain! I told them about it and they answered \"It's looks cooked to me\".   I didn't have anymore time since I waited 20 mins for my fries, to speak with a manager or get them redid. Horrible!!!!  Tip: Barbecue and cheddar is my favorite."}
{"text":"I have never been given such bad service from anyone who worked here until today. The employee serving me was not only impatient when taking my order, but was also rude and gave me attitude when I couldn't understand what she was saying, even when I politely asked her to repeat herself.  The fries that I ordered tasted good. However, upon finishing my order, I noticed a piece of hair tangled in one of the fries. How disgusting."}
{"text":"Potato corner offers fried potato snacks that are dusted in delicious flavors. They offer fries, tater tots, chips, and curly fries. They have flavors like cheddar and sour cream with onion. They make everything to order and have a small, medium, and large option. I felt compelled to write a review for this chain because of the sweet employee who helped me. It was just a pleasant experience.   I recommend tater tots with cheddar powder!"}
{"text":"The service was extremely friendly and helpful Isaiah was completely on top of his game even when he was by himself with a huge line. He was always friendly and gave 10/10 in customer service. With the food being delicious and great service I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Besides putting way too much seasoning on them, The french fries are good.   The cooking process is pretty cool, they go in to a drawer on top and they get dropped out of the bottom.    I do feel like they're overpriced, I paid $3.77 for about 30 small french fries. ( least expensive item)."}
{"text":"Pretty good fries. Container is misleading. You think you're getting this big bucket of fries but it's just because they use a paper to hold the fries up out of the container so it looks big. I wish they would have more condiments and in a better location. I felt rushed trying to get my ketchup with the person behind me waiting to pay. Good fries but the business could use some work."}
{"text":"Took 20 mins to make French fries and they were not even fully cooked. I am obsessed with French fries and would not order from here again. Not worth 20 min wait at all"}
{"text":"This is the First time that I have Tried this Place! And, I gotta say...Yum! In Case Any of You are Wondering Exactly What Potato Corner is (or if you have Never heard of it, Like Me) I Shall Break it Down for Ya!   It is Basically a Shop that Sells French Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, Cross-Cut Fries, Curly Fries, and Layered Potato Fries! Oh, and Baked Potatoes..lol! You can have them Plain, or they could Season them for you! I had the Garlic, Parmesan, and Cheddar Cheese Seasonings!   This location is in the Middle of Town Square in Las Vegas. In one of those Little Snack Shacks ( I Believe Potato Corner is Facing Blue Martini or Fossil)  Oh, One More thing....They do have a Lunch Plate, or a Combo Plate with Chicken Fingers, but that's all! Just Chicken Fingers... =)  **Side Note, they do Charge for Sides for the Baked Potato....I think it's $.30 for each Topping!"}
{"text":"Saw this little place and just had to try it! It took me forever to decide on what I wanted but there was a line so I had a lot of time to think it over. I decided to get the chili cheese tots. Chili wasn't spicy and the cheese was melted all over!!! It was delicious!!   The food was absolutely amazing but the service could be better. There was only one girl working and there were a bunch of customers who all came at the same time. She had to run back and forth from the cash register to the fries. (They make the fries very well so the process takes a little bit. You can watch them make it though the window). She was absolutely amazing! A few people were telling her, \"Keep up the great work! You're doing well with the crowd.\" With that being said.. they need to hire more people!! A second lady came out to the cash register 10 minutes after I got there but I think they could still use more help.   I can't wait to go back there to try the BBQ and the sour cream and onion seasoned fries. I'll just bring a book with me next time for the wait! (Not exaggerating.. It takes a while for you to order and then it's a long wait for it to become ready.)"}
{"text":"Sorry guys I can't give this place the 5 stars that everyone is giving. I just can't.    Ok don't get me wrong, this place is good. Everything is made to order so your food is hot and fresh. I've tried all the flavors already and my favorite has to be the BBQ and cheddar mixed together. The employees are nice and I get my mall employee discount.   The reason for the 3 stars is the pricing. I got a kids meal with 2 small pieces of chicken and fries for $6. Like I said, it's good, but not the $6 good. And after a while of eating the same flavor, it gets old so I don't even finish everything.   I don't frequent potato corner even though I'm next to it, but I'll be back if I'm hungover again."}
{"text":"Potato Corner... The best filipino junk food EVER! Love the mega fries with sour cream & onion + cheddar..."}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite filipino snack. Love jumbo sour cream & onion and cheddar cheese fries!"}
{"text":"The ultimate pair to a good burger, french fries have always been enjoyed alongside a burger, pizza, wings, etc... But this place for the longest time offered only french fries because french fries don't need anyone. French fries are independent and doesn't need a man, a woman, or some piece of meat to be enjoyed.  Potato corner originally a Filipino shack has migrated overseas to America to be enjoyed but is the price tag worth the taste?  They offer i think 6 or 7 seasonings? Garlic parmesan and cheddar were two seasonings I got before which were good but for a mega size of fries for almost $7? When you can go to in n out and probably get 3 fries at that price with spread. These fries aren't any different from normal fries. They're not fried like greek fries or prepared any different. It's just fries with seasoning.  For what it is, I don't think it's worth it. The fries are good but over priced."}
{"text":"In theory, the idea behind Potato Corner is genius- taking the humble spud and making it into a deep fried dream. They serve a variation on the potato like french fries, curly fires, tots, etc along with fried chicken wings and strips. I love the idea of potato corner. It's novel and who honestly doesn't love crisp, fresh fries?!  It's located as it's own stand alone little entity next to the food court, so it's not too hard to miss. The menu is simple. You just choose which type of potato you want, the size, and the seasonings. They also have combos packs with wings or chicken tenders if you're looking for something for substantial. If you buy the combo, don't forget to check in on yelp to get $2 off your order!  We got the cheddar flavored tater tots with garlic parm curly fries. I really wanted to like the potatoe corner, but the seasonings really brought it down. Maybe I didn't choose the right seasonings, or maybe if I chose a different flavor, things would've have been a whole lot better. The cheddar was flavorless even though our order ended up looking highlighter orange. Looks were deceiving in this case. The garlic parm was decent, but in both cases, I probably would have just preferred plain curly fries and tater tots. The seasonings fell flat in my opinion, and I found myself trying to wipe off the powder.    Overall, I really liked the fries and tater tots itself. The seasonings weren't my favorite, and in the future, I'll probably just try a different flavor or get them plain. It's also a little pricey for what you get which is a bummer."}
{"text":"I came to this place after having yogurt. My sister recommended this place after remembering having it when we visited family in the Philippines. I, however, don't remember at all.  There was quite sizable line. We ordered the smallest size, jumbo. We got regular fries with garlic parmesan and the loopy fries (aka curly fries) with the chili BBQ (forgot the actual name) flavor.  The girl said it would take 5 minutes, which we were fine with. However, it took closer to 10 minutes, which we would've been fine with as well had she told us. But whatever, I'm not going to cause a scene over 5 minutes unless I was late to a movie or something.  The fries themselves are good, but nothing special. I could see the bags of frozen fries from the order window. They fry them up when you order and add the seasoning after.  The buckets looks small, but they filled them above the rim. They gave our fries in a to-go bag when we asked for it and offered us 2 cups of ketchup, which we gladly accepted.  Overall, a good place to catch a snack. Maybe even to get a snack that you can sneak into the theaters? So ladies, bring your oversized purses! Just make sure that you don't mind getting some salt and seasoning on them in case the fries spill."}
{"text":"Sizes: Jumbo, Mega, Giga  Original Fries: $3.49 / $4.49 / $5.99 Loopy (Curly) Fries: $3.99 / $4.99 / $6.49 Sweet Potato Waffle Fries: $4.49 / $5.49 / $6.99 Tater Tots: $3.49 / $4.49 / $5.99 Jo Jo Chips: $3.49 / $4.49 / $5.99  Chili Cheese Fries (only available in Mega $5.49). Toppings: sour cream, jalapeño, or bacon bits ($0.30/each).  Flavors: BBQ, Cheddar, Sour Cream & Onion, Chili BBQ, Cinnamon Sugar, and Garlic Parmesan  Dips ($0.65): Chipotle BBQ, Ranch, Honey Mustard, and Thousand Island  You choose the type of fries and size and you can add a flavor (included). Condiments (called Dips) other than ketchup are an extra 65 cents.   We opted for the Giga size of Loopy Fries with Garlic Parmesan ($6.49). It's a bit pricy for frozen fries and seasoning, but a decent snack. The Garlic Parmesan was heavy, but very tasty and the curly fries were delicious. As a fry lover, having a kiosk where several types of fries are easily available is amazing. I would definitely stop by again for a quick treat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in the mall. Michael is super friendly and the food is really good. Will always to recommend to people when they are asking where to eat when shopping in the mall. Chicken Poppers are my favorite item to purchase."}
{"text":"I crave the BBQ flavor all of the time. So yummy! They let you sample all of the flavors and you also get to choose the type of potato (chips, curly fries, etc.) Awesome idea in the shopping malls for a small snack. Wish there were some with easier access."}
{"text":"Exactly how it was back home in the Philippines. For all the fobs out there like me, Potato Corner is one of those that reminds you of your growing up days. Every flavor I've tried is so good. My favorite is Cheese! And I always ask for extra. Everyone is really nice and friendly.   Dangerously located near the workplace!!!!"}
{"text":"Carb-O-Holic... I've been eyeballing this kiosk for quite some and finally gave it because it smelled like heaven. I ordered a small garlic Parmesan regular fry for $3 and it was more than enough (I didn't even finish it). This joint is pretty tasty but I must admit the cashier Alyssa touching her nose ring and playing with her hair every few seconds was a bit disturbing. I'm sure I wouldn't try it again but it was definitely worth the experience!   Xoxo,"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Fast service.  Tried the chicken tenders for the first time.  It was great!  The fries are always fantastic.  And it's so convenient to get to"}
{"text":"I ordered the $3.99 combo and it was enough to fill me up. I selected the curly fries with cheddar powder and the flavor was kind of intense, but in a good way. The fries were cooked well, but they could've eased up on the powder a little bit. The service was less than stellar. It took them a while to get my order out and were kind of slow in the back, but overall not a bad place."}
{"text":"This is a go to for my lunches. They have great corn and awesome fries. Sometimes their line can be a little long, but thy have a seating area near by you can wait. If you're looking to eat in doors this is not the place for you, however it's perfect for the park near by."}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: 4 - cute little food stand where it is annoying to have a long line. it's not their fault that there's no where to sit though!   SERVICE: 3 - they are pretty new in the mall, but it was a pretty long wait for fries. they need a more efficient way to have fresh fries and eliminate the long lines&wait.   FOOD: 5 - meal was expensive! me and my friend shared the biggest one for $8, but you get a pretty good amount of fries and you can even pick two flavors.   p.s. they give you your drink with the rest of the order"}
{"text":"Looks like Mara beat me to it, but agreed, these fries are awesome. A huge fry guy myself, I first tried these guys @ the 2014 foodies event, and fell in love. A huge variety of flavors, and always served with fresh fries. Located in the meadows mall, its convenient enough for me to drive and have that fries craving quenched. A must try when by. Sorry Mcdonalds fries, we're going to have to break up."}
{"text":"Food is good service sucks. Super slow! Not good for people who work here and have times breaks. I wish they would pick up speed. 15 mins for French fries is out of control. Get it together!!!! So I can enjoy your food."}
{"text":"I think this place has amazing fries but it still needs improvement, like they need to speed it up. It took us about maybe 30min. To just get the chicken combo with only 4 small loofy wings and a couple of loopy fries. Plus i think they need to size up the food portions. Plus, the girl who worked at the register said it would only be 7minutes for the chicken combo! I honestly think this place is horrible and the service is honestly disgraceful.  ;(  Also employees needs to work together and apologize to customers for the long unacceptable wait for a freaken fries and chix wings. Like seriously?"}
{"text":"I'm not much for fries and all .... but for some reason I love this place..... mmmmm BBQ flavored fries. Yes! That's my cake right there. I heard the chicken wings are excellent. I don't eat meat. But when my friends and I come here on Wednesday ( they have 5 dollar dozen wings on Wednesday's ) they always get it ( photo below) . I like be my fries with their mustard sauce. And the best part is that the fries are not greasy at all. Yum!  It's conveniently located at the galleria mall so after chow you can walk it off. Staff is friendly and the owner is hands on to make sure that orders are done right. I recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I've missed you Potato Corner.  We used to have one of you at Tanforan mall, but now no more.  Luckily I hit you up in Vegas.  Giga Size, Sour Cream & Onion, Curly Fries.  AWWWWWW YEAHhhhhhhhh."}
{"text":"This place brings me back to the time when I was 4 years old, in kindergarten wearing my Catholic school uniform back in Manila. Instead of walking 5 minutes to get home after school, I'd go to the school cafeteria and munch on some French fries until my school bus and nanny picks me up. Back then, flavors were limited: sour cream and onion, cheddar or BBQ...and you can only get French fries in either small or large.  A few years later, they opened up stalls in malls in L.A. and now, they made their way to Vegas and I couldn't be happier. This one is located inside Meadows Mall, in front of the Disney Store.  They have original French fries, loopy fries, sweet potato fries, tater tots, chips, chili cheese fries and baked potato. Flavors include cheddar, BBQ, sour cream and onion, chili BBQ, cinnamon and sugar, and garlic parmesan. Three sizes: jumbo, mega and giga. Drinks: soda, water, lemonade, strawberry lemonade and iced tea. So many choices now, it's crazy!  I normally get cheddar fries - original or loopy. That was my childhood favorite and still remains my favorite. I tried the garlic parmesan original fries and they were pretty good. A lot of people might find this salty but hey, that's what drinks are for!"}
{"text":"this location is way better than the townsquare location.   Friendly staff. And fast service."}
{"text":"This place is reinventing fries as we know them! Always fresh, hot and tasty, this new food kiosk at Town Square has the best fried spuds, no matter how you eat them-- as fries, tater tots, or curly.   Why 4 stars? It's a bit ironic, but the same reason these fries are awesome (fried fresh every time), makes the service a bit slow. Make sure to allow for a good 5-10 minutes to get your order.   My favorite flavor? Try the garlic parmesan! They are truly the best!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick snack during an event at Town Square and fries sounded good. Prices are a bit high for what you get but the fries were decent, we got the skinny; run of the mill fry with no seasoning, we got a couple dipping sauces to try. The fries were crisp and hot, but they were frozen fries, not fresh. The staff was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Really great customer service Ivory very joyful and happy to be at work. Stood out among the three employees even asked how my day was. He recommended the SC&O jiga curly fries. BOMB! I'll be back for sure thank you"}
{"text":"I remember eating these fries when I visited the Philippines. I'm so happy they finally opened a couple in Las Vegas.   Never disappointed here. The cheddar fries are my favorite."}
{"text":"No doubt this is one of the best places for fries alone. Going to Galleria or Townsquare, this is what I looked forward too. It does take some time, but honestly it's all worth it! BBQ Fries all the way!"}
{"text":"cute little place. loved it. my boyfriend and i order a mega tots with chilli cheese and bacon."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Always cooked fresh. Best flavors are BBQ!! Staff is always friendly and helps with smile. On the weekends the line can get pretty long ......love the food .....I'll wait!"}
{"text":"When im in the mood for fries i always come here!  The types of seasonings that go with the fries are from another planet.  They also have great chicken tenders! Must go!!  View More Reviews"}
{"text":"Just ordered the kids chicken tender box with CHEDDAR spice curly fries. Hot,fresh and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place was here! Been craving for this for a while now! I originally have known about this place from when I was living in the Philippines. So happy it's here!   So, I Took a lunch break and decided to go to this joint. I ordered the chicken wings combo, upgraded to the giga size fries with half sour cream and onion and half bbq. It is the BOMB. Cravings satisfied."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for them to open up a Potato Corner in Vegas & they finally did! This little food stand is native to the Philippines and every time I visit the mother land, this is a place that I MUST go. Now that it's here in Vegas, I can just hop in my car and drive to Meadows Mall instead of flying in an airplane to the Philippines.   Anyway, this place is definitely a MUST TRY for French fry lovers because you can season your fries with garlic Parmesan, cheese, BBQ, or even sour cream & onion! They even have chicken tenders, sweet potato fries, \"loopy\" fries, and baked potato!   The service is great and they're super nice! Not to mention their fries are pretty bomb diggity! Don't know about the baked potato or the chicken tenders yet since I haven't tried em but the fries.. Man, mmm mmm good!!!   So next time you shop at Meadows, don't forget to stop by here! They're located in front of the Disney Store and behind Coffee Bean :)"}
{"text":"shit took hella long bruh.. like dummy long fam! One girl workin but aye there ain't no excuses in life, yah feel"}
{"text":"Don't bother if you have an allergy or trying to get any product information. The \"store manager\" Jeanne was extremely rude and I witnessed her yell at one of her employees in front of me. I asked a simple question and she threw her \"title\" at me and said she should know everything. I just feel bad for the people that have to work with her.   Food quality is mediocre. Basic fries and they'll overcharge you for everything.   Would not recommend.   And Jeanne, I HIGHLY recommend an attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Since discovering they're here this year I've pretty much got an order of original fries every. single. time. I love them.   My favorite flavor is the BBQ and if you like spicy, get the chili BBQ version. Yums.   Sign up for their mobile thing (Fivestars program) and get a point for each visit. 10 visits and you get a free order of mega original fries. And since those are the only fries I get, it's perfect for me. Speaking of, my next visit is my free one ;).   First discovered them at a foodie fest in town and have loved them ever since."}
{"text":"I came at 8:43 and i understand that they close at 9 but it usually doesn't take longer than 10 minutes when i have visited before. So I start to order 2 larges and she tells me that they have a very large order in front of me and it will be 20 minutes. I walked away because i could tell that was a lie, then my boyfriend ordered and she told a similar story but now it was 25 minutes. We waited maybe 10 minutes.  We ate outside and watched them close up with no other orders were given out. That is so shady and i will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love these things! but then again, I LOVE fries! So I literally could eat fries for the rest of my life. Anyways, this is always a must stop place for me whenever I go to Vegas. I've tried the flavored tater tots and fries. We usually share a Giga size among my friends that could well feed all of us for a snack. I like all the different flavors but bbq would probably be my favorite. It is made to order so it takes awhile to cook up but it's worth it. Worth every single calorie and price it cost. But you can just walk around the mall to burn that off. :)"}
