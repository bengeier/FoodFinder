{"text":"On the Kosher restaurant scale, this one is a winner. Good service and  excellent food- both together are something of a rarity in the kosher world. More than a few times I have gone to a Kosher restaurant and received slow or rude service, mostly because it's a captive audience and the sentiment seems be 'Hey, where else you Jews gonna get a steak, huh?'   The service at El Morocco was great, and the food was awesome. As my wife said 'Usually at a Kosher restaurant, one thing is good and most of it isn't. But at El Morocco, everything was good.' I had kefta, mergez sausage and kabob, and each was delicious, and a totally unique food you don't get elsewhere, let alone kosher. The decor is lacking, but in the grand scheme, that ain't no thing."}
{"text":"Just to let you know - Restaurant El Morocco no longer exists. They sold the restaurant, making it no longer Kosher, and eventually it closed it doors.  (It's too bad, since there are no longer Kosher restaurants downtown)"}
{"text":"I definitely wanted north african food when I last visited Montreal. This restaurant is situated strangely at the base of a high rise condo. The waitress was so pleasant and was at our beck and call since we were the only ones there. I had the meat pastry appetizer which was delicious. Like an egg roll wrapped in filo dough. It was a cinnamony/almondy/meaty spring roll, if you will. And the lamb tagine was succulent, I just had to pull the meat off the bone with my fork. And the cous cous was fluffy and perfect. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water.  I have to say, though, that the 2 $$ sign rating is a tad misleading. It should be $$$. I think that $35 for a lamb tagine (though delicious) should be rated with 3 $$$."}
