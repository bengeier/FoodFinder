{"text":"A great dive bar.  They couldn't make me a manhattan because they didn't have any vermouth, that confirmed their dive bar status for me.  5stars."}
{"text":"Top notch dive!  Cheap, stiff drinks, good jukebox, and all the bar games you need.  Best part is the patron/employee whom I know as Cory.  Serves and drinks up solid mixers and interesting shots. Recommended joint. Ask for El Hefe if you visit."}
{"text":"The only place in town that knows how to pour a strong cheap drink. Weekends are always busy and the atmosphere is welcoming. I love this place"}
{"text":"Really like this place, wound up there one night by accident, as my friend  and I got disgusted with the lousy service at the \"other\" bar in the same shopping center as Tony's.
The place had a good vibe, jukebox playing, people shooting darts,  we felt totally comfortable, and found a table, to sit and catch up.
 Service was really good, The bartender, while waiting on another customer, made eye contact, to acknowledge me, and said she'd be right with me.  I like that in a place, ---nothing worse than standing at a bar waiting to order drinks and feeling invisiable.

My beer was good and cold,  my friend ordered a vodka and orange juice, and commented that it was a nice \"stiff drink\" -  

We both said we were glad we stumbled upon Tony's and will be back."}
{"text":"Can I give no stars please?!?! Went in there and had My boyfriend ask for a water- bartender refused to serve us because we had been drinking already. Aren't they obligated to do that? What a joke. F the Yelp reviews. Service is what's worth talking about, and Tonys Definitely does not deliver.
BoooOooOoOoo!"}
{"text":"Great bar. Friendly staff and amazing prices. Wish they served food other wise perfect place to hang out at and play all the bar games you can think."}
{"text":"It's terrible. Bartenders and staff are rude and unprofessional. I wouldn't go in here again if you put a gun to my face."}
{"text":"It's really hard to judge a bar when you go there on a weekday.  I am a fan of dives and this one was ok. The beer was cheep and they serve tall  PBRs which is awesome. The pool tables were all open. The people there seemed to be an oler crowd. 30 and up. The girl bartender was cool.  The worst part was there was really nothing to look at.  :( Also the music they played on the jukebox sucked. There was A LOT of country followed by rap, Beastie Boys, a little classic rock... it was kinda WTF."}
{"text":"I love this bar. Total gem. Unpretentious, affordable, great neighborhood bar. You can chat with the friendly clientele, or keep to yourself. They have pool, shuffleboard, and darts. Definitely my favorite spot on the NW side right now."}
{"text":"Never heard of a bar charging you a buck everytime you use your credit card, but good ole' Tony has that bright idea. If your only going to Tony's once in your life, like myself, then his policy does not mean alot. Inside, you got your un-Scottsdale crowd, mostly normal working class and a few bikers tossed in for the heck of things. Plenty of old TV sets and quite crowded on a recent Saturday night, but a few shots and a few beers later and everybody at Tony's is way happier."}
{"text":"They have not only pool but shuffleboard and darts! My friend and I had a blast, we literally played everything. And the drinks were reasonably priced! I feel like it's difficult to find bars with darts, but shuffleboard is even harder to find! And the bartender was super sweet. :) No complaints, the only dive bar I have thoroughly enjoyed. We came on a Monday night for context, so that's probably what you want to do if you want all the games to yourself haha."}
{"text":"First things first...DOUBLE my stars. This place gets a 10/10. I go there very often, it's close to my house, and I know people that go there often as well. The drinks are great, the price is great. They have multiple pool tables and dart boards, even a shuffle board! As for the staff and bartenders...I love them like a fat kid loves cake. Everyone gets along with everyone. It gets busy on the weekends, the touch tunes jukebox has a lot of songs to choose from. I highly recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"This bar is one of the coolest places on the planet.  I'm \"not from around here\"... and I'll stop there.. on occasion I have felt like a stranger in a strange land, but maybe that was Yuma... I digress... 

Anyway, to be frank, I came in there after checking out a local community college down the street... where I IMMEDIATELY realized I was in the wrong place. Young ladies that were probably from Brooklyn that were problee at least 9xs smarter than me... with awesome whips, er, cars... I vacated he premises stage left but found Tony's. While they do not serve food, allegedly, they had my favorite snack and pretzels to boot. 
Only one negative.. I was a bit intimidated at first, but that was because I got schooled in pool, but worse, felt like a runt. I'm like 5'10.5 and I was probably shortest one there! Oh well. Top notch staff and patrons were very cordial, even though I came in just a tad sideways... not narcotics or EtOh.. worse.. sleep deprivation. They may have saved me by letting my linger til close.   Thanks Tony's! : ) only other problem: lost my wallet, but totally my faults.  Please visit if you dig darts and billiards and sweet bartenders. Trident in Tucson is the only one that might top it friendly wise:"}
{"text":"They wouldn't serve me a Pina Colada. Then they wouldn't serve me a White Zinfandel. Then they wouldn't serve me a Mudslide. 

Turns out, I'm a douche. This bar is fucking amazing. They poured me a scotch on the rocks and told me to shut the fuck up. Once I listened, things got rockin. 

The bartenders stared at me a little too much, but I'm used to that. I resemble a young Henry Winkler. And I have the leather jacket to match.

All in all, it was a wonderful time. Five Stars. Five Bazillion Stars. Bring your mother. And tell her I says Hello."}
{"text":"Such a quaint little hole in the wall bar in Glendale! They have shuffleboard, pool and darts. They also have TouchTunes available which connects to an app on your phone and is like a juke box. Great selection of beers on draught and only $2."}
{"text":"One of the classier dives in Glendale, if I had known about this place sooner I would probably be here every night. It's only 2 miles from where I live. 
OK, maybe not every night, but $6 for a pitcher of Amber Bock? That's a good enough deal to get drunk on! Just don't eat anything before you go and you're really set! 
The funny thing about this bar is the diversity of music they play vs. the stereotype of clients they pull in. I heard a few classic rock songs that wanted to make me wave my confederate flag (and really perked up the clientele), then i got a dose of the Beastie Boys and Offspring which made me feel like I was in high school, but I could legally drink and then there was some rap and Britney Spears thrown in. 

They have games on TV and plenty of pool tables. It's actually a pretty clean place. I would take my mom here."}
{"text":"A favorite of Thunderbird students for generations, Tony's is Glendale's greatest dive. Cheep beer, shuffleboard, pool tables, darts...What more could you ask for on 59th and Greenway?"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place two stars is because they have a shuffle board and it was surprisingly fun...but they made up this rule that if your from out of town they have to write down all your license info saying it's a state law...I never heard of this and asked a couple of bars and they haven't either...I don't like giving my info out like that"}
{"text":"TOTAL DIVE. I love it. Everyone for the most part is pretty friendly. You will definitely find anyone who went to Greenway High School here. POOL. DARTS. but mostly the bartenders are NICE, YOUNG and GOOD looking. not always the case in a crappy dive. DEF recommend."}
{"text":"This place has everything you require in a dive bar - jukebox, cigarette machine, very dark atmosphere, shuffle board, pool tables, cheap drinks, laid back crowd."}
{"text":"Tony's is the bar the northwest valley needs right now, and the bar it deserves. $2 Sierra Nevada IPA? $3 Stella? Is this real life? 

Lots of pool tables, darts, some arcade games, and ample seating. Also the youngest crowd I've seen in any watering hole lining 59th avenue. And like yours truly, they're into the day drinking! My only regret is not discovering this place sooner."}
{"text":"In an effort to expand my horizons locally, I ventured to the other side of the 17 to sample the local drinking establishments. Tony's is my kind of place. It's definitely a LOCAL bar -there are plenty of pool tables, the drinks are cheap so you really can't ask for more, can you?

I would rate categorize it as \"Dive Plus\"-it is definitely a neighborhood bar in a strip mall with a friendly, working-class local crowd who all know each other.  It is VERY nicely maintained and is just a good place to hang out and knock back a few. I visited on a work night so I had to behave but this is the type of place I would stumble out of at 2:05am on weekends.

Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great dive bar! I'm always surprised at how cheap my tab is...never fails!"}
{"text":"Tony's is the best thing ever put on this earth. I love it soooo much I want to MARRY it. I just might have to go again tonight ;-)"}
{"text":"Best bar around! (in my opinion.) In the same plaza as Kimmy's, but goiing to Kimmy's is not worth the walk! The bartenders there are always great! (except when they use the stand in one) But the normal crew is awesome. Cheap drinks, and yes....there is PBR."}
{"text":"More or less a cookie cutter bar.  Not that it is a bad thing, but looks like a dozen others I have been to in the valley.  I go there once in a while, like once or twice a year.  Very much a blue collar, divey, sometimes redneckish bar where for every girl there is probably a dozen guys.  They typically pour with a heavy hand, as long as you are cool to them, and remember to tip.  I go there when I want to get wasted, or just to relax."}
{"text":"I have given this dive bar five stars because of the amazing alcohol prices.  We had 64 ounce pitchers of Goose Island IPA for $8.50.  The atmosphere was dark with pool tables and dart boards, everything you would expect from a dive bar.  The music was a nice eclectic mix and not too loud.  An excellent dive bar."}
{"text":"Tonys never fails. Affordable, great enviorment, and wide range of music on the jukebox always! Service is excellent. I saw a review on here by a Hannah U. Who was upset because they were refused service because they were too intoxicated. Duh? If you're new to the area, or want a chill place to have a barley pop, I recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"This small bar I have been to in the past or when my main bar of choice is having a dart league. It's a small 2 section bar. The main section is the large bar it's self and the second section to the right is the couple of pool tables and dartboards. There are a few tvs throughout the place.

The place is not bad going to, but beware there is usually only 1 bartender and in order to get a drink you will have to go up to the bar.

This place is exactly like Marino's set up at 67th and Peoria. I believe that they both have the same owners. The dartboards have more challenges at Marino's however."}
{"text":"We came in before the busy time, around 8:30 pm, the blonde bartender completely ignored us for a good 5 minutes while she wiped the counter in front of us.... The party with us that came in later with  it took them 15 minutes before getting any service and there was only 10 people at the bar that have all been served already not waiting. They claimed we needed to yell at them to get service . Later we went to get more drinks and the bartenders continued to talk amongst themselves a for 8 minutes before helping anyone. At this point when I asked for my order they rolled their eyes and it took almost 3 minutes before getting it and my tab and there was no one else asking for drinks at the time. Bartenders were not attentive nor accommodating for any parties."}
{"text":"Agree with all the previous posters, great drinks, great prices, friendly staff.... Nice pool tables, dart boards, but they are soft tip and that makes me a little sad...lol

I drank several Guinness, and my friend drank at least a bottle of vodka and our bill was $23.00.  I got no complaints at all."}
{"text":"Was at the bar for over 3 hours and could only manage to get 3 beers. Had to raise my voice and wave to get the bartenders attention. It was pretty busy but I watched her talk to a friend for a few minutes and mess around on her phone a couple times. Seemed like she made a point to relax a little in between customers. Also after asking to close out my tab 45 minutes went by of me sitting there with an empty glass. When I asked again she said \"Yeah I know it's just busy\" and I had to say \"I understand but it's been 45 minutes since I asked you and I need to leave\". She then rolled her eyes and went and got my card and bill. Other than the service it seemed like a pretty cool place. Maybe they're just used to it being slow and laid back. Definitely won't be going back though."}
{"text":"Seriously the best dive bar in the west valley, day or night. Great bartenders working every shift and always serve tasty drinks for super cheap. Surprising amount of beers on tap and wide variety of liquor for mixed drinks and cocktails. They have Darts, pool, shuffle board and a modern juke box to entertain yourself and your friends. It's not small in size but has a cozy \"everyone knows your name\" feel. Voted best dive bar in the west valley in 2013 for a reason. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place makes the best drinks in town.  The service is excellent and the bartenders are the best.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tony's is a pretty standard dive bar. I prefer it to the other places near my apartment because it is more chill and serves Amber Bock in addition to the standard Budweiser/Coors/etc. This particular bar is surrounded by a Dairy Queen and a late night pizza place across the street---both are great after drinks. I only wish the clientele was a little younger."}
{"text":"My favorite place to hang out with friends,  terrific people and the four lovely bartenders that work there.  Great drinks at a great price.  Take that Scottsdale."}
