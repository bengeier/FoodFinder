{"text":"The habachi is way to expensive for the portion that they serve.  For hibachi steak & shrimp they charge 18.00, which is more then the prices on other hibachi places and they cook infront of you.  For 18.00 the portions were really small.  Usually I'm not able to eat the whole meal in other hibachi restaurants but in Yama, I ate the whole meal (besides the soup, didn't like it) and was still a little hungry.  Place is nice. Food was okay, portions were horrible.  I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant.  Excellent sushi.  By far one of the best. Just as good as nikko on south street.  Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"After visiting Nakato's and Edomae last week we stopped here on the way back home. We cant speak for the food but once again our sushi experiance was excellent. Four rolls were ordered and again very satisfied. The Dynamite roll is recomended by us and should be tried. We're a fan of this place for the area for sushi. Buy one get the second 1/2 price wednesdays and sundays...."}
{"text":"It was my first time there. I had their fried rice, and it was okay. They put too much butter on their rice. The sushi was good, but not best."}
{"text":"Not so good. The futomaki tasted like grass. The sushi rice was cold (supposed to be room temperature) and was also unseasoned, eel was also cold and not toasted. Either they are inexperienced or just don't care. 2nd try at this place. I give up."}
{"text":"Yama is a little sushi place in the midst of a sea of chain restaurants near the Lowes Speedway and Concord Mills, and it is definitely worth a visit.  The sushi quality was excellent;  everything was fresh and of high quality.  We also ordered a \"teppan yaki\" dish which was excellent as well, but came from the kitchen (not prepared at the table).  The staff was great, service was prompt and very friendly.  The restaurant was spotless and the decor was new and tasteful.  A great choice!"}
{"text":"If you want to have better good, Charlotte definitely has better options. The service was decent, my utensils were dirty which made me question if I should've left at the moment, but I still gave it a chance. I ordered the philly roll and another of their \"special\" rolls and they were decent to the point my girl and I didn't really wanna finish. Overall I felt like I should've left once I saw my dirty utensils. The staff also seemed friendly including a waiter playing with his daughter, which seemed very unprofessional, I don't know if it's because I went at a later time near closing time, but definitely not acceptable."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the sushi. The volcano roll is great if you like crunchy sushi. The hunters vile is delicious too. Fair prices. Average atmosphere. I'd recommend if you're looking for a comfortable place to enjoy good sushi."}
{"text":"I'm unfortunately giving this place a 1 star. Not because our waitress was horrible she was very good for only being her 2nd day or the food wasnasty because had it been served on time and all together I think the food could have been way better. I'm writing this review because of the way the manager handled the situation. The food came out in 45 minute increments, there was a frozen fly in an ice cube, a hair in someone's food, and an order was completely wrong. When spoke to tell manager about this evening he immediately went to blame everyone. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Best in concord area. Super fresh and great service You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Great service and food.  We were surprised to learn Sunday offered half off 2nd rolls.  We also had pho beware huge portions.  The crab Rangoon was best we've ever had.  Beer and wine also on special on Sunday's.  we will be back!"}
{"text":"Sushi was great but not very happy with their Grill food the rice is always mushy...But for the most part they have a good sushi selection."}
{"text":"Food delicious. Sushi selection primarily shrimp and tuna variations.  Only bad thing is restaurant is poorly lit in the evening.   I will be returning for lunch soon."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant was the customer service! My sushi roll was falling apart, the rice to fish ratio was way off (too much rice.) and no flavor. Very disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Yama is located within the array of attractions in Concord; from the mall to the speedway. It is easy to overlook as it is often overshadowed by major chain restaurants.  I have been to the restaurant a few times for lunch and have had their sushi and hibachi. The hibachi is average. I've had better. Additionally, don't expect the excitement of having your food cooked in front of you, as I don't believe they have table-side grills. However, the restaurant is clean and inviting.  The sushi is good.. average. I don't know that I would come here without the company of my coworkers, as they seem to really enjoy it."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place around. I have gone to many and this is the only one that that has consistently good customer service and food. I have been here many times now. Their sushi is the best and their plates are great as well. They don't have a lot of employees but their food comes fast and they are hospitable."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times.  We really love the sushi, but the service seems to get worse every time.  This last time, we waited for 30 minutes after we finished just to get the check.  I asked for it three times and after the third time the waiter just never came back.  We finally walked to the hostess station to pay.  I will definitely get take out, but will no longer dine in."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place.  Good for Kids and Good for Groups.  If you aren't sure what to get in the way of Sushi, just ask!  They will help you decide and if it isn't on the menu, the Sushi Chef will make you anything you want!!!!!  Go on in and enjoy REAL sushi"}
{"text":"There is entirely Too much rice used in their sushi rolls! Suggestion; more fish, less rice.  Pho: their pho broth is phenomenal, but they give a small portion of the rice noodles. Also, you can tell that their tendon sits in the fridge as it tastes like it has freezer burn. I would recommend the Pho over the the pho served at Pho Real! But they need to provide better portions and provide \"prepared the same day\" meets for the Pho."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! The service is so quick and everything taste amazing. I usually get their house salad with their amazing ginger dressing, for my sushi selection it's the Tornado, with a shrimp fried rice & the customer service is 5 star."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! Our dinner started out great - the waitress was very attentive in getting our drink orders and appetizers. I started going down hill when the appetizers cane. First of all the gyoza was cold in the center when it was supposed to be pan fried. We let that go. Then 3 people in our party received their food. The rest of us who had sushi were told ours would be out shortly. Not a problem. The problem arose when 20 minutes later our sushi still wasn't out. Mind you, our waitress didn't come by ONCE to give us an update. I finally got up and had to ask another waitress if our sushi was ready. She promptly brought it over as it was sitting there ready for who knows how long. The (random) waitress said the manager would comp us 20% on our bill for the inconvenience. When our bill came we only had 5% off our food only! Not off of the total bill. When we approached him to ask he was very rude about it.   Needless to say, we will certainly not be returning. The entrees were extremely bland... the chicken fried rice didn't even come with vegetables. For a party of 5, not one of us liked our dish."}
{"text":"This place for some reason doesn't have the best reviews. I can honestly say the food has always been great and no complaints. Obviously like most hibachi it is $$$. However, the portion size is filling with take home. I normally order the steak & shrimp and it is $18.95- pretty standard. The shrimp sauce is on point but I will say the homemade ranch for the salad is not ( get ginger).  My go to place since I moved to the area. No wait and I in and out with a full belly :)  Must try!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here this evening... Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and our food was prepared well. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is close to Concord Mills, but across the street. A little difficult to get to, but I finally found it. The secret is go straight through the light at Burger King and turn left right in front of Mayflower.   I went there at lunchtime... only one other couple there on Wednesday, right at 11:30 AM opening. I ordered sushi (Cherry lunch combo: 3 rolls and miso soup). The sushi was excellent in taste and presentation! My reason for 4 stars... they scrimped a little on the ginger and wasabi (I ran out) and the soup was only broth with 2 hunks of tofu and a bit salty for me.  The staff was very friendly, came by to check on me and refilled my drink several times. There were making a real effort to get us fed and out of there fast. The sushi chef listened as I was giving the order (my table was very close to him) and he started making my order while the waiter was still entering the order into their computer. He watched intently as I tasted everything too... I gave him a nod of approval when I had sampled. He smile and seemed to enjoy the approval. The waiter walked by each table and checked several times to see if everything was ok.   He asked if I wanted my tea refilled two times also. The manager/owner made sure my check was delivered and picked up promptly, when I was finished. A+ for team work and service today.  My bill was $14, I thought quite reasonable for lunch. I will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Good sushi at reasonable prices with a friendly staff. I haven't tried anything but their sushi but my favorite is the Volcano roll. I haven't had a bad roll yet. I recommend coming on one of their buy one get one half off days (Wednesdays and I think Sundays also) so you can try more rolls. Otherwise it could get a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Food was very good and the setting was very nice. Rather expensive for what you get. Suprisingly small portions...    Sorry, three stars. Give more for the money and this place could easily be 5 stars.  We will try again and post results in the future."}
{"text":"I came in here for lunch the other day. I will start off by saying the service was excellent and my waitress was more than attentive. I have absolutely no complaints with the service or the atmosphere.  It was very empty with only one other table inside. I ended up getting the sashimi platter as well as a ginger salad and miso soup. The sashimi was VERY disappointing. The fish was not very good quality and it was room temperature. It was difficult to swallow without gagging. I genuinely could not eat the last 4 pieces and had to throw them out. The salad and miso were what I expected. 2 stars because of the sashimi."}
{"text":"It was ok. Not sure if I'll go back or not. My lunch came with a California roll, two pieces of shrimp tempura and hibachi steak. My husband had the hibachi steak. It was not what I would consider real hibachi.  It was steak with some broccoli next to a scoop of rice and some over-cook carrots.  $22 for lunch. When I pay $22 for lunch I want to be wowed. The service was great though."}
{"text":"Meh. Every time I go to a new town, I search out nearby sushi. I tried this place and it was meh. As soon as I saw that the rolls were rolled in greenish seaweed, I knew it wouldn't be great. I got a lunch combo with Miso soup, that never arrived ( I think the server was new. She was nice but nervous) and as I'm writing this, this is when I realize I never got my miso..I digress. I got the spicey tuna, which wasn't spicey. The California roll which was actually pretty good and the Philly roll which was eh. Seaweed was chewy. Even though I got all of this for the price of $12, I wouldn't go back. My advice is drive the extra miles to another place..in fact I saw something about a conveyor belt sushi bar about 12miles from here!"}
{"text":"Very good pho. Rolls had a little too much rice but that is my only negative review from this visit.   Come on... good sushi with pho? Who can say no to that! Heaven!!!   I will defiantly come back here again.  Ps. Came back for the second time. Outstanding service and food but a little too much rice comes with the rolls and I had to pick them out."}
{"text":"The sushi here was great!! I went on a Wednesday so it was but one get one half off rolls. The Big Ben is huge and the Huntsville is good too. Let me say too the drinks were good. Long Island was a Long Island not just juice... Lol Check this place out."}
{"text":"Terrible, ordered appetizer and the dumplings  were soggy. Tried one, it was nasty. Told them they were to nasty. They told me no return  since I ate  one, i would have to pay for another order... after some words with management  they agree to fry what i ordered instead of taking them back and bring a new fresh order fried like i ordered.... terrible PR and blaming me is not professional. Food is ok, mainly sushi. But will go else where from now on"}
{"text":"My family has gone here for years since we live so close. We order the same thing every time so I recommend the Crab Pop (my all time favorite roll here) and the Seafood Fried Rice. We've tried most of the other rolls on the menu and I don't particularly love them. You know that feeling you get when you eat an AMAZING roll like your heart stops and you pause and you're like OH MAN. Well, you don't really get that feeling after eating some of these rolls. They're just average, you can probably find a similar tasting roll at an Asian buffet. The prices are up there for what it actually is.   You can ask to sit in their special seating area in the back, I would definitely try that if you get a chance."}
{"text":"We went for dinner here for the first time on Friday night.  This is a small restaurant,  but is decorated nicely.  The server was nice and attentive without over doing it.  When we arrived,  there were very few other diners,  but by the time we left the restaurant had filled up.  We shared 6 sushi rolls between 3 adults.  Some of the rolls we got were huge, making them difficult to eat,  but they were all good.  Of the sushi choices close to our house,  this is probably at the top of the list now."}
{"text":"Who would have thought a sushi restaurant would make such great tasting pho?  The first time I stopped by Yama Sushi & Grill, I was very skeptical about how good the pho would be and opted out of trying it. However, this time around, the owner had actually remembered me from my last visit (more than a month ago!) and instantly spoke to me in Vietnamese. Suddenly, it all made sense why this Japanese restaurant was serving arguably the most popular Vietnamese entree.   My coworker and I decided to split a bowl of pho that the chef kindly separated into two bowls for us. I also got an order of the sushi salad as well as the eel and cucumber rolls. Service was extremely accommodating with the waiters coming by to check on us very frequently. We were even given two fresh, hot towels before our meal.   I had envisioned the sushi salad to have lots of seaweed salad and cubed pieces of fish like salmon, tuna, and hamachi. Instead, it actually looked like a typical lettuce salad with a spicy mayo sauce that reminded me a lot of a thousand island. The fish pieces were a tad bit too large and sightly tough to eat while the seaweed salad was practically drowned out by the crab salad and lettuce. I did, however, enjoy the crab salad and the creaminess of it. The eel and cucumber roll was flavored well, allowing me to taste each component separately. While I do wish the sushi rice was softer, that familiar vinegary taste was delicious.  The main reason I increased my score was because of the pho. Surprising, right!? I was absolutely astonished by the broth, full of umami flavor without being too heavy. The noodles weren't soggy and the slices of thin meat were tender. There were even some pieces of tripe as well as juicy, beef meatballs. I was slightly bummed that I wasn't given any basil leaves, a must for pho, but it wasn't too big of a problem since the pho was quite delicious on its own.  It's really strange that a Japanese restaurant made pho so well, even better than the preparation of the actual sushi. This just goes to show that I shouldn't be so quick to judge. The last time I came by I said I was going to stick to the sushi at Yama Sushi & Grill, but I think I'm going to get myself a hot bowl of steaming pho instead. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls are really good. My favorites are the volcano, fire roll, and crab pop. They always have special rolls as well and those are pretty tasty. The hibachi is a good price for the portion, enough to eat twice. They recently starting serving pho! I'm so excited because there's not a vietnamese restaurant up this way and now this place has pho. It's authentic pho and you can tell the chef cooks the broth for more than 8 hours. It's some of the best especially during the cold days. The portion size is really big and pricing is reasonable due to the amount of meat you're given.   The restaurant is family owned and very friendly.   Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had. The raw fish was warm and tasted sour and the rolls were falling apart. We went in to pay and after charging our card the man working up front walked away without actually giving us any food and didn't come back out until another customer came in the door. Our sushi was sitting at the bar for 15 minutes before someone realized it was our food and brought it to us. We ended up throwing it away.  We will absolutely not be going back."}
{"text":"On 12/23, I dined here with family and I will not return. I chose this restaurant because of the reviews on yelp. However, the hibachi dinners were served cold, the teriyaki salmon was not fresh, and the food did not come out together.  The manager, Mimi, came to address the table and we explained the salmon dinner was not good and the food was not hot. Mimi informed us that what is \"good\" varies from person to person, and she could not comp the salmon dinner, but offer 20% off. I've never heard of a manager not comping a meal that was unsatisfactory.   I've never heard of a manager leaving their party upset, especially on a first-time dining experience.  Save your money and dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Understaffed. One waitress who is very short and rude with customers. I ordered a fillet hibachi with vegetables that was awesome. I ordered pho that came with suds in the bowl in the lady said it was from the onions. She then continued to laugh at me. When we asked her why she was laughing she said because we were insulting her. And When she brought me another bowl to show me how all of the bowls have suds that second bowl did not have any suds.  So unfortunately looks like they need to rinse the dishes a little more & mouth off a lot less."}
{"text":"Great sushi, tip sit at the sushi bar and chat up them up they will always hook you up with something a little extra.  The sushi is pretty good above average. I think hibachi meals are pretty large for their price.  Consider that you are in concord and that you are getting sushi this place is decent.  Way better than tsunami."}
{"text":"We love this place! The decor is lovely, the service is great, and the food is wonderful.  We usually start off with sushi. Mom gets the #88 roll, which has kani and cream cheese. She loves it! It's always high quality and fresh.  I usually order the dancing eel roll. The eel is always nice and hot, while the roll itself is cold and fresh - just the way it should be.  I often order hibachi steak. Unlike a previous reviewer, I find the portions perfectly satisfying. Even if I don't get a roll, I usually have food to take home. If I do get a roll, I take home almost all the hibachi. It's always hot and fresh, and the fried rice is delicious.  I didn't give five stars just because there are other (though more expensive) sushi places around, but I think Yama is the best sushi in Concord."}
{"text":"I ordered a few sushi rolls and Pho to go. They gave me an abundance of veggies and such for the pho, but the flavor of it wasn't my favorite, but still not bad! Sushi was great though!"}
{"text":"Okay. Too much dressing on salad.  The yellow tail roll was good.  The yellow tail sashimi sliced very thin"}
{"text":"Sushi is good- not great for the prices. I will definitely recommend to try the seafood fried rice!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for months. The sushi is subpar in my opinion, but when they started selling Pho I became a regular because it is very good there. I always order the same thing, vegetable Pho no mushrooms (which is usually delicious). Last night I ordered to-go about 15 minutes before closing time. I got home, made a bowl and was disgusted upon tasting it. It seemed maybe they were running low on broth since it was so close to closing and added water and oil to fill my to-go container. You could even see the oil separated in the container once it settled which I've never experienced with their broth before, something was obviously off. It was inedible, I threw the bowl I made away, called them and got no answer (which I figured since it was now past closing time at point)I was about to throw the remainder of it out until my roommate told me I should just return it.   The next day I did just that. The owner doubted me, it seemed as though she thought I was trying to get over on her (over just 10 freakin dollars) I searched \"Yama sushi\" in my bank app to show her the many times I've been there and the purchases of exactly $9.58 proving I always come there and order the same thing. I even showed her my call log to show I called last night and all she said was \"well I was here the time you called.\" Okay but you didn't answer so what's your point?? Anyways, she proceeded saying she couldn't give me a refund since it I ate some, I stated the bowl I did make for myself was in my trash and I threw it out after taking a couple bites because of the taste. She said I'd have to get it in order to get at refund... real ridiculous to make a customer go home and go through their garbage, right? When I returned, I did get refund but her attitude was VERY poor. She stated how much Pho she sold yesterday and nobody complained and how she doesn't think she'll ever sell me Pho again. She didn't apologize once. Her customer service sucks, her attitude is poor and she's an ugly bitch. Needless to say I won't be back. I will now stick to Pho Real for my Pho."}
{"text":"Mimi Mimi.......this is the best sushi .  Thanks for the birthday present ... Great sushi....."}
{"text":"I came back to give it another shot since I love how they serve you a hot towel. It is rare to see that around restaurant. I was wanting to go all out on their nigiri sushi but a sad thing was they didn't have any toro (fatty tuna). It's understandable because it cost more and may not be in season but I also felt like they should have taken it off the menu or at least mention about it not being on the menu all the time. Overall, their teriyaki chicken was very good."}
{"text":"Decent food, cool ambiance/decor, great staff...the downfall of this place has to be the location. Hardly no one knows it's there and once you do spot it, it's kind of complicated to get to. The handful of times that I have been here it's practically empty:-(  I had my first sushi in NC here :-) it was \"okay\". Not the greatest I've ever had, but good enough that when I crave sushi again I would go back here.   The staff always makes an effort to make an impression with their courteousness. There is also a traditional Japanese dining rm featuring floor seating, no shoes allowed, etc. There is a fee to use the rm if less than 6 people in your party.  Once I remember that this place is here, I just might become a regular ;-)"}
{"text":"We are giving the food a 4. The white sands roll is yummy!! We would give our server Ashley a 5 if we could! She remembered us from our first visit and she offered so many different options: she remembered that my kiddos love the miso soup but just the broth and brought just the broth, she remembered my daughter loves California roll but not the seaweed so she offered rice paper instead. We would come back just for the service!!"}
{"text":"The Crab Sticks sushi was really good. Everything else we had was decent .I'm a sushi lover, and have had the best sushi in Hawaii. (So my standards are pretty high) Yama is a quiet place for dinner with the fam."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!!! Always delicious and the owner is very personable and cares about your needs!!!  I definitely recommend to anyone to eat here. The specialty rolls are too die for!!"}
{"text":"Usually on point with their sushi but don't bother with the tuna tataki for the market price. The Panther Roll is so very good! The hibachi steak is always a good cut and is delicious. Excellent customer service. Strong martinis!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. I give them 4 stars for the sushi and apps, and 1-2 stars for the entrees. The sushi is great for the price and tasted fresh. The entrees were mediocre at best. The chicken hibachi was boring and the steak tasted gamey and kind of weird. The miso soup was okay, the salad left a lot to be desired. Service was fine and the sushi is great. Just stay away from the actual entrees. And if your eye happens to catch the big \"buy one get one half off\" sign on your way in, be sure to also notice the much smaller print that says \"Sundays and Wednesdays only\". We probably should have caught that, but felt a little misled."}
{"text":"I like this place. Small restaurant with a bar (which is a plus, lol). Great lunch spot. The waitress helped and explained everything that I has question for. The food was yummy! I had the veggie pho soup my first have it. The flavor was really good. The tofu was lightly fried just wish is was a more. They had two TV's by each bar. We got our food fast"}
{"text":"I ordered carry out from here. The restauraut is nice. But honestly, I have had way better japanese before. I ordered the hibachi chicken. The soup was really gross! The chicken didn't have much of a flavor, and mushrooms seemed a bit undercooked. Definitely won't go back."}
{"text":"Best sushi by far you will ever eat. My husband and I are moving and had our last Wednesday night buy one get one 1/2 off on rolls. Been such a pleasure to have gotten to know the owners and staff here. Excellent people! Excellent service and always fresh and on top of new and delicious things. From Nigiri to Sashimi and all kinds of special rolls to the newer noodle bowls. Really something for everyone here. Warm, family atmosphere. About all I can say is you will never be disappointed! We were certainly never disappointed, hardest thing is to know that we will be to far away to keep going on any regular basis , but when NC calls you better believe this will be a definite stop on our way through town! Thank you all for your outstanding service , excellent food and making us feel so at home there. My husband travels the country and puts this place up against any he has been to anywhere ! Yes that's how good it is! If your by , you should definitely give them a try, you'll be hooked ! We leave with our warmest wishes for your continued success and putting out the best everyday! Oh and hats off to the sushi chef tonight for the new and delicious white tuna with the mint and the ponzu sauce, delicious! Always blowing the taste buds away!"}
{"text":"There were many things wrong with my experience and the food was meh.  I ordered some rolls and they are about $11 each.  The quality is sub par and they are thrown together hastily.  I would expect these to be in the $8 range for the size and quality.  One of my rolls didn't come out correctly and I asked about it.  I was told it was correct so I asked for menu.  I never go that menu but the waitress looked at it and told me one of my rolls didn't come with scallions, although she was correct that wasn't the roll I complained about.  She was really set on pointing that out.  Then the roll I was pointing to, well she admitted it had scallions.  She asked if I wanted a bowl of scallions or for them to make it again.  I asked for them to make it again.  She came back a few minutes later with a bowl of scallions.  We already has this conversation.  She asked if that was alright and I told her that I wanted them to make it again and that I had also already asked them to make it again, so now I am again asking them to make it again.  She did finally return with the roll made the way it appears on the menu.  The sushi rice was warm, unlike my food friend across the table, I don't like warm rice.  Regardless this didn't end better.  I had to wait for my check and then I had to chase down the waitress for my check.  We had a movie to see and didn't have time to wait another 10 minutes for her to return.  Our water glasses stayed empty after being filled because of lack of service.  I tried to rush the door and pay at the counter so I could wrap up this disappointment.  It took much longer than I wanted.  I did get a roll for almost free (I had to pay for the two original rolls and got almost a 100% discount on the remake of one of those two original rolls).  I thought the waitress wanted me to be grateful that I didn't have to pay for the remake, unfortunately I am not that charitable and expected that when you mess up food preparation, deny you did so, make the customer repeatedly point out the mistake and repeatedly demand the fix that I am not thankful after all that for getting what most restaurants deliver on the first try.  There is absolutely no reason to go here, and I have good reason to never go back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Japanese restaurant in town. The servers were amazing, they knew exactly what I wanted and helped me out extensively. Very attentive and catering."}
{"text":"Sushi was the best I had ever had! I had the crab pop and it was amazing!!! Kinda felt like we were bugging the staff with needing a larger table for accommodating my husband and I and our son in a high chair (we needed a table bigger than the 2 person table they first tried sitting us at). Then asking for a spoon for the soup and other things I felt we annoyed our server. The food was so good I will be back though!"}
{"text":"In the Concord Mills area, we decided we wanted to try some sushi. In retrospect, that may not be the best choice. Just being in that area lends itself to those looking for a quick meal, which may or may not meet certain quality standards, no matter where you go. There are places that stand out, but as always, it takes a certain effort to do so.  Here, that effort falls a bit short. Their menu is reasonable enough, and you do get the choice of items from the \"hibachi\" menu or from a sushi menu. But while waiting for the food to be delivered (and this can take a while), the service seems to forget you are there from time to time, and when it comes out, there is nothing particularly memorable. Also, even with the buy one get one half off deal that is offered, you may find that the bill is a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Horrible!! I'll  start off by saying I don't write reviews but, I downloaded this app just so I could inform anyone that may considering eat here not to. The restaurant was not busy or crowded at all w/less than a handful of customers. I ordered the hibachi chicken & my daughter ordered the soup when our food arrived the chicken was cold. I waited a while for the server to come back to our table but, she didn't. After I discreetly get her attention I informed her that the chicken was cold. She took my plate & walked away. A few minutes later she came back, put it in front on me & said she microwaved it. Not sure what they cook their food with but, my rice transformed into something w/the texture of oatmeal & the chicken was like chewing rubber. I couldn't eat after that as it was horrible to say the least."}
{"text":"While on vacation in Concord earlier this week, I was craving some sushi.  So I went searching on Yelp and based on the reviews and closeness to the mall, I opted for Yama.  It was a Wednesday and I didn't realize it was buy one roll, get one roll half off.  I ordered a total of four rolls and edamame for me and my ten year old and it was $20.17!  I was floored at the value as sushi at home in CT is about 10-15 per roll, depending on the fanciness/complexity of the roll.  So we headed back to my inlaws and I was so excited the whole way home to eat my sushi.  Once I got home and actually started eating the sushi, that's when reality kicked in.  It was good sushi, not great.  The value was the only great part.  To sum it up, for everyday boring sushi on a Wednesday or Sunday, then Yama is your place.  I definitely would not pay full price for any of those rolls on a different day.  Next time I am in Concord for a visit, I will spend a little more elsewhere and get something unique and memorable."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! I had the Volcano roll and Vegetable Fried Rice. My other half had the Huntersville Roll and the Fire Roll. It was all so good! The fried rice was the best I've ever had! We will definitely be back to try other things here"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom because she is always talking about how good the sushi is. I ordered the Volcano roll and Smokey Mountain roll and they were both delicious! The service was also wonderful. Overall it was a great experience :)"}
{"text":"I love this place and drive all the way from rock hill for their sushi. Service can be hit or miss unless you are lucky enough to get Skinny or the owner Kevin then it is spot on. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The potions have diminished ! Paid a lot for very little. Food was great but still felt ripped off!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently fantastic. My boyfriend and I go here every week, the sushi is always fresh and on point. Staff is always friendly and it's a great experience."}
{"text":"Great first dining experience! Went there at lunchtime... wasn't too busy. I ordered sushi (Cherry lunch combo) and my husband had the hibachi chicken. Both meals were excellent! The staff was very friendly, came by to check on us and refill our drinks several times. We will definitely go here instead of other local Japanese restaurants in the future."}
{"text":"This was really good sushi. I ordered to go and had great conversation with the waiter! He asked what I liked in my sushi and found the perfect roll for me. Although I said I didn't like spicy and my roll was a bit spicy. It wasn't too bad and it was the perfect sushi for me. I'm going back!"}
