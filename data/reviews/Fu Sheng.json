{"text":"Good food!  Moved from Chicago 4 months ago and we've been looking for good chinese food.  Ordered shrimp friend rice, honey walnut shrimp and combination egg foo young.  All of them were delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! Love the orange tofu! Great service. Happy to finally find a great Chinese place nearby"}
{"text":"Came here with my son , General Tso's chicken lunch special and pork lo mein, excellent service  going back today for take out"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Asian food place. Great prices, food was fantastic, service was very quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Went there with my brother last week.  I was concerned because it was empty.  What a surprise,  it was great!  We went back the next day.  They have fantastic BBQ pork fried rice also."}
{"text":"I always have good food at this place.  I especially love the spare rib tips."}
{"text":"The food here is very greasy, tastes alright but about what you would expect from Chinese takeout. The service is actually really great, ordering was easy, correct, and very fast.

Not bad but I probably won't go back. Went to wash my hands and saw that the bathrooms were pretty gross, out of paper towels, overflowing trash and a half flushed seat protector."}
{"text":"I waited over an hour for my food, the delivery guy did not come into my apartment but made me walk outside after calling me for a second time because i couldnt find him and then hung up on me. Then he was over my shoulder demanding a tip. I usually tip but if youre going to damand one, then no its not happening. Will not be ordering from here again just based on that.

Update: worst sesame chicken ive ever had."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this restaurant so I decided to try it.  Don't waste your time and money on this place.  I ordered shrimp fried rice and shrimp egg foo young.  The rice is a yellow rice with onion and a few bean sprouts.  That's it. I've made egg foo young at home and mine was better. It didn't have any taste and had a weird texture.  I don't know if it wasn't cooked enough because it was on the soft side.  I'm not sure if I should give it another try with another dish. I'll let my tummy guide me and see how I feel tomorrow."}
{"text":"Tonight was the second time my family ate here. I like to try restaurants twice before making a full decision and I have to say this place is great. The pan fried noodles are as close to the cake noodles   I grew up eating in Hawaii. The bbq noodle soup is tasty and the broth isn't salty. The portions are large. The service is great and the server even packed up our to go boxes. Our new go to Chinese food place."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and hot.  The service was very good.  And the prices very reasonable. We had the sweet and sour chicken, pork fried rice, and the hot and sour soup.  All of it was very good.  
The servers were very attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  We are definitely planning on coming back."}
{"text":"Good service. Friendly, attentive staff. But the dish, garlic chicken from the lunch specials, was bland. It resembled a tasteless, slightly spicy mush, drowned in a sauce. Ditto for the hot and sour soup and the egg rolls. I hoped for more in light of the praise."}
{"text":"I live on Power and McDowell so there's not many Asian places to eat. I was driving by and noticed they had finally opened Fu Sheng. Food is good I enjoyed it as did my girlfriend, only reason I'm not rating them 5/5 is because there service is lacking had to wait for a refill for my drink twice for 10+ minutes."}
{"text":"Normally I really enjoy this restaurant but tonight came by for a to-go order and there was a new guy behind the counter who was quite rude. I came to the counter to pay before the order was ready and he didn't say anything at first, just walked off to take a few orders at the tables. By then there was a lady waiting to check out behind me and he ignored me and took her check. I waited and once he was done, he still didn't do anything. I asked \"can I pay now?\" and he scolded me \"just wait a minute\". He then took the next couple that came up behind me. Once that was done, I said \"do I have to wait until the food is ready?\" He said yes and walked away. Later one of the regular staff that we usually see here rang me up (food still wasn't done). Usually we get great service here and I've recommended it to a lot of people, so this was highly disappointing."}
{"text":"We have eaten here every other week and it is just delicious! We have had the orange chicken, general tso's chicken and kung pao chicken. the hot and spicy soup is great. nice owners..check this place out!"}
{"text":"The family style meal was tasty and more food than we could eat.  Service was perfect. The food was excellent. Not busy as it is new but you should try this good family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE !!!! COCKROACHES!!! INFESTED!!! PLEASE LET THE WORD OUT!!!They served me fried Cockroache in my rice !!! This is disgusting I went in for the lunch special today 11/15/2017 ordered sweet and sour pork I got my plate took a bite of my pork then I saw the roach in my rice in my plate called the waitress once I was getting up I saw baby cockroach walking down the table I can not believe this is horrible will never eat this again !!!!thinking about it makes me throw up I had already eaten the egg drop soup they serve with the food !!! I've been nauseas since matter of fact throw up today !!! This is not acceptable !!! Will call Arizona department of health services!!! This is not sanitary !!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have driven by here a few times and finally stopped in, well we are so glad we did. The food is so good and tasted very fresh and came out quickly once we ordered.  The servers were all nice and attentive and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Did I go to the same restaurant as everyone else? Maybe it's better if you eat in?

I had a bizarre, but strong craving for tofu and hot and sour soup. I ordered the ma po tofu combo, hot and sour soup, and egg drop soup. (Sadly, since moving to Arizona I usually order both when trying a new place in hopes that at least one of them is good)

Ordering was easy and the staff was friendly and prompt. The restaurant is nice on the inside. I had high hopes.

When I got home, I realized that the weight of my soups had crushed the container of tofu and rice. Not the worst thing, but annoying... sauce all over the bag and the container was destroyed so I had to use a plate to eat out of. (First world problems to the extreme, I know. I hate myself a little bit for writing that, but there's got to be a better way for them to package to go orders) Also, the crunchy noodles for the soup were in an open bag which spilled all over on the way home and were soaked in sauce.

The food was not good! Someone else posted on here that the hot and sour soup was too spicy to eat, but again, I feel like I went to a completely different restaurant. My hot and sour soup was flavorless and the chicken in it tastes bad. The egg drop soup does the job though, so I'm happy about that. Their take on ma po tofu was tofu, sauce, and a bunch of peas and carrots. I know that Americanized chinese food means that there are no set rules about these dishes, but this was not what I expected at all. The fried stuff that comes with the combo was underwhelming, especially the crab rangoon which hardly had any filling.

Super disappointed. I hope that maybe I just caught them on an off night."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp.
We got it to go, as it was friday, I was knackered, kids were screaming for FOOD, you get the picture.

It was so good! While still somewhat \"Americanized\", it was not as oozing sweet syrup as some other places- in fact, I found their orange chick the best I've had in Az!

Their soups are the bomb, and come in HUGE containers!

My new Chinese place, fo sho."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to eat Chinese food and we wanted to try a new place so I looked on Yelp and found that Fu Sheng has opened recently and they had good reviews so we decided to try it. We arrived at around 8pm or slightly earlier and the first thing that caught my attention was how nice the interior decor is in comparison to the outside look of the restaurant! The outer look was more like a diner and it looked kinda old but the inside of the restaurant was nicely done we were please fly surprised. When we walked in, there were a couple of people waiting for a takeout order and there was only 1 occupied table. The restaurant is pretty big, again it looked much smaller on the outside. We were seated immediately and asked what we'd like to drink and were handed the menus. A few minutes later our waitress came back with our drinks and asked us if we were ready and we were so we ordered the meal for two. We selected the hot and sour soup & the egg drop soup. We also selected the fried shrimps for our appetizers and one crab cake. We also ordered the chicken Lo Mein, the sweet and sour chicken and the beef with Broccoli. (With this meal you get two soups, 2 appetizers each, 2 main dishes and one noodle or rice dish)
We were served the soup very quickly. My soup was a little too spicy for me I couldn't finish it even though it was very good. A few minutes later our appetizers which were 3 pieces of shrimp and 1 crab cake, so I guess by two appetizers they meant 2 pieces. The shrimps were nice and crunchy and my husband liked his crab cake. Just as we were finishing the appetizers, our mains were served. 
The food was delicious and the first thing you notice when you take your first few bites is that the food tastes clean! I saw a review saying that and I totally get it! Yes, it doesn't taste like your typical everyday take out Chinese food! 
When we were close to finishing our meal, our check was put on the table and there were people already cleaning the restaurant, something I thought was not entirely appropriate given that we felt rushed the whole time rather than feeling that the server was trying to be efficient! She was in a hurry to settle the bill and get us out the door even though it was only 8:30pm, no one else was in the restaurant and they close at 9:00pm!
Nevertheless, and despite the rushing part, this place I believe is a great find and we will be going there again for sure!"}
{"text":"Chinese take out. Yes it used to be my favorite meals. Lately I have not been indulging in this category, but I have not lost my touch in this field. I was drving around and I saw this place, and yes I was hungry. I ordered House Special Lomein. When I took the first bite, I said, yeah, this is it !!! I have been to so many takeout Chinese places. But this place, located in a busy plaza has the right taste and more. I wa impressed with its taste. And who would think a place like this will have food that will hit your spot right on? Try this place if you can. I would give 5 stars. But I tried only one dish. So until next time, it is four stars. I know one of these days I will be out and about, and all of a sudden, I will be hit with an uncontrollable urge for Chinese takeout, and I hope I am nearby. I shall be so driven by that unforgettable taste of Lomein with the right amount of soy sauce on it. This place has got it here. And here my toungue goes from here to eternity in the wonderland of Chines cuisine.  And it costed a mere $5.25. I am such a winner !!!!"}
{"text":"We moved here from South Dakota the end of June.  We live in Mesa Regal Resort and drive by this restaurant several times a week.  Finally stopped in yesterday.....was I surprised!!! The place is clean and tastefully decorated.  The menu choices were fabulous!  There was a whole page of lunch combos that included egg drop soup, spring roll, wonton, rice and your entree - most under $8!!  I got sesame chicken and it was amazing!!! A thin coating of breading over white pieces of chicken with a delicate sauce....yum!  I'll be back soon!!
P.S. Best egg drop soup I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. It tastes \"clean\".  The food tastes fresh and the oil tastes fresh. Clean restaurant. 
Take out is quick. Prices are very fair.
I've eaten at other Chinese food places in the area and this one is the best by far. Best food, service,prices,cleanliness and nicest largest restaurant  with ample seating and parking. 

I would like to see a better choice of combination plates on the menu for dinner.
The only combos they have are if your sharing with 2 or more people and they have a small list of entrees to choose from for those combinations. 
So I have to get what I want ala cart, which costs more.
But other than that. Everything is great here."}
{"text":"The combination chow mein is perfect!! Just like I've known in Chicago...add some chili paste and chow down!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner and found a clean friendly place. Prices seem to be a bit cheaper than other Chinese restaurants near here. They have a combo that changes based on the number of people ordering.  I had Kung Pao chicken and my lady had Orange chicken. Both were good, the Kung Pao could have had a bit more heat to it (spicy heat). It came with fried rice that was a bit heavy on peas (who started the peas and carrot thing anyway? Not what I grew up with), an egg roll (not nearly as good as Grace Gardens. More of a spring roll to me) and a choice of a couple soups. We had the Wonton soup and it was good. My fiancé said the fried rice was much like she grew up with in a military family when she lived overseas. It had egg in it appropiately, many places don't do that now.

This app won't seem to allow me to give a half star. I would rate them 4.5 stars for price, promptness, cleanliness, and most of the food flavors. 1/2 star reduction for a not so great egg roll and far to many peas in the fried rice, even thou it was good. They have a good selection of beer, wine, and full bar if that's what rocks your boat. We plan on going back."}
{"text":"Fu Sheng is excellent. We love it!!
It doesn't matter what we order, it is always excellent. They use only the freshest ingredients and everyone of their sauces are to die for, Bring your wife. Bring your family, Bring your team or a group of friends. It doesn't matter. Every one will love Fu Sheng."}
{"text":"Refused me alcohol after getting off work. Hadn't been drinking at all. Embarrassed me in front of my whole family. Came here every week for past 2 years and was my go to Chinese restaurant. Lost a loyal customer. Disrespectful."}
{"text":"It was really good but I found a hair in my egg drop soup. I told her and she said oh sorry and walked away. I mean it happens it's fine. Anyways food was great. Got the 9.25 per person deal. Gets you a soup, two apps which is like 1 egg roll, 2 little crab puffs, and then either a low mein or friend rice to share, then you each get a meal. Good food they were quick. Good stuff. That was our second time there we might be back if in mood for real Chinese."}
{"text":"We got there just as the party at the table across was leaving,  naturally their table was full of plates.  Our waitress RAN to our table,  threw down the menu and RAN away.  She returned to take our drink orfers. I ordered Sprite with no ice,  she insisted I wanted Coors lite. We finally got that straighted out after about 5 minutes.  I felt I was in CHINA after talking to her.   Food was average. I tried to ask her for a dessert menu,  she brought us some little cookies and Ran off
 The table that was vacated when we arrived was NEVER cleaned.   NOT very appealing. DON'T waste your time there."}
{"text":"I really like the food there it's in the neighborhood the prices are very reasonable restaurant area is very clean very friendly service and also did I say the food is fantastic"}
{"text":"Since moving from California, my family and I have had literally the hardest time trying to find a decent Chinese food place to call the \"spot\". This place was decent enough, but had some downfalls. 

Food: This should be the bread and butter for any resturant. The food should be strong enough to carry over customers and locals during the summer months. Places really make their money during the winter here, and sadly you can see how places drop in quality when money is tight. Don't get me wrong, I have had WAY WORSE Chinese food around Mesa. They have really nice dinner meal deals which was around $9 bucks per person. This includes an appitizer, a shared rice dish or chicken lo mein, a soup, and 1 entree per person. I asked for chicken chow mein, and was given chicken chop suey. Otherwise, it was ok. Heavily saturated in sticky sweet sauce for any of the other dishes we got. 

Decor: I picked my food up to go because it was straight up dead in the place. There was nobody in the resturant dining in. This usually is a sign to RUN, but I wanted to at least give them the benefit of the doubt since I know about snowbird season. They have a nice fish tank right when you walk in, which I always love. The seating looked nice from what I could see. They also had a nice looking bar, which makes me think that during the winter season, they get more business. 

Overall: I will try them again during the winter, but I'm really upset that I have to get good quality food and service during peak tourism times. I really hope I can find a place that has consistency no matter what time. I would at least try them out, maybe I got food on a bad night?"}
{"text":"My first time here, I only stumbled upon the restaurant because I dropped my car off to get an oil change nearby. I ordered the kung pao chicken lunch special, it came with a soup, egg roll, fried wonton and rice. It was a pretty big portion for just one person but then again I'm small and get full pretty quickly, I took the rest to go. The kung pao chicken was flavorful, the rice not so much it was kinda dry. I wish they had a different type of chili sauce other than the chili in oil they have on the table. The service was blah but I don't expect much quality service from Asian restaurants. The lunch specials range from 5.75 to 7.25 and are served until 3pm daily (dine-in only) so that's good if you wanna grab a quick and cheap bite on a weekend. I will be back again to try the rest of their specials."}
{"text":"Went here last night and absolutely loved it. Had the family combo. The food was fresh and absolutely delicious. The wonton soup was wonderful, as were the egg roll and our entrees. 

I highly suggest dining here!"}
{"text":"If you want some deliciously fresh Chinese food, come check out this place. They are having their grand opening going on right now, it's that new. My husband and I decided to try it out, and we were not disappointed! We were greeted right away upon entering and seated right away. Our waitress took our drink order and quickly returned with the drinks. She gave us time to review the menu. They have two options for sizes, Large which comes with white or fried rice, or the combo which includes an egg roll, fried wonton, 1 crab puff, fried rice and egg drop soup.
I opted for the Large garlic shrimp with white rice. My husband and I shared this as the Large is enough for two people. Be prepared to take a doggie bag home with you. The entree was delicious and arrived quickly. This dish is a bit spicy for my liking, but not overpowering spicy. The rice was cooked perfectly. They do take out, but not delivery. Our waitress was by several times to check on us and was very friendly and attentive.
The place was clean, tastefully decorated and had TV's.  We will be back for eating there and ordering take out to eat at home!"}
{"text":"The Garlic Pork was amazing the best I had.  Egg drop soup was delicious.   Great service too!!"}
{"text":"We came in around 7:30pm. There were a few other  tables seated. The seating area looked clean. What I did notice was there were only two waitresses working, and they were running around looking super busy. After we were seated the waitress took our drink orders, and our food orders. Our soup came out almost immediately, although tasty - was on the cold side. Like it had been prepped and sitting for an extended time. Then we waited for 20 min... no drinks . My son got the attention of the other waitress. And she brought our drinks within a few mins. The entrees were hot, but were average American style Chinese dishes. And we never received drink refills. Bottom line the food was average and the service sucked. I will never go there again. I originally have it a one star. But the price was good. 5 of us ate for around $30.00"}
{"text":"Came here on opening day, no yelp set up for it at that time so I figured why not add my photos and review now, I have been back a few times now as well, honestly I was impressed when I first ate here, but I feel like the quality has somewhat dropped a bit.  The Wonton soup is one of the best things I ate here. The Lunch specials are a good deal. Everything else is fairly typical takeout fair."}
{"text":"We had dinner here twice in the last couple of weeks.  First time my wife had egg fu yung, I had the kung pao chicken.  We thought it was good.

Tonight, my wife had the egg fu yung again.  Wasn't as good as previous.  I tried general Tso's chicken combo.  The breading was hard, the sauce bland.  The hot sour soup seemed 'oily'.  Would not order again. 

Nothing special here."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, it was truly amazing! Chicken fried rice just the way I like it! I don't think I've had this good of Chinese food in the Phoenix area. Will return here again and again. Service was also very good and nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night.  There were five tables with a minimum of two people per table ( one had six) and only one waitress who was scrambling from table to table.  We ordered the family dinner.   It took about ten minutes to get our soup and egg roll which normally comes out sooner at other restaurants.  The soup was lukewarm at best.  When our main entree arrived it too was barely lukewarm.  We saw other people sending their food back to be reheated.  At this point we were so hungry we ate it as it was.  Everything had a good taste and when we reheat it at home I'm sure it will taste better.  We will give this place one more chance but there will be no three strikes."}
{"text":"Great Shrimp Egg Fo Young freshly made and nice size.  Nice people with great customer  service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for great lemon chicken for about 10 years and everywhere I have been has been a disappointment, Finally! Quality chicken breast with a lightly fried crispy flaky crust with an awesome lemon sauce, I want to order another one as I'm typing this I hope they stay consistent"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Omg the tofu was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed this meal."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!  Favorites are the Kung Poa Chicken, the Chicken Chop Suey, Chicken or Veggie Lo Mein, Wor Won Ton soup, Sweet and Sour soup, and the fabulous Crab Puffs!  

We have tried other dishes and they are all amazing but I have just listed my personal favorites.

This is a very clean place and the service is also top notch.  The food is always prepared hot and fresh.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I always enjoyed Sunny World and Fu Seng. Now I know why the food tastes the same (good). I visited there and saw the same waitress that served me when Sunny World was in business. Food is still good BUT they still are still short on extras like when I ask for extra hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce. They water down the mustard so thin I can hardly taste it. I have to go to Walmart and buy their sweet and sour sauce. Place is empty when I go there. I am in hopes that the same thing won't happen as did two years ago. No Sunny World , no Fu Seng.   It's hard to find go Chinese Food here in Az. Wise up Fu Seng."}
{"text":"This place was somewhat busy on a Friday night, with a crowd that reflected the mix of families and retirees in the area. They were pretty short staffed, and the one main waitress was literally running around taking orders. In fact, she then biffed it hard on a part of the floor that had become warped and raised. It seemed to be a new issue.

To her credit, she stayed in the game.

The service was understandably slow, but the food was good. Basic Americanized Chinese staples, executed well. Seemed to have a full bar with no bartender, so we didn't take that adventure. We missed our movie, but overall it was a pretty good experience, with definite room for improvement."}
{"text":"I came here right after they opened. So new they weren't on Yelp yet. This is a nice restaurant with good food. They have traditional Chinese cuisine. There are seafood, pork, beef and chicken dishes typical of most takeout venues. There are combo specials which include an egg roll, fried rice, a crab puff and egg drop soup. They offer a few popular lunch specials at a smaller price.

My wife and I came here for dinner on a Sunday. As we were going in two ladies were going out with to go boxes. They gave us the thumbs up and said it was very good food.We were seated immediately. The waitress took our order. the food was up in just a few minutes. We ordered a large plate of garlic shrimp which we shared. this came with a good sized bowl of white rice. I found the garlic shrimp very good, my wife thought it was a little spicy. I asked if they delivered. They do not. They do have take out though. Just an FYI, they only take plastic or cash. No checks. 
I will be back to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"Don't know where to start.  What's traditional?
I've been eating in Chinese restaurants for 60+
years and the food here was a different take on my usual order. But it was all good.  
Egg drop soup was thin with celery & carrots.
Shrimp with lobster sauce combo had a spring roll rather then an egg roll, a fried wonton and a crab rangoon. A lot of peas & carrots with water chesnuts in the lobster sauce, very light flavor, didn't detect any garlic. Good number of shrimp.  A to-go wonton soup had celery, carrots & shrimp. It was all good, I have to emphasize that.
The interior was nice, the service was prompt.
This was last night approximately 7:30 PM and I was the only one there.
Would I go back, Definitely"}
{"text":"Blagh... My parents were craving Chinese on Dec 23rd and thought id give this place a shot. Its hard to find good Chinese food these days. I called in my order and went to pick up. The location itself was actually pretty nice. More of a nice restaurant then a fast food Chinese place. They even had a bar in there. I got a couple lunch specials beef and broccoli with white rice, Sweet and sour chicken with white rice and sesame chicken combo with fried rice.. This came out to be 28 dollars and change, honestly way to expensive for this food. I asked for sweet and sour sauce and siracha and they gave me 2 tiny little medicine cups of each. The food was just blagh... It was bland, mushy and overall below ok... After 28 bucks we ate what we could and tossed the rest. The search continues for a great Chinese food place in east mesa."}
{"text":"Senior citizen Chinese food. All of the usual dishes at a reasonable price. LUNCH specials $5.75 to $7.75"}
