{"text":"I have been to Roman Bistro twice, once for take out and the other time to eat in. The menu has many options all at reasonable prices. They also have daily specials, that are often made of premium ingredients (seafood, etc.) that are a bit more expensive.

My favourite things I have ordered are: 
* the Roman Bistro (cesar) salad, lots of good bacon and chunks of parm.
* the focaccia, like mini pizzas, very delicious
* the veal sandwiches, very filling. 

The service is a bit slow both for takeout and in restaurant, but well worth it for the delicious food. I will definitely be going back to Roman Bistro."}
{"text":"Drive past here a lot. Always wondered what it was like. Stopped today for a late lunch after looking for houses in the area. Quite impressed. Really good selections on the menu, lots of Italian options. Tasty meal, nice ambience, and good service. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7pm on Monday night.  Not very busy got seated right away We got waited on very quickly I ordered chicken Romano and a house salad my guest ordered chicken parm and a salad we received salads and drinks very quickly. The salads where good .. After that it took an hour and ten minutes for our meals to arrive Are waitress explained they have a large party in the back that's why are meals are taking forever I said ok things happen We finally receive our meals I ordered Chicken Romano I received breaded chicken what looked like Alfredo sauce I have ordered chicken Romano 100 times never came in Alfredo sauce the menu does not say it's in Alfredo sauce Anyway sent it back got a Reuben sandwich and fries it was so salty I ate half the sandwich because I was hungry My guest got the chicken parm which was burnt over gnocchi I tasted the gnocchi it was tasteless..sauce was watered down  The manager did take are meals off bill and gave us dessert.The plain cheesecake I ordered was fair at best seemed like my guest liked his dessert.  I really hope they can get there stuff together The owner does not seem to care by the comments he made on Yelp He made comment come back I'll by you a beer Clueless"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place but that I just love it. There pasta is homemade, there food is authentic Italian and just fantastic. 
You should really give this place a try if your around the area."}
{"text":"Party of four dined on Jan. 25.  Three of four were very happy with entrees.  The pork osso bucco was outstanding as the meat fell off the bone.  The lasagna and ravioli special were similarly tasty.  Only the cioppino was a little off, with an overly spicy flavor.  Salads were nicely prepared and fresh."}
{"text":"Thank you for the personal reply, Mr. Roman. 

We came in for our usual once a week venture and sat at the bar. As I mentioned in the first review, I'm not a big fan of Dutch as my bartender. He was distracted, inattentive, and this time around, rude. I do not drink alcohol. I have a medical condition that keeps me from doing so.  He always treats me as a waste of a bar stool bc I do not order alcohol. My boyfriend ordered his beer, and I ordered my usual iced tea, to which Dutch sighed and not so quietly muttered, \"Figures.\"  Regardless of my reason for not drinking, it was rude and offensive.  I was so infuriated that he was openly passing judgment on me to my face. I wanted to leave then, but my boyfriend wanted to have dinner, drinks, and watch the baseball game.

We asked for menus. They never came. We asked again. He finally gave them to us, and never came back to check to see if we were ready.  I finally flagged him down to place an order to which he walked away and left the bar telling another bartender to take our order. When our food came out, the tortellacci sauce wasn't right. The pesto cream sauce had broken and separated into pesto and lumps on the bottom with a thick layer of oil and butter on top. I was surprised the front of house manager was allowing it to be served. We sent it back. It came back the same way. You and I both know when a sauce is broken, it needs to be 86ed or a new batch needs to be made.  When it came back the second time, we both called it a loss and shared the pizzette I had ordered. 

Finally, I guess there was a problem with a patron at the other end of the bar, but we were unaware of it.  We heard raised voices and who I assume was the manager on duty, two male servers, and Dutch were surrounding a male patron and his guest.  The patron wasn't speaking in a raised voice but the manager was and it was causing a scene to which the manager said, \"Sir you have to leave, you're causing a scene!\"  Dutch loudly said, \"Sir, you are drunk! You need to leave!\"  If he was drunk, the bartender should have cut him off a while ago. Also, it just seemed inappropriate that you would tell an inebriated to get out when he could possibly get into a car and drive off.  I understand the nature of your establishment is a nice, friendly, classier place, but if the goal was to NOT cause a scene, the staff completely missed the mark. 

I'm not saying we are never coming back. We just need a break. 


*****************************
I really wish this place were more consistent. The food is either incredibly good or incredibly bad. There is no in between. We have been coming to this place since it opened because we live in the neighborhood and have sampled pretty much the entire menu with several repeat favorites.  The pastas are what are most inconsistent. From the texture of the pasta (over or under cooked) to the sauces (either the wrong sauce or what seems to be cold sauce from a jar), it's either spot on or a train wreck.  The sandwiches are the same story. The menu says they are built one way, but I have yet to have one served to me the way the menu declares it.  Example being the prime rib sandwich - the meat can be full of flavor or bland. It's supposed to have horseradish aioli on it. Mine had no trace of any aioli and I showed my server. They brought me a cup of it but then proceeded to charge me for it!  Unacceptable to be charged extra for an item that was left off of a sandwich that was advertised to have it included.  

The service is the same as the food. Wonderful or awkward. Some of the staff are very nice and professional. Others are grossly inappropriate.  I once had a server in an effort to be friendly compliment my diamond earrings and presumptuously turn to my male companion and ask why he couldn't buy me a nice diamond ring to go with it ----- bc my companion was my brother for that meal, not my boyfriend!  

I'd say just go there for drinks but even that is hit or miss. If you happen to get Billy, you are in good hands. If you get Dutch, just turn around and leave. You'll never get served or offered a refill bc he's too busy juggling bottles or texting someone.  And I have never had a good female bartender there. Another shining example of awkward service - a newer bartender (and I have not seen her since) over heard my boyfriend and I talking about his job. She asked if he also worked in the restaurant industry, and he said yes, he worked back of the house. She looked at him and said, \"Back of the house guys are all a**holes,\" and walked to the other end of the bar. It was obnoxious and unprofessional. 

I guess I've had my fill of bad experiences there. Last night's meal was the straw that broke the camel's back which prompted this review. Both inconsistent/bad food and horrible service.   Sorry, Mr. Roman. I've met you and you're a nice man, but I hope you can fix your staff soon."}
{"text":"We went here for Thanksgiving because we were celebrating the next day. The food was very good, especially for a buffet. The whole group found something they liked, the wait staff was great, and it wasn't overcrowded, as I feared. I know that we won't hesitate to do something like this for future holidays. Just one problem, no leftovers!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times for Sunday brunch so last Friday I decided to stop by for the happy hour. Seeing no hostess, I decided to try to find a seat at the bar. Since I couldn't find an available seat at the bar I sat down at one of the two available two person high tops directly behind the bar. After a few minutes the hostess came by my table and thoroughly scolded me for having the nerve to seat myself. I tried to explain to her that no one was at the hostess station but she would have none of it.  After she walked away the waitress came by and gave me an additional scolding.  I was told the seats were reserved. I offered to leave since as an adult I am not used to being scolded.  After about five minutes of back and forth I decided to stay. I order food and beer and sat for about an hour. Of course no one came to claim the RESERVED table. 
What a humiliating experience. I will not be back for Sunday brunch or happy hour."}
{"text":"Before I begin this review, I want to let you know that I have given this restaurant the benefit of the doubt FIVE times, always leaving disappointed in some way.  Last night was the \"clincher\" -- I went with my husband and several friends for dinner.  I ordered the Cod Father (which was better THIS time -- last few times it had been way too spicy for a fish sandwich, in my opinion); my husband had the scallops (4 scallops and a small side of vegetables which he said were very good); our two friends ordered the lobster ravioli, also served with a small side of vegetables (they, too, thought their meals were good).  Putting aside the fact that I think the meals are way over-priced for what you get (i.e. very small portions) and that everything else is ala cart, we all enjoyed our evening.  Then came the bill fiasco.   My husband and I picked up the bill and were paying part with a credit card and part with a gift card we had received for Christmas 2013.  After 15 minutes the waiter came over to apologize for the delay but since our gift card was \"old\" they couldn't process it (apparently they just got a new computer program which couldn't  \"read\" the card).  He indicated that the manager was on the phone with the card company trying to figure out how to process the card.  I advised him to just put the entire bill on the credit card and give us a \"new\" gift card.   After another 10 minutes he came back and said \"are you sure you want me to charge this to your credit card -- we can wait until we reach someone and figure out your gift card?\"  I said no, we really needed to leave and just use my credit card.  After ANOTHER 5 minutes the manager came over and said that she was \"working on\" the gift card issue but really couldn't do anything until she reached someone at the gift card company.  We AGAIN asked that the bill be charged to my credit card and that she could reimburse us for the amount of the gift card.  Nope, she couldn't do that.  My husband finally told her to call the owner (which she must have done because it was no more than a minute or so later that she came over with our cash refund of the gift card).  During this entire fiasco (which took over 30 minutes) we were not offered a complimentary drink or desert (or even a piece of candy!) for our inconvenience.  What she did finally say was that we were welcome to come back again for a complimentary meal.  Having said that, we were not given anything to PROVE we could have a free meal, just her word.   In sum:  Food is good (but overpriced and small portions); Service: our waiter was very good (and extremely apologetic); the manager, in my opinion, seemed incompetent with respect to holding a \"managerial position\" and was certainly not concerned with resolving/satisfying a customer complaint.  I know this review is lengthy (now you know how WE felt waiting for our check!) but I wanted to be totally honest."}
{"text":"I ask so thrilled to finally found a local place that has excellent food and marvelous service. 
My husband and I selected Roman Bistro on the recommendation of a car friend. I met her the night prior for happy hour and had the amazing crab cake. 
The next night my husband and I were back for a summer Friday date night. We reserved ahead via the website and dined outside. Out later Corey was absolutely outstanding in fact I have dubbed him the king of all waiters and I hope that the next time I'm in I will see him on the Roman bistro  server walk of fame. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and the bar but he also gave excellent recommendations off of the menu. And was quite attentive to US during our evening.
I have their version of shrimp scampi only with a light creamy sauce with pine nuts. 
My husband had another delusions pasta dish with sausage clams calamari muscles. 
The portions were grande vente even, and really will delight again on the leftovers tomorrow. 
Thanks Roman Bistro... Thank you Corey... Server Extrodinair! See you all soon."}
{"text":"We went to the Sunday brunch.  Very disappointed because there was not enough meat, only ham and salmon.  Mostly breakfast items, and stuffed shells.  The desserts were okay.  We were charged for iced tea, 2.50 each and I also wanted coffee, 1.50 I think.. Our bill was 46.00 dollars!!!!!!  I will not go again.  Oh, one more thing.  We wanted more ham, they were out, no more...gonzo!!!  Price is way too high."}
{"text":"Mike,

Not first time at bar.  Dining room service has always been fine. Bar service doesn't seem to understand how to treat customers. This has been my experience a couple of times there. It's almost like you are bothering them by being there. And I'm sure you know that your beer prices aren't exactly the cheapest, which I am fine with as long as that comes with exceptional service... This is not the case.

Kevin"}
{"text":"worst service ever. went number 2 right away at restaurant in dirty bathrooms where the toilet wouldnt flush"}
{"text":"Great meal here. Expensive for what you get, so save this place for a special occasion. Food and staff is great though... Definitely recommend Roman Bistro!"}
{"text":"The food blew me away! I wasn't sure what to expect but it was outstanding, quality food. I got the pollo ala cuomo and my boyfriend had the osso bucco. My mouth waters even now just thinking about it. My mom got the salmon and my sister got the scallops and they raved about them as well. Also I had the stone cap Syrah which was a bright and delicious wine served in a big beautiful glass. I can't wait for the next occasion to go back! This place is not to be underestimated."}
{"text":"Brunch here today. Great food for an affordable price. Everyone so nice. Our server was awesome."}
{"text":"New delightful bistro that has opened up in Newmarket joining the small but quickly growing Italian hot table business in the area. I have been here 3 times and my overall experience has been quite good.

To begin with there are a lot of specials that change weekly so it keeps the menu interesting and I normally order one of them. The food is cooked to order so it does take some time but they have quick hot table options available if you are in a rush. Their veal dishes are perfected and have generous portions, also their sausage dishes have a wonderful herb flavor that I have yet to find elsewhere.

Since it is a new business it is understandable that the service requires some experience, but it was not unpleasant overall. However during busy nights the inexperience shows as the staff have a hard time keeping up with the traffic and orders. Also on busy nights I feel the quality of the food suffered a little but it might just have been my dish (lobster with calamari in white wine sauce).  They have a nice selection of teas and desserts and cater as well.

Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for some Italian food in the Newmarket area, for a quick fix or a proper meal Roman Bistro has good variety and good food."}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner for the first time. They have an extensive beer selection and food menu. I was very pleased with the service from start to finish. 
My waitress was very attentive and my Garlic Shrimp was delicious. The White Sangria was pretty tasty too! ;)
I will definitely go back soon, perhaps to check out their brunch. Certainly worth a try if you enjoy Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"This is a great independent restaurant with tasty, imaginative food at good prices.  The selection of draft beer is very impressive.  French fries are real fresh cut and rival what you get at the Kennywood Potato Patch. My husband had the beans and greens and it was the best version of this classic that we have had in a long time.  Even their tiramasu had a delicious  twist with a raspberry garnish. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The decor and atmosphere are lovely.  Bathrooms are super clean. We intend to make this our new favorite.place."}
{"text":"I went there for a business lunch. I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich and it was outstanding. The chicken was perfect and the sauce was awesome as well. There were 5 of us all together and everyone enjoyed their meals. The only reason it's not 5 out of 5 as it was very loud in there, it could have just been the other guests but I found it annoying. I would gladly go back for lunch."}
{"text":"The lasagna was perfect. I heard one of the waitresses saying that they are getting a tv some time next week. Waitress staff is nice. As I am 14 I can say that this is a good place for children. Overall great experience, would come again"}
{"text":"Service was below standard and the food really was not good. Salad was stringy, chicken breast dry and void of flavor, desserts very small portions. Only good thing was the interior of this establishment!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my boyfriend and his sister for lunch.  Was somewhat crowded being st Patricks weekend.  When we got there the dining room was busy.  The bar wasn't so busy so they seated us at two high top tables pushed together which was fine.  The bartender was our waitress. There was a waiter who was also helping our table. He wasn't friendly at all and seemed very unpleasant.  To get to the point.  Food was pretty good. But no one came to check on us or see if we needed anything.  I had to ask two other servers for ketchup and refills on all of our drinks.  I had an empty glass from before my meal came out and long after I finished.  In my opinion that is poor service."}
{"text":"It couldn't have been worse had they tried. No silverware  and what ever you do avoid the calamari."}
{"text":"Awesome food, nice bar, outdoor seating, and top notch service by Kenya... will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Invited 26 people for Sunday brunch this past weekend.  The staff was very accommodating and the buffet selections were fabulous!  They had everything from the traditional breakfast foods to some great proteins and pasta options. Other choices included a cold station and dessert table.  Honestly, the only drawback was that the omelet station had a rather long line--which didn't bother me because I did not order an omelet!!  Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"This review is the culmination of two visits where I ordered the following:

1. Proscuitto e Arugula Pizzette & Bistro Burger

2. Caprese Salad and Chicken Saltimbocca

Service: Adequate. Basically did what they were supposed to. I went at very off peak times so they were not busy, but on both occasions I was both seated and served quickly and my glass was refilled when needed.

Food:

Pizzette - way too doughy for me. I was informed before ordering it was not a traditional flatbread so I was not expecting that, but I also was not expecting something that more resembled deep-dish or a loaf of bread. Toppings were virtually non-existent. 1 small slice of tomato on each piece, and maybe one slice each of mozzarella and proscuitto spread out over the entire dish. For $12 me thinks not. 

Bistro Burger (ordered medium) - My impression was this was one of the those previously frozen burger patties from Costco, or at least it looked and tasted exactly like I remember them. Overcooked slightly but on these type of burger patties that's kind of hard not to do frtom personal experience. The pork belly was clearly cooked days earlier and just pulled out for the burger. Again, for $12 me thinks not. I can pay the same at Burgatory or Wingharts or any other host of places and not get a frozen pattie in the process, plus they are larger. 

Caprese Salad - Fine, what it was supposed to be. 

Saltimbocca - Pretty good. Probably the most enjoyable thing I ordered. Though not something I would make a special trip for. A little on the salty side as they probably season the chicken breast even though they are placing a very salty piece of prosciutto on it. 

The bottom line is the meal prices just don't jive with either the portion sizes or the quality of ingredients. You can easily charge $12 for a burger...just not a frozen patty one. If I wanted that I would go to Wendy's and pay 1/4 of that. 

The biggest beef (no pun intended) I have with the place, are shady business practices. I purchased 2 DoubleTakeDeal vouchers good for $40 worth of casual dining. 

On my first visit, which was a Friday afternoon, this process was executed flawlessly as I pulled the voucher up on my phone and the served recorded the number and applied it to my bill. 

My schedule allowed me to return the following day, Saturday, for lunch as well. Here I was told these vouchers are not permitted to be used on Friday's and Saturday's. I responded that was odd since I had done that very thing just the day before without incident and without any mention of said policy to not honor these certificates on Friday's and Saturday's. Just as importantly, I commented this stipulation is listed no where on the voucher or on the DoubleTakeDeals page. As such, by law they should be required to honor the certificate. They chose not too. If it were my mistake and I simply did not read thoroughly that's on me, but this was not the case in this situation. I just have no patience for business practices like this, particularly as a small business owner myself. If it were me, even if it did say it wasn't valid then, I would have made an exception and honored it for the day as a good faith gesture considering someone took time out of there day to drive to my establishment and had already sat down to order. Particularly on a day were my restaurant had maybe 15 people in it. 

I've already requested a refund from DoubleTakeDeals for my remaining voucher and hopefully never have to return to this place. I can see why the reviews are what they are."}
{"text":"I was very impressed at the food and ambiance of the Place.  Forest hills has very little to offer when it comes to bistro settings.  This place combines the bistro atmosphere, wine, craft beer, great food and a large and diverse menu. 

The salmon was grilled and exceptional.  I recommend it highly.  

Also, Tuesday is half off the house wine which was a pleasant find."}
{"text":"Food is good. Not mind boggling, but very reasonably priced considering the relative quality. 

Nice interior, but little to no ambience. Definitely not somewhere to go out for dinner, but rather a place to grab lunch or a casual meal. 

I would return, but not in hurry. Maybe if I'm craving a veal sandwich?"}
{"text":"This was our second trip to Roman's. The first time I had the \"bacon and eggs\" small plate - pork belly, a crab cake, sunny side up egg, arugula and tomato pesto. It was crazy good and really a meal. My husband had the Caprese flatbread - very fresh and ripe tomatoes. Tonight I had the beans & greens, and was again impressed. Another small plate, but easily enough leftover for lunch tomorrow. Husband had the char-grilled wings with the garlic basil butter. That, too, was a small plate but these were \"real\" wings, not some sort of wing ding thing. Each was meaty and we took home three. God bless them for having some interesting, and fairly priced, wines to try! It's still very early in the going, but I think Roman Bistro is off to a great start!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood place near my fiance that has a friendly corkage policy.  Super nice and friendly staff with very good service.  If you want to eat outdoors you'll be contending with a boulevard, parking lot, and smokers.  Inside is nicer.  The salads were excellent, and the two dishes we had (veal parmigiana and linguine with clams) were in the good to very good category. The pasta did have a different consistency that may be due to their homemade recipe perhaps...it was good, but not great.  The veal and clams were also good, but not great.  I would go back and try some other dishes next time."}
{"text":"Today will be my final visit to roman bistro. Since it opened, my husband and I frequented there for dinner several times per month, in addition to some later night bar stops. We have noticed a decline in both service and food quality over the past 6-8 months. The service is consistently slow regardless of the order, time of day, crowd level. We had my fathers surprise 70th party there in February. We reserved the  party room for the event. Upon arrival that day, we learned we had been moved to the back dining area because a baby shower had displaced us. Isn't this why I made a deposit? To reserve the room? Instead we were awkwardly put in the dining room, making the seating difficult and service less than stellar. I was not pleased with the party, the hostess was less than pleasant, especially considering the hefty bill that came with the party. 

Nonetheless, we have been back a few more times since then and have noticed the decline in service and quality, but remained hopeful it could return to its promising beginning. Unfortunately, I came to realize today that day will not come, especially now that the owner's focus will be on the new mount Washington location.

My mom and I arrived for Lunch at noon to a fairly empty room. It took 15 minutes to be greeted by a server to take our drink order. Seeing this lack of attention, we placed our food order as well. It took 35 minutes to receive our food-a sandwich and salmon salad. During our wait, a large party arrived in the bar area, and there were only two servers to take care of the entire area! The host was running orders and making drinks. How do you staff this way for a lunch rush? My moms sandwich was fine when it finally arrived. My salad was another story. The salmon was just ok. The lettuce was completely brown and wilted. I ate the salmon and waited for the server to return  to check on us and our food and planned to show him the brown/wilted lettuce that filled the $14 bowl. He never came back. Not once.No one ever came back to check on us, to fill our drinks, nothing. After another 15-20 minutes I had to seek out the one other server to ask for our check and a box for my mom. She was visibly annoyed with my request. The host finally brought both over without asking a word about our meals/experience. I am beyond frustrated and disappointed with our experience today at a dining establishment that classifies themselves as a superior place for meals. I would have been better off at panera for my salad."}
{"text":"Blaah. Went with the family for lunch. All of our food was average at best. Nobody enjoyed their food and no of us wants to return. The chicken strips were the blandest thing I have ever eaten. The Cubano sandwich wasn't good either (I know, I'm in Pittsburgh, not Miami). The atmosphere and the staff were very nice though."}
{"text":"On a less than busy, post lunch rush stop, we were less than thrilled with our visit.

There were two issues with getting our order right, and there wasn't anything special about the orders... Sides and salad dressings were messed up.  Simply the kitchen not reading tickets on a leisurely afternoon.

One meal was fine, the other dry and with the tell tale signs of being under the lights in the window for too long.

The server was attentive when flagged down but slow and scattered on her own.

All of the mistakes combined mean not only will we not return, but we will be sure to discourage friends looking for a bite in Forest Hills from visiting."}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection and menu has plenty of delicious options to please both carnivores and vegetarians. The Sunday brunch buffet is a good value with made to order omelets, waffles, and plenty of brunch and dessert options! Highly recommend the pork osso bucco. One problem I have with the Roman Bistro is the food can be very inconsistent. I pick up takeout often and the last 3x we've ordered the same sandwiches, they have came on 3 different buns. One week a hamburger bun, next week hoagie roll, the week after that ciabatta rolls. My husband was so irritated about a fish sandwich on a ciabatta bun I won't be picking it up again anytime soon. I don't know if it's a matter of them running out of the right stuff, but when you have to substitute ingredients this information should really be communicated. The vegetables of the day seem to be an afterthought as well."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!! We hosted my daughters Confirmation on a Sunday afternoon (the restaurant was closed so we had the place to ourselves).  We had 27 guests but they could easily accommodate 45-50. Ambiance is fresh and contemporary! 

Service is outstanding! Attentive, accommodating and friendly! We never wanted for anything. If we needed refills, they appeared, wine was replenished as soon as there was 1/3 bottle left, bread etc was plentiful always:) 

Food-antipasto platters were heaping with fresh prosciutto, cured salami and a huge assortment of pickled and grilled veggies with marinated olives and bocconcini! Delish:)))
The mussels were super fresh, meaty and cooked to perfection in s light marinara sauce! Yummo:) 
Fried calamari-I like to consider myself a bit of a connoisseur  of calamari and hands down THESE ARE SIMPLY THE BEST IVE EVER HAD!!! Worth the drive to Newmarket just to try these, I promise you will not be disappointed!

Onto the pasta course-Rotolo with ricotta and spinach in a white sauce that was so silky and smooth with a rich savoury taste along side penne with red sauce that rivals my nonna's (sorry nonna)

Meat course- rib steak was prepared to medium however they asked beforehand if anyone would like it well done:) Either way it was prepared the end result was simply perfection!!! We had many steak lovers in attendance and picky ones at that! Not a one complaint! Instead, MANY rave reviews from said picky people!!!

Fruit- fresh, seasonal and nicely plated!!! No complaints here:)

They cut my cake and served it as well!

Franca and her staff way surpassed all my expectations!!! 

You must eat here:)))"}
{"text":"We went there for brunch and I had a pleasant time.  The furnishings and ambience were comfortable and there was plenty of room to move about. Service was decent but i think a few minor tweaks could really improve it. For instance, perhaps they are understaffed, but it wouldn't hurt for the server to at least make eye-contact or some kind of contact with the table so we aren't sitting there wondering what is going on.

But on to the more important stuff - the food. The brunch had a nice variety of options including an omelet bar, lots of breakfast sweet breads like cinnamon rolls, pancakes, french toast,etc.  Their smoked salmon was a nice touch and tasted fresh. Their lunch options were a bit more meager ... including linguini in a pesto sauce, baked fish, chili, and perogies. As we were there before 11 perhaps they change the brunch menu as the day progresses. Breakfast or lunch, the dessert selections were great.  I highly recommend the oreo rice-krispy treats and the chocolate chip cookies.  Also, the bacon and sausage were a step-up from traditional breakfast meats.

Either way, I thought it was a fair deal for $13 although I was a little surprised that coffee was additional but I liked that they didn't go crazy on the price.  Coffee was $2.

A few quibbles ...

Brew the coffee stronger - it looked like tea in the cup and one creamer turned it milk-like

Set the toaster to go a little darker - i realize that this could be difficult or that perhaps the user is to adjust it

Add a few lighter options, including more fruit, yogurt, etc.

I look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Delicious!  The restaurant was very busy when I dined for dinner with a friend. We didn't have reservations and were seated quickly. Service was great and food was amazing. The tomato sauce was some of the best I've ever had, and the chicken parmigiana was so moist and tasty!  Highly recommend this lovely spot, and will be going again soon"}
{"text":"I really love the Roman Bistro.  The service is great and the food is pretty consistently good.  I wish the pasta was fresh, however.  The portions are huge so don't let the price of the entrees scare you away.  I also really enjoy the atmosphere!  I've had the chicken Parmesan most recently and it was quite good."}
{"text":"Roman Bistro is one of my new favorite dining destinations in Pittsburgh. We had an excellent family dinner on Thursday night. Food was amazing. celebrated our mothers birthday and they took great care of us. A+ for food, service, and Tammy who welcomed us."}
{"text":"I ordered a strawberry salad as a togo order.  When i got home I noticed they gave me blue cheese instead of goat cheese, they did not put the walnuts on my salad and they gave me balsamic vinaigrette and Greek (I think it was Greek, that's what it tastes like) dressing instead of the yogurt vinaigrette.  I've never ordered to go from roman bistro before but it definitely isn't the way to go.  Check your food before you leave or just eat in..."}
{"text":"We were here for the first time today.  My mother suggested the restaurant for our wedding reception.  Granted, our reservation was only for 8 people, but that's still a fairly large party for the lunchtime rush.  Our waitress, Angela, was superb!  Friendly and accommodating, Angela was prompt with refills on drinks, and checked on our table just the right amount of times.  

 As for the food, it was definitely above par.  This place far exceeds the quickie joints like Olive Garden, and the former Italian Oven.  There are a plethora of choices - sandwiches, salads, soups, pizza, pasta, chicken, fish, meats, desserts.  Our party ordered from various parts of the menu, and all came out as expected or better.  I had the butternut squash ravioli.  The ravioli were sweet, and tasted delicious, the cream sauce was light, and there were an adequate amount of veggies mixed in.  My partner had the fettuccine alfredo with shrimp.  The sauce was thick and creamy, and there was no skimping on the shrimp.  Oh, and the appetizer choices - so very unique!  We had the fried brussel sprouts with balsalmic glaze, gorgonzola, and walnuts  (they were more roasted/pan fryed - lightly - which I preferred - the outsides were all caramelized and crunchy - yum!), and greens and beans (these are vegetarian, btw.  Normally, veggie greens and beans aren't a thing at restaurants - at least the ones I've been to.).  

Great place, clean environment, pleasant, fast service, yummy food - I'd say this place is definitely worth 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"We've tried Roman Bistro several times over a few years and in roughly a third of our visits have been disappointed.  The waitstaff is professional and caring, but the management is not willing to take responsibility or try to satisfy in the face of problems.  Tonight, two of us were served while the third member of our party waited for about 10 minutes before being served.  The manager made no apologies and insisted that we had only waited 4 minutes and gave us a card for a free desert next time we bought a dinner there.  Never again."}
{"text":"This was my first time Brunching at Roman Bistro!! And it was AMAZING!!!! They had a variety of breakfast and lunch options, an omelette and waffle bar that are made to order, and mimosas ( I didn't try yet). Chef RJ was the omelette and waffle man while we were there and he was so funny, personable, and friendly.  My friends and I receive great customer service from him and our waitress Sara!!  It was a beautiful day, so we sat outside and the ambiance was nice and peaceful!  The food was warm and delicious.  My friend is an EXTREMELY picky eater - and she enjoyed herself.  
This is a great place for Sunday Brunch by yourself or with friends and family!  I will definitely be back ... hope to see you there!!"}
{"text":"I have been here about a dozen times. It is the only sort of fancy restaurant in this area. Last night I ordered from the the \"Valentines\" menu. I ordered the Surf& Turf /8 oz fillet (med. rare), and Turf/7 oz Lobster tail. What I received was a med-med-well filet, and a 4 oz tail. When I brought this up with my server, the manager came back, insisting that it was 6.5 oz, but at the same time offering a second 4 oz tail one to make up the difference. About 6 months ago I ordered a prime rib for lunch, and was served a sirloin, as I wouldn't notice? The manager \"Fred\" said that the cook probably opened the wrong pouch as that's how they receive them. Another time I was there on Sunday night which is \"Prime Rib\" night, and had to explain to my server what an end cut was, she had never heard of it? Maybe I should stick with the Hamburger which most people seem to get and it  looks good!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times. Great Tuesday night wine discount and happy hour. Tonight the bartender was so rude, dismissive and angry we almost walked out. However, it's so out of the way we moved into the dining room. I worked with an Alzheimer's patient all day, my friend is in probation. Just because after 5 minutes my friend tried to wave down the bartender didn't give him the right to start screaming at her from across the bar. I will never return here or will at least call and make sure that Dutch is not bartending. It truly ruined our dining experience even if they did comp us a couple appetizers."}
{"text":"This place is great. High quality food and very nice inside. It's classic in look and menu style. Every day offers a different deal and specials. They always have wine tasting beer tasting and entertainment. Their Sunday all you can eat brunch is amazing as well as endless. It features everything from made to order waffles to a slab of fresh salmon. I have never been disappointed in anything I have eaten here. Not a food chain and done properly."}
{"text":"Bridget was awesome! She helped us navigate the menu and we loved everything. The Osso bucco is rich and yummy. I could do without the cheesy carb on the plate - was it potatoes or grits? I don't know. But otherwise, delicious. Great place for a date!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since my first review and unfortunately this place has gone down hill for me. I don't know where to begin..

Let's just start with the food. I'm always so disappointed with the food. With every experience I feel that I'm  making up excuses for them like \"oh maybe they're having a bad day\" and end up giving them another chance. After all my excuses I've come to realize the food here is not good. Undercooked. Overcooked. Not flavored well. Watery sauce. Too thick of sauce. Stale bread. The dishes aren't consistent. This list goes on.. I'm almost ashamed to say this but you're better off going to Olive Garden.

While I love to support local businesses, unfortunately I cannot continue. It's a shame because I really wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Monday Night for dinner and we were warmly greeted by the entire staff . We had a Groupon . The food was delicious . The wine reasonably priced. We enjoyed dinner very much . The reason this dinner was memorable was the great Customer Service. The hostess was wonderful. Our server , Bridget , went above and beyond helping us with our menu selections. She also helped us set up the rewards app on my phone for a return visit . The new manager stopped by several times to see how we were doing . We really appreciated the great service .  We did see on several sites that it has a cigar bar which I was very excited about . However, we were told it no longer exists because of complaints.  I was disappointed but the food and service made up for it . We shall return!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible for a decent steak or caring service. I can't believe I wasted my hard earned money dining here. I grew up close by and keep giving this place a chance but I've reached my limit. Mike Roman needs to buy better meat and train his bar staff to be professional and caring servers. Next time I'll go to giant eagle and grill it myself."}
{"text":"First visit over the weekend...food and service was very good...will definitely go back in the near future.  It's a must try"}
{"text":"I relocated from NYC last year and my family from NYC came to visit and we were craving authentic Italian food. I heard some reviews from ppl and decided to come to Roman Bistro. My family consist of a group of 10 ppl and everyone ordered and said they enjoyed every bit. I ordered the Rigatoni with al la vodka sauce and pancetta. It was so good. This will be my go to restaurant for Italian food. I'm going to try to visit on Wednesdays to create your own pasta but the dishes on the menu are really tasty."}
{"text":"Everythings was good. I went with my children for dinner and enjoyed are dining experience. Waitress was super friendly!!! Will reture."}
{"text":"I agree that the food is very good and the portions a bit bigger than usual in this type of restaurant. Service is acceptable.

The one thing that has puzzled me is the specials. Same as the menu, same price, no change. What is so special to make them special? Maybe they are on a learning curve.

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Went here last night. Ordered a burger medium. The burger was cooked well done and charred on the outside. Ordered a beet salad that came as a house salad. Server took it back to kitchen & when it came to the table, it was still the house salad with beets added to it. Server got 2 checks totally wrong. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there tonight, not my first visit. Previously have been very satisfied. Our waitress was a little slow, and orders were mixed. Food was prepared incorrectly or given to wrong person. (Steaks) Pasta was good, bread plentiful and appetizer tasty. There was a fire alarm which was incredibly loud, and I understand the necessity of this, but after we had to leave the first time, I think they could have comped a drink or two for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"I went into Roman Bistro with an open mind. I'm always interested in trying new independent restaurants in my area. We had a party of four on an April Friday night with reservations. We were about 15mins late for our reservations and they called to make sure we were still coming which was nice. The wait wasn't too long after we got there and was seated in the back room. Our waiter seemed shy and new on the job. We couldn't hear what he was saying and seemed to bounce around a lot. I ordered the Veal Parmesan as I was interested in trying an entree rather than my usual sandwich. Another member in our group ordered the lasagna and the waiter exclaimed that it after 15 minutes he placed the order wrong and it would be late. A beet salad was offered in exchange for this mistake. After 35/40 mins the food came out and was not very appealing. I began to cut into my veal and to my surprise it looked and tasted like chicken. I showed the waiter and he told me he didn't know what to say. The manager came over and told me it was veal. I showed him it clearly wasn't. He said they checked and it was veal that was ordered. I exclaimed that I understood that but I have chicken on my plate. After more arguing he went to the kitchen to investigate. Apparently someone got my veal and never realized it wasn't chicken. I was semi-satisfied with the chicken as I didn't want to wait for fresh veal and I never send anything back to the kitchen. The pasta was old and sticky and the sauce was horrible. This is not an Italian cuisine restaurant even though the name might suggest Roman food. The lasagne ended up coming out on time although it was obviously is was microwaved. Everyone's food was sub-par and the prices are double what they should be. I ended up not having to pay for me chicken/veal Parmesan which is the only positive I can take away from the horrible excuse for fine cuisine."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hidden places in Forest Hills. They're food is excellent and the space is really nice. Their gnocchi is definitely worth ordering. They're brunch on Sunday is really good as well."}
{"text":"With over a dozen visits to the Roman Bistro, I have come to the sad realization that a degradation in quality and service accompanied each sequential trek to the restaurant. Quite simply, I think the problem is one of consistency wherein the menu items (and the menu itself) are too variable and too unreliable, tasting and looking from visit to visit. Prior ordered favorites become a memory. This may be traced to different food preparers or \"off days\" in the kitchen. My most recent (and likely last) visit brought forth flatbread which was basically a shingle of matzo cracker with some forlorn chopped veggies aboard with a dollop of dipping sauce. The beet salad, lifeless lettuce partnered with a few canned beets, was sad indeed. I would bet that the chefs/cooks have been in transition and turn over. A place of promise, unfulfilled."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times. The food has been decent. The service is not so good. This evening was the worst. We were here with a group of eight and had a reservation. We were seated, got our drinks, and waited to give our order. We waited for 30 minutes for salads and soup and had to ask for bread. An hour later, our meals still were not served. No explanation, or apology. The meals were served after we spoke to the manager.Once we got our food, it was tasty. But the wait was unacceptable."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and so was the service. Brandon and Cody took great care of us, and the stuffed banana peppers and ravioli were both superb! This was our first time. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Where to start!
Great food. 
Amazing service. 
Our server this evening was attentive and helpful thanks RACHEL W for a great anniversary dinner!!"}
{"text":"High quality Italian food. All of your favorites and probably a few surprises. 

Got the Veal Piccata. Solid A. 

Service is good. Great staff."}
{"text":"Another excellent meal at RB. Our waiter's name was Drew, he was so pleasant and attentive and we received TOP NOTCH service. This visit we had the Romans revenge wings and shrimp appetizer and enjoyed both. The Gouda burger was fabulous as always and the Poutine is too amazing to pass up on any visit! Just go eat here! Happy hour specials are great too."}
{"text":"The staff was outstanding.  Food was average.  Salads are excellent and a good value.  The restaurant is a good place for a family meal."}
{"text":"Went with two friends. All the wait staff was friendly and helpful. I had the lasagna and I have to say that it was the absolute best I have ever had!  My other friends had gnocchi and they loved it as well. Great portions too!  Without a doubt I would highly recommend Roman Bistro!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere would go back to try different menu items. I wasn't a fan of the ceaser shrimp salad. It had zucchini and string beans in it. It was different but not in a good way. The shrimp were good. Seasoned right and they gave a nice portion."}
{"text":"This place has to go back to basics. The menu is too big and it's basically a slightly (just slightly) upscale diner. The brunch I had a year or so ago was good but the best foods were not the italian foods. I was there for lunch a few times the last six months or so and it's steadily declining. The wait staff too is declining which is as important as the food. The last waitress (Kenya I think) was clearly tolerating having to wait on us. She wasn't openly hostile or rude but not exactly welcoming. I hope they can get their act together before it's too late."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short. Nice restaurant. Some good wait staff and some bad. Food is mostly good but I tried a burger once and did not care for it. I asked for medium well and it was bloody. I have to say the parking is wonderful and the decor is very nice but when you walk in from the outside, they have some kind of potpourri in the entrance area that is way too strong smelling. You expect to get an aroma of good food but this potpourri ruins any chance of that. It is a bad smell and should be removed. Another negative is the noise in the front room bar area. Way too noisy if you want to have a nice dinner and conversation. Ask to be seated in the back if you want to hear yourself talk. Also it's a little pricey for forest hills. And they need to offer more domestic beers. Too many fancy beers. They really need to serve Budweiser. I have seen people leave when they hear there is no Bud."}
{"text":"I used to live in the area and have tried this restaurant on three occasions. The staff is very nice however, the food is lacking. I have tried multiple things, trying to give it a chance, and have been unimpressed. Very mediocre, and not for the price. I would rather go to eat and park. This said, I have moved out of the area, and will not return or reccomend this restaurant to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I visited Roman Bistro with a couple of good friends this past Sat. evening at around 6:30.  I normally don't get out this way too often, but my friends' house is nearby and they're frequent customers, so they invited me to dinner with them here.  Given that they enjoy Roman Bistro, I was keen to check out one of their favorite haunts, so I took them up on their offer.

Our visit got off to a bit of a rocky start when no waitstaff came to greet us for 10 min. after being seated, so one of my friends went to inform the hostess.  At that point, a waitress came to greet us within a couple of minutes, accompanied by a manager who offered us comped appetizers.  We took the manager up on this offer and got two orders of the bada bing shrimp ($13 each), which turned out to be delicious, with just the right amount of spice and a nice crunch.  We also ordered drinks, with one of my friends ordering a beer, and my other friend and I ordering their specialty martinis (chocolate and strawberry blond, respectively; $8, -$1 with Yelp check-in discount).  When my martini was served, I took a sip and then noticed something that turned out to be a fruit fly in my drink, so the waitress apologetically got me another one.  Be forewarned that this drink must be a major fruit fly attractor, since my second drink was served without any fruit flies, but one got into it as I sipped on it throughout the meal (this time, I fished it out without complaint).

For our entrees, I ordered the chicken artichoke piccata ($21), one friend ordered the flatiron steak ($23), and the other ordered the pumpkin ravioli special ($24).  Additionally, each of us ordered a side of soup or salad with our meal ($4 each).  I ordered the New England Clam Chowder, which was thick and had a decent amount of clam, but was rather salty.  My chicken piccata, which consisted of grilled chicken breasts over linguine with capers and artichokes in a lemon butter sauce, was quite delicious, and was a big enough portion for two meals (I ate half there and the other half for dinner the next night).  Because I don't eat beef, I didn't try the steak, but my friend who ordered it seemed quite satisfied with it.  The star of the show, though, was the pumpkin ravioli that my other friend ordered, which she generously let me sample.  The filling consisted of pumpkin and mascarpone cheese, and was rich yet seemed light and airy, and was dressed with an allspice cream sauce.  If you see this seasonal item on the menu and you enjoy pumpkin, be sure to order it--you won't be disappointed!

Before heading back to my friends' house, all of us ordered dessert to go.  One friend and I ordered the death by chocolate ($7), a huge slice of chocolate cake with chocolate icing and shavings drizzled with chocolate sauce.  Needless to say, if you're a chocoholic, this is the dessert for you!  My other friend ordered a slice of the NY cheesecake topped with raspberry sauce ($7), which I didn't try but looked delicious.

Despite the rocky start, my friends and I were quite satisfied with the service from our waitress, Lori Anne, throughout the meal.  While I ordered more than I usually do when dining out, and I thought the price point was a tad steep, I can't complain too much, given the comped apps and drink and the slight drink discount.  Based on the crowd and clientele and the casual atmosphere, it's clear that that Roman Bistro is a favorite haunt of the locals, and I can see why."}
{"text":"I always rate 5 starts when i eat well, served well, and charged well!
This place has a very unique style, staff are so friendly, they take your order with a real smile. 
I will go back again many times for sure."}
{"text":"On March 3rd, 1130-1245, I went for lunch with a friend. Waiter was cool but the service not too good. I ordered half sandwich (salami & cheese) with soup. My friend got the prime rib sandwich. It took about 10 minutes for my half sandwich to arrive after her prime rib sandwich arrived. (don't know if they forgot?) it wasn't very crowded for 1130am so I couldn't give that benefit of a doubt). The food was greasy and not really tasty. Once we were done, we piled up our plates. Waiting 25 minutes for the check. Wedding soup was fantastic, atmosphere very nice. I may return because of the convenience & that I thoroughly support local businesses."}
{"text":"I really tried to  find something to like about this place, but there was nothing. 1 star for the beer? Service was horrible. Food wasn't bad, but reminded me of Italian food from Dennys.  No offense to Dennys, but for the price and expectations of an upscale Italian Restaurant. ..cross this off the list."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, or at least the last time we actually ate there it was. Service has varied from o.k. to poor in the 3 or 4 times we actually ate there.  We had 7:15 reservations Friday night and at 8:00 we still weren't seated.  I won't return for the following reasons:  1. The front of the house is inept, to say the least.  Our first visit was right after they opened, and I excused the incompetence as part of the learning curve.  They haven't improved with time.  2. The noise level in the bar area makes it pointless to try to carry on a conversation. Outside is best, and the dining room in the rear has been acceptable in the past.  Bottom line - meals aren't cheap here and for your money, you can do better at a lot of other places."}
{"text":"We came here with a large group on a Sunday night after my daughter's first dance recital. They told us we would be seated in 20 minutes but it took over an hour to be seated. Already a little annoyed, we ordered an appetizer of cheese fries. Literally, these fries were at the soggiest thing that I've ever had. Have you ever left cereal in a bowl for a long period of time and then try to eat it? Yeah, exactly like that. Gross!

As for my meal, which took absolutely forever, we had a fish sandwich which wasn't bad. People in our party received their food at different times and some people's orders got screwed up. We were there so long, people in our party were discussing if they had sleeping bags in our cars in case we had to stay the night. My sister-in-law got up and left and took her kids home because it was already past their bedtime. There is just no call for being this unprepared as a restaurant. None. 

The manager came over and offered us free dessert and free appetizers for the future but quite honestly I will not be back. I already gave away my free appetizer card. What a joke of a place. 

Prediction:

     This restaurant WILL fail. If you start to develop a reputation amongst people as scatterbrained and inconsistent, people will not stand for it. There are too many other options in the area which blow this place out of the water."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood, so we are happy to see that a restaurant has sustained business for so long in this location and has very good food. We've always been a fan, but the last couple of times have been quite disappointing. The first time I noticed the service was not the same was a couple of months ago. I asked the server about an offer on Yelp, she said she would find out, and never came up with an answer. She mixed up several things we ordered and was not as knowledgable on the menu as one would expect. At first she seemed very annoyed with us, but toward the end for some reason she changed her tune and was pleasant. 

The most recent time we were disappointed actually upset a whole group of our friends. 

A smaller group met first for dinner, then later another handful of friends met everyone for drinks and to watch a basketball game. I asked what a specific drink was on the menu and neither of the bartenders knew what the drink was or what the ingredients were to it. So instead of making them flustered, I just ordered something else. 

What really set us off was this. My husband ordered a beer and when the bartender opened it she said to him \"it's warm\" and handed it to him. He said that since she already opened it he was going to drink it. A man came over to him and said not to worry that he wouldn't be charged for the next one. When my husband ordered another beer, the man charged him for it and when my husband asked about it the man replied \"well you drank the first one\". Understand, but he said said we weren't going to be charged for the next. 

Also, throughout the night there were about 20-25 people with our group. I would think that an establishment would be happy that many people were bringing money in. The bartenders seemed to be very irritated with us the whole night. Very cold, not attentive, and at some times quite rude. 

We really like the food here, but if the service continues to be this way when we go, we will find elsewhere to spend our money."}
{"text":"One of the meals I love when eating Italian is chosen from the appetizers (mussels) and salads. My choice for this restaurant was mussels in a marinara sauce and the beet and arugula salad.

I love mussels and marinara but did not care for this dish. When choosing mussels, larger are not always better, and these were the largest mussels I have ever seen. I have not been served mussels this large when eating on the coast! They were a bit chewy and when I hit one that was sandy and chewy I stopped. There was very little marinara sauce in the broth that was in the bowl so it came off as tomatoey water rather than a sauce.

The salad, on the other hand was excellent. Their basil lemon vinaigrette is wonderful. I was sopping it up with my bread.

My husband had the lasagna, his go-to when trying a new Italian restaurant, and he was not impressed. He said the meat to sauce ratio was too heavy on the meat side which left the dish a little dry but he did like the flavor of the sauce which can make or break an Italian meal. 

We took leftovers home (Hubby and son traded) and must say our son did the best when ordering. His order was the stuffed manicotti which was very good.

These were the only dishes I tasted at our table of 4 and if we do go back I will  definitely be ordering the beet salad again."}
{"text":"After reading the mixture of reviews here, I wasn't sure just what to expect. I was totally pleased with my food. I had the squash ravioli - it was superb. I also had a house salad that was nice and fresh and had just the right amounts of everything. The place was pretty noisy, but I don't think there is anything that can be done about that. All in all I have no hesitation recommending this restaurant and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Living in the area we have been to Roman Bistro a few times. Once when it first open, was not totally impressed, I gave the benefit of the doubt that it was just opening issues issues. 
We returned for a second time and we did enjoy our afternoon meal very much, service was great,  atmosphere was very good and the food was warm and prepared to my liking. 
Our last visit was sadly for a funeral luncheon. It was a very pleasant afternoon, service was great considering we took all of the back dining room area and stayed to visit with family and friends long into the afternoon. 
The buffet food was excellent! 
Highly recommended for lunch, dinner or special event. 
We will most definitely return. 
Download the app! Good information posted timely."}
{"text":"I have been to the Roman Bistro several times and haven given the restaurant the benefit of the doubt because I live in Forest Hills. Every time I go to Bistro I tell myself that it I will never return but end up going back because I have a short memory. I have written only a couple reviews in my life but I felt compelled to get this in writing so I don't forget next time someone brings up the Bistro. The food is just down right bad and the service might be worse. I give it two stars because they have a strong beer selection and the salad I had was manageable. I ordered Chicken Marsala, which was $23, and looked like it came from a frozen dinner meal. The eggplant appetizer had no evidence of eggplant and had an odd spice to it that did not fit the obviously Italian style dish."}
{"text":"Very pleasant atmosphere. Great food, service, and variety of spirits to please anyone. New Years buffet was very good. Definitely a place to bring relatives."}
{"text":"I rarely eat Italian, because if it is not homemade, it usually sucks.  I had lunch from the hot table, consisting of Vodka cream penne, breaded veal, veggies and a homemade tomato sauce.  Very tasty veal, perfectly al dente pasta, and the sauce was the real deal.  Unusual for Italian food, the portion size must have been small, since I left not stuffed to the eyebrows.

I think I need to try dinner next!"}
{"text":"I only went there once to watch a hockey game and here is what I can say about the place.  It looks very nice both inside and out.  I didn't eat anything there although the meals that came out around me were good.  I sat at the bar and when the game came on, they changed every TV in the place to the game (including the Penn St. Game that some people were watching).  There are roughly 12-15 TV in the bar area which is the front of the restaurant.  As I was there, I ordered a pumpkin beer.  Their beer selection was quite extensive.  They brought it in a small glass, which wasn't a big deal.  What was a big deal is when I found out the small glass of beer was $8.00.  I was very surprised by that because I know I can get a large 20 oz. bottle (bomber bottle) at other places for that price.  I have even paid $5-$6 for that same beer at other restaurants.  That's quite a lot for maybe a 12 oz. beer at best.  When I ordered a miller lite, it was 16oz and was only $3.00.  Much more reasonable.

I actually tried to get a reservation there on a Saturday night one time and when I called about a party of 6, they told me the only reservation they had was at 4:30.  I would definitely recommend planning long in advance if you want a larger party there.

I am actually hoping to go there another time to experience the food but will keep in mind the over priced bar menu when I go there.  The parking lot is somewhat small but about the right size because the restaurant isn't as large as it appears."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, extensive menu.
Roman burger is excellent...burger with pepperoni, sauce, and marinara.
Antipasto salad and chili were good selections as well.
I loved the Italian meat app rolled in a wonton, although a little pricey it was excellent! 
The pasta sauce was a bit sweet for my liking and pasta served starchy but was ok.
I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Dante has this place on track and the service has been great. One of the best servers ever, Corey, has a knack for making the experience special. Lots of craft brews and the Tortellacci is a great dish."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, food was great (big portions though), server was very polite and knowledgeable.  Great experience so we will be back!"}
{"text":"Partner and I came for dinner for the first time on Friday evening. We shaped all and found the minestrone soup, salmon special and pasta dishes of good portion size and exceptionally tasty. 

The grilled Calamari dish on a bed of greens was barely warm and was mostly greens and little squid which I felt was disappointing. I therefore give this place a 4/5 rating. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the steak salad, the steak was good ( a little over cooked, but good ). The salad was just too plain. You have a choice between a few different salad bases. I ordered the House salad, the last time I was there I ordered it with my meal and loved it soo I thought this time with steak it would have been amazing. Maybe the Chef was slacking tonight I dunno. I don't know what they spent on the steak for the salad but i do not understand how they came up with the price of $17. I didn't get a 17 dollar salad tonight for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent experience for lunch. Would love to come for dinner. 

A must if coming from Granview Gold Club, Kenny wood or just out and about. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My first visit here went so well that I can't even prepare myself for it to be anything less on future visits.

The location is convenient to most of my travels, but I never seemed to have the time to step inside to try it out.  

Thanks to a trip into the city for a concert, I was able to plan some extra time to stop here for a pre-concert dinner and drinks.

Our entrance into the restaurant was met with a prompt and genuine greeting by the hostess. We mentioned that this was our first visit and she welcomed us, and offered several different seating options. I was very surprised to see how large the dining areas were and that they had multiple rooms to choose from.

Once seated, a cheery server came over to greet us and informed us of the drink and dinner specials for the evening.  In addition to their great sounding specials,  we were also told that most all of their appetizer and flatbreads were half-off and  they were offering various drink promotions during happy hour.

The appetizer and flatbread menu included many wonderful selections to try at a discount.  We placed our order and while we were waiting we were given a serving of their delicious oven-warmed bread and a dipping blend of seasoned olive oil.

Our order arrived within a sufficient amount of time, and everything looked great.  Our only concern was that the portions were quite generous and we might have over-ordered and would need to pack most of it to go.  We managed to sample a little of everything and had plenty left for another meal.

Based on my first visit, Roman Bistro is a place I would visit again and again."}
{"text":"Their food was very homemade and Italian. The penne alla vodka wasn't the best I've had but still pretty good. Pasta was perfectly al dente and their lasagna was very fluffy. However, their veal parmigiana was very soggy.

The service was good and I love the decor in the restaurant. Overall a nice Italian place."}
{"text":"Had a great time here, we wanted something on the light side, we tried some flat bread pizzas. Absolutely loved everything,  so fresh, the bread and dipping oils. Service was great. Planning to go back for Death by Chocolate"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place since I will be moving to the area and I heard good things about it. 
The night that I went was during Pittsburgh Restaurant week so we decided to order off the special menu. 
I got the crab and lobster Hozel, Chilean Sea Bass with mushroom risotto and broccolini, and cream brûlée for dessert. The first course was delicious and the seafood was cooked perfectly and tender. I loved the presentation! It was served in a martini glass. The second course was good as well but there was some fatty areas on the sea bass that were not too pleasing for my palette. The worst was the dessert course. The cream brûlée was rubbery and hard it took everything I had to eat it. Worse cream brûlée I ever have eaten. 
The service was good and the decor was nice. Liked how they had the bar area upfront and quite dinning area in the back. I saw they had a piano for live music which I wouldn't mind checking out. 
Other then that disastrous dessert I am willing to give this place another try. Some of the other dishes that came out of the kitchen looked very yummy"}
{"text":"Roman Bistro was awesome. We ordered the Pasta Night specials. The sauces were delicious and the portions were huge. Our server,  Corey,  was great. He was very knowledgeable and helpful with the menu and dishes. I highly recommend Roman Bistro for a romantic dinner, business lunch, or a family outing."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, and the atmosphere is lovely, relaxed, and welcoming. Bridget was wonderful!!! She was just the right amount of attentive - anticipating our every need. She was warm and friendly and very good at her job!

Great gem of the Forest Hills area!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 7pm, took awhile for our order to be taken, got our appetizer (which was good) after not too long. At 8pm, a manager came and apologized for the wait. Food finally came at 8:15pm, with the manager again apologizing and saying dessert would be free. My plate of ravioli was overflowing with a very watery cream sauce and it took more time to flag someone down to get it fixed. When it came back, it was good. But it took longer for anyone to check on us again or see if we wanted dessert, at which point we just wanted to leave. They did take my ravioli off the check instead of the free dessert, and I appreciate that. But after waiting 75 minutes for food, it's excruciating to have to wait around to be checked on, to get the check, and for someone to finally run the check. The two hour ordeal was not worth it."}
{"text":"Been back a few more times since last review (closest restaurant to home) and they are still serving great food but the service had really stepped it up a notch. the waiters/waitress are fantastic and go out of their way to make sure your happy and they are personable. 

again, the sausage gnocchi is still my favorite. 

keep it up!"}
{"text":"My family hosted a wedding shower at Roman Bistro for me on Saturday March 29. As a first timer I was highly impressed! Prior to the party I sat at the bar with a friend and couldn't believe the all of the beer, wine, etc options. Our wait staff inside the party was so friendly, helpful, patient and attentive; we couldn't ask for better service. We had 3 choices on our party menu and guests raved at how delicious everything tasted; the food was served quickly after ordering and in a great flow with the shower activities. We were not rushed out in any way leaving ample time to visit, chat, take pictures, etc at the end of the party. I can't wait to come back under more normal circumstances and see what else the Roman Bistro has to offer!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night, Judy & the bar staff were great. The food& drink were great. Especially the ceaser salad. I will b back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  So far... my favorite is the beet salad.  I can't stop getting it!!!  I've also had the poutine, bada bing shrimp, and Italian wedding soup.  All were decent.  Bada bing shrimp was just OK.  I wouldn't order it again though.

The bar is this place's asset.  Bartenders are great!  They have an awesome beer selection here with the ever enticing mystery beer! It's not one of my go to places in the area for casual food."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant planted firmly on Ardmore, this Forest Hills Eatery was delightful inside and out. Ambiance was inviting, bar was comfortable and parking was ample. I had the pear and pecan salad with shrimp which was incredible. Warm grilled juicy shrimp were perfectly paired with the pecans and fresh pears. Gorgonzola would have been the preferred cheese to their feta, but oh well... it was wonderful. Service was questionable at best. My bartender was so caught up in other conversations, that the hostess had to come yell at her to take my order. At one point I had two oblivious bartenders staring at my empty glass of water, both failing miserably. It was pretty disappointing considering the food was so nice. Here's hoping they rectify the situation !  At least the food was worthy of 5 stars..."}
{"text":"This place is usually very busy for Sunday brunch, and for good reason. The prices are reasonable, and the selection is amazing. Bonus points to them for having Chef JR on hand to prepare a freshly made omelettes and waffles. 

Forest Hills has needed a local hang out like this for the longest time. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. 

The atmosphere is cozy, and informal. It feels like a neighborhood pub -- hard to tell it used to be an abandoned car dealership!

My only complaint is more of a constructive suggestion. They offer a bloody Mary bar, with just a few scans options to garnish. Perhaps they could make it more of a focal point and offer things like bacon and shrimp."}
{"text":"Great Valentines Day meal!! Service was on point, our server Kristy could not have been nicer, attentive and professional. The Sea Bass looked good(girlfriends meal) and I had the Lobster Ravotti which was FANTASTIC!!!!! And it's always nice when the Chef stops by!!
How can you go to a \"Chain\" restaurant when you can go to a place like this!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.. Great food.. Great specials ... So many beers to choose from.. And the half off appetizers are to die for.. And you must try of of the Chef features.. Always fresh and tasty. I would recommend this place to anyone.. Service has always been spot on.. So if your in Forrest Hills... You gotta stop.. And don't even get me started on Sunday brunch.. Soon much food"}
{"text":"What they said re service!  I was actually so angry from waiting for service from a surly bartender who insisted on correcting our nomenclature on our drink order that I almost walked out.  My Mother had wanted to bring me here so I took a deep breath and TRIED to order.  Meatball sandwich in Pittsburgh should be pretty safe, right???  Me,  \"Can I have a small salad instead of fries?\"  Surly bartender, \"No.\"  REALLY???  
Food arrives quickly ergo one star.
Food was absolutely horrible!  My mother had the blackened prime rib sandwich.  I had the meatball hoagie without salad.  Both were bland and tasteless.
The manager asked us how it was and I told her.  She credited us for the meals which was appreciated but doesn't save the poor service and bad food."}
{"text":"I have dined at Roman Bistro at least three or four times since they opened last year. The restaurant fills a much needed niche that's above the local fast food chains and diner located next door. The location is convenient to Forest Hills residences, and though often almost filled, the parking lot usually has at least a couple spaces remaining.

I personally enjoy the pizzettes. I have recently had both the Prosciutto E Arugula and Chicken & Artichoke, and both are very delicious. I also discovered last night that pizzettes are half off on Friday nights!

Roman Bistro has a nice amount of beers on tap, and I am often undecided between a couple beers. Their mixed drinks have always been tasty and worth the money. I have tried the Mango Mojito, Milky Way Martini, and Espresso Martini and would order all three drinks again.

I really like Roman Bistro and hope it's around for many years to come!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  It is the first place in the area that we have liked.  The food was great!  The service was slow on our last visit, but I just think it was our waiter.  We feel very lucky to have such a great place so close to home."}
{"text":"We had dinner reservations for 7:00 on a Saturday & were seated promptly.  The server was very attentive and the food was very good &  quite plentiful!  I had a salad with a crab cake.  And my husband had Chicken Parmesan.  I had the butternut squash ravioli in the past, which is excellent!"}
{"text":"We had the worst experience here, never ever book a party or dinner here, ever. We made a reservation for a large party to celebrate my sister graduating nursing school. I spoke to a manager and then a banquet person. Not once did they say that there was a fee for bringing a cake, not once. 

They interrupted my sister who was opening her gifts in front of my family to say that there would be a fee for bringing a cake. It was not about a fee, it was $1 per person. It was about not being told ahead of time and then being treated so rudely.

They treated me and spoke to me so disrespectfully and one man likened me bringing a cake to the party to bringing coffee to eat n park and then rolled his eyes at me. We had twenty people there, everyone ordering large meals. The way we were treated was absolutely disrespectful. It's a shame because the waiters/waitresses were sweet and delivered great service. 

In the end chris took off our fee but I can promise we will never ever come back here again and if you are thinking about planning a family get-together I would refrain from doing so at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Made reservations online but arrived a little early.  Only one other couple in the place.  Very quaint.  Was allowed to try two drafts before picking my drink.  Good selection.  Got calamari and stuffed banana peppers for an appetizer. Watch those peppers - my mouth was on fire!!! A guy came in with his little girl and they put them right near us - not a big deal but I guess they don't have a problem with someone playing videos on their phone with the volume up.  I think it's inappropriate.  Anyways - got the ravioli three ways (lobster, butternut squash, and cheese).  Husband got the knocchi.  Both came with veggies.  All prefabbed from what I could tell.  Was a little disappointed in that.  Got carrot cake to go - also prefabbed.  We'll see what thats like later.  Stay posted.  Ok, just finished eating the cake - sorry folks, less than spectacular.  :("}
{"text":"I've been to Roman Bistro several times for Happy Hour.  They have a wonderful craft beer list and their appetizers have been pretty tasty.  Never have I stopped in for dinner.  After our experience, I may just stick to Happy Hours.

We had two separate servers asking us the same questions... at different times.  Weird.  Since it seemed busy, we ordered calamari.  I've had this in the past and thought it was decent.   Tonight it was absolutely flavorless.  The only flavor was in the dipping sauce.  No tossing in lemon or even salt.   Simply dry and dead.  

Our entrées were the prime rib special and chicken artichoke picatta.  For $26 I expected more out of the prime rib.  Ordered medium/rare, it was overcooked and it just seemed lack luster.   My chicken artichoke dish comprised of overcooked pasta, bland chicken, and the inedible parts of artichoke.  Not worth the $20 ticket.  I would not recommend this dish. 

When receiving our $86 bill, my jaw dropped a bit.  This meal was worth $40-50, not $86.  

I give Roman's a 3 because I truly enjoy the bar and happy hour.  It just seems like it has a bit of an identity crisis - great beer, tvs, and bar atmosphere mixed with an overpriced, hoity toity back room.  It has Italian on the menu along with  bbq ribs, a Cuban sandwich, and coconut shrimp... those aren't even close to Italian.  It just doesn't work.

\"Do as the Roman's do\" is not the correct slogan for this venue.  Instead I'll grab a pint and leave with a smile."}
{"text":"Great service, hot delicious food, beautiful atmosphere.  I had the gnocchi with asparagus and goat cheese.  It was very tasty.  We came in on the spur of the moment near closing time and they were very happy to serve us.  There was no rush to leave. We will come back for sure."}
{"text":"You never get a second chance to make a first impression. 

Truer words have never been spoken. My family lives pretty much across the street from this establishment. For several years it stood empty. We carefully watched, hoping some restaurant would move in - preferably one that served alcohol. 

When it became clear a business was moving into the building, we were thrilled. After months of watching renovations and wondering what was to come, the Roman Bistro finally opened. On Father's Day, my husband, daughter, and I headed over to enjoy a nice family dinner at our newest local restaurant. 

I'll start with the positives. The beer list is amazing. Great selection. And the atmosphere is very attractive. As far as the food goes, it's not bad. It's nothing to write home about, but it's okay.

Here's where the critical aspects of this review kick in. After selecting our meals, including ziti for our two-year-old, we waited an inordinate amount of time for our food to arrive. Our waitress had seemingly disappeared. Empty drink glasses were not refilled. If it had been a busy night this would have been understandable. But it wasn't a busy night at all. About 2/3 of the tables sat empty. 

Finally our waitress reappeared. She brought out a basket of cold and slightly stale bread and told us our food would be out soon. Then she dropped the bombshell: there was no ziti. Our 2-year-old's meal would not arrive with our meals. If you have a young child, you understand that can be a major issue. We asked for a mini pizza instead but the mini pizza would not be ready for about 20 minutes. Not good.

Our meals came out and as I fruitlessly tried to get my daughter to eat some of my trout with shallots (best of luck getting a toddler to eat that), I lamented not going to the more casual but consistently decent Drew's down the block. 

Her pizza finally arrived about 15 minutes later. She enjoyed the pizza but it was too little, too late. 

We left feeling shortchanged, having spent a good $75 with tip for a below-average experience. On our way out, we stopped in at the beer store to get a sampler - a six-pack for $33. The beer was fantastic and the prices probably reflect PA's archaic liquor laws more than anything else. But we were feeling none too jazzed about stopping in for another meal anytime soon. 

Final verdict: We've been back for the occasional beer but never another meal. Maybe that's a mistake. But first impressions are everything and our first impression of the Roman Bistro left us decidedly unimpressed."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time on Valentine's Day. I began my meal with a cup (which was a small bowl) of wedding soup. It was flavorful, delicious full of vegetables and chicken! I also had the huge chicken parmigiana sandwich with sweet potato fries. The only thing missing from both was some more seasoning. Our waiter (I can't remember his name, he was young & Asian) was very attentive and polite. He made my day by giving me a red rose! I'll visit again!"}
{"text":"Love Roman Bistro! Hubby and I went for dinner last night. Reservations were at 6:15 but we arrived before 6 pm and were promptly seated. We took advantage of the half-off deal on some appetizers (offered before 6 pm) and ordered the bada bing shrimp. They were very tasty in a tangy sauce, plump and plentiful! I ordered the beet salad with lemon vinaigrette dressing. Delish! Warm bread with dipping oil accompanied the meal. Hubby ordered the short ribs and I ordered the lobster ravioli. Awhile later, the manager announced they were out of short ribs. Not wanting a further dinner delay, my husband ordered the ravioli as well. We loved the dish, always a favorite! We ordered the lemon cake for dessert. It was very flavorful, served with warm chocolate sauce and a dollop of whipped cream aside. Service was excellent, but was disappointed with the timeliness to mention the unavailability of short ribs. This popular gem is our frequent go-to place and they also are very accommodating to large groups as we have reserved for parties of 12-15 on several occasions. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our service at the Roman bistro from Judy was phenomenal! She was attentive to our needs, fulfilled all of our requests and even told us about some specials that we were unaware of. Food selections were extensive,  along with the wine and beer list. We had a great evening here"}
{"text":"It's Classy-n'nat!

Love this place - great people work here and I even like the owner! I was in town to visit family and it is so nice to have a good place to go close by without driving too far. It's a safe area - a nice parking lot fully lit and has great ambience! 

Outside seating is available and it's done well. 

I came by with my brother several times during the 2 weeks I was there. I like good beer and the local bars are mostly big brand beers like Bud and Coors types. This place must have 35 beer taps of really outstanding brews. The wine list is decent. Great bartenders - there's one guy Mr. Jacob that was well educated in all of the ales and food preparations they carry and delivered it with style. It worked out that we knew his parents - small world. I went to Catholic school with his mother - awesome family. 

Later that week my whole family ate there for my Dad's 80th birthday. Everyone enjoyed their food, service was excellent and the wine we chose was delicious and was reasonably priced. 

This is where the big wigs of Forest Hills go like Hal C. - the big deals are being made at the bar, the wheelers and dealers. 

This is a true neighborhood gem that is well respected in Forest Hills!"}
{"text":"I have been by this place many times, thought I'd give it a try for lunch on the way to work. I was a little hesitant because of the 3 star rating.

Now I can't judge the service for big groups,  that seems to be the cause of their negative reviews. But Judging their lunch, I  was very impressed.  

I tried the turkey panini and it was fantastic, as were the sweet potato fries. In fact, one of the best sandwiches I have had in a long time.

Browsing their menu, most of it looks really good. I'll for sure be back to explore it in more detail."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried the Roman Bistro after friends recommended it. We went with another couple and were VERY disappointed  my husband and I ordered the strip steak. TOUGH.  Portions were small.  We waited one hour and 10 minutes until we were served our meal with no explanation.  Prices were high for the quality of food."}
{"text":"After going to Roman Bistro, I was waiting for Gordon Ramsay to come out and say they were filming an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.  Never before have I seen such a poorly run restaurant.

When we arrived, the dining room area wasn't full, yet it took them over 15 minutes to seat us and there was no explanation.  That should have been a sign to run for the door but we soldiered on.  After they did seat us, the unbelievably unfriendly waitress decided she'd actually come over and ask us if we wanted something to drink.  It was as if we had inconvenienced her with our presence.  

The Caesar salad tasted like it had no dressing and anchovies while the cheese was so mild you could barely taste it.  The gazpacho was nice and refreshing on a hot day.  The night we were there, it was thundering outside and I was wishing for a power outage so our entrees wouldn't actually come.  Sadly though, my prayers were not answered so the nightmare meal continued.  The lobster ravioli tasted of cream cheese and were swimming in a mess of olive oil and diced tomatoes.  The crab cakes were not made of lump meat but of a little bit of backfin meat and a whole lot of overly salted filler.  The bison burger was heavily charred and came out at the wrong temperature.  To make matters worse, the \"fried onion\" pieces they put on top were soggy and reminded me of a pile of mucus.  But I dare not complain and ask the waitress who had a stick up her rear to take it back because I didn't want to deal with her attitude.  And who knows, the second time, the burger might actually have mucus on it.  The best thing we had was the beet salad, because it never arrived (although they tried to bill us for it).

I think our biggest mistake was not ordering lots of alcohol so we'd be drunk and wouldn't realize what on earth we were eating and how bad the service actually was.  It looked like everyone else was happy and having a jolly good, drunken time.  Especially the table of 4 next to us that magically ballooned to a party of 6 when they sat down on the bench and effectively joined our table too.

All in all, I certainly will never step foot in here again, even though I'd like to sample some of the beers they have on tap in their impressive selection."}
{"text":"Some girlfriends and I ventured out to Forest Hills to try out Roman Bistro. I was surprised to find it was less formal than I had envisioned. We had a roomy booth in the corner of the restaurant. The atmosphere was nice- not too loud or dark. Our waitress was fantastic. She could tell we had a sense of humor and wasn't afraid to bring that to the table and keep things entertaining. I got two peach Moscow mules, their special for the evening, which ran me $9 each. We all ordered appetizers to share and there were plenty to go around. I got a flatbread pizzette for my entree and it did not disappoint. 
The one weird thing was they charged my friend $5 extra per glass of scotch to put it on ice. We asked and the waitress took it off, but just watch out. 

Overall, delicious food and great service! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Prices were very high and food was okay. I feel like I could have replicated the dishes at home. But wasn't too bad overall"}
{"text":"The staff here is always so friendly and helpful! Plus the food is amazing! The Bada-bing shrimp is so so good!"}
{"text":"As much as I like to patronize local establishments and small business in general, Roman is more style than substance.  Food portions are small, beer is overpriced and the service is hit-or-miss. Maybe it's just me being a young guy but as far as getting what you pay for,  there is better quality and value to be had."}
{"text":"Roman Bistro is where we started our annual Christmas outing.  Two couples, one truck and a very merry day that began with a delicious mimosa in the beautifully welcoming Brunch.

The Brunch is to the right and seating to the left.  There's a waffle and egg stationed, manned by a happy professional.

Sort of a lox and bagel area. Mini bagels were not good, very hard and unable to toast. The salmon was very tasty, but overall the station didn't quite work. 

The hot foods were rather spectacular:  everything from pierogies to savory potatoes to moist meats.

Desserts were good.

Service was outstanding - we will definitely go back"}
{"text":"We went here for a father's day brunch. Hands down some of the best buffet food I've had in a long time. Located on the corner at the light just after Drew's family restaurant.

They had smoked ham, baked beans, corn, cheesy eggs, French toast, waffles, sausages, fruit, salad...the works. They even had an omelette and waffle station. My compliments to the chef working the omelette station. It was the best omelette I've had in a long time. Full of flavor, probably because the butter but everything was cooked to perfection. Everything was satisfying, even the service was very welcoming. 

I would definitely visit again to try some of their normal dishes. Hope they are as good as brunch."}
{"text":"We heard about this place a few weeks ago and decided to gather with some friends there tonight for dinner and drinks.  We were pleased to see they have an extensive menu that includes just about any Italian dish you could ever want.  There's a great roomy bar with over 30 beers on tap!  I had veal parm and it was absolutely delicious!  Everyone at the table commented how good their food was and that the portions were enormous.  The staff was very friendly and engaging.  The hostess, Tammy, was particularly accommodating when we arrived a little earlier than the rest of the crew.  It was a nice personal touch when Justin, the chef, visited our table to check how our meals were.  Our server, Kenya, did a great job making sure we were taken care of.  She had a nice friendly approach.  All in all, we had a great night out with awesome friends and enjoyed some really good food.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We've eaten there 3 times over the past year.  The food is pretty good but the service is usually slow and it's not cheap.  At our previous visit we waited quite a while for a server, and then two servers alternately waited on us for the evening, and it took forever.  We went back tonight but left without eating.  We arrived for our 6:30 reservation on time.  The hostess sat us immediately, then went to get us silverware.  For the next 15 minutes, five different servers walked back and forth past our table without anyone taking our orders, while other customers who arrived after us had water brought and their orders taken.  Not one of the five servers stopped to ask if anyone had taken our order.  The hostess also walked past without asking if someone had helped us.  We asked to see the manager on the way out.  She apologized but rather than offering a free drink or appetizer, she simply offered to have our orders taken immediately.  We politely declined and left, and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"SUCCULENT
Moist and tasty :  TOOTHSOME

A friend of mine was recently in town due to the passing of his father.  As with a lot of situations in life, sharing a good meal with friends and loved ones can help carry us away from our own personal grief filled moments.  Our visit to Roman Bistro was one of those moments where we could set aside the reason for the return home and build new memories to cherish in the future.

There are several dining spaces at the Roman Bistro and a main entry with a white baby grand piano.  Comfortable, cozy and welcoming all the way around.  We were quickly seated and our server could not have been more pleasant.  Additionally, throughout our meal the restaurant manager and server checked to make sure that we were content and not in need of anything.

During the fall and winter months, I enjoy warm and comforting food.  Thick stews, hearty soups and roasted meats.  Stick to your rib fare, for sure, but also food that feels like a warm hug.  I ordered the pork osso bucco served with garlic polenta and sautéed broccoli with roasted tomatoes.  My friend ordered the chicken artichoke piccata with linguini and my daughter Muff ordered the white bruschetta pizza.  Each meal was different yet the same with its comforting aspects.

The osso bucco, usually made from veal shanks but in this case with a pork shank, was tender and succulent.  I don't know how they achieved the somewhat crispy roasted outside and moist inside... Truly, all I had to do was nudge the meat with my fork and it came away from the bone.  The demi-glace sauce and side dishes were also impeccable.

I usually don't order any type of piccata dishes in restaurants simply because the chefs seem to go overboard with the tart aspects of this style of dish.  This dish was well executed with just the right amount of acidulousness from the lemon and capers and balanced with the right amount of butter.  My daughter's white bruschetta pizza was brightened with a porcini glaze that cut through the richness of the pizza.

We each sampled food from one another's plates and thoroughly enjoyed the nourishment for our bodies and souls during the time that we spent with one another.  Roman Bistro invites these types of moments through their food, impeccable service and ambiance.  If you're in the area  or just need a food hug, fare una visita al Roman Bistro."}
{"text":"I really would love to rate this place higher and I would have had I not ordered take out from here on 3/1/16 and received it in the containers that I brought to the restaurant on 2/20/16 for my baby shower. I recognized the containers because they had a sticker on them. The sticker had been ripped off, but not completely for my take out order. The leftover containers had been placed next to my gifts and were clearly intended for me to take back home NOT be used by the restaurant for their future take out orders. 

In addition to my stolen containers, which by the way can not be okay with the health board, the cookies and chocolate on top of my cake weren't given to me. They were either tossed out or kept by the staff. My cake was originally cut by someone from the restaurant but after that the guests had to cut their own cake.  The restaurant charges $1 per person to cut the cake but didn't cut the cake. My mother-in-law had cake in one of the to go containers next to her on the table. When it disappeared she asked a waitress if they had seen it. The waitress told her she would check but when walking past my Aunt stated \"I didn't steal her cake.\"  

There were also several pieces of cake left after the shower that mysteriously disappeared after the guests left. 

I am disappointed in this place. We've been here for dinner and have had various larger dinner parties here. I will no longer visit this establishment and will not recommend it to anyone else"}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once for lunch and once for dinner. Overall...it's really good...and I'm not easy to please.
Lunch was with some buddies after a round of golf. I had a big ol' burger that wa s done right and generously smothered with onions, nushrooms and blue cheese. Delicious...and the variations that my buddies ordered were all met with hearty approval.
Dinner the other night was with two kids and a mom...I ordered a pasta dish from their pasta night options. My boy had spaghetti and the others split some wings and fries. The waitress was attentive, the food was great, and the cost wax much less that I'd have thought. Nice touch was the free dessert for the birthday mom after a play at spin the wheel. 
I have to admit, I came in with some preconceived notions - figured this place was an overpriced attempt at high class in a middle class neighborhood. Turned out it's an excellent restaurant that gets it right. Well done!"}
{"text":"We had the wolf fish cioppino special. Loaded with clams, mussels, shrimp, fish and fish over fusili. It was cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"The desserts are delicious - it's hard to name the desserts on the Brunch bar because it's a decadent display of so many treats. Labels would be helpful on the lesser known desserts. 
From petit pettifors in chocolate, to cannoli, chocolate and rice puddings, apple pie, and even a good old fashioned dirt dish complete with candy worms. The presentation is great (whoever sets it up has an eye for creating appetites)!
If my husband leaves it up to me, I'm choosing Roman Bistro every time!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a double date here for brunch today. We were seated within two minutes outdoors as requested since there was a nice breeze out (despite the 90F weather). We did the $17/person brunch buffet which ends at 2pm. Their variety is good; you can find pretty much every brunch food staple and more. I had eggs, sausage, potato latkes, pancakes, cheesy potatoes, and a blueberry waffle. I wanted to try a lot more but sadly was too full after one plate and half a waffle. They also have salmon, veggies, and sweets (cupcakes, donuts, cookies, jello, cake pops, etc.) and an omelette and waffle bar where a friendly man will make you whatever you like. Mixed opinion on the food. I really enjoyed the potato latkes and my blueberry waffle, but the sausage was too fatty, the eggs tasted old, the pancake was stale, and the potatoes were way too cheesy. If I come back, I'll probably only get the potato latkes, a waffle, try an omelette, and skip most of the other food.

{"text":"We have gone in for drinks four times. Each time was worse than the last. Bartenders surly and rude every time. Customers should not have to try to engage the help - it should be the help making customers feel welcome. Asked for the beer glass to be full on one occasion and was told \"that's how we pour\". That's okay, we get it. Other establishments want our business.  Sad that yours doesn't."}
{"text":"Average. My girlfriend ordered the dinner special that was available that evening only to find out 5 minutes later from the waitress that they had run out of the special. Kind of discouraging. I also had to wait several minutes for a drink refill which is a pet peeve of mine. If I am at a restaurant, paying for a dinner experience, don't make me wait for more water. The food was not prepared as ordered- salmon was cooked less than I asked for. Food was average and overpriced. Wasn't impressed and will pass the next time someone asked if I'd like to go to dinner there."}
{"text":"We met at the bar for drinks before dinner.  The beer selection was adequate and the cosmo was acceptable.  The martini menu lists all sorts of creations, many of which are served dirty.  The basic martini that I had was weaker than I expected.  My Bistro Burger with sweet potato fries was medium rare, as ordered.  The server was attentive and efficient.  Roman Bistro seems as if it could fill a niche on Ardmore Blvd in Forest Hills."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a wonderful hostess. We had reservations and we were immediately seated. The dining room was huge. I believe there are a few different rooms and a big bar area. We were seated and I immediately noticed how chilly it was. We were waited on quickly by our waitress. She was nice. Although when I checked in on my Yelp app, I unlocked  dollar off a beverage coupon. She went and got the manager who seemed very confused saying she had never seen this before. But it is your offer? Anywho, we ordered drinks. The martinis were very good but very small. And they do have a huge selection of beer. So, we ordered a pretzel to start. It was huge and good. Nice app to share at the table. I ordered the Parma  chicken aka chicken parmesan minus the mushrooms. It was good. The gnocchi was really good! The chicken was a little overdone but not bad. The hubby ordered the gnocchi and sausage and enjoyed it immensely. Our friend ordered the butternut squash ravioli and enjoyed it saying it was very good. Our other friend offered the lasagna. First it didn't come out with the other three dinners and when it did and he got into the middle it was stone cold. He sent it back, not 5 minutes later it was back. The outside was hot the inside was still stone cold. Two different managers came to apologize. They asked if he would like a different meal and he went with the gnocchi and sausage. They offered him a free beer and he declined. They offered him a free dessert which he also declined. The portions here a huge. When they got the bill the only thing that wasn't on there was the lasagna, well it was on there and taken off. They even charged him for the beer he did have?! What? He couldn't even eat with us. They brought the beer up to our waitress and she reluctantly took it off their bill saying she had not been aware he was offered a free beer. Ummm then why were we visited by two different managers. And if you offer a free dessert and he chose not to take that, take the cost off a dessert off the bill. It was not the greatest customer service experience I have ever seen to say the least. And just a side note, the portions are big but you pay for them. Our bill which included two martinis, a beer (glass sizes  are small here), an app, and two dinners came to $86 not including tip."}
{"text":"We had a bad experience at the Roman Bistro.  We arrived around 6 pm on a Sunday night.  We were told the wait was around 20-30 minutes.  No problem, had a drink at the bar.  

We were seated an hour and 20 minutes later.  We ordered drinks at the table.  Mine came about 10 minutes after the rest of our party's after which I also had to remind the waitress that I did not recieve a drink.  We ordered appetizers.  My brother and sister in law ordered cheese fries that tasted like they were right from the microwave.  

Our food came about 45-50 minutes after we ordered.  I ordered the chicken panini.  It tasted alot like frozen chicken.  I ordered sweet potato fries-regular fries were brought out.  

The manager did offer us desert on the house or appetizers the next time we came.  I'm not interested in appetizers next time, because I wont be back."}
{"text":"Overtly discriminated against here. No service for a full 20 minutes while a man and woman came in, sat next to us, and were serviced immediately. Rude staff when I brought it to their attention. Food has always been just so-so, and service has always been iffy, but this is the final straw. Now they are discriminating against customers. Done with this place. Oh - and a plate of grouper (one of the most common fish in the world)....$31. #overpriced #overrated #overit"}
{"text":"While we were happy to finally have what looked like a decent place in Forest Hills, we were skeptical about whether the new restaurant would compare to alternatives in Shadyside et al.  We were not disappointed.

The pork osso bucco is amazing, first of all.  It's both delicious (one of those meat dishes that's been cooked on the bone in some kind of savory sauce for a long time) and impressively presented.  We also had the calamari for an appetizer, which was not overcooked, too salty, or too greasy as fried calamari often can be.  I also thought the basil dipping sauce was something new.  The tiramisu looked amazing, but we were too full to try it - next time!  It was nice to see that they have a gluten free menu for friends with dietary concerns, or for the days when we're trying to be healthy :)

The beer and wine selection are both great with a wide range of prices and international selection.  

The atmosphere is pleasant.  It's festive but not too loud, the tables aren't too close together, they have a number of TVs with sports around, and you can see the wine cave.  There's also a white grand piano near the entrance, haha.  We sat inside, but the patio looks nice.  We walked, but it looks like parking is easy enough.

The waitstaff needs further refining, but we expected that given that the place is new.  We could at least see that they were very eager to please and fix any errors."}
{"text":"I was tired and hungry. Long day at work. Bridget came with amazing recommendations. Home run!!! Now tired but belly full."}
{"text":"Ive ordered their lasagna trays for family events and parties. Excellent homemade pasta and sauce. Costly, but it is a lot of work.
Friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had dinner there for my anniversary the other night.  The food was delicious, the service was great, and the portions were generous.

They are a bit pricey, but they do have Groupons available,"}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch. A really good value for the selection offered. Be causious of the after church croud around 1230. They fill the place up and are generally really slow in the buffet line. The staff are really friendly and I have yet to have a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Roman Bistro has a very nice building and is a great environment to enjoy drinks and dinner.  However, they seem to still be going through the struggles of a brand new business.  Their staff seems to be out of sync.  Their bartenders are not very knowledgeable which makes me believe that they were friends of or related to the owners.  

The Kitchen on the other hand is pretty phenomenal! I ordered a \"cigar\" flatbread and it was amazing! (half priced during happy hour) I have not tried the rest of the menu, but it is pretty unique for the area (forest hills) and rather gourmet compared to area restaurants.  

I recommend Roman Bistro, I only suggest waiting 6 months from now for them to work out their staff issues."}
{"text":"Roman Bistro is a welcome addition to Ardmore Blvd. I am happy to see more small businesses and coffee shops opening in Forest Hills.  

I am conflicted about writing RB's review because each time that I have gone, I have had a completely different dining experience.  As a result, I'm giving it a \"middle of the road\" three stars.  Here's a brief summation of my trips.  They can be broken down to four types. 

CASUAL PENS GAME
RB has several game-day specials like half price wings (5$ for a half dozen jumbo wings and bread), $2 Miller Lights (meh.), and select discounts on drafts/wine.  Their wings are really good and huge to boot. RB has 33 drafts and more in their bottle shop.  Definitely a fun place to catch the game, but I've gotten a listless vibe from the bartenders on more than one occasion.

ROMANTIC-TYPE DINNER WITH BOYFRIEND
Boyfriend and I used a coupon for a nice dinner one Friday evening.  Our waiter (this time) was very friendly, if slightly overwhelmed by the demands of his many tables.  For an appetizer, we ordered the Antipasto Plate with 'artisan cheeses and meats.\"  This couldn't be farther from the truth.  It looked and tasted like someone dumped their Giant Eagle deli selections on a plate.  Avoid.  The calamari with aioli was really delicious, however.  We also shared a bottle of red wine from their extensive wine list.  For entrees, I chose the lobster ravioli and boyfriend had the seafood special of they day.  We both enjoyed our meals but 1. they took a long time to get to us.  We were thinking of complaining when they finally arrived.  2. entrees are a la carte and I think for the price soup and/or salad would be appropriate inclusions. 

BOTTLE SHOP
I've frequented their bottle shop for beers as it's a convenient walk from where I live.  The prices are very reasonable (a bit cheaper than D's), but sometimes I stood at the bar forever until someone helped me with my purchase.  

BRUNCH
Only been once but aside from a few a la carte options, they also have an all you can eat brunch. A really tasty Sunday treat! 

I go here often enough that I will amend my rating if the waitstaff becomes more consistent. Overall, service is really polar.  Roman Bistro has some fantastic staff who are friendly and knowledgeable.  But some of the others remind me of disaffected youth forced to do community service after committing a minor crime. I will be happy to give this place four stars after a few more positive dining experiences!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Roman Bistro numerous time since it has opened.  We also live within walking distance which makes it easy to visit!  We visited opening night and had an enjoyable meal.  We have visited on several other times, especially for the live music they have at night.  They have a huge list of beers on tap!
    Most recently I have dined twice for their Sunday brunch.  I highly recommend it!  They have a chef making omelets, waffles, and pancakes.  They have fresh eggs, eggs with veggies, delicious bacon and sausage, blintzes, and potatoes.  In addition they have some lunch options like fish, chichen, and linguini.  In addition to all that they also have a dessert bar and a bloody mary station.  Brunch only costs $13 which is a fantastic price for what you get.  Not the best food ever, but far from the worst.
  All in all, good food and great atmosphere will keep us coming back to Roman Bistro!  

     On a side note, the commercial they have durings the Pens games are very cheesy and low quality.  They can probably improve their image by re-filming with higher quality cameras!

Latest visit May 5, after the marathon."}
{"text":"I have been to Roman Bistro a few times and I'm on their email list. Here are the things I have to say. 

Pros
1. It's called Roman Bistro 33...why 33 because the have 33 beers on tap. Yeah that's 33 more beers than any other Bar in Forest Hills because there are literally no other bars in Forest Hills. Having said that 33 is a pretty good number for any bar. 

2. Live music at least once a week. I like live music no matter what it is. Beats Muzak playing in the background. 

3.Deals every day of the week, get on their mailing list and you can stay up to date. 

4. Flat Breads yummmy........

Cons

1. The Cigar/Bottle Shop next door is weak. If I wanted to pay $5 for a cheap beer I would go to a bar in downtown. The cafe bottle shops at Giant Eagle beat the crap out of their bottle shop.

Conclusion
It's a great place especially for being in Forest Hills. Give a try and I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was our 4th time having dinner. Food was excellent but what made it so enjoyable was our server, Maurice. He us by far the best server I have ever had in over 45 years . He was exactly what s server should be. He was fantastic, very enjoyable. Use him to train your staff and I hope we can have him next time we visit.  4 stars for the restaurant and 5 stars++ for Maurice.  Please make sure you let him know ."}
