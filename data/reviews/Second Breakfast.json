{"text":"After 36+ years of stuffing food into my mouth (and a lot of it at that) I'm hardly ever surprised any more by \"good food\" but yeah, no, the food at Second Breakfast will stun you, it will awaken you, it will make you stop shoveling food into your stomach and convince you that you've found something to savor and to chew on for a little bit. The crepes, the waffles, the DUCK BACON!!!! Forget regular bacon, you don't need it, from now on you'll see pigs only as pets because the duck bacon is just that amazing. 

If there was one thing, any little thing to be critical of it's the very cool but not easy to use wooden flatware but the answer to that is to bring you own because a wooden fork should not stand in your way when it comes to this amazing and glorious food that will change your life in ways you can't even imagine.

UPDATE: The cool but not easy to use wooden flatware are gone replaced by compostable plastic-like flatware."}
{"text":"I finally got to check out second breakfast as part of an event at the mattress factory today. I'm hoping it was just an off day for them, as our meal was fairly disappointing. By far the worst part was waiting about 20 minutes to order and another 45 for our food. They were also out of a few things (like bacon!! ) which is understandable but disappointing. The volume of customers didn't seem very high for how long it took, so I'm not really sure what was going on. All that being said, the waffles were pretty good and my eggs were cooked perfectly. I also really enjoyed the hash brown. The braised chicken for the chicken and waffles was a bit bland and left a lot to be desired. Again, I hope this truck was just having an off day as it seems like a great concept. In the end we wished we would have just eaten at the cafe at the MF."}
{"text":"I've had second breakfast a lot since my first review. It's absolutely amazing! My go to is the breakfast sandwich! Simplicity = happiness. Bacon and 2 eggs served side side up on an amazing local bun. The duck fat fried hash brown is delicious as well :)"}
{"text":"The Duck bacon is amazing!! Tastiness to the max. Fresh and local ingredients. You need to check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Too little quantity of ordinary tasting food. Neither fills your heart nor your stomach."}
{"text":"These are not everyday waffles, they are outrageously delicious and wonderful. The chef has a lot of passion for preparing top quality food made from locally sourced ingredients. 

You have to try the duck bacon, it's excellent. 

You will be delighted by what you experience, everything is thoughtfully and skillfully prepared.

One of the great things about eating here is all the other things that are going on at the Public Market.  For example, I dropped in Saturday and they had live music, an old time jam session that was lots of fun.  There's also the opportunity to shop at all the other vendors."}
{"text":"So when we went on a Saturday morning, just after they'd opened, they were out of crepes, duck fat, and several other items we had hoped to order. That said, the waffle was chewy, moderately sweet and delicious with maple syrup. My breakfast buddy and I shared some soft eggs and duck bacon, which were INCREDIBLE. Like, you should go right away and get some! Like right now! 

I took away a star because they were out of half the things we wanted, and because we had to wait 30 minutes to get our order...but man, SO good. I'll be back, and soon! Also, try out the juice company next door - the pineapple green juice was delicious and not-too-sweet, not-too-green tasting. A perfect breakfast combo."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I was expecting a lot because of the stellar reviews. I found the waffle very dry, and the hash Browns too greasy. The duck Bacon was delicious."}
{"text":"No joke, one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. The duck bacon was out of this world the sweet, salty, fatty taste was perfect. The hash brown cooked in the duck fat was great with the two perfectly cooked eggs over medium. I will try to stop by every time I am in Pittsburg can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This morning I was at PPM visiting a friend working the kombucha stand (check out Red Star) when I decided to grab some breakfast. Second breakfast is open all day which is great because I forgot to eat when I woke up and breakfast food is the only food that anyone truly needs, right? I had the special which was a ham, parsnip, cheese and spinach crepe. I don't remember what kind of cheese was in the crepe but it was creamy and delicious. The crepe was perfectly thin and beautiful. They also did not skimp on the ham. The food was good, fresh and fast."}
{"text":"This place is no longer in the Pittsburgh Public Market.  I understand they now operate a food truck."}
{"text":"I have always been wanting to try this place and finally got my opportunity. Thom the owner was very friendly and allowed me to sample some of the food. He explained to me how the food is prepared and i was very intrigued!  i never thought I would like duck bacon but it is really good!!!

I also got to sample a part of a Belgium waffle topped with chocolate and blueberry sauce.

All the food here is organic and very healthy!

I decided to try a little something different by ordering the Tamagochi Japanese omelet. It is made with 3 eggs and he told me it would not be as filling as a traditional omelet. He was right!! I really enjoyed this omelet. Utensils are wooden but that did not pose a problem for me.

Prices are very reasonable and of course they offer free Wi-Fi. 

There is seating in the back so you don't have to walk around with your food.

Next time I return I plan to order complete versions of the other items I sampled. Second Breakfast is located inside the Pittsburgh public market. Off street parking is available and there is garage parking nearby."}
{"text":"I had not heard of Second Breakfast, but I was pleasantly surprised to find their food truck at Saturday's Brookline Breeze festival on the boulevard.  The menu looked great and I have always been a sucker for a good waffle.  The toppings ranged from traditional maple syrup to those appropriate to satisfy a dessert lovers sweet tooth.  They showed a peach and ginger topping, two of my favorite flavors but had sold out.  So, I decided on the bacon-brandy-maple syrup.  It was a great choice!  The syrup topping enhanced the waffle without taking anything from that crispy on the outside but moist and fluffy on the inside waffle.  Another patron had ordered ahead of me and his order of a fried egg and bacon with potatoes fried in duck fat smelled delicious!  Wanting another opportunity to try more from the menu led me here to search for a schedule for their truck.  Unfortunately, the website still shows the restaurant that was (from a comment by another reviewer) in the Pittsburgh Public Market and nothing about their switch to a food truck.  I will keep searching for more info, but hope that someone who knows will post new info here or let the owners know they need to update."}
