{"text":"Great food and wonderful people.  The gluten free selection is terrific, the meals are fantastic and the desserts are delicious.  

The atmosphere is very family friendly, with live music on Friday nights and Saturday afternoons. 

Cornerstone has a great selection of teas, and their cappuccino is really good.  

It is one of my (and my wife's) favorite places to go."}
{"text":"A wonderful little oasis away from the world. The salads are delicate and delish. Had a mini nutella cheesecake with my latte and it was tasty! Nice gluten free choices if you wish. And the owner is very personable."}
{"text":"Nice place. Very cozy. The coffee was good, not over roasted and bitter like Starbucks. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Despite the competition from a close by Starbucks & Tim Hortons, cornerstone produces superb rich coffee & a cool selection of loose leaf teas- their mint concoction is to die for. On top of that Sylvia makes a delicious pan of treats every few days and they are purely divine. Especially the salted toffee bar!"}
{"text":"Drinks are fantastic and baked goods are too !!
Washrooms are clean and service is friendly. I'm a fan

Check it out."}
{"text":"Delicious drinks and baked goods! Highly recommend! Teeny tiny, offers music lessons and has a great ambience! Will go again!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of local businesses supporting other local business and that's what Cornerstone Music does! Naturally this also gives them a super fresh and delicious menu. Love, love, LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"This super cute coffee shop is AMAZING. Most things are gluten-free and not only do they taste like \"regular\" but the pricea aren't gluten-free either. Ive been a few times and everything I've eaten has been delish. The Mayan hot chocolate is to die for. Next time I go, it's going to be for the music and dinner. They also have a huge selection of take home meals! The staff is just as wonderful as the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I've been here a few more times and had a chance to try out their breakfast menu. The Good Morning Quinoa bowl was worth waiting for, and I'm not even a sweet breakfast type of person. They accommodated my request for almond milk in the Quinoa bowl with an \"of course,\" and made me the best Americano I've had in a long time.

It's quiet and intimate here, everyone seems to know each other and the lady making my breakfast was super friendly. Aside from the Good Morning Bowl, they also have a ton of locally sourced items on their menu, the majority of them being gluten-free. They also have Shaw Open Wi-Fi, which may not work out if you're not on Shaw (but if we're homies I could spare you a free Shaw email address so you can access it). 

Wish I had the time on a Saturday to come check out the live music they have from 3:30 to closing!"}
{"text":"Oh. The chocolate cheese cake!  Beat so many I had.  A most try. But keep one piece for me! 

Coffee is what you expect from an independent: Above average. Tasty and fresh!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. It is locally sourced and own by a local Calgarian. 
They have many gluten free and vegan options. As well, they love to give back to charity such as participating every February in the YYC Hot Chocolate Fest and creating a delicious hot chocolate for that and deleting some of the proceeds from this hot chocolate to the \"Calgary Meals on Wheels\". 
the husband and wife that owns this shop are also locals in the community that it is owned and they are so friendly. They offer music lessons by the husband and the wife, Sylvia, is the front face of the shop. They recently started offering take home options as well such as soups of casseroles. Some people think it is overpriced, however, I do not as I mentioned before it is all locally sourced and everything has a lot of time and effort put into it so it is worth the price. 
They have local musicians in all the time as well."}
{"text":"A long long time ago Cornerstone was just a music store. Imagine my surprise when I was in the area and saw that it was a cafe as well! I was thrilled. I had a cookie and a chai latte, and believe me, both were superb. The staff was super friendly, and they still offer music lessons.

I recommend checking it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Loving the vibe here. Live music, local ingredients, everything is made from scratch and it's got a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My friend K is obsessed with hot chocolate. Obsessed and picky. She stumbled upon a best place to grab a hot chocolate list (there's even an annual Calgary Hot Chocolate Festival in February that looks worthy of checking out) and Cornerstone's mayan cocoa made the cut as the best. So obviously, we had to check it out.

We came on a slightly dreary Saturday afternoon, excited to warm up and try out their drinks. The place is quaint and has a nostalgic vibe, bringing me back to my piano lesson days. Cool that there's a couple rooms in the back to take piano and drum lessons! They even have a cool little arcade game and some terrible board game to entertain you while you wait (Monopoly, backgammon, etc.).The cafe itself is small with only a couple tables (maybe for 20 people) and has both drinks and food on the menu. The food itself didn't look that appealing (they had some out on display but I've read some reviews saying it's good) but we were only there to try out their drinks. The selection is small wit a couple types of coffee, chai latte and hot cocoa. 

- Hot mayan cocoa ($4.50) and chai tea latte ($4.25) - K ordered the hot mayan cocoa as she's been obessing over this type of drink ever since I ordered it in Vancouver at Schokolade Cafe. Life changing apparently. Cornerstone version is cocoa so if you're a hot chocolate purist, this may not live up to your standards. She ended up having to order a 12 oz (options of 8 oz, 12 oz or 16 oz ) as the barista only had enough mixture left to make that amount. In a nutshell, it was okay but we were expecting/hoping for more given that they had one the best hot chocolate award in 2014. To be different, I decided to try out their chai tea latte, which I believe they siphoned. It smelled great but taste wise, it didn't taste anything like a chai latte. I kept on drinking hoping the flavour would blend together but nada. At least the cups were cute?

Cool that they have live music on Friday evenings (7pm) and Saturday afternoons (3:30pm). Check out their website if you're planning to stop by for music as it's not every week. Wish there had been some music playing while we were there but guess Halloween isn't the best day to go! I like the concept but their drinks definitely need improvement for me to want to come back again."}
{"text":"I went to try the hot chocolate which was WINNER of the BEST HOT CHOCOLATE for 2014's Hot Chocolate festival - it was delicious. You can tell they take the time to use real chocolate. The cafe itself it cute and small, but offers music lessons which is a nifty perk. I believe it was the owner I met (Sylvia) who was warm and friendly and also due in 2 days!!! 
It was a nice spot, I would go back, they serve food which looks and smells delicious, and  you get a perk when you check in!!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in town! Every cup is made drip fresh in front of you. Great intimate local spot,"}
{"text":"I discovered this little coffee shop a couple of years ago when I needed a local hangout serving delicious beans in the south as an alternative to the S-word whenever friends and clients wanted to meet for coffee.

It's still a great place to go for my Americano (which I cannot order without also getting a salted caramel square... OMG!).

It's not a gigantic coffee shop, with just one row of tables along the edge, but the brew is fresh, the food selection oh so tasty and its got free wifi. It's made a fan out of me and so far has left my coffee mates asking, \"How did you find this place?\""}
{"text":"Fabulous little cozy place. Really enjoyed the Americano. Didn't try the menu but it was tempting. Skip the Starbucks and Tim Hortons across the street and check out this gem."}
{"text":"This is a super cute Cafe. The coffee was gorgeous food was only good. I had the gluten free Mac and Cheese, it was a little bland. Everything on the menu can be made gluten free so I am going to go back to try some other items! Kid friendly too which was a huge plus."}
{"text":"The drink I ordered (the Mexi-Cocoa, Cornerstone's entry for the 2018 YYC Hot Chocolate Festival) was delicious, I was not disappointed and will probably go out of my way to get back here to have another one before the month is out.  And the person who served me was really nice, which is such a pleasant thing when you are paying for something, to be treated in a friendly manner."}
