{"text":"Zero Stars. Have been waiting over two hours for our food, called to see what was happening and the driver hasn't even picked it up yet. Food is okay but not worth the wait. Not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Wow! Worst food ever. The mall has better food.

Just don't .  

Not to mention the 1.5 hrs it took to arrive."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could. Placed our order online around 7:15pm. Received a call shortly after to take my credit card and was advised that delivery should take approximately 45 minutes. Food still hadn't arrived by 8:55pm so I called, was told that the restaurant got really busy but that they spoke to the driver and he's close and we should be receiving our order in about 5 minutes. Fine. 

At 9:13pm I receive a call asking to confirm if I still would like to receive my order!?!? I ask what happened to being 5 minutes away and was told that the driver was confused and that he didn't have my order. If I still wanted it, it would be about another hour but they would offer me 20% off. No way in hell was I waiting 3 hours (at least), so I cancelled my order and advised I will never ever be ordering from them again. 

We ordered pizza instead from the always excellent Pizzaville which came quickly and was delicious.

Stay as far away as humanly possible from this place."}
{"text":"High quality Chinese food. Will be going again. The orange chicken is superb its so good. I have never been to Toronto."}
{"text":"After ordering in last night due to the snow storm in Toronto Ho lee chow had the nerve to bring the worst peices of scrap to my house I've ever seen ( I won't disrespect the word \"food\") the peices of scrap was so bad I had to bring it back to them and to my suprise I found the filthiest restaurant in Toronto"}
{"text":"I used to like the old HLC for tasty, if expensive, Canadian Chinese food.
Since they went out of business, a few franchises have cropped up using the old name. They're still kind of pricey, but the taste and quality is GONE.

i was offered a measly 10% discount on my next (nonexistent) order when they screwed up my ginger beef. I settled for a replacement, when I should have insisted on a refund. The pork fried rice is easily the blandest I've ever tried, and after I got my beef, two hours after ordered, I couldn't eat it (and I'll eat doritos, so no food snob me), it was that disgusting.

ugh. if I could give it no stars, I would."}
{"text":"Was told it would be an hour for delivery. An hour and forty minutes later, still no food. Call them twice. Told both times it would be right there. They offered me a $4 credit on a $30 order. What a joke. Cancelled the order. Never again."}
{"text":"Seriously gross food!  I wouldn't recommend this place to you even if you stole my purse and racked up my credit card.  It's that bad."}
{"text":"One of the worst Chinese food experiences I have ever had. I had ordered it for delivery and was sadly disappointed. The chicken dish had little chicken but a ton of raw onions. The beef dish had a few small pieces of beef, a few large pieces of green pepper and a ton of raw onion, finally the vegetable dish had a few large pieces of peppers and carrots but again, tons of raw onions. My god; what is with the loads of raw onions."}
{"text":"It was not good at all and expensive I had the lemon chicken stir fry  and all it was a bunch of onions and green peppers with literally 6 small pieces of  chicken  paying  Almost 11 dollars for that it is to much I will never eat  there again"}
{"text":"I got takeout from here tonight and it ruined my night. I wish I just mustered up the energy to cook. This is so bad. Why didn't I look at the Yelp reviews before I ordered. I didn't know Chinese takeout could be this bad. I ordered a tonne.
Chicken chow mein. Wonton soup. General Tso chicken. Vegetable beef. 
Each dish is literally the worst version of itself I've ever tasted. Everything is bland, soggy and slimey. Tastes like survival bunker food. 

I would literally prefer to eat several plates of plain raw broccoli. I'm not overexaggurating. It's that bad. Whatever they did in the kitchen made it worse than just raw produce. 

I'm so depressed. Don't get food from here. There's never an excuse.

UPDATE : CAPTION FOR MY PIC: \"PUN CHIN BAG\" *wide eyed face, nodding head, pointing to brain* yeah. I thought of that."}
{"text":"Vile taste-free food.  They advertise they don't use MSG, but in their case they need it.  I've gone here twice.  Both times the food had no flavour at all, or it was disgusting.  Seriously they can even ruin chow-mein which is a pretty simple dish to make.  Just Google Ho Lee Chow, and you'll find it referred to as Ho Lee *four-letter-word*.

Its not all that cheap there either.  You're paying good money for insanely bad food. 

Don't go here unless you're actually starving to death, and want something edible that probably isn't poisonous."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!! 65$ and I'm so pissed off......BBQ pork was nauseating.... Not a grill mark on it...tasted like old steamed pork going bad they but some cheap dollar store sause on...beef was 95% vegetables...the chicken dish was 95% onions .....the chicken balls were 95% dough .....and EVERYTHING TASTED AWFUL......I've honestly never been so upset after ordering food....I feel like I've been treated like a punk....I'm some dumb a$$-&$# they just took as much of my money as possible and made ZERO effort in the food they gave me. 0\10 ....:-("}
{"text":"Worst chinese \"food\" ever. I wish I could give it a negative rating!!  

In the past, I've had chinese food that's maybe was too spicy, greasy, salty, etc for my liking..... but never chinese food that completely lack any flavour. It's really quite strange how everything is coated in a sauce... yet has no flavour?!!! Honestly confused how you could make such tasteless sauces...corn starch and food colouring??

Save your money, and eat somewhere else. This Chinese food will probably be the worst you will have have ... that was certainly the case for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food -- not just Chinese food, but food in general -- I have ever had delivered in my entire life! Not to mention, incredibly expensive for small portion sizes! That said, I'm glad the portions were small because it was less for me to throw out in the garbage. 

The overall flavor is just, sour and tangy. Almost as if it's completely spoiled. 

Hot garlic wings: 4/10
Vegetables with tofu: 3/10
Cantonese chow mein: 0/10
Garlic beef: 1/10
Vegetable fried rice: 6/10
Overall: 2/10 = 1 star rating"}

{"text":"Ok so their response (after arguing in circles) is that they always give out 6oz of chicken and 5oz of beef. They never give less. 

Also their policy is to only give a credit for future orders. They NEVER give a refund. 

I asked to speak to anyone above the customer service manager and she said that the CEO would look into the situation. I asked when I would be hearing back from him, and she said that he was (surprise surprise) on vacation. She couldn't give me a phone number or email address for him. 

After I told her I was going to the newspapers and tv news about their horrific service and sub par food, she told me that our conversation was being recorded. Isn't that illegal?  Don't they have to let customers know that their calls are being recorded at the beginning of the call??

Again, DO NOT EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, ORDER FROM HO-LEE-CHOW"}
{"text":"Ho Lee Chow! How did I not read these reviews first.  Bad.  Just... Bad.  Don't try it.  It took an hour and a half to get here - they promised 45 min."}
{"text":"We ordered $93.00 of food last night. Web site said 45 minute delivery, After 1.5 hours I called and they said it would be here in 5 minutes. 30 minutes later the driver showed up. One of the bags had leaked. 
Took the food and guess what? 
It was cold.
We ordered honey garlic ribs. The container was only half full and the sauce had become jelly. And cold.
The chicken balls were only partially cooked and very doughy inside.
The rice, which I generally love was really bad. It was all sticky and tasteless.
Years ago this was one of my favourite Chinese Take out, but I think they had problems and went out of business. They are back but the quality of food is not what it used to be. They are not cheap and Mandarin is a better deal for quality. Or better still go to your local neighbourhood Chinese Restaurant and use them.

I highly recommend anyone else but Ho Lee Chow!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered here on occasion that the Mrs. And I couldn't locate the menu for another Chinese Food restaurant that delivered in our area that we order from often. Our meal consisted of Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Balls, Vegetable Shanghai Noodles, and Lemon Chicken Stir fry. 

The rice was fine, not amazing, but fine, that being said it was the only item that was almost enjoyable. The Chicken Balls would've been more delightful were it not for a rather odd tasting sweet and sour sauce that tasted old and dull. The Vegetable Shanghai Noodles lacked taste and texture. Worst of them all was the lemon chicken stir fry, which failed to deliver on the lemon chicken. Amidst the entire bowl, lemon chicken filled merely a tenth of it. Now it wouldn't be so bad either, were it not for the sad truth that I couldn't bite through some of the undercooked vegetables. 

Needless to say, my wife and I won't be ordering here again. Ever. Again. Seriously."}
{"text":"I was about to write a scathing review about this place but, reading the other reviews I see that the world beat me to it.  Consider that bullet dodged."}
{"text":"Yes, I enjoy American style Chinese food and I was always satisfied with the food I ordered from Ho Lee Chow.  However it appears that this location has new ownership and since that happened the food has gone down hill.  My last pick-up order was tasteless and the vegetables were undercooked.   All I can say is I have not been back."}
{"text":"I have given this place quite a couple of chances now (it unfortunately being the only chinese place that does delivery in my area) and I have been incredibly dissapointed every single time.

Not that they even have the worst food around. When I do get my order it's usually alright tasting, at least for something I'm not expecting miracles from. But every single time there is some problem with my delivery. I've gone through almost every scenario now and I'm just tired of it to the point that I must give a bad review. In almost every single case the driver has delivered the food a good hour to two late (that is an hour or two PAST their 45-60 minute estimate) and almost every time the food is cold and has to be reheated even if I somehow get a chance to eat it right away.

Here are some examples:
1) The driver couldn't find my bulding because he was expecting a house. I should add that I made it clear in the online form that my location was a business and not a house. I called in and asked if they had a late policy and was told that they do not.
2) I was told that one of their drivers was sick and that they only had 1 that day.
3) I was told that my order was too large to meet the 45-60 minute estimate. I was surprised by this one because I ordered the \"For 1\" combo, the smallest one on a menu that goes up to 6.
4) The weather was bad. I got this one on the most recent occasion, when it took the driver 3 hours to deliver. I called in and complained once again, this time being told that they DO have a late policy but that they couldn't stick to it that day because it was a special day (it was snowing) and the driver had to drive really slowly (I am less than 10 km from the restuarant). I managed to get a heavenly $3.00 off my order for my troubles.

Overall I would simply never recommend this restuarant, at least definitely not at this location. I don't understand why it's so difficult to, at the very least, own up to your own mistakes and have decent customer service."}
{"text":"Ho lee chow? More like holy crap!!!! I have never eaten such bad food in my life and I've been to a 3 star hotel in cuba to eat. Their food is bland,  sauces are oily and taste nothing like they should taste like. Not to mention I separated the meat in both my entrees and each had a soup spoonful of meat at most. I have pictures as well but not sure if I can upload them here.  Moral of the story is if your hungry your better off raiding your neighbors garbage can for food than ordering from here."}
{"text":"Wow, we won't EVER order from here again! 
Food took 2 & 1/2 hours to be delivered, cold and congealed. Every time we called they told us they were very busy and it was 10mins away, blaming the driver. Perhaps they might consider staffing up for their busy nights?! When the driver finally appeared he said he was \"just given it\" which clearly wasn't true because the food was stone cold. 

I told the driver our meal should be complimentary at this point and asked him to call his manager. He had to return to his car to retrieve his phone and card machine. They gave us a small discount and offered a discount off our next order, which is clever because we WON'T EVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN. 

Save yourself the grief and starvation and order from ANYWHERE else!"}
{"text":"It's hard to get Chinese food wrong, but these guys managed it!

The food lacked the basic ingredient of salt. I paid 10 bucks for szechuan chicken which had maybe 3-4 tiny bits of chicken which I literally had to dig out from under mountains of onions. And the dish tasted like absolutely nothing. I mean last I checked, szechuan style food is particularly known for its spicyness. The fried rice was doused in sesame oil and the soup was completely rancid. They only thing bearable were the Asian spring rolls, but if there was shrimp in there, I couldn't find it.

Also contrary to the tag line on there menu and website, the food was neither fresh, nor fast. 

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner for one
The General Tao was soggy and the container was filled more with broccoli (raw) than chicken..
The beef fried rice was stale, and there was very little beef
The spring roll was not crispy and soaked in oil, took one bite, wiped the oil off my lips and fingers and threw it out.
The cherry on top...the fortune cookie tasted like it was made from cardboard.
I read a few different websites, everyone complains about the food...
How does this place make money? How is it still serving food to people? 
Worst food ever eaten in my life."}
{"text":"I should have checked Yelp before ordering for delivery. 

They made a mistake on one dish. Pork instead beef. I called right away and was told I was mistaken. They could not see the dish. The meat was white. It was not beef.

While they argued with me, my son refused to eat a chicken ball. I tried one and had to chew my way through the batter. It was really chewy. Other dishes were lower quality. I asked for a refund. They told me they would send someone over to pick up the food. Nobody arrived. 

We stopped eating the food, worried about the quality. I experienced stomach pain that night but thank goodness we did not eat more. 

Sent an email to head office. No response. 

$40 in food ended up in the compost. 

Order at your own risk."}
